PREFACE
DISTINGUISHING FEATURES
To date, more than six million students have learned about computers using a Discovering
Computers textbook. With the additional World Wide Web integration and interactivity, stream-
ing up-to-date audio and video, extraordinary step-by-step visual drawings and photographs,
unparalleled currency, and the Shelly and Cashman touch, this book will make your computer
concepts course exciting and dynamic. Distinguishing features of this book include:
A Proven Pedagogy
Careful explanations of complex concepts, educationally-sound elements, and reinforcement
highlight this proven method of presentation.
Essential Computer Concepts Coverage
This book offers the same breadth of topics as our well-known
Discovering Computers 2009: Complete, but the depth of coverage focuses
on the basic knowledge required to be computer literate in today’s digi-
tal world.
A Visually Appealing Book that Maintains Student Interest
The latest technology, pictures, drawings, and text are combined art-
fully to produce a visually appealing and easy-to-understand book.
Many of the figures include a step-by-step presentation (see page
141), which simplifies the more complex computer concepts. Pictures
and drawings reflect the latest trends in computer technology. 
Latest Technologies and Terms
The technologies and terms your students see in this book are
those they will encounter when they start using computers.
Only the latest application software packages are shown
throughout the book.
World Wide Web Enhanced
This book uses the World Wide Web as a major supplement. 
The purpose of integrating the World Wide Web into the book
is to (1) offer students additional information and currency on 
important topics; (2) use its interactive capabilities to offer cre-
ative reinforcement and online quizzes; (3) make available
alternative learning techniques with Web-based learning
games, practice tests, and interactive labs; (4) underscore the relevance of the World
Wide Web as a basic information tool that can be used in all facets of society; (5) introduce stu-
dents to doing research on the Web; and (6) offer instructors the opportunity to organize and
administer their traditional campus-based or distance-education-based courses on the Web
using the Blackboard platform. This textbook, however, does not
depend on Web access to be used successfully. The Web access
adds to the already complete treatment of topics within the book. 
Extensive End-of-Chapter Materials
A notable strength of this book is the extensive student activi-
ties at the end of each chapter. Well-structured student activities
can make the difference between students merely participating in
a class and students retaining the information they learn. The
activities in this book include: Chapter Review, Key Terms,
Checkpoint, Web Research, Learn How To, and Learn It Online.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS
FIGURE 1-1
People use all types and sizes of computers in their daily activities.
A WORLD OF COMPUTERS
C
omputers are everywhere: at work, at school, and at home (Figure 1-1). Mobile devices, 
such as many cell phones, often are classified as computers. Computers are a primary
means of local and global communication for billions of people. Employees correspond with
clients, students with classmates and teachers, and family with friends and other family members.
Through computers, society has instant access to information from around the globe. Local and
national news, weather reports, sports scores, airline schedules, telephone directories, maps and
directions, job listings, credit reports, and countless forms of educational material always are
accessible. From the computer, you can make a telephone call, meet new friends, share photos
and videos, share opinions, shop, book flights, file taxes, or take a course.
In the workplace, employees use computers to create correspondence such as e-mail messages,
memos, and letters; calculate payroll; track inventory; and generate invoices. Some applications
such as automotive design and weather forecasting use computers to perform complex mathemati-
cal calculations. At school, teachers use computers to assist with classroom instruction. Students 
use computers to complete assignments and research. Instead of attending class on campus, some
students take entire classes directly from their computer.

WHAT IS A COMPUTER?
People also spend hours of leisure time using a computer. They play games, listen to
music or radio broadcasts, watch or compose videos and movies, read books and maga-
zines, share stories, research genealogy, retouch photos, and plan vacations.
Many people believe that computer literacy is vital to success. Computer literacy, also
known as digital literacy, involves having a current knowledge and understanding of
computers and their uses. The requirements that determine computer literacy change as
technology changes.
This book presents the knowledge you need to be computer literate today. As you 
read this first chapter, keep in mind it is an overview. Many of the terms and concepts
introduced in this chapter will be discussed in more depth later in the book.
WHAT IS A COMPUTER?
A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored 
in its own memory, that can accept data, process the data according to specified rules, 
produce results, and store the results for future use.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Computers
Society has reaped many benefits from using computers. Both business and home users can
make well-informed decisions because they have instant access to information from anywhere in
the world. A user is anyone who communicates with a computer or utilizes the information it
generates. Students, another type of user, have more tools to assist them in the learning process.
Read Looking Ahead 1-1 for a look at the next generation of benefits from using computers.
ADVANTAGES OF USING COMPUTERS
The benefits of computers are possible because computers
have the advantages of speed, reliability, consistency, storage, and communications. 
• Speed: When data, instructions, and information flow along electronic circuits in a computer,
they travel at incredibly fast speeds. Many computers process billions or trillions of operations
in a single second.
• Reliability: The electronic components in modern computers are dependable and reliable
because they rarely break or fail. 
FIGURE 1-2
A computer processes data into information. In this
simplified example, the student identification number, semester, course
codes, and course grades all represent data. The computer processes
the data to produce the grade report (information).
Is data a singular or plural word?
The word data is plural for datum. With respect to computers, however, it is accepted and common practice to
use the word data in both the singular and plural context. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch1/faq
and then click Data.
An FAQ (frequently asked question) helps you find answers to commonly asked questions. Web sites often
post an FAQ section, and each chapter in this book includes FAQ boxes related to topics in the text.
Data and Information
Computers process data into information. Data is a collection of unprocessed items, which can
include text, numbers, images, audio, and video. Information conveys meaning and is useful to
people. 
As shown in Figure 1-2, for example, computers process several data items to print information
in the form of a grade report.

WHAT IS A COMPUTER?
• Consistency: Given the same input and processes, a computer will produce the same results —
consistently. Computers generate error-free results, provided the input is correct and the
instructions work.
• Storage: Computers store enormous amounts of data and make this data available for
processing anytime it is needed. 
• Communications: Most computers today can communicate with other computers, often
wirelessly. Computers allow users to communicate with one another. 
Paying by Cell Phone
Fumbling for spare change at a vending machine or swiping your credit card
at the checkout lane may be eliminated with upcoming contactless, or proxim-
ity, payments using a cell phone. By waving your phone in front of a mer-
chant’s wireless receiver, your credit or debit transactions can be completed
in seconds.
Contactless payments use a radio frequency to transmit account informa-
tion from a chip embedded in the phone to the merchant’s receiver. In test
studies, consumers using the proximity payments have decreased their time
waiting in line and increased the amount spent as much as 30 percent as
compared to using cash.
Security issues have been addressed in the test systems. For example, the transaction would
be initiated only when entering a password or PIN (personal identification number) on the
phone. Also, the cell phone must touch or pass within a few inches of the receiver in order to
complete the wireless payment.
For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch1/looking and then click Cell Phone Payments.
LOOKING AHEAD 1-1
DISADVANTAGES OF USING COMPUTERS
Some disadvantages of computers relate to the violation of
privacy, public safety, the impact on the labor force, health risks, and the impact on the environment.
• Violation of Privacy: In many instances, where personal and confidential records were not
protected properly, individuals have found their privacy violated and identities stolen.
• Public Safety: Adults, teens, and children around the world are using computers to share publicly
their photos, videos, journals, music, and other personal information. Some of these unsuspecting,
innocent computer users have fallen victim to crimes committed by dangerous strangers.
• Impact on Labor Force: Although computers have improved productivity and created an entire
industry with hundreds of thousands of new jobs, the skills of millions of employees have been
replaced by computers. Thus, it is crucial that workers keep their education up-to-date. A sep-
arate impact on the labor force is that some companies are outsourcing jobs to foreign countries
instead of keeping their homeland labor force employed.
• Health Risks: Prolonged or improper computer use can lead to health injuries or disorders.
Computer users can protect themselves from health risks through proper workplace design,
good posture while at the computer, and appropriately spaced work breaks. Another health risk,
called computer addiction, occurs when someone becomes obsessed with using the computer.
• Impact on Environment: Computer manufacturing processes and computer waste are
depleting natural resources and polluting the environment. Strategies that can help protect 
the environment include recycling, regulating manufacturing processes, extending the life of
computers, and immediately donating replaced computers.
Information Processing Cycle
Computers process data (input) into information (output). A computer often holds data, 
information, and instructions in storage for future use. Instructions are the steps that tell the
computer how to perform a particular task. Some people refer to the series of input, process, 
output, and storage activities as the information processing cycle. Recently, communications 
also has become an essential element of the information processing cycle.

THE COMPONENTS OF A COMPUTER
A computer contains many electric, electronic, and mechanical components known as 
hardware. These components include input devices, output devices, a system unit, storage
devices, and communications devices. Figure 1-3 shows some common computer hardware 
components.
Input Devices
An input device is any hardware component that allows you to enter data and instructions into 
a computer. Six widely used input devices are the keyboard, mouse, microphone, scanner, digital
camera, and Web cam (Figure 1-3).
A computer keyboard contains keys you press to enter data into the computer. A mouse is a
small handheld device. With the mouse, you control movement of a small symbol on the screen,
called the pointer, and you make selections from the screen.
A microphone allows a user to speak into the computer. A scanner converts printed material
(such as text and pictures) into a form the computer can use.
With a digital camera, you take pictures and then transfer the photographed images to the 
computer or printer instead of storing the images on traditional film. A Web cam is a 
digital video camera that allows users to create a movie or take still pictures electronically.

C6672_CH01_pp4.qxd  1/30/08  1:18 PM  Page 6

Output Devices
An output device is any hardware component that conveys information to one or more people.
Four commonly used output devices are a printer, a monitor, speakers, and a portable media
player (Figure 1-3).
A printer produces text and graphics on a physical medium such as paper. A monitor displays
text, graphics, and videos on a screen. Speakers allow you to hear music, voice, and other audio
(sounds). You can transfer audio, video, and digital images from a computer to a portable media
player, and then listen to the audio, watch the video, or view the images on the media player.
System Unit
The system unit is a case that contains electronic components of the computer that are used to
process data (Figure 1-3). The circuitry of the system unit usually is part of or is connected to a 
circuit board called the motherboard.
Two main components on the motherboard are the processor and memory. The processor, also
called the central processing unit (CPU), is the electronic component that interprets and carries
out the basic instructions that operate the computer. Memory consists of electronic components
that store instructions waiting to be executed and data needed by those instructions. Most memory
keeps data and instructions temporarily, which means its contents are erased when the computer 
is shut off.
Storage Devices
Storage holds data, instructions, and information for future use.
For example, computers can store hundreds or millions of customer
names and addresses. Storage holds these items permanently.
A computer keeps data, instructions, and information on storage
media. Examples of storage media are USB flash drives, hard
disks, CDs, DVDs, and memory cards. A storage device records
(writes) and/or retrieves (reads) items to and from storage media.
Storage devices often function as a source of input because they
transfer items from storage to memory.
A USB flash drive is a portable storage device that is small and
lightweight enough to be transported on a keychain or in a pocket
(Figure 1-3). The average USB flash drive can hold about 2 billion
characters.
A hard disk provides much greater storage capacity than a USB flash
drive. The average hard disk can hold more than 320 billion characters.
Hard disks are enclosed in an airtight, sealed case. Although some are
portable, most are housed inside the system unit (Figure 1-4). Portable 
hard disks are either external or removable. An external hard
disk is a separate, free-standing unit, whereas you insert and 
remove a removable hard disk from the computer or a device
connected to the computer.
A compact disc is a flat, round, portable metal disc with
plastic coating. One type of compact disc is a CD, which can
hold from 650 million to 1 billion characters. You can access a
CD using most CD and DVD drives (Figure 1-5). Another type
of compact disc is a DVD, which has enough storage capacity
to store two full-length movies or 17 billion characters. To
access a DVD, you need a DVD drive.
Some portable devices, such as digital cameras, use
memory cards as the storage media. You can use a card
reader/writer (Figure 1-3) to transfer stored items, such 
as digital photos, from the memory card to a computer 
or printer.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS
Communications Devices
A communications device is a hardware component that enables a computer to send (transmit)
and receive data, instructions, and information to and from one or more computers. A widely used
communications device is a modem (Figure 1-3 on page 6).
Communications occur over cables, telephone lines, cellular radio networks, satellites, and
other transmission media. Some transmission media, such as satellites and cellular radio
networks, are wireless, which means they have no physical lines or wires.
Test your knowledge of pages 2 through 8 in Quiz Yourself 1-1.
NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET
A network is a collection of computers and devices connected together, often wirelessly, via
communications devices and transmission media. When a computer connects to a network, it is
online. Networks allow computers to share resources, such as hardware, software, data, and
information. Sharing resources saves time and money.
The Internet is a worldwide collection of networks that connects millions of businesses, 
government agencies, educational institutions, and individuals (Figure 1-6). More than one billion
people around the world use the Internet daily for a vari-
ety of reasons, including the following: to com-
municate with and meet other people; to
conduct research and access a wealth
of information and news; to shop
for goods and services; to bank
and invest; to take a class; to
access sources of entertain-
ment and leisure, such as
travel directories, online
games, music, videos, 
books, and magazines; to
download music and
videos; and to share infor-
mation, photos, and videos.
Figure 1-7 shows examples in
each of these areas.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS
People connect to the Internet to exchange information with others
around the world. E-mail allows you to send messages to other users.
With instant messaging, you can have a live conversation with another
connected user. In a chat room, you can communicate with multiple
users at the same time — much like a group discussion. You also can
use the Internet to make a telephone call.
Businesses, called access providers, offer access to the Internet free 
or for a fee. By subscribing to an access provider, you can use your 
computer and a modem to connect to the many services of the Internet.
The Web, short for World Wide Web, is one of the more popular services
on the Internet. The Web contains billions of documents called Web pages.
A Web page can contain text, graphics, audio, and video. The eight screens
shown in Figure 1-7 on the previous page are examples of Web pages.
Web pages often have built-in connections, or links, to other documents,
graphics, other Web pages, or Web sites. A Web site is a collection of
related Web pages. Some Web sites allow users to access music and videos
that can be downloaded, or transferred to storage media in a computer or
portable media player, and then listen to the music through speakers,
headphones, or earphones, or view the videos on a display device.
Anyone can create a Web page and then make it available, or publish it,
on the Internet for others to see. Millions of people worldwide join online
communities, each called a social networking Web site, that encourage
members to share their interests, ideas, stories, photos, music, and videos with other registered
users. Hundreds of thousands of people today also use blogs to publish their thoughts on the Web.
A blog is an informal Web site consisting of time-stamped articles in a diary or journal format, usu-
ally listed in reverse chronological order. Podcasts are a popular way people verbally share informa-
tion on the Web. A podcast is recorded audio stored on a Web site that can be downloaded to a
computer or a portable media player such as an iPod.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE
Software, also called a program, is a series of instructions that tells the computer what to do and
how to do it. You interact with a program through its user interface. Software today often has a
graphical user interface. With a graphical user
interface (GUI pronounced gooey), you interact 
with the software using text, graphics, and visual
images such as icons (Figure 1-8). An icon is a minia-
ture image that represents a program, an instruction,
or some other object. You can use the mouse to select
icons that perform operations such as starting a
program. 
The two categories of software are system software
and application software.
System Software
System software consists of the programs that
control or maintain the operations of the computer
and its devices. System software serves as the inter-
face between the user, the application software, and
the computer’s hardware. Two types of system soft-
ware are the operating system and utility programs.

COMPUTER SOFTWARE
OPERATING SYSTEM
An operating system is a set of programs that coordinates all the activities
among computer hardware devices. It provides a means for users to communicate with the
computer and other software. Many of today’s computers use Windows Vista (Figure 1-8) or
Windows XP, two of Microsoft’s operating systems, or Mac OS X, Apple’s operating system.
When a user starts a computer, portions of the operating system load into memory from the
computer’s hard disk. It remains in memory while the computer is on. 
UTILITY PROGRAM
A utility program allows a user to perform maintenance-type tasks usually
related to managing a computer, its devices, or its programs. For example, you can use a utility
program to transfer digital photos to a CD or DVD. Most operating systems include several utility
programs for managing disk drives, printers, and other devices and media. You also can buy
utility programs that allow you to perform additional computer management functions.
Application Software
Application software consists of programs designed to make users
more productive and/or assist them with personal tasks. A widely
used type of application software related to communications is a Web
browser, which allows users with an Internet connection to access
and view Web pages. Other popular application software includes
word processing software, spreadsheet software, database software,
and presentation graphics software. 
Many other types of application software exist that enable users 
to perform a variety of tasks. These include personal information
management, note taking, project management, accounting, docu-
ment management, computer-aided design, desktop publishing,
paint/image editing, audio and video editing, multimedia authoring,
Web page authoring, personal finance, legal, tax preparation, home
design/landscaping, travel and mapping, education, reference, and
entertainment (e.g., games or simulations). As shown in Figure 1-9,
you often purchase application software from a store that sells com-
puter products. Read Ethics & Issues 1-1 for a related discussion.

What Can Be Done to Combat Computer Addiction?
The notion that a person can become addicted to computer use has existed since the 1970s. Today, the extensive list of activities that people
engage in with computers provides an ever growing list of reasons why some become computer addicted. While experts disagree on the spe-
cific definition of computer addiction, they generally agree that a person is computer addicted when obsessive use of a computer negatively
impacts health, personal life, and professional life. The media reports extreme examples of computer addiction with growing frequency. One
man died after playing a computer game for 86 hours while foregoing food and sleep. Another died after spending almost a week using a
computer. Such incidents are rare, but experts consider the problem to be widespread, especially among children. China classifies more than 
2.6 million people under the age of 18 as computer addicts. Sometimes mistakenly, parents feel that computer use is a healthier alternative to
television or video games and, therefore, permit excessive computer use. For adults, computer addiction often leads to less time spent with
family and has proven to be as potent a cause for divorce as gambling or substance abuse. What steps should parents and society take to
combat computer addiction? Why? How can software providers help to alleviate the problem? Should certain software include built-in timers
to disable the software after a certain number of hours, and then not enable it again until a set number of hours has elapsed? Why or why not?
Do you believe that those identified as computer addicts should receive health insurance benefits for counseling services? Why or why not?
ETHICS & ISSUES 1-1
Installing and Running Programs
The instructions in a program are stored on storage media such as a hard disk or compact disc.
When purchasing software from a computer store, you typically receive a box that includes a CD(s)
or DVD(s) that contains the program. If you purchase software from a Web site on the Internet, you
download the program; that is, the program is transferred from the Web site to the hard disk in
your computer. 
C6672_CH01_pp4.qxd  1/30/08  1:18 PM  Page 11

Step 1: INSTALL
When you insert a program disc, such as Microsoft 
Student, in the CD or DVD drive for the first time, the 
computer begins the procedure of installing the program 
on the hard disk.
Step 2: RUN
Once installed, you can instruct the computer to run 
the program. The computer transfers instructions
from the hard disk to memory.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS
Installing is the process of setting up software to work with the computer, printer, and other
hardware components. When you buy a computer, it usually has some software preinstalled 
on its hard disk. This enables you to use the computer the first time you turn it on. To begin
installing additional software from a CD or DVD, insert the program disc in a CD or DVD 
drive. When you download a purchased program, the Web site typically provides instructions 
for how to install the software on your hard disk. 
Once software is installed, you can run it. When you instruct the computer to run an installed
program, the computer loads it, which means the program is copied from storage to memory.
Once in memory, the computer can carry out, or execute, the instructions in the program so that
you can use the program. Figure 1-10 illustrates the steps that occur when a user installs and runs
a program that assists students with homework.
Software Development
A programmer, sometimes 
called a developer, is someone 
who develops software or writes
the instructions that direct the com-
puter to process data into informa-
tion. Complex programs can
require thousands to millions of
instructions.
Programmers use a programming
language or program development
tool to create computer programs.

CATEGORIES OF COMPUTERS
Industry experts typically classify computers in seven categories: personal computers, mobile
computers and mobile devices, game consoles, servers, mainframes, supercomputers, and
embedded computers. A computer’s size, speed, processing power, and price determine the cate-
gory it best fits. Due to rapidly changing technology, however, the distinction among categories 
is not always clear-cut. 
Figure 1-12 summarizes the seven categories of computers. The following pages discuss
computers and devices that fall in each category.

PERSONAL COMPUTERS
A personal computer is a computer that can perform all of its input, processing, output, and 
storage activities by itself. A personal computer contains a processor, memory, and one or more
input, output, and storage devices. They also often contain a communications device.
Two popular styles of personal computers are the PC (Figure 1-13) and the Apple (Figure 1-14).
These two types of computers use different operating systems. PC and PC-compatible computers
usually use a Windows operating system. Apple computers usually use a Macintosh operating
system (Mac OS X). The term, PC-compatible, refers to any personal computer based on the
original IBM personal computer design. Companies such as Dell and Toshiba sell PC-compatible
computers. 
Two types of personal computers are desktop computers and notebook computers. 
14
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS
FIGURE 1-13
The PC and PC-compatible
computers usually use a Windows operating system.
Desktop Computers
A desktop computer is designed so that the system unit, input devices, output devices, and any 
other devices fit entirely on or under a desk or table. In some models, the monitor sits on top of 
the system unit, which is placed on the desk. The more popular style of system unit is the tall and
narrow tower, which can sit on the floor vertically.
MOBILE COMPUTERS AND MOBILE DEVICES
A mobile computer is a personal computer you can carry from place to place. Similarly, a mobile
device is a computing device small enough to hold in your hand. The most popular type of
mobile computer is the notebook computer. 
Notebook Computers
A notebook computer, also called a laptop computer, is a portable, personal computer
designed to fit on your lap. Notebook computers are thin and lightweight, yet can be as power-
ful as the average desktop computer. Notebook computers usually are more expensive than
desktop computers with equal capabilities.
On a typical notebook computer, the keyboard is on top of the system unit, and the display
attaches to the system unit with hinges (Figure 1-15). These computers weigh on average from 
2.5 to more than 10 pounds (depending on configuration), which allows users easily to transport the
computers from place to place. Most notebook computers can operate on batteries or a power supply
or both.

MOBILE COMPUTERS AND MOBILE DEVICES
TABLET PC
Resembling a letter-sized slate, the Tablet PC is a special type
of notebook computer that allows you to write or draw on the screen using a digi-
tal pen (Figure 1-16). For users who prefer typing instead of handwriting, you can
attach a keyboard to Tablet PCs that do not include one already. Tablet PCs are useful
especially for taking notes in locations where the standard notebook computer is not
practical. Tablet PCs are used widely in the medical and legal communities.
Mobile Devices
Mobile devices, which are small enough to carry in a pocket, usually store programs
and data permanently on memory inside the system unit or on small storage media 
such as memory cards. You often can connect a mobile device to a personal computer 
to exchange information. Some mobile devices are Internet-enabled, meaning they can
connect to the Internet wirelessly. 
Three popular types of mobile devices are handheld computers, PDAs, and smart
phones.
HANDHELD COMPUTER
A handheld computer, sometimes referred to as Ultra-Mobile
PC (UMPC), is a computer small enough to fit in one hand. Because of their reduced
size, the screens on handheld computers are small. Industry-specific handheld comput-
ers serve mobile employees, such as parcel delivery people, whose jobs require them
to move from place to place. 
PDA
A PDA (personal digital assistant) provides personal organizer functions such
as a calendar, an appointment book, an address book, a calculator, and a notepad
(Figure 1-17). Most PDAs also offer a variety of other application software such as
word processing, spreadsheet, personal finance, and games. 
Many PDAs are Internet-enabled so that users can check e-mail and access the Web.
Some also provide camera and phone capabilities and can function as a portable
media player.
The primary input device of a PDA is the stylus, which looks like a small ballpoint pen,
but uses pressure instead of ink to write and draw.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS
SMART PHONE
Offering the convenience of 
one-handed operation, a smart phone is an Internet-
enabled phone that usually also provides PDA capabili-
ties. In addition to basic phone capabilities, a smart phone
allows you to send and receive e-mail messages and
access the Web — usually for an additional fee. Many
models also function as a portable media player and
include built-in cameras so that you can share photos or
videos (Figure 1-18).
As smart phones and PDAs continue a trend of offering
similar functions, it is becoming increasingly difficult to
differentiate between the two devices. This trend, known
as convergence, has led manufacturers to refer to PDAs
and smart phones simply as handhelds. Some factors that affect a consumer’s purchasing decision
include the device’s size, screen size, and capabilities of available software.
GAME CONSOLES
A game console is a mobile computing device designed for single-player or multiplayer video
games (Figure 1-19). Standard game consoles use a handheld controller(s) as an input device(s); a
television screen as an output device; and hard disks,
CDs, DVDs, and/or memory cards for storage. The
compact size and light weight of game consoles make
them easy to use at home, in the car, in a hotel, or any
location that has an electrical outlet. Three popular
models are Microsoft’s Xbox 360, Nintendo’s Wii, and
Sony’s PlayStation 3.
A handheld game console is small enough to fit in
one hand. With the handheld game console, the con-
trols, screen, and speakers are built into the device.
Some models use cartridges to store games; others use
a miniature type of CD or DVD. Many handheld game
consoles can communicate wirelessly with other simi-
lar consoles for multiplayer gaming. Two popular
models are Nintendo DS Lite and Sony’s PlayStation
Portable (PSP). 
In addition to gaming, many console models allow
users to listen to music, watch movies, and connect to
the Internet.
SERVERS
A server controls access to the hardware, software, and other
resources on a network and provides a centralized storage
area for programs, data, and information (Figure 1-20).
Servers support from two to several thousand connected
computers at the same time.
People use personal computers or terminals to access 
data, information, and programs on a server. A terminal is 
a device with a monitor, keyboard, and memory.

EMBEDDED COMPUTERS
MAINFRAMES
A mainframe is a large, expensive, powerful computer 
that can handle hundreds or thousands of connected users
simultaneously (Figure 1-21). Mainframes store huge
amounts of data, instructions, and information. Most major
corporations use mainframes for business activities. With
mainframes, large businesses are able to bill millions of
customers, prepare payroll for thousands of employees, 
and manage thousands of items in inventory. One study
reported that mainframes process more than 83 percent 
of transactions around the world.
Servers and other mainframes can access data and infor-
mation from a mainframe. People also can access programs
on the mainframe using terminals or personal computers.
SUPERCOMPUTERS
A supercomputer is the fastest, most powerful 
computer — and the most expensive (Figure 1-22). 
The fastest supercomputers 
are capable of processing 
more than 135 trillion
instructions in a single 
second.
Applications requiring
complex, sophisticated
mathematical calculations 
use supercomputers. Large-
scale simulations and applica-
tions in medicine, aerospace,
automotive design, online
banking, weather forecasting,
nuclear energy research, and
petroleum exploration use a
supercomputer.
FIGURE 1-21
Mainframe computers can handle
thousands of connected computers and process
millions of instructions per second.
EMBEDDED COMPUTERS
An embedded computer is a special-purpose computer that functions as a component in a larger
product. A variety of everyday products contain embedded computers: 
• Consumer electronics
• Home automation devices
• Automobiles
• Process controllers and robotics
• Computer devices and office machines
FIGURE 1-22
This supercomputer simulates various environmental occurrences such as
global climate changes, pollution, and earthquakes.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS
Because embedded computers are components in larger products, they usually are small and
have limited hardware. Embedded computers perform various functions, depending on the
requirements of the product in which they reside. Embedded computers in printers, for example,
monitor the amount of paper in the tray, check the ink or toner level, signal if a paper jam has
occurred, and so on. Figure 1-23 shows some of the many embedded computers in cars.
EXAMPLES OF COMPUTER USAGE
Every day, people around the world rely on different types of computers for a variety of applications.
To illustrate the range of uses for computers, this section takes you on a visual and narrative tour of
five categories of users: a home user, a small office/home office (SOHO) user, a mobile user, a power
user, and a large business user.
Home User
In an increasing number of homes, the computer is a basic necessity. Each family member, or home
user, spends time on the computer for different reasons. These include budgeting and personal financial
management, Web access, communications, and entertainment (Figure 1-24). 
On the Internet, home users access a huge amount of information, conduct research, take college
classes, pay bills, manage investments, shop, listen to the radio, watch movies, read books, play games,
file taxes, book airline reservations, and make telephone calls. They also communicate with others
around the world through e-mail, blogs, instant messaging, and chat rooms. Home users share ideas,
interests, photos, music, and videos on social networking Web sites, or online social networks.
Many home users have a portable media player, so that they can listen to downloaded music
and/or podcasts at a later time through earphones attached to the player. They also usually have
one or more game consoles to play video games.
Today’s homes typically have one or more desktop computers. Some home users network
multiple desktop computers throughout the house, often wirelessly. These small networks allow
family members to share an Internet connection and a printer. 
Home users have a variety of software. They type letters, homework assignments, and other
documents with word processing software. Personal finance software helps the home user with per-
sonal finances, investments, and family budgets. Other software assists with preparing taxes, keeping a
household inventory, setting up maintenance schedules, and protecting computers against threats and
unauthorized intrusions (read Ethics & Issues 1-2 for a related discussion).
Cars equipped with wireless 
communications capabilities, 
called telematics, include 
such features as navigation 
systems and Internet access.
Tire pressure monitoring 
systems send warning 
signals if tire pressure 
is insufficient.
Drive-by-wire systems sense 
pressure on the gas pedal and communicate 
electronically to the engine how much and 
how fast to accelerate.
Adaptive cruise control 
systems detect if cars in 
front of you are too close 
and, if necessary, adjust
the vehicle’s throttle,
may apply brakes, and/or 
sound an alarm.
Advanced airbag systems 
have crash-severity sensors 
that determine the appropriate 
level to inflate the airbag, 
reducing the chance of 
airbag injury in low-speed 
accidents.

Can I watch
a DVD on my
computer?
Yes, in most cases.
Simply insert the DVD
in the computer’s DVD
drive. Within a few
seconds, you should
see the DVD begin to
play on your com-
puter’s screen. If the
DVD does not play, it
is possible you need 
to run a program that
starts the DVD. For

EXAMPLES OF COMPUTER USAGE
Reference software, such as encyclopedias, medical dictionaries, or a road atlas, provides 
valuable information for everyone in the family. With entertainment software, the home user can
play games, compose music, research genealogy, or create greeting cards. Educational software
helps adults learn to speak a foreign language and youngsters to read, write, count, and spell.
ETHICS & ISSUES 1-2
What Should Be Done about Identity Theft?
Using e-mail and other techniques on the Internet, scam artists are employing a technique known as phishing to try to steal your personal
information, such as credit card numbers, banking information, and passwords. For example, an e-mail message may appear to be a request
from your credit card company to verify your Social Security number and online banking password. Instead, the information you submit
ends up in the hands of the scammer, who then uses the information for a variety of unethical and illegal acts. Sadly, the result often is iden-
tity theft. You can help to deter identity theft in several ways: 1) shred your financial documents before discarding them, 2) do not click links
in unsolicited e-mail messages, and 3) enroll in a credit monitoring service. Consumer advocates often blame credit card companies and
credit bureaus for lax security standards. Meanwhile, the companies blame consumers for being too gullible and forthcoming with private
information. Both sides blame the government for poor privacy laws and light punishments for identity thieves. But while the arguments go
on, law enforcement agencies bear the brunt of the problem by spending hundreds of millions of dollars responding to complaints and find-
ing and processing the criminals. Who should be responsible for protecting the public from Internet identity theft? Why? Should laws be
changed to stop it, or should consumers change behavior? What is an appropriate punishment for identity thieves? Given the international
nature of the Internet, how can foreign identity thieves be handled?

Small Office/Home Office User
Computers assist small business and home office users in managing their resources effectively. A
small office/home office (SOHO) includes any company with fewer than 50 employees, as well as the
self-employed who work from home. Small offices include local law practices, accounting firms, travel
agencies, and florists. SOHO users typically use a desktop computer. Many also use smart phones.
SOHO users access the Internet — often wirelessly — to look up information such as addresses
(Figure 1-25a), directions, postal codes, flights, and package shipping rates or to make telephone calls.
Nearly all SOHO users communicate through
e-mail. Many have entered the e-commerce
arena and conduct business on the Web. Their
Web sites advertise products and services and
may provide a means for taking orders. 
To save money on hardware and software,
small offices often network their computers.
For example, the small office connects one
printer to a network for all employees to
share.
SOHO users often have basic business
software such as word processing and
spreadsheet software to assist with docu-
ment preparation and finances (Figure 1-25b).
They are likely to use other industry-specific
types of software. A candy shop, for example,
will have software that allows for taking
orders and payments, updating inventory,
and paying vendors.
Mobile User
Today, businesses and schools are
expanding to serve people across the country
and around the world. Thus, increasingly
more employees and students are mobile
users, who work on a computer while away
from a main office, home office, or school
(Figure 1-26). Some examples of mobile users
are sales representatives, real estate agents,
insurance agents, meter readers, package
delivery people, journalists, and students.

EXAMPLES OF COMPUTER USAGE
Mobile users often have a notebook computer, Tablet PC, smart phone, or other mobile device.
With these computers and devices, the mobile user can connect to other computers on a network 
or the Internet, often wirelessly accessing services such as e-mail and the Web. Mobile users can
transfer information between their mobile devices and another computer.
The mobile user works with basic business software such as word processing and spreadsheet
software. With presentation graphics software, the mobile user can create and deliver presenta-
tions to a large audience by connecting a mobile computer or device to a video projector that
displays the presentation on a full screen.
Power User
Another category of user, called a power user, requires the
capabilities of a powerful desktop computer, called a work-
station. Examples of power users include engineers, scientists,
architects, desktop publishers, and graphic artists (Figure 1-27).
Power users typically work with multimedia, combining text,
graphics, audio, and video into one application. These users
need computers with extremely fast processors because of the
nature of their work.
The power user’s workstation contains industry-specific
software. For example, engineers and architects use software
to draft and design floor plans, mechanical assemblies, or vehi-
cles. A desktop publisher uses software to prepare marketing
literature. A graphic artist uses software to create sophisticated
drawings. This software usually is expensive because of its
specialized design.
Power users exist in all types of businesses. Some also work at
home. Their computers typically have network connections and
Internet access.
Large Business User
A large business has hundreds or thousands of employees or customers that work in or do
business with offices across a region, the country, or the world. Each employee or customer who
uses a computer in the large business is a large business user (Figure 1-28). 
Many large companies use the words, enterprise computing, to refer to the huge network of
computers that meets their diverse computing needs. The network facilitates communications
among employees at all locations. Users access the network through desktop computers, mobile
computers, and mobile devices.
Large businesses use computers and the computer network to process high volumes of transactions
in a single day. Although they may differ in size and in the products or services offered, all generally
use computers for basic business activities. For example, they bill millions of customers or prepare
payroll for thousands of employees. Some large businesses use blogs to open
communications among employees and/or customers.
Large businesses typically have e-commerce Web sites, allowing customers
and vendors to conduct business online. The Web site showcases products, serv-
ices, and other company information. Customers, vendors, and other interested
parties can access this information on the Web.
The marketing department in a large business uses desktop publishing soft-
ware to prepare marketing literature. The accounting department uses soft-
ware for accounts receivable, accounts payable, billing, general ledger, and
payroll activities.
Large business users work with word processing, spreadsheet, database, and
presentation graphics software. They also may use calendar programs to post
their schedules on the network. And, they might use smart phones or other
mobile devices to maintain contact information. E-mail programs and Web
browsers enable communications among employees, vendors, and customers.

Education
Education is the process of acquiring knowledge. In
the traditional model, people learn from other people
such as parents, teachers, and employers. Many forms of
printed material such as books and manuals are used as
learning tools. Today, educators also are turning to com-
puters to assist with education (Figure 1-30).
Many schools and companies equip labs and class-
rooms with computers. Some schools require students
to have a notebook computer or mobile device to access
the school’s network or Internet wirelessly.
Students use software to assist with learning or to 
complete assignments. To promote education by
computer, many vendors offer substantial student
discounts on software.
Many employees of large businesses today telecommute
(Figure 1-29). Telecommuting is a work arrangement in
which employees work away from a company’s standard
workplace and often communicate with the office through
the computer. Employees who telecommute have flexi-
ble work schedules so that they can combine work and
personal responsibilities, such as child care.
COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN SOCIETY
The computer has changed society today as much as the
industrial revolution changed society in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries.
People interact directly with computers in fields such as
education, finance, government, health care, science, pub-
lishing, travel, and manufacturing. In addition, they can
reap the benefits from breakthroughs and advances in these
fields. The following pages describe how computers have made a difference in people’s interactions 
with these disciplines. Read Looking Ahead 1-2 for a look at the next generation of computer
applications in society.

Robots Perform Mundane, Dangerous Tasks
Playwright Karel Capek created the name, robot, for his humanoid machines that turned
against their creators. Today, mobile, intelligent robots perform tasks typically reserved for
humans in a $5 billion global market.
Tomorrow’s practical and versatile robots will serve a variety of personal and industrial
needs. By 2010, the expected $17 billion market should include products to care for senior
citizens, transport people in major cities, and perform hundreds of thousands of mobile
utility jobs, such as picking up and delivering items. 
The Anna Konda is a snakelike robot built by Norway’s Foundation for Industrial and
Scientific Research that can maneuver over varied terrain. Engineers envision its possible
uses include fighting fires, locating and bringing oxygen to earthquake victims buried under debris, and per-
forming maintenance on underwater oil rigs. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch1/looking and

COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN SOCIETY
Sometimes, the delivery of education occurs at
one place while the learning occurs at other loca-
tions. For example, students can take a class on the
Web. More than 70 percent of colleges offer some
type of distance learning classes. A few even offer
entire degrees online.
Finance
Many people and companies use computers to
help manage their finances. Some use finance soft-
ware to balance checkbooks, pay bills, track personal
income and expenses, manage investments, and eval-
uate financial plans. This software usually includes a
variety of online services. For example, computer
users can track investments and do online banking
(Figure 1-31). With online banking, users access
account balances, pay bills, and copy monthly trans-
actions from the bank’s computer right into their
computers.
Investors often use online investing to buy and
sell stocks and bonds — without using a broker.
With online investing, the transaction fee for each
trade usually is much less than when trading
through a broker.
Government
A government provides society with direction by making and
administering policies. To provide citizens with up-to-date infor-
mation, most government offices have Web sites. People access
government Web sites to file taxes, apply for permits and licenses,
pay parking tickets, buy stamps, report crimes, apply for financial
aid, and renew vehicle registrations and driver’s licenses. 
Employees of government agencies use computers as part of 
their daily routine. Military and other agency officials use the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security’s network of information about
domestic security threats to help protect our nation. Law enforce-
ment officers have online access to the FBI’s National Crime
Information Center (NCIC) through in-vehicle computers, finger-
print readers, and mobile devices (Figure 1-32). The NCIC contains
more than 52 million missing persons and criminal records, includ-
ing names, fingerprints, parole/probation records, mug shots, and
other information.
Health Care
Nearly every area of health care uses computers. Whether you are visiting a family doctor 
for a regular checkup, having lab work or an outpatient test, or being rushed in for emergency
surgery, the medical staff around you will be using computers for various purposes:
• Doctors use the Web and medical software to assist with researching and diagnosing health
conditions.
• Doctors use e-mail to correspond with patients.
• Pharmacists use computers to file insurance claims.
• Robots can deliver medication to nurse stations in hospitals.
• Computers and computerized devices assist doctors, nurses, and technicians with medical
tests.
FIGURE 1-32

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS
• Hospitals and doctors use computers and mobile
devices to maintain and access patient records
(Figure 1-33).
• Computers monitor patients’ vital signs in
hospital rooms and at home.
• Surgeons implant computerized devices, such as
pacemakers, that allow patients to live longer.
• Surgeons use computer-controlled devices to
provide them with greater precision during
operations, such as for laser eye surgery 
and robot-assisted heart surgery.
Two forms of long-distance health care are
telemedicine and telesurgery. Through telemedicine,
health-care professionals in separate locations con-
duct live conferences on the computer. For example,
a doctor at one location can have a conference with 
a doctor at another location to discuss a bone X-ray.
Live images of each doctor, along with the X-ray, are
displayed on each doctor’s computer.
With telesurgery, a surgeon performs an
operation on a patient who is not located in the
same physical room as the surgeon. Telesurgery
enables surgeons to direct robots to perform 
an operation via computers connected to a 
high-speed network.
Science
All branches of science, from biology to astronomy to meteorology, use computers to assist
them with collecting, analyzing, and modeling data. Scientists also use the Internet to communicate
with colleagues around the world.
Breakthroughs in surgery, medicine, and treatments often result from scientists’ use of comput-
ers. Tiny computers now imitate functions of the central nervous system, retina of the eye, and
cochlea of the ear. A cochlear implant allows a deaf person to listen. Electrodes implanted in the
brain stop tremors associated with Parkinson’s disease. Cameras small enough to swallow —
sometimes called a camera pill — take pictures inside your body to detect polyps, cancer, and
other abnormalities (Figure 1-34).
FIGURE 1-33
Doctors, nurses, technicians,
and other medical staff use computers and
mobile devices to access patient records.
Step 1:
A patient swallows a tiny capsule that 
contains a miniature disposable camera, 
lights, a transmitter, and batteries. The
camera is positioned at the clear end of 
the capsule.
Step 2:
As the capsule moves through the inside of the
patient’s body, the camera snaps about 50,000 
pictures, which are transmitted to a recording 
device worn as a belt on the patient’s waist.
Step 3:
The doctor transfers the data on the 
recording device to a computer so 
it can be processed and analyzed.

COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN SOCIETY
Publishing
Publishing is the process of making
works available to the public. These
works include books, magazines, news-
papers, music, film, and video. Special
software assists graphic designers in
developing pages that include text,
graphics, and photos; artists in com-
posing and enhancing songs; film-
makers in creating and editing film;
and journalists and mobile users in
capturing and modifying video clips.
Many publishers make their works
available online (Figure 1-35). Some
Web sites allow you to copy the work,
such as a book or music, to your desk-
top computer, handheld computer,
smart phone, or other mobile device.
Travel
Many vehicles manufactured 
today include some type of onboard 
navigation system. Some mobile users
prefer to carry specialized handheld
navigation devices (Figure 1-36).
In preparing for a trip, you may
need to reserve a car, hotel, or flight.
Many Web sites offer these services to
the public. For example, you can order
airline tickets on the Web. If you plan
to drive somewhere and are unsure of
the road to take to your destination,
you can print directions and a map
from the Web.
Manufacturing
Computer-aided manufacturing
(CAM) refers to the use of computers 
to assist with manufacturing processes
such as fabrication and assembly.
Often, robots carry out processes in a
CAM environment. CAM is used by a
variety of industries, including oil
drilling, power generation, food pro-
duction, and automobile manufactur-
ing. Automobile plants, for example,
have an entire line of industrial robots
that assemble a car (Figure 1-37). 
FIGURE 1-35
Many magazine and newspaper publishers make the 
content of their publications available online.

Personal Computer Salesperson
When you decide to buy or upgrade a personal computer, the most important 
person with whom you interact probably will be a personal computer sales-
person. This individual will be a valuable resource to you in providing the 
information and expertise you need to select a computer that meets your 
requirements.
Computer manufacturers and retailers that sell several types of personal 
computers need competent salespeople. A personal computer salesperson must be computer literate and
have a specific knowledge of the computers he or she sells. The salesperson also must have a working
knowledge of computer peripherals (printers, scanners, cameras, etc.). In addition, a successful salesperson
has a friendly, outgoing personality that helps customers feel comfortable. Through open-ended questions,
the salesperson can determine a customer’s needs and level of experience. With this information, the sales-
person can choose the best computer for the customer and explain the features of the computer in language
the customer will understand. Most computer salespeople also can recommend a qualified installer for your
computer or qualified service technician.
Computer salespeople typically have at least a high school diploma. Before reaching the sales floor,
however, salespeople usually complete extensive company training programs. These programs often con-
sist of self-directed, self-paced Web-training classes. Most salespeople also participate in training updates,
often on a monthly basis. 
Personal computer salespeople generally earn a guaranteed amount plus a commission for each sale. A
computer salesperson can earn about $45,000 a year. Top salespeople can be among a company’s more
highly compensated employees, earning in excess of $90,000 including commissions. For more information,

Bill Gates
Microsoft’s Founder
Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft Corporation, suggests that college students should learn how to learn by getting the
best education they can. Because he is considered by many as the most powerful person in the computing industry, it
might be wise to listen to him.
Gates learned to program computers when he was 13. Early in his career, he developed the BASIC programming
language for the MITS Altair, one of the first microcomputers. He founded Microsoft in 1975 with Paul Allen, and five years
later, they provided the first operating system, called MS-DOS, for the IBM PC. Today, Microsoft’s Windows and Office
products dominate the software market.
In July 2008, Gates relinquished his day-to-day role in the company. He continues as chairman and advisor while devoting
more time to his philanthropic efforts. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch1/people and then click Bill Gates.
Anne Mulcahy
Xerox CEO
Color printing and consulting services are the two areas where the Xerox Corporation can make a difference, according to
Anne Mulcahy, the company’s CEO and chairman of the board. She should know the nature of the business, having started
her career with the Stamford, Connecticut-based corporation more than 30 years ago as a field sales representative.
One of Mulcahy’s first decisions after landing the top job in 2001 was eliminating the corporation’s tagline, “The
Document Company.” She believes the company’s name, standing solo, speaks for itself in the printing, copying, and
services worlds. Her ethical and values-based leadership decisions to revamp the company have revolved around Xerox’s
roots of innovation and customer care. She is a member of the boards of directors of Target Corporation, Citigroup, and
Catalyst, a not-for-profit organization supporting women in business. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch1/

Dell
Direct Business Computer Manufacturer
As a leading manufacturer of personal computers, Dell prides itself on its direct
approach to computer sales. The company hosts one of the world’s largest volume 
e-commerce Web sites where customers can configure and price computers and
electronic components, order computers, and track their orders online.
Founded by Michael Dell in 1984, the company sells more computers globally than
any computer company, placing it 34th on the FORTUNE 500.
Dell partnered with Ask.com in 2007 to develop energy-efficient servers for the
search engine company. Ask.com became Dell's first corporate participant in the
“Plant a Tree for Me” program, which helps protect the environment by planting
thousands of trees to offset carbon emissions associated with the electricity gener-
ated to power computer equipment. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/
ch1/companies and then click Dell.
Apple Computer
Introducing Innovative Technologies
Millions of computer users in more than 120 countries loyally use Apple Computer’s
hardware and software with a passion usually reserved for sports teams and musical
groups.
Steven Jobs and Stephen Wozniak founded Apple in 1976 when they marketed the
Apple I, a circuit board they had developed in Jobs’s garage. In 1977, Apple Computer
incorporated and introduced the Apple II, the first mass-marketed personal computer.
Apple introduced the Macintosh product line in 1984, which featured a graphical user
interface.
Under Jobs’s direction as CEO, Apple introduced award-winning desktop and
notebook computers, the OS X operating system, iWork, iLife, and professional
applications. The iPod is the world’s most popular portable media player, and the
iTunes Music Store is the number one online music store. Apple entered the smart 
phone market in 2007 with its iPhone. For more information, visit scsite.com/

Chapter Review
The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students regarding
any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch1/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
Why Is Computer Literacy Important?
Computer literacy, also called digital literacy, involves having current knowledge and understanding of computers and
their uses. As computers become an increasingly important part of daily living, many people believe that computer literacy
is vital to success.
What Are the Components of a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory, that can accept data,
process the data according to specified rules, produce results, and store the results for future use. The electric, electronic, and
mechanical components of a computer, or hardware, include input devices, output devices, a system unit, storage devices,
and communications devices. An input device allows you to enter data or instructions into a computer. An output device
conveys information to one or more people. The system unit is a case that contains the electronic components of a computer
that are used to process data. A storage device records and/or retrieves items to and from storage media. A communications
device enables a computer to send and receive data, instructions, and information to and from one or more computers.
How Are the Internet and World Wide Web Used?
The Internet is a worldwide collection of networks that connects millions of businesses, government agencies, educational
institutions, and individuals. People use the Internet to communicate with and meet other people; conduct research and
access information and news; shop for goods and services; bank and invest; take classes; for entertainment and leisure; down-
load music and videos; and share information, photos, and videos. The Web, short for World Wide Web, contains billions of
documents called Web pages.
What Are the Categories of Software?
Software, also called a program, is a series of instructions that tells the computer what to do and how to do it. The two
categories of software are system software and application software. System software consists of the programs that control or
maintain the operations of a computer and its devices. Two types of system software are the operating system, which coor-
dinates activities among computer hardware devices, and utility programs, which perform maintenance-type tasks usually
related to managing a computer, its devices, or its programs. Application software consists of programs designed to make
users more productive and/or assist them with personal tasks. Popular application software includes Web browser, word
processing software, spreadsheet software, database software, and presentation graphics software.
What Are the Categories of Computers?
Industry experts typically classify computers into seven categories: personal computers, mobile computers and mobile
devices, game consoles, servers, mainframes, supercomputers, and embedded computers. A personal computer is a
computer that can perform all of its input, processing, output, and storage activities by itself. A mobile computer is a
personal computer that you can carry from place to place, and a mobile device is a computing device small enough to
hold in your hand. A game console is a mobile computing device designed for single-player or multiplayer video games.
A server controls access to the hardware, software, and other resources on a network and provides a centralized storage
area for programs, data, and information. A mainframe is a large, expensive, powerful computer that can handle hun-
dreds or thousands of connected users simultaneously and can store huge amounts of data, instructions, and information.
A supercomputer is the fastest, most powerful, and most expensive computer and is used for applications requiring
complex, sophisticated mathematical calculations. An embedded computer is a special-purpose computer that functions
as a component in a larger product.

What Are the Types of Computer Users?
Computer users can be separated into five categories: home user, small office/home office user, mobile user, power user, and
large business user. A home user is a family member who uses a computer for a variety of reasons, such as budgeting and
personal financial management, Web access, communications, and entertainment. A small office/home office (SOHO)
includes any company with fewer than 50 employees or a self-employed individual who works from home and uses basic
business software and sometimes industry-specific software. Mobile users are employees and students who work on a com-
puter while away from a main office, home office, or school. A power user can exist in all types of businesses and uses pow-
erful computers to work with industry-specific software. A large business user works in or interacts with a company with
many employees and uses a computer and computer network that processes high volumes of transactions in a single day.
What Computer Applications Are Used in Society?
You may interact directly with computers in fields such as education, finance, government, health care, science, publishing,
travel, and manufacturing. In education, students use computers and software to assist with learning or take distance learn-
ing classes. In finance, people use computers for online banking to access information and online investing to buy and
sell stocks and bonds. Government offices have Web sites to provide citizens with up-to-date information, and govern-
ment employees use computers as part of their daily routines. In health care, computers are used to maintain patient
records, assist doctors with medical tests and research, file insurance claims, provide greater precision during operations,
and as implants. All branches of science use computers to assist with collecting, analyzing, and modeling data and to
communicate with scientists around the world. Publishers use computers to assist in developing pages and make their
works available online. Many vehicles use some type of online navigation system to help people travel more quickly and
safely. Manufacturers use computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) to assist with manufacturing processes.

Dr. John V. Atanasoff and
Clifford Berry design and build
the first electronic digital
computer. Their machine, the
Atanasoff-Berry-
Computer, or 
ABC, provides the
foundation for
advances in electronic
digital computers.
During World War II, British
scientist Alan Turing designs the
Colossus, an electronic computer
created for the military to break
German codes. The computer's
existence is kept secret until the
1970s.
John von Neumann poses in front of the
electronic computer built at the Institute
for Advanced Study. This computer and
its von Neumann architecture served as
the prototype for subsequent stored
program computers worldwide.
Dr. John W. Mauchly and J. Presper
Eckert, Jr. complete work on the
first large-scale electronic, general-
purpose digital computer. The
ENIAC (Electronic Numerical
Integrator And Computer) weighs
30 tons, contains 18,000 vacuum
tubes, occupies a 30 3 50 foot
space, and consumes 160 kilowatts
of power. The first time it is turned
on, lights dim in an entire section 
of Philadelphia.
The first commercially available
electronic digital computer, the
UNIVAC I (UNIVersal Automatic
Computer), is introduced by
Remington Rand. Public
awareness of computers increases
when the UNIVAC I, after
analyzing only five percent of the
popular vote, correctly predicts
that Dwight D. Eisenhower will
win the presidential election.
William Shockley, John Bardeen,
and Walter Brattain invent
the transfer resistance device,
eventually called the transistor.
The transistor would revolutionize
computers, proving much more
reliable than vacuum tubes.

Dr. Grace Hopper considers
the concept of reusable
software in her paper, “The
Education of a Computer.” The
paper describes how to
program a computer with
symbolic notation instead of
the detailed machine language
that had been used.
The IBM model 650 is one of the first
widely used computers. Originally planning
to produce only 50 machines, the system
is so successful that eventually IBM
manufactures more than 1,000. With the
IBM 700 series of machines, the company
will dominate the mainframe market for the
next decade.
Core memory, developed in the early
1950s, provides much larger storage
capacity than vacuum tube memory.
Fortran (FORmula TRANslation),
an efficient, easy-to-use
programming language,
is introduced by John Backus.
Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments invents
the integrated circuit, which lays the
foundation for high-speed computers and
large-capacity memories. Computers built
with transistors mark the beginning of the
second generation of computer hardware.
The IBM 305 RAMAC system is the first to use
magnetic disk for external storage. The system
provides storage capacity similar to magnetic
tape that previously was used, but offers the
advantage of semi-
random access
capability.
More than 200 programming
languages have been created.
IBM introduces two smaller,
desk-sized computers: the IBM
1401 for business and the IBM
1620 for scientists. The IBM
1620 initially is called the CADET,
but IBM drops the name when
campus wags claim it is an
acronym for, Can’t Add, Doesn’t
Even Try.
COBOL, a high-level business
application language, is
developed by a committee
headed by Dr. Grace Hopper.
COBOL uses English-like
phrases and runs on most
business computers, making it
one of the more widely used
programming languages.

In response to Apple’s popular iPod, Microsoft
unveils the Zune. Among its features is a 
30 GB portable media player; the Zune
Marketplace music service; wireless tech-
nology; a built-in FM tuner; and a bright, 
3’’ screen.
Web 2.0, a term
coined in 2004, becomes a household term with the
popularity of social networking Web sites such as
MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube. MySpace reaches
80 million registered users, most between the ages of
18 and 40. Facebook surpasses 13 million registered
users and becomes the number one photo sharing
site on the Web. YouTube becomes the most popular
video sharing Web site with people watching and
sharing more than 70 million videos a day.
Google, founded in 1998,
is the most used search
engine, capturing 54 percent of the market
over Yahoo! and MSN. It is estimated that
Google receives approximately 1 billion
search requests per day.
Intel introduces its Core 2 Duo processor
family. Boasting record-breaking performance
while using less power, the family consists of
five desktop computer processors and five
mobile computer processors. The desktop
processor includes 291 million transistors, 
yet uses 40 percent less power than the
Pentium processor.
Microsoft and Mozilla release new 
versions of their respective Web
browsers. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer
7 and Mozilla’s Firefox 2 offer easier
browsing through the use of tabs and
allow search capabilities directly from
the toolbar. They also offer enhanced
security features to protect from
phishing and to help defend against
malware.

Timeline 
Microsoft releases the latest version of its
flagship Office suite. New features include the
most significant update to the user interface in
more than a decade, including the introduction of
the Ribbon, which replaces the toolbars in most
of the programs,
and the capability to
save documents in
XML and PDF
formats.
Microsoft ships the latest version of its widely used
operating system, Windows Vista. Windows Vista
focuses on greatly improving security, deployment,
manageability, and performance. Vista offers a
Basic interface and the Aero interface, which 
offers several graphic features including
transparent windows. Internet Explorer 7
is included with Windows Vista.
Intel introduces Core 2 Quad, a four-core processor
made for dual-processor servers and desktop
computers. The larger number of cores allows for
more energy-efficient performance and optimizes
battery performance in notebook computers. 
Apple introduces the iPhone and sells 270,000 phones in the
first two days. iPhone uses iTouch technology that allows you
to make a call simply by tapping a name or number in your
address book. It also stores and plays music like an iPod.
Apple sells its one billionth song on iTunes.
VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)
providers expand usage to include 
Wi-Fi phones. The phones enable
high-quality service through a
Wireless-G network and high-speed
Internet connection.
Blu-ray and HD DVD
increase in popularity.
While a Blu-ray Disc
(BD) can hold more data than an HD DVD disc,
the HD DVD players are much less expensive
and still have enough capacity to hold a high-
definition movie. A Blu-ray Disc can store about
9 hours of high-definition (HD) video on a 50
GB disc and about 23 hours of standard-
definition (SD) video. HD DVD capacity is
limited to a maximum of 45 GB.
As the popularity of YouTube has grown, 
so have video blogs, or vlogs. Vlogs allow
users to video their message instead of
entering text via a regular blog. The growth
in the popularity of vlogs can be attributed 
to several factors, including the use of
video portable media players. Podcasting
also has increased in popularity for the
same reasons. A podcast is distinguished
from other digital audio formats by its
capability to be downloaded automatically.
2007
Apple releases its Mac OS X version
10.5 “Leopard” operating system,
available in a desktop version and
server version. The system includes 
a significantly revised desktop, with a
semitransparent menu bar and an updated search
tool that incorporates the same visual navigation
interface as iTunes. Other features include an auto-
mated backup utility and the capability to perform
searches across multiple computers.
Half of the world’s population
uses cell phones. More and
more people are using a cell
phone in lieu of a landline in
their home. Although some
studies predict that 37 percent of Americans
will use their cell phone as their sole telephone,
a major concern is their use for 911 calls. Only
58 percent of U.S. emergency dispatch centers
have the technology to track cell phone calls.

decreasing notebook computer prices have
businesses as well as individuals rapidly
replacing desktop computers with more
mobile notebook computers.
2008
Online social networks continue to grow in
popularity, with MySpace and Facebook being
the most widely used. Combined social net-
working Web sites total almost 1 billion users,
with MySpace and Facebook alone boasting
more than 360 million users. YouTube continues
to gain users. In 2008, presidential candidates
use the popular video sharing Web site as an
outlet for promoting their candidacies. The
number of blogs has grown to more than 100
million.
Bill Gates announces his retirement from
Microsoft. He will continue as chairman
and advisor on key development projects.
Gates plans to devote more time to the
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and its
work on global health and education. 
Nintendo Wii becomes a leader in
game consoles and is being used
in revolutionary ways, such as
training surgeons. Studies show
that surgeons who play the video game for 3 hours a
week make 37 percent fewer mistakes on laparoscopic
surgery and perform the surgery 27 percent faster.
In February 2009,
federal law will require that all full-power television
stations broadcast only in digital format. Analog
television owners will be required to purchase a
converter box to view over-the-air digital program-
ming. Between January 2008 and March 2009, all
U.S. households can request up to two coupons,
worth $40 each, to be used toward the purchase of
digital-to-analog converter boxes. Analog televisions
connected to a paid provider such as cable or satel-
lite television service will not need an additional
converter box.
The Versatile Multilayer
Disc (HD VMD) is introduced and is
intended to compete with HD DVD and
Blu-ray Disc. The HD VMD has a capacity
of 30 GB per side. Players are available
for as low as $150, and some have USB
ports for connection to external storage
devices.
Microsoft introduces Windows Server
2008, the successor to Windows Server
2003. Along with most of the new
Windows Vista features, Windows Server
2008 includes an installation variation
called Server Core, a scaled-down
installation in which no Windows Explorer
shell is installed and all configuration and
maintenance is accomplished entirely 
through command-line interface windows.
WiMAX goes live! The advantage of this
technology is the capability to access video,
music, voice, and video calls wherever and
whenever desired. Average download speeds 
are between 2 Mbps and 4 Mbps. By year’s end,
Sprint anticipates 100 million users on its
network.

THE INTERNET
O
ne of the major reasons business, home, and other users purchase computers is for Internet
access. The Internet, also called the Net, is a worldwide collection of networks that links
millions of businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and individuals. The
Internet is a widely used research tool, providing society with access to global information and instant
communications.
Today, more than one billion users around the world access a variety of services on the Internet,
some of which are shown in Figure 2-1. The World Wide Web and e-mail are two of the more widely
used Internet services. Other services include chat rooms, instant messaging, and VoIP (Voice over
Internet Protocol). This chapter discusses each of these Internet services.
The Internet has its roots in a networking project started by an agency of the U.S. Department of
Defense. The goal was to build a network that (1) allowed scientists at different locations to share infor-
mation and work together on military and scientific projects and (2) could function even if part of the net-
work were disabled or destroyed by a disaster such as a nuclear attack. That network, called ARPANET,
became functional in September 1969, linking scientific and academic researchers across the United States.
The original network consisted of four main computers, one each located at the University of
California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Stanford Research
Institute, and the University of Utah. Each computer served as a host on the network. A host or
server is any computer that provides services and connections to other computers on a network. 
By 1984, the network had more than 1,000 individual computers linked as hosts. Today, more than
500 million hosts connect to this network, which became known as the Internet.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS
The Internet consists of many local, regional, national, and international networks. Both public
and private organizations own networks on the Internet. These networks, along with telephone
companies, cable and satellite companies, and the government, all contribute toward the internal
structure of the Internet. 
Each organization on the Internet is responsible only for maintaining its own network. No single
person, company, institution, or government agency controls or owns the Internet. The World Wide
Web Consortium (W3C), however, oversees research and sets standards and guidelines for many
areas of the Internet. Nearly 400 organizations from around the world are members of the W3C.
HOW THE INTERNET WORKS
Data sent over the Internet travels via networks and communications media owned and operated
by many companies. The following sections present various ways to connect to these networks on
the Internet.
Connecting to the Internet
Employees and students often connect to the Internet through a business or school network.
Some homes and small businesses use dial-up access to connect to the Internet. Dial-up access
takes place when the modem in your computer uses a standard telephone line to connect to the
Internet. A dial-up connection, however, is slow-speed technology.

Many home and small business users opt for higher-speed Internet connections. DSL (digital
subscriber line) is a technology that provides high-speed Internet connections using regular tele-
phone lines. A cable modem allows access to high-speed Internet services through the cable televi-
sion network. Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) uses fiber-optic cable to provide high-speed Internet
access to home and business users. Fixed wireless high-speed Internet connections use a dish-
shaped antenna on your house or business to communicate with a tower location
via radio signals. A Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) network uses radio signals to provide
Internet connections to wireless computers and devices. A wireless modem allows
access to the Internet through a cellular network. A satellite modem communicates
with a satellite dish to provide high-speed Internet connections via satellite.
In most cases, higher-speed connections are always on, that is, connected to the
Internet the entire time the computer is running. With dial-up access, by contrast,
you must establish the connection to the Internet. 
Mobile users access the Internet using a variety of technologies. Most hotels and 
airports provide Internet connections. Wireless Internet access technologies, such as
through Wi-Fi networks, allow mobile users to connect easily to the Internet with
notebook computers, Tablet PCs, smart phones, and other personal mobile devices
while away from a telephone, cable, or other wired connection. Home users often
set up a Wi-Fi network. Many public locations, such as airports, hotels, schools,
and coffee shops, are hot spots that provide Wi-Fi Internet connections to users
with mobile computers or devices.
Access Providers
An access provider is a business that provides individuals and companies access to the Internet
free or for a fee. For example, some Wi-Fi networks provide free access while others charge a per
use fee. Other access providers often charge a fixed amount for an Internet connection, usually
about $5 to $22 per month for dial-up access and $13 to $200 for higher-speed access.
Users access the Internet through ISPs, online service providers, and wireless Internet service
providers. An ISP (Internet service provider) is a regional or national access provider. A regional
ISP usually provides Internet access to a specific geographic area. A national ISP is a business that
provides Internet access in cities and towns nationwide. National ISPs usually offer more services
and have a larger technical support staff than regional ISPs. Examples of national ISPs are AT&T
Worldnet Service and EarthLink.
In addition to providing Internet access, an online service provider (OSP) also has many 
members-only features. These features include special content and services such as news,
weather, legal information, financial data, hardware and software guides, games, travel guides, 
e-mail, photo communities, online calendars, and instant messaging. The fees for using an OSP
sometimes are slightly higher than fees for an ISP. The two more popular OSPs are AOL (America
Online) and MSN (Microsoft Network). AOL also provides free access to its services to any user
with a high-speed Internet connection.
A wireless Internet service provider (WISP) is a company that provides wireless Internet
access to computers and mobile devices, such as smart phones and PDAs, with built-in wireless
capability (such as Wi-Fi) or to computers using wireless modems or wireless access devices.
Wireless modems usually are in the form of a card that inserts in a slot in a computer or mobile
device. Examples of wireless Internet service providers include AT&T, Boingo Wireless, Sprint
Broadband Direct, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless.
How Data Travels the Internet
Computers connected to the Internet work together to transfer data and information around 
the world. Several main transmission media carry the heaviest amount of traffic on the Internet.
These major carriers of network traffic are known collectively as the Internet backbone.
In the United States, the transmission media that make up the Internet backbone exchange data
at several different major cities across the country. That is, they transfer data from one network to
another until it reaches its final destination (Figure 2-2).

Free Wi-Fi is growing in popularity.
In addition to being able to access
free Wi-Fi in public locations such
as fast food restaurants and coffee
shops, some cities also are offering
Wi-Fi free-of-charge to residents
and guests. For this reason, resi-
dents of these cities no longer need
to pay for Internet access. For more

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS
Step 1:
You initiate an action to 
request data from the 
Internet. For example, 
you request to display 
a Web page on your 
computer screen.
Step 2:
A cable modem 
transfers the 
computer’s digital 
signals to the cable 
television line in 
your house.
Step 3:
Your request (digital signals) travels 
through cable television lines to a 
central cable 
system, which 
is shared by 
up to 500 
homes in a 
neighborhood.
Step 4:
The central cable system sends 
your request over high-speed 
fiber-optic lines to the cable 
operator, who often 
also is the ISP.
Step 5:
The ISP routes your request through the 
Internet backbone to the destination server 
(in this example, the server that contains 
the requested Web site).
Step 6:
The server retrieves the requested 
Web page and sends it back through 
the Internet backbone to your computer.
FIGURE 2-2
HOW A HOME USER’S DATA MIGHT TRAVEL THE INTERNET USING A CABLE MODEM CONNECTION
Internet Addresses
The Internet relies on an addressing system much like the postal service to send data to a 
computer at a specific destination. An IP address, short for Internet Protocol address, is a number
that uniquely identifies each computer or device connected to the Internet. The IP address usually
consists of four groups of numbers, each separated by a period. In general, the first portion of each
IP address identifies the network and the last portion identifies the specific computer.
These all-numeric IP addresses are difficult to remember and use. Thus, the Internet supports
the use of a text name that represents one or more IP addresses. A domain name is the text ver-
sion of an IP address. Figure 2-3 shows an IP address and its associated domain name. As with an
IP address, the components of a domain name
are separated by periods.
The text in the domain name up to the first
period identifies the type of Internet server. The
www in Figure 2-3, for example, indicates a
Web server. The Internet server portion of a
domain name often is not required.

EXAMPLES OF GENERIC TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS
Every domain name contains a top-level
domain (TLD), which is the last section of 
the domain name. A generic TLD (gTLD),
such as the com in Figure 2-3 on the previous
page, identifies the type of organization asso-
ciated with the domain. Figure 2-4 lists some
generic TLDs. For international Web sites out-
side the United States, the domain name also
includes a country code TLD (ccTLD), which
is a two-letter country code, such as au for
Australia or fr for France.
When you specify a domain name, a server
translates the domain name into its associated
IP address so that data can be routed to the
correct computer. This server is an Internet
server that usually is associated with an
Internet access provider.
THE WORLD WIDE WEB
The World Wide Web (WWW), or Web, a widely
used service on the Internet, consists of a world-
wide collection of electronic documents. Each
electronic document on the Web, called a Web
page, can contain text, graphics, audio, and
video. Additionally, Web pages usually have
built-in connections to other documents. A Web
site is a collection of related Web pages and asso-
ciated items, such as documents and pictures,
stored on a Web server. A Web server is a com-
puter that delivers requested Web pages to your
computer. Some industry experts use the term
Web 2.0 to refer to Web sites that allow users to
modify Web site content, provide a means for
users to share personal information (such as
social networking Web sites), and have applica-
tion software built into the site for visitors to use
(such as e-mail and word processing programs).
Browsing the Web
A Web browser, or browser, is application
software that allows users to access and view
Web pages. To browse the Web, you need a com-
puter that is connected to the Internet and that
has a Web browser. The more widely used Web
browsers for personal computers are Internet
Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.
QUIZ YOURSELF 2-1
C6672_CH02_pp5.qxd  1/30/08  1:24 PM  Page 54

With an Internet connection established, you start a Web browser. The browser retrieves and
displays a starting Web page, sometimes called the browser’s home page. Figure 2-5 shows how 
a Web browser displays a home page.
The more common usage of the term, home page, refers to the first page that a Web site displays.
Similar to a book cover or a table of contents for a Web site, the home page provides information
about the Web site’s purpose and content. Often it provides connections to other documents, Web
pages, or Web sites, which can be downloaded to a computer or mobile device. Downloading is
the process of a computer receiving information, such as a Web page, from a server on the
Internet.

Step 3: 
The Web browser communicates with a server 
maintained by your Internet access provider. 
The server translates the domain name of the 
home page to an IP address and then sends 
the IP address to your computer.
Step 4: 
The Web browser uses the IP address to contact the
Web server associated with the home page and then
requests the home page from the server. The Web 
server sends the home page to the Web browser, which
formats the page for display on your screen.

Web Addresses
A Web page has a unique address, which is called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
or Web address. For example, the home page for the United States Postal Service Web
site has a Web address of http://www.usps.com. A Web browser retrieves a Web page
using its Web address.
If you know the Web address of a Web page, you can type it in the Address bar at the 
top of the browser window. If you type http://www.usps.com/household/stampcollecting/
welcome.htm as the Web address in the Address bar and then press the ENTER key, the
browser downloads and displays the Web page shown in Figure 2-6.
A Web address consists of a protocol, domain name, and sometimes the path to a specific
Web page or location on a Web page. Many Web page addresses begin with http://. The
http, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a set of rules that defines how pages
transfer on the Internet.
To help minimize errors, many browsers and Web sites do not require you enter the
http:// and www portions of the Web address.
When you enter the Web address, http://www.usps.com/household/stampcollecting/
welcome.htm in the Web browser, it sends a request to the Web server that contains the
usps.com Web site. The server then retrieves the Web page that is named welcome.htm in
the household/stampcollecting path and delivers it to your browser, which then displays
the Web page on the screen.
For information about useful Web sites and their associated Web addresses, read the
Making Use of the Web feature that follows this chapter.

Navigating Web Pages
Most Web pages contain links. A link, short for hyperlink, is a built-in connection to another
related Web page or part of a Web page. Links allow you to obtain information in a nonlinear way.
That is, instead of accessing topics in a specified order, you move directly to a topic of interest.
Branching from one related topic to another in a nonlinear fashion is what makes links so
powerful. Some people use the phrase, surfing the Web, to refer to the activity of using links to
explore the Web. 
On the Web, a link can be text or an image. Text links may be underlined and/or displayed in
a color different from other text on the Web page. Pointing to, or positioning the pointer on, a
link on the screen typically changes the shape of the pointer to a small hand with a pointing
index finger. Pointing to a link also sometimes causes the link to change in appearance. The Web
page shown in Figure 2-7 contains a variety of link types, with the pointer on one of the links.
Each link on a Web page corresponds to a Web address or document. To activate a link, you
click it, that is, point to the
link and then press the left
mouse button. Clicking a link
causes the Web page or docu-
ment associated with the link
to be displayed on the screen.
The linked object might be on
the same Web page, a different
Web page at the same Web
site, or a separate Web page at
a different Web site in another
city or country. Many current
Web browsers support tabbed
browsing, where the top of the
browser displays a tab (similar
to a file folder tab) for each
Web page you open. To move
from one open Web page to
another, you click the tab in
the Web browser. Read
Looking Ahead 2-1 for a 
look at the next generation 
of Web surfing.

Internet Speeds into the Future
High-quality video conferencing and video-streaming technologies are among the new
opportunities the Internet2 will bring to students, educators, and researchers across
the globe.
The not-for-profit Internet2 project connects more than 206 educational and 60
research institutions via a high-speed private network. When used solely as a research
tool, Internet2 applications process massive amounts of data, such as linking observa-
tories atop Hawaii’s tallest mountains and video conferences from 20 remote sites
across the world.
By 2020, the Internet2 will allow Web surfers to access more than 250 million
Web sites at speeds perhaps 10,000 times faster than today’s Internet. Schools have used the Internet2 for
interactive video conferences linking authors with readers, music composers with conductors, and operating
room doctors with medical students. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch2/looking and then click

Searching for Information on the Web
The Web is a global resource of information. A primary use of the Web is to conduct research by
searching for specific information, including text, graphics, audio, and video. The first step in suc-
cessful searching is to identify the main idea or concept in the topic about which you are seeking
information. Determine any synonyms, alternate spellings, or variant word forms for the topic.
Then, use a search tool to locate the information.
Two types of search tools are search engines and subject directories. A search engine is a program
that finds Web sites, Web pages, images, videos, news, and other information related to a specific
topic. A subject directory classifies Web pages in an organized set of categories or groups, such as
sports or shopping, and related subcategories.
Some Web sites offer the functionality of both a search engine and a subject directory. Google and
Yahoo!, for example, are widely used search engines that also provide a subject directory. To use
Google or Yahoo!, you enter the Web address (google.com or yahoo.com) in the Address bar in a
browser window. The table in Figure 2-8 lists the Web addresses of several popular general-purpose
search engines and subject directories.

SEARCH ENGINES
A search engine is particularly helpful in locating Web pages about certain
topics or in locating specific Web pages, images, videos, news, and other information for which
you do not know the exact Web address. Some search engines look through Web pages for all
types of information. Others can restrict their searches to a specific type of information, such as
images, videos, audio, news, maps, people or businesses, and blogs.
Search engines require that you enter a word or phrase, called search text, that describe the
item you want to find. Figure 2-9 shows how to use the Google search engine to search for the
phrase, Michigan golf courses. The results shown in Step 3 include more than two million links to
Web pages, called hits, that reference Michigan golf courses. Each hit in the list has a link that, when
clicked, displays an associated Web site or Web page. Most search engines sequence the hits based
on how close the words in the search text are to one another in the titles and descriptions of the hits.
Thus, the first few links probably contain more relevant information.
C6672_CH02_pp5.qxd  1/30/08  1:24 PM  Page 58

If you enter a phrase with spaces between the words in the search text, most search engines 
display results (hits) that include all of the words. Techniques you can use to improve your searches
include the following:
• Use specific nouns and put the most important terms first in the search text.
• Use the asterisk (*) to substitute characters in words. For example, retriev* returns retrieves,
retrieval, retriever, and any other variation.
• Use quotation marks to create phrases so the search engine finds the exact sequence of words.
• List all possible spellings, for example, email, e-mail.
• Before using a search engine, read its Help information.
• If the search is unsuccessful with one search engine, try another.

Types of Web Sites
Twelve types of Web sites are portal, news, informational, business/marketing, educational,
entertainment, advocacy, blog, wiki, online social network, content aggregator, and personal.
Many Web sites fall into more than one of these categories.
PORTAL
A portal is a Web site that offers a variety of Internet services from a single, convenient
location (Figure 2-11a). Most portals offer the following free services: search engine and/or subject
directory; news; sports and weather; Web publishing; reference tools
such as yellow pages, stock quotes, and maps; shopping; and e-mail
and other forms of online communications. Popular portals include
AltaVista, AOL, Excite, GO.com, iGoogle, LookSmart, Lycos, MSN,
Netscape, and Yahoo!.
NEWS
A news Web site contains newsworthy material including
stories and articles relating to current events, life, money, sports, 
and the weather (Figure 2-11b). Newspapers 
and television and radio stations are some of 
the media that maintain news Web sites.
INFORMATIONAL
An informational Web site
contains factual information (Figure 2-11c). Many
United States government agencies have informa-
tional Web sites providing information such as
census data, tax codes, and the congressional
budget. Other organizations provide information
such as public transportation schedules and
published research findings.
BUSINESS/MARKETING
A business/marketing 
Web site contains content that promotes or sells
products or services (Figure 2-11d). Nearly every 
business has a business/marketing Web site. 
Many companies also allow you to purchase 
their products or services online.
EDUCATIONAL
An educational Web site offers
exciting, challenging avenues for formal and
informal teaching and learning
(Figure 2-11e). For a more
structured learning experience,
companies provide online
training to employees; and col-
leges offer online classes and
degrees. Instructors often use
the Web to enhance classroom
teaching by publishing course
materials, grades, and other
pertinent class information.

C6672_CH02_pp5.qxd  1/30/08  1:24 PM  Page 61

ENTERTAINMENT
An entertainment Web site
offers an interactive and engaging environment
(Figure 2-11f). Popular entertainment Web sites
offer music, videos, sports, games, ongoing Web
episodes, sweepstakes, chats, and more.
ADVOCACY
An advocacy Web site contains
content that describes a cause, opinion, or idea
(Figure 2-11g). These Web sites usually present
views of a particular group or association.
BLOG
A blog, short for Weblog, is an informal
Web site consisting of time-stamped articles, or
posts, in a diary or journal format, usually listed
in reverse chronological order (Figure 2-11h). A
blog that contains video clips is called a video
blog or vlog. The term blogosphere refers to 
the worldwide collection of blogs, and the
vlogosphere refers to all vlogs worldwide. Blogs
reflect the interests, opinions, and personalities of
the author and sometimes site visitors. Blogs
have become an important means of worldwide
communications.
WIKI
A wiki is a collaborative Web site that
allows users to create, add to, modify, or delete
the Web site content via their Web browser.
Most wikis are open to modification by the
general public. Wikis usually collect recent
edits on a Web page so that someone can
review them for accuracy. The difference
between a wiki and a blog is that users cannot
modify original posts made by the blogger. A
popular wiki is Wikipedia, a free Web encyclo-
pedia (Figure 2-11i). Read Ethics & Issues 2-1
for a related discussion.
ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS
An online social
network, also called a social networking Web
site, is a Web site that encourages members in
its online community to share their interests,
ideas, stories, photos, music, and videos with
other registered users (Figure 2-11j). Popular
social networking Web sites include Facebook
and MySpace, which alone has more than 28
million visitors each day. A media sharing Web
site is a specific type of online social network
that enables members to share media such as
photos, music, and videos. Flickr, Fotki, and
Webshots are popular photo sharing communi-
ties; Eyespot, Google Video, and YouTube are
popular video sharing communities.

CONTENT AGGREGATOR
A content
aggregator is a business that gathers and
organizes Web content and then distrib-
utes, or feeds, the content to subscribers for
free or a fee (Figure 2-11k). Examples of
distributed content include news, music,
video, and pictures. Subscribers select con-
tent in which they are interested. Whenever
this content changes, it is downloaded
automatically (pushed) to the subscriber’s
computer or mobile device. RSS 2.0, which
stands for Really Simple Syndication, is a
specification that content aggregators use
to distribute content to subscribers.
PERSONAL
A private individual or family not
usually associated with any organization may
maintain a personal Web site (Figure 2-11l).
People publish personal Web pages for a vari-
ety of reasons. Some are job hunting. Others
simply want to share life experiences with 
the world.
Evaluating a Web Site
Do not assume
that information
presented on the
Web is correct or
accurate. Any per-
son, company, or
organization can
publish a Web page
on the Internet. No
one oversees the
content of these Web
pages. Figure 2-12
lists guidelines for
assessing the value
of a Web site or Web
page before relying
on its content.

GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING THE VALUE OF A WEB SITE
Evaluation 
Criteria
Reliable Web Sites
Affiliation
A reputable institution should support the Web site without bias in the
information.
Audience
The Web site should be written at an appropriate level.
Authority
The Web site should list the author and the appropriate credentials.
Content
The Web site should be well organized and the links should work.
Currency
The information on the Web page should be current.
Design
The pages at the Web site should download quickly and be visually pleasing
and easy to navigate.
Objectivity
The Web site should contain little advertising and be free of preconceptions.

Should You Trust a Wiki for Academic Research?
As wikis have grown in number, size, and popularity, some educators and librarians have shunned the sites as valid sources of research. While
many wikis are tightly controlled with a limited number of contributors and expert editors, these usually focus on narrowly-defined, specialized
topics. Large online wikis, such as Wikipedia, often involve thousands of editors, many of whom remain anonymous. Recently, television station
reporters purposefully vandalized entries on Wikipedia for John Lennon and Elvis Presley in an attempt to either discredit Wikipedia or to test
how quickly corrections are made. Editors quickly corrected the information. In other situations, rival political factions falsified or embellished
wiki entries in an attempt to give their candidate an advantage. Some wiki supporters argue that most wikis provide adequate controls to quickly
correct false or misleading content and to punish those who submit it. Some propose that wikis should be used as a starting point for research-
ing a fact, but that the fact should be verified using traditional sources. Should wikis be allowed as valid sources for academic research? Why or
why not? Would you submit a paper to your instructor that cites a wiki as a source? An encyclopedia? Why or why not? What policies could
wikis enforce that could garner more confidence from the public?

Multimedia on the Web
Most Web pages include more than just formatted text and links. The more exciting Web pages use
multimedia. Multimedia refers to any application that combines text with graphics, animation, audio,
video, and/or virtual reality. The sections that follow discuss how the Web uses these multimedia 
elements.
GRAPHICS
A graphic, or graphical image, is a digital representation of nontext information such as
a drawing, chart, or photo. Many Web pages use colorful graphical designs and images to convey
messages (Figure 2-13).
Of the graphics formats that exist on the Web, the
two more common are JPEG and GIF formats. JPEG
(pronounced JAY-peg) is a format that compresses
graphics to reduce their file size, which means the
file takes up less storage space. The goal with JPEG
graphics is to reach a balance between image quality
and file size. Digital photos often use the JPEG for-
mat. GIF (pronounced jiff) graphics also use com-
pression techniques to reduce file sizes. The GIF
format works best for images that have only a few
distinct colors, such as company logos. 
Some Web sites use thumbnails on their pages
because graphics can be time-consuming to display.
A thumbnail is a small version of a larger graphic.
You usually can click a thumbnail to display a
larger image.
ANIMATION
Many Web pages use animation,
which is the appearance of motion created by 
displaying a series of still images in sequence.
Animation can make Web pages more visually
interesting or draw attention to important
information or links.
AUDIO
On the Web, you can listen to audio clips and live audio. Audio includes music, speech, or any
other sound. Simple applications on the Web consist of individual audio files available for download to
a computer or device. Once downloaded, you can play (listen to) the contents of these files. Audio files
are compressed to reduce their file sizes. For example, the MP3 format reduces an audio file to about
one-tenth its original size, while preserving much of the original quality of the sound. 
Some music publishers have Web sites that allow users to download sample tracks free to persuade
them to buy the entire CD. Other Web sites allow a user to purchase and download an entire CD
(Figure 2-14). It is legal to download copyrighted music only if the song’s copyright holder has
granted permission for users to download and play the song. Copyright issues led to the develop-
ment of digital rights management (DRM), a strategy designed to prevent illegal distribution of
music and other digital content.
To listen to an audio file on your computer, you need special software called a player. Most current
operating systems contain a player. Popular players include iTunes, RealPlayer, and Windows Media
Player.
Some applications on the Web use streaming audio. Streaming is the process of transferring data in 
a continuous and even flow. Streaming allows users to access and use a file while it is transmitting. 
For example, streaming audio enables you to listen to music as it downloads to your computer.
Podcasting is another popular method of distributing audio. A podcast is recorded audio, usually an
MP3 file, stored on a Web site that can be downloaded to a computer or a portable media player such
as an iPod. Examples of podcasts include music, radio shows, news stories, classroom lectures, political
messages, and television commentaries. Podcasters register their podcasts with content aggregators.
Subscribers select podcast feeds they want to be downloaded automatically whenever they connect.

HOW TO PURCHASE AND DOWNLOAD MUSIC
Step 1: 
Display the music 
Web site on the 
screen. Search for, 
select, and pay for 
the music you want 
to purchase from
the music Web site.
Step 2: 
Download the music from the Web site’s server to your 
computer’s hard disk.
Step 3a: 
Listen to the music from your computer’s hard disk.
Step 3b: Download music 
from your computer’s hard 
disk to a portable media 
player. Listen to the music 
through earphones attached
to the portable media player.
VIDEO
On the Web, you can view video clips or watch live video. Video consists of full-motion
images that are played back at various speeds. Most video also has accompanying audio. You can
use the Internet to watch live and prerecorded coverage of your favorite television programs or
enjoy a live performance of your favorite vocalist. You can upload, share, or view video clips at a
video sharing Web site such as YouTube. Educators, politicians, and businesses are using video
blogs and video podcasts to engage students, voters, and consumers.
Video files often are compressed because they are quite large in size. These clips also are quite
short in length, usually less than 10 minutes, because they can take a long time to download. The
Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) defines a popular video compression standard, a widely
used one called MPEG-4 or MP4. As with streaming audio, streaming video allows you to view
longer or live video images as they download to your computer.
VIRTUAL REALITY
Virtual reality (VR) is the use of computers to simulate a real or imagined
environment that appears as a three-dimensional (3-D) space. VR involves the display of 3-D
images that users explore and manipulate interactively. A VR Web site, for example, might show
a room with furniture. Users walk through such a VR room by moving an input device forward,
backward, or to the side.

PLUG-INS
Most Web browsers have the capability of displaying basic multimedia elements 
on a Web page. Sometimes, a browser might need an additional program, called a plug-in. A
plug-in, or add-on, is a program that extends the capability of a browser. You can download
many plug-ins at no cost from various Web sites (Figure 2-15).

Web Publishing
Before the World Wide Web, the means to share opinions and ideas with others easily and 
inexpensively was limited to the media, classroom, work, or social environments.  Today, businesses
and individuals convey information to millions of people by creating their own Web pages.
Web publishing is the development and maintenance of Web pages. To develop a Web page, you
do not have to be a computer programmer. For the small business or home user, Web publishing is
fairly easy as long as you have the proper tools.
The five major steps to Web publishing are as follows:
1. Plan a Web site 
2. Analyze and design a Web site
3. Create a Web site
4. Deploy a Web site
5. Maintain a Web site
Figure 2-16 illustrates these steps with respect to a personal Web site.

THE WORLD WIDE WEB
E-Commerce
E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, is a business transaction that occurs over an 
electronic network such as the Internet. Anyone with access to a computer, an Internet connection,
and a means to pay for purchased goods or services can participate in e-commerce.
Three types of e-commerce are business-to-consumer, consumer-to-consumer, and business-
to-business. Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce consists of the sale of goods and services to
the general public. For example, Dell has a B2C Web site. Instead of visiting a computer store to
purchase a computer, customers can order one directly from the Dell Web site.
Step 1: 
Plan a Web site.
Think about issues that could
affect the design of the Web site.
Step 2: 
Analyze and design a Web site. Design the layout of 
the elements of the Web site.
Step 3: 
Create a Web site. Use word processing software or Web page 
authoring software to create the Web site.
Step 4: 
Deploy a Web site. Save the Web site on a Web server.
Step 5: 
Maintain a Web site. 
Visit your Web site
regularly to be sure it
is working and current.
FIGURE 2-16
HOW TO PUBLISH YOUR RESUME ON THE WEB
C6672_CH02_pp5.qxd  1/30/08  1:24 PM  Page 67

A customer (consumer) visits an online business through an electronic storefront, which contains
product descriptions, images, and a shopping cart (Figure 2-17). The shopping cart allows the cus-
tomer to collect purchases. When ready to complete the sale, the customer enters personal data and
the method of payment, preferably through a secure Internet connection.
Instead of purchasing from a business, consumers can purchase from each other. For example,
with an online auction, users bid on an item being sold by someone else. The highest bidder at the
end of the bidding period purchases the item. Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce occurs
when one consumer sells directly to another, such as in an online auction. eBay is one of the more
popular online auction Web sites.
Most e-commerce, though, actually takes place between businesses, which is called business-to-
business (B2B) e-commerce. Many businesses provide goods and services to other businesses, such
as online advertising, recruiting, credit, sales, market research, technical support, and training.
As an alternative to entering credit card, bank account, or other financial information online, some
shopping and auction Web sites allow consumers to use an online payment service such as PayPal
or Google Checkout. To use an online payment service, you create an account that is linked to your
credit card or funds at a financial institution. When you make a purchase, you use your online pay-
ment service account, which transfers money for you without revealing your financial information.

OTHER INTERNET SERVICES
The Web is only one of the many services on the Internet. The Web and other Internet services have
changed the way we communicate. We can send e-mail messages to the president, have a discus-
sion with experts about the stock market, chat with someone in another country about genealogy,
and talk about homework assignments with classmates via instant messages. Many times, these
communications take place completely in writing — without the parties ever meeting each other. 
At home, work, and school, people use computers and Internet-enabled mobile devices so that
they always have instant access to e-mail, mailing lists, instant messaging, chat rooms, VoIP (Voice
over IP), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and newsgroups and message boards. The following pages
discuss each of these Internet services.

E-Mail
E-mail (short for electronic mail) is the transmission of messages and files via a computer network.
Today, e-mail is a primary communications method for both personal and business use.
You use an e-mail program to create, send, receive, forward, store, print, and delete e-mail 
messages. Outlook and Windows Mail are two popular e-mail programs. The steps in Figure 
2-18 illustrate how to send an e-mail message using Outlook. The message can be simple text or can
include an attachment such as a word processing document, a graphic, an audio clip, or a video clip.

Internet access providers typically supply an e-mail program as a standard part of their Internet
access services. To use these Web-based e-mail programs, you connect to the Web site and set up an 
e-mail account, which typically includes an e-mail address and a password.
Just as you address a letter when using the postal system, you must address an e-mail message
with the e-mail address of your intended recipient. Likewise, when someone sends you a message,
he or she must have your e-mail address. An e-mail address is a combination of a user name and 
a domain name that identifies a user so that he or she can receive Internet e-mail (Figure 2-19). A
user name is a unique combination of characters, such as letters of the
alphabet and/or numbers, that identifies a specific user. 
In an Internet e-mail address, an @ (pronounced at) symbol separates
the user name from the domain name. Your service provider supplies 
the domain name. Using the example in Figure 2-19, a possible e-mail
address for Carly Martinez would be carlymartinez@scsite.com, which
would be read as follows: Carly Martinez at s c site dot com. Most e-mail programs allow you to create
an address book, or contacts folder, which contains a list of names and e-mail addresses.
When you send an e-mail message, an outgoing mail server that is operated by your Internet access
provider determines how to route the message through the Internet and then sends the message. As you
receive e-mail messages, an incoming mail server — also operated by your Internet access provider —
holds the messages in your mailbox until you use your e-mail program to retrieve them. Most e-mail
programs have a mail notification alert that informs you via a message and/or sound when you receive
new mail. Figure 2-20 illustrates how an e-mail message may travel from a sender to a receiver.

Can my computer get a virus through e-mail?
Yes. A virus is a computer program that can damage files and the operating system. One way that virus authors
attempt to spread a virus is by sending virus-infected e-mail attachments. If you receive an e-mail attachment,
you should use an antivirus program to verify that it is virus free.

Mailing Lists
A mailing list is a group of e-mail names and addresses given a single name. When a message
is sent to a mailing list, every person on the list receives a copy of the message in his or her mail-
box. To add your e-mail name and address to a mailing list, you subscribe to it. To remove your
name, you unsubscribe from the mailing list.
Thousands of mailing lists exist about a variety of topics in areas of entertainment, business, 
computers, society, culture, health, recreation, and education. To locate a mailing list dealing with
a particular topic, you can search for the search text, mailing list, in a search engine.
Instant Messaging
Instant messaging (IM) is a real-time Internet communications service that notifies you when one
or more people are online and then allows you to exchange messages or files or join a private chat
room with them (Figure 2-21). Some IM services support voice and video conversations. For IM to
work, both parties must be online at the same time. Also, the receiver of a message must be willing
to accept messages. 
To use IM, you may have to install instant messenger software on the computer or device, 
such as a smart phone, you plan to use. Some operating systems, such as Windows Vista, include 
an instant messenger. No standards currently exist for IM. To ensure successful communications,
all individuals on the contact list need to use the same or a compatible instant messenger.

Chat Rooms
A chat is a real-time typed conversation that takes place on a computer. Real time means that
you and the people with whom you are conversing are online at the same time. A chat room is a
location on an Internet server that permits users to chat with each other. Anyone in the chat room
can participate in the conversation, which usually is specific to a particular topic.

As you type on your keyboard, a line of characters and symbols is displayed on the computer
screen. Others connected to the same chat room server also
see what you type (Figure 2-22). Some chat rooms
support voice chats and video chats, in which
people hear or see each other as they chat.
To start a chat session, you connect to a
chat server through a program called a
chat client. Today’s browsers usually
include a chat client. If yours does not,
you can download a chat client from
the Web. Once you have installed a
chat client, you can create or join a
conversation on the chat server to
which you are connected. 
Have you heard?
FIGURE 2-22
As you type, the words and
symbols you enter are displayed on the computer
screens of other people in the same chat room.
VoIP
VoIP (Voice over IP, or Internet Protocol), also called Internet telephony, enables users to speak to
other users over the Internet (instead of the public switched telephone network).
To place an Internet telephone call, you need a high-speed Internet connection (e.g., via cable or
DSL modem); Internet telephone service; a microphone or telephone, depending on the Internet
telephone service; and Internet telephone soft-
ware or a telephone adapter, depending on the
Internet telephone service (Figure 2-23). Calls to
other parties with the same Internet telephone
service often are free, while calls that connect to
the telephone network typically cost about $15
to $25 per month.
FTP
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is an Internet
standard that permits the process of file upload-
ing and downloading (transferring) with other
computers on the Internet. Uploading is the
opposite of downloading; that is, uploading is
the process of transferring documents, graphics,
and other objects from your computer to a
server on the Internet. 
Many operating systems include FTP
capabilities. An FTP site is a collection of files
including text, graphics, audio clips, video
clips, and program files that reside on an FTP
server. Many FTP sites have anonymous FTP,
whereby anyone can transfer some, if not all,
available files. Some FTP sites restrict file
transfers to those who have authorized
accounts (user names and passwords) on 
the FTP server.

Newsgroups and Message Boards
A newsgroup is an online area in which
users have written discussions about a particu-
lar subject (Figure 2-24). To participate in a dis-
cussion, a user sends a message to the news-
group, and other users in the newsgroup read
and reply to the message. Some major news-
group topic areas include news, recreation,
society, business, science, and computers.
Some newsgroups require you to enter a
user name and password to participate in
the discussion. For example, a newsgroup
for students taking a college course may
require a user name and password to access
the newsgroup. This ensures that only stu-
dents in the course participate in the discus-
sion. To participate in a newsgroup, typically
you use a program called a newsreader.
A popular Web-based type of discussion
group that does not require a newsreader is
a message board. Many Web sites use mes-
sage boards instead of newsgroups because
they are easier to use.
NETIQUETTE
Netiquette, which is short for Internet etiquette, is the code of acceptable behaviors users should
follow while on the Internet; that is, it is the conduct expected of individuals while online.
Netiquette includes rules for all aspects of the Internet, including the World Wide Web, e-mail,
instant messaging, chat rooms, FTP, and newsgroups and message boards. Figure 2-25 outlines
some of the rules of netiquette.
73
NETIQUETTE
NETIQUETTE
Golden Rule: Treat others as you would like them to treat you.
1. In e-mail, chat rooms, and newsgroups:
• Keep messages brief. Use proper grammar, spelling, and
punctuation.
• Be careful when using sarcasm and humor, as it might be
misinterpreted. 
• Be polite. Avoid offensive language.
• Read the message before you send it.
• Use meaningful subject lines.
• Avoid sending or posting flames, which are abusive or
insulting messages. Do not participate in flame wars, which
are exchanges of flames.
• Avoid sending spam, which is the Internet’s version of junk
mail. Spam is an unsolicited e-mail message or newsgroup
posting sent to many recipients or newsgroups at once. 
• Do not use all capital letters, which is the equivalent of
SHOUTING!
• Use emoticons to express emotion. Popular emoticons include
:) Smile
:\
Undecided
:|
Indifference
:( Frown
:o Surprised
• Use abbreviations and acronyms for phrases:
BTW
by the way
IMHO
in my humble opinion
FYI
for your information
TTFN
ta ta for now
FWIW
for what it’s worth
TYVM
thank you very much
• Clearly identify a spoiler, which is a message that reveals a
solution to a game or ending to a movie or program.
2. Read the FAQ (frequently asked questions), if one exists. Many
newsgroups and Web pages have an FAQ.
3. Do not assume material is accurate or up-to-date. Be forgiving of
other’s mistakes.
4. Never read someone’s private e-mail.

Should Companies Be Able to Track Your Online Habits?
When you visit a Web site that includes an advertisement, someone probably is recording the fact that you visited that Web site and
viewed the advertisement with your browser. Over time, companies that specialize in tracking who views which online advertisements can
amass an enormous amount of information about your online Web surfing habits. This collection of information is considered to be part of
your online profile. One company claims that through the use of advertisements on Web pages, it can track well over one billion Web page
views per day. Through tracking the Web sites a user visits, the products they buy, and the articles they read, a company may attempt to
profile the visitor’s beliefs, associations, and habits. Although a user may think he or she is anonymous while navigating the Web, the
company can attempt through various means to link the user’s true identity with the user’s online profile. The company can sell online pro-
files, with or without the user’s true identity, to other advertisers or organizations. Should organizations be allowed to track your Web surf-
ing habits? Why or why not? Should organizations be allowed to associate your real identity with your online identity and profit from the
information? Should companies give you the option of not being tracked? What are the benefits and dangers of online tracking?
Web Developer
If you are looking for a job working with the latest Internet technology, then Web developer could be the career
for you. A Web developer analyzes, designs, develops, implements, and supports Web applications and func-
tionality. Specialized programming skills required include HTML, JavaScript, Java, Perl, C++, and VBScript.
Developers also need multimedia knowledge, including Photoshop, Flash, and Dreamweaver. Developers must
be aware of emerging technologies, such as Web 2.0 and know how they can be used to enhance a Web
presence. Web 2.0 developers must be able to build event-driven environments, such as RSS feeds.
A Web developer must be able to appreciate a client’s needs, recognize the technologies involved to meet those needs, and explain 
those technologies to the client. For example, if the client is a large corporation seeking to set up an online store, a Web developer must
understand e-commerce and be able to explain requirements, probable costs, and possible outcomes in a way the client can understand.
Educational requirements vary from company to company and can range from a high school education to a four-year degree. Many
companies place heavy emphasis on certifications. Two of the more popular certifications are available through the International
Webmasters Association (IWA) and the World Organization of Webmasters (WOW). A wide salary range exists — from $41,000 to
$80,000 — depending on educational background and location. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch2/careers and then

Google
Popular Search Engine
The founders of Google, the leading Internet search engine, state that their 
mission is to organize the world’s information. Every day, their Web site handles
hundreds of millions of queries for information. In seconds, it can locate specific
phrases and terms on four billion Web pages by using more than 10,000 
connected computers. 
Sergey Brin and Larry Page launched Google in 1998 in a friend’s garage. The
name is derived from “googol,” which is the name of the number 1 followed by 100
zeros. Google announced in 2007 the launch of its universal search system, which
blends information from a variety of separate sources, including video, news, books,
images, and maps, with Web sites to produce a single set of results. For more
information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch2/companies and then click Google.
Yahoo!
Popular Web Portal
Yahoo!, the first navigational portal to the Web, began as a hobby for Jerry Yang 
and David Filo when they were doctoral candidates in electrical engineering at
Stanford University. They started creating and organizing lists of their favorite 
Web sites in 1994. The following year, they shared their creation, named Yahoo!,
with fellow students and then released their product to the Internet community.
Yahoo! is an acronym for Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle. What makes
Yahoo! unique is that staff members build the directory by assuming the role of a
typical Web researcher. As part of Yahoo! Elections 2008, the company cosponsored
the first online-only presidential debates for the Democratic and Republican candi-
dates. The two debates allowed voters to question the candidates directly, participate
in the debate in real time, and determine which candidate gave the best performance.

Tim Berners-Lee
Creator of the World Wide Web
The World Wide Web (WWW) has become one of the more widely used Internet services, and its roots are based on 
Tim Berners-Lee’s work. Berners-Lee is credited with creating the first Web server, browser, and Web addresses.
He developed his ideas in 1989 while working at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland,
and based his work on a program he had written for his own use to track random associations. Today, he works quietly in
academia as director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Queen Elizabeth II bestowed the Order of Merit upon the British-born Lee in 2007. Limited to 24 living members, this
award recognizes distinguished service in science, art, literature, and the armed forces, as well as the promotion of culture.

Meg Whitman
eBay President and CEO
Meg Whitman joined eBay in 1998 and has been instrumental in helping the company become the world’s largest online
marketplace. Before that time, she was an executive for the Keds Division of the Stride Rite Corporation and general 
manager of Hasbro Inc.’s Preschool Division. She then served as president and CEO of Florists Transworld Delivery (FTD).
She credits her success to listening to the loyal eBay community, and she occasionally answers their e-mail messages
personally. She holds degrees in economics from Princeton University and management from the Harvard Business School.
eBay fields hundreds of millions of searches daily for products. In 2007, Whitman broadened eBay’s platform by offering
auctions to Chinese mobile customers and by acquiring ticket reseller StubHub for $310 million. For more information, visit

How Can You Access and Connect to the Internet?
The Internet is a worldwide collection of networks that links millions of businesses, government agencies, educational
institutions, and individuals. Employees and students often connect to the Internet through a business or school network.
Some home and small businesses connect to the Internet with dial-up access, which uses a modem in the computer and a
standard telephone line. Many home and small business users opt for higher-speed connections. DSL provides high-speed
Internet connections using regular copper telephone lines. A cable modem allows access to high-speed Internet services
through the cable television network. Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) uses fiber-optic cable to provide high-speed Internet access.
Fixed wireless high-speed Internet connections use a dish-shaped antenna to communicate via radio signals. Wi-Fi uses radio
signals to provide Internet connections to wireless computers and devices. A wireless modem accesses the Internet through a
cellular network. A satellite modem communicates with a satellite dish to provide high-speed Internet connections. An access
provider is a business that provides access to the Internet free or for a fee. An ISP (Internet service provider) is a regional or
national access provider. An online service provider (OSP) provides Internet access in addition to members-only features. A
wireless Internet service provider (WISP) provides wireless Internet access to computers and mobile devices with built-in
wireless capability (such as Wi-Fi) or to computers using wireless access devices.
How Can You View a Web Page and Search for Information on the Web?
A Web browser, or browser, is application software that allows users to access and view Web pages. When you type a Web
address in the Address bar of a browser window, a computer called a Web server delivers the requested Web page to your
computer. Most Web pages contain links. A link is a built-in connection that, when clicked, displays a related Web page or 
part of a Web page. Two search tools are search engines and subject directories. A search engine finds Web sites, Web pages,
images, videos, news, and other information related to a specific topic. Search engines require search text that describes the
item you want to find. A subject directory classifies Web pages in an organized set of categories or groups.
What Are the Types of Web Sites?
A portal is a Web site that offers a variety of Internet services from a single location. A news Web site contains newsworthy
material. An informational Web site contains factual information. A business/marketing Web site promotes or sells products
or services. An educational Web site offers avenues for teaching and learning. An entertainment Web site offers an interac-
tive and engaging environment. An advocacy Web site describes a cause, opinion, or idea. A blog is an informal Web site
consisting of time-stamped articles, or posts, in a diary or journal format, usually listed in reverse chronological order. A
wiki is a collaborative Web site that allows users to create, add to, modify, or delete the Web site content via their Web
browser. An online social network, or social networking Web site, encourages members to share their interests, ideas, sto-
ries, photos, music, and videos with other registered users. A content aggregator is a business that gathers and organizes
Web content and then distributes, or feeds, the content to subscribers for free or a fee. A personal Web site is maintained by
a private individual or family.
What Are the Steps Required for Web Publishing?
Web publishing is the development and maintenance of Web pages. The five major steps to Web publishing are: (1) plan a
Web site, (2) analyze and design a Web site, (3) create a Web site, (4) deploy a Web site, and (5) maintain a Web site.
What Are the Types of E-Commerce?
E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, is a business transaction that occurs over an electronic network such as 
the Internet. Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce consists of the sale of goods and services to the general public.
Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce occurs when one consumer sells directly to another, such as an online auction.
Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce takes place between businesses that exchange goods and services.

How Do E-Mail, Mailing Lists, Instant Messaging, Chat Rooms, VoIP, FTP, and Newsgroups and Message
Boards Work?
E-mail (short for electronic mail) is the transmission of messages and files via
a computer network. A mailing list is a group of e-mail names and addresses
given a single name, so that everyone on the list receives a message sent to
the list. Instant messaging (IM) is a real-time Internet communications serv-
ice that notifies you when one or more people are online. A chat room is a
location on an Internet server that permits users to chat, or conduct real-time
typed conversations. VoIP (Voice over IP, or Internet Protocol) enables users
to speak to other users over the Internet instead of the public switched tele-
phone network. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is an Internet standard that per-
mits file uploading and downloading with other computers on the Internet.
A newsgroup is an online area in which users have written discussions 
about a particular subject. A message board is a popular Web-based type 
of discussion group that is easier to use than a newsgroup.
What Are the Rules of Netiquette?
Netiquette, which is short for Internet etiquette, is the code of acceptable behaviors users should follow while on the
Internet. Keep messages short. Be polite. Use emoticons. Read the FAQ if one exists. Do not assume material is accurate or
up-to-date, and never read someone’s private e-mail.

Making Use of the Web

nformation literacy is defined as having the practical
skills needed to evaluate information critically from print
and electronic resources and to use this information
accurately in daily life. Locating Web sites may be profitable for
your educational and professional careers, as the resources may
help you research class assignments and make your life more fulfill-
ing and manageable.
Because the World Wide Web does not have an organizational
structure to assist you in locating reliable material, you may need addi-
tional resources to guide you in searching. To help you find useful Web
sites, this Special Feature describes specific information about a vari-
ety of Web pages, and it includes tables of Web addresses so that you
can get started. The material is organized in several areas of interest.
Web Exercises at the end of each category

Rock ’n’ Roll on the Web
Consumers place great significance on buying entertainment
products for fun and recreation. Nearly 10 percent of the United
States’s economy is spent on attending concerts and buying
DVDs, CDs, reading materials, sporting goods, and toys.
Many Web sites supplement our cravings for fun and enter-
tainment. For example, you can see and hear the musicians
inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum
(Figure 1). If you need an update on your favorite reality-based
television program or a preview of an upcoming movie, E!
Online and Entertainment Tonight provide the latest features on
television and movie stars. The Internet Movie Database contains
credits and reviews of more than 849,000 titles.
Watch the surfers riding the waves in Washington and romp
with pandas at the San Diego Zoo. Web cams can display live
video on Web pages, taking armchair travelers across the world
for views of natural attractions, historical monuments, colleges,
and cities. Many Web sites featuring Web cams are listed in the
table in Figure 2.

SEARCH AND YE SHALL FIND
Information on the Web
A recent Web Usability survey conducted by the Nielsen
Norman Group found that 88 percent of people who con-
nect to the Internet use a search engine as their first online
action. Search engines require users to type words and
phrases that characterize the information being sought.
Yahoo! (Figure 3), Google, and AltaVista are some of the
more popular search engines. The key to effective search-
ing on the Web is composing search queries that narrow
the search results and place the most relevant Web sites at
the top of the results list.
Keep up with the latest developments by viewing
online dictionaries and encyclopedias that add to their col-
lections of computer and product terms on a regular basis.
Shopping for a new computer can be a daunting experi-
ence, but many online guides can help you select the com-
ponents that best fit your needs and budget. If you are not
confident in your ability to solve a problem alone, turn to
online technical support. Web sites often provide stream-
ing how-to video lessons, tutorials, and real-time chats
with experienced technicians. Hardware and software
reviews, price comparisons, shareware, technical questions
and answers, and breaking technology news are found on
comprehensive portals. Figure 4 lists popular research 
Web sites.

EXPRESS YOURSELF
Blogosphere Growing Swiftly
Internet users are feeling the need to publish their views,
and they are finding Weblogs, or blogs for short, the ideal
vehicle. The blogosphere began as an easy way for indi-
viduals to express their opinions on the Web. Today, this
communication vehicle has become a powerful tool, for
individuals, groups, and corporations are using blogs to
promote their ideas and advertise their products. It is not
necessary to have a background in Web design to be able 
to post to a blog.
Bloggers generally update their Web sites frequently to
reflect their views. Their posts range from a paragraph to an
entire essay and often contain links to other Web sites. The
more popular blogs discuss politics, lifestyles, and technology.
Individuals easily may set up a blog free or for a fee,
using Web sites such as Blogger (Figure 5), Cooeey, and
TypePad. In addition, online social networks may have a 
built-in blogging feature. Be cautious of the information you

Corporate blogs, such as The GM FastLane Blog, 
discuss all aspects of the company’s products, whereas 
all-encompassing blogs, such as the Metafilter Community
Weblog and others in Figure 6, are designed to keep
general readers entertained and informed.
Blogs are affecting the manner in which people
communicate, and some experts predict they will one day
become our primary method of sharing information.

Making Use of the Web
ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND MEDIA SHARING WEB EXERCISES
Many individuals now use online social networks. Visit two online social networks listed in Figure 7. (If you are
attempting to access an online social network from your classroom and are unable to do so, your school may have
restricted use of social networking Web sites.) Compare and contrast these two sites by performing the following actions and
recording your findings. First, create a profile on each of these sites. If you find a Web site that charges a fee to sign up,
choose another Web site. How easy is the sign-up process? Does either Web site ask for any personal information you are
uncomfortable sharing? If so, what information? Once you sign up, make a list of five of your closest friends, and search for
their profiles on each of these two sites. What site contains more of your friends? Browse each site and make a list of its
features. In your opinion, what site is better? Explain why.
Media sharing Web sites make it extremely easy to share photos and videos with friends, family, and colleagues.
Before choosing an online media sharing Web site to use, you should do some research. Visit two media sharing
Web sites in Figure 7. Is there a fee to post media to these Web sites? If so, how much? Are these Web sites supported
by advertisements? Locate the instructions for posting media to these Web sites. Are the instructions straightforward? Do
these Web sites impose a limit on the number and/or size of media files you can post? Summarize your responses to
these questions in two or three paragraphs.
FIGURE 8 The YouTube Web site features videos about current
events, hobbies, musicians, and political issues.
Online Social Networks and Media
Sharing Web Sites More Popular 
than Ever
Do you ever wonder what your friends are doing? What
about your friends’ friends? The popularity of online social
networks has increased dramatically in recent years. Online

require the full functionality of an online social network, you
might consider a media sharing Web site, which is a type of
online social network. Media sharing Web sites such as
YouTube (Figure 8) and Phanfare allow you to post media,
including photos and videos, for others to view, print, and/or
download. Media sharing Web sites, which may be free or
charge a fee, provide a quick, efficient way to share photos of
your last vacation or videos of your family reunion.

Making Use of the Web
Environment
THE FUTURE OF THE PLANET
Making a Difference for Earth
From the rain forests of Africa to the marine life in the Pacific
Ocean, the fragile ecosystem is under extreme stress. Many
environmental groups have developed Web sites, including
those listed in Figure 11, in attempts to educate worldwide
populations and to increase resource conservation. The New
American Dream Web site (Figure 12) contains information for
people who would like to help safeguard the environment.
On an international scale, the Environmental Sites on
the Internet Web page developed by the Royal Institute of
Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, has been rated as one
of the better ecological Web sites. Its comprehensive listing
of environmental concerns range from aquatic ecology to
wetlands.
The U.S. federal government has a number of Web
sites devoted to specific environmental concerns. For
example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
provides pollution data, including ozone levels and air
pollutants, for specific areas. Its AirData Web site displays
air pollution emissions and monitoring data from the
entire United States and is the world’s most extensive
collection of air pollution data.
ENVIRONMENT WEB EXERCISES
The New American Dream Web site encourages consumers to reduce the amount of junk mail sent to their
homes. Using the table in Figure 11, visit the Web site and write a paragraph stating how many trees are
leveled each year to provide paper for these mailings, how many garbage trucks are needed to haul this waste, and
other statistics. Read the letters that you can use to eliminate your name from bulk mail lists. To whom would you mail
these letters? How long does it take to stop these unsolicited letters?
Visit the EPA AirData Web site. What is the highest ozone level recorded in your state this past year? Where are
the nearest air pollution monitoring Web sites, and what are their levels? Where are the nearest sources of air
pollution? Read two reports about two different topics, such as acid rain and air quality, and summarize their findings.
Include information about who sponsored the research, who conducted the studies, when the data was collected, and
the impact of this pollution on the atmosphere, water, forests, and human health. Whom would you contact for further
information regarding the data and studies?

Cashing In on Financial Advice
You can manage your money with advice from financial
Web sites that offer online banking, tax help, personal
finance, and small business and commercial services.
If you do not have a personal banker or a financial
planner, consider a Web adviser to guide your invest-
ment decisions. The Yahoo! Finance Web site (Figure 13)
provides financial news and investment information.
If you are ready to ride the ups and downs of the
NASDAQ and the Dow, an abundance of Web sites listed
in Figure 14, including Reuters and Morningstar, can help
you pick companies that fit your interests and financial
needs.
Claiming to be the fastest, easiest tax publication on
the planet, the Internal Revenue Service Web site contains
procedures for filing tax appeals and contains IRS forms,
publications, and legal regulations.
FINANCE WEB EXERCISES
Visit three advice and education Web sites listed in Figure 14 and read their top business world reports. Write a
paragraph about each, summarizing these stories. Which stocks or mutual funds do these Web sites predict as
being sound investments today? What are the current market indexes for the DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average), S&P
500, and NASDAQ, and how do these figures compare with the previous day’s numbers?
Using two of the stock market Web sites listed in Figure 14, search for information about Microsoft, Adobe
Systems, and one other software vendor. Write a paragraph about each of these stocks describing the
revenues, net incomes, total assets for the previous year, current stock price per share, highest and lowest prices of

STAMP OF APPROVAL
Making a Federal Case 
for Useful Information
When it is time to buy stamps to mail your correspondence,
you no longer need to wait in long lines at your local post
office. The U.S. Postal Service has authorized several 
corporations to sell stamps online.
You can recognize U.S. Government Web sites on the
Internet by their .gov top-level domain abbreviation. For
example, The Library of Congress Web site is loc.gov.
Government and military Web sites offer a wide range of
information. The Time Service Department Web site will pro-
vide you with the correct time. If you are looking for a federal
document, FedWorld (Figure 15) lists thousands of docu-
ments distributed by the government on its Web site. For
access to the names of your congressional representatives,
visit the extensive Hieros Gamos Web site. Figure 16 shows
some of the more popular U.S. Government Web sites.
GOVERNMENT WEB EXERCISES
View the three postage Web sites listed in Figure 16. Compare and contrast the available services on each one.
Consider postage cost, necessary equipment, shipping services, security techniques, and tracking capability.
Explain why you would or would not like to use this service.
Visit the Hieros Gamos Web site listed in Figure 16. What are the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of
your two state senators and your local congressional representative? On what committees do they serve? Who
is the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and what has been this justice’s opinion on two recently decided cases? Who
are the members of the president’s cabinet? Then, visit two other Web sites listed in Figure 16. Write a paragraph about
each Web site describing its content and features.

BARGAINS GALORE
Let Your Mouse Do Your Shopping
From groceries to clothing to computers, you can buy just
about everything you need with just a few clicks of your
mouse. Electronic retailers (e-tailers) are cashing in on
cybershoppers’ purchases. Books, computer software and
hardware, and music are the hottest commodities.
The two categories of Internet shopping Web sites are
those with physical counterparts, such as Wal-Mart and
Best Buy, and those with only a Web presence, such as
Amazon and Buy (Figure 17). Popular Web shopping sites
are listed in Figure 18.
Another method of shopping for the items you need,
and maybe some you really do not need, is to visit auction
Web sites, including those listed in Figure 18. Categories
include antiques and collectibles, automotive, computers,
electronics, music, sports, sports cards and memorabilia,
and toys. Online auction Web sites can offer unusual
items, including Star Wars props and memorabilia and a
round of golf with Tiger Woods. eBay is one of thousands
of Internet auction Web sites and is the world’s largest
personal online trading community.
SHOPPING AND AUCTIONS WEB EXERCISES
Visit two of the computers and electronics and two of the miscellaneous Web sites listed in Figure 18. Write
a paragraph describing the features these Web sites offer compared with the same offerings from stores. In
another paragraph, describe any disadvantages of shopping at these Web sites instead of actually visiting a store. Then,
describe their policies for returning unwanted merchandise and for handling complaints.
Using one of the auction Web sites listed in Figure 18, search for two objects pertaining to your hobbies. For
example, if you are a sports fan, you can search for a complete set of Upper Deck cards. If you are a car buff,
search for your dream car. Describe these two items. How many people have bid on these items? Who are the sellers?
What are the opening and current bids?

For some people, space exploration is a hobby. Building
and launching model rockets allow these at-home scien-
tists to participate in exploring the great frontier of space.
For others, space exploration is their life. Numerous Web 
sites, including those in Figure 23, provide in-depth 
information about the universe.
NASA’s Astronaut Flight Lounge Web site contains
information about rockets, the space shuttle, the
International Space Station, space transportation, and
communications. Other science resources explore space-
related questions about astronomy, physics, the earth
sciences, microgravity, and robotics.
Rockets and space are not the only areas to explore 
in the world of science. Where can you find the latest 
pictures taken with the Hubble Space Telescope? Do you
know which cities experienced an earthquake today?
Have you ever wondered what a 3-D model of the amino
acid glutamine looks like? You can find the answers to
these questions and many others through the Science.gov
Web site (science.gov) shown in Figure 24.

NO PAIN, ALL GAIN
Store Personal Health Records Online
More than 70 million consumers use the Internet yearly 
to search for health information, so using the Web to 
store personal medical data is a natural extension of the
Internet’s capabilities. Internet health services and portals
are available to store your personal health history, includ-
ing prescriptions, lab test results, doctor visits, allergies,
and immunizations. Web sites such as MedlinePlus
(Figure 25) provide free health information to consumers.
In minutes, you can register with a health Web site by
choosing a user name and password. Then, you create a
record to enter your medical history. You also can store data
for your emergency contacts, primary care physicians,
specialists, blood type, cholesterol levels, blood pressure,
and insurance plan. No matter where you are in the world,
you and medical personnel can obtain records via the
Internet or fax machine. Some popular online health 
database management systems are shown in Figure 26.
HEALTH WEB EXERCISES
Access one of the health Web sites listed in Figure 26. Register yourself or a family member, and then enter
the full health history. Create an emergency medical card if the Web site provides the card option. Submit this
record and emergency card to your instructor. If you feel uncomfortable disclosing medical information for yourself or a
family member, you may enter fictitious information.
Visit three of the health Web sites listed in Figure 26. Describe the features of each. Which of the three is the
most user-friendly? Why? Describe the privacy policies of these three Web sites. Submit your analysis of these

IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT JOB
Web Helps Career Hunt
While your teachers give you valuable training to prepare
you for a career, they rarely teach you how to begin that
career. You can broaden your horizons by searching the
Internet for career information and job openings.
First, examine some of the job search Web sites. 
These resources list thousands of openings in hundreds 
of fields, companies, and locations. For example, the 
U.S. Department of Labor Web site, shown in Figure 27,
allows you to find information for different types of jobs.
This information may include the training and education
required, salary data, working conditions, job descrip-
tions, and more. In addition, many companies advertise
careers on their Web sites.
When a company contacts you for an interview, learn
as much about it and the industry as possible before the
CAREERS WEB EXERCISES
Use two of the job search Web sites listed in Figure 28 to find three companies with job openings in your field.
Make a table listing the Web site name, position available, description, salary, location, desired education, and
desired experience.
It is a good idea to acquire information before graduation about the industry in which you would like to work. Are
you interested in the automotive manufacturing industry, the restaurant service industry, or the financial industry?
Use two of the company/industry information Web sites listed in Figure 28 to research a particular career related to your
major. Write a paragraph naming the Web sites and the specific information you found, such as the nature of the work,
recommended training and qualifications, employment outlook, and earnings. Then, use two other Web sites to profile 
three companies with positions available in this field. Write a paragraph about each of these companies, describing the
headquarters’ location, sales and earnings for the previous year, total number of employees, working conditions, perks, 
and competitors.

ith the proper software, a computer is a valuable tool. Software allows users to create
letters, reports, and other documents; design Web pages and diagrams; draw images;
enhance audio and video clips; prepare taxes; play games; compose e-mail messages
and instant messages; and much more. To accomplish these and many other tasks, users work
with application software. Application software consists of programs designed to make users
more productive and/or assist them with personal tasks. Application software has a variety of uses:
1. To make business activities more efficient
2. To assist with graphics and multimedia projects
3. To support home, personal, and educational tasks
4. To facilitate communications
The table in Figure 3-1 categorizes popular types of application software by their general use.
Although many types of communications software exist, the ones listed in Figure 3-1 are applica-
tion software oriented. Successful use of application software often requires the use of one or
more of the utility programs identified at the bottom of Figure 3-1.
Application software is available in a variety of forms: packaged, custom, Web-based, open
source, shareware, freeware, and public domain.

• Packaged software is mass-produced, copyrighted retail software that meets the needs of a
wide variety of users, not just a single user or company. Microsoft Office 2007 is an example of
packaged software. Packaged software is available in retail stores or on the Web.
• Custom software performs functions specific to a business or industry. Sometimes a company
cannot find packaged software that meets its unique requirements. In this case, the company
may use programmers to develop tailor-made custom software.
• Web-based software refers to programs hosted by a Web site. Users access and interact with
Web-based software from any computer or device that is connected to the Internet. Types of
Web-based software include e-mail, word processing, and game programs. 
• Open source software is software provided for use, modification, and redistribution. This
software has no restrictions from the copyright holder regarding modification of the software’s
internal instructions and redistribution of the software. Open source software usually can be
downloaded from the Internet, sometimes at no cost.
• Shareware is copyrighted software that is distributed at no cost for a trial period. To use a
shareware program beyond that period, you send payment to the program developer.
• Freeware is copyrighted software provided at no cost to a user by an individual or a company
that retains all rights to the software. 
• Public-domain software has been donated for public use and has no copyright restrictions.
Anyone can copy or distribute public-domain software to others at no cost.
Thousands of shareware, freeware, and public-domain programs are available on the Internet for
users to download. Examples include communications programs, graphics programs, and games.
The Role of System Software
System software serves as the interface
between the user, the application software,
and the computer’s hardware (Figure 3-2).
To use application software, such as a word
processing program, your computer must
be running system software — specifically,
an operating system. Four popular personal
computer operating systems are Windows
Vista, Windows XP, Linux, and Mac OS X.
Each time you start a computer, the oper-
ating system is loaded (copied) from the
computer’s hard disk into memory. Once
the operating system is loaded, it coordi-
nates all the activities of the computer. This
includes starting application software and
transferring data among input and output
devices and memory. While the computer is
running, the operating system remains in
memory. 
101
APPLICATION SOFTWARE

FIGURE 3-2
A user does not communicate
directly with the computer hardware. Instead,
system software is the interface between the
user, the application software, and the hardware.
For example, when a user instructs the appli-
cation software to print, the application software
sends the print instruction to the system software,
which in turn sends the print instruction to the
hardware.

Working with Application Software
To use application software, you must instruct the operating system to start the program. The
steps in Figure 3-3 illustrate how to start and interact with the Paint program, which is included
with the Windows Vista operating system. The following paragraphs explain the steps in Figure 3-3.
Personal computer operating systems often use the concept of a desktop to make the computer
easier to use. The desktop is an on-screen work area that has a graphical user interface (read
Looking Ahead 3-1 for a look at the next generation of user interfaces). Step 1 of Figure 3-3 shows
icons, a button, a pointer, and a menu on the Windows Vista desktop. An icon is a small image dis-
played on the screen that represents a program, a document, or some other object. A button is a

HOW TO START A PROGRAM FROM WINDOWS VISTA
Step 1:
When you turn on a PC-compatible computer, Windows Vista loads into 
memory and displays the desktop on the screen. Click the Start button on 
the Windows taskbar to display the Start menu.
Step 2:
Click All Programs on the Start menu to display the All Programs list. 
Click Accessories in the All Programs list and then point to Paint in 
the Accessories list.
Step 3:
Click Paint. The Paint window
is displayed on the desktop.
Step 5:
Instruct the Paint program to print the 
picture. When the Print dialog box is 
displayed, click the Print button.
Step 4:
Instruct the Paint program to open a
file that is stored on the hard disk.

graphical element that you activate to cause a specific action to take place. One way to activate a
button is to click it. To click a button on the screen requires moving the pointer to the button and
then pressing and releasing a button on the mouse (usually the left mouse button). The pointer is a
small symbol displayed on the screen that moves as you move the mouse. Common pointer shapes
are an I-beam (
), a block arrow (
), and a pointing hand (
). 
The Windows Vista desktop contains a Start button on the lower-left corner of the taskbar.
When you click the Start button, the Start menu is displayed on the desktop. A menu contains a
list of commands from which you make selections. A command is an instruction that causes a
program to perform a specific action.
As illustrated in Steps 1 and 2 of Figure 3-3, when you click the Start button and click the All
Programs command on the Start menu, the All Programs list is displayed on the Start menu.
Clicking the Accessories folder in the All Programs list displays the Accessories list.
To start a program, you can click its program name on a menu or in a list. This action instructs 
the operating system to start the program, which means the program’s instructions load from
a storage medium (such as a hard disk) into memory. For example, when you click Paint in the
Accessories list, Windows Vista loads the Paint program instructions from the computer’s hard
disk into memory. 
Once loaded into memory, the program is displayed in a window on the desktop (Step 3 of
Figure 3-3). A window is a rectangular area of the screen that displays data and information. The
top of a window has a title bar, which is a horizontal space that contains the window’s name. 
With the program loaded, you can create a new file or open an existing one. A file is a named 
collection of stored data, instructions, or information. A file can contain text, images, audio, and
video. To distinguish among various files, each file has a file name. The title bar of the document
window usually displays a document’s file name. Step 4 of Figure 3-3 shows the contents of the file,
Crazy Horse Memorial, displaying in the Paint window.
In some cases, when you instruct a program to perform an activity such as printing, the program
displays a dialog box. A dialog box is a window that provides information, presents available
options, or requests a response. Dialog boxes, such as the one shown in Step 5 of Figure 3-3 often
contain option buttons, text boxes, check boxes, and command buttons.

APPLICATION SOFTWARE
Touch Drive Your Computer Screen
Computer users soon may discard the mouse and let their fingers do the work with an
innovative user interface system that displays images in thin air.
The virtual touch screen uses a rear projector system to create images that look
three dimensional and appear to float in midair. Users interact with projected objects
with their hands, so that there is no need for a mouse, monitor, physical surface, or
special gloves or eyeglasses. In specialized environments, users also can use a
scalpel, scissors, pen, or pencil to move objects.
The only hardware required to project these images is a standard video source,
such as a computer, television, DVD player, or video game console. The projected
images can be as large as 30 inches diagonally and are viewed best against a 
black background to emphasize the color contrast. For more information, visit
scsite.com/dcf5e/ch3/looking and then click Gesture Recognition.
What programs are included with Windows Vista?
Every version of Windows Vista includes Calculator, Notepad, WordPad, Internet Explorer, Windows Photo
Gallery, Windows Mail, Windows Calendar, and a variety of games. For more information, visit scsite.com/

Word Processing Software
Word processing software, sometimes called a word processor, allows users to create and
manipulate documents containing mostly text and sometimes graphics (Figure 3-5). Millions of
people use word processing software every day to develop documents such as letters, memos,
reports, fax cover sheets, mailing labels, newsletters, and Web pages.
Word processing software has many features to make documents look professional and visually
appealing. Some of these features include the capability of changing the shape and size of charac-
ters, changing the color of characters, applying special effects such as three-dimensional shadows,
and organizing text in newspaper-style columns.
Most word processing software allows users to incorporate in documents many types of graphi-
cal images, such as digital pictures and clip art. Clip art is a collection of drawings, photos, and
other images that you can insert in documents. In Figure 3-5, a user inserted an image of the Statue
of Liberty in the document. With current word processing software, you easily can modify the
appearance of an image after inserting it in the document.
All word processing software provides at least some basic capabilities to help users create and
modify documents. Defining the size of the paper on which to print and specifying the margins are
examples of some of these capabilities. If you type text that extends beyond the right page margin,
the word processing software automatically positions text at
the beginning of the next line. This feature, called wordwrap,
allows users to type words in a paragraph continually with-
out pressing the ENTER key at the end of each line. As you
type more lines of text than can be displayed on the screen,
the top portion of the document moves upward, or scrolls,
off the screen.
A major advantage of using word processing software is
that users easily can change what they have written. For
example, a user can insert, delete, or rearrange words, 
sentences, paragraphs, or entire sections. Current word
processing programs also have a feature that automat-
ically corrects errors and makes word substitutions
as users type text. For instance, when you type the
abbreviation asap, the word processing soft-
ware replaces the abbreviation with the
phrase, as soon as possible.

C6672_CH03 pp4.qxd  1/30/08  1:27 PM  Page 105

Word processing software typically includes a spelling checker, which reviews the spelling of
individual words, sections of a document, or the entire document. The spelling checker compares
the words in the document with an electronic dictionary that is part of the word processing soft-
ware. Some word processing programs also check for contextual spelling errors, such as a misuse of
homophones (words pronounced the same but have different spellings or meanings, such as one
and won).
Developing a Document
With application software, such as word processing, users create, edit, format, save, and print
documents. When you create a document, you enter text or numbers, insert images, and perform
other tasks using an input device such as a keyboard, mouse, or digital pen. If you are using
Microsoft Office Word 2007 to design a flyer, for example, you are creating a document.
To edit a document means to make changes to its existing content. Common editing tasks
include inserting, deleting, cutting, copying, and pasting. Inserting text involves adding text to a
document. Deleting text means that you are removing text or other content.
Cutting is the process of removing a portion of the document and storing it in a temporary
storage location, sometimes called a clipboard. Pasting is the process of transferring an item from
a clipboard to a specific location in a document. 
When users format a document, they change its appearance. Formatting is important because
the overall look of a document significantly can affect its ability to communicate clearly. Examples
of formatting tasks are changing the font, font size, or font style of text. 
A font is a name assigned to a specific design of characters. Cambria and Calibri are examples of
fonts. Font size indicates the size of the characters in a particular font. Font size is gauged by a
measurement system called points. A single point is about 1/72 of an inch in height. The text you
are reading in this book is about 10 point. Thus, each character is about 5/36 (10/72) of an inch in
height. A font style adds emphasis to a font. Bold, italic, and underline are examples of font
styles. Figure 3-6 illustrates fonts, font sizes, and font styles.
During the process of creating, editing, and formatting a document, the computer holds it in
memory. To keep the document for future use requires that you save it. When you save a docu-
ment, the computer transfers the document from memory to a storage medium such as a USB
flash drive, hard disk, CD, or DVD. Once saved, a document is stored permanently as a file on
the storage medium. 
When you print a document, the computer places the contents of the document on paper or some
other medium. Instead of printing a document and physically distributing it, some users e-mail the
document to others on a network such as the Internet.

Spreadsheet Software
Spreadsheet software allows users to organize data in rows and columns and perform calculations
on the data. These rows and columns collectively are called a worksheet (Figure 3-7). Most spreadsheet
software has basic features to help users create, edit, and format worksheets. The following sections
describe the features of most spreadsheet programs.
SPREADSHEET ORGANIZATION
Typically, a spreadsheet file is 
similar to a notebook that can 
contain more than 1,000 related
individual worksheets. Data
is organized vertically in
columns and horizontally in
rows on each worksheet
(Figure 3-7). Each worksheet
usually can have more than
16,000 columns and 1 million
rows. One or more letters
identify each column, and a
number identifies each row. Only a
small fraction of these columns and
rows are displayed on the screen at
one time. Scrolling through the
worksheet displays different 
parts of it on the screen.
A cell is the intersection of a 
column and row. The spreadsheet
software identifies cells by the 
column and row in which they are
located. For example, the intersection
of column B and row 8 is referred to
as cell B8. As shown in Figure 3-7, 
cell B8 contains the number, 614,754, which represents the advertising expenses for the first year.
Cells may contain three types of data: labels, values, and formulas. The text, or label, entered in a
cell identifies the worksheet data and helps organize the worksheet. Using descriptive labels, such as
Total Expenses and Net Income, helps make a worksheet more meaningful.
CALCULATIONS
Many of the worksheet cells shown in Figure 3-7 contain a number, called a value,
that can be used in a calculation. Other cells, however, contain formulas that generate values. A
formula performs calculations on the data in the worksheet and displays the resulting value in a cell,
usually the cell containing the formula. When creating a worksheet, you can enter your own formulas. 
In many spreadsheet programs, you begin a formula with an equal sign, a plus sign, or a minus
sign. Next, you enter the formula, separating cell references (e.g., B8) with operators. Common 
operators are + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division. In Figure 3-7, 
for example, cell B13 could contain the formula =B8+B9+B10+B11+B12, which would add together
(sum) the contents of cells B8, B9, B10, B11, and B12. That is, this formula calculates the total
expenses for the first year.
A function is a predefined formula that performs common calculations such as adding the values
in a group of cells or generating a value such as the time or date. For example, instead of using 
the formula =B8+B9+B10+B11+B12 to calculate the total expenses for the first year, you could use
the SUM function. This function requires you to identify the starting cell and the ending cell in a
group to be summed, separating these two cell references with a colon. For example, the function
=SUM(B8:B12) instructs the spreadsheet program to add all of the numbers in cells B8 through B12.

RECALCULATION
One of the more powerful features of spreadsheet software is its capability 
of recalculating the rest of the worksheet when data in a worksheet changes. When you enter a
new value to change data in a cell, any value affected by the change is updated automatically 
and instantaneously.
CHARTING
Another standard feature of spreadsheet software is charting, which depicts the data
in graphical form. A visual representation of data through charts often makes it easier for users 
to see at a glance the relationship among the numbers. Three popular chart types are line charts,
column charts, and pie charts. Figure 3-8
shows examples of these charts that were
plotted using the five types of expenses for
each of the years shown in the worksheet in
Figure 3-7 on the previous page. A line chart
shows a trend during a period of time, as
indicated by a rising or falling line. A col-
umn chart, also called a bar chart, displays
bars of various lengths to show the relation-
ship of data. The bars can be horizontal,
vertical, or stacked on top of one another. 
A pie chart, which has the shape of a round
pie cut into slices, shows the relationship of
parts to a whole.
Database Software
A database is a collection of data 
organized in a manner that allows access,
retrieval, and use of that data. In a manual
database, you might record data on paper
and store it in a filing cabinet. With a com-
puterized database, such as the one shown
in Figure 3-9, the computer stores the data
in an electronic format on a storage medium
such as a hard disk.
Database software is application software
that allows users to create, access, and man-
age a database. Using database software,
you can add, change, and delete data in a
database; sort and retrieve data from the
database; and create forms and reports using
the data in the database.
With most popular personal computer
database programs, a database consists of a
collection of tables, organized in rows and
columns. Each row, called a record, contains
data about a given person, product, object, or
event. Each column, called a field, contains a
specific category of data within a record.
The Beauty Supply database shown in
Figure 3-9 consists of two tables: a Customer
table and a Sales Rep table. The Customer
table contains eleven records (rows), each
storing data about one customer. The cus-
tomer data is grouped into six fields
(columns): Customer Number, Customer
Name, Telephone, Balance, Amount Paid,
108

and Sales Rep Number. The Balance field, for
instance, contains the balance due from the cus-
tomer. The Customer and Sales Rep tables relate
to one another through a common field, Sales Rep
Number.
Users run queries to retrieve data. A query is a
request for specific data from the database. For
example, a query might request a list of customers
whose balance is greater than $500. Database soft-
ware can take the results of a query and present it
in a window on the screen or send it to the printer.
Presentation Graphics Software
Presentation graphics software is application
software that allows users to create visual aids for
presentations to communicate ideas, messages, and
other information to a group. The presentations
can be viewed as slides, sometimes called a slide
show, that are displayed on a large monitor or on 
a projection screen (Figure 3-10).
Presentation graphics software typically 
provides a variety of predefined presentation
formats that define complementary colors for
backgrounds, text, and graphical accents on the
slides. This software also provides a variety of
layouts for each individual slide such as a title
slide, a two-column slide, and a slide with clip
art, a chart, a table, a diagram, or animation. In
addition, you can enhance any text, charts, and
graphical images on a slide with 3-D and other
special effects such as shading, shadows, and
textures.
When building a presentation, users can set
the slide timing so that the presentation auto-
matically displays the next slide after a preset
delay. Presentation graphics software allows you
to apply special effects to the transition between
slides. One slide, for example, might fade away
as the next slide is displayed.
You can view or print a finished presentation
in a variety of formats, including an outline of
text from each slide and audience handouts that
show completed slides.
Presentation graphics software typically
includes a clip gallery that provides images, 
pictures, video clips, and audio clips to enhance
multimedia presentations. Some audio and video
editing programs work with presentation graphics
software, providing users with an easy means to
record and insert video, music, and audio com-
mentary in a presentation. Presentation graphics
software incorporates features such as checking
spelling, formatting, research, ink input, and con-
verting an existing slide show into a format for 
the World Wide Web.

CHAPTER 3
APPLICATION SOFTWARE
Note Taking Software 
Note taking software is application software that enables users to enter typed text, handwritten
comments, drawings, or sketches anywhere on a page and then save the page as part of a note-
book (Figure 3-11). Users also can include audio recordings as part of their notes.  Once the notes
are captured (entered and saved), users easily can organize them, reuse them, and share them. 
On a desktop or notebook computer, users enter
notes primarily via the keyboard or microphone.
On a Tablet PC, however, the primary input device
is a digital pen. Users find note taking software
convenient during meetings, class lectures, confer-
ences, in libraries, and other settings that previ-
ously required a pencil and tablet of paper for
recording thoughts and discussions.
Personal Information Manager Software
A personal information manager (PIM) is 
application software that includes an appointment 
calendar, address book, notepad, and other features
to help users organize personal information. The
appointment calendar allows you to schedule 
activities for a particular day and time. With the
address book, you can enter and maintain names,
addresses, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses
of customers, coworkers, family members, and
friends. You can use the notepad to record ideas,
reminders, and other important information.
Most mobile devices, such as smart phones and
PDAs, include, among many other features, PIM
functionality. You can synchronize, or coordinate,
information so that both the mobile device and your
personal computer and/or organization’s server have
the latest version of any updated information.
Personal Mobile Device Business Software
A huge variety of business software is available for mobile devices, such as smart phones. Some
software is preloaded on the device, while other software can be downloaded or accessed on
miniature storage media, such as memory cards. Nearly all mobile devices include PIM software.
Other business software for mobile devices allows users to create documents and worksheets,
manage databases and lists, create slide shows, take notes, manage budgets and finances, view
and edit photos, read electronic books, plan travel routes, compose and read e-mail messages,
send instant messages, and browse the Web. A variety of other programs are available for mobile
devices, which enable you to send text and picture messages, take digital pictures, record videos,
listen to music, view maps and directions, customize your background, change your ringtones,
and play games.
Software Suite
A software suite is a collection of individual programs sold as a single package. Business software
suites typically include, at a minimum, the following programs: word processing, spreadsheet, e-mail,
and presentation graphics. Popular software suites are Microsoft Office 2007 and Apple iWork.
Software suites offer two major advantages: lower cost and ease of use. Buying a collection of
programs in a software suite usually costs significantly less than purchasing them individually.
Software suites provide ease of use because the programs within a software suite normally use a
similar interface and share features such as clip art and a spelling checker.
FIGURE 3-11
With note taking software, mobile users can handwrite
notes, draw sketches, and type text.
C6672_CH03 pp4.qxd  1/30/08  1:27 PM  Page 110

Project Management Software
Project management software allows a
user to plan, schedule, track, and analyze 
the events, resources, and costs of a project
(Figure 3-12). Project management software
helps users manage project variables, allow-
ing them to complete a project on time and
within budget. An engineer, for example,
might use project management software to
manage new product development to sched-
ule timing of market analysis, product design,
marketing, and public relations activities.
Accounting Software
Accounting software helps companies
record and report their financial transactions
(Figure 3-13). With accounting software, busi-
ness users perform accounting activities
related to the general ledger, accounts receiv-
able, accounts payable, purchasing, invoicing,
and payroll functions. Accounting software
also enables business users to write and print
checks, track checking account activity, and
update and reconcile balances on demand.
Most accounting software supports online
credit checks, billing, direct deposit, and pay-
roll services. Some accounting software offers
more complex features such as job costing and
estimating, time tracking, multiple company
reporting, foreign currency reporting, and
forecasting the amount of raw materials
needed for products. The cost of accounting
software for small businesses ranges from less
than one hundred to several thousand dollars.
Accounting software for large businesses can
cost several hundred thousand dollars.
Document Management Software
Document management software provides
a means for sharing, distributing, and search-
ing through documents by converting them
into a format that can be viewed by any user
(Figure 3-14). The converted document, which
mirrors the original document’s appearance,
can be viewed and printed without the soft-
ware that created the original document. A
popular file format used by document man-
agement software to save converted docu-
ments is PDF (Portable Document Format),
developed by Adobe Systems. To view and
print a PDF file, you need Acrobat Reader soft-
ware, which can be downloaded free from
Adobe’s Web site.

Enterprise Computing Software
A large organization, commonly referred to as an enterprise, requires special computing solutions
because of its size and large geographical distribution. A typical enterprise consists of a wide variety of
departments, centers, and divisions — collectively known as functional units. Nearly every enterprise
has the following functional units: human resources, accounting and finance, engineering or product
development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, customer service, and information
technology. Each of these functional units has specialized software requirements. 
GRAPHICS AND MULTIMEDIA SOFTWARE
In addition to business software, many people work with software designed specifically for their field
of work. Power users such as engineers, architects, desktop publishers, and graphic artists often use
sophisticated software that allows them to work with graphics and multimedia. This software includes
computer-aided design, desktop publishing, paint/image editing, photo editing, video and audio edit-
ing, multimedia authoring, and Web page authoring. Figure 3-15 lists the more popular programs for
each of these categories, specifically designed for professional or more technically astute users. Some of
these programs incorporate user-friendly interfaces, or scaled-down versions, making it possible for
the home and small business users to create documents using these programs. The following sections
discuss the features and functions of graphics and multimedia software.

Computer-Aided Design
Computer-aided design (CAD) software is a
sophisticated type of application software that
assists a professional user in creating engineering,
architectural, and scientific designs. For example,
engineers create design plans for vehicles and
security systems. Architects design building
structures and floor plans (Figure 3-16). Scientists
design drawings of molecular structures.
Desktop Publishing Software (for the
Professional)
Desktop publishing (DTP) software enables
professional designers to create sophisticated
documents that contain text, graphics, and many
colors (Figure 3-17). Professional DTP software is
ideal for the production of high-quality color doc-
uments such as textbooks, corporate newsletters,
marketing literature, product catalogs, and
annual reports. Today’s DTP software also allows
designers to convert a color document into a
format for use on the World Wide Web.
Paint/Image Editing Software (for the
Professional)
Graphic artists, multimedia professionals,
technical illustrators, and desktop publishers
use paint software and image editing software
to create and modify graphical images such as
those used in DTP documents and Web pages.
Paint software, also called illustration software,
allows users to draw pictures (Figure 3-18),
shapes, and other graphical images with vari-
ous on-screen tools such as a pen, brush, eye-
dropper, and paint bucket. Image editing
software provides the capabilities of paint
software and also includes the capability to
enhance and modify existing pictures and
images. Modifications can include adjusting
or enhancing image colors, adding special
effects such as shadows and glows, creating
animations, and image stitching, which is the
process of combining multiple images into a
larger image.
Professional photo editing software is a type
of image editing software that allows photogra-
phers, videographers, engineers, scientists, and
other high-volume digital photo users to edit
and customize digital photos. With professional
photo editing software, users can retouch photos,
crop images, remove red-eye, change image
shapes, color-correct images, straighten images,
remove or rearrange objects in a photo, and
apply filters.

Video and Audio Editing Software (for the Professional)
Video editing software allows professionals to modify a segment of a video, called a clip
(Figure 3-19). For example, users can reduce the length of a video clip, reorder a series of clips, or add
special effects such as words that move horizontally across the screen. Video editing software typically
includes audio editing capabilities. Audio editing software lets users modify audio clips, produce 
studio-quality soundtracks, and add audio to video clips. Most television shows and movies are created
or enhanced using video and audio editing software. Read Ethics & Issues 3-1 for a related discussion.

CHAPTER 3
APPLICATION SOFTWARE
FIGURE 3-19
With video editing software, users modify video
clips. 
Multimedia Authoring Software
Multimedia authoring software allows users to combine
text, graphics, audio, video, and animation into an interactive
application (Figure 3-20). With this software, users control the
placement of text and images and the duration of sounds,
video, and animation. Once created, multimedia presentations
often take the form of interactive computer-based presenta-
tions or Web-based presentations designed to facilitate learn-
ing, demonstrate product functionality, and elicit direct-user
participation. Training centers, educational institutions, and
online magazine publishers all use multimedia authoring 
software to develop interactive applications. These applica-
tions may be available on a CD or DVD, over a local area 
network, or via the Internet.
Web Page Authoring Software
Web page authoring software helps users of all skill levels
create Web pages that include graphical images, video, audio,
animation, and special effects with interactive content. In
addition, many Web page authoring programs allow users
to organize, manage, and maintain Web sites.
Application software, such as Word and Excel, often
includes Web page authoring features. This allows home
users to create basic Web pages using application software
they already own. For more sophisticated Web pages, users
work with Web page authoring software. 
FIGURE 3-20
Multimedia authoring software allows you to create
dynamic presentations that include text, graphics, video, sound, and
animation. 
Should It Be Legal to Share Copyrighted
Music or Video Files over a Network?
It is usually illegal to use networks to share copyrighted music or
video files. Despite this, a number of file-sharing networks exist,
and millions of Americans use file-sharing software to locate and
download copyrighted music and videos without paying. Much of
this illegal activity takes place at colleges and universities. To com-
bat illegal file sharing, some schools have turned to new programs
that intentionally slow the performance of file-sharing software.
Other schools have accepted the trend and subscribed to large 
collections of music for all students to share legally. The Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA) has been filing lawsuits
against people suspected of downloading copyrighted music.
Those found guilty can be liable for fines up to $150,000 for every
stolen song. The RIAA maintains that downloading copyrighted
music steals from both the recording artist and the recording
industry. Yet, many people feel that the response to sharing copy-
righted music and video files is excessive. They argue that copying
music from the radio to an audio cassette is legal and insist that
downloading copyrighted music is no different. Besides, someone
who downloads a copyrighted song later may be inspired to 
purchase an artist’s CD. Are slowing file-sharing software and 
filing lawsuits unwarranted reactions to what some people con-
sider a victimless violation? Why? Is it a good idea for schools to
subscribe to music collections?

APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR COMMUNICATIONS
One of the main reasons people use computers is to communicate and share information with others.
Some communications software is considered system software because it works with hardware and
transmission media. Other communications software performs specific tasks for users, and thus, is con-
sidered application software. Chapter 2 presented a variety of application software for communications,
which is summarized in the table in Figure 3-33. Read Ethics & Issues 3-2 for a related discussion.

POPULAR UTILITY PROGRAMS
Should Companies Monitor Employees’ E-Mail and Internet Traffic?
Most companies monitor (after transmission) or intercept (during transmission) employees’ e-mail messages. Employers can use software
to automatically find personal or offensive e-mail messages that have been sent or received, and intercept and filter messages while they are
being sent or received. Companies also monitor other Internet traffic such as Web sites visited by employees and how much time employees
spend sending instant messages and visiting chat rooms. Companies perform this monitoring to improve productivity, increase security,
reduce misconduct, and control liability risks. Few laws regulate employee monitoring, and courts have given employers a great deal of lee-
way in watching work on company-owned computers. In one case, an employee’s termination for using her office e-mail system to com-
plain about her boss was upheld, even though the company allowed e-mail use for personal communications. The court decreed that the
employee’s messages were inappropriate for workplace communications. Many employees believe that excessive monitoring of software vio-
lates their privacy rights. State laws usually favor the privacy of the employee, while federal laws tend to favor the employer’s right to perform
such monitoring. To reduce employee anxiety about monitoring and to follow some state laws, companies publish written policies called
acceptable use policies (AUP). AUPs should provide clear descriptions of acceptable and unacceptable behavior, respect employee needs and
time, and establish a balance between security and privacy. Often, the consequence for violating an AUP is that the violator is fired. Should
companies monitor or intercept employees’ Internet communications? Why or why not? How can a company balance workplace security and
productivity with employee privacy? What types of behavior should be covered by an AUP? Why? Should employees have an expectation of
free speech in the workplace? Why or why not? Is intercepting and filtering e-mail more offensive than monitoring e-mail? Why?
POPULAR UTILITY PROGRAMS
Utility programs are considered system software because they assist a user with controlling or
maintaining the operation of a computer, its devices, or its software. Utility programs typically offer
features that provide an environment conducive to successful use of application software. One of 
the more important utility programs protects a computer against viruses. A computer virus is a
potentially damaging computer program that affects, or infects, a computer negatively by altering
the way the computer works without the user’s knowledge or permission. 
Other features of utility programs include protecting a computer against unauthorized intrusions,
removing spyware, filtering e-mail and Web content, managing files and disks, compressing files, 
backing up, playing media files, burning (recording on) a CD or DVD, and maintaining a personal 
computer. The table in Figure 3-34 briefly describes several types of utility programs.

WEB-BASED SOFTWARE
As previously mentioned, Web-based software refers to programs hosted by a Web site. Users often
interact with Web-based software, sometimes called a Web application, directly at the host’s Web
site. Some Web sites, however, require you download the software to your local computer or device.
Web-based software sites often store users’ data and information on their servers. Web-based soft-
ware sites may provide users with an option of storing data locally on their own personal computer
or mobile device.
Many of the previously discussed types of application software have Web-based options. For
example, Google Docs and Spreadsheets is a Web-based word processing and spreadsheet program,
and Windows Live Hotmail is a Web-based e-mail program.
Some Web sites provide free
access to the Web-based software,
such as the spreadsheet program
shown in Figure 3-35. Another site
creates a map and driving direc-
tions when a user enters a starting
and destination point. Others offer
part of their Web-based software
free and charge for access to a more
comprehensive program.
Experts often use the term Web
2.0 to describe Web sites that offer
Web-based software. Recall that
Web 2.0 refers to Web sites that
provide users with a means to
share and/or store personal infor-
mation through Web-based soft-
ware and may allow users to
modify Web site content. Read

Using Semantics with Web 3.0
When Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989, he laid the
foundation for allowing computers to look at words on the Internet and then
make random associations. Fifteen years later, he led a group of researchers
who set standards for the semantic Web, also called Web 3.0, which will give
the machines the capability to understand the words’ meanings.
Such artificial intelligence allows computers to locate and share information
on the Internet based on context, so that they automatically can reason and
then differentiate between such concepts as a dog bark and tree bark. This
classification system has drawn interest in many areas, particularly for entertainment and travel Web sites and
in business and scientific databases. The result will be smarter search engines and automated Web tasks such
as comparison shopping.
IBM, Google, and Oracle are among the large corporations embracing semantic technology. For more

LEARNING AIDS AND SUPPORT TOOLS 
FOR APPLICATION SOFTWARE
Learning how to use application software effectively involves time and practice. To assist in
the learning process, many programs provide online Help (Figure 3-36) and Web-based Help.
Online Help is the electronic equivalent of a user manual. It usually is integrated in a
program. In most programs, a function key or a button on the screen starts the Help feature.
When using a program, you can use the Help feature to ask a question or access the Help
topics in subject or alphabetical order. 
Most online Help also links to Web sites that offer Web-based help, which provides updates
and more comprehensive resources to respond to technical issues about software. Some Web
sites contain chat rooms, in which a user can talk directly with a technical support person.
Many books are available to help you learn to use the features of personal computer
programs. These books typically are available in bookstores and software stores.
Web-Based Training
Web-based training (WBT) is a type of CBT (computer-based training) that uses Internet
technology and consists of application software on the Web. Similar to CBT, WBT typically
consists of self-directed, self-paced instruction about a topic. WBT is popular in business,
industry, and schools for teaching new skills or enhancing existing skills of employees, 
teachers, or students.
Many Web sites offer WBT to the general public. Such training covers a wide range of topics,
from how to change a flat tire to creating documents in Word. Many of these Web sites are free.
Others require registration and payment to take the complete Web-based course.
WBT often is combined with other materials for distance learning and e-learning. Distance
learning is the delivery of education at one location while the learning takes place at other
locations. E-learning, short for electronic learning, is the delivery of education via some elec-
tronic method such as the Internet, networks, or CDs/DVDs. To enhance communications, 
e-learning systems also may include video conferencing, e-mail, blogs, wikis, newsgroups,
chat rooms, and groupware (Figure 3-37).

Copying Software – A Computer Crime!
Usually, when you buy software, you legally can make one copy of the software for backup purposes. Despite the law, many people make multiple
copies, either to share or to sell. Often, the sharing is done online. In a recent survey, more than 50 percent of students and 25 percent of instruc-
tors admitted that they illegally had copied, or illegally would copy, software. Microsoft, a leading software manufacturer, estimates that almost 25
percent of software in the United States has been copied illegally. The Business Software Alliance, an industry trade association, believes that 35
percent of all software installed in the world is copied illegally. The illegally copied software is valued at $40 billion, and the amount is increasing
annually by up to 15 percent per year. Illegally copied software costs the software industry billions a year in lost revenues, and the law allows fines
up to $150,000 for each illegal copy of software. People and companies copy software illegally for a variety of reasons, insisting that software
prices are too high, software often is copied for educational or other altruistic purposes, copied software makes people more productive, no restric-
tions should be placed on the use of software after it is purchased, and everyone copies software. What should be the penalty for copying soft-
ware? Why? Can you counter the reasons people give for copying software illegally? How? Would you copy software illegally? Why or why not? 
If you knew a person had copied software illegally, would you report him or her to the authorities? Why or why not?
Help Desk Specialist
A Help Desk specialist position is an entryway into the information technology (IT) field. A Help Desk 
specialist deals with problems in hardware, software, or communications systems. Job requirements
may include the following:
•
Solve procedural and software questions both in person and over the telephone
•
Develop and maintain Help Desk operations manuals
•
Assist in training new Help Desk personnel
Usually, a Help Desk specialist must be knowledgeable about the major programs in use. Entry-level positions primarily involve answering
calls from people with questions. Other positions provide additional assistance and assume further responsibilities, often demanding greater
knowledge and problem-solving skills that can lead to more advanced positions in the IT field. Some Help Desk specialists visit homes and
small businesses to act as a personal help desk person. Help Desk specialist is an ideal position for people who must work irregular hours,
because many companies need support people to work evenings, weekends, or part-time.
Educational requirements are less stringent than they are for other jobs in the computer field. In some cases, a high school diploma 
is sufficient. Advancement requires a minimum of a two-year degree, while management generally requires a bachelor’s degree in IT or 
a related field. Certification is another way Help Desk specialists can increase their attractiveness in the marketplace. Entry-level salaries
range from $38,000 to $60,000 per year. Managers range from $55,000 to $95,000. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch3/

Dan Bricklin
VisiCalc Developer
When Dan Bricklin was enrolled at the Harvard Business School in the 1970s, he often used his calculator to determine the
effect of changing one value on a balance sheet. He recognized the need to develop a program that would perform a series of
calculations automatically when the first number was entered.
He named his creation VisiCalc, short for Visible Calculator. He and a friend formed a company called Software Arts and
programmed the VisiCalc prototype using Apple Basic on an Apple II computer. The small program was the first piece of 
application software that provided a reason for businesses to buy Apple computers. It included many features found in today’s
spreadsheet software.
As president of Software Garden, Inc., a small consulting and software-development firm, one of his latest projects released
in 2007 is wikiCalc, a Web authoring tool that uses a spreadsheet-style interface to operate a browser. For more information,

Chapter Review
The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students regarding
any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch3/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
What Are the Categories of Application Software?
Application software consists of programs designed to make users more productive and/or assist them with personal tasks.
The major categories of application software are business software; graphics and multimedia software; home, personal, and
educational software; and communications software.
How Do You Work with Application Software?
Personal computer operating systems often use the concept of a desktop, which is an on-screen work area that has a
graphical user interface. To start a program in Windows Vista, move the pointer to the Start button on the taskbar and
click the Start button by pressing and releasing a button on the mouse. Then, click the program name on the menu or in a
list. Once loaded in memory, the program is displayed in a window on the desktop.
What Are the Key Features of Widely Used Business Programs?
Business software assists people in becoming more effective and efficient while performing daily business activities. Business
software includes the following programs. Word processing software allows users to create a document by entering text or
numbers and inserting graphical images, edit the document by making changes to its existing content, and format the docu-
ment by changing its appearance. Spreadsheet software allows users to organize data in rows and columns, perform cal-
culations, recalculate when data changes, and chart the data in graphical form. Database software allows users to create a
database, which is a collection of data organized in a manner that allows access, retrieval, and use of that data. Presentation
graphics software allows users to create slides that are displayed on a monitor or on a projection screen. Note taking software
enables users to enter typed text, handwritten comments, drawings, and sketches. A personal information manager (PIM)
includes an appointment calendar, address book, notepad, and other features to help users organize personal information. A
software suite is a collection of individual programs sold as a single package. Project management software allows users to
plan, schedule, track, and analyze the events, resources, and costs of a project. Accounting software helps companies record
and report their financial transactions. Document management software provides a means for sharing, distributing, and
searching through documents by converting them into a format that can be viewed by any user.
What Are the Key Features of Widely Used Graphics and Multimedia Programs?
Graphics and multimedia software includes the following. Computer-aided design (CAD) software assists a professional user
in creating engineering, architectural, and scientific designs. Desktop publishing (DTP) software enables professional design-
ers to create sophisticated documents that contain text, graphics, and colors. Paint software allows users to draw pictures,
shapes, and other graphical images with various on-screen tools. Image editing software provides the capabilities of paint 
software and also includes the capability to modify existing images. Professional photo editing software is a type of image
editing software that allows photographers, videographers, engineers, scientists, and other high-volume digital photo users 
to edit and customize digital photos. Video editing software allows professionals to modify a segment of a video, called a clip.
Audio editing software lets users modify audio clips, produce studio-quality soundtracks, and add audio to video clips.
Multimedia authoring software allows users to combine text, graphics, audio, video, and animation into an interactive 
application. Web page authoring software helps users create Web pages and organize and maintain Web sites.
What Are the Key Features of Widely Used Home, Personal, and Educational Programs?
Software for home, personal, and educational use includes the following. A software suite (for personal use) combines 
application software into a single, easy-to-use package. Personal finance software is an accounting program that helps users
balance their checkbooks, pay bills, track personal income and expenses, track investments, and evaluate financial plans.
Personal DTP software helps home and small business users create newsletters, brochures, flyers, advertisements, postcards,
greeting cards, letterhead, business cards, banners, calendars, logos, and Web pages. Personal paint/image editing software
provides an easy-to-use interface and includes various simplified tools that allow you to draw pictures, shapes, and other
images and to modify existing graphics and photos. Application software often includes a clip art/image gallery, which 
is a collection of clip art and photos. Home design/landscaping software assists users with the design, remodeling, or

improvement of a home, deck, or landscape. Travel and mapping software allows users to view maps, determine routes,
and locate points of interest. Educational software teaches a particular skill. Reference software provides valuable and
thorough information for all individuals. 
What Are the Types of Application Software Used in Communications?
Application software for communications includes Web browsers to access and view Web pages; e-mail programs to
transmit messages via a network; instant messaging software for real-time exchange of messages or files; chat room software
to have real-time, online typed conversations; text messaging software; RSS aggregator program to keep track of changes
made to Web sites; blog software, or blogware, to create and maintain a blog; newsgroup/message board programs that allow
online written discussions; FTP programs to upload and download files on the Internet; VoIP (Internet telephony), which
allows users to speak to other users over the Internet; and video conferencing software for meetings on a network.
What Are the Functions of Utility Programs?
Utility programs support the successful use of application software. An antivirus program protects a computer against a
computer virus, which is a potentially damaging computer program. A personal firewall detects and protects a personal com-
puter from unauthorized intrusions. A spyware remover detects and deletes spyware, adware, and other similar programs.
An anti-spam program removes spam (Internet junk mail). A Web filter restricts access to specified Web sites. A pop-up
blocker disables pop-up windows. A file manager provides functions related to file and disk management. A file compression
utility shrinks the size of a file. A backup utility allows users to copy selected files or an entire hard disk to another storage
medium. A media player allows you to view images and animation, listen to audio, and watch video. A CD/DVD burner
writes files to a recordable CD or DVD. A personal computer maintenance utility fixes operating system and disk problems.
What Web-Based Software and Learning Aids Are Available for Application Software?
Web-based software, sometimes called a Web application, refers to programs hosted by a Web site. Many types of 
application software have Web-based options. To assist in the learning process, many programs provide online Help,
which is the electronic equivalent of a user manual. Most online Help also links to Web-based help, which provides
updates and more comprehensive resources to respond to technical issues about software.

the exercises and submit them to your instructor. Premium Activity: The 
icon indicates you can see a visual demonstration
of the associated Learn How To activity by visiting scsite.com/dcf5e/ch3/howto.
LEARN HOW TO 1: Save a File in Application Software
When you use application software, most of the time you either will be creating a new file or modifying an existing file. 
For example, if you are using a word processor, when you create a new document, the document is a file.
When you create or modify a file, it is contained in RAM. If you turn off your computer or lose electrical power, the file 
will not be retained. In order to retain the file, you must save it on disk or other permanent storage, such as a USB drive.
As you create the file, you should save the file often. To save a new file, you must complete several tasks:
1. Initiate an action indicating you want to save the file, such as selecting 
Save on the File menu.
2. Designate where the file should be stored. This includes
identifying both the device (such as drive C) and the folder
(such as Documents).
3. Specify the name of the file, using the file name rules as
specified by the application or operating system.
4. Click the Save button to save the file.
Tasks 2 through 4 normally can be completed using a dialog
box such as the one shown in Figure 3-38.
If you use application software to create or modify a file and 
attempt to close the program prior to saving the new or modified
file, the program may display a dialog box that asks if you want
to save the file. If you click the Yes button, a modified file will be saved
using the same file name in the same location from which it was retrieved. Saving a new file requires that you complete tasks
2 through 4.
Exercise
1. Start the WordPad program from the Accessories list in the All Programs list.
2. Type Saving a file is the best insurance against losing work.
3. Click the Save button on the WordPad toolbar. What dialog box is displayed? Where will the file be saved? What is the
default file name? If you wanted to save the file on the desktop, what would you do? Click the Cancel button in the dialog
box. Submit your answers to your instructor.
4. Click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the WordPad window. What happened? Click the Yes button in the
WordPad dialog box. What happened? Connect a USB flash drive to one of the computer’s USB ports. Select the USB drive as
the location for saving the file. Name the file, Chapter 3 How To 1. Save the file. What happened when you clicked the Save
button? Submit your answers to your instructor.
LEARN HOW TO 2: Install and Uninstall Application Software
When you purchase application software, you must install the software on the computer where you want to run it. The exact
installation process varies with each program, but generally you must complete the following steps:
1. Insert the CD or DVD containing the application software into a drive.
2. The opening window will appear. If the CD or DVD contains more than one program, choose the program you want to
install. Click the Continue or Next button.
3. Some file extractions will occur and then an Install Wizard will begin. The method for using this wizard will vary, but you
normally must accomplish the following steps by completing the directions within the wizard:
a. Accept the terms of the license agreement.
b. Identify where on your computer the software will be stored. The software usually selects a default location on drive C,
and you normally will accept the default location.
c. Select any default options for the software.
d. Click a button to install the software.
4. A Welcome/Help screen often will be displayed. It might provide help or documentation. Click a button to finish the
installation process.
After you have installed software, use it in the manner you require. At some point, you may want to remove software from
your computer. Most application software includes uninstall programming that will remove the program and all its software

THE SYSTEM UNIT
W
hether you are a home user or a business user, you most likely will make the decision
to purchase a new computer or upgrade an existing computer within the next several
years. Thus, you should understand the purpose of each component in a computer.
As Chapter 1 discussed, a computer includes devices used for input, processing, output, storage,
and communications. Many of these components are part of the system unit.
The system unit is a case that contains electronic components of the computer used to process
data. System units are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. The case of the system unit is
made of metal or plastic and protects the internal electronic components from damage. All 
computers have a system unit (Figure 4-1).
On desktop personal computers, the electronic components and most storage devices are part of
the system unit. Other devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, microphone, monitor, printer, USB
flash drive, portable media player, scanner, PC video camera, and speakers, normally occupy space
outside the system unit. On notebook computers, the keyboard and pointing device often occupy
the area on the top of the system unit, and the display attaches to the system unit by hinges. The

location of the system unit on a Tablet PC varies, depending on the design of the Tablet PC. Some
models build the system unit behind the display (as shown in Figure 4-1), while others position the
system unit below the keyboard (shown later in the chapter). The system unit on an Ultra-Mobile
PC, a smart phone, and a PDA usually consumes the entire device. On these mobile computers and
devices, the display often is built into the system unit. With game consoles, the input and output
devices, such as controllers and a television, reside outside the system unit. On handheld game con-
soles and portable media players, by contrast, the packaging around the system unit houses the
input devices and display.
At some point, you might have to open the system unit on a desktop personal computer to
replace or install a new electronic component. For this reason, you should be familiar with the
electronic components of a system unit. Figure 4-2 identifies some of these components, which
include the processor, memory, adapter cards, drive bays, and the power supply.
The processor interprets and carries out the basic instructions that operate a computer. Memory
typically holds data waiting to be processed and instructions waiting to be executed. The elec-
tronic components and circuitry of the system unit, such as the processor and memory, usually
are part of or are connected to a circuit board called the motherboard. Many motherboards also
integrate sound, video, modem, and networking capabilities.
135

C6672_CH04 pp3.qxd  1/30/08  1:30 PM  Page 135

Adapter cards are circuit boards that provide connections and functions not built into the 
motherboard or expand on the capability of features integrated into the motherboard. For 
example, a sound card and a video card are two types of adapter cards found in some desktop 
personal computers today. 
Devices outside the system unit often attach to ports on the system unit by a connector on a
cable. These devices may include a keyboard, mouse, microphone, monitor, printer, scanner, USB
flash drive, card reader/writer, digital camera, PC video camera, and speakers. A drive bay holds
one or more disk drives. The power supply allows electricity to travel through a power cord from
a wall outlet into a computer.
The Motherboard
The motherboard, sometimes called a system board, is the main circuit board of the system
unit. Many electronic components attach to the motherboard; others are built into it. Figure 4-3
shows a photo of a current desktop personal computer motherboard and identifies its expansion
slots, processor chip, and memory slots. Memory chips are installed on memory cards (modules)
that fit in a slot on the motherboard.
A computer chip is a small piece of semiconducting material, usually silicon, on which
integrated circuits are etched. An integrated circuit contains many microscopic pathways capable
of carrying electrical current. Each integrated circuit can contain millions of elements such as
resistors, capacitors, and transistors. Specific types of chips are discussed later in the chapter.

PROCESSOR
The processor, also called the central processing unit (CPU), interprets and carries out the basic
instructions that operate a computer. The processor significantly impacts overall computing
power and manages most of a computer’s operations. On a personal computer, all functions of
the processor usually are on a single chip. Some computer and chip manufacturers use the term
microprocessor to refer to a personal computer processor chip.
Most processor chip manufacturers now offer multi-core processors. A multi-core processor is a
chip with two or more separate processors. Two common multi-core processors used today are
dual-core and quad-core. A dual-core processor is a chip that contains two separate processors.
Similarly, a quad-core processor is a chip with four separate processors. Each processor on a
multi-core chip generally runs at a slower clock speed than a single-core processor, but multi-core
chips typically increase overall performance. For example, although a dual-core processor does
not double the processing speed of a single-core processor, it can approach those speeds. Multi-
core processors also are energy efficient, requiring lower levels of power consumption and 
emitting less heat in the system unit.
Processors contain a control unit and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). These two components
work together to perform processing operations. Figure 4-4 illustrates how other devices that are 
connected to the computer communicate with the processor to carry out a task.

FIGURE 4-4
Most devices connected 
to the computer communicate with the
processor to carry out a task. When a user
starts a program, for example, its instructions
transfer from a storage device to memory.
Data needed by programs enters memory
from either an input device or a storage
device. The control unit interprets and
executes instructions in memory, and the
ALU performs calculations on the data in
memory. Resulting information is stored in
memory, from which it can be sent to an
output device or a storage device for future
access, as needed.
The Control Unit
The control unit is the component of the processor that directs and coordinates most of the
operations in the computer. The control unit has a role much like a traffic cop: it interprets each
instruction issued by a program and then initiates the appropriate action to carry out the 
instruction. Types of internal components that the control unit directs include the arithmetic/logic
unit and buses, each discussed in this chapter.

C6672_CH04 pp3.qxd  1/30/08  1:30 PM  Page 137

The Arithmetic Logic Unit
The arithmetic logic unit (ALU), another component of the processor, performs arithmetic,
comparison, and other operations. Arithmetic operations include basic calculations such as addi-
tion, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Comparison operations involve comparing one
data item with another to determine whether the first item is greater than, equal to, or less than
the other item. Depending on the result of the comparison, different actions may occur. 
Machine Cycle
For every instruction, a processor repeats a set of four basic operations, which comprise a
machine cycle (Figure 4-5): (1) fetching, (2) decoding, (3) executing, and, if necessary, (4) storing.
Fetching is the process of obtaining a program instruction or data item from memory. The term
decoding refers to the process of translating the instruction into signals the computer can execute.
Executing is the process of carrying out the commands. Storing, in this context, means writing the
result to memory (not to a storage medium).

THE STEPS IN A MACHINE CYCLE
The System Clock
The processor relies on a small quartz crystal circuit called the system clock to control the 
timing of all computer operations. Just as your heart beats at a regular rate to keep your body
functioning, the system clock generates regular electronic pulses, or ticks, that set the operating
pace of components of the system unit.
The pace of the system clock, called the clock speed, is measured by the number of ticks per
second. Current personal computer processors have clock speeds in the gigahertz range. Giga is a

PROCESSOR
prefix that stands for billion, and a hertz is one cycle per second. Thus, one gigahertz
(GHz) equals one billion ticks of the system clock per second. A computer that oper-
ates at 3 GHz has 3 billion (giga) clock cycles in one second (hertz). The faster the
clock speed, the more instructions the processor can execute per second. The speed
of the system clock is just one factor that influences a computer’s performance. Other
factors, such as the type of processor chip, amount of cache, memory access time,
bus width, and bus clock speed, are discussed later in this chapter. Read Looking
Ahead 4-1 for a look at the future speeds of supercomputers.
Comparison of Personal Computer Processors
The leading processor chip manufacturers for personal computers are Intel, AMD
(Advanced Micro Devices), IBM, and Motorola. These manufacturers often identify
their processor chips by a model name or model number. 
With its earlier processors, Intel used a model number to identify the various
chips. After learning that processor model numbers could not be trademarked and
protected from use by competitors, Intel began identifying its processors with
names. Most high-performance desktop PCs today use a processor in the Intel Core
family. Less expensive, basic PCs today use a brand of Intel processor in the
Pentium or Celeron family. The Xeon and Itanium families of processors are ideal
for workstations and low-end servers.
AMD is the leading manufacturer of Intel-compatible processors, which have an
internal design similar to Intel processors, perform the same functions, and can be as
powerful, but often are less expensive. Intel and Intel-compatible processors are
used in PCs.
Originally, Apple computers used only an IBM processor or a Motorola processor,
which had a design different from the Intel-style processor. Today’s Apple comput-
ers, however, use Intel processors.
In the past, chip manufacturers listed a processor’s clock speed in marketing litera-
ture and advertisements. As previously mentioned, though, clock speed is only one
factor that impacts processing speed in today’s computers. To help consumers evalu-
ate various processors, manufacturers such as Intel and AMD now use a numbering 
scheme that more accurately reflects the processing speed of their chips.
Buying a Personal Computer
If you are ready to buy a new computer, the processor you select should depend on how you plan to use
the computer. If you purchase an IBM-compatible PC or Apple computer, you will choose an Intel processor
or, in some cases, an Intel-compatible processor.
For detailed computer purchasing guidelines, read the Buyer’s Guide feature that follows Chapter 7.

Discarded Computer Components: Whose Problem Is It?
Experts estimate that about 1 billion computers will be discarded by 2010. The discarded items often are known as e-waste. As technology
advances and prices fall, many people think of computers as disposable items. Computers contain several toxic elements, including lead, mer-
cury, and barium. Computers thrown into landfills or burned in incinerators can pollute the ground and the air. A vast amount of e-waste ends up
polluting third world countries. One solution is to recycle old computers. Some lawmakers prefer a more aggressive approach, such as setting up
a recycling program that would be paid for by adding a $10 fee to the purchase price of computers and computer equipment, or forcing computer
makers to be responsible for collecting and recycling their products. California already requires a recycling fee for any products sold that include 
old monitors and other equipment. Manufacturers have taken steps, such as offering to recycle old computers and using energy efficient and
environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques, but some claim that consumers should bear the responsibility of disposing of their old com-
puter parts. Several have reduced the amount of toxic material in their products, and manufacturers have set up their own recycling programs, 
for which users pay a fee. What can be done to ensure that computers are disposed of safely? Should government, manufacturers, or users be
responsible for safe disposal? Why? How can computer users be motivated to recycle obsolete equipment? How can society make it easier to
donate used equipment?

DATA REPRESENTATION
To understand fully the way a computer processes data, you should know how a computer 
represents data. Most computers are digital. They recognize only two discrete states: on and off.
The two digits, 0 and 1, easily can represent these two states (Figure 4-6). The digit 0 represents
the electronic state of off (absence of an electronic charge). The digit 1 represents the electronic
state of on (presence of an electronic charge).
The computer uses a binary system because it recognizes only two states. The binary system is a
number system that has just two unique digits, 0 and 1, called bits. A bit (short for binary digit) is
the smallest unit of data the computer can process. By itself, a bit is not
very informative.
When 8 bits are grouped together as a unit, they form a byte. A byte
provides enough different combinations of 0s and 1s to represent 256
individual characters. These characters include numbers, uppercase
and lowercase letters of the alphabet, punctuation marks, and others,
such as the letters of the Greek alphabet.
The combinations of 0s and 1s that represent characters are defined
by patterns called a coding scheme. In one coding scheme, the number
4 is represented as 00110100, the number 6 as 00110110, and the capital
letter E as 01000101 (Figure 4-7). Two popular coding schemes are
ASCII and EBCDIC (Figure 4-8). The American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII pronounced ASK-ee) scheme is the
most widely used coding system to represent data. Most personal com-
puters and servers use the ASCII coding
scheme. The Extended Binary Coded
Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC pro-
nounced EB-see-dik) scheme is used prima-
rily on mainframe computers and high-end
servers.

FIGURE 4-8
Two popular coding
schemes are ASCII and EBCDIC.
Coding schemes such as ASCII make it possible for
humans to interact with a digital computer that pro-
cesses only bits. When you press a key on a keyboard, a
chip in the keyboard converts the key’s electronic signal
into a scan code that is sent to the system unit. Then, 
the system unit converts the scan code into a binary
form the computer can process and is stored in memory.
Every character is converted to its corresponding byte.
The computer then processes the data as bytes, which
actually is a series of on/off electrical states. When 
processing is finished, software converts the byte into 
a human-recognizable number, letter of the alphabet, 
or special character that is displayed on a screen or is
printed (Figure 4-9). All of these conversions take place
so quickly that you do not realize they are occurring.
Standards, such as those defined by ASCII and EBCDIC,
also make it possible for components in computers to 
communicate successfully with each other.

MEMORY
Memory consists of electronic components that store instructions waiting to be executed by the
processor, data needed by those instructions, and the results of processed data (information).
Memory usually consists of one or more chips on the motherboard or some other circuit board in
the computer.
Memory stores three basic categories of items: (1) the operating system and other system soft-
ware that control or maintain the computer and its devices; (2) application programs that carry
out a specific task such as word processing; and (3) the data being processed by the application
programs and resulting information. This role of memory to store both data and programs is
known as the stored program concept.
Bytes and Addressable Memory
A byte (character) is the basic storage unit in
memory. When application program instructions
and data are transferred to memory from storage
devices, the instructions and data exist as bytes.
Each byte resides temporarily in a location in mem-
ory that has an address. An address simply is a
unique number that identifies the location of the
byte in memory. The illustration in Figure 4-10
shows how seats in an opera house are similar to
addresses in memory: (1) a seat, which is identified
by a unique seat number, holds one person at a
time, and a location in memory, which is identified
by a unique address, holds a single byte; and (2)
both a seat, identified by a seat number, and a byte,
identified by an address, can be empty. To access
data or instructions in memory, the computer 
references the addresses that contain bytes of data.
Memory Sizes
Manufacturers state the size of memory chips (Figure 4-11) and storage devices in terms of the
number of bytes the chip or device has available for storage. Recall that storage devices hold data,
instructions, and information for future use,
while most memory holds these items tem-
porarily. A kilobyte (KB or K) is equal to
exactly 1,024 bytes. To simplify memory and
storage definitions, computer users often round
a kilobyte down to 1,000 bytes. For example, if a
memory chip can store 100 KB, it can hold
approximately 100,000 bytes (characters). A
megabyte (MB) is equal to approximately 1
million bytes. A gigabyte (GB) equals approxi-
mately 1 billion bytes. A terabyte (TB) is equal
to approximately 1 trillion bytes.
Types of Memory
The system unit contains two types of memory: volatile and nonvolatile. When the computer’s
power is turned off, volatile memory loses its contents. Nonvolatile memory, by contrast, does
not lose its contents when power is removed from the computer. Thus, volatile memory is tempo-
rary and nonvolatile memory is permanent. RAM is the most common type of volatile memory.
Examples of nonvolatile memory include ROM, flash memory, and CMOS. The following sections
discuss these types of memory.

RAM
Users typically are referring to RAM when discussing computer memory. RAM (random access
memory), also called main memory, consists of memory chips that can be read from and written to
by the processor and other devices. When you turn on power to a computer, certain operating system
files (such as the files that determine how the Windows Vista desktop appears) load into RAM from a
storage device such as a hard disk. These files remain in RAM as long as the computer has continu-
ous power. As additional programs and data are requested, they also load into RAM from storage. 
The processor interprets and executes a program’s instructions while the program is in RAM.
During this time, the contents of RAM may change (Figure 4-12). RAM can hold multiple programs
simultaneously, provided the computer has enough RAM to accommodate all the programs. 
Most RAM is volatile, which means it loses its contents when the power is removed from the
computer. For this reason, you must save any items you may need in the future. Saving is the
process of copying items from RAM to a storage device such as a hard disk.

Step 1:
When you start the computer, certain 
operating system files are loaded into
RAM from the hard disk. The operating
system displays the user interface on
the screen.
Step 2:
When you start a Web browser, the 
program’s instructions are loaded into 
RAM from the hard disk. The Web

instructions are in RAM. The Web browser
window is displayed on the screen.
Step 3:
When you start a paint program, 
the program’s instructions are loaded 
into RAM from the hard disk. The paint 
program, along with the Web browser 
and certain operating system instructions, 
are in RAM. The paint program window 
is displayed on the screen.
Step 4:
When you quit a program, such as the 
Web browser, its program instructions are 
removed from RAM. The Web browser no 
longer is displayed on the screen.

Three basic types of RAM chips exist: dynamic
RAM, static RAM, and magnetoresistive RAM.
• Dynamic RAM (DRAM pronounced DEE-ram)
chips must be re-energized constantly or they lose
their contents. 
• Static RAM (SRAM pronounced ESS-ram) chips are
faster and more reliable than any variation of DRAM
chips. These chips do not have to be re-energized as
often as DRAM chips, thus, the term static. 
• A newer type of RAM, called magnetoresistive
RAM (MRAM pronounced EM-ram), stores data
using magnetic charges instead of electrical 
charges. Manufacturers claim that MRAM has
greater storage capacity, consumes less power, and
has faster access times than electronic RAM.
RAM chips usually reside on a memory module,
which is a small circuit board. Memory slots on the
motherboard hold memory modules (Figure 4-13). 
RAM CONFIGURATIONS
The amount of RAM necessary
in a computer often depends on the types of software you plan to use. A computer executes 
programs that are in RAM. The more RAM a computer has, the faster the computer will respond.
Retail software typically indicates the minimum amount of RAM it requires. If you want the 
software to perform optimally, usually you need more than the minimum specifications for
the software.
Generally, home users running Windows Vista and using basic application software such as word
processing should have at least 1 GB of RAM. Most business users who work with accounting, finan-
cial, or spreadsheet programs, and programs requiring multimedia capabilities should have 1 to 4 GB
of RAM. Users creating professional Web sites or using graphics-intensive applications will want 
4 GB or more of RAM. The amount of RAM in computers purchased today ranges from 1 GB to 
64 GB. Read Ethics & Issues 4-2 for a related discussion.
Cache
Most of today’s computers improve processing times with cache (pronounced cash). Two types
of cache are memory cache and disk cache. This chapter discusses memory cache.
Memory cache helps speed the processes of the computer because it stores frequently used
instructions and data. Most personal computers today have at least two types of memory 
cache: L1 cache and L2 cache.

Should Schools Supply Computers to All Students?
Around the country and around the world, local and national governments have begun to supply schoolchildren with inexpensive notebook 
computers. Many school districts in the United States purchase notebook computers for each student and hope to recoup some of the cost by pur-
chasing lower-cost CD-based textbooks. The United Nations endorses a plan known as One Laptop per Child to supply $100 notebook computers to
developing countries, some of which already pledged to purchase millions of the devices for schoolchildren. The device, which recharges with a
hand crank, includes Wi-Fi networking and a simple, intuitive user interface. Supporters of these plans maintain that computer literacy and electronic
communications are vital skills in today’s world, and students should be introduced to computers as early in their school years as possible. Others
claim that when students use notebook computers, instructors tend to lecture less, requiring students to engage in more research and independent
study. Many people oppose plans to equip every student with a computer because they say that the technology detracts from traditional educational
subjects, such as basic reading and math. They also point out the number of college instructors who ban the use of computers in the classroom.
The computers require maintenance, support, and instructional time to teach students how to use the devices. Young children may lack the respon-
sibility to care for and use the computers properly. Should schools supply computers to all students? Why or why not? What is the appropriate
grade level at which to require computer literacy? Why? Who should bear the cost of purchasing required computers for students? Why?

• L1 cache is built directly in the processor chip. L1 cache usually has a very small
capacity, ranging from 8 KB to 128 KB.
• L2 cache is slightly slower than L1 cache but has a much larger capacity, ranging
from 64 KB to 16 MB. Current processors include advanced transfer cache, a type
of L2 cache built directly on the processor chip. Processors that use advanced
transfer cache perform at much faster rates than those that do not use it. Personal
computers today typically have from 512 KB to 8 MB of advanced transfer cache.
Cache speeds up processing time because it stores frequently used instructions and
data. When the processor needs an instruction or data, it searches memory in this
order: L1 cache, then L2 cache, then RAM — with a greater delay in processing for
each level of memory it must search. If the instruction or data is not found in memory,
then it must search a slower speed storage medium such as a hard disk, CD, or DVD.
ROM
Read-only memory (ROM pronounced rahm) refers to memory chips storing permanent data and
instructions. The data on most ROM chips cannot be modified — hence, the name read-only. ROM is
nonvolatile, which means its contents are not lost when power is removed from the computer.
Manufacturers of ROM chips often record data, instructions, or information on the chips when
they manufacture the chips. These ROM chips, called firmware, contain permanently written
data, instructions, or information.
Flash Memory
Flash memory is a type of nonvolatile memory that can be erased electronically
and rewritten. Most computers use flash memory to hold their startup instructions
because it allows the computer easily to update its contents. For example, when the
computer changes from standard time to daylight savings time, the contents of a
flash memory chip (and the real-time clock chip) change to reflect the new time.
Flash memory chips also store data and programs on many mobile computers and
devices, such as smart phones, portable media players, PDAs, printers, digital cam-
eras, automotive devices, digital voice recorders, and pagers. Some portable media
players store music on flash memory chips (Figure 4-14). Others store music on tiny
hard disks or flash memory cards. A later section in this chapter discusses flash
memory cards, which contain flash memory on a removable device instead of a chip.

CMOS
Some RAM chips, flash memory chips, and other
types of memory chips use complementary metal-
oxide semiconductor (CMOS pronounced SEE-moss)
technology because it provides high speeds and con-
sumes little power. CMOS technology uses battery
power to retain information even when the power to
the computer is off. Battery-backed CMOS memory
chips, for example, can keep the calendar, date, and
time current even when the computer is off. The flash
memory chips that store a computer’s startup 
information often use CMOS technology.

Access time is the amount of time it takes the processor to read data, instructions, and information
from memory. A computer’s access time directly affects how fast the computer processes data.
Accessing data in memory can be more than 200,000 times faster than accessing data on a hard disk
because of the mechanical motion of the hard disk.
Today’s manufacturers use a variety of terminology to state access times (Figure 4-15). Some use
fractions of a second, which for memory occurs in nanoseconds. A nanosecond (abbreviated ns) is
one billionth of a second. A nanosecond is extremely fast (Figure 4-16). Other manufacturers state
access times in MHz; for example, 800 MHz RAM.
While access times of memory greatly affect overall computer performance, manufacturers and
retailers usually list a computer’s memory in terms of its size, not its access time.

EXPANSION SLOTS AND ADAPTER CARDS
An expansion slot is a socket on the motherboard that can hold an adapter card. An adapter card,
sometimes called an expansion card, is a circuit board that enhances functions of a component of
the system unit and/or provides connections to peripherals. A peripheral is a device that connects
to the system unit and is controlled by the processor in the computer. Examples of peripherals are
modems, disk drives, printers, scanners, and keyboards. 
Figure 4-17 lists a variety of types of adapter cards. Sometimes, all functionality is built into 
the adapter card. With others, a cable connects the adapter card to a device, such as a digital
video camera, outside the system unit. Figure 4-18 shows an adapter card being inserted in an
expansion slot on a personal computer motherboard.
Some motherboards include all necessary capabilities and do not require adapter cards. Other
motherboards may require adapter cards to provide capabilities such as sound and video. A
sound card enhances the sound-generating capabilities of a personal computer by allowing
sound to be input through a microphone and output through external speakers or headphones. A
video card, also called a graphics card, converts computer output into a video signal that travels
through a cable to the monitor, which displays an image on the screen.

Four widely used types of removable flash memory devices
include flash memory cards, USB flash drives, PC Cards, and
ExpressCard modules.
• A flash memory card is a removable flash memory device (Figure
4-19), usually no bigger than 1.5" in height or width, that you insert
and remove from a slot in a computer, mobile device, or card
reader/writer. Many mobile and consumer devices, such as smart
phones, digital cameras, portable media players, and PDAs use
these memory cards. Some printers and computers have built-in
card readers/writers or slots that read flash memory cards. In
addition, you can purchase an external card reader/writer that
attaches to any computer. The type of flash memory card you have
will determine the type of card reader/writer you need. Storage
capacities of flash memory cards range from 64 MB to 16 GB.

• A USB flash drive is a flash memory storage device that plugs in a USB port on a computer or
portable device. A special type of USB flash drive, called a U3 smart drive, includes preinstalled
software accessed through a Windows-type interface. (The next section discusses USB ports.)
Storage capacities of USB flash drives range from 256 MB to 64 GB, with the latter being
extremely expensive.
• Many computers have a PC Card slot or an
ExpressCard slot, which is a special type of
expansion slot that holds a PC Card or an
ExpressCard module, respectively. A PC Card
is a thin, credit card-sized removable flash
memory device that primarily is used today to
enable notebook computers to access the
Internet wirelessly. An ExpressCard module,
which can be used as a removable flash memory
device, is about one-half the size of a PC Card
and adds memory, communications, multi-
media, and security capabilities to computers
(Figure 4-20). 
PORTS AND CONNECTORS
A port is the point at which a peripheral attaches to or communicates with a system unit so that the 
peripheral can send data to or receive information from the computer. An external device, such as a
keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, and microphone, often attaches by a cable to a port on the system
unit. Instead of port, the term jack sometimes is used to identify audio and video ports. The front
and back of the system unit contain many ports (Figure 4-21).

A connector joins a cable to a port. A
connector at one end of a cable attaches to 
a port on the system unit, and a connector
at the other end of the cable attaches to a port 
on the peripheral.
Desktop personal computers may have 
a serial port, a parallel port, several USB
ports, and a FireWire port. The next section
discusses these and other ports.
Serial Ports
A serial port is a type of interface that 
connects a device to the system unit by 
transmitting data one bit at a time (Figure 
4-22). Serial ports usually connect devices 
that do not require fast data transmission rates,
such as a mouse, keyboard, or modem. The
COM port (short for communications port)
on the system unit is one type of serial port.
Parallel Ports
Unlike a serial port, a parallel port is an
interface that connects devices by transferring
more than one bit at a time (Figure 4-23).
Parallel ports originally were developed as 
an alternative to the slower speed serial ports.
Some printers can connect to the system unit
using a parallel port. This parallel port can
transfer eight bits of data (one byte) simul-
taneously through eight separate lines in a 
single cable.
USB Ports
A USB port, short for universal serial bus port,
can connect up to 127 different peripherals together
with a single connector. Devices that connect to a
USB port include the following: mouse, printer, 
digital camera, scanner, speakers, portable media
player, CD, DVD, smart phone, PDA, game console,
and removable hard disk. Personal computers typi-
cally have six to eight USB ports on the front and/or
back of the system unit (Figure 4-21). The latest ver-
sion of USB, called USB 2.0, is a more advanced and
faster USB, with speeds 40 times higher than that of
its predecessor.
To attach multiple peripherals using a single port,
you can use a USB hub. A USB hub is a device that
plugs in a USB port on the system unit and con-
tains multiple USB ports in which you plug cables
from USB devices. Some newer peripherals may
attach only to a USB port. Others attach to either a
serial or parallel port, as well as a USB port.

FireWire Ports
Previously called an IEEE 1394 port, a FireWire port is similar to a USB port in that it can connect
multiple types of devices that require faster data transmission speeds, such as digital video cam-
eras, digital VCRs, color printers, scanners, digital cameras, and DVD drives, to a single connector.
A FireWire port allows you to connect up to 63 devices together. The latest version, called FireWire
800, is much more advanced than the original FireWire. You can use a FireWire hub to attach mul-
tiple devices to a single FireWire port. A FireWire hub is a device that plugs in a FireWire port on
the system unit and contains multiple FireWire ports in which you plug cables from FireWire
devices. Ports such as USB and FireWire are replacing all other types of ports.

Why are some of my USB and FireWire cables different?
Some smaller computers and devices, such as digital cameras and game consoles, have a mini-USB or 
mini-FireWire port that requires the USB or FireWire cable have a mini connector at one end and a standard
connector at the other end to attach to the computer. Other devices, such as some smart phones, may require
the USB or FireWire cable have a device-specific connector at one end for special uses such as wireless Internet
connections. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch4/faq and then click USB and FireWire Cables.
Special-Purpose Ports
Five special-purpose ports are MIDI, eSATA, SCSI, IrDA, and Bluetooth. These ports are not
included in typical computers. For a computer to have these ports, you often must customize the
computer purchase order. The following sections discuss each of these ports.
MIDI PORT
A special type of serial port that connects the system unit to a musical instrument,
such as an electronic keyboard, is called a MIDI port. Short for Musical Instrument Digital
Interface, MIDI (pronounced MID-dee) is the electronic music industry’s standard that defines
how devices, such as sound cards and synthesizers, represent sounds electronically. A synthesizer,
which can be a peripheral or a chip, creates sound from digital instructions. A system unit with a
MIDI port has the capability of recording sounds that have been created by a synthesizer and
then processing the sounds (the data) to create new sounds. 
ESATA PORT
An eSATA port, or external SATA port, allows you to connect a high-speed
external SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) hard disk to a computer.
SCSI PORT
A special high-speed parallel port, called a SCSI port, allows you to attach SCSI
(pronounced skuzzy) peripherals such as disk drives and printers. SAS (serial-attached SCSI) is
a newer type of SCSI that transmits at much faster speeds than parallel SCSI. Some computers
include a SCSI port. Others have a slot that supports a SCSI card.
IRDA PORT
Some devices can transmit data via infrared light waves. For these wireless devices
to transmit signals to a computer, both the computer and the device must have an IrDA port.
To ensure nothing obstructs the path of the infrared light wave, you must align the IrDA port on the
device with the IrDA port on the computer, similarly to the way you operate a television remote con-
trol. Devices that use IrDA ports include a smart phone, PDA, keyboard, mouse, printer, and pager. 
BLUETOOTH PORT
An alternative to IrDA, Bluetooth technology uses radio waves to transmit
data between two devices. Unlike IrDA, the Bluetooth devices do not have to be aligned with
each other but they do have to be within about 33 feet of each other. Many computers, periph-
erals, smart phones, PDAs, cars, and other consumer electronics are Bluetooth-enabled, which
means they contain a small chip that allows them to communicate with other Bluetooth-enabled
computers and devices. If you have a computer that is not Bluetooth enabled, you can purchase
a Bluetooth wireless port adapter that will convert an existing USB port or serial port into a
Bluetooth port. Also available are Bluetooth PC Cards and ExpressCard modules for notebook
computers and Bluetooth cards for smart phones and PDAs.

C6672_CH04 pp3.qxd  1/30/08  1:30 PM  Page 150

BUSES
As explained earlier in this chapter, a computer processes and stores data as a
series of electronic bits. These bits transfer internally within the circuitry of the
computer along electrical channels. Each channel, called a bus, allows the vari-
ous devices both inside and attached to the system unit to communicate with
each other. Just as vehicles travel on a highway to move from one destina-
tion to another, bits travel on a bus (Figure 4-24).
Buses are used to transfer bits from input devices to memory, from memory
to the processor, from the processor to memory, and from memory to output or
storage devices. Buses consist of two parts: a data bus and an address bus. The
data bus is used to transfer actual data and the address bus is used to
transfer information about where the data should reside in memory.
The size of a bus, called the bus width, determines the
number of bits that the computer can transmit at one time.
For example, a 32-bit bus can transmit 32 bits (4 bytes) at a
time. On a 64-bit bus, bits transmit from one location to
another 64 bits (8 bytes) at a time. The larger the number
of bits handled by the bus, the faster the computer trans-
fers data. Most personal computers today use a 64-bit bus.
Every bus also has a clock speed. Just like the processor,
manufacturers state the clock speed for a bus in hertz.
Recall that one megahertz (MHz) is equal to one million ticks
per second. Most of today’s processors have a bus clock speed
of 400, 533, 667, 800, 1066, or 1333 MHz. The higher the bus clock
speed, the faster the transmission of data, which results in 
programs running faster.
A computer has two basic types of buses: a system bus and an
expansion bus. A system bus is part of the motherboard and connects
the processor to main memory. When computer professionals use the
term bus by itself, they usually are referring to the system bus.
An expansion bus allows the processor to communicate with 
peripherals. Some peripherals outside the system unit connect to
a port on an adapter card, which is inserted in an expansion slot
on the motherboard. This expansion slot connects to the expan-
sion bus, which allows the processor to communicate with the
peripheral attached to the adapter card.
BAYS
After you purchase a computer, you may want to install an 
additional storage device such as a disk drive in the system unit.
A bay is an opening inside the system unit in which you can
install additional equipment. A bay is different from a slot, which
is used for the installation of adapter cards. A drive bay is a rec-
tangular opening that typically holds disk drives. Other bays
house card readers and widely used ports such as USB, FireWire,
and audio ports.
An external bay allows a user to access openings in the bay from
outside the system unit (Figure 4-25). CD drives and DVD drives
are examples of devices installed in external bays. An 
internal bay is concealed entirely within the system 
unit. Hard disk drives are installed in internal bays.

POWER SUPPLY
Many personal computers plug in standard wall outlets, which supply an alternating current (AC)
of 115 to 120 volts. This type of power is unsuitable for use with a computer, which requires a
direct current (DC) ranging from 5 to 12 volts. The power supply is the component of the system
unit that converts the wall outlet AC power into DC power. 
Some external peripherals such as a cable modem, speakers, or a printer have an AC adapter,
which is an external power supply. One end of the AC adapter plugs in the wall outlet and the
other end attaches to the peripheral. The AC adapter converts the AC power into DC power that
the peripheral requires.
MOBILE COMPUTERS AND DEVICES
As businesses and schools expand to serve people across the country and around the world,
increasingly more people need to use a computer while traveling to and from a main office or
school to conduct business, communicate, or do homework. Users with such mobile computing
needs often have a mobile computer, such as a notebook computer or Tablet PC, or a mobile
device such as a smart phone, PDA, or portable media player (Figure 4-26). 
Weighing on average from 2.5 to more than 10 pounds, notebook computers can run either
using batteries or using a standard power supply. Smaller smart phones and PDAs run strictly 
on batteries. Like their desktop counterparts, mobile computers and devices have a motherboard
that contains electronic components that process data.

A notebook computer usually is more expensive than a desktop computer with the same 
capabilities because it is more costly to miniaturize the components. Notebook computers may
have video, modem, network, FireWire, USB, headphones, and microphone ports (Figure 4-27).
Some mobile users prefer connecting peripherals to a port replicator. A port replicator, which is
an external device that attaches to a mobile computer, provides connections to peripherals
through ports built into the replicator. 
Two basic designs of Tablet PC are available: slate and convertible. With the slate Tablet PC
(shown in Figure 4-1 on page 134), all hardware is behind the display — much like a smart phone
or PDA. Users can attach a removable keyboard to the slate Tablet PC. The display on the con-
vertible Tablet PC, which is attached to a keyboard, can be rotated 180 degrees and folded down
over the keyboard. Tablet PCs usually include several slots and ports (Figure 4-28). 
Smart phones, portable music players, and PDAs are quite affordable, usually priced at a few
hundred dollars or less. These mobile devices often have an IrDA port or are Bluetooth enabled so
that users can communicate wirelessly with other computers or devices such as a printer.

KEEPING YOUR COMPUTER CLEAN
Over time, the system unit collects dust — even in a clean environment. Built up dust can block
airflow in the computer, which can cause it to overheat, corrode, or even stop working. By clean-
ing your computer once or twice a year, you can help extend its life. This preventive maintenance
requires a few basic products (Figure 4-30):
• can of compressed air — removes dust and lint from difficult-to-reach areas
• lint-free antistatic wipes and swabs
• bottle of rubbing alcohol
• small computer vacuum (or small attachments on your house vacuum)
• antistatic wristband — to avoid damaging internal components with static electricity
• small screwdriver (may be required to open the case or remove adapter cards)
Before cleaning the computer, turn it off, unplug it from the electrical outlet, and unplug all
cables from the ports. Blow away any dust from all openings on the computer case, such as
drives, slots, and ports. Vacuum the power supply fan on the back of the computer case to
remove any dust that has accumulated on it. Next, release short blasts of compressed air on the
power supply fan. Then, use an antistatic wipe to clean the exterior of the case.
If you need assistance opening the computer case, refer to the instructions that came with the
computer. Before opening the case, though, check with the computer manufacturer to be sure you
will not void a warranty. Once the case is open, put the antistatic wristband on your wrist and
attach its clip to the case of the computer. Use the antistatic wipes to clean dust and grime inside
the walls of the computer case.
Vacuum as much dust as
possible from the interior
of the case, including the
wires, chips, adapter
cards, and fan blades.
Next, release short blasts
of compressed air in areas
the vacuum cannot reach.
If the motherboard and
adapter cards still look
dirty, gently clean them
with lint-free wipes or
swabs lightly dampened
with alcohol.
When finished, be sure
all adapter cards are set
tightly in their expansion
slots. Then close the case,
plug in all cables, and
attach the power cord.
Write down the date you
cleaned the computer so
that you have a record for
your next cleaning.
If you do not feel com-
fortable cleaning the sys-
tem unit yourself, have a
local computer company
clean it for you.

Computer Engineer
A computer engineer designs and develops the electronic components
found in computers and peripheral devices. They also can work as
researchers, theorists, and inventors. Companies may hire computer engi-
neers for permanent positions or as consultants, with jobs that extend from
a few months to a few years, depending on the project. Engineers in research
and development often work on projects that will not be released to the general
public for two years.
Responsibilities vary from company to company. All computer engineering work, however, demands 
problem-solving skills and the ability to create and use new technologies. The ability to handle multiple
tasks and concentrate on detail is a key component. Assignments often are taken on as part of a team.
Therefore, computer engineers must be able to communicate clearly with both computer personnel and
computer users, who may have little technical knowledge.
Before taking in-depth computer engineering design and development classes, students usually take
mathematics, physics, and basic engineering. Computer engineering degrees include B.S., M.S., and Ph.D.
Because computer engineers employed in private industry often advance into managerial positions, many
computer engineering graduates obtain a master’s degree in business administration (M.B.A.). Most com-
puter engineers earn between $70,000 and $115,000 annually, depending on their experience and employer,
but salaries can exceed $150,000. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch4/careers and then click

AMD
PC Processor Supplier
Customer needs influence the integrated circuits Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) develops
for the computing, communications, and consumer electronics industries. AMD calls this
philosophy “customer-centric innovation.”
As a global supplier of PC processors, AMD engineers its technologies at its Submicron
Development Center (SDC) in Sunnyvale, California. The technologies are put into production
at manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Japan.
Among the company’s more successful line of processors is the AMD 64 family, which
is composed of the AMD Athlon 64 processor for desktop and personal computers, the
AMD Opteron processor for servers and workstations, and the AMD Turion mobile tech-
nology for notebook computers. The company’s CoolCore Technology, which saves energy
by turning off blocks of memory when not in use, and Barcelona quad-core processors
were introduced in 2007. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch4/companies and
then click AMD.
Intel
Chip Maker Dominates the Computer Market
When Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce started Intel in 1968, their goal was to replace
magnetic core memory with semiconductor memory. Noyce and Moore, together with 
Andy Grove, refined the process of placing thousands of tiny electronic devices on a 
silicon chip. In 1971, the company introduced the Intel 4004, the first single-chip
microprocessor.
When IBM chose the Intel 8008 chip for its new personal computer in 1980, Intel chips
became standard for all IBM-compatible personal computers. Today, Intel’s microproces-
sors are the building blocks in countless personal computers, servers, networks, and
communications devices. The company in 2007 joined the One Laptop per Child initiative,
which plans to equip children in third-world countries with notebook computers that cost
approximately $100. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch4/companies and then

Jack Kilby
Integrated Circuit Inventor
Jack Kilby was awarded more than 60 patents during his lifetime, but one has changed the world. His integrated circuit, or
microchip, invention made microprocessors possible. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 2000 for his part in the
invention of the integrated circuit.
Kilby started his work with miniature electrical components at Centralab, where he developed transistors for hearing aids.
He then took a research position with Texas Instruments and developed a working model of the first integrated circuit, which
was patented in 1959. Kilby applied this invention to various industrial, military, and commercial applications, including the
first pocket calculator, called the Pocketronic.
Kilby is considered one of the more influential people in the world who has had the greatest impact on business computing
in the past 50 years. Kilby died in 2005, but his legacy lives on. His first circuit has fostered a worldwide integrated circuit mar-
ket with sales of nearly $200 billion annually. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch4/people and then click Jack Kilby.
Gordon Moore
Intel Cofounder
More than 40 years ago, Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors and resistors placed on computer chips would
double every year, with a proportional increase in computing power and decrease in cost. This bold forecast, now known as
Moore’s Law, proved amazingly accurate for 10 years. Then, Moore revised the estimate to doubling every two years.
Convinced of the future of silicon chips, Moore cofounded Intel in 1968. Moore’s lifelong interest in technology was kindled
at an early age when he experimented with a neighbor’s chemistry set. Even then, he displayed the passion for practical 
outcomes that has typified his work as a scientist and engineer.
The San Jose Tech Museum of Innovation honored Moore in 2007 with its Global Humanitarian Award for the more than
$1 billion donated by his Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch4/people and

Chapter Review
The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students regarding
any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch4/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
How Are Various Styles of System Units Different?
The system unit is a case that contains electronic components of the computer used to process data. On desktop personal
computers, most storage devices also are part of the system unit. On notebook computers, the keyboard and pointing
device often occupy the area on top of the system unit, and the display attaches to the system unit by hinges. On mobile
computers and devices, the display often is built into the system unit. With game consoles, the input and output devices,
such as controllers and a television, reside outside the system unit. On handheld game consoles and portable media
players, by contrast, the packaging around the system unit also houses the input devices and display.
What Are the Components of a Processor, and How Do They Complete a Machine Cycle?
The processor interprets and carries out the basic instructions that operate a computer. Processors contain a control unit
that directs and coordinates most of the operations in the computer and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs
arithmetic, comparison, and other operations. The machine cycle is a set of four basic operations — fetching, decoding,
executing, and storing — that the processor repeats for every instruction. The control unit fetches program instructions
and data from memory and decodes the instructions into commands the computer can execute. The ALU executes the
commands, and the results are stored in memory.
What Is a Bit, and How Does a Series of Bits Represent Data?
Most computers are digital and recognize only two discrete states: off and on. To represent these two states, computers
use the binary system, which is a number system that has just two unique digits — 0 (for off) and 1 (for on) — called bits.
A bit is the smallest unit of data a computer can process. Grouped together as a unit, 8 bits form a byte, which provides
enough different combinations of 0s and 1s to represent 256 individual characters. The combinations are defined by
patterns, called coding schemes, such as ASCII and EBCDIC.
What Are the Various Types of Memory?
The system unit contains volatile and nonvolatile memory. Volatile memory loses its contents when the computer’s
power is turned off. Nonvolatile memory does not lose its contents when the computer’s power is turned off. RAM is 
the most common type of volatile memory. ROM, flash memory, and CMOS are examples of nonvolatile memory. RAM
consists of memory chips that can be read from and written to by the processor and other devices. ROM refers to memory
chips storing permanent data and instructions that usually cannot be modified. Flash memory can be erased electronically
and rewritten. CMOS technology uses battery power to retain information even when the power to the computer is
turned off.
What Are the Types of Expansion Slots and Adapter Cards?
An expansion slot is a socket on the motherboard that
can hold an adapter card. An adapter card is a circuit
board that enhances functions of a component of 
the system unit and/or provides a connection to a
peripheral such as a modem, disk drive, printer,
scanner, or keyboard. Several types of adapter cards
exist. A sound card enhances the sound-generating
capabilities of a personal computer. A video card,
also called a graphics card, converts computer
output into a video signal that displays an image 
on the screen.

How Are a Serial Port, a Parallel Port, a USB Port, and Other Ports Different?
A port is the point at which a peripheral attaches to or communicates with a system unit so that the peripheral can send
data to or receive information from the computer. A serial port, which transmits data one bit at a time, usually connects
devices that do not require fast data transmission, such as a mouse, keyboard, or modem. A parallel port, which transfers
more than one bit at a time, sometimes connects a printer to the system unit. A USB port can connect up to 127 different
peripherals together with a single connector. A FireWire port can connect multiple types of devices that require faster data
transmission speeds. Five special-purpose ports are MIDI, eSATA, SCSI, IrDA, and Bluetooth. A MIDI port connects the
system unit to a musical instrument. An eSATA port connects a high-speed external SATA hard disk to a computer. A SCSI
port attaches the system unit to SCSI peripherals, such as disk drives. An IrDA port and Bluetooth technology allow 
wireless devices to transmit signals to a computer via infrared light waves or radio waves.
How Do Buses Contribute to a Computer’s Processing Speed?
A bus is an electrical channel along which bits transfer within the circuitry of a computer, allowing devices both inside
and attached to the system unit to communicate. The size of a bus, called the bus width, determines the number of bits
that the computer can transmit at one time. The larger the bus width, the faster the computer transfers data.
What Are the Components in Mobile Computers and Mobile Devices?
Mobile computers and devices have a motherboard that contains electronic components that process data. The system unit
for a typical notebook computer often has video, modem, network, FireWire, USB, headphones, and microphone ports.
Tablet PCs usually include several slots and ports. Smart phones, portable music players, and PDAs often have an IrDA
port or are Bluetooth enabled so that users can communicate wirelessly.
How Do You Clean a System Unit?
Before cleaning a system unit, turn off the computer and unplug it from the wall. Use a small vacuum and a can of 
compressed air to remove external dust. After opening the case, wear an antistatic wristband and vacuum the interior.
Wipe away dust and grime using lint-free antistatic wipes and rubbing alcohol.

Learn How To
Use the Learn How To activities to learn fundamental skills when using a computer and accompanying technology. Complete
the exercises and submit them to your instructor.
LEARN HOW TO 1: Purchase and Install Memory in a Computer
One of the less expensive and more effective ways to speed up a computer, make it capable of processing more programs at the
same time, and enable it to handle graphics, gaming, and other high-level programs is to increase the amount of memory. The
process of increasing memory is accomplished in two phases — purchasing the memory and installing the memory. To purchase
memory for a computer, complete the following steps:
1. Determine the amount of memory currently in the computer. For a method to do this, see Learn How To number 3 in Chapter 3.
2. Determine the maximum amount of memory your computer can contain. This value can change for different computers, based
primarily on the number of slots on the motherboard available for memory and the size of the memory modules you can place
in each slot. On most computers, different size memory modules can be inserted in slots. A computer, therefore, might allow a
128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, 1 GB, or 2 GB memory module to be inserted in each slot. To determine the maximum memory for a
computer, in many cases you can multiply the number of memory slots on the computer by the maximum size memory module
that can be inserted in each slot.
For example, if a computer contains four memory slots and is able to accept memory modules of 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, or
1 GB in each of its memory slots, the maximum amount of memory the computer can contain is 4 GB (4 x 1 GB).
You can find the number of slots and the allowable sizes of each memory module by contacting the computer manufacturer,
looking in the computer’s documentation, or contacting sellers of memory such as Kingston (www.kingston.com) or Crucial
(www.crucial.com) on the Web. These sellers have documentation for most computers, and even programs you can download
to run on your computer that will specify how much memory your computer currently has and how much you can add.
3. Determine how much memory you want to add, which will be somewhere between the current memory and the maximum
memory allowed on the computer. 
4. Determine the current configuration of memory on the computer. For example, if a computer with four memory slots contains 
512 MB of memory, it could be using one memory module of 512 MB in a single slot and the other three slots would be empty;
two memory modules of 256 MB each in two slots with two slots empty; one memory module of 256 MB and two memory
modules of 128 MB each in three slots with one slot empty; or four memory modules of 128 MB each in four slots with no slots
empty. You may be required to look inside the system unit to make this determination. The current memory configuration on
a computer will determine what new memory modules you should buy to increase the memory to the amount determined
in Step 3.
You also should be aware that a few computers require memory to be installed in the computer in matching pairs. This
means that a computer with four slots could obtain 512 MB of memory with two memory modules of 256 MB each in two
slots, or four memory modules of 128 MB each in four slots.
5. Determine the number of available memory slots on your computer and the number and size memory modules you must 
buy to fulfill your requirement. Several scenarios can occur (in the following examples, assume you can install memory one
module at a time).
a. Scenario 1: The computer has one or more open slots. In this case, you might be able to purchase a memory module that
matches the amount of memory increase you desire. For example, if you want to increase memory by 256 MB, you should
purchase a 256 MB memory module for insertion in the open slot. Generally, you should buy the maximum size module
you can for an open slot. So, if you find two empty slots and wish to increase memory by 256 MB, it is smarter to buy one
256 MB module and leave one empty slot rather than buy two 128 MB memory modules and use both slots. This allows
you to increase memory again without removing currently used modules.
b. Scenario 2: The computer has no open slots. For example, a computer containing 512 MB of memory could have four slots
each containing 128 MB memory modules. If you want to increase the memory on the computer to 1 GB, you will have to
remove some of the 128 MB memory modules and replace them with the new memory modules you purchase. In this
example, you want to increase the memory by 512 MB. You would have several options: (1) You could replace all four 
128 MB memory modules with 256 MB memory modules; (2) You could replace all four 128 MB memory modules with two
512 MB memory modules; (3) You could replace one 128 MB memory module with a 512 MB memory module, and replace a
second 128 MB module with a 256 MB memory module. Each of these options results in a total memory of 1 GB. The best
option will depend on the price of memory and whether you anticipate increasing the memory size at a later time. The least
expensive option probably would be number 3.

Learn How To
163
c.
Scenario 3: Many other combinations can occur. You may have to perform arithmetic calculations to decide the
combination of memory modules that will work for the number of slots on the computer and the desired additional
memory.
6. Determine the type of memory to buy for the computer. Computer memory has many types and configurations, and it is
critical that you buy the kind of memory for which the computer was designed. It is preferable to buy the same type of
memory that currently is found in the computer. That is, if the memory is DDR3 SDRAM with a certain clock speed, then that
is the type of additional memory you should place in the computer. The documentation for the computer should specify the
memory type. In addition, the Web sites cited on the previous page, and others as well, will present a list of memory modules
that will work with your computer. Enough emphasis cannot be placed on the fact that the memory you buy must be
compatible with the type of memory usable on your computer. Because there are so many types and configurations, you must
be especially diligent to ensure you purchase the proper memory for your computer.
7. Once you have determined the type and size of memory to purchase, buy it from a reputable dealer. Buying poor or
mismatched memory is a major reason for a computer’s erratic performance and is one of the more difficult problems to
troubleshoot.
After purchasing the memory, you must install it on your computer. Complete the following steps to install memory on 
a computer:
1. Unplug the computer, and remove all electrical cords and device cables from the ports on the computer. Open the case of 
the system unit. You may want to consult the computer’s documentation to determine the exact procedure for opening the
system unit.
2. Ground yourself so that you do not generate static electricity that can cause memory or other components within the system
unit to be damaged. To do this, wear an antistatic wristband you can purchase inexpensively in a computer or electronics
store; or, before you touch any component within the system unit, touch an unpainted metal surface such as the metal on the
back of the computer. If you are not wearing an antistatic wristband, periodically touch an unpainted metal surface to
dissipate any static electricity.
3. Within the system unit, find the memory slots on the motherboard. The easiest way to do this is look for memory modules
that are similar to those you purchased. The memory slots often are located near the processor. If you cannot find the slots,
consult the documentation. A diagram often is available to help you spot the memory slots.
4. Insert the memory module in the next empty slot. Orient the memory module in the slot to match the modules currently
installed. A notch or notches on the memory module will ensure you do not install the module backwards. If your memory
module is a DIMM, insert the module straight down into grooves on the clips and then apply gentle pressure to seat the
modules properly (see Figure 4-13 on page 144). If your memory is SIMM, which is used on older computers, insert the
module at a 45 degree angle and then rotate it to a vertical position until the module snaps into place.
5. If you must remove one or more memory modules before inserting the new memory, carefully release the clips before lifting
the memory module out of the memory slot.
6. Plug in the machine and replace all the device cables without replacing the cover.
7. Start the computer. In most cases, the new memory will be recognized and the computer will run normally. If an error
message appears, determine the cause of the error. In most cases, if you turn off the computer, remove the chords and cables,
ground yourself, and then reinstall the memory, everything will be fine.
8. Replace the computer cover.
Adding memory to a computer can extend its usefulness and increase its processing power.

KEYBOARD AND POINTING DEVICES
Two of the more widely used input devices are the keyboard and the mouse. Most computers
include a keyboard or keyboarding capabilities.
The mouse is a pointing device because it allows a user to control a pointer on the screen. In 
a graphical user interface, a pointer is a small symbol on the screen whose location and shape
change as a user moves a pointing device. A pointing device can select text, graphics, and other
objects; and click buttons, icons, links, and menu commands.
The following pages discuss the keyboard and a variety of pointing devices.

The Keyboard
Many people use a keyboard as one of their input devices. A keyboard is an input device that
contains keys users press to enter data and instructions into a computer (Figure 5-2).
All computer keyboards have a typing area that includes the letters of the alphabet, numbers,
punctuation marks, and other basic keys. Many desktop computer keyboards also have a numeric
keypad on the right side of the keyboard. 
Most of today’s desktop computer keyboards are enhanced keyboards. An enhanced keyboard has
12 or more function keys along the top and a set of arrow and additional keys between the typing
area and the numeric keypad (Figure 5-2). Function keys are special keys programmed to issue
commands to a computer.
Keyboards with media control buttons allow you to control your media player program, access
the computer’s CD/DVD drive, and adjust speaker volume. Internet controls allow you to open an
e-mail program, start a Web browser, and search the Internet. Some keyboards include buttons and
other features specifically for users that enjoy playing games on the computer.
Desktop computer keyboards often attach via a cable to a serial port, a keyboard port,
or a USB port on the system unit. Some keyboards, however, do not have any wires
connecting the keyboard to the system unit. A wireless keyboard, or cordless keyboard,
is a battery-powered device that transmits data using wireless technology, such as radio
waves or infrared light waves. Wireless keyboards often communicate with a receiver
attached to a port on the system unit.
On notebook and some handheld computers, smart phones, and other mobile devices,
the keyboard is built in the top of the system unit. To fit in these smaller computers and
devices, the keyboards usually are smaller and have fewer keys. On many smart phones,
for example, each key represents multiple characters, which are identified on the key.
Regardless of size, many keyboards have a rectangular shape with the keys aligned
in straight, horizontal rows. Users who spend a lot of time typing on these keyboards
sometimes experience repetitive strain injuries (RSI) of their wrists and hands. For this
reason, some manufacturers offer ergonomic keyboards. An ergonomic keyboard has a
design that reduces the chance of wrist and hand injuries. 
The goal of ergonomics is to incorporate comfort, efficiency, and safety in the design of
the workplace. Employees can be injured or develop disorders of the muscles, nerves, 
tendons, ligaments, and joints from working in an area that is not ergonomically designed.

What can I do to reduce
chances of experiencing
repetitive strain injuries?
Do not rest your wrist on the edge of a
desk; use a wrist rest. Keep your forearm
and wrist level so that your wrist does not
bend. Take a break and do hand exercises
every 15 minutes. Keep your shoulders,
arms, hands, and wrists relaxed while you
work. Maintain good posture. Keep feet
flat on the floor, with one foot slightly in
front of the other. Immediately stop using
the computer if you begin to experience
pain or fatigue. For more information, visit

Are Employers Responsible for Medical Problems Related to Computer Use?
When you consider the causes of workplace injuries, you might not put clicking a mouse or using a cell phone in the same category with lifting a
bag of concrete, but perhaps you should. According to the chairman of a National Academy of Sciences panel that investigated workplace injuries,
every year one million Americans lose workdays because of repetitive strain injuries, including the latest malady known as cell phone elbow.
Repetitive strain injuries are caused when muscle groups perform the same actions over and over again. Once, repetitive strain injuries were
common among factory workers who performed the same tasks on an assembly line for hours a day. Today, these injuries, which often result
from prolonged use of a computer mouse and keyboard or overuse of cell phones and other personal mobile devices, are the largest job-related
injury and illness problem in the United States and are almost completely avoidable with proper computer and mobile device use. OSHA proposed
standards whereby employers would have to establish programs to prevent workplace injuries with respect to computer use. Yet, Congress
rejected the standards, accepting the argument that the cost to employers would be prohibitive and unfair. Some argue that it is each employee’s
responsibility to be aware of preventative measures against repetitive strain injuries. Should the government establish laws regarding computer
use? Why or why not? Are employees, employers, or the government responsible for repetitive strain injuries? Why? Who should be responsible
for the costs of prevention and medical care? Why?

The top and sides of a mouse have one to four buttons; some also have a small wheel.
Mouse
A mouse is a pointing device that fits comfortably under the palm of your hand. With a mouse,
users control the movement of the pointer. As you move a mouse, the pointer on the screen also
moves. Generally, you use the mouse to move the pointer on the screen to an object such as a but-
ton, a menu, an icon, a link, or text. Then, you press a mouse button to perform a certain action
associated with that object.
A mechanical mouse, which was the first type of mouse used with personal computers, has a 
rubber or metal ball on its underside. Electronic circuits in the mouse translate the movement of the
mouse into signals the computer can process. A mechanical mouse is placed on a mouse pad, which is
a rectangular rubber or foam pad that provides better traction than the top of a desk. 
Most computer users today have some type of optical mouse, which has no moving mechanical parts
inside. Instead, an optical mouse uses devices that emit and sense light to detect the mouse’s movement.
Some use optical sensors, and others use a laser (Figure 5-3a). The latter type often is referred to as a laser
mouse, which usually is more expensive than the former. An optical mouse is more precise than a mechan-
ical mouse and does not require cleaning as does a mechanical mouse, but it also is more expensive.
The mobile user who makes presentations may prefer a mouse that has additional buttons on the
bottom for running a slide show and controlling media, similar to a remote control. An air mouse is a
newer type of motion-sensing mouse that, in addition to the typical buttons, allows you to control
objects, media players, and slide shows by moving the mouse in predetermined directions through the
air (Figure 5-3b). For example, raising the mouse up would increase the volume on your media player.
A mouse connects to a computer in several ways. Many types connect with a cable that attaches 
to a serial port, mouse port, or USB port on the system unit. A wireless mouse, or cordless mouse, 
is a battery-powered device that transmits data using wireless technology, such as radio waves or
infrared light waves. Read Ethics & Issues 5-1 for a related discussion.

C6672_CH05 pp4.qxd  1/30/08  2:10 PM  Page 169

Trackball
A trackball is a stationary pointing device with a 
ball on its top or side (Figure 5-4). To move the pointer
using a trackball, you rotate the ball with your thumb,
fingers, or the palm of your hand. In addition to the
ball, a trackball usually has one or more buttons that
work just like mouse buttons.
Touchpad
A touchpad is a small, flat, rectangular pointing 
device that is sensitive to pressure and motion (Figure
5-5). To move the pointer using a touchpad, slide your
fingertip across the surface of the pad. Some touch-
pads have one or more buttons around the edge of the
pad that work like mouse buttons. On most touch-
pads, you also can tap the pad’s surface to imitate
mouse operations such as clicking. Touchpads are
found most often on notebook computers.
Pointing Stick
A pointing stick is a pressure-sensitive pointing
device shaped like a pencil eraser that is positioned
between keys on a keyboard (Figure 5-6). To move
the pointer using a pointing stick, you push the
pointing stick with a finger. The pointer on the screen
moves in the direction you push the pointing stick. By
pressing buttons below the keyboard, users can click
and perform other mouse-type operations with a 
pointing stick. 
Light Pen
A light pen is a handheld input device that can
detect the presence of light. To select objects on the
screen, a user presses the light pen against the sur-
face of the screen or points the light pen at the screen
and then presses a button on the pen.
Touch Screen
A touch screen is a touch-sensitive display device.
Users can interact with these devices by touching
areas of the screen. Because touch screens require 
a lot of arm movements, you do not enter large
amounts of data using a touch screen. Instead, users
touch words, pictures, numbers, letters, or locations
identified on the screen. 
With some smart phones, portable media players,
and other personal mobile devices, you can touch the screen to perform tasks such as dialing tele-
phone numbers, entering text, and making on-screen selections. Many handheld game consoles also
have touch screens. Kiosks, which are freestanding computers, have touch screens (Figure 5-7).

A recently developed touch screen, called Microsoft Surface, is a
30-inch tabletop display that allows one or more people to interact
with the screen using their fingers or hands (Figure 5-8). The
Microsoft Surface display also allows devices that are not digital, 
such as an everyday paintbrush, to be used as an input device.
Pen Input
Mobile users often enter data and instructions with a pen-type device. With pen input, users
write, draw, and tap on a flat surface to enter input. The surface may be a monitor, a screen, a
special type of paper, or a graphics tablet. Two devices used for pen input are the stylus and digi-
tal pen. A stylus is a small metal or plastic device that looks like a tiny ink pen but uses pressure
instead of ink. A digital pen, which is slightly larger than a stylus, is available in two forms:
some are pressure-sensitive; others have built-in digital cameras.
Some mobile computers and nearly all mobile devices have touch screens that recognize pen
input. Instead of using a finger to enter data and instructions, most of these devices include a
pressure-sensitive digital pen or stylus. You write, draw, or make selections on the screen by
touching it with the pen or stylus. For example, Tablet PCs use a pressure-sensitive digital pen
and many smart phones and other personal mobile devices use a stylus. Pressure-sensitive digital
pens, often simply called pens, typically provide more
functionality than a stylus, featuring electronic erasers
and programmable buttons.
Pen input is possible on computers without touch
screens by attaching a graphics tablet to the computer.
A graphics tablet is a flat, rectangular, electronic, plastic
board. Architects, mapmakers, designers, artists, and
home users create drawings and sketches by using a
pressure-sensitive pen on a graphics tablet (Figure 5-9).
Digital pens that have built-in digital cameras work
differently from pressure-sensitive digital pens. These
pens look very much like a ballpoint pen and typically
do not contain any additional buttons. As you write or
draw on special digital paper with the pen, it captures
every handwritten mark and then stores the images in
the pen’s memory. You then can transfer the images
from the pen to a computer or mobile device, such as a
smart phone.

GAMING AND MEDIA PLAYER CONTROLLERS
Video games and computer games use a game controller as the input
device that directs movements and actions of on-screen objects (Figure
5-10). Game controllers include gamepads, joysticks and wheels, light
guns, dance pads, and a variety of motion-sensing controllers. Portable
media players use a touch-sensitive pad as their input device.
Gamepads
A gamepad, which is held with both hands, controls the movement
and actions of players or objects in video games or computer games. On
the gamepad, users press buttons with their thumbs or move sticks in
various directions to trigger events. Gamepads communicate with a
game console or a personal computer via wired or wireless technology.
Joysticks and Wheels
Users running game software or flight and driving simulation software
often use a joystick or wheel to control an airplane, vehicle, or player. A
joystick is a handheld vertical lever mounted on a base. You move the
lever in different directions and press buttons to control the actions of the
simulated vehicle or player. A wheel is a steering-wheel-type input device
that you turn to simulate driving a car, truck, or other vehicle. Most wheels
also include foot pedals for acceleration and braking actions. Joysticks and
wheels typically attach via a cable to a personal computer or game console.
Light Guns
A light gun is used to shoot targets and moving objects after you pull the trigger on the weapon.
Light guns typically attach via a cable to a game console or personal computer.
Dance Pads
A dance pad is a flat electronic device divided into panels that users press with their feet in response to
instructions from a music video game. These games test the user’s ability to step on the correct panel at
the correct time, following a pattern that is synchronized with the rhythm or beat of a song. Dance pads
communicate with a game console or a personal computer via wired or wireless technology.
Motion-Sensing Game Controllers
Motion-sensing game controllers allow the user to guide on-screen elements by moving a handheld
input device in predetermined directions through the air. Sports games, for example, use motion-sensing
game controllers, such as baseball bats and golf clubs, as their input device. These types of controllers 
communicate with a game console or a personal computer via wired or wireless technology.
A popular general-purpose, motion-sensing game controller is Nintendo’s Wii Remote. Shaped like a 
television remote control and operated with one hand, the Wii Remote is a motion-sensing input device
that uses Bluetooth wireless technology to communicate with the Wii game console. Users point the Wii
Remote in different directions and rotate it to control on-screen players, vehicles, and other objects.
Touch-Sensitive Pads
The touch-sensitive pad on a portable media player is an
input device that enables users to scroll through and play
music, view pictures, watch videos or movies, adjust vol-
ume, and customize settings. Touch-sensitive pads typically
contain buttons and/or wheels that are operated with a
thumb or finger. For example, users rotate a Click Wheel
to browse through its song, picture, or movie lists and press
the Click Wheel’s buttons to play or pause media, display a
menu, and other actions (Figure 5-11).

OTHER TYPES OF INPUT
In addition to the keyboard, mouse, and pointing
devices just discussed, users have a variety of other
options available to enter data and instructions into a
computer. These include voice input; input for smart
phones, PDAs, and Tablet PCs; digital cameras; video
input; scanners and reading devices; terminals; and
biometric input. Read Looking Ahead 5-1 for a look at
the next generation of input devices.
Voice Input
Voice input is the process of entering input by 
speaking into a microphone. Uses of voice input 
include instant messaging that supports voice conver-
sations, chat rooms that support voice chats, VoIP, and
voice recognition. Recall that VoIP (Voice over IP)
enables users to speak to other users over the Internet.
Voice recognition, also called speech recognition, is
the computer’s capability of distinguishing spoken
words. Voice recognition programs recognize a vocab-
ulary of preprogrammed words. The vocabulary of
voice recognition programs can range from two words
to millions of words.
AUDIO INPUT
Voice input is part of a larger category of input
called audio input. Audio input is the process of entering any
sound into the computer such as speech, music, and sound effects.
To enter high-quality sound into a personal computer, the com-
puter must have a sound card. Users enter sound into a computer
via devices such as microphones, tape players, CD/DVD players,
or radios, each of which plugs in a port on the sound card.
Some users also enter music and other sound effects using
external MIDI devices such as an electronic piano keyboard
(Figure 5-12). MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) is the
electronic music industry’s standard that defines how digital
musical devices represent sounds electronically. Software that con-
forms to the MIDI standard allows users to compose and edit
music and many other sounds.

Controlling Games by Thinking
Putting on your thinking cap one day may
take on a whole new meaning for gamers.
Scientists are envisioning a gamer wearing
a baseball-cap device or a headband and
then having a wireless connection with a
computer. 
One product uses tiny, metal sensors 
to detect brainwave activity without skin
contact. Using special software, the wearer
must calibrate his individual brainwaves with the computer by imagining
moving his left or right hand or foot or rotating an object. Electrodes
then pick up these thought signals. Once the person is in sync with the
computer, he can imagine moving his hands or feet to trigger an action
in the game.
Another gaming interface prototype uses three sensor pads embedded
in a headband actuator to receive facial muscle activity, eye movement,
and brain activity cues. Eleven specific signals then are assigned to a
specific keystroke or mouse button.
The thought-controlled devices also could be used as communication
tools for people who cannot speak or sign by translating their brainwave
electrical impulses into letters and words. For more information, visit
scsite.com/dcf5e/ch5/looking and then click Thought-Controlled Input.

Input for Smart Phones, PDAs, and Tablet PCs
Mobile devices, such as smart phones and PDAs, and mobile computers, such as the Tablet PC, offer
convenience for the mobile user. A variety of alternatives for entering data and instructions is available
for these devices and computers. 
SMART PHONES
Users enter data and instructions into a smart phone using a variety of techniques
(Figure 5-13). You can talk directly into the smart phone’s microphone or into a Bluetooth headset that
wirelessly communicates with the smart phone to receive audio. Some smart phones have digital cameras
that take pictures and touch-sensitive pads that enable you to interact with media, such as music and pic-
tures. Others can receive GPS signals to provide maps and directions to users and include card readers. 
Some smart phones have a built-in mini keyboard. For those that do not, users can enter data and
messages into the smart phone using its keypad. Types of messages users send with smart phones
include text messages, instant messages, and picture/video messages.

PDAS
A user enters data and instructions into a PDA in many ways. PDAs 
ship with a basic stylus, which is the primary input device (Figure 5-14). As 
with the smart phone, you can use the stylus to enter data in two ways: using 
an on-screen keyboard or using handwriting recognition software.
For users who prefer typing to handwriting, some PDAs have a built-in mini
keyboard. For PDAs without a keyboard, users can purchase a keyboard that
snaps on the bottom of the device. Other users type on a desktop computer 
or notebook computer keyboard and transfer the data to 
the PDA.
Because today’s smart phones provide PDA functions, it 
is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate between the
two devices. This convergence trend has led manufacturers 
to refer to PDAs and/or smart phones simply as handhelds.
TABLET PCS
The primary input device for a Tablet PC is a 
pressure-sensitive digital pen, which allows users to write on the
device’s screen. Both the slate and convertible designs of a Tablet 
PC provide a means for keyboard input. 
To access peripherals at their home or office, users can
slide their Tablet PC in a docking station. A docking station,
which is an external device that attaches to a mobile com-
puter, contains a power connection and provides connections
to peripherals and usually also includes slots for memory
cards, CD/DVD drives, and other devices (Figure 5-15). The
design of docking stations varies depending on the type of
mobile computer or device to which they attach.
Digital Cameras
A digital camera allows users to take pictures and store the
photographed images digitally, instead of on traditional film
(Figure 5-16). Most digital cameras have some amount of inter-
nal flash memory to store images. Many also can store addi-
tional images on mobile storage media, including a flash
memory card, memory stick, and mini disc. 
Digital cameras typically allow users to review, and some-
times edit, images while they are in the camera. Some digital
cameras can connect to or communicate wirelessly with a com-
puter or printer, allowing users to print or view images directly
from the camera. Most cameras can connect with a cable to a
computer’s USB port, so that you can use the computer to
access the media in the camera just like you access any other
drive on the computer.
Often users prefer to download, or transfer a copy of, the
images from the digital camera to the computer’s hard disk,
where the images are available for editing with photo editing
software, printing, faxing, sending via e-mail, including in
another document, or posting to a Web site or photo 
community for everyone to see.

A digital camera often features flash, zoom, automatic focus, and special effects. Some allow users
to record short audio narrations for photographed images. Others even record short video clips in
addition to still images. 
One factor that affects the quality of a digital camera is its resolution. Resolution is the number
of horizontal and vertical pixels in a display device. A digital camera’s resolution is defined in pix-
els. A pixel (short for picture element) is the smallest element in an electronic image. The greater
the number of pixels the camera uses to capture an image, the better the quality of the image.
Digital camera resolutions range from about 4 million to more than 16 million pixels (MP). For
additional information about digital cameras, read the Digital Imaging and Video Technology
feature that follows this chapter.
Video Input
Video input is the process of capturing full-motion images and storing them on a computer’s
storage medium such as a hard disk or DVD. Some video devices use analog video signals. A
digital video (DV) camera, by contrast, records video as digital signals instead of analog signals.
Many DV cameras have the capability of capturing still frames, as well as motion. To transfer
recorded images to a hard disk or CD or DVD, users connect DV cameras directly to a USB port 
or a FireWire port on the system unit. After saving the video on a storage medium, such as a hard
disk or DVD, you can play it or edit it using video editing
software on a computer.
WEB CAMS
A Web cam, also called a PC video camera, is
a type of digital video camera that enables a home or small
business user to capture video and still images, send e-mail
messages with video attachments, add live images to
instant messages, broadcast live images over the Internet,
and make video telephone calls. During a video telephone
call, both parties see each other as they communicate over
the Internet (Figure 5-17). The cost of Web cams usually is
less than $100.
Some Web cams display their output on a Web page. 
This use of a Web cam attracts Web site visitors by show-
ing images that change regularly. Home or small business
users might use Web cams to show a work in progress,
weather and traffic information, employees at work,
photos of a vacation, and countless other images. 
VIDEO CONFERENCING
A video conference is a 
meeting between two or more geographically sepa-
rated people who use a network or the Internet to
transmit audio and video data (Figure 5-18). To par-
ticipate in a video conference, you need video confer-
encing software along with a microphone, speakers,
and a video camera attached to a computer. As you
speak, members of the meeting hear your voice on
their speakers. Any image in front of the video cam-
era, such as a person’s face, appears in a window on
each participant’s screen. 
As the costs of video conferencing hardware and
software decrease, increasingly more business meet-
ings, corporate training, and educational classes will
be conducted as video conferences.

Scanners and Reading Devices
Some input devices save users time by capturing data directly from a source document, which
is the original form of the data. Examples of source documents include time cards, order forms,
invoices, paychecks, advertisements, brochures, photos, inventory tags, or any other document
that contains data to be processed.
Devices that can capture data directly from a source document include optical scanners, optical
readers, bar code readers, RFID readers, magnetic stripe card readers, and magnetic-ink
character recognition readers. 
OPTICAL SCANNERS
An optical scanner, usually called a scanner, is a light-sensing input
device that reads printed text and graphics and then translates the results into a form the com-
puter can process. A flatbed scanner works in a manner similar to a copy machine except it creates
a file of the document in memory instead of a paper copy (Figure 5-19). Once you scan a picture or
document, you can display the scanned object on the screen, modify its appearance, store it on
a storage medium, print it, fax it, attach it to an e-mail message, include it in another
document, or post it to a Web site or photo community for everyone to see.
Many scanners include OCR (optical character recognition) software, which can
read and convert text documents into electronic files. OCR software converts a
scanned image into a text file that can be edited, for example, with a word
processing program. 
OPTICAL READERS
An optical reader is a device that uses a light source to read characters, marks,
and codes and then converts them into digital data that a computer can process. Two technologies
used by optical readers are optical character recognition and optical mark recognition.
• Optical character recognition (OCR) involves reading typewritten, computer-printed, or 
hand-printed characters from ordinary documents and translating the images into a form 
the computer can process. Most OCR devices include a small optical scanner for reading
characters and sophisticated software to analyze what is read. OCR devices range from large
machines that can read thousands of documents per minute to handheld wands that read one
document at a time. 
Many companies use OCR characters
on turnaround documents. A turnaround
document is a document that you return
(turn around) to the company that creates
and sends it. For example, when con-
sumers receive a bill, they often tear 
off a portion of the bill and send it back 
to the company with their payment
(Figure 5-20). The portion of the bill 
they return usually has their payment
amount, account number, and other
information printed in OCR characters.
• Optical mark recognition (OMR) 
devices read hand-drawn marks such 
as small circles or rectangles. A person
places these marks on a form, such 
as a test, survey, or questionnaire 
answer sheet.

BAR CODE READERS
A bar code 
reader, also called a bar code scanner, 
is an optical reader that uses laser 
beams to read bar codes (Figure 5-21). 
A bar code is an identification code 
that consists either of a set of vertical 
lines and spaces of different widths or 
a two-dimensional pattern of dots, 
squares, and other images. A 2-D bar 
code can store much more data than 
the traditional linear bar code. The 
bar code represents data that identifies 
the manufacturer and the item. 
Manufacturers print a bar code 
either on a product’s package or 
on a label that is affixed to a product. 
Read Ethics & Issues 5-2 for a related 
discussion.
RFID READERS
RFID (radio frequency identification)
is a technology that uses radio signals to communicate
with a tag placed in or attached to an object, an animal,
or a person. RFID tags, which contain a memory chip
and an antenna, are available in many shapes and
sizes. An RFID reader reads information on the tag via
radio waves. RFID readers can be handheld devices or
mounted in a stationary object such as a doorway.
Many retailers see RFID as an alternative to bar
code identification because it does not require direct
contact or line-of-site transmission. Each product in a
store would contain a tag that identifies the product
(Figure 5-22). As consumers remove products from
the store shelves and walk through a checkout area,
an RFID reader reads the tag(s) and communicates
with a computer that calculates the amount due.
Other uses of RFID include tracking times of runners
in a marathon; tracking location of soldiers, employee
wardrobes, airline baggage, and misplaced or stolen
goods; checking lift tickets of skiers; managing inven-
tory; gauging temperature and pressure of tires on a

Is Using the Self-Checkout Saving Anybody Time or Money?
If you have not yet felt the pressure of the gazes from a line of people behind you as you attempt to scan your groceries at a self-checkout
lane, you soon may be in the minority. A growing number of consumers are opting to use self-checkout lanes in grocery stores, home-
improvement stores, warehouse clubs, and superstores. Using a self-checkout lane, buyers scan the bar codes on their purchases and then
process their own payment with little or no intervention from store employees. In multicultural areas, the self-checkout technology serves
as an instant translator by allowing the consumer to select a language with which to interact. With self-checkout expected to grow from
$200 billion to over $1.2 trillion by 2009, some are hesitant to jump on the self-checkout bandwagon. The technology is extremely expen-
sive, requires frequent maintenance, and consumers quite often require help from store employees to perform the checkout. Also, just a
few well-publicized major problems with self-checkout quickly could sway consumers’ opinion of the technology. Some believe that self-
checkout could lead to more shoplifting. Supporters of self-checkout discount this notion, stating that weight verification for each item and
the fact that would-be thieves feel they are being watched more closely by hidden cameras at self-checkout lanes leads to less theft. Would
you or do you use self-checkout? Why or why not? Do you think that stores ultimately will benefit from an investment in self-checkout
technology? Why or why not? Do you think that self-checkout would discourage or encourage shoplifting? Why or why not?

MAGNETIC STRIPE CARD READERS
A magnetic stripe card reader, often
called a magstripe reader, reads the
magnetic stripe on the back of credit
cards, entertainment cards, bank cards,
and other similar cards. The stripe con-
tains information identifying you and
the card issuer (Figure 5-23). Some
information stored in the stripe includes
your name, account number, the card’s
expiration date, and a country code.
When a consumer swipes a credit
card through a magstripe reader, it
reads the information stored on the
magnetic stripe on the card. If the magstripe reader
rejects the card, it is possible that the magnetic
stripe is scratched, dirty, or erased. Exposure to a
magnet or magnetic field can erase the contents of
a card’s magnetic stripe.
MICR READERS
MICR (magnetic-ink character 
recognition) devices read text printed with magne-
tized ink. An MICR reader converts MICR charac-
ters into a form the computer can process. The
banking industry almost exclusively uses MICR for
check processing. Each check in your checkbook
has precoded MICR characters beginning at the
lower-left edge (Figure 5-24).

Clothing, Appliances Show RFID Uses
New business and consumer applications for
RFID tags are likely to continue as manufac-
turing costs continue to decline to as little as
five cents per tag. Clothing, for example,
could have a unique RFID tag embedded in
the label. When you purchase apparel and
then desire to return an item to the store for
a refund, a clerk would scan the RFID tag and then reference a
record of when you purchased the item, the original price, and the
method of payment.
This same clothing tag automatically could tell your washing
machine which settings to use to launder the fabric properly. It also
could keep an inventory of which clothes are in your closet and which
are at the dry cleaners or in the laundry basket.
Your refrigerator could monitor its contents and alert you when
expiration dates are near. It also could create shopping lists and
search the Internet to locate recipes that use items on hand. For more
information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch5/looking and then click RFID.

C6672_CH05 pp4.qxd  1/30/08  2:10 PM  Page 179

When a bank receives a check for payment, it uses an MICR inscriber to print the amount of the
check in MICR characters in the lower-right corner. The check then is sorted or routed to the cus-
tomer’s bank, along with thousands of others. Each check is inserted in an MICR reader, which
sends the check information — including the amount of the check — to a computer for processing. 
Terminals 
A terminal consists of a keyboard, a monitor, a video card, and memory. These components
often are housed in a single unit. Users enter data and instructions into a terminal and then 
transmit some or all of the data over a network to a host computer.
Special-purpose terminals perform specific tasks and contain features uniquely designed for 
use in a particular industry. Two special-purpose terminals are point-of-sale (POS) terminals and
automated teller machines.
• Point-of-Sale (POS) Terminals — The location in a retail or grocery store where a consumer
pays for goods or services is the point of sale (POS). Most retail stores use a POS terminal to
record purchases, process credit or debit cards, and update inventory.
Many POS terminals handle credit card or debit card payments and thus also include a magstripe
reader. Some have fingerprint readers (discussed in the next section) that read your fingerprint,
which is linked to a payment method such as a checking account or credit card. Once the transaction
is approved, the terminal prints a receipt for the customer. A self-service POS terminal allows
consumers to perform all checkout-related activities (Figure 5-25). That is, they scan the items, bag
the items, and pay for the items themselves.  
• Automated Teller Machines — An automated teller machine (ATM) is a self-service banking
machine that connects to a host computer through a network (Figure 5-26). Banks place ATMs in
convenient locations, including grocery stores, convenience stores, retail outlets, shopping malls,
and gas stations.
Using an ATM, people withdraw cash, deposit money, transfer funds, or inquire about an
account balance. Some ATMs have a touch screen; others have special buttons or keypads for
entering input. To access a bank account, you insert a plastic bankcard in the ATM’s magstripe
reader. The ATM asks you to enter a password, called a personal identification number (PIN),
which verifies that you are the holder of the bankcard. When your transaction is complete, the
ATM prints a receipt for your records.

Biometric Input
Biometrics is the technology of authenticating a person’s identity by verifying a personal 
characteristic. Biometric devices grant users access to programs, systems, or rooms by analyzing
some physiological (related to physical or chemical activities in the body) or behavioral character-
istic. Examples include fingerprints, hand geometry, facial features, voice, signatures, and eye
patterns.
The most widely used biometric device today is a fingerprint reader. A
fingerprint reader captures curves and indentations of a fingerprint. To
save on desk space, some newer keyboards and notebook computers
have a fingerprint reader built into them, which allows users to log on to
programs and Web sites via their fingerprint instead of entering a user
name and password (Figure 5-27). Grocery and retail stores now use finger-
print readers as a means of payment, where the customer’s fingerprint is linked 
to a payment method such as a checking account or credit card.
A face recognition system captures a live face image and compares it with a
stored image to determine if the person is a legitimate user. Some buildings use
face recognition systems to secure access to rooms. Law enforcement, surveillance
systems, and airports use face recognition to protect the public.
Biometric devices measure the shape and size of a person’s hand using a hand geometry
system. Because their cost is more than $1,000, larger companies typically use these systems as
time and attendance devices or as security devices. 
A voice verification system compares a person’s live speech with their stored voice pattern.
Larger organizations sometimes use voice verification systems as time and attendance devices.
Many companies also use this technology for access to sensitive files and networks. 
A signature verification system recognizes the shape of your handwritten
signature, as well as measures the pressure exerted and the motion used to
write the signature. Signature verification systems use a specialized pen
and tablet. 
High security areas use iris recognition systems. The camera in an iris
recognition system uses iris recognition technology to read patterns in the
iris of the eye (Figure 5-28). These patterns are as unique as a fingerprint.
Iris recognition systems are quite expensive and are used by government
security organizations, the military, and financial institutions that deal with
highly sensitive data. Some organizations use retinal scanners, which work
similarly but instead scan patterns of blood vessels in the back of the retina.
Sometimes, fingerprint, iris, retina, and other biometric data are stored 
on a smart card. A smart card, which is comparable in size to a credit card
or ATM card, stores the personal data on a thin microprocessor that is
embedded in the card.

WHAT IS OUTPUT?
Output is data that has been processed into a useful form. That is, computers process data
(input) into information (output). Users view or watch output on a screen, print it, or hear it
through speakers, headphones, or earphones. While working with a computer, a user encounters
four basic categories of output: text, graphics, audio, and video (Figure 5-29). Very often, a single
form of output, such as a Web page, includes more than one of these categories.
An output device is any hardware component that conveys information to one or more people.
Commonly used output devices include display devices; printers; speakers, headphones, and ear-
phones; fax machines and fax modems; multifunction peripherals; data projectors; and interactive
whiteboards.

DISPLAY DEVICES
A display device is an output device that visually conveys text, graphics, and video information.
Desktop computers typically use a monitor as their display device. A monitor is a display device
that is packaged as a separate peripheral. Some monitors have a tilt-and-swivel base that allows
users to adjust the angle of the screen to minimize neck strain and reduce glare from overhead
lighting. With some, you can rotate the screen. Monitor controls permit users to adjust the
brightness, contrast, positioning, height, and width of images. 
Most mobile computers and devices integrate the display and other components into the same
physical case.

Display devices usually show text, graphics, and video information in color. Some, however, are
monochrome. Monochrome means the information appears in one color (such as white, amber,
green, black, blue, or gray) on a different color background (such as black or grayish-white). Some
mobile devices use monochrome displays because they require less battery power.
Types of display devices include LCD monitors and LCD screens, plasma monitors, and CRT
monitors. The following pages discuss each of these display devices.
LCD Monitors and LCD Screens
An LCD monitor, also called a flat panel monitor, is a desktop monitor that uses a liquid 
crystal display to produce images (Figure 5-30). These monitors produce sharp, flicker-free
images. LCD monitors have a small footprint; that is, they do not take up much desk space. 
LCD monitors are available in a variety of sizes, with the
more common being 17, 19, 20, 22, and 27 inches — some
are 45 or 65 inches. Many are widescreen, which are
much wider than they are tall. You measure a monitor
the same way you measure a television, that is,
diagonally from one corner to the other. 
Mobile computers, such as notebook computers and
Tablet PCs, and mobile devices, such as Ultra-Mobile
PCs, portable media players, and smart phones often
have built-in LCD screens (Figure 5-31). Notebook 
computer screens are available in a variety of sizes,
with the more common being 14.1, 15.4, 17, and 20.1
inches. Tablet PC screens range from 8.4 inches to 14.1
inches. Typical screen sizes of Ultra-Mobile PCs are 5
inches to 7 inches. Portable media players usually have
screen sizes from 1.5 inches to 3.5 inches. On smart
phones, screen sizes range from 2.5 inches to 3.5 inches.

LCD TECHNOLOGY AND QUALITY
A liquid crystal display (LCD) uses a liquid compound to 
present information on a display device. Computer LCDs typically contain fluorescent tubes that
emit light waves toward the liquid-crystal cells, which are sandwiched between two sheets of
material.
The quality of an LCD monitor or LCD screen depends primarily on its resolution, response
time, brightness, dot pitch, and contrast ratio.
• Resolution is the number of horizontal and vertical pixels in a display device. For example, a
monitor that has a 1440 3 900 resolution displays up to 1440 pixels per horizontal row and 
900 pixels per vertical row, for a total of 1,296,000 pixels to create a screen image. A higher
resolution uses a greater number of pixels and thus provides a smoother, sharper, and clearer
image. As the resolution increases, however, some items on the screen appear smaller.
With LCD monitors and screens, resolution generally is proportional to the size of the device.
That is, the resolution increases for larger monitors and screens. For example, a widescreen 
19-inch LCD monitor typically has a resolution of 1440 3 900, while a widescreen 22-inch LCD
monitor has a resolution of 1680 3 1050. LCDs are geared for a specific resolution.
• Response time of an LCD monitor or screen is the time in milliseconds (ms) that it takes to turn
a pixel on or off. LCD monitors’ and screens’ response times range from 3 to 16 ms. The lower
the number, the faster the response time.
• Brightness of an LCD monitor or LCD screen is measured in nits. A nit is a unit of visible light
intensity. The higher the nits, the brighter the images.
• Dot pitch, sometimes called pixel pitch, is the distance in millimeters between pixels on a
display device. Average dot pitch on LCD monitors and screens should be .30 mm or lower.
The lower the number, the sharper the image.
• Contrast ratio describes the difference in light intensity between the brightest white and
darkest black that can be displayed on an LCD monitor. Contrast ratios today range from
500:1 to 2000:1. Higher contrast ratios represent colors better.
PORTS AND LCD MONITORS
A cable on a monitor plugs in a port on the system unit. LCD
monitors use a digital signal to produce a picture. To display the highest quality images, an LCD
monitor should plug in a DVI or an HDMI port. A DVI (Digital Video Interface) port enables
digital signals to transmit directly
to an LCD monitor. An HDMI
(High-Definition Media Interface)
port combines DVI with high-
definition (HD) television 
and video.
Plasma Monitors
A plasma monitor is a display
device that uses gas plasma tech-
nology, which sandwiches a layer
of gas between two glass plates
(Figure 5-32). 
Plasma monitors offer screen
sizes up to 60 inches wide and
richer colors than LCD monitors
but are more expensive. Like LCD
monitors, plasma monitors can
hang directly on a wall.

FAQ 5-2
CRT Monitors
A CRT monitor is a desktop monitor that contains a cathode-ray tube (Figure 5-33). A cathode-ray
tube (CRT) is a large, sealed glass tube. The front of the tube is the screen.
CRT monitors for desktop computers are available in various sizes, with the more common
being 15, 17, 19, 21, and 22 inches. In addition to monitor size, advertisements also list a CRT
monitor’s viewable size. The viewable size is the diagonal measurement of the actual viewing
area provided by the screen in the CRT monitor. A 21-inch monitor, for example, may have a
viewable size of 20 inches.
A CRT monitor usually costs less than an LCD monitor but also generates more heat and uses
more power than an LCD monitor. To help reduce the amount of electricity used by monitors and
other computer components, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the ENERGY STAR program. This program
encourages manufacturers to create energy-efficient devices that require little power when the
devices are not in use. Monitors and devices that meet ENERGY STAR guidelines display an
ENERGY STAR label.

(EMR) is a magnetic field that travels at the speed of light. Excessive amounts of EMR can pose a
health risk. To be safe, all high-quality CRT monitors comply with a set of standards that defines
acceptable levels of EMR for a monitor. To protect yourself even further, sit at arm’s length from
the CRT monitor because EMR travels only a short distance.

A printer is an output device that produces text and graphics on a physical medium such as
paper or transparency film. Many different printers exist with varying speeds, capabilities, and
printing methods. Figure 5-34 presents a list of questions to help you decide on the printer best
suited to your needs. 
The following pages discuss producing printed output and the various printer types including
ink-jet printers, photo printers, laser printers, thermal printers, mobile printers, plotters, and large
format printers.

Producing Printed Output
Although many users today print by connecting a computer to a printer with a cable, a variety
of printing options are available as shown in Figure 5-35.
Today, wireless printing technology makes the task of printing from a notebook computer,
Tablet PC, smart phone, or digital camera much easier. Two wireless technologies for printing are
Bluetooth and infrared. With Bluetooth printing, a computer or other device transmits output to a
printer via radio waves. With infrared printing, a printer communicates with a computer or other
device using infrared light waves.
Instead of downloading images from a digital camera to a computer, users can print images
using a variety of other techniques. Some cameras connect directly to a printer via a cable. Others
store images on media cards that can be removed and inserted in the printer. Some printers have
a docking station, into which the user inserts the camera to print pictures stored in the camera.
Finally, many home and business users print to a central printer on a network. Their computer
may communicate with the network printer via cables or wirelessly.

Nonimpact Printers
A nonimpact printer forms characters and graphics on a piece of paper without actually striking
the paper. Some nonimpact printers spray ink, while others use heat or pressure to create images.
Commonly used nonimpact printers are ink-jet printers, photo printers, laser printers, thermal
printers, mobile printers, plotters, and large-format printers. 
Ink-Jet Printers
An ink-jet printer is a type of nonimpact printer that forms characters and graphics by spraying
tiny drops of liquid ink onto a piece of paper. Ink-jet printers have become a popular type of color
printer for use in the home. Ink-jet printers produce text and graphics in both black-and-white
and color on a variety of paper types (Figure 5-36). A reasonable quality ink-jet printer costs less
than $100.
As with many other input and output devices, one factor that determines the quality of an 
ink-jet printer is its resolution. Printer resolution is measured by the number of dots per inch
(dpi) a printer can print. Most ink-jet printers can print from 1200 to 4800 dpi. 
The speed of an ink-jet printer is measured by the number of pages per minute (ppm) it can
print. Most ink-jet printers print from 12 to 36 ppm. Graphics and colors print at a slower rate.

FIGURE 5-36
Ink-jet printers are a popular type of color printer used in the home.
C6672_CH05 pp4.qxd  1/30/08  2:10 PM  Page 189

The print head mechanism in an ink-jet printer contains ink-filled print cartridges. Each 
cartridge has fifty to several hundred small ink holes, or nozzles. The ink propels through any
combination of the nozzles to form a character or image on the paper. When the print cartridge
runs out of ink, you simply replace the cartridge. Most ink-jet printers have two or more print car-
tridges: one containing black ink and the other(s) containing colors. Consider the number of ink
cartridges a printer requires, along with the cost of the cartridges, when purchasing a printer.
Photo Printers
A photo printer is a color printer
that produces photo-lab-quality pic-
tures (Figure 5-37). Some photo
printers print just one or two sizes
of images, for example, 3 3 5 inches
and 4 3 6 inches. Others print up to
letter size, legal size, or even larger.
Many photo printers use ink-jet
technology. With models that can
print letter-sized documents, users
connect the photo printer to their
computer and use it for all their
printing needs. Read Looking Ahead
5-3 for a look at the next generation
of paper.
Most photo printers are PictBridge
enabled, so that you can print pic-
tures without a computer. PictBridge
is a standard technology that allows
you to print pictures directly from a
digital camera by connecting a cable
from the digital camera to a USB
port on the printer.
Photo printers also usually have a built-in card slot(s) so that
the printer can print digital photos directly from a media card.
That is, you do not need to transfer the images from the media
card to the computer to print them. Some photo printers have
built-in LCD color screens, allowing users to view and
enhance the pictures before printing them. 
Laser Printers
A laser printer is a high-speed, high-quality nonimpact
printer (Figure 5-38). Laser printers for personal computers
ordinarily use individual sheets of paper stored in one or
more removable trays that slide in the printer case.
Laser printers print text and graphics in high-quality reso-
lutions, usually ranging from 1200 to 2400 dpi. While laser
printers usually cost more than ink-jet printers, many mod-
els are available at affordable prices for the home user. Laser
printers usually print at faster speeds than ink-jet printers. 
A laser printer for the home and small office user typically
prints black-and-white text at speeds of 12 to 37 ppm. Color
laser printers print 8 to 35 ppm. Laser printers for large 
business users print more than 150 ppm.

Talking Paper Provides Information,
Warnings
Product information and warnings
typically are printed on an item’s
label and packaging, but that
method of communication is
about to change with the advent
of talking paper. Researchers 
at Mid Sweden University are
studying methods of using printed ink and speakers that
communicate signals when pressed by a human finger.
The electronically conductive ink is linked to wires at the
edge of the paper that relay signals to a chip embedded with
audio files. Prototype files have given nutrition information,
instructions about taking medications, and warnings about
inherently dangerous products. The audio files are streamed
through printed speakers that also are connected to the wires.
The research is part of the University’s Paper Four project,
which is funded by the European Union and Sweden’s paper
industry. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch5/

black-and-white
laser printer
Depending on the quality, speed, and type of laser printer, the cost ranges from a few hundred
to a few thousand dollars for the home and small office user, and several hundred thousand dol-
lars for the large business user. Color laser printers are slightly higher priced than otherwise
equivalent black-and-white laser printers.
Operating in a manner similar to a copy machine, a laser printer creates images using a laser
beam and powdered ink, called toner. Black-and-white laser printers use one toner cartridge.
Color laser printers use multiple cartridges — one for black and one or more for colors. When 
the toner runs out, you replace the toner cartridge. 
191
PRINTERS
Thermal Printers
A thermal printer generates images by pushing electrically heated pins
against heat-sensitive paper. Basic thermal printers are inexpensive, but 
the print quality is low and the images tend to fade over time. Self-service
gas pumps often print gas receipts using a built-in lower-quality thermal
printer. Many point-of-sale terminals in retail and grocery stores also print
purchase receipts on thermal paper.
Some thermal printers have high print quality. A dye-sublimation printer,
sometimes called a digital photo printer, uses heat to transfer colored dye 
to specially coated paper. Professional applications requiring high image
quality, such as photography studios, medical labs, and security identifica-
tion systems, use dye-sublimation printers. These high-end printers cost
thousands of dollars and print images in a wide range of sizes. 
Dye-sublimation printers for the home or small business user, by 
contrast, typically print images in only one or two sizes and are much
slower than their professional counterparts. These lower-end dye-
sublimation printers are comparable in cost to a photo printer based 
on ink-jet technology (Figure 5-39).
FIGURE 5-38
Laser printers are available in both black-and-white and color models.

How do I dispose of toner cartridges?
Do not throw them in the garbage. The housing contains iron, metal, and aluminum that is not biodegradable. The ink toner inside the 
cartridges contains toxic chemicals that pollute water and soil if discarded in dumps. Instead, recycle empty toner cartridges. Recycling
programs in which some schools and organizations participate offer discounts or cash to customers who bring in depleted cartridges. If
you are unable to find a recycling program in your area, contact your printer manufacturer to see if it has a recycling program. For more
information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch5/faq and then click Recycling Toner Cartridges.

Mobile Printers
A mobile printer is a small, lightweight, battery-powered printer
that allows a mobile user to print from a notebook computer,
Tablet PC, or smart phone or other personal mobile device
while traveling (Figure 5-40). Barely wider than the paper
on which they print, mobile printers fit easily in a brief-
case alongside a notebook computer. Mobile printers
mainly use ink-jet or thermal technology. 
Plotters and Large-Format Printers
Plotters are sophisticated printers used to produce
high-quality drawings such as blueprints, maps, and
circuit diagrams. These printers are used in special-
ized fields such as engineering and drafting and
usually are very costly. 
Using ink-jet printer technology, but on a much
larger scale, a large-format printer creates photo-
realistic-quality color prints. Graphic artists use these 
high-cost, high-performance printers for signs, posters, and 
other professional quality displays (Figure 5-41).

Impact Printers
An impact printer forms characters and graphics on a piece of paper by striking a mechanism
against an inked ribbon that physically contacts the paper. Impact printers are ideal for printing
multipart forms because they easily print through many layers of paper. Two commonly used
types of impact printers are dot-matrix printers and line printers. 
A dot-matrix printer is an impact printer that produces printed images when tiny wire pins on
a print head mechanism strike an inked ribbon (Figure 5-42). When the ribbon presses against the
paper, it creates dots that form characters and graphics.
FIGURE 5-40
A mobile printer.
C6672_CH05 pp4.qxd  1/30/08  2:11 PM  Page 192

Dot-matrix printers typically use
continuous-form paper, in which thou-
sands of sheets of paper are connected
together end to end. The pages have
holes along the sides to help feed the
paper through the printer. The speed
of most dot-matrix printers ranges
from 375 to 1100 characters per second
(cps), depending on the desired print
quality.
A line printer is a high-speed impact
printer that prints an entire line at a
time. The speed of a line printer is
measured by the number of lines per
minute (lpm) it can print. Some line
printers print as many as 3,000 lpm. 
OTHER OUTPUT DEVICES
In addition to monitors and printers, other output devices are available for specific uses and 
applications. These include speakers, headphones, and earphones; fax machines and fax modems;
multifunction peripherals; data projectors; and interactive whiteboards.
Speakers, Headphones, and Earphones
An audio output device is a component of a computer that produces music, speech, or other sounds,
such as beeps. Three commonly used audio output devices are speakers, headphones, and earphones.
Most personal computers have a small internal speaker that usually emits only low-quality sound.
Thus, many personal computer users attach surround sound speakers or speaker systems to their
computers to generate higher-quality sounds (Figure 5-43). Most surround sound computer speaker
systems include one or two center
speakers and two or more satellite
speakers that are positioned so that
sound emits from all directions.
Speakers typically have tone and vol-
ume controls, allowing users to adjust
settings. To boost the low bass sounds,
surround sound speaker systems also
include a subwoofer. In many cases, a
cable connects the speakers or the sub-
woofer to a port on the sound card.
With wireless speakers, however, a
transmitter connects to the sound card,
which wirelessly communicates with the
speakers.
Many users opt for a wireless music
system, where you can play any CD,
DVD, or media file on your computer
and transmit the audio to a home or
office stereo or television. You also can
plug a portable media player, such as an
iPod, into the computer to hear its songs
on the stereo or television speakers.

C6672_CH05 pp4.qxd  1/30/08  2:11 PM  Page 193

In a computer laboratory or other crowded environment, speakers might not be practical.
Instead, users can plug headphones or earphones in a port on the sound card, in a speaker, or in
the front of the system unit. With headphones or earphones, only the individual wearing the
headphones or earphones hears the sound from the computer. The difference is that headphones
cover or are placed outside of the ear, whereas earphones, or earbuds, rest inside the ear canal.
Portable media players usually include a set of earphones. As an alternative, you can listen to
audio from the portable media player through speakers in a vehicle or on a stereo system at home
or work. Or, you can purchase speakers specifically designed to play audio from a portable media
player.
Electronically produced voice output is growing in popularity. Voice output occurs when you
hear a person’s voice or when the computer talks to you through the speakers on the computer.
In some programs, the computer can speak the contents of a document through voice output. On
the Web, you can listen to (or download and then listen to) interviews, talk shows, sporting
events, news, recorded music, and live concerts from many radio and television stations. Some
Web sites and programs, such as media players, dedicate themselves to providing voice output,
such as those that allow you to listen to
and then purchase and download songs.
VoIP allows users to speak and listen to
others over the Internet using their 
computer or mobile device.
Fax Machines and Fax Modems
A fax machine is a device that codes and
encodes documents so that they can be
transmitted over telephone lines (Figure 
5-44). The documents can contain text,
drawings, or photos, or can be handwritten.
The term fax refers to a document that you
send or receive via a fax machine.
Many computers include fax capability
by using a fax modem. A fax modem
transmits computer-prepared documents,
such as a word processing letter, or docu-
ments that have been digitized with a
scanner or digital camera. A fax modem
transmits these faxes to a fax machine or
to another fax modem.
Multifunction Peripherals
A multifunction peripheral is a single
device that looks like a copy machine but
provides the functionality of a printer,
scanner, copy machine, and perhaps a fax
machine (Figure 5-45). Some use color
ink-jet printer technology, while others
include a black-and-white or color laser
printer. An advantage of these devices is
they are significantly less expensive than
if you purchase each device separately. If
the device breaks down, however, you
lose all four functions, which is the 
primary disadvantage.

Data Projectors
A data projector is a device that takes the text and images displaying on a computer screen and
projects them on a larger screen so that an audience can see the image clearly. Some data projec-
tors are large devices that attach to a ceiling or wall in an auditorium. Others, designed for the
mobile user, are small portable devices that can be transported easily (Figure 5-46).

Interactive Whiteboards
An interactive whiteboard is a touch-
sensitive device, resembling a dry-erase
board, that displays the image on a con-
nected computer screen. A presenter controls
the computer program by clicking a remote
control, touching the whiteboard, drawing
on or erasing the whiteboard with a special
digital pen and eraser, or writing on a special
tablet. Notes written on the interactive
whiteboard can be saved directly on the
computer. Interactive whiteboards are used
frequently in classrooms as a teaching tool
(Figure 5-47), during meetings as a collab-
oration tool, and to enhance delivery of 
presentations.
Interactive whiteboards, which are hung
on the wall or mounted on a stand, range in
size from 48 to 94 inches. A widely used
interactive whiteboard is the SMART Board.

INPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICES FOR PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED USERS
The ever-increasing presence of computers in everyone’s lives has generated an awareness of the
need to address computing requirements for those who have or may develop physical limitations.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires any company with 15 or more employees 
to make reasonable attempts to accommodate the needs of physically challenged workers. Read 
Ethics and Issues 5-3 for a related discussion. 
Besides voice recognition, which is ideal for blind or visually impaired users, several other input
devices are available. Users with limited hand mobility who want to use a keyboard have several
options. Keyboards with larger keys are available. Still another option is the on-screen keyboard, in
which a graphic of a standard keyboard is displayed on the user’s
screen. As the user clicks letters on the on-screen keyboard, they
appear in the document at the location of the insertion point. An
option for people with limited hand movement is a head-mounted
pointer to control the pointer or insertion point (Figure 5-49). To sim-
ulate the functions of a mouse button, a user works with switches
that control the pointer. The switch might be a hand pad, a foot
pedal, a receptor that detects facial motions, or a pneumatic 
instrument controlled by puffs of air.
For users with mobility, hearing, or vision disabilities, many 
different types of output devices are available. Hearing-impaired 
users, for example, can instruct programs to display words instead 
of sounds. 
Visually impaired users can change Windows Vista settings, such as
increasing the size or changing the color of the text to make the words
easier to read. Instead of using a monitor, blind users can work with
voice output. That is, the computer reads the information that appears 
on the screen. Another alternative is a Braille printer, which outputs
information on paper in Braille (Figure 5-50).

Should Web Sites Be Held Accountable for 
Accessibility Levels for Physically Challenged People?
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has published accessibility 
guidelines for Web sites. The guidelines specify measures that Web site
designers can take to increase accessibility for physically challenged users.
Among its guidelines, the W3C urges Web site designers to provide equiva-
lent text for audio or visual content, include features that allow elements to
be activated and understood using a variety of input and output devices, and
make the user interface follow principles of accessible design. A recent
report found that most Web sites do not meet all of the W3C guidelines.
This failure is disappointing, because many physically challenged users
could benefit from the Web’s capability to bring products and services into
the home. Ironically, a survey discovered that more than 50 percent of the
Web sites run by disability organizations also fail to meet the W3C guide-
lines. Critics contend that these Web sites neglect the needs of their users
and fail to lead by example. The Web site supporters contend, however, that
many sponsoring organizations lack the funding necessary to comply with
the guidelines. Should the government require that all Web sites meet the
W3C accessibility guidelines? Why or why not? Do Web sites run by disabil-
ity organizations have a moral obligation to meet the guidelines? Why?
What can be done to encourage people and organizations to make their Web
sites more accessible?

Graphic Designer/Illustrator
Graphic designers and graphic illustrators are artists, but many do not create original works. Instead, 
they portray visually the ideas of their clients. Illustrators create pictures for books and other publica-
tions and sometimes for commercial products, such as greeting cards. They work in fields such as
fashion, technology, medicine, animation, or even cartoons. Illustrators often prepare their images on a
computer. Designers combine practical skills with artistic talent to convert abstract concepts into designs
for products and advertisements. Many use computer-aided design (CAD) tools to create, visualize, and
modify designs. Designer careers usually are specialized in particular areas, such as:
•
Graphic designers — book covers, stationery, and CD covers
•
Commercial and industrial designers — products and equipment
•
Costume and theater designers — costumes and settings for theater and television
•

Logitech
Personal Interface Products Leader
The average Internet user has more than 40 inches of cords on his desktop, according to 
a Logitech survey. This company is working to reduce desktop clutter with a variety of
cordless peripherals.
A market leader, Logitech has sold more than 50 million wireless devices. It also
designs, manufactures, and markets corded devices. The company’s retail sales account
for more than 85 percent of its revenue.
Two engineering students from Stanford University, Italian-born Pierluigi Zappacosta 
and Swiss-born Daniel Borel, launched Logitech in 1981. Today, the corporation is the
world’s largest manufacturer of the mouse. In 2008, it expanded its notebook product 
portfolio with its VX Nano mouse devices, Alto product line of keyboards and stands, 
Web cams, speakers, headphones, earphones, and USB hubs. For more information, 
visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch5/companies and then click Logitech.
Hewlett-Packard
Technology for Business and Life
If you have printed a document recently, chances are the printer manufacturer was 
Hewlett-Packard (HP). Market analysts estimate that 60 percent of printers sold today 
bear the HP logo, and HP says it ships one million printers each week.
HP is noted for a range of high-quality printers, disk storage systems, UNIX and Windows
servers, and notebook, desktop, and handheld computers. The company is the only technol-
ogy vendor listed in Fortune magazine’s 10 Green Giants, which lists the companies that have

Douglas Engelbart
Creator of the Mouse
The phrase “point and click” might not be part of every computer user’s vocabulary if Douglas Engelbart had not pursued his
engineering dreams. In 1964, he developed the first prototype computer mouse with the goal of making it easier to move a
cursor around a computer screen.
Ten years later, engineers at Xerox refined Engelbart’s prototype and showed the redesigned product to Apple’s Steve Jobs,
who applied the concept to his graphical Macintosh computer. The mouse was mass produced in the mid-1980s, and today it
is the most widely used pointing device.
Engelbart currently is refining his Collective IQ philosophy at his Bootstrap Institute; this concept optimizes collaboration,
creativity, and competition to solve problems. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch5/people and then click Douglas
Engelbart.
Donna Dubinsky
Palm, Handspring, and Numenta Cofounder
The human brain stores and analyzes data to make predictions and reach conclusions. Donna Dubinsky believes her newest
company, Numenta, can create a computer memory system that allows researchers to develop applications that mimic the
human brain’s workings.
Dubinsky is passionate about creating companies that produce ground-breaking technologies. In the mid-1990s, she
sensed that people wanted to own an electronic version of their paper appointment books. She and Jeff Hawkins introduced
the original Palm Pilot at Palm Computing in 1996. Sales of more than two million units made the Palm Pilot the most rapidly
adopted new computing product ever manufactured.
Dubinsky and Hawkins left Palm in 1998 to cofound Handspring, where they introduced several successful products, including
the Treo smart phone. In 2003, Handspring merged with the Palm hardware group to create palmOne, now called Palm.
In 2007, Palm shareholders elected Dubinsky as a Class II director to serve until 2010. For more information, visit

Chapter Review
The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students regarding
any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch5/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
What Are the Characteristics of a Keyboard?
Any hardware component that allows users to enter data and instructions into a computer is an input device. A keyboard is
an input device that contains keys users press to enter data and instructions into a computer. Computer keyboards have a
typing area that includes letters of the alphabet, numbers, punctuation marks, and other basic keys. An enhanced keyboard
also has function keys programmed to issue commands, a numeric keypad, arrow keys, and additional keys and buttons.
How Do Pointing Devices and Gaming and Media Player Controllers Work?
A pointing device allows users to control a small symbol, called a pointer, on the screen. A mouse is a pointing device
that fits under the palm of your hand. As you move the mouse, the pointer on the screen also moves. A trackball is a
stationary pointing device with a ball that you rotate to move the pointer. A touchpad is a flat, pressure-sensitive device
that you slide your fingertip across to move the pointer. A pointing stick is a pointing device positioned on the keyboard
that you push to move the pointer. A light pen is a light-sensitive device that you press against or point at the screen to
select objects. A touch screen is a touch-sensitive display device that you interact with by touching areas of the screen. A
stylus and digital pen use pressure to write text and draw lines. Video and computer games use a game controller as the
input device. Game controllers include a gamepad, which controls the movement and actions of players or objects in
video games or computer games; a joystick, which is a handheld vertical lever mounted on a base; a wheel, which is a
steering-wheel-type input device; a light gun, which is used to shoot targets; and a dance pad, which users press with
their feet in response to instructions. The Wii Remote is a type of motion-sensing game controller that communicates via
Bluetooth wireless technology. A Click Wheel is a type of touch-sensitive pad on a portable media player.
What Are Other Types of Input?
Voice input is the process of entering input by speaking into a microphone. Users can enter data and instructions into a
smart phone with a microphone or headset, with a digital camera or touch-sensitive pad, or with the smart phone’s key-
pad. Mobile users employ a basic stylus to enter data and instructions into a PDA, or sometimes use a built-in keyboard
or snap-on keyboard. The primary input device for a Tablet PC is a digital pen. A digital camera allows users to take 
pictures, store the images digitally, and download the images to a computer’s hard disk. Video input is the process of
capturing full-motion pictures and storing them on a computer’s storage medium. A Web cam, also called a PC video
camera, is used for video input. A scanner is a light-sensing input device that reads printed text and graphics and trans-
lates the results into a form a computer can process. An optical reader is a
device that uses a light source to read characters, marks, and codes and
converts them into digital data. OCR (optical character recognition)
devices use a small optical scanner and software to analyze characters
from ordinary documents. OMR (optical mark recognition) devices read
hand-drawn marks on a form. A bar code reader uses laser beams to read
bar codes. An RFID device reads information on an embedded tag via
radio waves. A magnetic stripe card reader reads the magnetic stripe on
the back of credit cards and other similar cards. MICR (magnetic-ink
character recognition) devices read text printed with magnetized ink. A
terminal consists of a keyboard, a monitor, a video card, and memory and
often is used to perform specific tasks for a particular industry. Biometrics
is the technology of authenticating a person’s identity by verifying a
physical characteristic. Biometric input can include fingerprints, hand
geometry, facial features, voice, signatures, and eye patterns.

What Are the Characteristics of LCD Monitors, LCD Screens, and CRT Monitors?
Any hardware component that conveys information to one or more people is an output device. A display device is a 
commonly used output device that visually conveys text, graphics, and video information. An LCD monitor, also called a
flat panel monitor, is a desktop monitor that uses a liquid crystal display. A liquid crystal display (LCD) uses a liquid 
compound to present information on a display device. A CRT monitor is a desktop monitor that contains a cathode-ray tube.
What Are Various Types of Printers?
A printer is an output device that produces text and graphics on a physical
medium. A nonimpact printer forms characters and graphics without
striking the paper. Several types of nonimpact printers are available. An
ink-jet printer forms characters and graphics by spraying tiny drops of
ink onto paper. A photo printer produces photo-lab-quality pictures. 
A laser printer is a high-speed, high-quality printer that operates in a
manner similar to a copy machine. A thermal printer generates images 
by pushing electrically heated pins against heat-sensitive paper. A mobile
printer is a small, battery-powered printer used to print from a notebook
computer, Tablet PC, smart phone, or other personal mobile devices.
Plotters are used to produce high-quality drawings in specialized fields. 
A large-format printer creates large, photo-realistic-quality color prints.
An impact printer forms characters and graphics by striking a mechanism
against an inked ribbon that physically contacts the paper. A dot-matrix
printer is an impact printer that produces an image when tiny wire pins
on a print head strike an inked ribbon. A line printer is a high-speed
impact printer that prints an entire line at a time. 
What Are the Characteristics of Speakers, Headphones, and Earphones; Fax Machines and Fax Modems;
Multifunction Peripherals; Data Projectors; and Interactive Whiteboards?
Speakers are a type of audio output device added to computers to generate higher-quality sound. With headphones and 
earphones, only the individual wearing the headphones or earphones hears the sound from the computer. The difference
is that headphones cover or are placed outside of the ear, whereas earphones, or earbuds, rest inside the ear canal. A
fax machine is a device that codes and encodes documents so they can be transmitted over telephone lines. Many com-
puters have a fax modem that transmits computer-prepared documents. A multifunction peripheral is a single device
that provides the functionality of a printer, scanner, copy machine, and perhaps a fax machine. A data projector is a
device that takes the text and images displaying on a computer screen and projects them on a larger screen for an audi-
ence. An interactive whiteboard is a touch-sensitive device, resembling a dry-erase board, that displays the image on a
connected computer screen.
What Are Input and Output Options for Physically Challenged Users?
Voice recognition, which is the computer's capability of distinguishing spoken words, is an ideal input option for visually
impaired users. Input options for people with limited hand mobility include keyboards with larger keys, on-screen key-
boards, and head-mounted pointers. Hearing-impaired users can instruct programs to display words instead of sound.
Visually impaired users can change Windows Vista settings such as the size and color of text to make words easier to
read. Instead of a monitor, blind users can use voice output and a Braille printer.

Learn How To
LEARN HOW TO 2: Control Printing on Your Computer
When you print using a computer, you control printing at two different points: first, before the printing actually begins, and 
second, after the document has been sent to the printer and either is physically printing or is waiting to be printed. To set the
parameters for printing and then print the document, complete the 
following steps:
1. Click File on the menu bar of the program that will be used for
printing and then click Print on the File menu to display the Print
dialog box (Figure 5-54). The Print dialog box will vary somewhat
depending on the program used. 
2. In the Print dialog box, make the selections for what printer will be
used, what pages will be printed, the number of copies to be
printed, and any other choices available. For further options, click
the Preferences button (or, sometimes, the Properties button), or
click the Options button.
3. Click the OK button or the Print button. The document being
printed is sent to a print queue, which is an area on disk
storage from which documents actually are printed. This
process occurs so that you can continue to use the program 
even while printing is taking place on the printer.
When you click the Print button to send the document to the print

verywhere you look, people are capturing moments they want to
remember. They take pictures or make movies of their vacations,
birthday parties, activities, accomplishments, sporting events, weddings,
and more. Because of the popularity of digital cameras and digital video
cameras, increasingly more people desire to capture their memories digi-
tally, instead of on film. With digital technology, photographers have the
ability to modify and share the digital images and videos they create.
When you use special hardware and/or software, you can copy, manipu-
late, print, and distribute digital images and videos using your personal
computer and the Internet. Amateurs can achieve professional quality
results by using more sophisticated hardware and software.

Digital photography and recordings deliver significant
benefits over film-based photography and movie making.
With digital cameras, no developing is needed. Instead,
the images reside on storage media such as a hard disk,
CD, DVD, or flash memory card. Unlike film, storage
media can be reused, which reduces costs, saves time, and
provides immediate results. Digital technology allows
greater control over the creative process, both while taking
pictures and video and in the editing process. You can
check results immediately after capturing a picture or
video to determine whether it meets your expectations. If
you are dissatisfied with a picture or video, you can erase
it and recapture it, again and again. Today, many personal
mobile devices, such as smart phones and PDAs, allow
you to capture pictures and video.
As shown in Figure 1, digital cameras, personal
mobile devices, and digital video cameras function as
input devices when they transmit pictures or video to a
personal computer. You can transmit pictures and video by
connecting the video camera or mobile device to your per-
sonal computer using a FireWire or USB 2.0 port, or by
placing the storage media used on the camera or personal
mobile device in the computer. Some cameras and devices
also can transmit wirelessly to a computer. 
When you transmit images that were captured with a
digital camera or personal mobile device to a computer,
you can edit the pictures on the computer, save them on
the computer’s storage media, and print them on a photo
printer via a USB or FireWire port or wirelessly.
When you transmit images or video that were cap-
tured with a digital video camera to a computer, you can
edit the video using video editing software. If desired, 
you can preview the video during the editing process on 
a television. Finally, you save the finished result to the
desired media, such as a DVD or, perhaps, e-mail the
edited video or post it to a video sharing Web site. In this
example, a DVD drive also can be used to input video
from a DVD.

SPECIAL FEATURE
DIGITAL IMAGING
TECHNOLOGY
Digital imaging technology involves capturing and
manipulating still photographic images in an electronic 
format. The following sections outline the steps involved 
in the process of using digital imaging technology.
Select a Digital Camera
A digital camera is a type of camera that stores 
photographed images electronically instead of on tradi-
tional film. Digital cameras are divided into three cate-
gories (Figure 2) based mainly on image resolution,
features, and of course, price. The image resolution is
measured in pixels (short for picture element). The image
quality increases with the number of pixels. The image
resolution usually is measured in megapixels (million of
pixels), often abbreviated as MP. Features of digital cam-
eras include red-eye reduction, zoom, autofocus, flash,
self-timer, and manual mode for fine-tuning settings. You
also may choose to use a personal mobile device to take
your digital pictures. Figure 3 summarizes the three 
categories of digital cameras.
Take Pictures
Digital cameras provide you with several options
that are set before a picture is taken. Three of the more
important options are the resolution, compression, and
image file format in which the camera should save the pic-
ture. While a camera may allow for a very high resolution
for a large print, you may choose to take a picture at a
lower resolution if the image does not require great detail
or must be a small size. For example, you may want to use
the image on a Web page where smaller image file sizes are
beneficial. 
Compression results in smaller image file sizes. Figure
4 illustrates the image file sizes for varying resolutions and
compressions under standard photographic conditions
using a 6-megapixel digital camera. Figure 4 also shows
the average picture size for a given resolution. The camera
may take more time to save an image at lower compres-
sion, resulting in a longer delay before the camera is ready
to take another picture. A higher compression, however,
may result in some loss of image quality. If a camera has a
64 MB flash memory card, you can determine the number
of pictures the card can hold by dividing 64 MB by the file
size. Flash memory cards are available in sizes from 64 MB
to 16 GB or more.
Most digital cameras also allow you to choose an image
file format. Two popular file formats are TIFF and JPEG.
FIGURE 2
The point-and-shoot digital camera usually allows, but
does not require, adjustments before shooting. The field digital camera 
offers improved quality and features that allow you to make manual
adjustments before shooting and use a variety of lenses. The studio 
digital camera offers better color and resolution and greater control 
over exposure and lenses.

DIGITAL IMAGING AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY
The TIFF file format saves the image uncompressed. All of
the image detail is captured and stored, but the file sizes can
be large. Some cameras include a RAW format, which varies
by manufacturer. RAW formats are similar to the TIFF for-
mat in that no compression is done, but, in some cases, the
image is slightly enhanced. The JPEG file format is com-
pressed. The resolution of the image may be the same as a
TIFF file, but some detail may be lost in the image.
Finally, before you take a picture, you should choose
the type of media on which to store the resulting image
file. Some cameras allow for a choice of media to which
you can store the image, such as a CompactFlash card or
Memory Stick, while others allow for only one type of
storage media. One major advantage of a digital camera is
that you easily can erase pictures from its media, freeing
up space for new pictures.
Transfer and Manage Image Files
The method of transferring images from the camera
to the personal computer differs greatly depending on
the capabilities of both. Digital cameras, including per-
sonal mobile devices, use a variety of storage media
(Figure 5). If your camera uses a flash memory card such
as CompactFlash, Memory Stick, SmartMedia, xD Picture
card, Secure Digital (SD), or Mini HD card you can
remove the media from the camera and place it in a slot
on the personal computer or in a device, such as a card
reader, connected to the personal computer. Your camera,
card reader, or personal mobile device also may connect
to the personal computer using a USB, USB 2.0, or
FireWire (Figure 6) port. Other cameras may connect to a
computer using a camera dock or wireless connection.
Some personal computers include an internal card reader.
When you insert the memory card or connect the camera,
software on the personal computer guides you through
the process of transferring the images to the hard disk.
FIGURE 6
Using 
a USB or FireWire
connection, you can add
a card reader to your
personal computer.
FIGURE 5
SD Cards, mini HD cards, CompactFlash Cards, xD
Picture Cards, and mini SD cards are popular storage devices for
digital cameras.
Some operating systems and software recognize a mem-
ory card or camera as though it is another hard disk on
the computer. This feature allows you to access the files,
navigate them, and then copy, delete, or rename the files
while the media still is in the camera.
After you transfer the files to the hard disk on your
personal computer, you should organize the files by sort-
ing them or renaming them so that information, such as
the subject, date, time, and purpose, is saved along with
the image. Finally, before altering the images digitally or
using the images for other purposes, you should back up
the images to another location, such as a CD or DVD, so
that the original image is recoverable.

SPECIAL FEATURE
Edit Images
Image editing software allows you to edit digital
images. You should edit a copy, not the original image file,
so that you always have the original file to use as a backup
or for other editing projects. The following list summarizes
the more common image enhancements or alterations:
• Adjust the contrast and brightness; correct lighting
problems; or help give the photo a particular feeling,
such as warm or stark.
• Remove red-eye.
• Crop an image to remove unnecessary elements and
resize it.
• Rotate the image to change its orientation.
• Add elements to the image, such as descriptive text, 
a date, a logo, or decorative items; create collages or
add missing elements.
• Replace individual colors with a new color.
• Add special effects, such as texture, motion blurring
or reflections to enhance the image.
• Add aging to make the image appear as if it was taken
a long time ago.
• Stitch images together to create a larger image.
Some popular image editing programs are Adobe
Photoshop, Microsoft Photo Story, and Corel Paint Shop Pro
Photo. Figure 7 shows some of the effects available in Corel
Paint Shop Pro X on the Effects submenu.
Print Images
Once an image is altered digitally, it is ready to be
printed. You can print images on a personal color printer
or send them to a professional service that specializes in
digital photo printing.
When printing the images yourself, make sure that 
the resolution used to create the image was high enough
for the size of the print you want to create. For example, 
if the camera used a resolution of 640 3 480 pixels, then
the ideal print size is a wallet size. If you print such an
image at a size of 8 3 10 inches, then the image will
appear pixilated, or blurry. Use high-quality photo paper
for the best results. A photo printer gives the best results
when printing digital photography.
Many services print digital images, either over the
Internet or through traditional photo developing locations
and kiosks (Figure 8), such as those found in drug stores
or shopping marts. Some services allow you to e-mail or
upload the files to the service; specify the size, quality, 
and quantity of print; and then receive the finished prints
via the postal service. Other services allow you to drop 
off flash memory cards or CDs at a photo shop and later
pick up the prints, just as you do with traditional photo
developing shops.

DIGITAL IMAGING AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY
Distribute Images Electronically
Rather than printing images, you often need to use
the images electronically. Depending on the electronic use of
the image, the image may require additional processing. 
If you use the images on a Web site or want to 
e-mail a photo, you probably want to send a
lower-resolution image because a lower resolu-
tion image will be downloaded faster. Image
editing software allows you to lower the reso-
lution of the image, resulting in a smaller
file size. Some photo sharing Web sites
automatically will change the resolution of
your photos for you. You also should use
standard file formats when distributing an
electronic photo. The JPEG format is viewable
using most personal computers or Web
browsers. Some online services allow you 
to upload and share your photos free of
charge and automatically will change your
photos to a lower resolution and JPEG
format. Some personal mobile devices
allow you to send images directly from
the device to an e-mail address,
another personal mobile device, or 
a printer.
You can store very high 
resolution photos on a
DVD or a CD. DVD and
CD mastering software
allows you to create slide
show presentations on a
recordable DVD or CD
that can play in many
home DVD players or
personal computer DVD
drives. Photo sharing
Web sites, such as Fotki
and Flickr (Figure 9),
allow you to share your
photos with acquain-
tances or with the whole
world. You also can
search for and view 
photos of others. 
Finally, you should
back up and store images
that you distribute elec-
tronically with the same
care as you store your
traditional film negatives.
FIGURE 9

in high-definition can be played back on a high-definition 
display. Many personal mobile devices allow you to record
video that you later can transmit to your computer or e-mail
from the device. Digital video cameras provide more features
than analog video cameras, such as a higher level of zoom,
better sound, or greater control over color and lighting.
Record a Video
Most video cameras provide you with a choice of 
recording programs, which sometimes are called automatic 
settings. Each recording program includes a different combina-
tion of camera settings, so that you can adjust the exposure and
other functions to match the recording environment. Usually,
several different programs are available, such as point-and-
shoot, point-and-shoot with manual adjustment, sports, por-
trait, spotlit scenes, and low light. You also have the ability to
select special digital effects, such as fade, wipe, and black and
white. If you are shooting outside on a windy day, then you
can enable the windscreen to prevent wind noise. If you are
shooting home videos or video meant for a Web site, then the
point-and-shoot recording program is sufficient.
Transfer and Manage Videos
After recording the video, the next step is to transfer the
video to your personal computer. Most video cameras connect
directly to a USB 2.0 or FireWire port on your personal computer
(Figure 11). Transferring video with a digital camera is easy,
because the video already is in a digital format that the com-
puter can recognize. Many personal mobile devices include a
special cable used to connect the device to a personal computer.
FIGURE 10
The high-end consumer digital video camera can
produce professional-grade results. The consumer digital video
camera produces amateur-grade results. The webcasting and

security monitoring.
DIGITAL VIDEO
TECHNOLOGY
Digital video technology allows you to input, edit, manage,
publish, and share your videos using a personal computer.
With digital video technology, you can transform home videos
into Hollywood-style movies by enhancing the videos with
scrolling titles and transitions, cutting out or adding scenes,
and adding background music and voice-over narration. The
following sections outline the steps involved in the process of
using digital video technology.
Select a Video Camera
Video cameras record in either analog or digital 
format. Analog formats include 8mm, Hi8, VHS-C, and
Super VHS-C. Digital formats include Mini-DV, MICROMV,
Digital8, DVD, and HDV (high-definition video format).
Some digital video cameras record to an internal hard disk.
Others may allow you to record directly on a DVD. Digital
video cameras fall into three general categories: high-end
consumer, consumer, and webcasting and monitoring (Figure
10). Consumer digital video cameras are by far the most
popular type among consumers. High-end consumer 
models may support the HDV standard. A video recorded

Many people own analog format video tapes that
require additional hardware to convert the analog signals
to a digital format before the video can be manipulated on
a personal computer. The additional hardware includes a
special video capture card using a standard RCA video
cable or an S-video cable (Figure 12). S-video cables pro-
vide sharper images and greater overall quality. A personal
computer also can record video to a CD or DVD, or it can
be connected to an external DVD recorder to record
videos.
When transferring video, plan to use approximately 
15 to 30 GB of hard disk storage space per hour of digital
video. A typical video project requires about four times the
amount of raw footage as the final product. Therefore, at the
high end, a video that lasts an hour may require up to 120
GB of storage for the raw footage, editing process, and final
video. This storage requirement can vary depending on the
software you use to copy the video from the video camera
to the hard disk and the format you select to save the video.
For example, Microsoft’s Windows Movie Maker can save
15 hours of standard video in 10 GB when creating video
for playback on a computer, but saves only 1 hour of video
in 10 GB when creating video for playback on a DVD. A
high-definition video file may require over 10 GB per hour.

SPECIAL FEATURE
Edit a Video
Once the video is stored on your hard disk, the next
step is to edit, or manipulate, the video. If you used a video
capture card to transfer analog video to your computer
(Figure 12 on the previous page), the files may require 
extra initial processing. When you use a video capture 
card, some of the video frames may be lost in the transfer
process. Some video editing programs allow you to fix 
this problem with frame rate correction tools.
The first step in the editing process is to split the video
into smaller pieces, or scenes, that you can manipulate
more easily. This process is called splitting. Most video
software automatically splits the video into scenes, thus
sparing you the task. After splitting, you should cut out
unwanted scenes or portions of scenes. This process is
called pruning.
After you create the scenes you want to use in your
final production, you edit each individual scene. You can
crop, or change the size of, scenes. That is, you may want to
The video transfer requires application software on the
personal computer (Figure 13). Windows Vista includes the
Windows Movie Maker software that allows you to trans-
fer the video from your video camera. Depending on the
length of video and the type of connection used, the video
may take a long time to transfer. Make certain that no other
programs are running on your personal computer while
transferring the video. 
The frame rate of a video refers to the number of
frames per second (fps) that are captured in the video. The
most widely used frame rate is 30 fps. A smaller frame rate
results in a smaller file size for the video, but playback of
the video will not be as smooth as one recorded with a
higher frame rate. 
When transferring video, the software may allow you
to choose a file format and a codec to store the video. A
video file format holds the video information in a manner
specified by a vendor, such as Apple or Microsoft. Four of
the more popular file formats are listed in Figure 14. 
File formats support codecs to encode the audio and
video into the file formats. A codec specifies how the
audio and video is compressed and stored within the file.
A particular file format may be able to store audio and
video in a number of different codecs. Figure 15 shows
some options available for specifying a file format and
video quality settings in a video capture program. The file
format and codec you choose often is based on what you
plan to do with the movie. For example, if you plan to
upload your video to the YouTube video sharing Web site,
the best choices are DivX and MP4 file formats.
After transferring the video to a personal computer,
and before manipulating the video, you should store the
video files in appropriate folders, named correctly, and
backed up. Most video transfer application software helps
manage these tasks.

DIGITAL IMAGING AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY
cut out the top or a side of a scene that is irrelevant. You
also can resize the scene. For example, you may be creating
a video that will be displayed in a Web browser. Making a
smaller video, such as 320 3 200 pixels instead of 640 3 480
pixels, results in a smaller file that transmits faster over the
Internet. Some video sharing Web sites recommend smaller
video resolutions, such as 320 3 200 pixels.
If video has been recorded over a long period, using
different cameras or under different lighting conditions,
the video may need color correction. Color correction tools
(Figure 16) analyze your video and match brightness, col-
ors, and other attributes of video clips to ensure a smooth
look to the video.
You can add logos, special effects, or titles
to scenes. You can place a company logo or
personal logo in a video to identify yourself 
or the company producing the video. Logos
often are added on the lower-right corner of a 
video and remain for the duration of the video.
Special effects include warping, changing from
color to black and white, morphing, or zoom
motion. Morphing is a special effect in which
one video image is transformed into another
image over the course of several frames of
video, creating the illusion of metamorphosis.
You usually add titles at the beginning and end
of a video to give the video context. A training
video may have titles throughout the video to
label a particular scene, or each scene may
begin with a title.
The next step in editing a video is to add
audio effects, including voice-over narration

Color correction tools in video editing software allow a great deal of control over the mood of your video creation.
and background music. Many video editing programs
allow you to add additional tracks, or layers, of sound 
to a video in addition to the sound that was recorded on
the video camera. You also can add special audio effects.
The final step in editing a video is to combine the
scenes into a complete video (Figure 17). This process
involves ordering scenes and adding transition effects
between scenes. Video editing software allows you to

ion. Transitions include fading, wiping, blurry, bursts, 
ruptures, erosions, and more.

SPECIAL FEATURE
Distribute the Video
After editing the video, the final step is to distribute
it or save it on an appropriate medium. You can save video
in a variety of formats. Using special hardware, you can
save the video on standard video tape. A digital-to-analog
converter is necessary to allow your personal computer to
transmit video to a VCR. A digital-to-analog converter may
be an external device that connects to both the computer
and input device, or may be a video capture card inside
the computer. 
Video also can be stored in digital formats in any of
several DVD formats, on CD, on a media sharing Web site,
or on video CD (VCD). DVD or CD creation software,
which often is packaged with video editing software,
allows you to create, or master, DVDs and CDs. You can
add interactivity to your DVDs. For example, you can
allow viewers to jump to certain scenes using a menu. A
video CD (VCD) is a CD format that stores video on a 
CD-R that can be played in many DVD players. 
You also can save your video creation in electronic
format for distribution over the Web, via e-mail, or to a
personal mobile device. Popular media sharing Web sites,
such as YouTube (Figure 18), have recommendations for
the best file format and codecs to use for video that you
upload to them (Figure 19). Your video editing software
must support the file format and codec you want to use.
Apple’s iMovie software typically saves files in the
QuickTime file format.
Professionals use hardware and software that allow
them to create a film version of digital video that can be
played in movie theaters. This technology is becoming
increasingly popular. The cost of professional video editing
software ranges from thousands to hundreds of thousands
of dollars. Video editing software for the home user is avail-
able for a few hundred dollars or less. Some Hollywood
directors believe that eventually, all movies will be recorded
and edited digitally.
After creating your final video for distribution or your
personal video collection, you should back up the final
video file. You can save your scenes for inclusion in other
video creations or create new masters using different
effects, transitions, and ordering of scenes.

homework assignments, recipes, digital photos, music, and videos. A business user accesses 
many stored items, including customer orders and invoices, vendor payments, payroll records,
tax data, inventory records, presentations, digital photos, contracts, marketing literature, contacts,
appointments, schedules, e-mail messages, and Web pages. Other users store diagrams, drawings,

blueprints, designs, marketing literature, corporate newsletters, product catalogs, and multimedia
presentations. All computers also store system and application software.
Storage requirements among users vary greatly. Home users typically have much smaller stor-
age requirements than business users. For example, a home user may need 320 billion bytes of
storage, while large businesses may require 50 quadrillion bytes of storage. 
A storage medium (media is the plural), also called secondary storage, is the physical material
on which a computer keeps data, instructions, and information. Examples of storage media are
hard disks, CDs and DVDs, PC Cards and ExpressCard modules, flash memory cards, USB flash
drives, smart cards, and microfilm (Figure 6-1).

Capacity is the number of bytes (characters) a storage medium can hold. Figure 6-2 identifies
the terms manufacturers use to define the capacity of storage media. For example, a reasonably
priced USB flash drive can store up to 1 GB of data (approximately one billion bytes) and a typi-
cal hard disk has 320 GB (approximately 320 billion bytes) of storage capacity.
A storage device is the computer hardware that records and/or retrieves items to and from 
storage media. Writing is the process of transferring data, instructions, and information from mem-
ory to a storage medium. Reading is the process
of transferring these items from a storage
medium into memory. When storage devices
write data on storage media, they are creating
output. Similarly, when storage devices read
from storage media, they function as a source of
input. Nevertheless, they are categorized as
storage devices, not as input or output devices.
The speed of storage devices is defined by
access time. Access time measures the amount
of time it takes a storage device to locate an item
on a storage medium. The access time of storage
devices is slow, compared with the access time
of memory. Memory (chips) accesses items in
billionths of a second (nanoseconds). Storage
devices, by contrast, access items in thousandths
of a second (milliseconds) or millionths of a 
second (microseconds). 
MAGNETIC DISKS
Magnetic disks use magnetic particles to store items such as data, instructions, and information
on a disk’s surface. Depending on how the magnetic particles are aligned, they represent either a
0 bit or a 1 bit. 
Magnetic disks store data and instructions in tracks and sectors (Figure 6-3). A track is a narrow
recording band that forms a full circle on the surface of the disk. The disk’s storage locations con-
sist of pie-shaped sections, which break the tracks into small arcs called sectors. On a magnetic
disk, a sector typically stores up to 512 bytes of data.
A widely used type of magnetic disk is a hard disk.
Some magnetic disks are portable; others are not. With
respect to a storage medium, the term portable means
you can remove the medium from one
computer and carry it to another
computer.

Hard Disks
A hard disk is a storage device that contains one or more inflexible, circular platters that store
data, instructions, and information. People use hard disks to store all types of documents, spread-
sheets, presentations, databases, e-mail messages, Web pages, digital photos, music, videos, and
software. Businesses use hard disks to store correspondence, reports, financial records, e-mail mes-
sages, customer orders and invoices, payroll records, inventory records, presentations, contracts,
marketing literature, schedules, and Web sites.
The system unit on most desktop and notebook computers contains at least one hard disk. The
entire device is enclosed in an airtight, sealed case to protect it from contamination. A hard disk
that is mounted inside the system unit sometimes is called a fixed disk because it is not portable
(Figure 6-4).
Current personal computer hard disks
have storage capacities from 160 GB to 
1 TB and more. Traditionally, hard disks
stored data using longitudinal recording,
which aligned the magnetic particles
horizontally around the surface of the
disk. With perpendicular recording, by
contrast, hard disks align the magnetic
particles vertically, or perpendicular to
the disk’s surface, making much greater
storage capacities possible. Experts esti-
mate that hard disks using perpendicular
recording will provide storage capacities
about 10 times greater than disks that 
use longitudinal recording. Read 
Looking Ahead 6-1 for a look at the 
next generation of hard disk storage
capacities.
Hard disks are read/write storage
media. That is, you can read from and
write on a hard disk any number of times.
223
MAGNETIC DISKS
Heat Increases Disk Capacity
Things are heating up in the data storage industry. Engineers at IBM Research are testing the use of heat to
record data inexpensively on magnetic media, such as hard disks.
Within the next few years, the researchers predict that this new technique will allow storage of more than
one terabit per square inch, which is the equivalent of 25 DVDs on an area the size of a postage stamp. With
this capacity, a hard disk that can store seven terabits will be commonplace.
IBM calls this new storage system Millipede. It uses heated tips mounted on the ends of cantilevers, in a
fashion similar to the way the stylus on an old phonograph sat on the grooves of vinyl records. For more

CHARACTERISTICS OF A HARD DISK
Characteristics of a hard disk include capacity, platters,
read/write heads, cylinders, sectors and tracks, revolutions per minute, transfer rate, and access
time. Figure 6-5 shows sample characteristics of a 500 GB hard disk. The following paragraphs 
discuss each of these characteristics.
The capacity of a hard disk is determined from the number of platters it contains, together
with composition of the magnetic coating on the platters. A platter is made of aluminum, glass,
or ceramic and is coated
with an alloy material that
allows items to be recorded
magnetically on its surface.
The coating usually is three
millionths of an inch thick.
On desktop computers,
platters most often have a
size of approximately 3.5
inches in diameter. A typical
hard disk has multiple plat-
ters stacked on top of one
another. Each platter has
two read/write heads, one
for each side. The hard disk
has arms that move the
read/write heads to the
proper location on the 
platter (Figure 6-6).
224

Step 1:
The circuit board controls
the movement of the head 
actuator and a small motor.
Step 2:
A small motor spins the platters while 
the computer is running.
Step 3:
When software requests a disk access, the 
read/write heads determine the current or 
new location of the data.
Step 4: 
The head actuator positions the 
read/write head arms over the 
correct location on the platters
to read or write data.

The location of the read/write heads often is referred to by its cylinder. A cylinder is the vertical
section of a track that passes through all platters (Figure 6-7). A single movement of the read/
write head arms accesses all the platters in a cylinder. If a hard disk has two platters (four sides),
each with 1,000 tracks, then it will have 1,000 cylinders with each cylinder consisting of 4 tracks
(2 tracks for each platter). 
While the computer is running, the platters in
the hard disk rotate at a high rate of speed. This
spinning, which usually is 5,400 to 15,000 revo-
lutions per minute (rpm), allows nearly instant
access to all tracks and sectors on the platters.
The platters typically continue to spin until
power is removed from the computer. (On many
computers, the hard disk stops spinning or
slows down after a specified time to save
power.) The spinning motion creates a cushion
of air between the platter and its read/write
head. This cushion ensures that the read/write
head floats above the platter instead of making
direct contact with the platter surface. The dis-
tance between the read/write head and the plat-
ter is about two millionths of one inch.
As shown in Figure 6-8, this close clearance
leaves no room for any type of contamination.
Dirt, hair, dust, smoke, and other particles could
cause the hard disk to have a head crash. A head
crash occurs when a read/write head touches the
surface of a platter, usually resulting in a loss of
data or sometimes loss of the entire drive. Thus,
it is crucial that you back up your hard disk regu-
larly. A backup is a duplicate of a file, program,
or disk placed on a separate storage medium that
you can use in case the original is lost, damaged,
or destroyed. Chapter 7 discusses backup tech-
niques. Access time for today’s hard disks ranges
from approximately 3 to 12 ms (milliseconds).

RAID Some personal computer manufacturers provide a hard disk configuration that connects 
multiple smaller disks into a single unit that acts like a single large hard disk. A group of two or
more integrated hard disks is called a RAID (redundant array of independent disks). RAID is an
ideal storage solution for users who must have the data available when they attempt to access it. 
MINIATURE HARD DISKS
Many mobile devices and consumer electronics include miniature hard
disks to provide users with greater storage capacities than flash memory. These tiny hard disks,
which are smaller than the notebook computer hard disks, often have form factors of 1.8 inch, 
1 inch, and 0.85 inch (Figure 6-9). Devices such as portable media players, digital cameras, and smart
phones often have built-in miniature hard disks. Another type of miniature hard disk, often called a
pocket hard drive, is a self-contained unit that you insert in and remove from a slot in a device or a
computer or plug in a USB port on a computer (Figure 6-10). Miniature hard disks have storage
capacities that range from 4 GB to 250 GB.
EXTERNAL AND REMOVABLE HARD DISKS
An external hard disk, shown in the left picture in
Figure 6-11, is a separate free-standing hard disk that connects with a cable to a USB port or
FireWire port on the system unit. As with the internal hard disk, the entire hard disk is enclosed
in an airtight, sealed case. External hard disks have storage capacities of up to 2 TB and more.
Some external hard disk units include multiple hard disks that you can use for different purposes,
if desired.
A removable hard disk is a hard disk that you insert and remove from a drive. A removable
hard disk drive, shown in the right picture in Figure 6-11, reads from and writes on the removable
hard disk. Removable hard disks have storage capacities up to 750 GB.

External and removable hard disks offer the following advantages over internal hard disks
(fixed disks):
• Transport a large number of files
• Back up important files or an entire internal hard disk (several external hard disk models allow
you to back up simply by pushing a button on the disk)
• Easily store large audio and video files
• Secure your data; for example, at the end of a work session, remove the hard disk and lock it
up, leaving no data in the computer
• Add storage space to a notebook computer or Tablet PC
• Add storage space to a desktop computer without having to open the system unit
• Share a drive with multiple computers
As the prices of external and removable hard disks drop, increasingly more users are 
purchasing one to supplement a home or office internal hard disk. 
HARD DISK CONTROLLERS
A disk controller consists of a special-purpose chip and electronic
circuits that control the transfer of data, instructions, and information from a disk to and from the
system bus and other components in the computer. That is, it controls the interface between the hard
disk and the system bus. A disk controller for a hard disk, called the hard disk controller, may be
part of a hard disk or the motherboard, or it may be a separate adapter card inside the system unit.
In their personal computer advertisements, vendors usually state the type of hard disk interface
supported by the hard disk controller. Thus, you should understand the types of available hard disk
interfaces. In addition to USB and FireWire (external hard disk interfaces), four other types of hard
disk interfaces for internal use in personal computers are SATA, EIDE, SCSI, and SAS.
• SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) uses serial signals to transfer data,
instructions, and information. The primary advantage of SATA interfaces is their cables are
thinner, longer, more flexible, and less susceptible to interference than cables used by hard
disks that use parallel signals. SATA interfaces also support connections to CD and DVD drives.
• EIDE (Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics) is a hard disk interface that uses parallel signals to
transfer data, instructions, and information. EIDE interfaces can support up to four hard disks at
137 GB per disk. EIDE interfaces also provide connections for CD and DVD drives and tape drives. 
• SCSI interfaces, which also use parallel signals, can support up to eight or fifteen peripheral
devices. Supported devices include hard disks, CD and DVD drives, tape drives, printers,
scanners, network cards, and much more. Some computers have a built-in SCSI interface, while
others use an adapter card to add a SCSI interface.
• SAS (serial-attached SCSI) is a newer type of SCSI that uses serial signals to transfer data,
instructions, and information. Advantages of SAS over parallel SCSI include thinner, longer
cables; reduced interference; less expensive; support for many more connected devices at once;
and faster speeds. In addition to hard disks, SAS interfaces support connections to CD and
DVD drives, printers, scanners, digital cameras, and other devices. Experts predict that SAS
eventually will replace parallel SCSI.

Can airport security screening equipment damage or erase the data on my hard disk 
or other media?
The Transportation Security Administration’s Web site states that their screening (x-ray) equipment will not damage or erase the data stored
on hard disks CDs, DVDs, or the miniature storage media used in digital cameras. Although your media is equally safe whether you carry it
onto the airplane or leave it in checked baggage, packing it with your carry-on items is a better safeguard against physical damage. If you
are uneasy about your media passing through the airport screening equipment, you may be able to request that the items be manually
(hand) searched. It is important to note that the equipment used to screen checked baggage will not harm electronic media, but it will dam-
age undeveloped film. As a safeguard, you should carry all film onto the airplane and request a manual search. For more information, visit
scsite.com/dcf5e/ch6/faq and then click Airport Screening Equipment.
FAQ 6-1
C6672_CH06 pp4  1/30/08  2:16 PM  Page 227

ONLINE STORAGE
Some users choose online storage instead of storing data locally on a hard
disk. Online storage is a service on the Web that provides hard disk storage to computer users,
for free or for a minimal monthly fee (Figure 6-12). Fee arrangements vary. For example, one
online storage service provides 5 GB of storage free to registered users; another charges $10 per
month for 5 GB of storage. 
Users subscribe to an online storage service for a variety of reasons:
• To access files on the Internet hard disk from any computer or device that has Internet access
• To allow others to access files on their Internet hard disk so that others can listen to an audio
file, watch a video clip, or view a picture — instead of e-mailing the file to them
• To view time-critical data and images immediately while away from the main office or location;
for example, doctors can view x-ray images from another hospital, home, or office 
• To store offsite backups of data
Once users subscribe to the online storage service, they can save on the Internet hard disk in the
same manner they save on their local hard disk. 
Floppy Disks
A floppy disk, also called a diskette, is a portable, inexpensive storage medium that consists of
a thin, circular, flexible plastic Mylar film with a magnetic coating enclosed in a square-shaped
plastic shell. A typical floppy disk is 3.5 inches wide and has
storage capacities up to 1.44 MB. Floppy disks are not as
widely used as they were 15 years ago because of their low
storage capacity. 
A floppy disk drive is a device that reads from and writes 
on a floppy disk. A user inserts a floppy disk in and removes 
it from a floppy disk drive. Because computers today do not
include a floppy disk drive as standard equipment, you can
use an external floppy disk drive, in which the drive is a sepa-
rate device with a cable that plugs in a port on the system unit
(Figure 6-13). These external drives are attached to the com-
puter only when the user needs to access items on a floppy
disk. You can read from and write on a floppy disk any 
number of times.

OPTICAL DISCS
An optical disc is a type of optical storage media that consists
of a flat, round, portable, disc made of metal, plastic, and lac-
quer. These discs usually are 4.75 inches in diameter and less
than one-twentieth of an inch thick. 
Optical discs primarily store software, data, digital 
photos, movies, and music. Some optical disc formats are
read only, meaning users cannot write (save) on the media.
Others are read/write, which allows users to save on the disc
just as they save on a hard disk. 
Nearly every personal computer today includes some type
of optical disc drive installed in a drive bay. On these drives,
you push a button to slide out a tray, insert the disc, and then
push the same button to close the tray (Figure 6-14). Other
convenient features on most of these drives include a volume
control button and a headphone port (or jack) so that you 
can use headphones to listen to audio without disturbing
others nearby.
With some discs, you can read and/or write on one side
only. Manufacturers usually place a silk-screened label on
the top layer of these single-sided discs. You insert a single-
sided disc in the drive with the label side up. Other discs are
double-sided. Simply remove the disc from the drive, flip it
over, and reinsert it in the drive to use the other side of the
disc. Double-sided discs often have no label; instead each
side of the disc is identified with small writing around the
center of the disc. Some drives use LightScribe technology,
which works with specially coated optical discs, to etch
labels directly on the disc (as opposed to placing an 
adhesive label on the disc).
Optical discs store items by using microscopic pits 
(indentations) and lands (flat areas) that are in the middle
layer of the disc. A high-powered laser light creates the pits.
A lower-powered laser light reads items from the disc by
reflecting light through the bottom of the disc, which usu-
ally is either solid gold or silver in color. The reflected light
is converted into a series of bits the computer can process.

Yes, you can remove dust, dirt, smudges, and fingerprints from the bottom surface of a CD or DVD.
Moisten a nonabrasive cloth with warm water or rubbing alcohol and then wipe the disc in straight lines
from the center outward. You also can repair scratches on the bottom surface with a specialized disc repair
kit. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch6/faq and then click Cleaning and Repairing Discs.

Manufacturers claim that a properly cared
for high-quality optical disc will last 5 years
but could last up to 100 years. Figure 6-15
offers some guidelines for the proper care of
optical discs. 
Many different formats of optical discs exist
today. Figure 6-16 identifies a variety of optical
disc formats and specifies whether a user can
read from the disc, write to the disc, and/or
erase the disc. The following sections describe
characteristics unique to each of these disc for-
mats. Read Looking Ahead 6-2 for a look at the
future of optical disc technology.

CD-ROMs
A CD-ROM (pronounced SEE-DEE-rom), or compact disc read-only memory, is a type of
optical disc that users can read but not write (record) or erase — hence, the name read-only.
Manufacturers write the contents of standard CD-ROMs. A standard CD-ROM is called a 
single-session disc because manufacturers write all items on the disc at one time. Software 
manufacturers often distribute programs using CD-ROMs (Figure 6-17).
A typical CD-ROM holds from 650 MB to 1 GB of data, instructions, and information. To
read a CD-ROM, insert the disc in a CD-ROM drive or a CD-ROM player. Because audio CDs
and CD-ROMs use the same laser technology, you may be able to use a CD-ROM drive to
listen to an audio CD while using the computer.

Interactive Gift Cards Provide Marketing Opportunities
Finding the perfect gift for a finicky friend or for a person who seems to have everything can be quite
a problem. Gift cards can solve this dilemma. Consumers spend more than $25 million on gift cards
during the holiday season, making this item the most popular present among consumers of all ages.
Today’s plastic gift cards may one day become optical discs, complete with interactive activities for
the recipient. EnXnet is developing ThinDisc technology to create a Multimedia Gift Card that, when
played on a computer, can display detailed product information, games, online promotions, printable
coupons, and Web links.
The optical disc gift card also may have other uses, including functioning as an interactive room
key at hotels and resorts. Guests can open their hotel door and then play the key on their computer to
view content provided by the hotel, such as a destination video and exclusive online discounts and
promotions. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch6/looking and then click Optical Discs.

CD-Rs and CD-RWs
Many personal computers today include either a CD-R or CD-RW drive as a standard feature.
Unlike standard CD-ROM drives, users record, or write, their own data on a disc with a CD-R or
CD-RW drive. The process of writing on an optical disc is called burning. 
A CD-R (compact disc-recordable) is a multisession optical disc on which users can write, but not
erase, their own items such as text, graphics, and audio. Multisession means you can write on part
of the disc at one time and another part at a later time. Each part of a CD-R can be written on only
one time, and the disc’s contents cannot be erased. Writing on the CD-R requires a CD recorder or a
CD-R drive. A CD-R drive usually can read both audio CDs and standard CD-ROMs.

HOW AN ARCHIVE CD WORKS
ARCHIVE CDS AND PICTURE CDS
Many people use Archive CDs or Picture CDs to preserve their
photos. When you post and share photos online on a photo sharing community, you can choose to
save your collection of online photos on an Archive CD, which stores photos in the jpg file format
(Figure 6-18). The cost of Archive CDs is determined by the number of photos being stored. One
service, for example, charges $7 for every hundred pictures.
A Kodak Picture CD stores digital versions of film using a jpg file format. Many photo centers
offer Picture CD service for consumers when they drop off film to be developed. The additional
cost for a Picture CD is about $3 per roll of film. 
Most optical disc drives can read an Archive CD and a Picture CD. You can print copies of the
photos from the CD on paper with an ink-jet printer. If you do not have a printer to print the
images, many stores have kiosks at which you can print pictures from an Archive CD, a Picture CD,
or other media.

Is the Blu-ray and HD DVD Competition Good for Consumers?
In the early 1980s, a battle raged over the VHS and Betamax video tape formats. Eventually, the VHS format won over
the hearts and dollars of consumers despite experts’ claims of the superiority of the Betamax format, and the Betamax
format remains a footnote in the history of consumer electronics. Today, a similar rivalry exists between the Blu-ray and
HD DVD formats as two competing groups of consumer electronic corporate giants vie to get their players and discs in
your home. 
Some differences exist between the standards. While a Blu-ray Disc (BD) can hold more data than an HD DVD disc, the
HD DVD players are much less expensive and still include enough capacity to hold a high-definition movie. HD DVD discs are
less expensive to make, though more movie studios have announced support for Blu-ray. Some consumer advocates claim
that the competition between the standards will benefit consumers as each side tries to win through lower prices and more
features. Others claim that two standards hurt consumers because some movie studios, computer companies, and software
providers will choose to support only one format. If this happens, consumers may choose to purchase both types of devices
or, in frustration, not purchase a player at all. Recently, though, some manufacturers released players that support both for-
mats. Is the availability of two high-definition DVD formats good for consumers? Why or why not? Do you think that prices
will go up if one format eventually wins over the other? Why or why not? With limited shelf space, how should video rental
and retail stores cope with keeping both formats for a movie in stock?
A CD-RW (compact disc-rewritable) is an erasable multisession disc you can write on multiple times. To
write on a CD-RW disc, you must have CD-RW software and a CD-RW drive. A popular use of CD-RW
and CD-R discs is to create audio CDs. For example, users can record their own music and save it on a CD,
purchase and download songs from the Web, or rearrange tracks on a purchased music CD. The process of
copying audio and/or video data from a purchased disc and saving it on digital media is called ripping.
DVD-ROMs, BD-ROMs, and HD DVD-ROMs
A DVD-ROM (digital versatile disc-read-only memory or digital video
disc-read-only memory) is a high-capacity optical disc on which users can 
read but not write or erase. Manufacturers write the contents of DVD-ROMs
and distribute them to consumers. DVD-ROMs store movies, music, huge
databases, and complex software (Figure 6-19).
To read a DVD-ROM, you must have a DVD-ROM drive or DVD player.
Most DVD-ROM drives also can read audio CDs, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, and 
CD-RWs. Some drives, called DVD/CD-RW drives, are combination drives 
that read DVD and CD media.
A DVD-ROM uses one of three storage techniques. The first involves mak-
ing the disc denser by packing the pits closer together. The second involves
using two layers of pits. For this technique to work, the lower layer of pits 
is semitransparent so that the laser can read through it to the upper layer. 
This technique doubles the capacity of the disc. Finally, some DVD-ROMs 
are double-sided. Two newer, more expensive competing DVD formats are
Blu-ray and HD DVD, both of which are higher capacity and better quality 
than standard DVDs. A Blu-ray Disc (BD) has storage capaci-
ties of 100 GB, with expectations of exceeding 200 GB in the
future. The HD DVD disc, which stands for high-density-
DVD, has storage capacities up to 60 GB with future projec-
tions of 90 GB capacities. Figure 6-20 compares the current
storage capacities of DVD-ROM, BD-ROM, and HD DVD-
ROM media (read Ethics & Issues 6-1 for a related discus-
sion). Another high density format, called HD VMD
(Versatile Multilayer Disc) potentially will contain up to 
20 layers, each with a capacity of 5 GB. Current HD VMDs
have capacities of 40 GB and more.

A mini-DVD that has grown in popularity is the UMD, which works specifically with the
PlayStation Portable handheld game console. The UMD (Universal Media Disc), which has a 
diameter of about 2.4 inches, can store up to 1.8 GB of games, movies, or music.
Recordable and Rewritable DVDs
Many types of recordable and rewritable DVD formats are available. DVD-R, DVD+R, BD-R, 
and HD DVD-R allow users to write on the disc once and read (play) it many times. DVD-RW,
DVD+RW, and DVD+RAM are three competing rewritable DVD formats. Similarly, BD-RE and
HD DVD-RW are competing high-capacity rewritable DVD formats. To write on these discs,
you must have a compatible drive or recorder. 
Rewritable DVD drives usually can read a variety of DVD and CD media. Before investing in
equipment, check to be sure it is compatible with the media on which you intend to record.
As the cost of DVD technologies becomes more reasonable, many industry professionals expect
that DVD eventually will replace all CD media.

TAPE
One of the first storage media used with mainframe computers was tape. Tape is a magnetically
coated ribbon of plastic capable of storing large amounts of data and information at a low cost.
Tape no longer is used as a primary method of storage. Instead, business users utilize tape most
often for long-term storage and backup.
A tape drive reads and writes data and information on a tape. Although older computers used
reel-to-reel tape drives, today’s tape drives use tape cartridges. A tape cartridge is a small, rectan-
gular, plastic housing for tape (Figure 6-21). Tape cartridges that contain quarter-inch-wide tape
are slightly larger than audiocassette tapes.

Business users sometimes back up personal computer hard disks to tape, often using an external
tape drive. On larger computers, tape cartridges are mounted in a separate cabinet called a tape
library.
Tape storage requires sequential access, which refers to reading or writing data consecutively.
As with a music tape, you must forward or rewind the tape to a specific point to access a specific
piece of data.
Hard disks, CDs, and DVDs all use direct access. Direct access means that the device can locate
a particular data item or file immediately, without having to move consecutively through items
stored in front of the desired data item or file. When writing or reading specific data, direct access
is much faster than sequential access.
PC CARDS AND EXPRESSCARD MODULES
A PC Card is a thin, credit-card-sized removable flash memory device that fits into a PC Card slot.
An ExpressCard module is a removable device, smaller than a PC Card, that fits in an ExpressCard
slot. PC Cards and ExpressCard modules can be used to add memory, storage, communications,
multimedia, and security capabilities to a computer. PC Cards and ExpressCard modules commonly
are used in notebook computers.
PC Cards are about 86 mm long and 54 mm wide. ExpressCard modules, by contrast, are either
rectangular at 75 mm long and 34 mm wide or L-shaped with a width of 54 mm (Figure 6-22). 
MINIATURE MOBILE STORAGE MEDIA
Miniature mobile storage media allow mobile users easily to transport digital images, music, or
documents to and from computers and other devices. Many desktop computers, notebook com-
puters, Tablet PCs, digital cameras, portable media players, smart phones, and other personal
mobile devices have built-in ports or slots to hold miniature mobile storage media. For computers
or devices without built-in slots, users insert the media in separate peripherals such as card
reader/writers, which typically plugs in a USB port. Three types of miniature mobile storage 
media include flash memory cards, USB flash drives, and smart cards.

Flash Memory Cards
Common types of flash memory cards include CompactFlash (CF), Secure Digital (SD), 
microSD, miniSD, xD Picture Card, and Memory Stick. The table in Figure 6-23 compares 
storage capacities and uses of these miniature mobile storage media. Depending on the device,
manufacturers claim miniature mobile storage media can last from 10 to 100 years.
To view, edit, or print images and information stored on miniature mobile storage media, you
transfer the contents to your desktop computer or other device. Some printers have slots to read
flash memory cards. If your computer or printer does not have a built-in slot, you can purchase a
card reader/writer, which is a device that reads and writes data, instructions, and information
stored on flash memory cards. Card reader/writers usually connect to the USB port or FireWire port
on the system unit. The type of card you have will determine the type of card reader/writer needed.

Can I take pictures faster if I use a high-speed memory card?
When you take a picture with a digital camera, the camera captures the image, processes the image, and then saves the image to the
memory card. High-speed memory cards only decrease the time that it takes to save the image to the card, and not the time necessary to
capture and process the image. A high-speed memory card, however, will allow you to take more photos in a short amount of time. For
more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch6/faq and then click Memory Card Speed. 
FAQ 6-3
USB Flash Drives
A USB flash drive, sometimes called a pen drive or thumb
drive, is a flash memory storage device that plugs in a USB
port on a computer or mobile device (Figure 6-24). USB
flash drives are convenient for mobile users because
they are small and lightweight enough to be trans-
ported on a keychain or in a pocket. USB flash drives
have become the mobile user’s primary storage device,
making the floppy disk nearly obsolete because they
have much greater storage capacities and are much more
convenient to carry. Current USB flash drives have storage
capacities ranging from 256 MB to 64 GB, with the latter being
extremely expensive.
Smart Cards
A smart card, which is similar in size to a credit card 
or ATM card (Figure 6-25), stores data on a thin micro-
processor embedded in the card. Smart cards contain a
processor and have input, process, output, and storage
capabilities. When you insert the smart card in a special-
ized card reader, the information on the smart card is 
read and, if necessary, updated. Uses of smart cards
include storing medical records, vaccination data, and
other health care or identification information; tracking
information such as customer purchases or employee
attendance; storing a prepaid amount of money, such as
for student purchases on campus; and authenticating
users such as for Internet purchases or building access. 
In addition, smart cards can double as an ID card. Read

Should the World Become a Cashless Society?
Do you toss your loose change in a jar with the hopes of making a special purchase with the savings someday? This habit may become futile
if the world goes cashless. One form of payment that could end the need for cash is the smart card, which can store a dollar amount on a
thin microprocessor and update the amount whenever a transaction is made. Advocates claim that smart cards would eliminate muggings
and robberies, make it difficult to purchase illegal goods, and reduce taxes by identifying tax cheats. Also, payment using biometrics, such as
fingerprints, is becoming more common. Several high-profile security breaches at credit reporting and credit card companies, however, have
heightened concerns over privacy. In a recent survey, most Americans said that they would not use a smart card even if privacy was guaran-
teed. Another survey shows that most Americans believe that fingerprints are a trustworthy form of identification. A cash purchase usually is
anonymous. Yet, a smart card purchase preserves a record of the transaction that could become available to other merchants, advertisers,
government agencies, or hackers. Considering the advantages and disadvantages, should the world become a cashless society? Why or why
not? Would you be comfortable using a smart card or fingerprint instead of cash for all transactions? Why?

ENTERPRISE STORAGE
A large business, commonly referred to as an enterprise, has hundreds or thousands of employees
in offices across the country or around the world. Enterprises use computers and computer net-
works to manage and store huge volumes of data and information about customers, suppliers,
and employees.
To meet their large-scale needs, enterprises use special hardware geared for heavy use, maxi-
mum availability, and maximum efficiency. One or more servers on the network have the sole
purpose of providing storage to connected users. For high-speed storage access, entire networks
are dedicated exclusively to connecting devices that provide storage to other servers. In an enter-
prise, some storage systems can provide more than 185 TB of storage capacity. CD servers and
DVD servers hold hundreds of CDs or DVDs.
An enterprise’s storage needs usually grow daily. Thus, the storage solutions an enterprise
chooses must be able to store its data and information requirements today and tomorrow. Read

MICROFILM AND MICROFICHE
Microfilm and microfiche store microscopic images of documents on roll or sheet film. Microfilm is
a 100- to 215-foot roll of film. Microfiche is a small sheet of film, usually about 4 3 6 inches. A com-
puter output microfilm recorder is the device that records the images on the film. The stored images
are so small that you can read them only with a microfilm or microfiche reader (Figure 6-26). 
Microfilm and microfiche use is
widespread, with many companies
allowing you to search through and
view microfilm images online. Libraries
use these media to store back issues of
newspapers, magazines, and genealogy
records. Some large organizations use
microfilm and microfiche to archive
inactive files. Some banks use them to
store transactions and canceled checks.
The U.S. Army uses them to store 
personnel records.
The use of microfilm and microfiche
provides a number of advantages. They
greatly reduce the amount of paper
firms must handle. They are inexpen-
sive and have the longest life of any
storage media (Figure 6-27).

Many factors influence the type of storage devices you should use:
the amount of data, instructions, and information to be stored; the
hardware and software in use; and the desired cost. The table in

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Who Should Be
Looking at Your Medical
Records?
A medical transcriber based in a
foreign country and hired by a U.S.
medical center threatened to post pri-
vate medical records to the Internet if
she was not paid more. With the wide-
spread use of computers and an explo-
sion in data storage capacity around
the world, private information, such as
medical records, requires increased
diligence by companies, governments,
and individuals to maintain this pri-
vacy. The government would like most
Americans’ health care records avail-
able in privacy-protected electronic
format by 2014. Although these
records will be stored by a corporation
or the government, individuals proba-
bly will have complete control, or own-
ership, of these electronic records.
Updates to the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) effective in 2003 set rigorous
standards for medical record privacy.
The law, however, still leaves much of
your medical information at risk. The
law does not cover financial records,
education records, or employment
records — each of which may contain
medical information about you. Your
medical information also may be
examined by insurance companies,
government agencies, the Medical
Information Bureau (MIB), employers,
and the courts. You also inadvertently
may pass on medical information to
direct marketers when you participate
in informal health screenings or sur-
veys. Some people have found that
discussing medical conditions via
Internet chat rooms or newsgroups
has resulted in unwanted attention,
and they later regret the disclosures.
Proponents of greater electronic
access to medical records claim that
more access means that physicians
can be better prepared when they see
patients, physicians will make fewer
errors, and insurance companies can
better root out fraud. Should more lim-
its be placed on what other people can
do with your medical information?
Why or why not? What are the advan-
tages of increased access to medical
records? What are the disadvantages?

Who Is Responsible for Maintaining Your Online Storage?
In recent years, online storage services, such as Google Gmail or Google Documents,
began offering greater capacity and security to users for storing and managing their
data. Gmail offers users several gigabytes of free e-mail storage, while Yahoo!’s mail
service provides unlimited storage of e-mail messages. Other services offer storage 
for images, video, and nearly any type of document. Those advocating online storage
services maintain that one’s data is safer with an online storage company because the
company specializes in such technology. The professionals who maintain these serv-
ices are much more knowledgeable about security, backups, and availability of the
service than people typically are about their own personal computers.
Others oppose the use of such services, claiming that the services should not be
used to store sensitive documents because they could be more susceptible to security
breaches. They also stress that a person always should make regular backups of what
they keep stored on the service because if the storage company goes out of business
or suffers a power outage, then a person’s or company’s data may be at risk of becom-
ing unavailable. Who should be responsible for maintaining your online storage? Why?
How can people protect their data if an online storage system becomes unavailable or
the online storage company goes out of business? What role should the government
play in protecting consumers’ online storage? What rights should consumers demand
from online storage companies? Why?

The demand for computer technicians is growing in every organization and industry. For many, this is the entry
point for a career in the computer/information technology field. The responsibilities of a computer technician,
also called a computer service technician, include a variety of duties. Most companies that employ someone
with this title expect the technician to have basic across-the-board knowledge of concepts in the computer elec-
tronics field. Some of the tasks are hardware repair and installation; software installation, upgrade, and configu-
ration; and troubleshooting client and/or server problems. Today’s technicians are capable of viewing your desktop
and sharing control of your mouse and keyboard through remote assistance. Because the computer field is rapidly changing, technicians
must work to remain abreast of current technology and become aware of future developments. Computer technicians generally work with a
variety of users, which requires expert people skills, especially the ability to work with groups of nontechnical users.
Most entry-level computer technicians possess the A+ certification. This certification attests that a computer technician has demon-
strated knowledge of core hardware and operating system technology including installation, configuration, diagnosing, preventive
maintenance, and basic networking that meets industry standards and has at least six months of experience in the field. The
Electronics Technicians Association also provides a Computer Service Technician (CST) certification program.
Because this is an entry-level position, the pay scale is not as high as other more demanding and skilled positions. Individuals can
expect an average annual starting salary of around $36,000 to $50,000. Companies pay more for computer technicians with experience
and certification. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch6/careers and then click Computer Technician.

Seagate Technology
Information Storage Supplier
Consumers understand the need to back up their data, but fewer than 25 percent 
of computer users back up their data on a weekly basis. Hard-disk manufacturer
Seagate has been persuading people to save copies of their important documents 
so that they will suffer less data loss in the event of a fire or natural disaster.
Seagate is a leading manufacturer of hard disks and storage solutions for desk-
top computers, high-performance servers, and consumer electronics, including
digital video recorders and game consoles. 
Seagate unveiled the world’s first 1 TB hard disk in 2007. In that year, the com-
pany also was named the CRN Channel Champion, an honor bestowed to the top
vendor in the server-class disk drive category. For more information, visit
scsite.com/dcf5e/ch6/companies and then click Seagate.
SanDisk Corporation
World’s Largest Flash Memory Card Supplier
The next time you buy milk at the grocery store or shampoo at the drug store, you
might want to purchase a flash memory card for your digital camera, too. SanDisk
Corporation products can be found in more than 200,000 retail stores across the
United States. SanDisk teamed with Sony in 2007 to develop the SxS memory card
specification for high-speed data transfer of large digital video camera files.
With retail sales of flash memory cards soaring, SanDisk executives believe 
consumers buy multiple flash memory cards to store their digital photos in much the
same manner as they formerly stored film negatives in shoe boxes. They also prefer
to take a separate flash memory card to digital photo processing centers, which 
produce high-quality prints.
SanDisk is the only company with the rights to manufacture and sell every flash
card format. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch6/companies and then

Al Shugart
Storage Expert
Al Shugart enjoyed fixing broken items and developing new technology. The day after receiving his bachelor’s degree in
1951, he went to work at IBM to repair broken machines. IBM then promoted him to supervisor of the product development
team that developed the first removable rigid read/write disk drive.
He left IBM in 1969 and went to work as vice president of product development for Memorex. In 1973, he started
Shugart Associates, a pioneer in the manufacture of floppy disks. Six years later he and some associates founded Seagate
Technology, Inc., which is a leader in designing and manufacturing storage products.
He served as president and CEO of Al Shugart International, a venture capital firm in California, until his death in 2006.

Mark Dean
IBM Inventor
The next generation of IBM’s hardware and software might be the work of Mark Dean. As vice president of IBM’s Almaden
Research Center lab in California, Dean is responsible for developing innovative products.
His designs are used in more than 40 million personal computers manufactured each year. He has more than 40 patents
or patents pending, including four of the original seven for the architecture of the original personal computer.
Dean joined IBM in 1979 after graduating at the top of his class at the University of Tennessee. Dean earned his Ph.D.
degree at Stanford, and he headed a team at IBM that invented the first CMOS microprocessor to operate at 1 gigahertz.

Chapter Review
The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students regarding
any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch6/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
What Are the Characteristics of Magnetic Disks?
Magnetic disks use magnetic particles to store items such as data, instructions, and information, which includes pictures,
music, and videos, on a disk’s surface. They store data and instructions in tracks and sectors. A widely used type of 
magnetic disk is a hard disk. Some magnetic disks are portable; others are not.
What Are the Characteristics of a Hard Disk?
A hard disk is a storage device that contains one or more inflexible, circular platters that store data, instructions, and
information. A platter is made of aluminum, glass, or ceramic and is coated with a material that allows items to be
recorded magnetically on its surface. Each platter has two read/write heads, one for each side. The location of a
read/write head often is referred to by its cylinder. A cylinder is the vertical section of a track that passes through all
platters. While the computer is running, the platters rotate at 5,400 to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm), which allows
nearly instant access to all tracks and sectors on the platters. The spinning creates a cushion of air between the platters
and the read/write heads. A head crash occurs when a read/write head touches the surface of a platter, usually resulting
in a loss of data. A backup is a duplicate of a file, program, or disk placed on a separate storage medium that you can
use in case the original is lost, damaged, or destroyed.
What Are the Various Types of Miniature, External, and Removable 
Hard Disks?
Many mobile devices include miniature hard disks that provide greater storage 
capacities than flash memory. A type of miniature hard disk called a pocket 
hard drive is a self-contained unit that fits in a slot in a device or computer or 
plugs in a USB port on a computer. Miniature hard disks have storage capacities 
that range from 4 GB to 250 GB. An external hard disk is a separate free-standing
hard disk that connects with a cable to a USB or FireWire port. External hard 
disks have storage capacities up to 2 TB or more. A removable hard disk can be
inserted or removed from a drive. Removable hard disks have storage capacities 
up to 750 GB.
What Are the Characteristics of Optical Discs?
An optical disc is a type of storage media that consists of a flat, round, portable disc made of metal, plastic, and lacquer.
Optical discs store items by using microscopic pits (indentations) and lands (flat areas). A high-powered laser light
creates the pits, and a lower-powered laser light reads items by reflecting light through the bottom of the disc. 
What Are the Various CD and DVD Formats?
A CD-ROM is an optical disc that users can read but not write (record) or erase. A CD-R is a multisession disc on which
users can write, but not erase. A CD-RW is erasable. An Archive CD is used to store photos from a photo sharing com-
munity in the jpg file format. A Picture CD stores digital versions of film using a jpg file format. A DVD-ROM is a 
high-capacity disc which users can read but not write on or erase. A Blu-ray Disc (BD) currently has storage capacities of
100 GB. The HD DVD disc has storage capacities up to 60 GB. The HD VMD (Versatile Multilayer Disc) is a high-density
format with a capacity of 40 GB or more. The UMD can store up to 1.8 GB of games, movies, or music. DVD-R, DVD+R,
BD-R, and HD DVD-R formats can be written on once. DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD+RAM are three competing 
high-capacity rewritable DVD formats. BD-RE and HD DVD-RW are competing rewritable DVD formats.

How Is Tape Used?
Tape is a magnetically coated ribbon of plastic capable of storing large amounts of data and information at a low cost. 
A tape drive reads and writes data and information on tape. Businesses and home users sometimes back up personal
computer hard disks to tape.
What Are PC Cards, ExpressCard Modules, and Other Types of Miniature Mobile Storage Media?
A PC Card is a thin, credit-card-sized removable flash memory device that fits into a PC Card slot. An ExpressCard module
is a removable device, smaller than a PC Card, that fits in an ExpressCard slot. PC Cards and ExpressCard modules add stor-
age or other capabilities to a computer. Tablet PCs, digital cameras, portable media players, smart phones, and other personal
mobile devices use some form of miniature mobile storage media to store digital images, music, or documents. Common
types of miniature flash memory cards include CompactFlash (CF), Secure Digital (SD), microSD, miniSD, xD Picture Card,
and Memory Stick. A USB flash drive is a flash memory storage device that plugs in a USB port on a computer or mobile
device. A smart card, which is similar in size to a credit card, stores data on a thin microprocessor embedded in the card.
How Are Microfilm and Microfiche Used?
Microfilm is a 100- to 215-foot roll of film. Microfiche is a small sheet of film, usually about 4 3 6 inches. Libraries use
microfilm and microfiche to store back issues of newspapers, magazines, and records; some large organizations use them
to archive inactive files; some banks use them to store transactions and canceled checks; and the U.S. Army uses them to
store personnel records.

LEARN HOW TO 1: Maintain a Hard Disk
A computer’s hard disk is used for the majority of storage requirements. It is important, therefore, to ensure that each hard disk
on a computer is operating at peak efficiency, both to use the available storage space effectively and to make disk operations as
fast as possible.
Three tasks that maximize disk operations are detecting and repairing disk errors by using the Check Disk utility program;
removing unused or unnecessary files and folders by using the Disk Cleanup utility program; and, consolidating files and 
folders into contiguous storage areas using the Disk Defragmenter utility 
program. Defragmenting allows your system to access stored files and folders
more efficiently.
A. Check Disk
To detect and repair disk errors using the Check Disk utility 
program, complete the following steps:
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar and then click 
Computer on the Start menu.
2. When the Computer window opens, right-click the hard disk 
icon for drive C (or any other hard disk you want to select), and 
then click Properties on the shortcut menu.
3. In the Properties dialog box, if necessary click the Tools tab to display 
the Tools sheet. The Tools sheet contains buttons to start the Check 
Disk program, the Defragment program, and the Backup program 
(Figure 6-29).
4. Click the Check Now button to display the Check Disk dialog box. 
5. To do a complete scan of the disk and correct any errors that are found, 
place a check mark in the ‘Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors’ 
check box, and then click the Start button. Four phases of checking the 
disk will occur. While the checking is in progress, the disk being checked
cannot be used for any purpose whatsoever; furthermore, once it has 
started, the process cannot be stopped.
6. When the four phases are complete (this may take more than one-half hour, 
depending on the size of the hard disk and how many corrections must 
occur), a dialog box is displayed with the message, Disk Check Complete. 
Click the OK button in the dialog box to complete the disk check.
B. Cleanup Disk
After checking the disk, your next step can be to clean up the disk 
by removing any programs and data that are not required for the 
computer. To do so, complete the following steps:
1. Click the General tab (Figure 6-29) in the disk drive Properties 
dialog box to display the General sheet.
2. Click the Disk Cleanup button in the General sheet to display the Disk
Cleanup Options dialog box. When the Disk Cleanup Options dialog 
box is displayed, click My files only.
3. The Disk Cleanup dialog box is displayed and contains a message that
indicates the amount of space that can be freed up is being calculated.
4. After the calculation is complete, the Disk Cleanup dialog box specifies 
the amount of space that can be freed up and the files to delete, some 
of which are checked automatically (Figure 6-30). Select those items 
from which you wish to delete files.

5. Click the OK button in the Disk Cleanup dialog box.
6. A dialog box asks if you are sure you want to perform these actions. Click the Delete Files button. The Disk Cleanup dialog
box illustrates the progress of the cleanup. When the cleanup is complete, the dialog box closes.
C. Defragment Disk
After removing all the unnecessary files from the hard disk, the next step in disk maintenance is to defragment all the files 
on the disk. When a file is stored on disk, the data in the file sometimes is stored contiguously, and other times is stored in a 
noncontiguous manner. The greater the amount of data on a disk, the more likely files will be stored noncontiguously. When a
file is stored in a noncontiguous manner, it can take significantly longer to find and retrieve data from the file. Therefore, one of
the more useful utilities to speed up disk operations is the defragmentation program, which combines all files so that no files are
stored in a noncontiguous manner. To use the defragmentation program, complete the following steps:
1. If necessary, click the Tools tab in the Properties dialog box for the hard disk to be defragmented.
2. Click the Defragment Now button in the Tools sheet to display the Disk Defragmenter dialog box (Figure 6-31). This window
displays the Disk Defragmenter schedule, when Disk Defragmenter was last run, and when Disk Defragmenter is next
scheduled to run.
3. Click the Defragment now button.
The defragmentation process begins.
During the defragmentation process,
the Cancel defragmentation button
replaces the Defragment now button.
The defragmentation process can
consume more than one hour in 
some cases, depending on the size 
of the hard disk and the amount of
processing that must occur. You can
cancel the operation at any time by
clicking the Cancel defragmentation
button in the Disk Defragmenter
window.
4. When the process is complete, the
Defragment now button will replace
the Cancel defragmentation button.
5. Click the Close button to close the
Disk Defragmenter dialog box.
Proper disk maintenance is critically important so that disk operation is as efficient as possible.

SYSTEM SOFTWARE
W
hen you purchase a personal computer, it usually has system software installed on its
hard disk. System software consists of the programs that control or maintain the opera-
tions of the computer and its devices. System software serves as the interface between
the user, the application software, and the computer’s hardware.
Two types of system software are operating systems and utility programs. This chapter discusses
the operating system and its functions, as well as several types of utility programs for personal
computers.

OPERATING SYSTEMS
An operating system (OS) is a set of programs containing instructions that work together to
coordinate all the activities among computer hardware resources. Most operating systems per-
form similar functions that include starting a computer, providing a user interface, managing
programs, managing memory, coordinating tasks, configuring devices, establishing an Internet
connection, monitoring performance, and providing file management utilities. Some operating
systems also allow users to control a network and administer security (Figure 7-1).
In most cases, the operating system is installed and resides on the computer’s hard disk. On
handheld computers and many mobile devices, however, the operating system may reside on a
ROM chip.
251
OPERATING SYSTEMS
C6672_CH07 pp4  1/30/08  2:18 PM  Page 251

Different sizes of computers typically use different operating systems. For example, a mainframe
computer does not use the same operating system as a personal computer. Even the same types of
computers, such as desktop computers, may not use the same operating system. Some, however,
can run multiple operating systems. When purchasing application software, you must ensure that
it works with the operating system installed on your computer.
The operating system that a computer uses sometimes is called the platform. On purchased
application software, the package identifies the required platform (operating system). A cross-
platform program is one that runs the same on multiple operating systems.
OPERATING SYSTEM FUNCTIONS
Many different operating systems exist; however, most operating systems provide similar 
functions. The following sections discuss functions common to most operating systems. The
operating system handles many of these functions automatically, without requiring any 
instruction from a user.
Starting a Computer
Booting is the process of starting or restarting a computer. When turning on a computer that has
been powered off completely, you are performing a cold boot. A warm boot, by contrast, is the
process of using the operating system to restart a computer. With Windows Vista, for example, you
can perform a warm boot by clicking a menu command (Figure 7-2). 
When you install new software or update existing software, often an on-screen prompt
instructs you to restart the computer. In this case, a warm boot is appropriate. 
Each time you boot a computer, the kernel and other frequently used operating system
instructions are loaded, or copied, from the hard disk (storage) into the computer’s memory
(RAM). The kernel is the core of an operating system that manages memory and devices, main-
tains the computer’s clock, starts pro-
grams, and assigns the computer’s
resources, such as devices, programs,
data, and information. The kernel is
memory resident, which means it
remains in memory while the computer
is running. Other parts of the operating
system are nonresident, that is, these
instructions remain on the hard disk
until they are needed.
When you boot a computer, a series 
of messages may be displayed on the
screen. The actual information displayed
varies depending on the make and type
of the computer and the equipment
installed. The boot process, however, is
similar for large and small computers.

CHAPTER 7
OPERATING SYSTEMS AND UTILITY PROGRAMS
How do I shut down a computer that uses Windows Vista?
The Start menu in Windows Vista provides many options from which to choose when you are finished using
your computer. By default, clicking the Power button on the Start menu will place your computer in sleep mode,
which is a low-power state that allows you quickly to resume your work when you return to your computer. You
are able to configure the default behavior of the Power button. If you click the arrow next to the Lock button,
you can select commands that allow you to switch users, log off, lock the computer, restart the computer, put
the computer to sleep, put the computer in hibernate mode (allows you to power off the computer, and then
resume from where you left off when you turn it on again), and shut down (power off) the computer. For more
information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch7/faq and then click Shut Down Options.

C6672_CH07 pp4  1/30/08  2:18 PM  Page 252

Providing a User Interface
You interact with software through its user interface. That is, a user interface controls how you
enter data and instructions and how information is displayed on the screen. Two types of user
interfaces are command-line and graphical. Operating systems sometimes use a combination of
these interfaces to define how a user interacts with a computer.
COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE
To configure devices, manage system resources, and troubleshoot 
network connections, network administrators and other advanced users work with a command-
line interface. In a command-line interface, a user types commands or presses special keys on the
keyboard to enter data and instructions (Figure 7-3a). Command-line interfaces often are difficult
to use because they require exact spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
Most users today work with a graphical user interface. With a
graphical user interface (GUI), you interact with menus and visual images such as buttons and
other graphical objects to issue commands (Figure 7-3b). Many current GUI operating systems
incorporate features similar to those of a Web browser. Windows Vista offers two different GUIs,
depending on your hardware configuration. Computers with less than 1 GB of RAM work with
the Windows Vista Basic interface. Computers with more than 1 GB of RAM work with the
Windows Vista Aero interface, known as Windows Aero, shown in Figure 7-3b, which provides
an enhanced visual look, additional navigation options, and animation.
253
OPERATING SYSTEM FUNCTIONS
Managing Programs
Some operating systems support a single user and only one running program at a time. Others
support thousands of users running multiple programs. How an operating system handles programs
directly affects your productivity.
A single user/single tasking operating system allows only one user to run one program at a
time. Smart phones and other personal mobile devices often use a single user/single tasking
operating system.
A single user/multitasking operating system allows a single user to work on two or more 
programs that reside in memory at the same time. Users today typically run multiple programs
concurrently. It is common to have an e-mail program and Web browser open at all times, while
working with application programs such as word processing or graphics.

When a computer is running multiple programs concurrently, one program is in the foreground
and the others are in the background. The one in the foreground is the active program, that is, 
the one you currently are using. The other programs running but not in use are in the background.
In Figure 7-4, the Microsoft PowerPoint program, which is showing a slide show, is in the fore-
ground, and three other programs are running in the background (Microsoft Excel, Windows
Media Player, and Chess Titans). 
The foreground program typically is displayed on the desktop but the background programs
often are hidden partially or completely behind the foreground program. You easily can switch
between foreground and background programs. To make a program active (in the foreground) in
Windows Vista, click its program button on the taskbar. This causes the operating system to place
all other programs in the background.

A multiuser operating system enables two or more users to run programs simultaneously.
Networks, servers, mainframes, and supercomputers allow hundreds to thousands of users to
connect at the same time, and thus are multiuser.
A multiprocessing operating system supports two or more processors running programs at the
same time. Multiprocessing involves the coordinated processing of programs by more than one
processor. Multiprocessing increases a computer’s processing speed.
A computer with separate processors also can serve as a fault-tolerant computer. A fault-tolerant
computer continues to operate when one of its components fails, ensuring that no data is lost.
Fault-tolerant computers have duplicate components such as processors, memory, and disk drives.
If any one of these components fails, the computer switches to the duplicate component and 
continues to operate. Airline reservation systems, communications networks, automated teller
machines, and other systems that must be operational at all times use fault-tolerant computers.
Managing Memory
The purpose of memory management is to optimize the use of random access memory (RAM).
RAM consists of one or more chips on the motherboard that hold items such as data and instruc-
tions while the processor interprets and executes them. The operating system allocates, or assigns,
data and instructions to an area of memory while they are being processed. Then, it carefully
monitors the contents of memory. Finally, the operating system releases these items from being
monitored in memory when the processor no longer requires them.
Virtual memory is a concept in which the operating system allocates a portion of a storage
medium, usually the hard disk, to function as additional RAM. As you interact with a program,
part of it may be in physical RAM, while the rest of the program is on the hard disk as virtual
memory. Because virtual memory is slower than RAM, users may notice the computer slowing
down while it uses virtual memory.
The operating system uses an area of the hard disk for virtual memory, in which it swaps
(exchanges) data, information, and instructions between memory and storage. The technique of
swapping items between memory and storage is called paging. When an operating system
spends much of its time paging, instead of executing application software, it is said to be thrash-
ing. If application software, such as a Web browser, has stopped responding and the hard disk’s
LED blinks repeatedly, the operating system probably is thrashing.
Instead of using a hard disk as virtual memory, Windows Vista users can increase size of memory
through Windows ReadyBoost, which can allocate up to 4 GB of removable flash memory devices
as additional memory cache. Users notice better performance with Windows ReadyBoost versus
hard disk virtual memory because the operating system accesses a flash memory device, such as a
USB flash drive or SD memory card, more quickly than it accesses a hard disk.
Coordinating Tasks
The operating system determines the order in which tasks are processed. A task, or job, is an
operation the processor manages. Tasks include receiving data from an input device, processing
instructions, sending information to an output device, and transferring items from storage to
memory and from memory to storage.
A multiuser operating system does not always process tasks on a first-come, first-served basis.
Sometimes, one user may have a higher priority than other users. In this case, the operating sys-
tem adjusts the schedule of tasks. 
Sometimes, a device already may be busy processing one task when it receives a second task.
This occurs because the processor operates at a much faster rate of speed than peripheral devices.
For example, if the processor sends five documents to a printer, the printer can print only one 
document at a time and store as many documents as its memory can handle.
While waiting for devices to become idle, the operating system places items in buffers. A buffer
is a segment of memory or storage in which items are placed while waiting to be transferred from
an input device or to an output device.
255
OPERATING SYSTEM FUNCTIONS
C6672_CH07 pp4  1/30/08  2:19 PM  Page 255

The operating system commonly uses buffers with printed documents. This process, called
spooling, sends documents to be printed to a buffer instead of sending them immediately to the
printer. The buffer holds the information waiting to print while the printer prints from the buffer
at its own rate of speed. By spooling documents to a buffer, the processor can continue interpreting
and executing instructions while the printer prints. This allows users to work on the computer for
other tasks while a printer is printing. Multiple print jobs line up in a queue (pronounced Q) in the
buffer. A program, called a print spooler, intercepts documents to be printed from the operating
system and places them in the queue (Figure 7-5).

Configuring Devices
A driver is a small program that tells the operating system how to communicate with a specific
device. Each device on a computer, such as the mouse, keyboard, monitor, printer, and scanner,
has its own specialized set of commands and thus requires its own specific driver. When you boot
a computer, the operating system loads each device’s driver. 
If you attach a new device to a computer, such as a printer or scanner, its driver must be
installed before you can use the device. For many devices, the computer’s operating system
includes the necessary drivers. If it does not, you can install the drivers from the CD provided
with the purchased device.
Today, many devices and operating systems support Plug and Play. Plug and Play means the
operating system automatically configures new devices as you install them. With Plug and Play, 
a user can plug in a device, turn on the computer, and then use the device without having to 
configure the system manually.
Establishing an Internet Connection
Operating systems typically provide a means to establish Internet connections. For example,
Windows Vista includes a ‘Connect to a network’ wizard that guides users through the process of
setting up a connection between a computer and an Internet access provider (Figure 7-6).
Some operating systems also include a Web browser and an e-mail program, enabling you to
begin using the Web and communicate with others as soon as you set up the Internet connection.
Some also include utilities to protect computers from unauthorized intrusions and unwanted 
software such as viruses and spyware.
FIGURE 7-5
Spooling increases both processor and printer efficiency by placing documents to be printed in a buffer on disk
before they are printed. This figure illustrates three documents in the queue with one document printing.

Monitoring Performance
Operating systems typically contain a performance monitor. A performance monitor is a program
that assesses and reports information about various computer resources and devices.
The information in performance reports helps users and administrators identify a problem with
resources so that they can try to resolve any problems. If a computer is running extremely slow, for
example, the performance monitor may determine that the computer’s memory is being used to its
maximum. Thus, you might consider installing additional memory in the computer.
Providing File Management and Other Utilities
Operating systems often provide users with the capability of managing files, searching for files,
viewing images, securing a computer from unauthorized access, uninstalling programs, scanning
disks, defragmenting disks, diagnosing problems, backing up files and disks, and setting up screen
savers. A later section in the chapter discusses these utilities in depth. 
Controlling a Network
Some operating systems are network operating systems. A network operating system, or network
OS, is an operating system that organizes and coordinates how multiple users access and share
resources on a network. Resources include hardware, software, data, and information. For example, a
network OS allows multiple users to share a printer, Internet access, files, and programs. 
Some operating systems have network features built into them. In other cases, the network OS is a
set of programs separate from the operating system on the client computers that access the network.
When not connected to the network, the client computers use their own operating system. When 
connected to the network, the network OS may assume some of the operating system functions.
The network administrator, the person overseeing network operations,
uses the network OS to add and remove users, computers, and other devices
to and from the network. The network administrator also uses the network
operating system to install software and administer network security.
Administering Security
The network administrator uses the network OS to establish 
permissions to resources. These permissions define who can access 
certain resources and when they can access those resources. 
For each user, the network administrator establishes a user account,
which enables a user to access, or log on to, a computer or a network.
Each user account typically consists of a user name and password
(Figure 7-7). A user name, or user ID, is a unique combination of charac-
ters, such as letters of the alphabet or numbers, that identifies one spe-
cific user. Many users select a combination of their first and last names
as their user name. A user named Henry Baker might choose H Baker
as his user name.

FIGURE 7-7
Most multiuser operating systems allow
each user to log on, which is the process of entering a
user name and a password into the computer. 
C6672_CH07 pp4  1/30/08  2:19 PM  Page 257

A password is a private combination of characters associated with the user name that allows access
to certain computer resources. Some operating systems allow the network administrator to assign
passwords to files and commands, restricting access to only authorized users. 
To prevent unauthorized users from accessing computer resources, keep your password confidential.
While entering your password, most computers hide the actual password characters by displaying
some other characters, such as asterisks (*) or dots. After entering a user name and password, the 
operating system compares the user’s entry with a list of authorized user names and passwords. If 
the entry matches the user name and password kept on file, the operating system grants the user
access. If the entry does not match, the operating system denies access to the user. 
The operating system records successful and unsuccessful logon attempts in a file. This allows 
the network administrator to review who is using or attempting to use the computer. Network
administrators also use these files to monitor computer usage.
To protect sensitive data and information as it travels over the network, a network operating system
may encrypt it. Encryption is the process of encoding data and information into an unreadable form.
Network administrators can set up a network to encrypt data as it travels over the network to prevent
unauthorized users from reading the data. When an authorized user attempts to read the data, it auto-
matically is decrypted, or converted back into a readable form. Read Ethics & Issues 7-1 for a related
discussion.

What are the guidelines for selecting a good password?
Choose a password that is easy to remember, and that no one could guess. Do not use any part of your first or last name, your spouse’s or
child’s name, telephone number, street address, license plate number, Social Security number, birthday, and so on. Be sure your password is
at least eight characters long, mixed with uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. You also should avoid using
single-word passwords that are found in the dictionary. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch7/faq and then click Passwords.
Who Should Be Responsible for Notebook Computer Security?
As notebook computers now outsell desktop computers, they increasingly have become the focus of security breaches. A notebook computer’s
greatest asset, portability, also may be its greatest weakness. Recently, the theft of a notebook computer from an employee’s home resulted in
information regarding more than 25 million veterans falling into the wrong hands. The information included Social Security numbers, and the
resulting fallout cost the organization millions of dollars. Security experts claim that organizations have become lax about allowing employees 
to store sensitive information on notebook computers. Too often, they argue, organizations allow employees to take computers home on a 
daily basis when no such need exists. Employers, on the other hand, feel that workers are more productive when allowed to work during the
evenings and weekends using notebook computers. One possible solution is the use of full-disk encryption, which scrambles all of the note-
book computer’s data on its hard disk and requires a password to unlock. If the computer is stolen, the thief cannot access the data on the hard
disk. Those who opposed the widespread use of full-disk encryption say that its use results in slower system performance, is still vulnerable
when users are lax with securing their passwords, and may result in lost data when an employee leaves the organization without disclosing the
password. Who should be responsible for notebook computer security? Why? Should employees be allowed to take their notebook computers
home every night or should the computers be taken offsite only for legitimate, preapproved business purposes? Why or why not? Should more 
organizations use full-disk encryption? Why or why not?

OPERATING SYSTEM UTILITY PROGRAMS
A utility program, also called a utility, is a type 
of system software that allows a user to perform
maintenance-type tasks, usually related to manag-
ing a computer, its devices, or its programs. Most
operating systems include several built-in utility
programs (Figure 7-8). Users often buy stand-alone
utilities, however, because they offer improvements
over those included with the operating system.
Utility programs included with most operating
systems provide the following functions: managing
files, searching for files, viewing images, securing a
computer from unauthorized access, uninstalling
programs, scanning disks, defragmenting disks,
diagnosing problems, backing up files and disks,
and setting up screen savers. The following sections
briefly discuss each of these utilities.
File Manager
A file manager is a utility that performs functions
related to file management. Some of the file man-
agement functions that a file manager performs 
are displaying a list of files on a storage medium
(Figure 7-9); organizing files in folders; and copy-
ing, renaming, deleting, moving, and sorting files.
A folder is a specific named location on a storage
medium that contains related documents.
Search Utility
A search utility is a program that attempts to
locate a file on your computer based on criteria
you specify. The criteria could be a word or words
contained in a file, date the file was created or
modified, size of the file, location of the file, file
name, author/artist, and other similar properties.
Search utilities can look through documents, pic-
tures, music, and other files. Windows Vista has a
built-in search utility. All the Explorer windows,
as well as the Start menu, contain a Search box
where you enter the search criteria. 
Image Viewer
An image viewer is a utility that allows users 
to display, copy, and print the contents of a graph-
ics file. With an image viewer, users can see
images without having to open them in a paint or
image editing program. Windows Vista includes
an image viewer called Windows Photo Gallery
(Figure 7-10). To display a file in this image
viewer, simply double-click the thumbnail of the
image in the file manager, such as the thumbnail
shown in Figure 7-9.

FIGURE 7-11
Through the Security Center in the Control Panel of Windows Vista, users can configure
Windows Firewall, which is a personal firewall utility included with Windows Vista.
Personal Firewall
A personal firewall is a utility that detects and protects a personal computer from unauthorized
intrusions. Personal firewalls constantly monitor all transmissions to and from a computer.
When connected to the Internet, your computer is vulnerable to attacks from a hacker. A hacker
is someone who tries to access a computer or network illegally. Users with broadband Internet
connections, such as through DSL and Internet cable television service, are even more susceptible
than those with dial-up access because the Internet connection always is on.
Windows Vista automatically enables its built-in personal firewall upon installation. This firewall,
called Windows Firewall, is easy to access and configure (Figure 7-11). If your operating system
does not include a personal firewall or you want additional protection, you can purchase a stand-
alone personal firewall utility or a hardware firewall, which is a device such as a router that has a
built-in firewall.

CHAPTER 7
OPERATING SYSTEMS AND UTILITY PROGRAMS
Uninstaller
An uninstaller is a utility that removes a program, as well as any associated entries in the 
system files. When you install a program, the operating system records the information it uses to
run the software in the system files. The uninstaller deletes files and folders from the hard disk, 
as well as removes program entries from the system files. 
Disk Scanner
A disk scanner is a utility that searches for and removes unnecessary files. Windows Vista
includes a disk scanner utility called Disk Cleanup.

Disk Defragmenter
A disk defragmenter is a utility that reorganizes the
files and unused space on a computer’s hard disk so that
the operating system accesses data more quickly and pro-
grams run faster. When an operating system stores data 
on a disk, it places the data in the first available sector 
on the disk. It attempts to place data in sectors that are
contiguous (next to each other), but this is not always 
possible. When the contents of a file are scattered across
two or more noncontiguous sectors, the file is fragmented. 
Fragmentation slows down disk access and thus the 
performance of the entire computer. Defragmenting the
disk, or reorganizing it so that the files are stored in con-
tiguous sectors, solves this problem (Figure 7-12). Windows
Vista includes a disk defragmenter available on the System
Tools list.
Diagnostic Utility
A diagnostic utility compiles technical information about your computer’s hardware and certain
system software programs and then prepares a report outlining any identified problems. Information

Backup Utility
A backup utility allows users to copy, or back up, selected files or an entire hard disk to another
storage medium such as CD, DVD, external hard disk, USB flash drive, or tape. During the backup
process, the backup utility monitors progress and alerts you if it needs additional media, such as
another CD. Many backup programs compress, or shrink the size of, files during the backup process.
By compressing the files, the backup program requires less storage space for the backup files than for
the original files.
Because they are compressed, you usually cannot use backup files in their backed up form. In the
event you need to use a backup file, a restore program reverses the process and returns backed up
files to their original form. Backup utilities include restore programs.
You should back up files and disks regularly in the event your originals are lost, damaged, or
destroyed. Instead of backing up to a local disk storage device, some users opt to use online storage to
back up their files. Online storage is a service on the Web that provides hard disk storage to computer
users, usually for free or for a minimal monthly fee.
Screen Saver
A screen saver is a utility that causes a display device’s screen to
show a moving image or blank screen if no keyboard or mouse activ-
ity occurs for a specified time (Figure 7-13). When you press a key on
the keyboard or move the mouse, the screen saver disappears and the
screen returns to the previous state.
Screen savers originally were developed to prevent a problem
called ghosting, in which images could be etched permanently on a
monitor’s screen. Although ghosting is not as severe of a problem
with today’s displays, manufacturers continue to recommend that
users install screen savers for this reason. Screen savers also are pop-
ular for security, business, and entertainment purposes. To secure a
computer, users configure their screen saver to require a password 
to deactivate. Many of the Windows Vista screen savers require
Windows Aero. In addition to those included with the operating
system, many screen savers are available for a minimal fee in stores
and on the Web.

TYPES OF OPERATING SYSTEMS
When you purchase a new computer,
it typically has an operating system
preinstalled. As new versions of the
operating system are released, users
upgrade their existing computers to
incorporate features of the new ver-
sion. Purchasing an operating system
upgrade usually costs less than pur-
chasing the entire operating system.
New versions of an operating sys-
tem usually are downward compati-
ble. That is, they recognize and work
with application software written for
an earlier version of the operating
system (or platform). By contrast,
the application software is said to be
upward compatible, meaning it will
run on new versions of the operating
system. 
The three basic categories of 
operating systems that exist today
are stand-alone, network, and
embedded. The table in Figure 7-14
lists names of operating systems in
each category. The following pages
discuss the operating systems listed
in the table.
STAND-ALONE OPERATING SYSTEMS
A stand-alone operating system is a complete operating system that works on a desktop 
computer, notebook computer, or mobile computing device. Some stand-alone operating
systems are called client operating systems because they also work in conjunction with a net-
work operating system. Client operating systems can operate with or without a network. Other
stand-alone operating systems include networking capabilities, allowing the home and small
business user to set up a small network. Examples of currently used stand-alone operating 
systems are Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS X, UNIX, and Linux.

What was Microsoft’s first operating system?
In the early 1980s, Microsoft introduced DOS (Disk Operating System) as its first operating system. The two more widely used versions of
DOS were PC-DOS and MS-DOS. At first, DOS used a command-line interface, but later versions introduced a menu-driven interface. DOS
once was used on an estimated 70 million computers, but rarely is used today because it lacks a graphical user interface and does not
take full advantage of modern personal computer processors. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch7/faq and then click DOS.
FIGURE 7-14
Examples of stand-alone, network, and
embedded operating systems. Some stand-alone operating
systems include the capability of configuring small home or

Windows XP
In the mid-1980s, Microsoft developed its first version of Windows, which provided a graphical
user interface (GUI). Since then, Microsoft continually has updated its Windows operating system,
incorporating innovative features and functions with each new version. Windows XP is a fast,
reliable Windows operating system, providing quicker startup, better performance, increased

security, and a simpler visual look than
previous Windows versions (Figure 7-15).
Windows XP is available in five editions:
Home Edition, Professional Edition,
Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition,
and Professional x64 Edition. 
Windows Vista
Windows Vista, the successor to
Windows XP, is Microsoft’s fastest, most
reliable and efficient operating system to
date, offering quicker program start up,
built-in diagnostics, automatic recovery,
improved security, and enhanced searching
and organizing capabilities (Figure 7-16).
Windows Vista is available in five 
editions: Windows Vista Home Basic,
Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows
Vista Ultimate, Windows Vista Business,
and Windows Vista Enterprise. Windows
Vista Home Basic, designed for the basic
home user, uses the Windows Vista Basic
interface and allows users easily to search
for files, protect their computer from unauthorized intruders and unwanted programs, and set
parental controls to monitor the use of games, the Internet, instant messaging, and other communica-
tions programs. Windows Vista Home Premium includes all the capabilities of Windows Vista Home
Basic and also includes Windows Aero with its Flip 3D feature and provides tools to create DVDs
and edit movies, record and watch television shows, connect to a game console, securely connect to
Wi-Fi networks, work with a Tablet PC, and quickly view messages on a powered-off, specially
equipped notebook computer. Windows Vista Ultimate includes all features of Windows Vista Home
Premium and provides additional features
designed to make mobile users’ comput-
ers more secure and easier to network.
With Windows Vista Business, users in 
all sizes of businesses are provided a
secure operating environment that uses
Windows Aero where they easily can
search for files, protect their computers
from unauthorized intruders and
unwanted programs, use improved
backup technologies, securely connect to
Wi-Fi networks, quickly view messages
on a powered-off, specially equipped
notebook computer, and easily share doc-
uments and collaborate with other users.
Windows Vista Enterprise includes all the
features of Windows Vista Business and
also offers greater levels of data protection
and a multi-language interface.
Windows Vista adapts to the hardware
configuration on which it is installed.
Thus, two users with the same edition of
Windows Vista may experience different
functionality and interfaces.

Mac OS X
Since it was released with Macintosh computers in 1984, Apple’s Macintosh operating system
has set the standard for operating system ease of use and has been the model for most of the new
GUIs developed for non-Macintosh systems. The latest version, Mac OS X, is a multitasking
operating system available only for computers manufactured by Apple (Figure 7-17).

UNIX
UNIX (pronounced YOU-nix) is a multitasking operating system. Several versions of this
operating system exist, each slightly different. Although some versions of UNIX have a 
command-line interface, most versions of UNIX offer a graphical user interface (Figure 7-18).
Today, a version of UNIX is available for most computers of all sizes. Power users often work
with UNIX because of its flexibility and power.

Linux
Linux is one of the faster growing operating systems. Linux (pronounced LINN-uks) is a popu-
lar, multitasking UNIX-type operating system. In addition to the basic operating system, Linux also
includes many free programming languages and utility programs. Linux is not proprietary soft-
ware like the operating systems discussed thus far. Instead, Linux is open source software, which
means its code is available to the public for use, modification, and redistribution. Read Ethics &
Issues 7-2 for a related discussion, and read Looking Ahead 7-1 for a look at a future use of open
source software.
Linux is available in a variety of forms,
or distributions. Some distributions of
Linux are command-line. Others are GUI
(Figure 7-19). Users obtain Linux in a
variety of ways. Some people download 
it free from the Web. Others purchase it
from vendors, who bundle their own soft-
ware with the operating system. Linux
CDs are included in many Linux books
and also are available for purchase from
vendors. For purchasers of new personal
computers, some retailers such as Dell
will preinstall Linux on the hard disk on
request. Another option is Live CD or
Live USB, where the CD or USB flash
drive is bootable. In this case, the CD or
USB drive contains files necessary to boot
and work with the Linux operating sys-
tem, which allows users to preview the
operating system without installing it.
265
STAND-ALONE OPERATING SYSTEMS
Closed Source vs. Open Source 
Operating Systems
Linux is a fast-growing, innovative operating system. One of the
features that make it different from other operating systems is that
Linux is open source and its source code, along with any changes,
remains public. Since its introduction in 1991, Linux has been altered,
adapted, and improved by thousands of programmers. Unlike Linux,
most operating systems are proprietary, and their program code often
is a zealously guarded secret. At one large software developer, an
employee reported that application programmers had little opportunity
to contribute to operating system programs because they had no
access to the operating system program source code. Supporters of
open source maintain that source code should be open to the public so
that it can be scrutinized, corrected, and enhanced. In light of concerns
about security and fears of possible virus problems, however, some
people are not sure open source software is a good idea. Besides, they
argue, companies and programmers should be able to control, and
profit from, the operating systems they create. On the other hand, open
source software can be scrutinized for errors by a much larger group
of people and changes can be made immediately. Are open source
operating systems a good idea? Why or why not? How can the con-
cerns about open source software be addressed? What are the advan-
tages and disadvantages of open versus closed source operating
systems? Does the open source model lead to better software?

Open Source Projects Promote Digital
Identity Sharing
A typical Internet user may need
dozens of passwords to conduct
business and view particular Web
pages. This need for a unique iden-
tity at each Web site may be elimi-
nated with several new projects
Microsoft is funding.
Under the company’s Identity Selector Interoperability
Profile (ISIP), Web users will log on once, verify their iden-
tity, and then access multiple Web sites without needing to
log on at each one. ISIP should be useful in online transac-
tions and other circumstances where user information is
shared over a network.
Microsoft will allow programmers to access the 
open-source code the company has developed for its ISIP
technology. Programmers will not need a license or fear
patent infringement lawsuits under Microsoft’s Open
Specification Promise (OSP) project. OSP’s goal is to
encourage a wide range of developers to use Microsoft’s
open source software in a simple, clear manner. For more

NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEMS
As discussed earlier in this chapter, a network operating system is an operating system that is designed
specifically to support a network. A network operating system typically resides on a server. The client
computers on the network rely on the server(s) for resources. Many of the client operating systems 
discussed in the previous section work in conjunction with a network operating system. 
Some of the stand-alone operating systems discussed in the previous section include networking
capability; however, network operating systems are designed specifically to support all sizes of 
networks, including medium- to large-sized businesses and Web servers.
Examples of network operating systems include Windows Server 2008. 
• Windows Server 2008 is an upgrade to Windows Server 2003.
• UNIX and Linux often are called multipurpose operating systems because they are both stand-alone
and network operating systems.
• Solaris, a version of UNIX developed by Sun Microsystems, is a network operating system
designed specifically for e-commerce applications.
• Novell’s Netware is a network operating system designed for client/server networks.
EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEMS
The operating system on most smart phones and small devices, called an embedded operating
system, resides on a ROM chip. Popular embedded operating systems include Windows Embedded
CE, Windows Mobile, Palm OS, BlackBerry (Figure 7-20), embedded Linux, and Symbian OS. 
• Windows Embedded CE is a scaled-down Windows operating system designed for use on
communications, entertainment, and computing devices with limited functionality. Examples 
of devices that use Windows Embedded CE include VoIP telephones, point-of-sale terminals,
digital cameras, navigation systems, portable media players, ticket machines, and computerized
sewing machines.
• Windows Mobile, an operating system based on Windows Embedded CE, works on specific types
of devices. Window Mobile-based devices include smart phones and PDAs, called the Pocket PC.
With the Windows Mobile operating system and a compatible device, users have access to the
basic PIM (personal information manager) functions such as contact lists, schedules, tasks,
calendars, and notes.
• Palm OS, which is a competing operating system to Windows Mobile, runs on smart phones 
and PDAs. With Palm OS and a compatible device, users manage schedules and contacts, phone
messages, project notes, reminders, tasks and address lists, and important dates and appointments.

• The BlackBerry operating system runs on handheld devices supplied
by RIM (Research In Motion). BlackBerry devices provide PIM,
phone, and wireless capabilities. Some also allow you to take
pictures, play music, and access maps and directions.
• Embedded Linux is a scaled-down Linux operating system designed
for smart phones, PDAs, smart watches, set-top boxes, Internet
telephones, and many other types of devices and computers requiring
an embedded operating system. Devices with embedded Linux offer
calendar and address book and other PIM functions, touch screens,
and handwriting recognition.
• Symbian OS is an open source multitasking operating system
designed for smart phones. Users enter data by pressing keys on the
keypad or keyboard, touching the screen, and writing on the screen
with a stylus.
STAND-ALONE UTILITY PROGRAMS
Although operating systems typically include some built-in utilities, many stand-alone utility programs
are available for purchase. For example, you can purchase personal firewalls, backup utilities, and
screen savers. These stand-alone utilities typically offer improvements over those features built into the
operating system or provide features not included in an operating system. 
Other functions provided by stand-alone utilities include protecting against viruses, removing
spyware and adware, filtering Internet content, compressing files, converting files, playing media
files, burning CDs and DVDs, and maintaining a personal computer. The following sections discuss
each of these utilities.
Antivirus Programs
The term, computer virus, describes a potentially damaging computer program that affects, or
infects, a computer negatively by altering the way the computer works without the user’s knowledge
or permission. More specifically, a computer virus is a segment of program code from some outside
source that implants itself in a computer. Once the virus is in a computer, it can spread throughout
and may damage your files and operating system. 
Computer viruses do not generate by chance. The programmer of a virus, known as a virus
author, intentionally writes a virus program. Some virus authors find writing viruses a challenge.
Others write them to cause destruction. Writing a virus program usually requires significant
programming skills.
Some viruses are harmless pranks that simply freeze a computer temporarily or display sounds or
messages. The Music Bug virus, for example, instructs the computer to play a few chords of music.
Other viruses destroy or corrupt data stored on the hard
disk of the infected computer. If you notice any unusual
changes in your computer’s performance, it may be
infected with a virus. Figure 7-21 outlines some com-
mon symptoms of virus infection.
A worm copies itself repeatedly, for example, in
memory or over a network, using up system resources
and possibly shutting the system down. A Trojan horse
hides within or looks like a legitimate program such 
as a screen saver. A certain condition or action usually
triggers the Trojan horse. Unlike a virus or worm, a
Trojan horse does not replicate itself to other comput-
ers. Currently, more than 180,000 known viruses,
worms, Trojan horses, and similar threats exist.

To protect a computer from virus attacks, users should install an antivirus program and
update it frequently. An antivirus program protects a computer against viruses by identifying
and removing any computer
viruses found in memory, on stor-
age media, or on incoming files
(Figure 7-22). Most antivirus pro-
grams also protect against worms
and Trojan horses. When you
purchase a new computer, it often
includes antivirus software. 
Three more popular antivirus 
programs are McAfee VirusScan,
Norton AntiVirus, and Windows
Live OneCare, the latter of which
also contains spyware removers,
Internet filters, PC maintenance, 
and backup utilities. As an alter-
native to purchasing these prod-
ucts on CD, both McAfee and
Norton offer Web-based
antivirus programs.
Spyware and Adware Removers
Spyware is a program placed on a computer without the user’s knowledge that secretly 
collects information about the user, often related to Web browsing habits. The spyware program
communicates information it collects to some outside source while you are online. Adware is a
program that displays an online advertisement in a banner or pop-up window on Web pages, 
e-mail, or other Internet services. Sometimes, spyware is hidden in adware. A spyware remover
is a program that detects and deletes spyware, and similar programs. An adware remover is a
program that detects and deletes adware. Most spyware and adware removers cost less than
$50; some are available on the Web at no cost. Some operating systems include spyware and
adware removers.
Internet Filters
Filters are programs that remove or block certain
items from being displayed. Four widely used
Internet filters are anti-spam programs, Web filters,
phishing filters, and pop-up blockers.
ANTI-SPAM PROGRAMS
Spam is an unsolicited 
e-mail message or newsgroup posting sent to many
recipients or newsgroups at once. Spam is Internet
junk mail. An anti-spam program is a filtering
program that attempts to remove spam before it
reaches your inbox. Internet access providers often
filter spam as a service for their subscribers.
WEB FILTERS
Web filtering software is a program
that restricts access to certain material on the Web.
Some restrict access to specific Web sites; others fil-
ter sites that use certain words or phrases. Many
businesses use Web filtering software to limit
employee’s Web access. Some schools, libraries, and
parents use this software to restrict access to minors.
268
CHAPTER 7
OPERATING SYSTEMS AND UTILITY PROGRAMS
Should anti-spam programs 
be installed on home computers?
Yes. Reports indicate that spam originated as early
as 1978, when an e-mail was sent to several
ARPANET addresses. The majority of all e-mail traf-
fic now consists of spam, with the volume increas-
ing daily. Fortunately, anti-spam programs installed
on your computer, combined with your Internet
access provider’s anti-spam measures, greatly
reduce the amount of spam you receive.The chart

STAND-ALONE UTILITY PROGRAMS
PHISHING FILTERS
Phishing is a scam in which a perpetrator attempts to obtain your personal
and/or financial information. A phishing filter is a program that warns or blocks you from 
potentially fraudulent or suspicious Web sites. Some Web browsers include phishing filters.
POP-UP BLOCKERS
A pop-up ad is an Internet advertisement that suddenly appears in a new
window in the foreground of a Web page displayed in your browser. A pop-up blocker is a filtering
program that stops pop-up ads from displaying on Web pages. Many Web browsers include a 
pop-up blocker. You also can download pop-up blockers from the Web at no cost. 
File Compression
A file compression utility shrinks the size of a file(s). A compressed file takes up less storage space
than the original file. Compressing files frees up room on the storage media and improves system per-
formance. Attaching a compressed file to an e-mail message, for example, reduces the time needed for
file transmission. Uploading and downloading compressed files to and from the Internet reduces the
file transmission time.
Compressed files sometimes are called zipped files. When you receive or download a compressed file,
you must uncompress it. To uncompress, or unzip, a file, you restore it to its original form. Some operating
systems such as Windows Vista include file compression and uncompression capabilities. To compress a
file, however, you need a stand-alone file compression utility. Two popular stand-alone file compression
utilities are PKZIP and WinZip.
File Conversion
A file conversion utility transforms the contents of a file
or data from one format to another. When a business devel-
ops a new system, often the data in the current system is not
in the correct format for the new system. Thus, part of the
system development process is to convert data — instead of
having users re-enter all the existing data in the new system.
On a smaller scale, when home users purchase new soft-
ware, they may need to convert files so that the files will be
displayed properly in the new software.
Media Player
A media player is a program that allows you to view images
and animation, listen to audio, and watch video files on your
computer (Figure 7-23). Media players may also include the
capability to organize media files, convert them to different for-
mats, connect to and purchase media from an online media
store, download podcasts and vodcasts, burn audio CDs, and
transfer media to portable media players. Windows Vista
includes Windows Media Player. Three other popular media
players are iTunes, RealPlayer, and Rhapsody.
CD/DVD Burning
CD/DVD burning software writes text, graphics, audio, and
video files on a recordable or rewritable CD or DVD, including
Blu-ray and HD DVD. This software enables the home user eas-
ily to back up contents of their hard disk on a CD/DVD and
make duplicates of uncopyrighted music or movies. CD/DVD
burning software usually also includes photo editing, audio
editing, and video editing capabilities (Figure 7-24).
When you buy a recordable or rewritable CD or DVD, it
typically includes CD/DVD burning software. You also can
buy CD/DVD burning software for a cost of less than $100.

Systems Programmer
System software is a key component in any computer. A systems programmer evaluates, installs, and 
maintains system software and provides technical support to the programming staff.
Systems programmers work with the programs that control computers, such as operating systems, 
network operating systems, and database systems. They identify current and future processing needs and 
then recommend the software and hardware necessary to meet those needs. In addition to selecting and 
installing system software, systems programmers must be able to adapt system software to the requirements 
of an organization, provide regular maintenance, measure system performance, determine the impact of new or updated software on the
system, design and implement special software, and provide documentation. Because they are familiar with the entire system, systems
programmers often help application programmers to diagnose technical problems.
Systems programmers must be acquainted thoroughly with a variety of operating systems. They must be able to think logically, pay
attention to detail, work with abstract concepts, and devise solutions to complex problems. Systems programmers often work in teams
and interact with programmers and nontechnical users, so communications skills are important.
Most systems programmers have a four-year B.S. degree in Computer Science or Information Technology. Depending on responsibilities
and experience, salaries range from $65,000 to as much as $120,000. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch7/careers and then
click Systems Programmer.
Personal Computer Maintenance
Operating systems typically include a 
diagnostic utility that diagnoses computer
problems but does not repair them. A
personal computer maintenance utility identi-
fies and fixes operating system problems,
detects and repairs disk problems, and includes
the capability of improving a computer’s per-
formance. Additionally, some personal com-
puter maintenance utilities continuously
monitor a computer while you use it to identify
and repair problems before they occur. Norton
SystemWorks is a popular personal computer
maintenance utility designed for Windows
operating systems (Figure 7-25).

Red Hat
Open Source Software Distributor
When you were young, you were taught to share. University professors share their research
with colleagues throughout the world; and Red Hat shares software code, or instructions, with
computer users.
Red Hat is the world’s largest supplier of open source software, which allows buyers 
to view, modify, and perhaps improve, the software. The company delivers the software
improvements to customers through the Red Hat Network, the company’s Internet service.
Bob Young and Marc Ewing founded Red Hat in 1994 and started distributing a version of the
Red Hat Linux operating system complete with documentation and support. Today, Linux is Red
Hat’s most well-known product. Subscriptions to the company’s premium Linux software have
helped boost the company to profitability. The company launched the Red Hat Exchange in 2007
to offer a Web site where customers can buy a range of open-source software from the com-
pany’s business partners. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch7/companies and then
click Red Hat.
Research In Motion (RIM)
Wireless Mobile Communication Devices Manufacturer
In today’s mobile world, people often need to access their e-mail wirelessly. Chances are they
find Research In Motion (RIM)’s products valuable. More than 4 million people are using RIM’s
popular BlackBerry models, which combine e-mail, phone, Internet browsing, and organizer
features. The built-in keyboards allow users to send and receive text messages.
Mike Lazaridis, the current co-CEO, founded RIM in 1984 in Waterloo, Ontario. His passion
for wireless technology emerged in high school as a member of the local amateur radio and
television club. He developed RIM’s first major product, the Inter@ctive Pager, in 1996. Two
years later, the same hardware was used in the first BlackBerry; this product’s success was
due to its capability to combine a wireless mailbox with a corporate mailbox so that users
could access e-mail continuously.
In 2007, RIM was the only wireless technology company named one of Canada’s Top 100
Employers for its exceptional work atmosphere, performance management, and community
involvement. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch7/companies and then click RIM.

Alan Kay
Computer Pioneer
Chances are that every time you use your computer you use one of Alan Kay’s ideas. More than 35 years ago — long before
the personal computer became ubiquitous — he was developing a notebook computer complete with a flat screen, wireless
network, and storage. More than 20 years ago, he engineered a graphical user interface, object-oriented languages, and 
personal computer networks.
Kay did much of his early work at the U.S. Defense Department’s Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) and Xerox’s
Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Today he is a computer science professor at UCLA and president of the Viewpoints
Research Institute, a nonprofit organization involved in the One Laptop per Child project and in developing a new user 
interface that helps users learn. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch7/people and then click Alan Kay.
Linus Torvalds
Linux Creator
When Linus Torvalds developed a new operating system in 1991, he announced his project in an Internet newsgroup, made the
source code available, and asked for suggestions. Computer users responded by reviewing the system and offering enhance-
ments. Three years later, Torvalds released a much-enhanced version of an open source operating system he called Linux.
Torvalds developed the innovative operating system when he was a 21-year-old computer science student in Finland.
Today, Linux is estimated to be running on at least 10 percent of computers and is Microsoft’s main competitor. Torvalds
leads the development of Linux as a fellow at OSDL (Open Source Development Labs), a not-for-profit consortium of com-
panies dedicated to developing and promoting the operating system. Torvalds says his day-to-day involvement with Linux
involves merging the lines of code so that the software runs smoothly. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch7/

Chapter Review
The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students regarding
any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch7/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
What Are the Types of System Software?
System software consists of the programs that control or maintain the operations of a computer and its devices. Two
types of system software are operating systems and utility programs. An operating system (OS) contains instructions 
that work together to coordinate all the activities among computer hardware resources. A utility program performs 
maintenance-type tasks, usually related to managing a computer, its devices, or its programs.
What Are the Functions of an Operating System?
The operating system provides a user interface, manages programs, manages memory, coordinates tasks, configures
devices, establishes an Internet connection, and monitors performance. The user interface controls how data and instruc-
tions are entered and how information is displayed. Two types of user interfaces are a command-line interface and a
graphical user interface (GUI). Managing programs refers to how many users, and how many programs, an operating
system can support at one time. An operating system can be single user/single tasking, single user/multitasking, multi-
user, or multiprocessing. Memory management optimizes the use of random access memory (RAM). Virtual memory
allocates a portion of a storage medium to function as additional RAM. Coordinating tasks determines the order in which
tasks are processed. Configuring devices involves loading each device’s driver when a user boots the computer. A driver
is a program that tells the operating system how to communicate with a specific device. Establishing an Internet connec-
tion sets up a connection between a computer and an Internet access provider. A performance monitor is a program that
assesses and reports information about computer resources and devices.
What Is the Purpose of the Utilities Included with Most Operating Systems?
Most operating systems include several built-in utility programs. A file manager performs functions related to file 
management. A search utility attempts to locate a file on your computer based on criteria you specify. An image viewer
displays, copies, and prints the contents of a graphics file. A personal firewall detects and protects a personal computer
from unauthorized intrusions. An uninstaller removes a program and any associated entries in the system files. A disk
scanner searches for and removes unnecessary files. A disk defragmenter reorganizes the files and unused space on a
computer’s hard disk. A diagnostic utility compiles and reports technical information about a computer’s hardware and
certain system software programs. A backup utility is used to copy, or back up, selected files or an entire hard disk to
another storage medium. A screen saver displays a moving image or blank screen if no keyboard or mouse activity occurs
for a specified time.
What Are Features of Several Stand-Alone Operating Systems?
A stand-alone operating system is a complete operating system that works on a desktop computer, notebook computer, or
mobile computing device. Stand-alone operating systems include Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS X, UNIX, and Linux.
Windows XP is a fast, reliable Windows operating system, providing better performance, increased security, and a simpler
look than previous Windows versions. Windows Vista, successor to Windows XP, is Microsoft’s fastest, most reliable and
efficient operating system to date, offering quicker program start up, built-in diagnostics, automatic recovery, improved secu-
rity, and enhanced searching and organizing capabilities. Mac OS X is a multitasking GUI operating system available only
for Apple computers. UNIX is a multitasking operating system that is flexible and powerful. Linux is a popular, multi-
tasking UNIX-type operating system that is open source software, which means its code is available to the public for use,
modification, and redistribution.

What Devices Use Embedded Operating Systems?
Most smart phones and small devices have an embedded operating system that resides on a ROM chip. Popular embedded
operating systems include Windows Embedded CE, Windows Mobile, Palm OS, BlackBerry, embedded Linux, and Symbian
OS. Windows Embedded CE is a scaled-down Windows operating system designed for use on communications, entertain-
ment, and computing devices with limited functionality. Windows Mobile, an operating system based on Windows Embedded
CE, works on specific types of devices, such as smart phones and PDAs, called a Pocket PC. Palm OS is an operating system
used on smart phones and PDAs. The BlackBerry operating system runs on handheld devices supplied by RIM. Embedded
Linux is a scaled-down Linux operating system for smart phones, PDAs, and other devices. Symbian OS is an open source
multitasking operating system designed for smart phones. 
What Is the Purpose of Several Stand-Alone Utility Programs?
Stand-alone utility programs offer improvements over features built into the operating system or provide features not included
in the operating system. An antivirus program protects computers against a virus, or potentially damaging computer program,
by identifying and removing any computer viruses. A spyware remover detects and deletes spyware and similar programs. An
adware remover detects and deletes adware. An anti-spam program attempts to remove spam before it reaches your inbox.
Web filtering software restricts access to certain material on the Web. A phishing filter warns or blocks you from potentially
fraudulent or suspicious Web sites. A pop-up blocker stops pop-up ads from displaying on Web pages. A file compression
utility shrinks the size of a file. A file conversion utility transforms the contents of a file from one format to another. A media
player allows you to view images and animation, listen to audio, and watch video files on a computer. CD/DVD burning
software writes on a recordable or rewritable CD or DVD. A personal computer maintenance utility identifies and fixes
operating system or disk problems and improves a computer’s performance.

Buyer’s Guide
How to Purchase a Personal Computer
A
t some point, perhaps while you are taking this course,
you may decide to buy a personal computer. The deci-
sion is an important one and will require an investment
of both time and money. Like many buyers, you may have lit-
tle computer experience and find yourself unsure of how to
proceed.You can get started by talking to your friends,
coworkers, and instructors about their computers. What type
of computers did they buy? Why? For what purposes do
they use their computers? You also should answer the fol-
lowing three questions to help narrow your choices to a 
specific computer type, before reading this Buyer’s Guide.
Do you want a desktop computer 
or mobile computer?
A desktop
computer (Figure 1a) is designed as a
stationary device that sits on or below a desk 
or table in a location such as a home, office, or
dormitory room. A desktop computer must be
plugged in an electrical outlet to operate. A
mobile computer, such as a notebook computer
or Tablet PC (Figure 1b), is smaller than a desk-
top computer, more portable, and has a battery
that allows you to operate it for a period without
an electrical outlet. 
Desktop computers are a good option if you
work mostly in one place and have plenty of
space in your work area. Desktop computers 
generally give you more performance for your
money. Today, manufacturers are putting more
emphasis on style by offering bright colors and
stylish displays so that your computer looks
attractive if it is in an area of high visibility.
Increasingly, more corporations are buying
mobile computers to take advantage of their
portability while traveling and at home. The past
disadvantages of mobile computers, such as
lower processor speeds, poor-quality monitors,
weight, short battery life, and significantly higher
prices, have all but disappeared. Today, hard disk
speed, capacity, processor speed, and graphics
capability in notebook computers are equal to, 
if not better than, desktop computers.

Mobile computers used to have several drawbacks,
including the lack of high-end capabilities. Today’s high-end
notebook computers include most of the capabilities of a
good desktop computer. Manufacturers have made great
strides in improving durability and battery life. Most note-
book computers are 1.5 to 2 inches thick and weigh less than
10 pounds, making them very portable and easy to carry.
For what purposes will you use the computer?
Having a general idea of the purposes for which
you want to use your computer will help you
decide on the type of computer to buy. At this point in
your research, it is not necessary to know the exact appli-
cation software titles or version numbers you might want
to use. Knowing that you plan to use the computer
primarily to create word processing, spreadsheet, data-
base, and presentation documents, however, will point you
in the direction of a desktop or notebook computer. If you
want the portability of a smart phone or PDA, but you
need more computing power, then a Tablet PC may be the
best alternative. You also must consider that some applica-
tion software runs only on a Mac, while others run only on
a PC with the Windows operating system. Still other soft-
ware may run only on a PC running the Linux operating
system.
Should the computer be compatible with the
computers at school or work?
If you plan to
bring work home, telecommute, or take distance
education courses, then you should purchase a computer
that is compatible with those at school or work. 
Compatibility is primarily a software issue. If your 
computer runs the same operating system version, such as
Microsoft Windows Vista, and the same application soft-
ware, such as Microsoft Office 2007, then your computer
will be able to read documents created at school or work
and vice versa. Incompatible hardware can become an issue
if you plan to connect directly to a school or office network
using a cable or wireless technology. You usually can obtain
the minimum system requirements from the Information
Technology department at your school or workplace.
After evaluating the answers to these three questions,
you should have a general idea of how you plan to use
your computer and the type of computer you want to buy.
Once you have decided on the type of computer you want,
you can follow the guidelines presented in this Buyer’s
Guide to help you purchase a specific computer, along
with software, peripherals, and other accessories.
Many of the desktop computer guidelines presented
also apply to the purchase of a mobile computer. Later 
sections in this Buyer’s Guide address additional 
purchasing considerations.
This Buyer’s Guide concentrates on recommendations
for purchasing a desktop computer or mobile computer.
HOW TO PURCHASE A
DESKTOP COMPUTER 
O
nce you have decided that a desktop computer is
most suited to your computing needs, the next step
is to determine specific software, hardware, periph-
eral devices, and services to purchase, as well as where
to buy the computer.
Determine the specific software you want 
to use on your computer.
Before deciding to 
purchase software, be sure it contains the features
necessary for the tasks you want to perform. Rely on the
computer users in whom you have confidence to help you
decide on the software to use. The minimum requirements
of the software you select may determine the operating
system (Microsoft Windows Vista, Linux, Mac OS X) you
need. If you have decided to use a particular operating 
system that does not support software you want to use,
you may be able to purchase similar software from other
manufacturers. 
Many Web sites and trade magazines, such as those
listed in Figure 2, provide reviews of software products.
These Web sites frequently have articles that rate computers
and software on cost, performance, and support.
Your hardware requirements depend on the minimum
requirements of the software you will run on your computer.
Some software requires more memory and disk space than
others, as well as additional input, output, and storage
devices. For example, suppose you want to run software
that can copy one CD’s or DVD’s contents directly to

another CD or DVD, without first copying the data to your
hard disk. To support that, you should consider a desktop
computer or a high-end notebook computer, because the
computer will need two CD or DVD drives: one that reads
from a CD or DVD, and one that reads from and writes on
a CD or DVD. If you plan to run software that allows your
computer to work as an entertainment system, then you
will need a CD or DVD drive, quality speakers, and an
upgraded sound card. 
Know the system requirements of the 
operating system.
After deciding the software
you want to run on your new computer, you need
to determine the operating system you want to use. If,
however, you purchase a new computer, chances are it 
will have the latest version of your preferred operating
system (Windows Vista, Linux, Mac OS X). Figure 3 lists
the minimum computer requirements of Windows Vista
versions.
Look for bundled software.
When you 
purchase a computer, it may come bundled with
software. Some sellers even let you choose which
software you want. Remember, however, that bundled 
software has value only if you would have purchased the
software even if it had not come with the computer. At 
the very least, you probably will want word processing
software and a browser to access the Internet. If you need
additional programs, such as a spreadsheet, a database, or
presentation graphics, consider purchasing or downloading
Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Works, OpenOffice.org, or
Sun StarOffice, which include several programs at a
reduced price. 
Avoid buying the least powerful computer
available.
Once you know the application 
software you want to use, you then can consider
the following important criteria about the computer’s
components: (1) processor speed, (2) size and types of
memory (RAM) and storage, (3) types of input/output
devices, (4) types of ports and adapter cards, and (5) types
of communications devices. You also need to consider if
the computer is upgradeable and to what extent you are
able to upgrade. For example, all manufacturers limit the
amount of memory you can add. The information in
Figures 4 and 5 on pages 282 through 284 can help you
determine what system components are best for you.
Figure 4 outlines considerations for specific hardware
components. Figure 5 provides a Base Components 
worksheet that lists PC recommendations for each cate-
gory of user discussed in this book: Home User, Small
Office/Home Office User, Mobile User, Power User, and
Large Business User. In the worksheet, the Home User 
category is divided into two groups: Application Home
User and Game Home User.
Computer technology changes rapidly, meaning a
computer that seems powerful enough today may not
serve your computing needs in a few years. In fact, 
studies show that many users regret not buying a more
powerful computer. To avoid this, plan to buy a computer
that will last you for two to three years. You can help
delay obsolescence by purchasing the fastest processor, the
most memory, and the largest hard disk you can afford. If
you must buy a less powerful computer, be sure you can
upgrade it with additional memory, components, and
peripheral devices as your computer requirements grow.
Consider upgrades to the mouse, keyboard,
monitor, printer, microphone, and speakers.
You use these peripheral devices to interact with
your computer, so you should make sure they are up to
your standards. Review the peripheral devices listed in
Figure 4 and then visit both local computer dealers and
large retail stores to test the computers on display. Ask the
salesperson what input and output devices would be best
for you and whether you should upgrade beyond what
comes standard. Consider purchasing a wireless keyboard
and wireless mouse to eliminate bothersome wires on your
desktop. A few extra dollars spent on these components
when you initially purchase a computer can extend its 
usefulness by years.

Special Feature
CD/DVD Drives: Most computers come with a DVD±RW combination drive and/or Blu-ray or HD DVD drive. A DVD±RW drive 
allows you to read DVDs and CDs and to write data on (burn) a DVD or CD. It also will allow you to store and share video 
files, digital photos, and other large files with other people who have access to a DVD±RW drive or Blu-ray HD or DVD drive. 
A DVD has a capacity of at least 4.7 GB versus the 650 MB capacity of a CD. An HD DVD has a minimum capacity of 45 GB.
Card Reader/Writer: A card reader/writer is useful for transferring data directly to and from a removable flash memory card, 
such as the ones used in your camera or audio player. Make sure the card reader/writer can read from and write on the 
flash memory cards that you use.
Digital Camera: Consider an inexpensive point-and-shoot digital camera. They are small enough to carry 
around, usually operate automatically in terms of lighting and focus, and contain storage cards for storing 
photos. A 6-megapixel camera with a 512 MB storage card is sufficient for all personal picture taking needs,
including creating images for use on the Web or to send via e-mail. 
Digital Video Capture Device: A digital video capture device allows you to connect your computer to a camcorder 
or VCR and record, edit, manage, and then write video back on a VCR tape, a CD, or a DVD. To create quality video 
(true 30 frames per second, full-sized TV), the digital video capture device should have a USB 2.0 or FireWire port. 
External Hard Disk: An external hard disk can serve many purposes: it can serve as extra storage for your computer, 
provide a way to store and transport large files or large quantities of files, and provide a convenient way to backup data 
on other internal and external hard disks. External hard disks can be purchased with the same amount of capacity as any 
internal disk. If you are going to use it as a backup to your internal hard disk, you should purchase an external hard 
disk with at least as much capacity as your internal hard disk. Many disk controllers come with a RAID option that 
allows you to replicate data among multiple hard disks.
Fingerprint Reader: For added security, you may want to consider purchasing a fingerprint reader. It helps prevent 
unauthorized access to your computer and also allows you to log onto Web sites quickly via your fingerprint, rather 
than entering a user name and password each time you access the site. Most use a USB connection and require 
software installation.
Hard Disk: It is recommended that you buy a computer with 320 GB if your primary interests are browsing the Web
and using e-mail and Office suite-type applications; 1 TB if you also want to edit digital photos; 2.5 TB if you plan to edit 
digital video or manipulate large audio files even occasionally; and 200 to 500 GB if you will edit digital video, movies, 
or photography often; store audio files and music; or consider yourself to be a power user. It also is recommended that 
you use Serial ATA (SATA) as opposed to Parallel ATA (PATA). SATA has many advantages over PATA, including support for 
Plug and Play devices. Internal hard disk controllers also are available with the RAID option for added data protection.
Joystick/Wheel: If you use your computer to play games, then you will want to purchase a joystick or a wheel. These
devices, especially the more expensive ones, provide for realistic game play with force feedback, programmable 
buttons, and specialized levers and wheels.
Keyboard: The keyboard is one of the more important devices used to communicate with the computer. For this 
reason, make sure the keyboard you purchase has 101 to 105 keys, is comfortable and easy to use, and has a USB 
connection. A wireless keyboard should be considered, especially if you have a small desk area.
Microphone: If you plan to record audio or use speech recognition to enter text and commands, 
then purchase a close-talk headset with gain adjustment support.
Modem: Most computers come with a modem so that you can use your telephone line to access 
the Internet. Some modems also have fax capabilities. Your modem should be rated at 56 Kbps.
Monitor: The monitor is where you will view documents, read e-mail messages, and view pictures. A minimum of a 
17" screen is recommended, but if you are planning to use your computer for graphic design or game playing, then you 
may want to purchase a 19" or 21" monitor. The LCD flat panel monitor should be considered, especially if space is 
an issue. Instead of a large, wide screen monitor, you may want to consider a side-by-side monitor setup.
Mouse: As you work with your computer, you use the mouse constantly. For this reason, spend a few extra dollars, if 
necessary, and purchase a mouse with an optical or laser sensor and USB connection. The optical or laser sensor replaces the 
need for a mouse ball, which means you do not need a mouse pad. For a PC, make sure your mouse has a wheel, which acts 
as a third button in addition to the top two buttons on the left and right. An ergonomic design also is important because your 
hand is on the mouse most of the time when you are using your computer. A wireless mouse should be considered to eliminate 
the cord and allow you to work at short distances from your computer.

Buyer’s Guide
Ports: Depending on how you are using your computer, you may need anywhere from 4 to 10 USB 2.0 ports. 
USB 2.0 ports have become the connection of choice in the computer industry. They offer an easy way to 
connect peripheral devices such as printers, digital cameras, portable media players, etc. Many computers 
intended for home or professional audio/video use have built-in FireWire ports. Most personal computers 
come with a minimum of six USB 2.0 ports, two FireWire ports, and an Ethernet port.
Port Hub Expander: If you plan to connect several peripheral devices to your computer at the same time, then you need to 
be concerned with the number of ports available on your computer. If your computer does not have enough ports, then you 
should purchase a port hub expander. A port hub expander plugs in a single FireWire port or USB port and provides several 
additional ports.
Printer: Your two basic printer choices are ink-jet and laser. Color ink-jet printers cost on average between $50 
and $300. Laser printers cost from $200 to $2,000. In general, the cheaper the printer, the lower the resolution 
and speed, and the more often you are required to change the ink cartridge or toner. Laser printers print faster 
and with a higher quality than an ink-jet, and their toner on average costs less. If you want color, then go with a 
high-end ink-jet printer to ensure quality of print. Duty cycle (the number of pages you expect to print each month) 
also should be a determining factor. If your duty cycle is on the low end — hundreds of pages per month — then 
stay with a high-end ink-jet printer, rather than purchasing a laser printer. If you plan to print photos taken with a 
digital camera, then you should purchase a photo printer. A photo printer is a dye-sublimation printer or an ink-jet 
printer with higher resolution and features that allow you to print quality photos. 
Processor: For a PC, an Intel Core 2 Quad processor at 2.40 GHz is more than enough processor power for 
application home and small office/home office users. Game home, large business, and power users 
should upgrade to faster processors. 
RAM: RAM plays a vital role in the speed of your computer. Make sure the computer you purchase has at 
least 1 GB of RAM. If you have extra money to invest in your computer, then consider increasing the RAM. 
The extra money for RAM will be well spent because more RAM typically translates into more speed.
Scanner: The most popular scanner purchased with a computer today is the flatbed scanner. When evaluating 
a flatbed scanner, check the color depth and resolution. Do not buy anything less than a color depth of 48 bits 
and a resolution of 1200 x 2400 dpi. The higher the color depth, the more accurate the color. A higher resolution 
picks up the more subtle gradations of color. 
Sound Card: Many computers come with a standard sound card that supports Dolby 5.1 
surround and are capable of recording and playing digital audio. Make sure they are 
suitable in the event you decide to use your computer as an entertainment or gaming system.
Speakers: Once you have a good sound card, quality speakers and a separate subwoofer that amplifies 
the bass frequencies of the speakers can turn your computer into a premium stereo system. 
Web Cam: A Web cam is a small digital video camera used to capture and display live video (in some cases 
with sound), on a Web page. You also can capture, edit, and share video and still photos. The camera sits 
on your monitor or desk. Recommended minimum specifications include 640 x 480 resolution, a video with 
a rate of 30 frames per second, and a USB 2.0 or FireWire port.
USB Flash Drive: If you work on different computers and need access to the same data and information, then this 
portable miniature mobile storage device is ideal. USB flash drive capacity varies from 64 MB to 16 GB.
Video Card: Most standard video cards satisfy the monitor display needs of application home and small 
office users. If you are a game home user or a graphic designer, you will want to upgrade to a higher 
quality video card. The higher refresh rates will further enhance the display of games, graphics, 
and movies.
Wireless LAN Access Point: A wireless LAN access point allows you to network several computers, so that 
they can share files and access the Internet through a single cable modem or DSL connection. Each device that you 
connect requires a wireless card. A wireless LAN access point can offer a range of operations up to several hundred 
feet, so be sure the device has a high-powered antenna.

Determine whether you want to use telephone
lines or broadband (cable or DSL) to access
the Internet.
If your computer has a modem,
then you can access the Internet using a standard telephone
line. Ordinarily, you call a local or toll-free 800 number to
connect to an ISP (see Guideline 7). Using a dial-up Internet
connection usually is relatively inexpensive but slow.
DSL and cable connections provide much faster Internet
connections, which are ideal if you want faster file download
speeds for software, digital photos, and music. As you
would expect, they can be more expensive than a dial-up
connection. DSL also may require that you subscribe to an
ISP. DSL works just like a dial-up connection from a users
point of view, but is always connected and has a much faster
connection speed. Cable is available through your local cable
television provider and some online service providers
(OSPs). If you get cable, then you would not use a separate
Internet service provider or online service provider.

If you are using a dial-up or wireless 
connection to connect to the Internet, then
select an ISP or OSP.
You can access the
Internet in one of two ways: an ISP or an OSP. Both pro-
vide Internet access for a monthly fee that ranges from $10
to $55. Local ISPs offer Internet access to users in a limited
geographic region, through local telephone numbers.
National ISPs provide access for users nationwide (includ-
ing mobile users), through local and toll-free telephone
numbers, cable, and DSL. Because of their size, national
ISPs generally offer more services and have a larger techni-
cal support staff than local ISPs. OSPs furnish Internet
access as well as members-only features for users nation-
wide. Figure 6 lists several national ISPs and OSPs. Before
you choose an ISP or OSP, compare such features as the
number of access hours, monthly fees, available services
(e-mail, Web page hosting, chat), and reliability.
Use a worksheet to
compare computers,
services, and other
considerations.
You can use
a separate sheet of paper to take
notes on each vendor’s computer
and then summarize the infor-
mation on a worksheet, such 
as the one shown in Figure 7.
You can use Figure 7 to compare
prices for either a PC or a Mac.
Most companies advertise a price
for a base computer that includes
components housed in the sys-
tem unit (processor, RAM, sound
card, video card), disk drives
(hard disk, CD-ROM, CD-RW,
DVD-ROM, and DVD6RW), a
keyboard, mouse, monitor,
printer, speakers, and modem. 
Be aware, however, that some
advertisements list prices for
computers with only some of
these components. Monitors 
and printers, for example, often
are not included in a base com-
puter’s price. Depending on 
how you plan to use the com-
puter, you may want to invest 
in additional or more powerful
components. When you are com-
paring the prices of computers,
make sure you are comparing
identical or similar configurations.

PC or MAC Cost Comparison Worksheet
Dealers list prices for computers with most of these components (instead of listing individual component costs). Some dealers do not supply a monitor. Some dealers 
offer significant discounts, but you must subscribe to an Internet service for a specified period to receive the dicounted price. To compare computers, enter overall system 
price at top and enter a 0 (zero) for components included in the computer cost.  For any additional components not covered in the computer price, enter the cost in the 
appropriate cells.

If you are buying a new computer, you have
several purchasing options: buying from your
school bookstore, a local computer dealer, a
local large retail store, or ordering by mail via tele-
phone or the Web.
Each purchasing option has certain
advantages. Many college bookstores, for example, sign
exclusive pricing agreements with computer manufacturers
and, thus, can offer student discounts. Local dealers and
local large retail stores, however, more easily can provide
hands-on support. Mail-order companies that sell computers
by telephone or online via the Web (Figure 8) often provide
the lowest prices, but extend less personal service. Some
major mail-order companies, however, have started to pro-
vide next-business-day, on-site services. A credit card usually
is required to buy from a mail-order company. Figure 9 lists
some of the more popular mail-order companies and their
Web site addresses.
If you are buying a used computer, stay with
name brands such as Dell, Acer, Hewlett-
Packard, and Apple.
Although brand-name
equipment can cost more, most brand-name computers
have longer, more comprehensive warranties, are better
supported, and have more authorized centers for repair
services. As with new computers, you can purchase a 
used computer from local computer dealers, local large
retail stores, or mail order via the telephone or the Web.
Classified ads and used computer sellers offer additional
outlets for purchasing used computers. Figure 10 lists
several major used computer brokers and their Web site
addresses.

If you have a computer and are upgrading to 
a new one, then consider selling or trading 
in the old one.
If you are a replacement buyer,
your older computer still may have value. If you cannot
sell the computer through the classified ads, via a Web site,
or to a friend, then ask if the computer dealer will buy
your old computer. An increasing number of companies
are taking trade-ins, but do not expect too much money for
your old computer. Other companies offer free disposal of
your old PC.
Be aware of hidden costs.
Before purchasing,
be sure to consider any additional costs associated
with buying a computer, such as an additional 
telephone line, a cable or DSL modem, an uninterruptible
power supply (UPS), computer furniture, a USB flash drive,
paper, and computer training classes you may want to take.
Depending on where you buy your computer, the seller
may be willing to include some or all of these in the 
computer purchase price.

HOW TO PURCHASE A
NOTEBOOK COMPUTER
I
f you need computing capability when you travel 
or to use in lecture or meetings, you may find a 
notebook computer to be an appropriate choice.
The guidelines mentioned in the previous section 
also apply to the purchase of a notebook computer.
The following are additional considerations unique 
to notebook computers.
Purchase a notebook computer with a 
sufficiently large screen.
Active-matrix screens
display high-quality color that is viewable from all
angles. Less expensive, passive-matrix screens sometimes are
difficult to see in low-light conditions and cannot be viewed
from an angle. 
Notebook computers typically come with a 12.1-inch, 
13.3-inch, 14.1-inch, 15.4-inch, or 17-inch display. For most
users, a 14.1-inch display is satisfactory. If you intend to use
your notebook computer as a desktop computer replacement,
however, you may opt for a 15.7-inch or 17-inch display. The
WSXGA1 standard (1680 3 1050) is popular with 17" dis-
plays, so if you intend to watch HD movies on your com-
puter, take this into consideration. Dell offers a notebook
computer with a 20.1-inch display that looks like a briefcase
when closed. Notebook computers with these larger displays
weigh seven to ten pounds, however, so if you travel a lot and
portability is essential, you might want a lighter computer
with a smaller display. The lightest notebook computers,
which weigh less than 3 pounds, are equipped with 
a 12.1-inch display. Regardless of size, the resolution of the
display should be at least 1024 3 768 pixels. To compare 
the monitor size on various notebook computers, visit the
company Web sites in Figure 11.
Consider more than just price.
The lowest-
cost computer may not be the best long-term buy.
Consider such intangibles as the vendor’s time in
business, the vendor’s regard for quality, and the vendor’s
reputation for support. If you need to upgrade your com-
puter often, you may want to consider a leasing arrange-
ment, in which you pay monthly lease fees, but can upgrade
or add on to your computer as your equipment needs
change. No matter what type of buyer you are, insist on a
30-day, no-questions-asked return policy on your computer.
Avoid restocking fees.
Some companies
charge a restocking fee of 10 to 20 percent as part
of their money-back return policy. In some cases,
no restocking fee for hardware is applied, but it is applied
for software. Ask about the existence and terms of any
restocking policies before you buy.
Use a credit card to purchase your new 
computer.
Many credit cards offer purchase
protection and extended warranty benefits that
cover you in case of loss of or damage to purchased goods.
Paying by credit card also gives you time to install and use
the computer before you have to pay for it. Finally, if you
are dissatisfied with the computer and are unable to reach
an agreement with the seller, paying by credit card gives
you certain rights regarding withholding payment until
the dispute is resolved. Check your credit card terms for
specific details.
Consider purchasing an extended warranty
or service plan.
If you use your computer for
business or require fast resolution to major com-
puter problems, consider purchasing an extended warranty
or a service plan through a local dealer or third-party com-
pany. Most extended warranties cover the repair and
replacement of computer components beyond the standard
warranty. Most service plans ensure that your technical
support calls receive priority response from technicians.
You also can purchase an on-site service plan that states
that a technician will come to your home, work, or school
within 24 hours. If
your computer
includes a war-
ranty and service
agreement for a
year or less, think
about extending
the service for two
or three years
when you buy the
computer.

Experiment with different keyboards and
pointing devices.
Notebook computer 
keyboards are far less standardized than those 
for desktop computers. Some notebook computers, for
example, have wide wrist rests, while others have none,
and keyboard layouts on notebook computers often vary.
Notebook computers also use a range of pointing devices,
including pointing sticks, touchpads, and trackballs. Before
you purchase a notebook computer, try various types of
keyboard and pointing devices to determine which is easi-
est for you to use. Regardless of the pointing device you
select, you also may want to purchase a regular mouse to
use when you are working at a desk or other large surface.
Make sure the notebook computer you 
purchase has a CD and/or DVD drive.
Most notebook computers come with a CD and/or 
a DVD drive. Although DVD drives are slightly more
expensive, they allow you to play CDs and DVD movies
using your notebook computer and hear the sound through
headphones 
If necessary, upgrade the processor,
memory, and disk storage at the time of 
purchase.
As with a desktop computer, 
upgrading your notebook computer’s memory and disk
storage usually is less expensive at the time of initial pur-
chase. Some disk storage is custom designed for notebook
computer manufacturers, meaning an upgrade might not be
available in the future. If you are purchasing a lightweight
notebook computer, then it should include at least an Intel
Core 2 Quad processor, 1 GB RAM, and 250 GB of storage. 
The availability of built-in ports and slots
and a port extender on a notebook computer
is important.
A notebook computer does not
have much room to add adapter cards. If you know the pur-
pose for which you plan to use your notebook computer,
then you can determine the ports you will need. Most note-
books come with common ports, such as a mouse port, IrDA
port, serial port, parallel port, video port, a FireWire port,
multiple USB ports, and a network port. If you plan to con-
nect your notebook computer to a TV, however, then you
will need a PCtoTV port. To optimize TV viewing, you may
want to consider DVI or HDMI interfaces. If you want to
connect to networks at school or in various offices via a net-
work cable, make sure the notebook computer you purchase
has a network port. If your notebook computer does not
contain a network port, then you will have to purchase an
external network card that slides into an expansion slot in
your notebook computer, as well as a network cable. You
also may want to consider adding a card reader. While
newer portable media players connect to a USB port, older
ones require a FireWire port.
Special Feature
Purchase a notebook computer with a built-in 
wireless network connection.
A wireless network
connection (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, WiMAX, etc.) 
can be useful when you travel or as part of a home network.
Increasingly more airports, hotels, and cafes have wireless net-
works that allow you to connect to the Internet. Many users today
are setting up wireless home networks. With a wireless home net-
work, the desktop computer functions as the server, and your
notebook computer can access the desktop computer from any
location in the house to share files and hardware, such as a
printer, and browse the Web. Most home wireless networks 
allow connections from distances of 150 to 800 feet. 
If you are going to use your notebook computer for
long periods without access to an electrical outlet,
purchase a second battery.
The trend among note-
book computer users today is power and size over battery life,
and notebook computer manufacturers have picked up on this.
Many notebook computer users today are willing to give up
longer battery life for a larger screen, faster processor, and more
storage. In addition, some manufacturers typically sell the note-
book with the lowest capacity battery. For this reason, you need to
be careful in choosing a notebook computer if you plan to use it
without access to electrical outlets for long periods, such as an air-
plane flight. You also might want to purchase a second battery as
a backup. If you anticipate running your notebook computer on
batteries frequently, choose a computer that uses lithium-ion bat-
teries, which last longer than nickel cadmium or nickel hydride
batteries.
If you plan to use your notebook computer for
note-taking at school or in meetings, consider a
notebook computer that converts to a Tablet PC.
Some computer manufacturers have developed convertible 
Tablet PCs that allow the screen to rotate 180 degrees on a central
hinge and then fold down to cover the keyboard (Figure 12). You
then can use a digital pen to enter text or drawings into the com-
puter by writing on the screen. Some notebook computers have
wide screens for better viewing and editing, and some even have
a screen on top of the unit in addition to the regular screen.

289
Purchase a well-padded and well-designed
carrying case.
An amply padded carrying 
case will protect your notebook computer from 
the bumps it will receive while traveling. A well-designed
carrying case will have room for accessories such as spare
CDs and DVDs, a user
manual, pens, and
paperwork (Figure 13).
your notebook computer has the ports required to
connect to the video projector.  You also may consider
purchasing a notebook computer with a built-in Web 
cam for video conferencing purposes.
For improved security and convenience,
consider a fingerprint reader.

a million notebook computers are stolen or lost
each year. If you have critical information stored on your
notebook computer, then consider purchasing one with a
fingerprint reader (Figure 15) to protect the data if your
computer is stolen or lost. Fingerprint security offers a
level of protection that extends well beyond the standard
password protection. If your notebook computer is stolen,
the odds of recovering it improve dramatically with anti-
theft tracking software. Manufacturers claim recovery rates
of 90 percent or more for notebooks using their product.
For convenience, fingerprint readers also allow you to log
onto several Web sites via your fingerprint, rather than
entering a user name and password information.

If you travel, obtain a set of electrical 
and telephone adapters and purchase an
accident and theft protection plan.
When
traveling overseas, it is important to know that different
countries use different outlets for electrical and telephone
connections. Several manufacturers sell sets of adapters
that will work in most countries. You also may want to
consider accident and theft protection by purchasing a
protection plan or insurance. Some devices contain built-in
recovery mechanisms (like LoJack for cars) that make
tracking and recovery possible.
If you plan to connect your notebook 
computer to a video projector, make sure the
notebook computer is compatible with the
video projector.
You should check, for example, 
to be sure that your notebook computer will allow you to
display an image on the computer screen and projection
device at the same time (Figure 14). Also, ensure that

Make sure the Tablet PC fits your mobile
computing needs.
The Tablet PC is not for
every mobile user. If you find yourself in need of a
computer in class or you are spending more time in meet-
ings than in your office, then the Tablet PC may be the
answer. Before you invest money in a Tablet PC, however,
determine the programs you plan to use on it. You should
not buy a Tablet PC simply because it is an interesting type
of computer. For additional information on the Tablet PC,
visit the Web sites listed in Figure 17. You may have to use
the search capabilities on the home page of the companies
listed to locate information about the Tablet PC.

HOW TO PURCHASE A
TABLET PC 
T
he Tablet PC (Figure 16) combines the mobility
features of a traditional notebook computer with
the simplicity of pencil and paper, because you
can create and save Office-type documents by writing
and drawing directly on the screen with a digital pen.
Tablet PCs use the Windows Tablet Technology in the
Windows Vista operating system. A notebook computer
and a Tablet PC have many similarities. For this reason,
if you are considering purchasing a Tablet PC, review
the guidelines for purchasing a notebook computer, as
well as the guidelines below.
Decide whether you want a convertible or
pure Tablet PC.
Convertible Tablet PCs have 
an attached keyboard and look like a notebook
computer. You rotate the screen and lay it flat against the
computer for note-taking. The pure Tablet PCs are slim
and lightweight, weighing less than four pounds. They
have the capability of easily docking at a desktop to gain
access to a large monitor, keyboard, and mouse. If you
spend a lot of time attending lectures or meetings, then 
the pure Tablet PC is ideal. Acceptable specifications for 
a Tablet PC are shown in Figure 18.

Be sure the weight and dimensions are 
conducive to portability.
The weight and
dimensions of the Tablet PC are important because
you carry it around like a notepad. The Tablet PC you buy
should weigh four pounds or less. Its dimensions should
be approximately 12 inches by 9 inches by 1.2 inches.
Port availability, battery life, and durability
are even more important with a Tablet PC
than they are with a notebook computer.
Make sure the Tablet PC you purchase has the ports
required for the applications you plan to run.  As with 
any mobile computer, battery life is important especially 
if you plan to use your Tablet PC for long periods without
access to an electrical outlet. A Tablet PC must be durable
because if you use it the way it was designed to be used,
then you will be handling it much like you handle a pad 
of paper.
Experiment with different models of the
Tablet PC to find the digital pen that works
best for you.
The key to making use of the
Tablet PC is to be comfortable with its handwriting capa-
bilities and on-screen keyboard. Not only is the digital pen
used to write on the screen (Figure 19), you also use it to
make gestures to complete tasks, in a manner similar to 
the way you use a mouse. Figure 20 compares the stan-
dard point-and-click of a mouse with the gestures made
with a digital pen. Other gestures with the digital pen
replicate some of the commonly used keys on a keyboard. 
Check out the comfort level of handwriting 
in different positions.
You should be able to
handwrite on a Tablet PC with your hand resting
on the screen. You also should be able to handwrite hold-
ing the Tablet PC in one hand, as well as with it sitting in
your lap.
Make sure the LCD display device has a 
resolution high enough to take advantage of
Microsoft’s ClearType technologies.
Tablet
PCs use a digitizer under a standard 10.4-inch motion-
sensitive LCD display to make the writing experience on 
the screen feel like writing on paper. To ensure you get the
maximum benefits from the new ClearType technology,
make sure the LCD display has a resolution of 800 3 600 
in landscape mode and a 600 3 800 in portrait mode. 
Test the built-in Tablet PC microphone 
and speakers.
Although most application 
software, including Microsoft Office, recognizes
human speech, it is important that the Tablet PC’s built-in
microphone operates at an acceptable level. If the micro-
phone is not to your liking, you may want to purchase a
close-talk headset with your Tablet PC. Increasingly more
users are sending information as audio files, rather than
relying solely on text. For this reason, you also should
check the speakers on the Tablet PC to make sure they
meet your standards.
Consider a Tablet PC with a built-in Web
cam.
A Web cam adds streaming video and still
photography capabilities to your Tablet PC, while
still allowing you to take notes in lectures or meetings. 
Review the docking capabilities of the Tablet
PC.
The Tablet Technology in the Windows Vista
operating system supports a grab-and-go form of
docking, so you can pick up and take a docked Tablet PC
with you, just as you would pick up a notepad on your
way to a meeting (Figure 21).

Special Feature
Wireless access to the Internet and your 
e-mail is essential with a Tablet PC.
Make
sure the Tablet PC has wireless networking
(Bluetooth, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, WiMAX, etc.), so you can access
the Internet and your e-mail anytime and anywhere. 
Your Tablet PC also should include standard network 
connections, such as dial-up and Ethernet connections.
Review available accessories to purchase
with your Tablet PC.
Tablet PC accessories
include docking stations, mouse units, keyboards,
security cables, additional memory and storage, protective
handgrips, screen protectors, and various types of digital
pens.
HOW TO PURCHASE A PERSONAL 
MOBILE DEVICE
W
hether you choose a smart phone, Ultra-Mobile PC, or portable media player,
handheld navigation device, or handheld game console depends on where,
when, and how you will use the device. If you need to stay organized and in
touch when on the go, then a smart phone or Ultra-Mobile PC may be the right choice.
Choose a handheld navigation device if you often need directions or information about
your surroundings. If you plan to relax and play games, then a handheld game console
may be right for you. Busy professionals who are on the move often carry more than
one personal mobile device.
This section lists guidelines you should consider when purchasing a smart phone,
Ultra-Mobile PC, portable media player, handheld navigation device, handheld game
console, or any other personal mobile device.You also should visit the Web sites
listed in Figure 22 to gather more information about the type of personal mobile
device that best suits your computing needs.
Determine the programs you plan to run on
your device.
Most smart phones and other
personal mobile devices can handle basic 
organizer-type software such as a calendar, address book,
and notepad. Portable media players and handheld navi-
gation devices usually have the fewest programs available
to run on them. Ultra-Mobile PCs usually have the most
programs available because the devices can run almost any
personal computer software. The availability of other soft-
ware depends on the operating system you choose. The
depth and breadth of software for the Palm OS is signifi-
cant, with more than 20,000 basic programs and more than
600 wireless programs. Devices that run Windows-based
operating systems, such as Windows Mobile, may have
fewer programs available, but the operating system and
application software are similar to those with which you
are familiar, such as Word and Excel. When choosing a
handheld game console, consider whether your favorite
games are available for the device. Consider if you want
extras on the device, such as the capability of playing
media files.
Consider how much you want to pay.
The
price of a personal mobile device can range from
$100 to more than $2,000, depending on its capa-
bilities. Some Palm OS devices are at the lower end of 
the cost spectrum, and Ultra-Mobile PCs often are at the
higher end. A personal mobile device will be less expen-
sive than a smart phone with a similar configuration. For
the latest prices, capabilities, and accessories, visit the Web
sites listed in Figure 22.
Determine whether you need wireless
Internet access and e-mail or mobile phone
capabilities with your device.
Smart phones
often give you access to e-mail and other data and Internet
services. Some smart phones, Ultra-Mobile PCs, and hand-
held game consoles include wireless networking capability
to allow you to connect to the Internet wirelessly. These
wireless features and services allow personal mobile
device users to access real-time information from any-
where to help make decisions while on the go. Most
portable media players do not include the capability to
access Internet services.
C6672_SF07_pp4.qxd  1/30/08  2:21 PM  Page 292

293
For wireless devices, determine how and
where you will use the service.
When 
purchasing a wireless device, you must subscribe
to a wireless service. Determine if the wireless network
(carrier) you choose has service in the area where you 
plan to use the device. Some networks have high-speed
data networks only in certain areas, such as large cities 
or business districts. Also, a few carriers allow you to use
your device in other countries. 
When purchasing a smart phone, determine if you plan 
to use the device more as a telephone or wireless data
device. Some smart phones, such as those based on the
Pocket PC Phone edition or the Palm OS, are geared more
for use as a personal mobile device and have a personal
mobile device form factor. Other smart phones, such as
those based on Microsoft Smartphone or Symbian operat-
ing systems, mainly are telephone devices that include
robust PIM functionality. Research in Motion Blackberry-
based smart phones include robust data features that are
oriented to accessing e-mail and wireless data services.
Make sure your device has enough memory
and storage.
Memory is a major issue for 
high-end devices that, for example, have color dis-
plays and wireless features. Without enough memory, the
performance level of your device will drop dramatically. If
you plan to purchase a high-end device running the Palm
OS operating system, the device should have at least 32
MB of RAM. If you plan to purchase a high-end device
running the Windows Mobile operating system, the device
should have at least 64 MB of RAM. An Ultra-Mobile 
PC can have 512 MB of RAM or more, while a handheld
navigation device may have over 2 GB of flash memory.
Many personal mobile devices include a hard disk for
storage. Portable media players, Ultra-Mobile PC, and some
smart phones include hard disks to store media and other
data. Consider how much media and other data you need
to store on your device. The hard disk size may range from
4 GB to more than 80 GB. 
Practice with the touch screen, handwriting
recognition, and built-in keyboard.
To enter
data into a smart phone and some Ultra-Mobile
PCs and handheld game consoles, you use a pen-like stylus
to handwrite on the screen or a keyboard. The keyboard
either slides out or is mounted on the front of the device.
With handwriting recognition, the device translates the
handwriting into a computerized font. You also can use the
stylus as a pointing device to select items on the screen and
enter data by tapping on an on-screen keyboard. By prac-
ticing data entry before buying a device, you can learn if
one device may be easier for you to use than another. You
also can buy third-party software to improve a device’s
handwriting recognition. 
Compare battery life.
Any mobile device
is good only if it has the power required to run.
The use of wireless networking will shorten bat-
tery time considerably. To help alleviate this problem, most
devices have incorporated rechargeable batteries that can
be recharged by
placing the
device in 
a cradle or
connecting
it to a
charger.

Seriously consider the importance of
ergonomics.
Will you put the device in your
pocket, a carrying case, or wear it on your belt?
How does it feel in your hand? Will you use it indoors 
or outdoors? Many screens are unreadable outdoors. Do
you need extra ruggedness, such as would be required 
in construction, in a plant, or in a warehouse? A smart
phone with a PDA form factor may be larger than a typical
PDA. A smart phone with a phone form factor may be
smaller, but have fewer capabilities.
Check out the accessories.
Determine which
accessories you want for your personal mobile
device. Accessories include carrying cases,
portable mini- and full-sized keyboards, removable stor-
age, modems, synchronization cradles and cables, car
chargers, wireless communications, global positioning
system modules, digital camera modules, expansion
cards, dashboard mounts, replacement styli, headsets,
microphones, and more.
Decide whether you want additional 
functionality.
In general, off-the-shelf Microsoft
operating system-based devices have broader
functionality than devices with other operating systems.
For example, voice-recording capability, e-book players,
and media players are standard on most Windows Mobile
devices. If you are leaning towards a Palm OS device 
and want these additional functions, you may need to
purchase additional software or expansion modules to add
them later. Determine whether your employer permits
devices with cameras on the premises, and if not, do not
consider devices with cameras. Some handheld game con-
soles include the capability to access the Web. High-end
handheld navigation devices may include destination
information, such as information about restaurants and
points of interest, an e-book reader, a media player, and
currency converter.
Determine whether synchronization of data
with other devices or personal computers is
important.
Most devices include a cradle that
connects to the USB or serial port on your computer so 
that you can synchronize data
on your device with your desk-
top or notebook computer.
Increasingly more devices are
Bluetooth and/or wireless net-
working enabled, which gives them
the capability of synchronizing wire-
lessly. Many devices today also have
an infrared port that allows you 
to synchronize data with any device
that has a similar infrared port, including
desktop and notebook computers or other
personal mobile devices.

C
omputer communications describes a process in which two or more computers or devices
transfer data, instructions, and information. Figure 8-1 shows a sample communications
system. Some communications involve cables and wires; others are sent wirelessly through
the air. As illustrated in this figure, communications systems contain all types of computers and
computing devices. For successful communications, you need the following:
• A sending device that initiates an instruction to transmit data, instructions, or information.
• A communications device that connects the sending device to a communications channel.
• A communications channel, or transmission media on which the data, instructions, or 
information travel.
• A communications device that connects the communications channel to a receiving device.
• A receiving device that accepts the transmission of data, instructions, or information.

C6672_CH08_pp3  1/30/08  2:22 PM  Page 296

All types of computers and mobile devices serve as sending and receiving devices in a 
communications system. This includes mainframe computers, servers, desktop computers, 
notebook computers, Tablet PCs, smart phones, portable media players, and GPS receivers. One
type of communications device that connects a communications channel to a sending or receiving
device such as a computer is a modem. Two examples of communications channels are cable
television lines and telephone lines.
USES OF COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
Computer communications are everywhere. Many require that users subscribe to an Internet
access provider. With other computer communications, an organization such as a business or
school provides communications services to employees, students, or customers. The following
pages discuss a variety of computer communications.

Wikis, RSS, VoIP, FTP, Web Folders, Video Conferencing, and Fax
Previous chapters discussed many uses of computer communications as they related to a 
particular topic. In the course of a day, it is likely you use, or use information generated by, 
one or more of the previously discussed communications technologies, which are outlined in 
Figure 8-2.
The following pages discuss a variety of other uses of communications that have not been 
discussed previously. These include wireless messaging services, wireless Internet access points,
cybercafés,  global positioning systems, collaboration, groupware, voice mail, and Web services.
Wireless Messaging Services
Users can send and receive wireless messages to 
and from smart phones, cell phones, handheld game con-
soles, and other personal mobile devices using three tech-
niques: text messaging, wireless instant messaging, and
picture/video messaging (Figure 8-3).
TEXT MESSAGING
A mobile device with text
messaging, also called SMS (short message service),
capability allows users to send and receive short text
messages on a phone or other mobile device. Text mes-
saging services typically provide users with several
options for sending and receiving messages:
• Mobile to Mobile: send a message from your mobile
device to another mobile device
• Mobile to E-Mail: send a message from your mobile
device to an e-mail address anywhere in the world
• Web to Mobile: send a message from a text messaging
Web site to a mobile device, or request that a Web site
alert a mobile device with breaking news and other
updates, such as sports scores, stock prices, and
weather forecasts
• Mobile to Provider: send a message by entering a 
four- or five-digit number assigned to a specific content
or wireless service provider, followed by the message,
such as a vote for a television program contestant 
WIRELESS INSTANT MESSAGING
Wireless instant 
messaging (IM) is a real-time Internet communications
service that allows wireless mobile devices to exchange
messages with one or more mobile devices or online
users. Some wireless Internet service providers partner
with IM services so that you can use your smart phone or
other mobile device to send and receive wireless instant
messages. With a compatible IM service, users have these
IM options:
• Mobile to Mobile: use a wireless instant messenger to
communicate between two mobile devices
• Mobile to Personal Computer: use a wireless instant
messenger to communicate between a mobile device
and a personal computer
• Web to Mobile: send or forward messages from a
personal computer’s instant messenger to a mobile
device

USES OF COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
PICTURE/VIDEO MESSAGING
With picture messaging, users can send pictures and sound files, 
as well as short text messages, to a phone or other personal mobile device, or a computer. 
With video messaging, users can send short video clips, usually about 30 seconds in length, 
in addition to all picture messaging services (read Ethics & Issues 8-1 for a related discussion).
Picture/video messaging service, also called MMS (multimedia message service), typically
provides users these options for sending and receiving messages:
• Mobile to Mobile: send the picture/video from your mobile device to another mobile device
• Mobile to E-Mail: send the picture/video from your mobile device to an e-mail address
anywhere in the world
High-Tech Cheating via Wireless Messaging Services
Several schools have banned student smart phones claiming that they disrupt classes and sometimes are used for illegal activities, such as
drug sales. Now, schools may have another reason to prohibit smart phones and other wireless devices among students. Once, teachers had 
to watch test-takers only to make sure that no one was copying from a neighbor’s paper or secretly referring to notes concealed under a desk.
Recently, however, some students have been caught using their smart phones’ messaging service to send each other answers to test ques-
tions. Others have been caught using camera phones to take pictures of tests and forwarding the images to other students who were sched-
uled to take the test at a later time. Some teachers fear that more students soon may be using wireless devices, such as gaming devices, to
communicate covertly with classmates during a test, or even to receive messages from sources outside the classroom. Some schools have
gone as far as installing electronic jamming equipment to stop wireless communications. To eliminate this high-tech method of cheating,
should smart phones, digital cameras, notebook computers, Tablet PCs, and other wireless devices be banned during lectures and exams?
Why or why not? Short of banning these devices, what, if anything, can schools do to prevent students from using them to cheat? Is it
possible for schools to seek a point of compromise so that they can both embrace the new technology and control it?

Wireless Internet Access Points
At home, work, school, and in many public locations, people connect wirelessly to the Internet
through a wireless Internet access point using mobile computers, smart phones, handheld game
consoles, or other devices. Users access wireless Internet access points with computers or devices
that have the necessary built-in wireless capability or the appropriate wireless network card, PC
Card, ExpressCard module, or USB network adapter (Figure 8-4). Two types of wireless Internet
access points are hot spots and mobile wireless networks.
A hot spot is a wireless network that provides Internet connections to mobile computers and other
devices. Through the hot spot, mobile users check e-mail, browse the Web, and access any service 
on the Internet. Three hot spot technologies are Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and Bluetooth. Wi-Fi hot spots pro-
vide wireless network connections to users in public locations such as airports, train stations, hotels,
convention centers, schools, campgrounds, shopping malls, bookstores, libraries, restaurants, and
coffee shops. The coverage range for WiMAX hot spots, can be much wider than Wi-Fi; for example,
they can cover an entire city. Bluetooth hot spots provide location-based services, such as sending
coupons or menus, to users whose enabled devices enter the coverage range. Sections later in this
chapter discuss Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and Bluetooth in more detail.
Some hot spots provide free Internet access, some charge a per-use fee, and others require users 
to subscribe to a wireless Internet service provider, to which they pay per access fees, daily fees, or 
a monthly fee. Per access fees average $3, daily fees range from $5 to $20, and monthly fees range
from $20 to $60 for unlimited access, with the higher monthly fee providing greater coverage areas.
A mobile wireless network provides users with high-speed Internet connections, as long as they 
are in the network’s range. A mobile wireless network usually includes most major cities and air-
ports. Subscription fees for unlimited monthly Internet access to a mobile wireless network through a
cell phone range from $30 to $50. Fees for notebook computer access are higher, ranging from $60 to
$80 per month.

Cybercafés
When mobile users travel without their notebook computer or Internet-enabled mobile device,
they can visit a cybercafé to access e-mail, the Web, and other Internet services. A cybercafé, or
Internet cafe, is a coffeehouse, restaurant, or other location that provides personal computers with
Internet access to its customers. Cybercafés exist in cities around the world. Although some provide
free Internet access, most charge a per-hour or per-minute fee. Some cybercafés also are hot spots.
Global Positioning Systems
A global positioning system (GPS) is a navigation system that consists of one or more earth-based
receivers that accept and analyze signals sent by satellites in order to determine the receiver’s
geographic location (Figure 8-5). A GPS receiver is a handheld, mountable, or embedded device
that contains an antenna, a radio receiver, and a processor. Many include a screen display that
shows an individual’s location on a map. Some also function as a portable media player.
Many mobile devices such as smart phones have GPS capability built into the device or as an
add-on feature. Some users carry a handheld GPS receiver; others mount a receiver to an object
such as an automobile, boat, airplane, farm and construction equipment, or computer.
The first and most used application of GPS technology is to assist people with determining where
they are located. The data obtained from a GPS, however, can be applied to a variety of other uses:
creating a map, ascertaining the best route between two points, locating a lost person or stolen
object, monitoring the movement of a person or object, determining altitude, and calculating speed.
Many vehicles use GPSs to provide drivers with directions or other information.
301
USES OF COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
Step 1: 
GPS satellites orbit Earth. Every 
thousandth of a second, each 
satellite sends a signal that 
indicates its current 
position to the GPS 
receiver. 
Step 2:
A GPS receiver (such as in a car, a wearable device, a smart phone, a handheld device, or a collar) determines
its location on Earth by analyzing at least 3 separate satellite signals from the 24 satellites in orbit.

Collaboration
Many software products provide a means to collaborate, or work online, with other users 
connected to a server. Two methods of collaboration include collaborative software and document
management systems. Collaborative software includes tools that enable users to share documents
via online meetings and communicate with other connected users. An online meeting allows users
to share documents with others in real time (Figure 8-6). When the online meeting takes place on 
the Web, it is called a Web conference. In an online meeting, all participants see a document(s) at the
same time. As someone changes the document,
everyone in the meeting sees the changes being
made. Collaborative software often has chat, white-
board, and video/audio conferencing capabilities. 
Some companies use document management
systems to make collaboration possible among
employees. A document management 
system provides for storage and manage-
ment of a company’s documents, such as
word processing documents, presentations,
and spreadsheets. Users then access these
documents, depending on their needs. A
document management system can track 
all changes made to a document. It also can
store additional information such as the docu-
ment’s creation date, the user who created the 
document, a summary of the document, and any
keywords associated with the document. Google
Docs is a Web-based document management
system that provides basic services to its
subscribers at no cost.
Groupware
Groupware is software that helps groups of people work together on projects and share
information over a network. Groupware is a component of a broad concept called workgroup
computing, which includes network hardware and software that enables group members to
communicate, manage projects, schedule meetings, and make group decisions. To assist with these
activities, most groupware provides personal information manager (PIM) functions, such as an elec-
tronic appointment calendar, an address book, and a notepad. A major feature of groupware is group
scheduling, in which a group calendar can track the schedules of multiple users and help coordinate
appointments and meeting times.
Voice Mail
Voice mail, which functions much like an answering machine, allows someone to leave a voice
message for one or more people. Unlike answering machines, however, a computer in the voice
mail system converts an analog voice message into digital form. Once digitized, the message is
stored in a voice mailbox. A voice mailbox is a storage location on a hard disk in the voice mail
system. Some voice mail systems can send digital voice mail files to e-mail addresses. Others can
convert a voice mail message to a text message for display on a computer or mobile device.
Web Services
Web services describe standardized software that enables programmers to create applications that
communicate with other remote computers over the Internet or over an internal business network.
Businesses are the primary users of Web services because this technology provides a means for
departments to communicate with each other, suppliers, vendors, and with clients. For example,
third-party vendors can use Web services to communicate with their online retailer’s Web site to
manage their inventory levels.

NETWORKS
As discussed in Chapter 1, a network is a collection of computers and devices connected together
via communications devices and transmission media. Many businesses network their computers
together to facilitate communications, share hardware, share data and information, share software,
and transfer funds.
A network can be internal to an organization or span the world by connecting to the Internet.
Instead of using the Internet or an internal network, some companies hire a value-added network
provider for network functions. A value-added network (VAN) is a third-party business that 
provides networking services for a fee. 
Networks facilitate communications among users and allow users to share resources with other
users. Some examples of resources are data, information, hardware, and software.  
LANs, MANs, and WANs
Networks usually are classified as a local area network, metropolitan area network, or wide
area network. The main differentiation among these classifications is their area of coverage, as
described in the following paragraphs.
LAN
A local area network
(LAN) is a network that connects
computers and devices in a 
limited geographical area such as
a home, school computer labora-
tory, office building, or closely
positioned group of buildings.
Each computer or device on the
network, called a node, often
shares resources such as printers,
large hard disks, and programs.
Often, the nodes are connected via
cables. A wireless LAN (WLAN)
is a LAN that uses no physical
wires. Very often, a WLAN com-
municates with a wired LAN for
access to its resources (Figure 8-7).
FIGURE 8-7

devices on a wireless LAN often communicate via an

MAN
A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a high-speed network that connects local area
networks in a metropolitan area such as a city or town and handles the bulk of communications
activity across that region. A MAN typically includes one or more LANs, but covers a smaller
geographic area than a WAN. 
A MAN usually is managed by a consortium of users or by a single network provider that
sells the service to the users. Local and state governments, for example, regulate some MANs.
Telephone companies, cable television operators, and other organizations provide users with 
connections to the MAN.
WAN
A wide area network (WAN) is a network that covers a large geographic area (such as a
city, country, or the world) using a communications channel that combines many types of media
such as telephone lines, cables, and radio waves (Figure 8-8). A WAN can be one large network or
can consist of two or more LANs connected together. The Internet is the world’s largest WAN.

Network Architectures
The design of computers, devices, and media in a network, sometimes called the network 
architecture, is categorized as either client/server or peer-to-peer. 
CLIENT/SERVER
On a client/server
network, one or more computers act as a
server; the other computers on the network
request services from the server (Figure 8-9).
A server controls access to the hardware,
software, and other resources on the net-
work and provides a centralized storage area
for programs, data, and information. The
clients are other computers and mobile
devices on the network that rely on the
server for its resources. For example, a
server might store a database of customers.
Clients on the network (company employ-
ees) access the customer database on the
server.
Some servers, called dedicated servers,
perform a specific task and can be placed
with other dedicated servers to perform
multiple tasks. For example, a file server
stores and manages files. A print server
manages printers and documents being
printed. A database server stores and 
provides access to a database. A network
server manages network traffic (activity).
A client/server network typically provides
an efficient means to connect 10 or more com-
puters. Most client/server networks require a
person to serve as a network administrator
because of the large size of the network.
PEER-TO-PEER
One type of peer-to-peer
network is a simple, inexpensive network
that typically connects fewer than 10 com-
puters. Each computer, called a peer, has
equal responsibilities and capabilities, shar-
ing hardware (such as a printer), data, or
information with other computers on the
peer-to-peer network (Figure 8-10). Each
computer stores files on its own storage
devices. Thus, each computer on the network
contains both the network operating system
and application software. All computers on
the network share any peripheral device(s)
attached to any computer. For example, one
computer may have a laser printer and a
scanner, while another has an ink-jet printer
and an external hard disk. Peer-to-peer net-
works are ideal for very small businesses and
home users. 
FIGURE 8-10
Each computer on a peer-to-peer network shares
its hardware and software with other computers on the network.

computers act as a server, and the clients access the server(s).

INTERNET PEER-TO-PEER
Another type of peer-to-peer, called P2P, describes an Internet network,
on which users access each other’s hard disks and exchange files directly (Figure 8-11). This type of
peer-to-peer network sometimes is called a file sharing network because users with compatible soft-
ware and an Internet connection copy files from someone else’s hard disk to their hard disks. As
more users connect to the network, each user has access to shared files on other users’ hard disks.
When users log off, others no longer have access to their hard disks. 
Examples of networking software that support P2P are BitTorrent, Gnutella, Kazaa, and LimeWire
which allow users to swap music and other files via the Web.
Network Topologies
A network topology refers to the layout of
the computers and devices in a communica-
tions network. Three commonly used network
topologies are bus, ring, and star. Networks
usually use combinations of these topologies. 
BUS NETWORK
A bus network consists of a
single central cable, to which all computers and
other devices connect (Figure 8-12). The bus is
the physical cable that connects the computers
and other devices. The bus in a bus network
transmits data, instructions, and information in
both directions. When a sending device trans-
mits data, the address of the receiving device is
included with the transmission so that the data
is routed to the appropriate receiving device.
Bus networks are popular on LANs because
they are inexpensive and easy to install. One
advantage of the bus network is that comput-
ers and other devices can be attached and
detached at any point on the bus without dis-
turbing the rest of the network. Another
advantage is that failure of one device usually
does not affect the rest of the bus network. The
greatest risk to a bus network is that the bus
itself might become inoperable. If that hap-
pens, the network remains inoperative until
the bus is back in working order.

RING NETWORK
On a ring network, a cable forms a
closed loop (ring) with all computers and devices arranged
along the ring (Figure 8-13). Data transmitted on a ring net-
work travels from device to device around the entire ring,
in one direction. When a computer or device sends data,
the data travels to each computer on the ring until it
reaches its destination.
If a computer or device on a ring network fails, all
devices before the failed device are unaffected, but those
after the failed device cannot function. A ring network can
span a larger distance than a bus network, but it is more
difficult to install. The ring topology primarily is used for
LANs, but also is used in WANs.
STAR NETWORK
On a star network, all of the computers
and devices (nodes) on the network connect to a central
device, thus forming a star (Figure 8-14). Two types of
devices that provide a common central connection point for
nodes on the network are a hub and a switch. All data that
transfers from one node to another passes through the
hub/switch.
Star networks are fairly easy to install and maintain.
Nodes can be added to and removed from the network
with little or no disruption to the network.
On a star network, if one node fails, only that node is
affected. The other nodes continue to operate normally. 
If the hub/switch fails, however, the entire network is 
inoperable until the device is repaired.
Intranets
Recognizing the efficiency and power of the Internet,
many organizations apply Internet and Web technologies
to their own internal networks. An intranet (intra means
within) is an internal network that uses Internet technolo-
gies. Intranets generally make company information 
accessible to employees and facilitate working in groups. 
Simple intranet applications include electronic publishing
of organizational materials such as telephone directories,
event calendars, procedure manuals, employee benefits
information, and job postings. Additionally, an intranet 
typically includes a connection to the Internet. More sophis-
ticated uses of intranets include groupware applications
such as project management, chat rooms, newsgroups,
group scheduling, and video conferencing.
An intranet essentially is a small version of the Internet
that exists within an organization. Users update informa-
tion on the intranet by creating and posting a Web page,
using a method similar to that used on the Internet.
Sometimes a company uses an extranet, which allows 
customers or suppliers to access part of its intranet. Package
shipping companies, for example, allow customers to access
their intranet to print air bills, schedule pickups, and even
track shipped packages as the packages travel to their 
destinations.

Network Communications Standards
Today’s networks connect terminals, devices, and computers from many different manufacturers
across many types of networks, such as wide area, local area, and wireless. For the different devices
on various types of networks to be able to communicate, the network must use similar techniques of
moving data through the network from one application to another.
To alleviate the problems of incompatibility and ensure that hardware and software components can
be integrated into any network, various organizations such as ANSI and IEEE (pronounced I triple E)
propose, develop, and approve network standards. A network standard defines guidelines that specify
the way computers access the medium to which they are attached, the type(s) of medium used, the
speeds used on different types of networks, and the type(s) of physical cable and/or the wireless tech-
nology used. A standard that outlines characteristics of how two network devices communicate is
called a protocol. Hardware and software manufacturers design their products to meet the guidelines
specified in a particular standard, so that their devices can communicate with the network.
The following sections discuss some of the more widely used network communications standards
for both wired and wireless networks including Ethernet, token ring, TCP/IP, 802.11 (Wi-Fi),
Bluetooth, UWB, IrDA, RFID, WiMAX, and WAP.
ETHERNET
Ethernet is a network standard that specifies no central computer or device on the 
network (nodes) should control when data can be transmitted; that is, each node attempts to trans-
mit data when it determines the network is able to receive communications. If two computers on
an Ethernet network attempt to send data at the same time, a collision occurs, and the computers
must attempt to send their messages again.
Ethernet is based on a bus topology, but Ethernet networks can be wired in a star pattern. The
Ethernet standard defines guidelines for the physical configuration of the network, e.g., cabling, 
network cards, and nodes. Today, Ethernet is the most popular LAN standard because it is relatively
inexpensive and easy to install and maintain. Ethernet networks often use cables to transmit data.
TOKEN RING
The token ring standard specifies that computers and devices on the network share 
or pass a special signal, called a token, in a unidirectional manner and in a preset order. A token is a
special series of bits that function like a ticket. The device with the token can transmit data over the
network. Only one token exists per network. This ensures that only one computer transmits data at a
time. Token ring is based on a ring topology (although it can use a star topology). The token ring
standard defines guidelines for the physical configuration of a network. Some token ring networks
connect up to 72 devices. Others use a special type of wiring that allows up to 260 connections. 
TCP/IP
Short for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, TCP/IP is a network standard,
specifically a protocol, that defines how messages (data) are routed from one end of a network to the
other. TCP/IP describes rules for dividing messages into small pieces, called packets; providing
addresses for each packet; checking for and detecting errors; sequencing packets; and regulating the
flow of messages along the network.
TCP/IP has been adopted as a network standard for Internet communications. Thus, all hosts on the
Internet follow the rules defined in this standard. Internet communications also use other standards,
such as the Ethernet standard, as data is routed to its destination.
When a computer sends data over the Internet, the data is divided into packets. Each packet contains
the data, as well as the recipient (destination), the origin (sender), and the sequence information used to
reassemble the data at the destination. Each packet travels along the fastest individual available path to
the recipient’s computer via communications devices called routers.
802.11 (WI-FI)
Developed by IEEE, 802.11 also known as Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) and wireless
Ethernet, is a series of network standards that specifies how two wireless devices communicate over
the air with each other. Using Wi-Fi, computers or devices that have the appropriate wireless capa-
bility communicate via radio waves with other computers or devices. The Wi-Fi standard uses tech-
niques similar to the Ethernet standard to specify how physically to configure a wireless network.
Most of today’s computers and many personal mobile devices, such as smart phones and handheld
game consoles, are Wi-Fi enabled.

One popular use of the Wi-Fi standard is in hot spots that offer mobile users the ability to connect
to the Internet with their Wi-Fi enabled wireless computers and devices. Many homes and small
businesses also use Wi-Fi to network computers and devices together wirelessly.
BLUETOOTH
Bluetooth is a standard, specifically a protocol, that defines how two Bluetooth devices
use short-range radio waves to transmit data. To communicate with each other, Bluetooth devices often
must be within about 10 meters (about 33 feet) but can be extended to 100 meters with additional equip-
ment. Examples of Bluetooth devices can include desktop computers, notebook computers, handheld
computers, smart phones, PDAs, headsets, microphones, digital cameras, and printers.
UWB
UWB, which stands for ultra-wideband, is a network standard that specifies how two UWB
devices use short-range radio waves to communicate at high speeds with each other. For optimal com-
munications, the devices should be within 2 to 10 meters (about 6.5 to 33 feet) of each other. Examples of
UWB uses include wirelessly transferring video from a digital video camera, printing pictures from a
digital camera, downloading media to a portable media player, or displaying a slide show on a projector.
IRDA
Some computers and devices use the IrDA specification to transmit data wirelessly to each
other via infrared (IR) light waves. Infrared requires a line-of-sight transmission; that is, the sending
device and the receiving device must be in line with each other so that nothing obstructs the path of
the infrared light wave.
RFID
RFID (radio frequency identification) is a standard, specifically a protocol, that defines how 
a network uses radio signals to communicate with a tag placed in or attached to an object, an animal,
or a person. The tag consists of an antenna and a memory chip that contains the information to be
transmitted via radio waves. Through an antenna, an RFID reader reads the radio signals and trans-
fers the information to a computer or computing device. Readers can be handheld or embedded in 
an object such as a doorway or tollbooth.
WIMAX
WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), also known as 802.16, is a
newer network standard developed by IEEE that specifies how wireless devices communicate over the
air in a wide area. Using the WiMAX standard,
computers or devices with the appropriate
WiMAX wireless capability communicate via
radio waves with other computers or devices
via a WiMAX tower. The WiMAX tower, which
can cover up to a 30-mile radius, connects to the
Internet or to another WiMAX tower. Read
Ethics & Issues 8-2 for a discussion related to
wireless antennas and towers.
Two types of WiMAX specifications are fixed
wireless and mobile wireless. With fixed wire-
less WiMAX, a customer accesses the Internet
from a desktop computer at home or other
permanent location. Mobile wireless WiMAX,
by contrast, enables users to access the
WiMAX network with mobile computers and
mobile devices such as smart phones. 
The WiMAX standard provides wireless
broadband Internet access at a reasonable cost
over long distances to business and home users.
The WiMAX standard, similar to the Wi-Fi stan-
dard, connects mobile users to the Internet via
hot spots. The next generation of game consoles
also plans to support the WiMAX standard.

Should You Worry about Cell Phone and Cellular
Antenna Radiation?
Well over two billion people use cell phones, and more than 80 percent of the
world’s population has access to cell phone service from cellular antennas.
These numbers are expected to rise sharply in coming years, and many are
concerned about potential health effects from cell phones and cellular antennas.
Some cell phone users who suffered rare illnesses have filed lawsuits against cell
phone companies, but the cases usually are lost due to lack of scientific evidence
linking the use of the phones to the illnesses. While debates rage in communities
over placement of cellular antennas, the consideration of health effects on resi-
dents is muted because the federal government’s Telecommunications Act of
1996 prohibits local governments from considering health effects when making
decisions about antenna placement. As cellular providers begin offering faster
Internet services, they estimate that they may need to more than double the
current number of antennas in the United States. It generally is agreed that no
studies conclusively demonstrate negative health effects from cell phones and
cellular antennas, but skeptics claim that digital cellular technology is too new to
have endured long-term studies on humans. Long-term studies that are under-
way may not provide results for decades. Are you concerned about cell phone
and cellular antenna radiation? Why or why not? Do you or anyone you know
minimize use of cell phones due to health concerns? Should more studies be
done on potential health effects, and if so, who should pay for the studies? 
Why? Would you live next to a cellular antenna? Why or why not?

WAP
The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a standard, specifically a protocol, that 
specifies how some mobile devices such as smart phones can display the content of Internet 
services such as the Web, e-mail, and chat rooms. For example, users can check weather, sports
scores, and headline news from their WAP-enabled smart phone. To display a Web page on 
a smart phone, the phone should contain a microbrowser. WAP uses a client/server network. The
wireless device contains the client software, which connects to the Internet access provider’s server.
COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE
Communications software consists of programs that (1) help users establish a connection to
another computer or network; (2) manage the transmission of data, instructions, and information;
and (3) provide an interface for users to communicate with one another. The first two are system
software and the third is application software. Chapter 3 presented a variety of examples of appli-
cation software for communications: e-mail, FTP, Web browser, newsgroup/message boards, chat
rooms, instant messaging, video conferencing, and VoIP.
Some communications devices are preprogrammed to accomplish communications tasks. Other
communications devices require separate communications software to ensure proper transmission
of data. Communications software works with the network standards and protocols defined earlier
to ensure data moves correctly through a network. Communications software usually is bundled
with the operating system or purchased network devices.
Often, a computer has various types of communications software, each serving a different purpose.
One type of communications software helps users establish a connection to the Internet using wizards,
dialog boxes, and other on-screen messages. Communications software also allows home and small
office users to configure wired and wireless networks and connect devices to an existing network.
COMMUNICATIONS OVER THE TELEPHONE NETWORK
The public switched telephone network (PSTN) is the worldwide telephone system that handles
voice-oriented telephone calls (Figure 8-15). Nearly the entire telephone network today uses
digital technology, with the exception of the final link from the local telephone company to a
home, which often is analog.

The telephone network is an integral part of computer communications. Data, instructions, and
information are transmitted over the telephone network using dial-up lines or dedicated lines. The
following sections discuss dial-up lines and the various types of dedicated lines that use the telephone
network for data communications.
Dial-Up Lines
A dial-up line is a temporary connection that uses one or more analog telephone lines for
communications. A dial-up connection is not permanent. Using a dial-up line to transmit data is
similar to using the telephone to make a call. A modem at the sending end dials the telephone
number of a modem at the receiving end. When the modem at the receiving end answers the 
call, a connection is established and data can be transmitted. When either modem hangs up, the
communications end. 
Using a dial-up line to connect computers costs no more than making a regular telephone call.
Computers at any two locations establish an Internet or network connection using modems and the
telephone network. 
Dedicated Lines
A dedicated line is a type of always-on connection that is established between two communications
devices (unlike a dial-up line where the connection is reestablished each time it is used). The quality and
consistency of the connection on a dedicated line are better than a dial-up line because dedicated lines
provide a constant connection.
Businesses often use dedicated lines to connect geographically distant offices. Dedicated lines can be
either analog or digital. Digital lines increasingly are connecting home and business users to networks
around the globe because they transmit data and information at faster rates than analog lines.
Five types of digital dedicated lines are ISDN lines, DSL, FTTP, T-carrier lines, and ATM. Although
cable television (CATV) lines and fixed wireless are not a type of stan-
dard telephone line, they are very popular ways for the home user to
connect to the Internet. Fixed wireless Internet connections use an
antenna on your house or business to communicate with a tower loca-
tion via radio signals. Later sections in this chapter discuss the use of
CATV lines and radio signals to connect to the Internet.
The table in Figure 8-16 lists the approximate monthly costs of
various types of Internet connections and transfer rates (speeds), as
compared with dial-up lines. The following sections discuss ISDN
lines, DSL, FTTP, T-carrier lines, and ATM.
ISDN LINES
For the small business and home user, an ISDN line
provides faster transfer rates than dial-up telephone lines. Not as
widely used today as in the past, ISDN (Integrated Services Digital
Network) is a set of standards for digital transmission of data over
standard copper telephone lines. ISDN requires that both ends of the
connection have an ISDN modem. The ISDN modem at your loca-
tion must be within about 3.5 miles of the telephone company’s
ISDN modem. Thus, ISDN may not be an option for rural residents.
DSL
DSL is a popular digital line alternative for the small business
or home user. DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) transmits at fast speeds
on existing standard copper telephone wiring. Some DSL installa-
tions include a dial tone, providing users with both voice and data
communications.
To connect to DSL, a customer must have a special network card
and a DSL modem. Not all areas offer DSL service because the local
telephone company or the lines in the area may not be capable of
supporting DSL technology. As with ISDN, DSL may not be an

option for rural residents because the user’s location (and DSL modem) and the telephone
company’s DSL modem must be located within about 3.5 miles of each other. 
ADSL is one of the more popular types of DSLs. ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) is a 
type of DSL that supports faster transfer rates when receiving data (the downstream rate) than when
sending data (the upstream rate). ADSL is ideal for Internet access because most users download 
more information from the Internet than they upload.
FTTP
FTTP, which stands for Fiber to the Premises, uses fiber-optic cable to provide extremely
high-speed Internet access to a user's physical permanent location. Two specific types of FTTP are
FTTH (Fiber to the Home) and FTTB (Fiber to the Building). With FTTP service, an optical terminal
at your premises receives the signals and transfers them to a router connected to your computer. 
As the cost of installing fiber decreases, increasingly more homes and businesses will opt for this
high-speed Internet access.
T-CARRIER LINES
A T-carrier line is any of several types of long-distance digital telephone lines
that carry multiple signals over a single communications line. T-carrier lines provide very fast data
transfer rates. Only medium to large companies usually can afford the investment in T-carrier lines
because these lines are so expensive.
The most popular T-carrier line is the T1 line. Businesses often use T1 lines to connect to the
Internet. Many Internet access providers use T1 lines to connect to the Internet backbone. Home
and small business users purchase fractional T1, in which they share a connection to the T1 line
with other users. Fractional T1 is slower than a dedicated T1 line, but it also is less expensive. 
A T3 line is equal in speed to 28 T1 lines. T3 lines are quite expensive. Main users of T3 lines
include large companies, telephone companies, and Internet access providers connecting to the
Internet backbone. The Internet backbone itself also uses T3 lines.
ATM
ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is a service that carries voice, data, video, and 
multimedia at extremely high speeds. Telephone networks, the Internet, and other networks with
large amounts of traffic use ATM. Some experts predict that ATM eventually will become the 
Internet standard for data transmission, replacing T3 lines.

COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES
A communications device is any type of hardware capable of transmitting data, instructions, 
and information between a sending device and a receiving device. One type of communications
device that connects a communications channel to a sending or receiving device such as a com-
puter is a modem. Computers process data as digital signals. Data, instructions, and information
travel along a communications channel in either analog or digital form, depending on the com-
munications channel. An analog signal consists of a continuous electrical wave. A digital signal
consists of individual electrical pulses that represent bits grouped together into bytes.

For communications channels that use digital signals (such as cable television lines), the modem
transfers the digital signals between the computer and the communications channel (Figure 8-17a). 
If a communications channel uses analog signals (such as some telephone lines), however, the
modem first converts between analog and digital signals (Figure 8-17b).
The following pages describe the following types of communications devices: dial-up modems, ISDN
and DSL modems, cable modems, wireless modems, network cards, wireless access points, and routers.
313
COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES
FIGURE 8-17
A modem connects a communications channel, such as a cable television line or a telephone line, to a sending or
receiving device, such as a computer. Depending on the type of communications channel, a modem may need to convert digital signals
to analog signals (and vice versa) before transferring data, instructions, and information to or from a sending or receiving device.
Dial-Up Modems
As previously discussed, a computer’s digital signals must be converted to analog signals before
they are transmitted over standard telephone lines. The communications device that performs this
conversion is a modem, sometimes called a dial-up modem. The word, modem, is derived from the
combination of the words, modulate, to change into an analog signal, and demodulate, to convert an
analog signal into a digital signal. 
A modem usually is in the form of an adapter card that you insert in an expansion slot on a com-
puter’s motherboard. One end of a standard telephone cord attaches to a port on the modem card
and the other end plugs into a telephone outlet.

Wireless Modems
Some mobile users have a
wireless modem that uses the 
cell phone network to connect 
to the Internet wirelessly from 
a notebook computer, a smart
phone, or other mobile device
(Figure 8-19). Wireless modems,
which have an external or built-in
antenna, are available as PC Cards,
ExpressCard modules, and flash
cards.

ISDN and DSL Modems
If you access the Internet using ISDN or DSL, you need a communications device to send and
receive the digital ISDN or DSL signals. An ISDN modem sends digital data and information from
a computer to an ISDN line and receives digital data and information from an ISDN line. A DSL
modem sends digital data and information from a computer to a DSL line and receives digital data
and information from a DSL line. ISDN and DSL modems usually are external devices, in which
one end connects to the telephone line and the other end connects to a port on the system unit.
Cable Modems
A cable modem is a digital modem that sends and receives digital data over the cable television
(CATV) network (Figure 8-18). With more than 110 million homes wired for cable television, cable
modems provide a faster Internet access alternative to dial-up for the home user and have speeds
similar to DSL. Cable modems currently can transmit data at speeds that are much faster than
either a dial-up modem or ISDN.

Each has its own advantages. DSL uses a line 
that is not shared with other users in the neigh-

users share the node with up to hundreds of
other cable Internet users. Simultaneous access
by many users can cause the cable Internet serv-
ice to slow down. Cable Internet service, however,
has widespread availability. For more information,

Network Cards
A network card is an adapter card, PC Card, ExpressCard module, USB network adapter, or
flash card that enables a computer or device that does not have networking capability to access a
network. The network card coordinates the transmission and receipt of data, instructions, and
information to and from the computer or device containing the network card.
Network cards are available in a variety of styles (Figure 8-20). A network card for a desktop
computer is an adapter card that has a port to which a cable connects. A network card for mobile
computers and devices is in the form of a PC Card, ExpressCard module, USB network adapter,
or a flash card. Network cards that provide wireless data transmission also are available. This
type of card, sometimes called a wireless network card, often has an antenna.
A network card follows the guidelines of a particular network communications standard, such
as Ethernet or token ring. An Ethernet card is the most common type of network card.

Wireless Access Points
A wireless access point is a central
communications device that allows com-
puters and devices to transfer data wirelessly
among themselves or to transfer data wire-
lessly to a wired network (Figure 8-7 on page
303). Wireless access points have high-quality
antennas for optimal signals. 
Routers
A router is a communications device that
connects multiple computers or other routers
together and transmits data to its correct desti-
nation on the network. A router can be used
on any size of network. On the largest scale,
routers along the Internet backbone forward
data packets to their destination using the
fastest available path. For smaller business
and home networks, a router allows multiple
computers to share a single high-speed
Internet connection such as a cable modem 
or DSL modem (Figure 8-21). These routers
connect from 2 to 250 computers.

To prevent unauthorized users from accessing files and computers, many routers are protected by 
a built-in firewall, called a hardware firewall. Some also have built-in antivirus protection. Today’s
routers or combination wireless access point/routers are easy to configure and secure against
unauthorized access.
HOME NETWORKS
Many home users are connecting multiple computers and devices together in a home network. Each
networked computer in the house has the following capabilities:
• Connect to the Internet at the same time
• Share a single high-speed Internet connection
• Access files and programs on the other computers in the house
• Share peripherals such as a printer, scanner, external hard disk, or DVD drive
• Play multiplayer games with players on other computers in the house
• Connect game consoles to the Internet
• Subscribe to and use VoIP
Many vendors offer home networking packages that include all the necessary hardware and 
software to network your home using wired or wireless techniques. Some of these packages also
offer intelligent networking capabilities. An intelligent home network extends the basic home 
network to include features such as lighting control, thermostat adjustment, and a security system.
Wired Home Networks
As with other networks, a home network can use wires, be wireless, or use a combination of wired
and wireless. Three types of wired home networks are Ethernet, powerline cable, and phoneline.
ETHERNET
Some home users have an Ethernet network. As discussed earlier in this chapter, 
traditional Ethernet networks require that each computer have built-in networking capabilities or
contain a network card, which connects to a central network hub or similar device with a physical
cable. This may involve running cable through walls, ceilings, and floors in the house. For the 
average home user, the hardware and software of an Ethernet network can be difficult to configure.
POWERLINE CABLE NETWORK
A home powerline cable network is a network that uses the same
lines that bring electricity into the house. This network requires no additional wiring. One end of a
cable plugs in the computer’s parallel or USB port and the other end of the cable plugs in a wall
outlet. The data transmits through the existing power lines in the house.
PHONELINE NETWORK
A phoneline network is an easy-to-install and inexpensive network that uses
existing telephone lines in the home. With this network, one end of a cable connects to an adapter
card or PC Card in the computer and the other end plugs in a wall telephone jack. The phoneline net-
work does not interfere with voice and data transmissions on the telephone lines. That is, you can
talk on the telephone and use the same line to connect to the Internet.
Wireless Home Networks
To network computers and devices that span multiple rooms or floors in a home, it may be more
convenient to use a wireless strategy. One advantage of wireless networks is that you can take a
mobile computer outside, for example in the backyard, and connect to the Internet through the home
network as long as you are in the network’s range. 
Most home networks use a Wi-Fi network, which sends signals through the air at distances of up 
to 1,500 feet in some configurations. Home users set up Wi-Fi networks in their homes because Wi-Fi 
networks are fairly easy to configure. Each computer that accesses the network must have the appro-
priate built-in wireless networking capabilities or a wireless network card, which communicates with
a wireless access point or a combination router/wireless access point (Figure 8-22).

COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL
As described at the beginning of the chapter, a communications channel is the transmission
media on which data, instructions, or information travel in a communications system. The
amount of data, instructions, and information that can travel over a communications channel
sometimes is called the bandwidth. The higher the bandwidth, the more the channel transmits.
For example, a cable modem has more bandwidth than a dial-up modem.
For transmission of text only, a lower bandwidth is acceptable. For transmission of music,
graphics, photos, virtual reality images, or 3-D games, however, you need a higher bandwidth.
When the bandwidth is too low for the application, you will notice a considerable slow-down 
in system performance.
A communications channel consists of one or more transmission media. Transmission media
consist of materials or substances capable of carrying one or more signals. When you send data
from a computer, the signal that carries the data may travel over various transmission media.
This is especially true when the transmission spans a long distance.

Figure 8-23 illustrates a typical communications channel and shows the variety of transmission
media used to complete the connection.
Baseband media transmit only one signal at a time. By contrast, broadband media transmit
multiple signals simultaneously. Broadband media transmit signals at a much faster speed than
baseband media. Home and business users today opt for broadband Internet access because of
the much faster transfer rates. Two previously discussed services that offer broadband transmis-
sion are DSL and the cable television Internet service. Satellites also offer broadband transmission.
Read Looking Ahead 8-1 for a look at the future of communications.
Transmission media are one of two types: physical or wireless. Physical transmission media use
wire, cable, and other tangible materials to send communications signals. Wireless transmission
media send communications signals through the air or space using radio, microwave, and infrared
signals. The following sections discuss these types of media.

Technology Curbs Impaired Drivers
In an effort to stop impaired drivers from getting behind the wheel, Nissan has installed
three prototype features designed to detect a person’s level of sobriety in a concept car.
A sensor in the transmission shift knob detects alcohol escaping the body through
perspiration. Three other sensors in the driver’s and passengers’ seats detect alcohol in
the cabin air. If the alcohol level exceeds a predetermined threshold, the transmission 
is locked and the car’s navigation system issues a voice alert and displays a warning
message.
Another feature uses a camera mounted on the dashboard to monitor eye blinking.
When drowsiness is detected, the driver’s seat belt tightens and voice and visual alerts
activate in efforts to encourage the driver to pull off the road and rest. A third feature
senses when the car is weaving in the driving lane and consequently issues visual and auditory alerts along with
tugs on the seat belt. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch8/looking and then click Sobriety Technology.
PHYSICAL TRANSMISSION MEDIA
Physical transmission media used in communications include twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable, 
and fiber-optic cable. These cables typically are used within or underground between buildings.
Ethernet and token ring LANs often use physical transmission media. 
Twisted-Pair Cable
One of the more commonly
used transmission media for
network cabling and telephone
systems is twisted-pair cable.
Twisted-pair cable consists of 
one or more twisted-pair wires
bundled together (Figure 8-24).
Each twisted-pair wire consists 
of two separate insulated copper
wires that are twisted together.
The wires are twisted together to
reduce noise. Noise is an electri-
cal disturbance that can degrade
communications.

• Capability of carrying significantly more 
signals than wire cables
• Faster data transmission
• Less susceptible to noise (interference) 
from other devices such as a copy machine
• Better security for signals during 
transmission because they are less 
susceptible to noise
• Smaller size (much thinner and lighter
weight)
Disadvantages of fiber-optic cable are it 
costs more than twisted-pair or coaxial cable
and can be difficult to install and modify.
Despite these limitations, many local and long-
distance telephone companies are replacing
existing telephone lines with fiber-optic cables,
enabling them to offer fiber Internet access to
home and business users. 
Coaxial Cable
Coaxial cable, often referred to as coax (pronounced KO-ax), consists of a single copper wire
surrounded by at least three layers: (1) an insulating material, (2) a woven or braided metal, and
(3) a plastic outer coating (Figure 8-25).
Cable television (CATV) network wiring often
uses coaxial cable because it can be cabled over
longer distances than twisted-pair cable. Most of
today’s computer networks, however, do not use
coaxial cable because other transmission media
such as fiber-optic cable transmit signals at faster
rates.
Fiber-Optic Cable
The core of a fiber-optic cable consists of
dozens or hundreds of thin strands of glass or
plastic that use light to transmit signals. Each
strand, called an optical fiber, is as thin as a
human hair. Inside the fiber-optic cable, an insu-
lating glass cladding and a protective coating
surround each optical fiber (Figure 8-26).
Fiber-optic cables have the following 
advantages over cables that use wire, such 
as twisted-pair and coaxial cables:

WIRELESS TRANSMISSION MEDIA
Many users opt for wireless transmission media because it is more convenient than installing
cables. In addition, businesses use wireless transmission media in locations where it is impossible
to install cables. Types of wireless transmission media used in communications include infrared,
broadcast radio, cellular radio, microwaves, and communications satellites. 
C6672_CH08_pp3  1/30/08  2:23 PM  Page 320

Infrared
As discussed earlier in the chapter, infrared (IR) is a wireless transmission medium that sends 
signals using infrared light waves. Mobile computers and devices, such as a mouse, printer, and
smart phone, often have an IrDA port that enables the transfer of data from one device to another
using infrared light waves.
Broadcast Radio
Broadcast radio is a wireless transmission medium that distributes radio signals through the 
air over long distances such as between cities, regions, and countries and short distances such 
as within an office or home. Bluetooth, UWB, Wi-Fi, and WiMAX communications technologies
discussed earlier in this chapter use broadcast radio signals.
Cellular Radio
Cellular radio is a form of broadcast radio that is used widely for mobile communications,
specifically wireless modems and cell phones. A cell phone is a telephone device that uses 
high-frequency radio waves to transmit voice and digital data messages. 
Some mobile users connect their notebook computer or other mobile computer to a cell phone
to access the Web, send and receive e-mail, enter a chat room, or connect to an office or school
network while away from a standard telephone line. Read Looking Ahead 8-2 for a look at the
next generation of cellular communications.
Personal Communications Services (PCS) is the term used by the United States Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) to identify all wireless digital communications. Devices 
that use PCS include cell phones, PDAs, pagers, and fax machines.

Femto Base Stations Enhance Cell Phone Signals
Your cell phone may work fine when you are in your backyard, but sometimes it barely can receive a signal when you 
walk into your house. This frustrating coverage problem may disappear when major communications companies, such
as Alcatel-Lucent and Sony, develop a femto base station that will increase the signal strength in an indoor residence.
The femto access point, also called a femtocell, will be approximately the size of a cable converter box and will 
function as a hot spot. A cell phone automatically will switch to this indoor base station when the user walks into 
the home. Consumers are expected to welcome this enhanced signal strength because one-half of cell phone calls
originate from inside a home.
Engineers claim the low-power femto signal causes no health concerns because it has only one percent of the 
transmitting strength of a Wi-Fi network. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch8/looking and then click
Femto Base Station.
Microwaves
Microwaves are radio waves that provide a high-speed signal transmission. Microwave 
transmission, often called fixed wireless, involves sending signals from one microwave station to
another (shown in Figure 8-1 on page 296). Microwaves can transmit data at rates up to 4,500
times faster than a dial-up modem.
A microwave station is an earth-based reflective dish that contains the antenna, transceivers,
and other equipment necessary for microwave communications. Microwaves use line-of-sight
transmission. To avoid possible obstructions, such as buildings or mountains, microwave stations
often sit on the tops of buildings, towers, or mountains.
Microwave transmission is used in environments where installing physical transmission media
is difficult or impossible and where line-of-sight transmission is available. For example, microwave
transmission is used in wide-open areas such as deserts or lakes; between buildings in a close geo-
graphic area; or to communicate with a satellite. Current users of microwave transmission include
universities, hospitals, city governments, cable television providers, and telephone companies.
Home and small business users who do not have other high-speed Internet connections available
in their area also opt for lower-cost fixed wireless plans.

Communications Satellite
A communications satellite is a space station that receives microwave signals from an earth-based station, amplifies
(strengthens) the signals, and broadcasts the signals back over a wide area to any number of earth-based stations (shown 
in Figure 8-1 on page 296).
These earth-based stations often are microwave stations. Other devices, such as smart phones and GPS receivers, also can
function as earth-based stations. Transmission from an earth-based station to a satellite is an uplink. Transmission from a
satellite to an earth-based station is a downlink.
Applications such as air navigation, television and radio broadcasts, weather forecasting, video conferencing, paging,
global positioning systems, and Internet connections use communications satellites. With the proper satellite dish and a sat-
ellite modem card, consumers access the Internet using satellite technology. With satellite Internet connections, however,
uplink transmissions usually are slower than downlink transmissions. This difference in speeds usually is acceptable to most
Internet satellite users because they download much more data than they upload. Although a satellite Internet connection is
more expensive than cable Internet or DSL connections, sometimes it is the only high-speed Internet option in remote areas.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter provided an overview of communications terminology and applications. It also discussed how to join 
computers into a network, allowing them to communicate and share resources such as hardware, software, data, and 
information. It also explained various types of communications devices, media, and procedures as they relate to computers.
Network Specialist
As more companies rely on networks, the demand for network specialists will continue to grow. A network 
specialist must have a working knowledge of local area networks and their application within wide area 
networks. A network specialist also must be familiar with the Internet, its connectivity to LANs and WANs, 
and Web server management. Responsibilities of a network specialist include installing, configuring, and 
troubleshooting network systems. Other responsibilities may include managing system and client software, 
Web page integration and creation, network security measures, user accounting, and monitoring network 
event logs for problem resolution. A network specialist must possess good problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently.
They also must have the ability to concentrate on detailed projects for long periods of time. Good oral, written, and team-oriented interper-
sonal skills also are beneficial.
Many institutions offer two-year network specialist programs. In addition to a college degree, industry certifications are available for 
further career enhancement. Two of the more notable certifications are the Novell CNA (Certified Novell Administrator) and the Cisco 
CCNA (Certified Cisco Networking Associate). Network specialist salaries will vary depending on education, certifications, and experience.
Individuals with certifications can expect an approximate starting salary between $55,000 and $95,000. For more information, visit

Chapter Review
The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students regarding
any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch8/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
What Components Are Required for Successful Communications?
Computer communications describes a process in which two or more computers or devices transfer data, instructions, and
information. Successful communications require a sending device that initiates a transmission instruction, a communications
device that connects the sending device to a communications channel, a communications channel on which the data travels, a
communications device that connects the communications channel to a receiving device, and a receiving device that accepts
the transmission.
How Are Computer Communications Used?
Communications technologies include the Internet, Web, e-mail, instant messaging, chat rooms, newsgroups, blogs, wikis,
RSS, VoIP, FTP, Web folders, video conferencing, and fax machine or computer fax/modem. People also use communica-
tions for other purposes. Users send and receive wireless messages to and from smart phones, cell phones, handheld game
consoles, and other personal mobile devices using text messaging, wireless instant messaging, picture messaging, and
video messaging. At home, work, school, and in many public locations, people connect wirelessly to the Internet through 
a wireless Internet access point, either a hot spot or a mobile wireless network. A cybercafé is a coffeehouse, restaurant, 
or other location that provides personal computers with Internet access. A global positioning system (GPS) analyzes 
signals sent by satellites to determine an earth-based receiver’s geographic location. Many software products allow users 
to collaborate, or work online, with other users connected to a server. A document management system provides for stor-
age and management of a company’s documents, such as word processing documents, presentations, and spreadsheets.
Groupware is software that helps people work together and share information over a network. Voice mail allows someone
to leave a voice message for one or more people.
What Are Different Types of Networks?
A network is a collection of computers and devices connected together via communications devices and media. Networks
usually are classified as a local area network, metropolitan area network, or wide area network. A local area network (LAN)
connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area or closely positioned group of buildings. A wireless LAN
(WLAN) is a LAN that uses no physical wires. A metropolitan area network (MAN) connects local area networks in a 
metropolitan area and handles the bulk of communications activity across that region. A wide area network (WAN) covers 
a large geographic area using a communications channel that combines many types of media.
What Is the Purpose of Communications Software?
Communications software helps users establish a connection to another computer or network, manages the transmission
of data, and provides an interface for users to communicate with one another.
What Are Various Types of Lines for Communications Over the Telephone Network?
The telephone network uses dial-up lines or dedicated lines. A dial-up line is a temporary connection that uses one or
more analog telephone lines for communications. A dedicated line is an always-on connection established between two
communications devices. Dedicated lines include ISDN lines, DSL, FTTP, T-carrier lines, and ATM. ISDN is a set of stan-
dards for digital transmission over standard copper telephone lines. DSL transmits at fast speeds on existing standard
copper telephone wiring. FTTP (Fiber to the Premises) uses fiber-optic cable to provide extremely high-speed Internet
access to a user’s physical permanent location. A T-carrier line is a long-distance digital telephone line that carries multi-
ple signals over a single communications line. ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is a service that carries voice, data,
video, and multimedia at extremely high speeds.

What Are Commonly Used Communications Devices?
A communications device is any hardware capable of transmitting data between a sending device and a receiving device. 
A modem converts a computer’s digital signals to analog signals for transmission over standard telephone lines. An ISDN
modem transmits digital data to and from an ISDN line, while a DSL modem transmits digital data to and from a DSL line. A
cable modem is a digital modem that sends and receives digital data over the cable television network. A wireless modem uses
the cell phone network to connect to the Internet wirelessly from a smart phone, a mobile computer, or mobile device. A network
card is an adapter card, PC Card, ExpressCard module, USB network adapter, or flash card that enables a computer or device
that does not have networking capability to access a network. A wireless access point allows computers and devices to transfer
data wirelessly. A router connects multiple computers together and transmits data to its correct destination on the network.
How Can a Home Network Be Set Up?
A home network connects multiple computers and devices in a home. An Ethernet network connects each computer to 
a central hub with a physical cable. A home powerline cable network uses the same lines that bring electricity into the
house. A phoneline network uses existing telephone lines in a home. Most home networks use a Wi-Fi network, which
sends signals through the air at distances of up to 1,500 feet in some configurations.
What Are Various Physical and Wireless Transmission Media?
Transmission media consist of materials or substances capable of carrying one or more signals. Physical transmission media
use tangible materials to send communications signals. Twisted-pair cable consists of one or more twisted-pair wires bundled
together. Coaxial cable consists of a single copper wire surrounded by at least three layers: an insulating material, a woven or
braided metal, and a plastic outer coating. Fiber-optic cable consists of thin strands of glass or plastic that use light to transmit
signals. Wireless transmission media send communications signals through the air or space. Infrared (IR) sends signals using
infrared light waves. Broadcast radio distributes radio signals through the air over long and short distances. Cellular radio is 
a form of broadcast radio that is used widely for mobile communications. Microwaves are radio waves that provide a high-
speed signal transmission. A communications satellite is a space station that receives microwave signals from an earth-based
station, amplifies the signals, and broadcasts the signals back over a wide area.

LEARN HOW TO 1: Set Up and Install a Wi-Fi Home Network
In this chapter you learned about home networks and their advantages (see page 316, Home Networks). Creating a 
Wi-Fi home network consists of four phases: 1) subscribe to a high-speed Internet access provider; 2) purchase the Wi-Fi
equipment; 3) connect the physical devices; and 4) create the network through the use of software.
SUBSCRIBE TO A HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS PROVIDER
A high-speed Internet access provider is advisable to connect
all computers on the home network to the Internet. The three primary ways for home users to obtain a fast connection to
the Internet are DSL, cable, and satellite. DSL is provided by telephone companies, cable is provided by cable TV com-
panies, and satellite connections are provided by satellite TV providers. Each has its advantages and disadvantages,
including the minimum and maximum speed of Internet access, cost, and availability.
Determining the optimal high-speed Internet access provider depends largely on where the network will be located,
local costs, and service availability. The way to obtain the best high-speed Internet access provider is to research the
options available in your area.
Exercise
1. Assume you live near Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. You have decided that a high-speed Internet access provider and a Wi-Fi
network would be advantageous for your at-home business. Find answers to the following questions for this Idaho
town or a town specified by your instructor: What high-speed Internet access providers are available? Which pro-
vides the best service? Which is the cheapest? Based on the information you gather, write a plan for subscribing to a
high-speed Internet access provider. Submit the answers to the questions and your plan to your instructor.
PURCHASE THE WI-FI EQUIPMENT As part of the service when you subscribe to a high-speed Internet access provider, you
receive a modem that is capable of connecting to the Internet. In most cases, the modem is not a wireless transmitter. So,
in order to establish a wireless connection between the Internet and the home network, you will need a wireless router
that establishes the wireless access point.
You can visit any retail electronics store and find a wide variety of wireless routers. A key to purchasing the correct
router is to ensure it will work with your modem and Internet access provider. Some Internet access providers support
only certain brands of routers and, while it is true that other routers may work, you might be taking a risk if you pur-
chase an unsupported router. With the popularity of wireless home networks, though, some Internet access providers
now provide a wireless router as part of the subscription service, often for an additional fee. You should investigate
closely the needs for the Wi-Fi router to ensure compatibility with your Internet access provider.
In addition to the router, each computer that is to be part of the Wi-Fi network needs a wireless network adapter. This
device allows the computers to communicate with one another. Most external wireless network adapters plug in either a
PC Card slot, ExpressCard slot, or a USB connection. Many notebook computers have a built-in wireless network adapter.
Finally, some home networks have a combination of wired and wireless devices. In these networks, the modem 
connects to the wireless router, and computers on the network either connect to the wireless router using a wireless or
wired connection.
Once the Wi-Fi equipment is assembled, you are ready to connect your home network.
Exercise
1. Using your Web research skills, determine the type of IEEE 802.11 standard used by modems available from Internet
access providers. What percentage use 802.11b? What percentage use 802.11g? If your modem uses 802.11b but your
wireless network router is 802.11g, what happens? Based on your research, which router do you recommend? Submit
your answers to your instructor.
CONNECT THE PHYSICAL DEVICES
Once you have assembled your equipment, you can connect the devices in the network.
Usually, the modem will be connected to the source of the Internet transmission (DSL, cable, or satellite). Then the modem
is connected to the wireless router, which in turn is connected to the computers on your network.

After these connections are completed, each of the computers that will be used in the network that do not have a built-in
wireless network adapter must have the adapter attached, often by using a USB connection. Once these connections are
made, the network can be created.
CREATE THE NETWORK
To establish a network, operating system software must be configured based on the design of
your network. To begin the process on a Windows Vista computer, you should run the ‘Set up a wireless router or access

Step 1:
A membership services 
associate uses a digital camera
to take a photo of the new
member and uses a keyboard 
to enter other member data into 
the computer.
DATABASES, DATA, AND INFORMATION
A
database is a collection of data organized in a manner that allows access, retrieval, and
use of that data. Data is a collection of unprocessed items, which can include text, num-
bers, images, audio, and video. Information is processed data; that is, it is organized,
meaningful, and useful. 
Computers process data in a database into information. A database at a members-only discount
warehouse, for example, contains data about members, e.g., member data, purchases data, etc. As
shown in Figure 9-1, a computer at the warehouse processes new member data and then sends
receipt and ID card information to the printers.
With database software, often called a database management system (DBMS), users create a
computerized database; add, change, and delete data in the database; sort and retrieve data from
the database; and create forms and reports from the data in the database. Database software
includes many powerful features, as you will discover later in this chapter.

Step 3:
A computer extracts the member 
data from the disk and obtains 
the amount due based on 
the type of membership

Step 4:
When the amount 
due is paid, the 
receipt and the 
member ID card 
print.
Step 2:
The member data, including
the photo, is stored in a 
database on a hard disk.
Data Integrity
Most companies realize that data is one of their more valuable assets — because data is used to
generate information. Many business transactions take less time when employees have instant access
to information. To ensure that data is accessible on demand, a company must manage and protect its
data just as it would any other resource. Thus, it is vital that the data has integrity and is kept secure. 
For a computer to produce correct information, the data that is entered into a database must
have integrity. Data integrity identifies the quality of the data. An erroneous member address in a
member database is an example of incorrect data. When a database contains this type of error, it
loses integrity. Data integrity is very important because computers and people use information to
make decisions and take actions.
Garbage in, garbage out (GIGO) is a computing phrase that points out the accuracy of a com-
puter’s output depends on the accuracy of the input. If you enter incorrect data into a computer
(garbage in), the computer will produce incorrect information (garbage out).

Qualities of Valuable Information
The information that data generates also is an important asset. People make decisions daily
using all types of information such as receipts, bank statements, pension plan summaries, stock
analyses, and credit reports. In a business, managers make decisions based on sales trends, 
competitors’ products and services, production processes, and even employee skills.
To assist with sound decision making, the information must have value. For it to be valuable,
information should be accurate, verifiable, timely, organized, accessible, useful, and cost-effective.
• Accurate information is error free. Inaccurate information can lead to incorrect decisions. For
example, consumers assume their credit report is accurate. If your credit report incorrectly
shows past due payments, a bank may not lend you money for a car or house.
• Verifiable information can be proven as correct or incorrect. For example, security personnel at
an airport usually request some type of photo identification to verify that you are the person
named on the ticket.
• Timely information has an age suited to its use. A decision to build additional schools in a 
particular district should be based on the most recent census report — not on one that is 20
years old.
Most information loses its value with time. Some information, such as information about
trends, gains value as time passes and more information is obtained.
• Organized information is arranged to suit the needs and requirements of the decision maker.
Different people may need the same information presented in a different manner. For example,
an inventory manager may want an inventory report to list out-of-stock items first. The 
purchasing agent, instead, wants the report alphabetized by vendor.
• Accessible information is available when the decision maker needs it. Having to wait for 
information may delay an important decision.
• Useful information has meaning to the person who receives it. Most information is important
only to certain people or groups of people. 
• Cost-effective information should give more value than it costs to produce. A company 
occasionally should review the information it produces to determine if it still is cost-effective
to produce. Sometimes, it is not easy to place a value on information. For this reason, some
companies create information only on demand, that is, as people request it, instead of on a 
regular basis. Many companies make information available online. Users then can access and
print online information as they need it. 
THE HIERARCHY OF DATA
Data is organized in layers. In the computer profession, data is classified in a hierarchy. Each
higher level of data consists of one or more items from the lower level. For example, a member
has an address, and an address consists of letters and numbers. Depending on the application
and the user, different terms describe the various levels of the hierarchy. 
As shown in Figure 9-2, a database contains files, a file contains records, a record contains
fields, and a field is made up of one or more characters. The Discount Warehouse database con-
tains four files: Member, Membership Plans, Member Purchases, and Products. The Member file
contains records about current members. The Membership Plans file contains records identifying
a type of membership and its annual fee. The Member Purchases file contains records about
members’ purchases at the discount warehouse, and the Products file contains records about
items for sale. Each field in a record contains many characteristics, one of which is the field size.

335
THE HIERARCHY OF DATA
Characters
As Chapter 4 discussed, a bit is the smallest unit of data the computer can process. Eight bits grouped
together in a unit comprise a byte. In the ASCII and EBCDIC coding schemes, each byte represents a
single character, which can be a number (4), letter (R), punctuation mark (?), or other symbol (&).
Fields
A field is a combination of one or more related characters or bytes and is the smallest unit of data
a user accesses. A field name uniquely identifies each field. When searching for data in a database,
you often specify the field name. Field names for the data in the Membership Plans file
are Membership Code, Membership Name, and Annual Fee.
A database uses a variety of characteristics, such as field size and data type, to define
each field. The field size defines the maximum number of characters a field can contain.
For example, the Membership Code field contains two characters. Valid entries include 
BB (Basic Business), AB (Advantage Business), BP (Basic Personal), and AP (Advantage
Personal). Thus, as shown in Figure 9-2, the Membership Code field has a field size of 2.
The type of data in a field is an important consideration. Figure 9-3 identifies the data
types for fields in the Membership Plans and Member files. The data type specifies the
kind of data a field can contain and how the field is used. Common data types include:
• Text (also called alphanumeric) — letters, numbers, or special characters
• Numeric — numbers only
• AutoNumber — unique number automatically assigned by the DBMS to each added
record
• Currency — dollar and cent amounts or numbers containing decimal values
• Date — month, day, year, and sometimes time information
• Memo — lengthy text entries
• Yes/No — only the values Yes or No (or True or False)
• Hyperlink — Web address that links to a document or a Web page
• Object — photo, audio, video, or a document created in other programs

Are Portable Storage Devices a Threat to Businesses? 
For years, and to the dismay of many companies, workers have carted home portable storage devices loaded with valuable company information.
Today’s USB flash drives, portable media players, smart phones, and external hard disks allow employees to pack volumes of valuable information
in their pockets. The term podslurping has been coined to refer to the practice of stealing data using such devices. Companies now must be
concerned with visitors or disgruntled employees walking off with complete customer lists, employee databases, or secret product designs and
strategies on portable storage devices. Almost every instance of such data theft involves a company insider. Some companies have gone as far as
banning some portable media players and other portable storage devices from the company premises. Other companies disable USB and FireWire
ports on employee computers, thereby preventing the devices from being used at all.
How can companies control employee use of portable storage devices to copy company information? Should companies be allowed to dictate the
types of personal devices that visitors and employees bring to the workplace? Why or why not? Is the problem solvable, just manageable, or should a
company find other ways to secure its information? Why? Should companies be held legally liable when such data theft occurs? Why or why not?
Records
A record is a group of related fields. For example, a member record includes a set of fields
about one member. A key field, or primary key, is a field that uniquely identifies each record 
in a file. The data in a key field is unique to a specific record. For example, the Member ID field
uniquely identifies each member because no two members can have the same Member ID.
Files
A data file is a collection of related records
stored on a storage medium such as a hard disk,
CD, or DVD. A Member file at a discount ware-
house might consist of hundreds of individual
member records. Each member record in
the file contains the same fields. Each 
field, however, contains different data.
Figure 9-4 shows a small sample Member
file that contains four member records, each 
with eleven fields. 
A database includes a group of related data
files. Read Ethics & Issues 9-1 for a discussion
related to a use of databases.

CHAPTER 9
DATABASE MANAGEMENT
MAINTAINING DATA
File maintenance refers to the procedures that keep data current. File maintenance procedures
include adding records to, changing records in, and deleting records from a file.
Adding Records
Users add new records to a file when they obtain new data. If a new member wants to join the
discount warehouse club, a membership services associate adds a new record to the Member file
at the discount warehouse. The process required to add this record to the file might include the
following steps:
1. A membership services associate uses the database management system (DBMS) to display a
Member Maintenance form that gives him or her access to the Member file. The associate then
clicks the New button, which begins the process of adding a record to the Member file.
2. The associate fills in the fields of the member record with data (except for the Member ID,
which automatically is assigned by the DBMS).
3. The associate takes a picture of the member using a digital camera. The DBMS stores this
picture in the Member file and prints it on a member ID card.
4. The membership services associate verifies the data on the screen and then presses a key on
the keyboard or clicks a button on the screen to add the new member record to the Member
file. The system software determines where to write the record on the disk (Figure 9-5).

The membership
services associate inserts the member
ID card to display the member’s record.
After looking at the photo on the screen
to confirm that the correct member
record is displayed, the associate
changes the member’s address.
Changing Records
Generally, users change a record in a file for two reasons: (1) to correct inaccurate data or (2) to
update old data with new data.
Suppose, for example, that Benjamin Tu moves from 2204 Elm Court to 76 Ash Street. The process
to change the address and update Benjamin Tu’s record might include the following steps:
1. The membership services associate displays the Member Maintenance form.
2. Assuming Benjamin Tu is present, the services associate inserts Benjamin’s member ID card 
in a card reader to display his member record on the screen. If Benjamin did not have his ID
card or was not present, the associate could enter Benjamin’s member ID — if Benjamin knew
it. Otherwise, the associate could enter Tu in the Last Name field, which would retrieve all
members with that same last name. The associate then would scroll through all of the
retrieved records to determine which one is Benjamin’s.
3. The DBMS displays data about Benjamin Tu so that the associate can confirm the correct
member record is displayed.
4. The associate enters the new street address, 76 Ash Street.
5. The membership services associate verifies the data on the screen and then, if required, clicks
the Save button to change the record in the Member file. The DBMS changes the record on the
disk (Figure 9-6).
338
CHAPTER 9
DATABASE MANAGEMENT
Deleting Records
When a record no longer is needed, a user deletes it from a file. Assume a member named
Elena Gupta is moving out of the country. The process required to delete a record from a file
includes the following steps:
1. The membership services associate displays the Member Maintenance form.
2. The associate displays Elena Gupta’s member record on the screen.
3. The associate confirms the correct member record is displayed. Then, the associate clicks the
Delete Record command to delete the record from the Member file and then, if required,
clicks the Save button to save the modified file.
record changed
C6672_Ch09_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:24 PM  Page 338

DBMSs use a variety
of techniques to man-
age deleted records.
Sometimes, the
DBMS removes the
record from the file
immediately, which
means the deleted
record cannot be
restored. Other
times, the record is
flagged, or marked, so the DBMS will not process it 
again. In this case, the DBMS places an asterisk (*) 
or some other character at the beginning of the
record (Figure 9-7).
DBMSs that maintain inactive data for an
extended period commonly flag records. For 
example, a discount warehouse might flag 
canceled memberships. When a DBMS flags a
deleted record, the record remains physically 
on the disk. The record, however, is deleted 
logically because the DBMS will not process it. 
From time to time, users should run a utility program that removes the flagged records and 
reorganizes current records. For example, the discount warehouse may remove from disk any
accounts that have been canceled for more than one year.
Validating Data
Validation is the process of comparing data with a set of rules or values to find out if the data is
correct. Many programs perform a validity check that analyzes entered data to help ensure that it is
correct. For instance, when a membership services associate adds or changes data in a member
record, the DBMS tests the entered data.
With an annual membership fee, you would
expect to see numbers before and after a decimal
point. For example, a valid annual membership
fee is 30.00. An entry of XR.WP clearly is not 
correct. If the entered data fails a validity check,
the computer should display an error message
that instructs the user to enter the data again.
Validity checks reduce data entry errors. 
Various types of validity checks include alpha-
betic checks, numeric checks, range checks, 
consistency checks, and completeness checks.
Check digits also validate data accuracy. The 
following paragraphs describe the purpose of
these validity checks. The table in Figure 9-8
illustrates several of these validity checks and
shows valid data that passes the check and
invalid data that fails the check.
ALPHABETIC/NUMBERIC CHECK
An alphabetic check ensures that users enter only alphabetic data
into a field. A numeric check ensures that users enter only numeric data into a field. For example,
data in a First Name field should contain only characters from the alphabet. Data in a Postal Code
field should contain numbers (with the exception of the special characters such as a hyphen).

C6672_Ch09_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:24 PM  Page 339

RANGE CHECK
A range check determines whether a number is within a specified range. Assume
the lowest annual membership fee at the discount warehouse is $25.00 and the highest is $90.00.
A range check on the Annual Fee field ensures it is a value between $25.00 and $90.00.
CONSISTENCY CHECK
A consistency check tests the data in two or more associated fields to
ensure that the relationship is logical and their data is in the correct format. For example, the
value in a Date Joined field cannot occur earlier in time than a value in a Birth Date field.
COMPLETENESS CHECK
A completeness check verifies that a required field contains data. For
example, some fields cannot be left blank; others require a minimum number of characters. One
completeness check can ensure that data exists in a Last Name field. Another can ensure that a
day, month, and year are included in a Birth Date field.
CHECK DIGIT
A check digit is a number(s) or character(s) that is appended to or inserted in 
a primary key value. A check digit often confirms the accuracy of a primary key value. Bank
account, credit card, and other identification numbers often include one or more check digits. 
A program determines the check digit by applying a formula to the numbers in the primary
key value. An oversimplified illustration of a check digit formula is to add the numbers in the
primary key. For example, if the primary key is 1367, this formula would add these numbers 
(1 + 3 + 6 + 7) for a sum of 17. Next, the formula would add the numbers in the result (1 + 7) to
generate a check digit of 8. The primary key then is 13678. This example began with the original
primary key value, 1367, then the check digit, 8, was appended.
When a data entry clerk enters the primary key of 13678, for example, to look up an existing
record, the program determines whether the check digit is valid. If the clerk enters an incorrect
primary key, such as 13778, the check digit entered (8) will not match the computed check digit (9).
In this case, the program displays an error message that instructs the user to enter the primary key
value again.

FILE PROCESSING VERSUS DATABASES
Almost all application programs use the file processing approach, the database approach, or a
combination of both approaches to store and manage data. The following pages discuss these
two approaches.

File Processing Systems
In the past, many organizations exclusively used file processing systems to store and manage
data. In a typical file processing system, each department or area within an organization has its
own set of files. The records in one file may not relate to the records in any other file.
Companies have used file processing systems for many years. A lot of these systems, however,
have two major weaknesses: they have redundant data and they isolate data.
• Data Redundancy — Each department or area in a company has its own files in a file
processing system. Thus, the same fields are stored in multiple files. If a file processing system
is used at the discount warehouse, for example, the Member file and the Member Purchases file
store the same members’ names and addresses.
Duplicating data in this manner wastes resources such as storage space and people’s time.
When new members are added or member data is changed, file maintenance tasks consume
additional time because people must update multiple files that contain the same data.
Data redundancy also can increase the chance of errors. If a member changes his or her
address, for example, the discount warehouse must update the address wherever it appears. In
this example, the Address field is in the Member file and also in the Member Purchases file. If
the Address field is not changed in all the files where it is stored, then discrepancies among the
files exist.
• Isolated Data — Often it is difficult to access data stored in separate files in different
departments. Sharing data from multiple, separate files is a complicated procedure and usually
requires the experience of a computer programmer.
The Database Approach
When a company uses the database approach, many programs and users share the data in the
database. A discount warehouse’s database most likely contains data about members, member-
ship plans, member purchases, and products. As shown in Figure 9-9, various areas within the
discount warehouse share and interact with the data in this database. The database does secure
its data, however, so that only authorized users can access certain data items. While a user is
working with the database, the DBMS resides in the memory of the computer.

The database approach addresses many of the weaknesses associated with file processing 
systems. The following list presents some strengths of the database approach.
• Reduced Data Redundancy — Most data items are stored in only one file, which greatly
reduces duplicate data. Figure 9-10 demonstrates the differences between how a database
application and a file processing application might store data.
• Improved Data Integrity — When users modify data in the database, they make changes to 
one file instead of multiple files. Thus, the database approach increases the data’s integrity by
reducing the possibility of introducing inconsistencies.
• Shared Data — The data in a database environment belongs to and is shared, usually over a
network, by the entire organization. Companies that use databases typically have security
settings to define who can access, add, change, and delete the data in a database.
• Easier Access — The database approach allows nontechnical users to access and maintain 
data, providing they have the necessary privileges.
• Reduced Development Time — It often is easier and faster to develop programs that use the
database approach.
Databases have many advantages as well as some disadvantages. A database can be more 
complex than a file processing system. People with special training usually develop larger 
databases and their associated applications. Databases also require more memory, storage, and
processing power than file processing systems.
Data in a database can be more vulnerable than data in file processing systems. A database can
store a lot of data in a single file. Many users and programs share and depend on this data. If the
database is not operating properly or is damaged or destroyed, users may not be able to perform 
their jobs. Furthermore, unauthorized users potentially could gain access to a single database file
that contains personal and confidential data. To protect their valuable database resource, individu-
als and companies should establish and follow security procedures. Despite these limitations, many
business and home users work with databases because of their tremendous advantages.

In the file processing environment,
both files contain all three membership plans’ data
fields. In a database environment, only the Membership
Plans file contains the Membership Name and Annual
Fee fields. Other files, however, such as the Member
file, contain the Membership Code, which links to the
Membership Plans file when membership plans data 
is needed.
Can a database eliminate
redundant data completely?
No, a database reduces redundant data — it
does not eliminate it. Key fields link data
together in a database. For example, a Student
ID field will exist in any database file that
requires access to student data. Thus, a
Student ID is duplicated (exists in many data-
base files) in the database. For more informa-

DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
As previously discussed, a database management system (DBMS), or database program, is software
that allows you to create, access, and manage a database. DBMSs are available for many sizes and
types of computers (Figure 9-11). Whether designed for a small or large computer, most DBMSs 
perform common functions. The following pages discuss functions common to most DBMSs.

Data Dictionary
A data dictionary contains data
about each file in the database and each
field within those files. For each file, it
stores details such as the file name, des-
cription, the file’s relationship to other
files, and the number of records in the file.
For each field, it stores details such as the
field name, description, field type, field
size, default value, validation rules, and the
field’s relationship to other fields. Figure 
9-12 shows how a data dictionary might list
data for a Member file.

File Retrieval and Maintenance
A DBMS provides several tools that allow users and programs to retrieve and maintain data in
the database. To retrieve or select data in a database, you query it. A query is a request for specific
data from the database. Users can instruct the DBMS to display, print, or store the results of a
query. The capability of querying a database is one of the more powerful database features.
A DBMS offers several methods to retrieve and maintain its data. The four more commonly used
are query languages, query by example, forms, and report generators. The following paragraphs
describe each of these methods. Read Looking Ahead 9-1 for a look at a future use of queries.
QUERY LANGUAGE
A query language consists of simple, English-like statements that allow users 
to specify the data to display, print, or store. Users can retrieve actual data in a query or display the
results of calculations performed on the data. Each query language has its own grammar and vocabu-
lary. A person without a programming background usually can learn a query language in a short time.
To simplify the query process, many DBMSs provide wizards to guide users through the steps 
of creating a query. Figure 9-13 shows how to use the Simple Query Wizard in Microsoft Office
Access 2007 to display the First Name, Last Name, and E-mail Address fields from the Member
file. Instead of using the wizard, you could enter the query language statement shown in Figure
9-13 directly in the DBMS to display the results shown in Step 3.

QUERY BY EXAMPLE
Most DBMSs include a query by example (QBE) feature that has a graphical
user interface to assist users with retrieving data. Figure 9-14 shows a sample QBE screen for a
query that searches for and lists members on the Basic Personal plan; that is, their Membership
Code field value is equal to BP.

DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Archive an Entire Lifetime
Photo albums, memory boxes, and notebooks are relics of the past for Microsoft researcher
Gordon Bell, and they may be for you, too. Bell is recording practically everything in his entire
life and storing these memories in a searchable SQL Server-based database.
Bell’s MyLifeBits project is composed of two parts: one that digitizes all aspects of his life
experiences, such as telephone calls, faxes, photos, cards, and music files; the second that
allows anyone to create a lifetime library on a home computer.
Bell’s lifelog, or flog, is one of several storage systems being developed that document
conversations, movements, and photos automatically. Telecommunications companies and
university researchers are developing tools designed specifically for lifelogging, and many of
the projects involve recording and then querying health-related data. Privacy experts are
debating the legality of lifelogging in both public and private locations because people’s con-
versations and photos could be recorded without their consent. For more information, visit
scsite.com/dcf5e/ch9/looking and then click Lifelog.
FIGURE 9-14
Access has many QBE capabilities. One QBE technique is Filter by Form, which uses a form to
show available fields. The database program retrieves records that match criteria you enter in the form fields. This
example searches for members whose Membership Code is equal to BP.
FIGURE 9-14c

criteria
FORM
A form, sometimes called a data entry form, is a window on the screen that provides areas for
entering or changing data in a database. You use forms (such as the Member Maintenance form in Figure
9-5 on page 337) to retrieve and maintain the data in a database.
To reduce data entry errors, well-designed forms should validate data as it is entered. When designing
a form using a DBMS, you can make the form attractive and easy to use by incorporating color, shading,
lines, boxes, and graphics; varying the fonts and font styles; and using other formatting features.

REPORT GENERATOR
A report generator, also called a report writer, allows users to design a
report on the screen, retrieve data into the report design, and then display or print the report
(Figure 9-15). Report generators usually allow you to format page numbers and dates; titles and
column headings; subtotals and totals; and fonts, font sizes, color, and shading.
Backup and Recovery
Occasionally a database is damaged or destroyed
because of hardware failure, a problem with the soft-
ware, human error, or a catastrophe such as fire or
flood. A DBMS provides a variety of techniques to
restore the database to a usable form in case it is
damaged or destroyed.
• A backup, or copy, of the entire database should be
made on a regular basis. Some DBMSs have their
own built-in backup utilities. Others require users
to purchase a separate backup utility, or use one
included with the operating system.
• More complex DBMSs maintain a log, which is a
listing of activities that change the contents of the
database. 
• A DBMS that creates a log usually provides a
recovery utility. A recovery utility uses the logs
and/or backups to restore a database when it
becomes damaged or destroyed. 
• Continuous backup is a backup plan in which all
data is backed up whenever a change is made.
Should People Be Punished for Accidently Accessing Stolen Data?
A university student discovered a file containing private student information, including Social Security numbers
and student grades, on a publicly accessible area of a university computer. Instead of notifying authorities, he
took the file to the student newspaper in the hopes of making sure that the security breach was made public.
After the newspaper published an article about the situation, the student was nearly expelled and the newspaper’s
adviser was fired for violating the university’s computer policies. Some privacy advocates felt that the outcome
was a case of shooting the messenger. 
More and more often, institutions attempt to resolve security breaches as quietly as possible, fearing that pub-
licity may cause financial loss and loss of public confidence, and may encourage hackers to target the institu-
tion. In some cases, an institution may file lawsuits against those who make security breaches public, including
reporters. If you find a stolen or lost file that includes personal information, such as Social Security numbers,
should you be required to report the incident to pertinent authorities? Why or why not? In the situation described
above, should the student and newspaper be praised or punished for making the security breach public knowl-
edge? Why? How would you handle such a situation? Why? Should institutions be required to disclose to the
public all security breaches? Why or why not?

Data Security
A DBMS provides means to ensure that only authorized users access data at permitted times. In
addition, most DBMSs allow different levels of access privileges to be identified for each field in
the database. These access privileges define the actions that a specific user or group of users can
perform. Access privileges for data involve establishing who can enter new data, change existing
data, delete unwanted data, and view data. Read Ethics & Issues 9-2 for a related discussion.

RELATIONAL, OBJECT-ORIENTED, 
AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATABASES
Every database and DBMS is based on a specific data
model. A data model consists of rules and standards that
define how the database organizes data. A data model
defines how users view the organization of the data. It
does not define how the operating system actually
arranges the data on the disk.
Three popular data models in use today are relational,
object-oriented, and multidimensional. A database typi-
cally is based on one data model. Some databases, how-
ever, combine features of the relational and object-oriented
data models. The following sections discuss relational,
object-oriented, and multidimensional databases.
Relational Databases
Today, a relational database is a widely used type of database. A relational database is a 
database that stores data in tables that consist of rows and columns. Each row has a primary 
key and each column has a unique name.
As discussed earlier in this chapter, a file processing environment uses the terms file, record,
and field to represent data. A relational database uses terms different from a file processing sys-
tem. A developer of a relational database refers to a file as a relation, a record as a tuple, and a
field as an attribute. A user of a relational database, by contrast, refers to a file as a table, a record
as a row, and a field as a column. Figure 9-16 summarizes this varied terminology.

SQL
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a query language that allows users to manage,
update, and retrieve data. SQL has special keywords and rules that users include in SQL state-
ments. For example, the SQL statement in Figure 9-18a creates the results shown in Figure 9-18b. 
Most relational database products for servers and mainframes include SQL. Many personal
computer databases also include SQL.
In addition to storing data, a relational database also stores data relationships. A relationship
is a connection within the data. In a relational database, you can set up a relationship between
tables at any time. The tables must have a common column (field). For example, you would relate
the Member table and the Membership Plans table using the Membership Code column. Figure 
9-17 illustrates these relational database concepts. In a relational database, the only data redun-
dancy (duplication) exists in the common columns (fields). The database uses these common
columns for relationships.
Many businesses use relational databases for payroll, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
general ledger, inventory, order entry, invoicing, and other business-related functions.

Object-Oriented Databases
An object-oriented database (OODB) stores data in objects. An object is an item that contains
data, as well as the actions that read or process the data. A Member object, for example, might con-
tain data about a member such as Member ID, First Name, Last Name, Address, and so on. It also
could contain instructions about how to print the member record or the formula required to calcu-
late a member’s balance due. 
Object-oriented databases have several advantages compared with relational databases: they can
store more types of data, access this data faster, and allow programmers to reuse objects. An
object-oriented database stores unstructured data more efficiently than a relational database.
Unstructured data includes photos, video clips, audio clips, and documents. When users query an
object-oriented database, the results often are displayed more quickly than the same query of a
relational database. If an object already exists, programmers can reuse it instead of recreating a
new object — saving on program development time.
OBJECT QUERY LANGUAGE
Object-oriented databases often use a query language called object
query language (OQL) to manipulate and retrieve data. OQL is similar to SQL. OQL and SQL
use many of the same rules, grammar, and keywords. Because OQL is a relatively new query 
language, not all object databases support it.
Multidimensional Databases
A multidimensional database stores data in dimensions. Whereas a relational database is a
two-dimensional table, a multidimensional database can store more than two dimensions of data.
These multiple dimensions allow users to access and analyze any view of the database data.
A Webmaster at a retailing business may want information about product sales and customer
sales for each region spanning a given time. A manager at the same business may want informa-
tion about product sales by department for each sales representative spanning a given time. A
multidimensional database can consolidate this type of data from multiple dimensions at very
high rates of speed. Nearly every multidimensional database has a dimension of time. The con-
tent of other dimensions varies depending on the subject.
No standard query language exists for multidimensional databases. Each database uses its own
language. Most are similar to SQL.
DATA WAREHOUSES
One application that typically uses multidimensional databases is a data
warehouse. A data warehouse is a huge database that stores and manages the data required to
analyze historical and current transactions. Through a data warehouse, managers and other users
access transactions and summaries of transactions quickly and efficiently. Some major credit card
companies monitor and manage customers’ credit card transactions using a data warehouse.
Additionally, consumers can access their own transactions in the data warehouse via the Web. A
data warehouse typically has a user-friendly interface, so that users easily can interact with its data.
A smaller version of a data warehouse is the data mart. A data mart contains a database that
helps a specific group or department make decisions. Marketing and sales departments may have
their own separate data marts. Individual groups or departments often extract data from the data
warehouse to create their data marts.

WEB DATABASES
One of the more profound features of the Web is the vast amount of information it provides. The
Web offers information about jobs, travel destinations, television programming, pictures, movies,
videos, local and national weather, sporting events, and legislative information. You can shop 
for just about any product or service, buy or sell stocks, search for a job, and make airline reserva-
tions. Much of this and other information on the Web exists in databases. Some Web databases are
collaborative databases, where users store and share photos, videos, recordings, and other personal
media with other registered users (Figure 9-19). Read Ethics & Issues 9-3 for a related discussion. 
To access data in a Web database, you fill in a form or enter search text on a Web page. Many
search engines such as Yahoo! use databases to store Web site descriptions. To access the data-
base, you enter search text into the search engine. A Web database usually resides on a database
server. A database server is a
computer that stores and pro-
vides access to a database. 
In addition to accessing infor-
mation, users provide informa-
tion to Web databases. Many
Web sites request users to enter
personal information, such as
name, address, telephone num-
ber, and preferences, into an 
e-form (electronic form). The
database then stores this per-
sonal information for future
use. A company, for example,
may send e-mail messages to
certain groups of customers.

Who Should Be Held Accountable for the Rash of Database Security Breaches?
Over the course of three years, a privacy advocacy group documented the fact that more than 160 million records that contain personal 
information were accessed illegally or stolen. The records were allowed to be accessed because of carelessness by government agencies,
educational institutions, and corporations. Information such as credit card numbers, credit history, and employment information often are
involved in such security breaches. In one case, a company determined that a particular data breach cost the company more than $168 mil-
lion. Institutions typically have their own set of guidelines to manage the security of such information, yet the number of security breaches is
escalating. While some have proposed laws requiring stricter controls for how institutions handle private data and provide for harsher penal-
ties for those not properly securing data, corporations resist such efforts. They claim that the costs involved in such measures would hurt
their capability of competing with corporations in other states and countries that are not bound by the same rules. Many institutions voluntar-
ily notify individuals whose information was breached, and some even compensate victims; for example, some provide credit monitoring for
free. Who should be held accountable for the rash of database security breaches? Why? Should the government enact stronger laws regard-
ing data security? Why or why not? Should institutions be required to notify individuals whose data has been breached, and if so, should
they be required to compensate the victims? Why or why not?

DATABASE ADMINISTRATION
Managing a company’s database requires a great deal of coordination. The role of coordinating
the use of the database belongs to the database analysts and administrators. To carry out their
responsibilities, these IT (information technology) professionals follow database design guidelines
and need cooperation from all database users.
Database Design Guidelines
A carefully designed database makes 
it easier for a user to query the database,
modify the data, and create reports. The
guidelines shown in Figure 9-20 apply to
databases of all sizes.
Role of the Database Analysts 
and Administrators
The database analysts and
administrators are responsible for
managing and coordinating all database
activities. The database analyst (DA)
decides on the proper placement of fields,
defines the relationships among data, and
identifies users’ access privileges. The
database administrator (DBA) requires 
a more technical inside view of the data.
The DBA creates and maintains the data 
dictionary, manages security of the 
database, monitors the performance 
of the database, and checks backup 
and recovery procedures.
In small companies, one person often
is both the DA and DBA. In larger com-
panies, the responsibilities of the DA
and DBA are split among two or more
people.
Role of the Employee as a User
Employees should learn how to use
the data in the database effectively. The
amount of information available often
amazes first-time database users. Instant
access to information helps employees
perform their jobs more effectively.
Today, employees access databases from
their office desktop computers, notebook
computers, or even smart phones and
other mobile devices (Figure 9-21).
The maintenance of a database is an
ongoing task that companies measure
constantly against their overall goals.

DATABASE ADMINISTRATION
DATABASE DESIGN GUIDELINES
1. Determine the purpose of the database.
2. Design the tables or files.
- Design tables or files on paper first.
- Each table or file should contain data about one subject. The Member table, for
example, contains data about members.
3. Design the records and fields for each table or file.
- Be sure every record has a unique primary key.
- Use separate fields for logically distinct items. For example, a name could be
stored in six fields: Title (Mr., Mrs., Dr., etc.), First Name, Middle Name, Last
Name, Suffix (Jr., Sr., etc.), and Nickname.
- Do not create fields for information that can be derived from entries in other
fields. For example, do not include a field for Age. Instead, store the birthdate and
compute the age.
- Allow enough space for each field.
- Set default values for frequently entered data.
4. Determine the relationships among the tables or files.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter discussed how data and information are valuable assets to an organization. The 
chapter also presented methods for maintaining high-quality data and assessing the quality of valu-
able information. It then discussed the advantages of organizing data in a database and described 
various types of databases (read Looking Ahead 9-2 for a look at a future use of databases). It also
presented the roles of the database analysts and administrators.
Barcodes Identify World’s Animal, Plant Species
Only a few of the 3,500 species of mosquitoes transmit infections such as malaria, dengue fever, and the West Nile
virus, so scientists need an easy method of distinguishing the harmful and harmless species. A short DNA sequence,
called the barcode of life, can speed identification of known organisms and facilitate recognizing new species.
The Consortium for the Barcode of Life is attempting to build a public database composed of the barcodes of the
earth’s 1.8 million known animal and plant species. This group of scientists from nearly 50 nations can identify one
species in a few hours, and they have logged about 30,000 species since the Consortium’s beginnings in 2004.
Along with identifying infection-carrying mosquitoes, the DNA database will be useful to locate the birds that
are prone to striking aircraft so that pilots can avoid flying into their paths. In addition the database will help 
farmers locate and then control fruit flies. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch9/looking and then 
click DNA Barcode.
Database Administrator
Most businesses and organizations are built around databases. Access to timely, accurate, and relevant 
information is a company’s lifeline. A database administrator (DBA) creates, applies, supports, and 
administers the policies and procedures for maintaining a company’s database. Database administrators 
construct logical and physical descriptions of the database, establish database parameters, develop data 
models characterizing data elements, ensure database integrity, and coordinate database security mea-
sures including developing and implementing disaster recovery and archiving procedures. They also use
query languages to obtain reports of the information in the database. With the large amounts of sensitive data generated, data integrity,
backup, and security have become increasingly important aspects of the administrator’s responsibilities. 
Administering a database requires a great deal of mental work and the ability to focus on finite details. Database administrators must 
be able to read and comprehend business-related information, organize data in a logical manner, apply general rules to specific problems,
identify business principles and practices, and communicate clearly with database users. Being proficient with a particular database such 
as Oracle, Informix, Sybase, or SQL Server is an added advantage. The real key, however, is learning, understanding, and becoming an
expert in database design.
Database administrators usually have a bachelor’s or associate’s degree and experience with computer programming, relational 
databases, query languages, and online analytical processing. Typical salaries for database administrators are between $75,000 and
$97,000, depending on experience. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch9/careers and then click Database Administrator.

Oracle
Database Software Developer
More than half of the FORTUNE 100 companies use an Oracle product as their 
primary database, but Oracle’s quest, according to CEO Larry Ellison, is to have its
customers convert all their database applications to Oracle’s software.
Ellison and two partners founded the company in 1977 with the intent of developing 
a commercially viable relational database. When their Oracle database was released, it
was an immediate success and changed the way companies stored and managed infor-
mation. For the first time, separate data tables could be connected by a common field.
The company is the world’s second largest independent software company behind
Microsoft. Its 10 actual or proposed acquisitions in 2007 strengthened the company’s
domination of the database community. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/
ch9/companies and then click Oracle.
Sybase
Managing Data for the Unwired Enterprise
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, estimate that 95 percent of the
data produced by major corporations never is used after it is stored in a database
because it is disorganized and inaccessible. 
Sybase helps companies unlock and use this data whenever and wherever needed
through its unwired enterprise. This data access solution helps mobile database
users tap into corporate networks, often wirelessly. The company focuses especially
on Enterprise Portal (EP) solutions, which convert stored data into information that
can be used by customers, partners, and suppliers.
For more than 20 years, Sybase has produced software that links platforms,
servers, databases, applications, and mobile devices. The company’s unique
employee perks helped earn it a place on the list of Canada’s Top 100 Employers in
2007. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch9/companies and then click

E. F. Codd
Relational Database Model Inventor
The majority of large and small databases are structured on the relational model, which is considered one of the greatest
technological inventions of the 20th Century. E. F. Codd single-handedly is credited with developing and promoting that
model in a series of research papers beginning with his 1969 IBM Research Report, “Derivability, Redundancy, and
Consistency of Relations Stored in Large Data Banks.”
Edgar F. Codd began his career in 1949 when he joined IBM as a programming mathematician after graduating from
Oxford University. Throughout the 1950s he helped develop several IBM computers and then turned his attention to data-
base management. Among his achievements is earning the prestigious A. M. Turing Award, which is the Association for
Computing Machinery’s highest technical achievement honor given to an individual, for his relational database theory. 
For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch9/people and then click E. F. Codd.
Larry Ellison
Oracle CEO
On a visit to Kyoto, Japan, Larry Ellison became intrigued with the country’s culture and the citizens’ combination of 
confidence and humility. He says he applies these philosophical principles to his work at Oracle, where he serves as CEO.
As a young man, Ellison was interested in science and mathematics. He was inspired by E. F. Codd’s relational database
model and founded Oracle in 1977 under the name Software Development Laboratories with a $1,200 investment.
Under Ellison’s leadership, the company doubled its sales in 11 of its first 12 years. He is known for his uncanny ability to
motivate his employees and business partners toward a common goal. He predicted in 2007 that Oracle would have the best
Red Hat Linux support in the world. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch9/people and then click Larry Ellison.

Chapter Review
The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students 
regarding any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch9/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
What Is a Database?
A database is a collection of data organized in a manner that allows access, retrieval, and use of that data. Database 
software, often called a database management system (DBMS), allows users to create a computerized database; add,
change, and delete the data; sort and retrieve the data; and create forms and reports from the data.
What Are the Qualities of Valuable Information?
Data is a collection of unprocessed items, which can include text, numbers, images, audio, and video. Information is
processed data; that is, it is organized, meaningful, and useful. For information to be valuable, it should be accurate,
verifiable, timely, organized, accessible, useful, and cost-effective.
What Is Meant by Character, Field, Record, and File?
Data is classified in a hierarchy, with each level of data consisting of one or more items from the lower level. A bit is the 
smallest unit of data a computer can process. Eight bits grouped together in a unit form a byte, and each byte represents a
single character. A field is a combination of one or more related characters and is the smallest unit of data a user accesses. 
A record is a group of related fields. A data file is a collection of related records stored on a storage medium.
How Are Files Maintained?
File maintenance refers to the procedures that keep data current. File maintenance procedures include adding records
when new data is obtained, changing records to correct inaccurate data or to update old data with new data, and deleting
records when they no longer are needed. Validation is the process of comparing data with a set of rules or values to find
out if the data is correct. Many programs perform a validity check that analyzes entered data to help ensure that it is 
correct. Types of validity checks include an alphabetic check, a numeric check, a range check, a consistency check, a 
completeness check, and a check digit.
How Is a File Processing System Approach Different from a Database Approach?
In a file processing system, each department or area within an organization has its own set of data files. Two major 
weaknesses of file processing systems are redundant data (duplicated data) and isolated data. With a database approach,
many programs and users share the data in a database. The database approach reduces data redundancy, improves data
integrity, shares data, permits easier access, and reduces development time. A database, however, can be more complex
than a file processing system, requiring special training and more computer memory, storage, and processing power. 
Data in a database also can be more vulnerable than data in file processing systems.
What Functions Are Common to Most DBMSs?
With a DBMS, users can create and manipulate a computerized database. Most DBMSs perform common functions. A
data dictionary contains data about each file in the database and each field within those files. A DBMS offers several
methods to maintain and retrieve data, such as query languages, query by example, forms, and report generators. A query
language consists of simple, English-like statements that allow users to specify the data to display, print, or store. Query 
by example (QBE) has a graphical user interface that assists users with retrieving data. A form is a window on the screen
that provides areas for entering or changing data. A report generator allows users to design a report on the screen, retrieve
data into the report design, and then display or print the report. If a database is damaged or destroyed, a DBMS provides
techniques to return the database to a usable form. A backup is a copy of the database. A log is a listing of activities that
change the contents of the database. A recovery utility uses the logs and/or backups to restore the database. Continuous
backup is a backup plan in which all data is backed up whenever a change is made. To supply security, most DBMSs can
identify different levels of access privileges that define the actions a specific user or group of users can perform for each
field in a database.

What Are Characteristics of Relational, Object-Oriented, and Multidimensional Databases?
A data model consists of rules and standards that define how the database organizes data. Three popular data models 
are relational, object-oriented, and multidimensional. A relational database stores data in tables that consist of rows and
columns. A relational database developer refers to a file as a relation, a record as a tuple, and a field as an attribute. A
relational database user refers to a file as a table, a record as a row, and a field as a column. A relationship is a connection
within the data in a relational database. Structured Query Language (SQL) allows users to manage, update, and retrieve
data. An object-oriented database (OODB) stores data in objects. An object is an item that contains data, as well as the
actions that read or process the data. Object-oriented databases often use an object query language (OQL) to manipulate
and retrieve data. A multidimensional database stores data in dimensions. These multiple dimensions allow users 
to access and analyze any view of the database data. One application that uses multidimensional databases is a data
warehouse, which is a huge database system that stores and manages the data required to analyze historical and current
transactions. No standard query language exists for multidimensional databases. A smaller version of a data warehouse
is the data mart.
How Do Web Databases Work?
A Web database links to a form on a Web page. To access data in a Web database, you fill in the form or enter search text
on a Web page. A Web database usually resides on a database server, which is a computer that stores and provides access
to a database. 
What Are the Responsibilities of Database Analysts and Administrators?
A database analyst (DA) focuses on the meaning and usage of data. The DA decides on the placement of fields, defines
the relationships among data, and identifies users’ access privileges. A database administrator (DBA) requires a more
technical inside view of the data. The DBA creates and maintains the data dictionary, manages database security, monitors
database performance, and checks backup and recovery procedures. In small companies, one person often is both the DA
and DBA.

LEARN HOW TO 1: Organize and Manage Files on a Computer
Introduction
In Learn How To 1 in Chapter 3 (page 130), you learned the procedure for saving a file. In this Learn 
How To activity, you will learn how to manage files using folders and how to find a file if you cannot remember where
you saved it.
Folders
A folder is a virtual container where you can store a file on media. When you store any file, the file must be
stored in a folder. The folder symbol, together with the folder name, identifies a folder. 
You can create folders in a variety of ways. To create a folder on the desktop, 
complete the following steps:
1. Right-click the desktop in a location that does not contain an icon or
toolbar.
2. Point to New on the shortcut menu that is displayed (Figure 9-22).
3. Click Folder on the New submenu.
4. When the folder icon is displayed on the desktop, type the name 
you want to assign to the folder and then press the ENTER key. 
You should choose a name that identifies the contents of the folder.
A folder can contain other folders. This allows you to organize your 
files in a hierarchical manner so that the highest-level folder contains 
all the folders for a given subject, and lower-level folders contain more 
specific files and folders. For example, your highest-level folder could be
named Fall Semester. For each class, such as Computer Information Systems
110, you could define a folder within the Fall Semester folder. Within each
class folder, you could define folders for each week of the class, or for each
project or assignment within the class. In this manner, you would have a set
of folders, each designated for a specific use. You then would save your files
in the appropriate folder.
To create a folder within a folder, complete the following steps:
1. Double-click the folder name either on the desktop or in the window or 
dialog box in which the folder name appears.
2. Right-click a blank space in the window that is displayed.
3. Point to New on the shortcut menu that is displayed and then click Folder 
on the New submenu.
4. When the folder icon is displayed, type the name you want to assign to the 
folder, and then press the ENTER key.
To delete a folder, complete the following steps:
1. Right-click the folder.
2. On the shortcut menu that is displayed (Figure 9-23), click Delete.
3. In the Delete Folder dialog box, click the Yes button.
When you delete a folder, all the files and folders contained in the folder you are
deleting, together with all files and folders on the lower hierarchical levels, are deleted. 
If you accidentally delete a folder, complete the following steps:
1. Double-click the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop.
2. In the Recycle Bin window, select the folder you wish to restore.
3.
Click the ‘Restore this item’ button.
Using folders effectively will aid you in keeping track of files you create for your classes.

LEARN HOW TO 2: Search for Files and Folders
At times, you might store a file in a folder and then forget where you stored the file. The Search feature of Windows Vista
enables you to search storage media on a computer to find the file. To use the Search feature, complete the following
steps:
1. Click the Start button on the
Windows taskbar.
2. Click Search on the Start menu.
3. If necessary, click the All filter
button.
4. In the Search box, type the name of
the file for which you are searching.
If you do not know the entire file
name, enter as much of the file
name as you can remember. If you
do not know any portion of the file
name, click the Advanced Search
button to help narrow the search.
5. If you are performing an Advanced
Search, click the Search button to
begin the search. Otherwise,
Windows will search as you type
your search criteria into the Search
box (Figure 9-24).
6. All items containing the file 
name or partial file name will be
displayed in the Search Results in
Indexed Locations window. If the
file was not found, a message to
that effect is displayed.
7. Double-click the file name in the

COMPUTER SECURITY RISKS
T
oday, people rely on computers to create, store, and manage critical information. Thus, it
is crucial that users take measures to protect their computers and data from loss, damage,
and misuse. 
A computer security risk is any event or action that could cause a loss of or damage to computer
hardware, software, data, information, or processing capability. Some breaches to computer secu-
rity are accidental. Others are planned intrusions. Some intruders do no damage; they merely
access data, information, or programs on the computer. Other intruders indicate some evidence 
of their presence either by leaving a message or by deliberately altering or damaging data.
An intentional breach of computer security often involves a deliberate act that is against the
law. Any illegal act involving a computer generally is referred to as a computer crime. The term
cybercrime refers to online or Internet-based illegal acts. Today, cybercrime is one of the FBI’s top
three priorities.
Perpetrators of cybercrime and other intrusions fall into seven basic categories: hacker, cracker,
script kiddie, corporate spy, unethical employee, cyberextortionist, and cyberterrorist.
• The term hacker, although originally a
complimentary word for a computer
enthusiast, now has a derogatory meaning
and refers to someone who accesses a
computer or network illegally. Some
hackers claim the intent of their security
breaches is to improve security.
• A cracker also is someone who accesses 
a computer or network illegally but has
the intent of destroying data, stealing
information, or other malicious action.
Both hackers and crackers have advanced
computer and network skills.
• A script kiddie has the same intent as a
cracker but does not have the technical
skills and knowledge. Script kiddies often
are teenagers that use prewritten hacking
and cracking programs to break into
computers.
• Some corporate spies have excellent
computer and network skills and are
hired to break into a specific computer
and steal its proprietary data and
information. Unscrupulous companies
hire corporate spies, a practice known 
as corporate espionage, to gain a
competitive advantage.
• Unethical employees break into their
employers’ computers for a variety of
reasons. Some simply want to exploit 
a security weakness. Others seek finan-
cial gains from selling confidential
information. Disgruntled employees 
may want revenge.

• A cyberextortionist is someone who uses e-mail as a vehicle for extortion. These perpetrators
send a company a threatening e-mail message indicating they will expose confidential
information, exploit a security flaw, or launch an attack that will compromise the company’s
network — if they are not paid a sum of money. 
• A cyberterrorist is someone who uses the Internet or network to destroy or damage computers
for political reasons. The extensive damage might destroy the nation’s air traffic control system,
electricity-generating companies, or a telecommunications infrastructure. Cyberterrorism
usually requires a team of highly skilled individuals, millions of dollars, and several years of
planning.
Business and home users must protect, or safeguard, their computers from breaches of security
and other computer security risks. The more common computer security risks include Internet
and network attacks, unauthorized access and use, hardware theft, software theft, information
theft, and system failure (Figure 10-1). The following pages describe these computer security risks
and also discuss safeguards users might take to minimize or prevent their consequences.

INTERNET AND NETWORK ATTACKS
Information transmitted over networks has a higher degree of security risk than information kept
on a company’s premises. In a business, network administrators usually take measures to protect
a network from security risks. On the Internet, where no central administrator is present, the
security risk is greater.
Internet and network attacks that jeopardize security include computer viruses, worms, and
Trojan horses; botnets; denial of service attacks; back doors; and spoofing. The following pages
address these computer security risks and suggest measures businesses and individuals can take
to protect their computers while on the Internet or connected to a network.
Computer Viruses, Worms, and Trojan Horses
Every unprotected computer is susceptible to the first type of computer security risk — a 
computer virus, worm, and/or Trojan horse.
• A computer virus is a potentially damaging computer program that affects, or infects, a
computer negatively by altering the way the computer works without the user’s knowledge or
permission. Once the virus infects the computer, it can spread throughout and may damage
files and system software, including the operating system.
• A worm is a program that copies itself repeatedly, for example in memory or on a network,
using up resources and possibly shutting down the computer or network.
• A Trojan horse (named after the Greek myth) is a program that hides within or looks like a
legitimate program. A certain condition or action usually triggers the Trojan horse. Unlike
a virus or worm, a Trojan horse does not replicate itself to other computers.
Computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses are classified as malware (short for malicious
software), which are programs that act without a user’s knowledge and deliberately alter the
computer’s operations. Unscrupulous programmers write malware and then test it to ensure it
can deliver its payload. The payload is the destructive event or prank the program is intended 
to deliver. A computer infected by a virus, worm, or Trojan horse often has one or more of the
following symptoms:
• Screen displays unusual message or image
• Music or unusual sound plays randomly
• Available memory is less than expected
• Existing programs and files disappear
• Files become corrupted
• Programs or files do not work properly
• Unknown programs or files 
• System properties change
mysteriously appear 
• Operating system runs much slower than usual
Computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses deliver their payload on a computer in four basic
ways: when a user (1) opens an infected file, (2) runs an infected program, (3) boots the computer
with infected removable media inserted in a drive or plugged in a port, or (4) connects an unpro-
tected computer to a network. A common way computers become infected with viruses, worms,
and Trojan horses is through users opening infected e-mail attachments. Figure 10-2 shows how a
virus can spread from one computer to another through an infected e-mail attachment. 
Currently, more than 180,000 known viruses, worms, and Trojan horse programs exist. 
364
CHAPTER 10
COMPUTER SECURITY, ETHICS, AND PRIVACY
How long is an unprotected computer safe from intruders?
One security expert maintains that unprotected computers are compromised by an intruder within 12 minutes, on
average. It is possible, however, for an unprotected computer to become infected within seconds of connecting it
to a network. Slammer and Nimda, two devastating worms, wreaked worldwide havoc in 10 and 30 minutes,
respectively. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch10/faq and then click Viruses and Worms.
FAQ 10-1
C6672_CH10_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:26 PM  Page 364

Safeguards against Computer Viruses, Worms, and Trojan Horses
Users can take several precautions to protect their home and work computers from these 
malicious infections. The following paragraphs discuss these precautionary measures.
Do not start a computer with removable media, such as CDs, DVDs, and USB flash drives, 
in the drives or ports — unless you are certain the media are uninfected. Never open an e-mail
attachment unless you are expecting the attachment and it is from a trusted source. If the e-mail
message is from an unknown source, delete the e-mail message immediately — without opening
or executing any attachments. If the e-mail message is from a trusted source, but you were not
expecting an attachment, verify with the source that they intended to send you an attachment —
before opening it. Many e-mail programs allow users to preview an e-mail message before or
without opening it. Some viruses and worms can deliver their payload when a user simply pre-
views the message. Thus, you should turn off message preview in your e-mail program.
Some viruses are hidden in macros, which are instructions saved in software such as a word
processing or spreadsheet program. In programs that allow users to write macros, you should set
the macro security level so that the application software warns users that a document they are
attempting to open contains a macro. From this warning, a user chooses to disable or enable the
macro. If the document is from a trusted source, the user can enable the macro. Otherwise, it
should be disabled.
Users should install an antivirus program and update it frequently. An antivirus program protects
a computer against viruses by identifying and removing any computer viruses found in memory,
on storage media, or on incoming files. Most antivirus programs also protect against worms, Trojan
horses, and spyware. When you purchase a new computer, it often includes antivirus software.
Many e-mail servers also have antivirus programs installed to check incoming and outgoing e-mail
messages for malware.
365
INTERNET AND NETWORK ATTACKS
Step 3a:
Some users open the attachment and their computers 
become infected with the virus.
Step 3b:
Other users do not recognize the name of the 
sender of the e-mail message. These users do
not open the e-mail message — instead they 
immediately delete the e-mail message. These 
users’ computers are not infected with the virus.
Step 2:
They use the Internet to send the
e-mail message to thousands of users 
around the world.
Step 1:
Unscrupulous programmers 
create a virus program that 
deletes all files. They hide the 
virus in a picture and attach 
the picture to an e-mail 
message.
FIGURE 10-2
HOW A VIRUS CAN SPREAD THROUGH AN E-MAIL MESSAGE
C6672_CH10_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:26 PM  Page 365

An antivirus program scans for programs that attempt to modify the boot program, the 
operating system, and other programs that normally are read from but not modified. In addition,
many antivirus programs automatically scan files downloaded from the Web, e-mail attachments,
opened files, and all removable media inserted in the computer.
One technique that antivirus programs use to identify a virus is to look for virus signatures. 
A virus signature, also called a virus definition, is a known specific pattern of virus code.
Computer users should update their antivirus program’s signature files regularly (Figure 10-3).
Updating signature files downloads any new virus definitions that have been added since the last
update. This extremely important activity allows
the antivirus program to protect against viruses
written since the antivirus program was released.
Most antivirus programs contain an automatic
update feature that regularly prompts users to
download the virus signature, usually at least once
a week. The vendor usually provides this service
to registered users at no cost for a specified time. 
If an antivirus program identifies an infected
file, it attempts to remove its virus, worm, or
Trojan horse. If the antivirus program cannot
remove the infection, it often quarantines the
infected file. A quarantine is a separate area of 
a hard disk that holds the infected file until the
infection can be removed. This step ensures other
files will not become infected. Quarantined files
remain on your computer until you delete them 
or restore them.
Some users also install a personal firewall pro-
gram to protect a computer and its data from unau-
thorized intrusion. A section later in this chapter
discusses firewalls.
Finally, stay informed about new virus alerts and
virus hoaxes. A virus hoax is an e-mail message that warns users of a nonexistent virus, worm, or
Trojan horse. Often, these virus hoaxes are in the form of a chain letter that requests the user to send
a copy of the e-mail message to as many people as possible. Instead of forwarding the message, visit
a Web site that publishes a list of virus alerts and virus hoaxes.
The list in Figure 10-4 summarizes important tips for protecting your computer from virus,
worm, and Trojan horse infections.

TIPS FOR PREVENTING VIRUS, WORM, AND TROJAN HORSE INFECTIONS
1. Never start a computer with removable media inserted in the drives or plugged in the ports, unless the media are uninfected.
2. Never open an e-mail attachment unless you are expecting it and it is from a trusted source. Turn off message preview.
3. Set the macro security in programs so that you can enable or disable macros. Enable macros only if the document is from a trusted source
and you are expecting it.
4. Install an antivirus program on all of your computers. Update the software regularly. Obtain updates to the virus signature files on a regular basis.
5. Check all downloaded programs for viruses, worms, or Trojan horses. This malware often is placed in seemingly innocent programs, so that
it will affect a large number of users.
6. If the antivirus program flags an e-mail attachment as infected, delete the attachment immediately. 
7. Before using any removable media, use the antivirus scan program to check the media for infection. Incorporate this procedure even for
shrink-wrapped software from major developers. Some commercial software has been infected and distributed to unsuspecting users this way.
8. Install a personal firewall program.
9. Stay informed about new virus alerts and virus hoaxes.
FIGURE 10-4
With the growing number of new viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, it is crucial that users take steps to protect their
computers.

important updates.
C6672_CH10_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:26 PM  Page 366

Botnets
A botnet is a group of compromised computers connected to a network such as the Internet 
that are used as part of a network that attacks other networks, usually for nefarious purposes. A
compromised computer, known as a zombie, is one whose owner is unaware the computer is being
controlled remotely by an outsider. Cybercriminals use botnets to send spam via e-mail, spread
viruses and other malware, or commit a denial of service attack.
Denial of Service Attacks
A denial of service attack, or DoS attack, is an assault whose purpose is to disrupt computer access
to an Internet service such as the Web or e-mail. Perpetrators carry out a DoS attack in a variety of
ways. For example, they may use an unsuspecting computer to send an influx of confusing data 
messages or useless traffic to a computer network. The victim computer network eventually jams,
blocking legitimate visitors from accessing the network.
Back Doors
A back door is a program or set of instructions in a program that allow users to bypass security
controls when accessing a program, computer, or network. Once perpetrators gain access to unsecure
computers, they often install a back door or modify an existing program to include a back door, which
allows them to continue to access the computer remotely without the user’s knowledge.
Spoofing
Spoofing is a technique intruders use to make their network or Internet transmission appear 
legitimate to a victim computer or network. E-mail spoofing occurs when the sender’s address or other
components of the e-mail header are altered so that it appears the e-mail originated from a different
sender. E-mail spoofing commonly is used for virus hoaxes, spam, and phishing scams. IP spoofing
occurs when an intruder computer fools a network into believing its IP address is associated with a
trusted source. Perpetrators of IP spoofing trick their victims into interacting with a phony Web site.
Safeguards against
Botnets, DoS Attacks,
Back Doors, and
Spoofing 
To defend against 
botnets, DoS attacks,
improper use of back
doors, and spoofing, users
can implement firewall
solutions and install intru-
sion detection software.
The following sections
discuss these safeguards. 
Firewalls
A firewall is hardware
and/or software that 
protects a network’s
resources from intrusion
by users on another net-
work such as the Internet
(Figure 10-5). All net-
worked and online 
computer users should
implement a firewall
solution.

C6672_CH10_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:26 PM  Page 367

Companies use firewalls to protect network resources from outsiders and to restrict employees’
access to sensitive data such as payroll or personnel records. Businesses can implement a firewall
solution themselves or outsource their needs to a company specializing in providing firewall protec-
tion. Large companies often route all their communications through a proxy server, which is a com-
ponent of the firewall. A proxy server is a server outside the company’s network that controls which
communications pass into the company’s network.
Home and small office/home office users often protect their computers with a personal firewall 
utility. A personal firewall is a utility that detects and protects a personal computer and its data from
unauthorized intrusions. Some operating systems, such as Windows Vista, include personal firewalls.
Some small office/home office users purchase a hardware firewall, such as a router or other device
that has a built-in firewall, in addition to or instead of personal firewall software. Hardware firewalls
stop intrusions before they break in your computer.
Intrusion Detection Software
To provide extra protection against hackers and other intruders, large companies sometimes use 
intrusion detection software to identify possible security breaches. Intrusion detection software
automatically analyzes all network traffic, assesses system vulnerabilities, identifies any unautho-
rized access (intrusions), and notifies network administrators of suspicious behavior patterns or
system breaches. 
To utilize intrusion detection software requires the expertise of a network administrator because the
programs are complex and difficult to use and interpret. These programs also are quite expensive. 
UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND USE
Another type of computer security risk is unauthorized access and use. Unauthorized access is the use
of a computer or network without permission. Unauthorized use is the use of a computer or its data
for unapproved or possibly illegal activities. Unauthorized use includes a variety of activities: an
employee using an organization’s computer to send personal e-mail messages, an employee using the
organization’s word processing software to track his or her child’s soccer league scores, or someone
gaining access to a bank computer and performing an unauthorized transfer. 
Safeguards against Unauthorized Access and Use
Companies take several measures to help prevent unauthorized access and use. At a minimum,
they should have a written acceptable use policy (AUP) that outlines the computer activities for
which the computer and network may and may not be used. A company’s AUP should specify the
acceptable use of computers by employees for personal reasons. Some companies prohibit such use
entirely. Others allow personal use on the employee’s own time such as a lunch hour. 
Other measures that safeguard against unauthorized access and use include firewalls and 
intrusion detection software, which were discussed in the previous section, and identifying and
authenticating users. 
Identifying and Authenticating Users
Many companies use access controls to minimize the chance that a perpetrator intentionally may
access or an employee accidentally may access confidential information on a computer. An access
control is a security measure that defines who can access a computer, when they can access it, and
what actions they can take while accessing the computer. In addition, the computer should maintain
an audit trail that records in a file both successful and unsuccessful access attempts. An unsuccessful
access attempt could result from a user mistyping his or her password, or it could result from a hacker
trying thousands of passwords. 
Companies should investigate unsuccessful access attempts immediately to ensure they are not
intentional breaches of security. They also should review successful access for irregularities, such as
use of the computer after normal working hours or from remote computers.
368
CHAPTER 10
COMPUTER SECURITY, ETHICS, AND PRIVACY
C6672_CH10_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:26 PM  Page 368

Many systems implement access controls using a two-phase process called identification and 
authentication. Identification verifies that an individual is a valid user. Authentication verifies that 
the individual is the person he or she claims to be. Three methods of identification and authentication
include user names and passwords, possessed objects, and biometric devices. The technique(s) a com-
pany uses should correspond to the degree of risk that is associated with the unauthorized access.
USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS
A user name, or user
ID (identification), is a unique combination of charac-
ters, such as letters of the alphabet or numbers, that
identifies one specific user. A password is a private
combination of characters associated with the user
name that allows access to certain computer resources.
Most multiuser (networked) operating systems
require that users correctly enter a user name and a
password before they can access the data, information,
and programs stored on a computer or network
(Figure 10-6).
Multiuser systems typically require that users select
their own passwords. Users typically choose an easy-
to-remember word or series of characters for pass-
words. If your password is too obvious, however, such
as your initials or birthday, others can guess it easily.
Easy passwords make it simple for hackers and other
intruders to break into a system. Hackers use com-
puter automated tools to assist them with guessing
passwords. Thus, you should select a password care-
fully. Longer passwords provide greater security than
shorter ones. Each character added to a password sig-
nificantly increases the number of possible combinations and the length of time it might take for 
someone or for a hacker’s computer to guess the password (Figure 10-7). 
Some Web sites use a CAPTCHA to further protect a user's password. A CAPTCHA, which stands
for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, is a program that
verifies user input is not computer generated. A CAPTCHA displays a series of distorted characters
and requires the user to enter the characters correctly to continue using the Web site.

Many Web sites that maintain personal and confidential
data require a user to enter a user name and password.

This table shows the 
effect of increasing the
length of a password that

numbers. The longer the
password, the more effort
required to discover it.
Long passwords, however,

to remember.

In addition to a user name and password, some systems ask users to enter one of several pieces of
personal information. Such items can include a spouse’s first name, a birth date, a place of birth, or a
mother’s maiden name. As with a password, if the user’s response does not match the information
on file, the system denies access.
POSSESSED OBJECTS
A possessed object is any item that you must carry to gain access to a 
computer or computer facility. Examples of possessed objects are badges, cards, smart cards, and
keys. The card you use in an automated teller machine (ATM) is a possessed object that allows
access to your bank account.
Possessed objects often are used in combination with personal identification numbers. A personal
identification number (PIN) is a numeric password, either assigned by a company or selected by a
user. PINs provide an additional level of security. An ATM card typically requires a four-digit PIN.
PINs are passwords. Select them carefully and
protect them as you do any other password.
BIOMETRIC DEVICES
A biometric device
authenticates a person’s identity by translating a
personal characteristic, such as a fingerprint,
into a digital code that is then compared with a
digital code stored in the computer verifying a
physical or behavioral characteristic. If the digi-
tal code in the computer does not match the
personal characteristic code, the computer
denies access to the individual. 
Biometric devices grant access to programs, 
computers, or rooms using computer analysis of
some biometric identifier. Examples of biomet-
ric devices and systems include fingerprint read-
ers (Figure 10-8), hand geometry systems, face
recognition systems, voice verification systems,
signature verification systems, iris recognition
systems, and retinal scanners. Many grocery
stores, retail stores, and gas stations now use
biometric payment, where the customer’s fin-
gerprint is read by a fingerprint reader that is
linked to a specific payment method such as a
checking account or credit card. Read Looking
Ahead 10-1 for a look at biometric software.

Biometric Software Aids Behavior Detection
Security experts use a technique called behavior detection to recognize suspicious 
behavior. These specially trained personnel study a person’s body language, facial 
expressions, and speech for specific patterns that criminals commonly exhibit and then
alert crime prevention specialists when something looks awry.
IBM has developed a Smart Surveillance System that enhances the security experts’
visual checks. It analyzes video footage shot at various locations for specific uncontrol-
lable actions and spoken words. Airports are prime locations for the biometric software
as are large urban cities. Chicago already is testing the system.
The Smart Surveillance System project is in its infancy as programmers are attempt-
ing to teach the computers to recognize microexpressions, which are the split-second
emotions lasting one-fifteenth of a second, on peoples’ faces. In the far-distant future,
experts predict the software will detect these actions and behaviors automatically. For

HARDWARE THEFT AND VANDALISM
HARDWARE THEFT AND VANDALISM
Hardware theft and vandalism are other types of computer security risks. Hardware theft is the 
act of stealing computer equipment. Hardware vandalism is the act of defacing or destroying com-
puter equipment. Hardware vandalism takes many forms, from someone cutting a computer cable to
individuals breaking into a business or school computer lab and aimlessly smashing computers.
Mobile users are susceptible to hardware theft. It is estimated that more than two million notebook
computers are stolen each year. The size and weight of these computers make them easy to steal.
Thieves often target notebook computers of company executives, so that they can use the stolen com-
puter to access confidential company information illegally. In this case, hardware theft is combined
with software and information theft.
Safeguards against Hardware Theft and Vandalism
To help reduce the chances of theft, companies and schools use a
variety of security measures. Physical access controls, such as locked
doors and windows, usually are adequate to protect the equipment.
Many businesses, schools, and some homeowners install alarm sys-
tems for additional security. School computer labs and other areas
with a large number of semifrequent users often attach additional
physical security devices such as cables that lock the equipment to a
desk (Figure 10-9), cabinet, or floor. Small locking devices also exist
that require a key to access a hard disk or CD/DVD drive.
Some businesses use a real time location system (RTLS) to track
and identify the location of high-risk or high-value items. One imple-
mentation of RTLS places RFID tags in items to be tracked.
Mobile computer users must take special care to protect their equip-
ment. Some users attach a physical device such as a cable to lock a
mobile computer temporarily to a stationary object. Other mobile users
install a mini-security system in the notebook computer. Some of these
security systems shut down the computer and sound an alarm if the computer moves outside a
specified distance. Notebook computer security systems and tracking software can track the location
of a stolen notebook computer.
Some notebook computers use passwords, possessed objects, and biometrics as methods 
of security. When you start these computers, you must enter a password, slide a card in a card
reader, or press your finger on a fingerprint reader before the hard disk unlocks. This type of
security does not prevent theft, but it renders the computer useless if it is stolen.

SOFTWARE THEFT
Another type of computer security risk is software theft. Software theft occurs when someone steals
software media, intentionally erases programs, or illegally copies a program. One form of software theft
involves someone physically stealing the media that contain the software or the hardware that contains the
media, as described in the previous section. Another form of software theft occurs when software is stolen
from software manufacturers. This type of theft, called piracy, is by far the most common form of software
theft. Software piracy is the unauthorized and illegal duplication of copyrighted software.
Safeguards against Software Theft
To protect software media from being stolen, owners should keep original software boxes and media in
a secure location. All computer users should back up their files and disks regularly, in the event of theft.
To protect themselves from software piracy, software manufacturers issue users license agreements. 
A license agreement is the right to use the software. That is, you do not own the software. The license
agreement provides specific conditions for use of the software, which a user must accept before using
the software (Figure 10-10). These terms usually are displayed when you install the software. 
The most common type of license included with software purchased by individual users is a single-
user license agreement, also called an end-user license agreement (EULA). A single-user license agree-
ment typically includes many of the following conditions that specify a user’s responsibility upon
acceptance of the agreement. 
Users are permitted to:
• Install the software on only one computer. (Some license agreements allow users to install the
software on one desktop computer and one notebook computer.)
• Make one copy of the software as a backup.
• Give or sell the software to another individual, but only
if the software is removed from the user’s computer
first.
Users are not permitted to:
• Install the software on a network, such as a school
computer lab.
• Give copies to friends and colleagues, while continuing
to use the software.
• Export the software.
• Rent or lease the software.
Unless otherwise specified by a license agreement, you
do not have the right to copy, loan, borrow, rent, or in any
way distribute software. Doing so is a violation of copy-
right law. It also is a federal crime. Despite this, some
experts estimate for every authorized copy of software 
in use, at least one unauthorized copy exists.
In an attempt to prevent software piracy, Microsoft 
and other manufacturers have incorporated an activation
process into many of its consumer products. During the
product activation, which is conducted either online 
or by telephone, users provide the software product’s 
25-character identification number to receive an installa-
tion identification number unique to the computer on
which the software is installed.
If you are not completely familiar with your school or
employer’s policies governing installation of software,
check with the information technology department or
your school’s technology coordinator.

INFORMATION THEFT
Information theft is yet another type of computer security risk. Information theft occurs when
someone steals personal or confidential information. An unethical company executive may steal
or buy stolen information to learn about a competitor. A corrupt individual may steal credit card
numbers to make fraudulent purchases. 
Safeguards against Information Theft
Most companies attempt to prevent information theft by implementing the user identification
and authentication controls discussed earlier in this chapter. These controls are best suited for
protecting information on computers located on a company’s premises. Information transmitted
over networks offers a higher degree of risk because unscrupulous users can intercept it during
transmission. To protect information on the Internet and networks, companies and individuals
use a variety of encryption techniques.
Encryption
Encryption is the process of converting readable data into unreadable characters to prevent
unauthorized access. You treat encrypted data just like any other data. That is, you can store it 
or send it in an e-mail message. To read the data, the recipient must decrypt, or decipher, it into 
a readable form.
In the encryption process, the unencrypted, readable data is called plaintext. The encrypted
(scrambled) data is called ciphertext. To encrypt the data, the originator of the data converts the
plaintext into ciphertext using an encryption key. In its simplest form, an encryption key is a 
programmed formula that the recipient of the data uses to decrypt ciphertext. 
Many data encryption methods exist. Figure 10-11 shows examples of some simple encryption
methods. An encryption key (formula) often uses more than one of these methods, such as a combi-
nation of transposition and substitution. Most organizations use available software for encryption.
Windows Vista enables you easily to encrypt the contents of files, folders, and drives.

WEB LINK 10-5
When users send an e-mail message over the Internet, they never know who might intercept 
it, who might read it, or to whom it might be forwarded. If a message contains personal or confi-
dential information, users can protect the message by encrypting it or signing it digitally. One 
of the more popular e-mail encryption programs is called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). PGP is
freeware for personal, noncommercial users. Home users can download PGP from the Web at 
no cost.
A digital signature is an encrypted code that a person, Web site, or company attaches to an
electronic message to verify the identity of the message sender. Digital signatures often are 
used to ensure that an impostor is not participating in an Internet transaction. That is, digital 
signatures help to prevent e-mail forgery. A digital signature also can verify that the content of a
message has not changed.
Many Web browsers and Web sites use encryp-
tion. A Web site that uses encryption techniques 
to secure its data is known as a secure site (Figure
10-12). Secure sites often use digital certificates. 
A digital certificate is a notice that guarantees a
user or a Web site is legitimate. A certificate
authority (CA) is an authorized person or a com-
pany that issues and verifies digital certificates.
Users apply for a digital certificate from a CA.
The digital certificate typically contains informa-
tion such as the user’s name, the issuing CA’s
name and signature, and the serial number of the
certificate. The information in a digital certificate
is encrypted.
SYSTEM FAILURE
System failure is yet another type of computer
security risk. A system failure is the prolonged
malfunction of a computer. System failure can
cause loss of hardware, software, data, or infor-
mation. A variety of causes can lead to system
failure. These include aging hardware; natural
disasters such as fires, floods, or hurricanes; ran-
dom events such as electrical power problems; and even errors in computer programs.
One of the more common causes of system failure is an electrical power variation. Electrical
power variations can cause loss of data and loss of equipment. If the computer equipment is 
networked, a single power disturbance can damage multiple systems. 
Safeguards against System Failure
To protect against electrical power variations, use a surge protector. 
A surge protector uses special electrical components to provide a 
stable current flow to the computer and other electronic equip-
ment (Figure 10-13). Sometimes resembling a power strip, 
the computer and other devices plug in the surge 
protector, which plugs in the power source. 
FIGURE 10-12

Web page
C6672_CH10_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:26 PM  Page 374

No surge protectors are 100 percent effective. Typically, the amount of protection offered by 
a surge protector is proportional to its cost. That is, the more expensive, the more protection the 
protector offers.
If your computer connects to a network or the Internet, also be sure
to have protection for your modem, telephone lines, DSL lines,
Internet cable lines, and network lines. Many surge protectors include
plug-ins for telephone lines and other cables. 
For additional electrical protection, some applications connect an
uninterruptible power supply to the computer. An uninterruptible
power supply (UPS) is a device that contains surge protection circuits
and one or more batteries that can provide power during a loss of
power (Figure 10-14). A UPS connects between your computer and a
power source. 
As another measure of protection, some companies use duplicate
components or computers as a safeguard against system failure. 
BACKING UP — THE ULTIMATE SAFEGUARD
To prevent against data loss caused by a system failure or hardware/
software/information theft, computer users should back up files regularly. A backup is a duplicate
of a file, program, or disk that can be used if the original is lost, damaged, or destroyed. Thus, to
back up a file means to make a copy of it. In the case of a system failure or the discovery of cor-
rupted files, you restore the files by copying the backed up files to their original location on the
computer.
You can use just about any media to store backups. A good choice for a home user might be 
CD-RWs or DVD+RWs. Keep backup copies in a fireproof and heatproof safe or vault, or offsite.
Offsite means in a location separate from the computer site. A growing trend is to use online stor-
age as an offsite location. Recall that online storage is a service on the Web that provides storage 
to computer users.
Most backup programs for the home user provide for a full backup and a selective backup. A full
backup copies all of the files in the computer. With a selective backup, users choose which folders
and files to include in a backup.
Some users implement a three-generation backup policy to preserve three copies of important 
files. The grandparent is the oldest copy of the file. The parent is the second oldest copy of the file.
The child is the most recent copy of the file.
Most operating systems include a backup program. Backup devices, such as tape and removable
disk drives, also include backup programs. Numerous stand-alone backup utilities exist. Many of
these can be downloaded from the Web at no cost. 
Some companies choose to use an online backup service to handle their backup needs. An 
online backup service is a Web site that automatically backs up files to its online location. These
sites usually charge a monthly or annual fee. If the system crashes, the online backup service 
typically sends the company one or more CD/DVDs that contains all its backed up data.
WIRELESS SECURITY
Wireless technology has made dramatic changes in the way computer users communicate 
worldwide. Billions of home and business users have notebook computers, smart phones, and other
personal mobile devices to access the Internet, send e-mail and instant messages, chat online, or
share network connections — all without wires. Home users set up wireless home networks. Mobile
users access wireless networks in hot spots at airports, hotels, schools, shopping malls, bookstores,
restaurants, and coffee shops. Schools have wireless networks so that students can access the school
network using their mobile computers and devices as they move from building to building.

Although wireless access provides many conveniences to users, it also poses additional security
risks. One study showed that about 80 percent of wireless networks have no security protection.
Some perpetrators connect to other’s wireless networks to gain free Internet access; others may
try to access a company’s confidential data.
To access the network, the individual must be in range of the wireless network. Some intruders
intercept and monitor communications as they transmit through the air. Others connect to a net-
work through an unsecured wireless access point (WAP). In one technique, called war driving,
individuals attempt to detect wireless networks via their notebook computer while driving a
vehicle through areas they suspect have a wireless network. 
In addition to using firewalls, some safeguards that improve the security of wireless networks
include reconfiguring the wireless access point and ensuring equipment uses one or more wire-
less security standards such as Wi-Fi Protected Access and 802.11i.
• A wireless access point (WAP) should be configured so that it does not broadcast a network
name. The WAP also can be programmed so that only certain devices can access it.
• Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a security standard that improves on older security standards
by authenticating network users and providing more advanced encryption techniques.
• An 802.11i network, the most recent network security standard, conforms to the government’s
security standards and uses more sophisticated encryption techniques than WPA.
By implementing these security measures, you can help to prevent unauthorized access to 
wireless networks.

COMPUTER SECURITY, ETHICS, AND PRIVACY
ETHICS AND SOCIETY
As with any powerful technology, computers can be used for both good and bad intentions. 
The standards that determine whether an action is good or bad are known as ethics.
Computer ethics are the moral guidelines that govern the use of computers and information
systems. Five frequently discussed areas of computer ethics are unauthorized use of computers
and networks, software theft (piracy), information accuracy, intellectual property rights, and
information privacy. The questionnaire in Figure 10-15 raises issues in each of these areas.
Previous sections in this chapter discussed unauthorized use of computers and networks, 
and software theft (piracy). The following pages discuss issues related to information accuracy,
intellectual property rights, and information privacy.

Information Accuracy
Information accuracy today is a concern because many users access information maintained by
other people or companies, such as on the Internet. Do not assume that because the information
is on the Web that it is correct. Users should evaluate the value of a Web page before relying on
its content. Be aware that the company providing access to the information may not be the creator
of the information.

CHAPTER 10
COMPUTER SECURITY, ETHICS, AND PRIVACY
Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual property (IP) refers to unique and original works such as ideas, inventions, art,
writings, processes, company and product names, and logos. Intellectual property rights are the
rights to which creators are entitled for their work. Certain issues arise surrounding IP today
because many of these works are available digitally. 
A copyright gives authors and artists exclusive rights to duplicate, publish, and sell their 
materials. A copyright protects any tangible form of expression.
A common infringement of copyright is piracy. People pirate (illegally copy) software, movies,
and music. Many areas are not clear-cut with respect to the law, because copyright law gives the
public fair use to copyrighted material. The issues surround the phrase, fair use, which allows use
for educational and critical purposes. 
This vague definition is subject to widespread interpretation and raises many questions:
• Should individuals be able to download contents of your Web site, modify it, and then put it on
the Web again as their own?
• Should a faculty member have the right to print material from the Web and distribute it to all
members of the class for teaching purposes only?
• Should someone be able to scan photos or pages from a book, publish them to the Web, and
allow others to download them?
• Should students be able to post term papers they have written on the Web, making it tempting
for other students to download and submit them as their own work?
These issues with copyright law led to the development of digital rights management (DRM),
a strategy designed to prevent illegal distribution of movies, music, and other digital content.

In addition to concerns about the accuracy of computer input, some individuals and organizations
raise questions about the ethics of using computers to alter output, primarily graphical output such
as retouched photos. Using graphics equipment and software, users easily can digitize photos and
then add, change, or remove images (Figure 10-16).
One group that completely opposes any manipulation of an image is the National Press 
Photographers Association. It believes that allowing even the slightest alteration could lead to 
misrepresentative photos. Others believe that digital photo retouching is acceptable as long as the
significant content or meaning of the photo does not change. Digital retouching is an area in which
legal precedents so far have not been established.

INFORMATION PRIVACY
INFORMATION PRIVACY
Information privacy refers to the right of individuals and companies to deny or restrict the 
collection and use of information about them. In the past, information privacy was easier to main-
tain because information was kept in separate locations. Each retail store had its own credit files.
Each government agency maintained separate records. Doctors had their own patient files.
Today, huge databases store this data online. Much of the data is personal and confidential 
and should be accessible only to authorized users. Many individuals and organizations, however,
question whether this data really is private. 
Figure 10-17 lists measures you can take to make your personal data private. The following
pages address techniques companies and employers use to collect your personal data.
HOW TO SAFEGUARD PERSONAL INFORMATION
FIGURE 10-17
Techniques to keep personal data private.
1. Fill in only necessary information on rebate, warranty, and 
registration forms.
2. Do not preprint your telephone number or Social Security 
number on personal checks.

numbers, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license 
numbers on the back of your personal checks.
7. Purchase goods with cash, rather than credit or checks.
8. Avoid shopping club and buyer cards.
9. If merchants ask personal questions, find out why they want to
know before releasing the information.
10. Inform merchants that you do not want them to distribute your
personal information.
11. Request, in writing, to be removed from mailing lists.
12. Obtain your credit report once a year from each of the three
major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and
TransUnion) and correct any errors.
13. Request a free copy of your medical records once a year from
the Medical Information Bureau.
14. Limit the amount of information you provide to Web sites. 
Fill in only required information.
15. Install a cookie manager to filter cookies.
16. Clear your history file when you are finished browsing.
17. Set up a free e-mail account. Use this e-mail address for 
merchant forms.
18. Turn off file and printer sharing on your Internet connection.
19. Install a personal firewall.
20. Sign-up for e-mail filtering through your Internet access
provider or use an anti-spam program such as Brightmail.
21. Do not reply to spam for any reason.
22. Surf the Web anonymously with a program such as Freedom
WebSecure or through an anonymous Web site such as
Anonymizer.com.
Is It Illegal to Delete Some Files from Your Own Computer?
Recently, a man was sued by a company that distributes discount coupons on its Web site because he found a method that allowed him to
print more than two copies of each coupon. He then notified others how to do the same. The company placed files and other information on
each of the Web site’s users’ computers that helped to enforce a policy of allowing a person to print two copies of each coupon. By changing
these files, the man was able to print more than two copies of a coupon.
The company sued the man because it claimed that he violated a provision of the law known as the DMCA, or Digital Millennium Copyright
Act. One provision of the law states that a person cannot circumvent technology intended to protect another’s intellectual property. In this
case, the circumvention was the man’s deletion and changing of files on his computer, and the intellectual property included copied coupons.
Many legal scholars argue that the company took an overly broad view of the law. Others claim the law is vague and, in fact, does appear 
to apply in this situation. Should you legally be prohibited from deleting or changing files on your own computer? Why or why not? Would
you delete files on your computer in order to print more coupons than allowed by a company’s policy? Why or why not? What sort of
common-sense laws can the government enact that could avoid these types of situations?

Electronic Profiles
When you fill out a form such as a magazine subscription, product warranty registration card,
or contest entry form, the merchant that receives the form usually enters it into a database.
Likewise, every time you click an advertisement on the Web or register software online, your
information and preferences enter a database. Merchants then sell the contents of their databases
to national marketing firms and Internet advertising firms. By combining this data with informa-
tion from public sources such as driver’s licenses and vehicle registrations, these firms create an
electronic profile of individuals. 
Critics contend that the information in an electronic profile reveals more about an individual
than anyone has a right to know. They also claim that companies should inform people if they
plan to provide personal information to others. Many companies today allow people to specify
whether they want their personal information distributed.
Cookies
E-commerce and other Web applications often rely on cookies to identify users. A cookie is a
small text file that a Web server stores on your computer. Cookie files typically contain data about
you, such as your user name or viewing preferences. 
Many commercial Web sites send a cookie to your browser, and then your computer’s hard
disk stores the cookie. The next time you visit the Web site, your browser retrieves the cookie
from your hard disk and sends the data in the cookie to the Web site. Figure 10-18 illustrates how
Web sites work with cookies.
Step 1:
When you type the Web address of a Web 
site in your browser window, the browser 
program searches your hard disk for a 
cookie associated with the Web site.
Step 2:
If the browser finds 
a cookie, it sends 
information in the 
cookie file to the 
Web site.
Step 3:
If the Web site does not receive cookie information, and is 
expecting it, the site creates an identification number for you in 
its database and sends that number to your browser. The browser 
in turn creates a cookie file based on that number and stores 
the cookie file on your hard disk. The Web site now can update 
information in the cookie file whenever you access the site.

HOW COOKIES WORK
C6672_CH10_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:26 PM  Page 380

Web sites use cookies for a variety of purposes:
• Most Web sites that allow for personalization use cookies to track user preferences. On such
sites, users may be asked to fill in a form requesting personal information, such as their name,
postal code, or site preferences. A news Web site, for example, might allow users to customize
their viewing preferences to display certain stock quotes. The Web site stores their preferences 
in a cookie on the users’ hard disks.
• Some Web sites use cookies to store users’ passwords, so that they do not need to enter it every
time they log in to the Web site.
• Online shopping sites generally use a session cookie to keep track of items in a user’s shopping
cart. This way, users can start an order during one Web session and finish it on another day in
another session. Session cookies usually expire after a certain time, such as a week or a month.
• Some Web sites use cookies to track how regularly users visit a site and the Web pages they
visit while at the site.
• Web sites may use cookies to target advertisements. These sites store a user’s interests and
browsing habits in the cookie.
You can set your browser to accept cookies automatically, prompt you if you want to accept a
cookie, or disable cookie use altogether. Keep in mind if you disable cookie use, you will not be
able to use many of the e-commerce Web sites. 
Spyware and Adware
Spyware is a program placed on a computer without the user’s knowledge that secretly collects
information about the user. Spyware can enter a computer as a virus or as a result of a user
installing a new program. The spyware program communicates information it collects to some 
outside source while you are online.
Some vendors or employers use spyware to collect information about program usage or
employees. Internet advertising firms often collect information about users’ Web browsing habits
by hiding spyware in adware. Adware is a program that displays an online advertisement in a
banner or pop-up window on Web pages, e-mail messages, or other Internet services. To remove
spyware and adware, you can obtain a spyware and adware remover that can detect and delete
spyware and adware. Some operating systems and Web browsers include spyware removers. Read
Ethics & Issues 10-2 for a related discussion.
381
INFORMATION PRIVACY
Phishing
Phishing is a scam in which a perpetrator sends an official looking e-mail message that
attempts to obtain your personal and financial information. Some phishing e-mail messages ask
you to reply with your information; others direct you to a phony Web site, or a pop-up window
that looks like a Web site, that collects the information. 
Should Spyware Be Legal?
Legitimate businesses and illegitimate hackers use a variety of techniques to secretly install spyware on unsecured
computers. Spyware can perform a number of tasks, such as monitoring the Web sites that a person visits or con-
trolling a computer remotely. Some Web pages also have cookies that count visitors and gather basic statistical
information about a visitor’s location and Web browser. Online advertising agencies or Internet access providers
frequently place spyware cookies as part of a promotion, sometimes without the knowledge of the Web page’s
sponsor. When the collected information is stored in a Web database and shared among several sites, the techno-
logy can track a visitor’s travels around the Web. If a visitor completes a registration, that information also can be
distributed to other advertisers. Spyware and cookies help advertisers reach their markets and refine their mes-
sages, but opponents say the technology is little more than electronic stalking. Legal experts say that the use of
spyware is in a legal gray area, and stronger laws are needed to regulate it. Should spyware and/or cookies be
banned, or is it the right of Web page owners and advertisers to collect information about visitors? Why? Should
Web page authors and/or Web page visitors be made aware of spyware and cookies? Why or why not?

If you receive an e-mail that looks legitimate and requests you update credit card numbers,
Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, passwords, or other private information, the 
FTC recommends you visit the Web site directly to determine if the request is valid. Never click 
a link in an e-mail message; instead retype the Web address in your browser.
A phishing filter is a program that warns or blocks you from potentially fraudulent or 
suspicious Web sites. Some Web browsers include phishing filters.
Pharming is a scam, similar to phishing, where a perpetrator attempts to obtain your personal
and financial information, except they do so via spoofing. That is, when you type a Web address
in the Web browser, you are redirected to a phony Web site that looks legitimate. The phony Web
site requests you enter confidential information.
Spam
Spam is an unsolicited e-mail message or newsgroup posting sent to multiple recipients or
newsgroups at once. Spam is Internet junk mail (Figure 10-19). The content of spam ranges 
from selling a product or service, to promoting a business opportunity, to advertising offensive
material. One study indicates the average user receives more than 2,200 spam e-mail messages
each year.
Users can reduce the amount of spam they receive
with a number of techniques. Some e-mail programs
have built-in settings that allow users to delete spam
automatically. Users also can sign up for e-mail filtering
from their Internet access provider. E-mail filtering is a
service that blocks e-mail messages from designated
sources. An alternative to e-mail filtering is to purchase
an anti-spam program that attempts to remove spam
before it reaches your inbox. The disadvantage of e-mail
filters and anti-spam programs is that sometimes they
remove valid e-mail messages. Thus, users should
review the contents of the spam messages periodically
to ensure they do not contain valid messages.

Privacy Laws
The concern about privacy has led to the enactment of federal and state laws regarding the 
storage and disclosure of personal data (Figure 10-20). 
Common points in some of these laws include the following:
1. Information collected and stored about individuals should be limited to what is necessary to
carry out the function of the business or government agency collecting the data.
2. Once collected, provisions should be made to restrict access to the data to those employees
within the organization who need access to it to perform their job duties.
3. Personal information should be released outside the organization collecting the data only
when the person has agreed to its disclosure.
4. When information is collected about an individual, the individual should know that the data
is being collected and have the opportunity to determine the accuracy of the data.

Social Engineering
As related to the use of computers, social engineering is defined as gaining unauthorized access
or obtaining confidential information by taking advantage of the trusting human nature of some
victims and the naivety of others. Some social engineers trick their victims into revealing confiden-
tial information such as user names and passwords on the telephone, in person, or on the Internet.
Techniques they use include pretending to be an administrator or other authoritative figure, feigning
an emergency situation, or impersonating an acquaintance. Social engineers also obtain information
from users who do not destroy or conceal information properly. These perpetrators sift through com-
pany dumpsters, watch or film people dialing telephone numbers or using ATMs, and snoop around
computers looking for openly displayed confidential information.
Employee Monitoring
Employee monitoring involves the use of computers to observe, record, and review an employee’s
use of a computer, including communications such as e-mail messages, keyboard activity (used to
measure productivity), and Web sites visited. Many programs exist that easily allow employers
to monitor employees. Further, it is legal for employers to use these programs.
A frequently debated issue is whether an employer has the right to read employee e-mail mes-
sages. Actual policies vary widely. Some companies declare that they will review e-mail messages
regularly, and others state that e-mail is private. In some states, if a company does not have a for-
mal e-mail policy, it can read e-mail messages without employee notification. Several lawsuits
have been filed against employers because many believe that such internal communications
should be private. 
Another controversial issue relates to the use of cameras to monitor employees, customers, and
the public. Many people feel that this use of video cameras is a violation of privacy. 
Content Filtering
One of the more controversial issues that surround the Internet is its widespread availability of
objectionable material, such as racist literature, violence, and obscene pictures. Some believe that
such materials should be banned. Others believe that the materials should be filtered, that is,
restricted. Content filtering is the process of restricting access to certain material on the Web.
Content filtering opponents argue that banning any materials violates constitutional guarantees
of free speech and personal rights. 
Many businesses use content filtering to limit employees’ Web access. These businesses 
argue that employees are unproductive when visiting inappropriate or objectionable Web 
sites. Some schools, libraries,
and parents use content 
filtering to restrict access to
minors.
Web filtering software is 
a program that restricts
access to specified Web sites.
Some also filter sites that 
use specific words. Others
allow you to filter e-mail
messages, chat rooms, and
programs. Many Internet
security programs include 
a firewall, antivirus program,
and filtering capabilities 
combined (Figure 10-21).

Computer Forensics
Computer forensics, also called digital forensics, network forensics, or cyberforensics, is the
discovery, collection, and analysis of evidence found on computers and networks. Forensic analysis
involves the examination of computer media, programs, data and log files on computers, servers,
and networks. Many areas use computer forensics, including law enforcement, criminal prosecutors,
military intelligence, insurance agencies, and information security departments in the private sector.
A computer forensics analyst must have knowledge of the law, technical experience with many
types of hardware and software products, superior communication skills, familiarity with corpo-
rate structures and policies, a willingness to learn and update skills, and a knack for problem
solving. For a look at the next generation of forensics, read Looking Ahead 10-2.
HEALTH CONCERNS OF COMPUTER USE
Users are a key component in any information system. Thus, protecting users is just as important
as protecting hardware, software, and data. 
The widespread use of computers has led to some important health concerns. The following
sections discuss health risks and preventions, along with measures users can take to keep the
environment healthy.
Computers and Health Risks
A repetitive strain injury (RSI) is an injury or disorder of the muscles, nerves,
tendons, ligaments, and joints. Computer-related RSIs include tendonitis and
carpal tunnel syndrome. RSIs are the largest job-related injury and illness 
problem in the United States today. 
Tendonitis is inflammation of a tendon due to some repeated motion or stress
on that tendon. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is inflammation of the nerve that
connects the forearm to the palm of the wrist. Repeated or forceful bending of the
wrist can cause CTS or tendonitis of the wrist. Symptoms of tendonitis of the wrist
include extreme pain that extends from the forearm to the hand, along with tin-
gling in the fingers. Symptoms of CTS include burning pain when the nerve is
compressed, along with numbness and tingling in the thumb and first two fingers.
Long-term computer work can lead to tendonitis or CTS. Factors that cause
these disorders include prolonged typing, prolonged mouse usage, or continual
shifting between the mouse and the keyboard. If untreated, these disorders can
lead to permanent damage to your body.
You can take many precautions to prevent these types of injuries. Take frequent
breaks during the computer session to exercise your hands and arms (Figure 
10-22). To prevent injury due to typing, place a wrist rest between the keyboard
and the edge of your desk. To prevent injury while using a mouse, place the
mouse at least six inches from the edge of the desk. In this position, your wrist is
flat on the desk. Finally, minimize the number of times you switch between the
mouse and the keyboard, and avoid using the heel of your hand as a pivot point
while typing or using the mouse.
385
HEALTH CONCERNS OF COMPUTER USE
HAND EXERCISES
•
Spread fingers apart for several seconds
while keeping wrists straight.
•
Gently push back fingers and then thumb.
•
Dangle arms loosely at sides and then 
shake arms and hands.

developing tendonitis or carpal tunnel syndrome,
take frequent breaks during computer sessions to

Computer Knowledge Assessment Using Brain Fingerprinting
A powerful forensic tool may one day replace the traditional lie detector test. Brain fingerprinting examines a subset
of brain waves generated involuntarily when an individual recognizes familiar information.
To conduct the test, researchers place a strap equipped with sensors on an individual’s head and then present a
variety of relevant and irrelevant words, pictures, and sounds. If the stimulus is familiar, the brain generates unique
brain waves 300 to 800 milliseconds after receiving the stimulus.
Computers store and then analyze the series of unique brain waves to determine if the person’s brain has stored criti-
cal details of a situation, such as a fraudulent or criminal act. Researchers also have determined that brain fingerprinting
could help identify the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch10/looking and then click Brain Fingerprinting.

C6672_CH10_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:26 PM  Page 385

Another type of health-related condition due to computer usage is computer vision syndrome
(CVS). You may have CVS if you have sore, tired, burning, itching, or dry eyes; blurred or double
vision; distance blurred vision after prolonged staring at a display device; headache or sore neck;
difficulty shifting focus between a display device and documents; difficulty focusing on the
screen image; color fringes or after-images when you look away from the display device; and
increased sensitivity to light. Eyestrain associated with CVS is not thought to have serious or
long-term consequences. Figure 10-23 outlines some techniques you can follow to ease eyestrain.
People who spend their workday using the computer
sometimes complain of lower back pain, muscle fatigue,
and emotional fatigue. Lower back pain sometimes is
caused from poor posture. Always sit properly in the
chair while you work. Take a break every 30 to 60 
minutes — stand up, walk around, or stretch. Another
way to help prevent these injuries is to be sure your
workplace is designed ergonomically. 
Ergonomics and Workplace Design
Ergonomics is an applied science devoted to 
incorporating comfort, efficiency, and safety into 
the design of items in the workplace. Ergonomic
studies have shown that using the correct type and
configuration of chair, keyboard, display device, 
and work surface helps users work comfortably 
and efficiently and helps protect their health. For 
the computer work space, experts recommend an
area of at least two feet by four feet. Figure 10-24
illustrates additional guidelines for setting up the
work area.

Computer Addiction
Computers can provide entertainment and enjoyment. Some computer users, however, 
become obsessed with the computer and the Internet. Computer addiction occurs when 
the computer consumes someone’s entire social life. Computer addiction is a growing 
health problem. Symptoms of a user with computer addiction include the following:
• Craves computer time
• Overjoyed when at the computer
• Unable to stop computer activity
• Irritable when not at the computer
• Neglects family and friends
• Problems at work or school
Computer addiction is a treatable illness through therapy and support groups.
Green Computing
Green computing involves reducing the electricity and environmental waste while using a 
computer. People use, and often waste, resources such as electricity and paper while using a 
computer. 
Experts estimate that more than 700 million personal computers are obsolete. Because of the
huge volumes of electronic waste, the U.S. federal government has proposed a bill that would
require computer recycling across the country. Local governments are working on methods to
make it easy for consumers to recycle this type of equipment.
To reduce the environmental impact of computing further, users simply can alter a few habits.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter identified some potential computer risks and the safeguards that schools, 
businesses, and individuals can implement to minimize these risks. Wireless security risks 
and safeguards also were discussed. Read Ethics & Issues 10-3 for a related discussion.
The chapter presented ethical issues surrounding information accuracy, intellectual property

issues, their preventions, and ways to keep the environment healthy.
Computer Forensics Specialist
Computer forensics is a rapidly growing field that involves gathering and 
analyzing evidence from computers and networks. It is the responsibility of 
the computer forensics specialist to take several careful steps to identify 
and retrieve possible evidence that may exist on a suspect’s computer. These 
steps include protecting the suspect’s computer, discovering all files, recov-
ering deleted files, revealing hidden files, accessing protected or encrypted files, 
analyzing all the data, and providing expert consultation and/or testimony as required. A computer forensics
specialist must have knowledge of all aspects of the computer, from the operating system to computer
architecture and hardware design.
In the past, many computer forensics specialists were self-taught computer users who may have attended
computer forensics seminars, or they may have been trained in the use of one or more computer forensics
tools by software vendors. The computer forensics specialist of today needs extensive training, usually from
several different sources. A degree in Computer Science should be supplemented with graduate courses and
university level professional development certificates. The most widely recognized certifications available to
computer forensics professionals are the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and
the Certified Computer Examiner (CCE). The CCE is offered by the International Society for Computer
Examiners (ISFCE), an organization created to maintain high standards for computer examiners.
Entry level salaries for computer forensics specialists range from $90,000 to $125,000. With experience
and certifications, salaries can exceed $170,000. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch10/careers

What Can Be Done to Stop the Growing Threat of Cybercrime?
By some estimates, cybercrime has become a worldwide criminal industry that involves more than $100 billion 
in illegal trade, which surpasses the illicit drug trade. Cybercrime includes online or Internet-based illegal acts.
Some believe that the total cost of cybercrime to individuals and organizations may exceed a half trillion dollars.
Furthermore, perhaps only five percent of those committing cybercrimes are caught. Legendary fraudster Frank
Abagnale, whose criminal exploits 40 years ago involved forgery and impersonation, claims that, due to advances
in technology, it is now 4,000 times easier to do what he did back then. Some people feel that cybercrime simply
represents an evolution in criminal techniques and that any attempt to fight it only will result in the techniques
evolving into more sophisticated methods. While no government agency has declared a war on cybercrime, many
feel that it is time to raise awareness of this troubling issue. How can the cybercrime problem best be handled?
Why? Why do you think that cybercrime might not be taken as seriously as other criminal problems? What might
be the effects on society and the Internet if cybercrime is left largely unchecked? How would you know if you are a
victim of cybercrime, and if you were, what could you do about it?

systems for suspicious messages and expect to find more than 18,000 new threats
each year.
More than 120 million consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses, governmen-
tal agencies, and large corporations rely on McAfee’s intrusion prevention products to
shield them from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware and adware, and phishing
schemes. In 2007, the Computing Technology Industry Association named McAfee

Norton products, including AntiVirus, Internet Security, and AntiSpam, can provide
these users with peace of mind knowing that their computers are as secure as possible.
Gordon Eubank founded Symantec in 1982. Since then, more than 120 million
users worldwide have used that company’s products, helping it grow to one of the
world’s premier Internet security technology companies with operations in more 
than 40 countries. Symantec launched its nationwide Connected and Protected Child
Safety Initiative in partnership with Miss America 2007 Lauren Nelson, whose personal
platform is protecting children online. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/

Donn Parker
Cybercrime Authority
Computer criminals are troubled people, according to Donn Parker, so they violate the law in an attempt to solve their 
problems. In an attempt to fight cybercrime, Parker founded the International Information Integrity Institute (I-4), then
interviewed hundreds of computer criminals and analyzed thousands of security crime cases during the past 30 years.
Security systems within corporations are critical, he says, but they should evolve constantly to defend against attack-
ers. He created the International Information Integrity Institute (I-4) for industry leaders to meet regularly to share their
strategies, ideas, experiences, and expertise on managing information-related business risks.
Parker has conducted security reviews for more than 250 companies and has written 6 computer security books.

Clifford Stoll
Computer Philosopher
Computers have become integrated in practically every phase of our lives, but Clifford Stoll wants us to think about their
effect on our quality of life. He questions the benefits technology presumably provides and the role computers play in
schools.
In his books, Silicon Snake Oil — Second Thoughts on the Information Highway and High Tech Heretic: Why Computers
Don’t Belong in the Classroom, Stoll maintains that “life in the real world is far more interesting, far more important, far
richer, than anything you’ll ever find on a computer screen.”
He first gained fame by writing the book, The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy through the Maze of Computer Espionage,
which describes his efforts tracking a hacker who was part of a spy ring selling computer secrets to the Soviet Union’s KGB
for money and drugs. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch10/people and then click Clifford Stoll.

Chapter Review
The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students regarding
any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch10/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
How Can Users Safeguard against Computer Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, Botnets, Denial of Service
Attacks, Back Doors, and Spoofing?
A computer virus is a potentially damaging program that infects a computer and negatively affects the way the computer
works. A worm is a program that copies itself repeatedly, using up resources and possibly shutting down the computer or
network. A Trojan horse is a program that hides within or looks like a legitimate program. Users can take precautions to
guard against this malware, short for malicious software. Do not start a computer with removable media in the drives or
ports unless the media are uninfected. Never open an e-mail attachment unless it is from a trusted source. Disable macros
in documents that are not from a trusted source. Install an antivirus program and a personal firewall program. Stay
informed about any new virus alert or virus hoax. To defend against a botnet, a denial of service attack, improper use 
of a back door, and spoofing, users can install a firewall and install intrusion detection software.
What Are Techniques to Prevent Unauthorized Access and Use?
Unauthorized access is the use of a computer or network without permission. Unauthorized use is the use of a computer
or its data for unapproved or illegal activities. A written acceptable use policy (AUP) outlines the activities for which the
computer and network may and may not be used. Other measures include firewalls and intrusion detection software. 
An access control defines who can access a computer, when they can access it, and what actions they can take. An audit trail
records in a file both successful and unsuccessful access attempts. Access controls include a user name and password, a 
possessed object, and a biometric device. 
What Are Safeguards against Hardware Theft and Vandalism?
Hardware theft is the act of stealing computer equipment. Hardware vandalism is the act of defacing or destroying 
computer equipment. Physical devices and practical security measures, passwords, possessed objects, and biometrics can
reduce the risk of theft or render a computer useless if it is stolen.
How Do Software Manufacturers Protect against Software Theft and Information Theft?
Software theft occurs when someone steals software, intentionally erases programs, or illegally copies programs.
Software piracy is the unauthorized and illegal duplication of copyrighted software. To protect themselves from software
piracy, manufacturers issue a license agreement that provides specific conditions for use of the software. During product
activation, users provide the product’s identification number to receive an installation identification number unique to
their computer. Companies attempt to prevent information theft through user identification and authentication controls,
encryption, a digital signature, a digital certificate, or a certificate authority.
What Types of Devices Are Available to Protect Computers against System Failure?
A system failure is the prolonged malfunction of a computer. A common cause of system failure is an electrical power 
variation. A surge protector uses special electrical components to provide a stable current flow to the computer. An
uninterruptible power supply (UPS) contains surge protection circuits and one or more batteries that can provide power
during a power loss.
What Are Risks and Safeguards Associated with Wireless Communications?
Wireless access poses additional security risks. Intruders connect to other wireless networks to gain free Internet access 
or to access a company’s confidential data. Some individuals intercept and monitor communications as they are transmit-
ted. Others connect to a network through an unsecured wireless access point (WAP). Some safeguards include firewalls,
reconfiguring the WAP, and ensuring equipment uses a wireless security standard, such as Wi-Fi Protected Access and
802.11i.

What Are Issues Surrounding Information Privacy?
Information privacy is the right of individuals and companies to restrict the collection and use of information about them.
Issues surrounding information privacy include electronic profiles, cookies, spyware and adware, phishing, spam, social
engineering, employee monitoring, and computer forensics. An electronic profile combines data about an individual’s Web
use with data from public sources. A cookie is a file that a Web server stores on a computer to collect data about the user.
Spyware is a program placed on a computer that secretly collects information about the user. Adware is a program that dis-
plays an online advertisement in a banner or pop-up window. Phishing is a scam in which a perpetrator sends an official
looking e-mail message that attempts to obtain a user’s personal and financial information. Pharming is a scam where a 
perpetrator attempts to obtain your personal and financial information, except they do so via spoofing. Spam is an unso-
licited e-mail message or newsgroup posting sent to many recipients. As related to the use of computers, social engineering
is defined as gaining unauthorized access or obtaining confidential information by taking advantage of the trusting human
nature of some victims and the naivety of others. Employee monitoring uses computers to observe, record, and review an
employee’s computer use. Computer forensics is the discovery, collection, and analysis of evidence found on computers and
networks.
How Can Health-Related Disorders and Injuries Due to Computer Use Be Prevented?
A repetitive strain injury (RSI) is an injury or disorder of the muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, and joints. Computer-related
RSIs include tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Another health-related condition is eyestrain associated with
computer vision syndrome (CVS). To prevent health-related disorders, take frequent breaks, use precautionary exercises 
and techniques, and incorporate ergonomics when planning the workplace. Computer addiction occurs when the computer
consumes someone’s entire social life. Computer addiction is a treatable illness through therapy and support groups.

LEARN HOW TO 2: Use the Windows Vista Firewall
When you use the Internet, data is sent both
from your computer to the Internet and from
computers on the Internet to your computer. 
Afirewall is a barrier that checks information coming from the
Internet and either turns it away or allows it to pass through
to your computer, based on your firewall settings. It also checks
data being sent from your computer to the Internet to
ensure your computer is not sending unsolicited
messages to other computers on the Internet. Afirewall
can be implemented using hardware or software.
Windows Vista contains a software firewall that starts 
automatically when you boot your computer. To control the 
firewall usage on your computer, complete the following steps:
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar, and then 
click Control Panel on the Start menu.
2. In the Classic View of the Control Panel, double-click 
Security Center, and then click Windows Firewall in the
Windows Security Center window to open the Windows
Firewall window (Figure 10-28).
3. In the Windows Firewall window, click the Turn Windows
Firewall on or off link to turn on or off the Windows firewall. 
The firewall automatically is on when you start your computer. 
You should NOT turn off the firewall unless you have a compelling 
reason to do so.
4. Click the ‘Allow a program through Windows Firewall’ link to display the
Exceptions sheet in the Windows Firewall Settings dialog box (Figure 10-29).
The exceptions that are checked can communicate with the Internet without 
your clicking a link.
5. You may want to allow programs that routinely communicate with 
the Internet, such as sports programs that display updated game 
scores, to have full access to your computer. To add a program to 
the Exceptions list, click the Add program button in the Exceptions 
sheet. The Add a Program dialog box is displayed. Select a program 
and then click the OK button.

assachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Nicholas Negroponte coined the phrase, digital
convergence, in his book, Being Digital. While some technology experts believe this term
focuses on software, others believe it refers to hardware and networking, while still others see
it as a service. The one commonality of all these views is the core of bits and bytes of data, music,
video, graphics, text, and voice. Today, we are closer than ever in being able to share all these modes
of entertainment seamlessly. Personal mobile devices allow us to record and listen to music; view
favorite television programs or movies; keep in touch with the office, family, and friends; present ideas
to others using real data and images; and entertain at home.

The Personal Computer 
and Television
Falling prices for big-screen televisions and monitors
have enticed consumers to update their media rooms
and home offices. Flat panel and projection televisions
have become the focal points of home entertainment
systems. Their dramatic high-resolution pictures 
coupled with surround-sound systems and proper 
furniture provide the ultimate viewing experience.
FIGURE 2
Microsoft’s Windows Media Center in
Windows Vista allows you to experience viewing all
your favorite digital entertainment on your computer,
including live and recorded television programs,
movies, music, and photos. Media Center Extenders,
including the Xbox 360, expand the multimedia
experience throughout your home on up to five
televisions.
FIGURE 1
Multimedia personal computers can
perform the dual roles of being used for work and
play. Equipped with a large-capacity hard disk,
rewritable DVD drives, and a wide-screen and high-
definition monitor, they allow you to download and
burn movies, audio CDs, podcasts, and vodcasts,
and then transfer these files to smart phones and
other personal mobile devices.

Social networking Web sites such as
Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, TagWorld, and Bebo
are popular forms of self-expression and pervasive
ways to stay in touch and share experiences with
friends and family. YouTube visitors watch more than
100 million video clips every day, with some individual
videos viewed more than 5 million times. Some of these
video Web sites pay users as much as $2,000 for
uploading their videos.

Digital Entertainment
Recording Audio and Video
Whether you are in the mood for an action-packed
movie or some soothing new-age music, digital 
entertainment products can fulfill your needs.
Download your favorite songs to a portable media
player and play them in your car or while you work out
at the gym, use your digital video recorder and record
directly to a DVD to take to Grandma’s house, or record
movies and television programs on your digital video
recorder when you are not at home and then play them
at your convenience. Many smart phones, portable
media players such as the iPod and Zune, and other
personal mobile devices, are video capable, so that you
can watch full-length movies or popular television 
programs. Video and music downloads are expected 
to generate more than $2.6 billion in sales this year.
FIGURE 4
DVD burners are considered
essential peripherals and can be mounted
internally in your computer or connected
externally using USB or FireWire cables. Dual-
format, dual-layer drives allow you to purchase
and download files onto the DVDs without
recompression, which preserves the original
image quality. Many people are using DVD
burners to transfer and consequently preserve
their photos and home videos.  
FIGURE 5
Millions of music and movie fans
use dedicated networks to download files
legally. They then store their tunes and movies 
on their portable media players and smart

All the World Is a Game
Computer and video game software is an $18 billion
industry, according to the NPD Group. From one-
player games to serious competition with fellow
gamers, it is easy to find sports, strategy, and action
games to suit everyone’s interests. Gaming hard-
ware can be sorted into three categories: personal
computer, console, and handheld. With a broadband
connection and home network, you can compete
online and tie together multiple personal computer
and game consoles.
FIGURE 16
In a computer role-playing game (CRPG),
players interact with each other and generally attempt 
to accomplish a quest. They navigate through complex
landscapes and often must decide which path to travel by
using maps and logic. Their decisions affect subsequent
paths, and a game can have multiple endings based on
the actions taken. Some gaming enthusiasts modify the
original games by adding venues and stories.
FIGURE 15
Nintendo’s Wii gives gamers new
experiences with motion control. The Wii includes
different types of input devices; the Wii Remote and the

measures acceleration forces electromechanically. The
accelerometers sense motion and transmit a signal 
using Bluetooth technology to a sensor bar, which can
be up to 30 feet away. Up to four Wii Remotes can be
connected simultaneously for multiplayer interaction.

THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
A
system is a set of components that interact to achieve a common goal. Businesses use
many types of systems. A billing system allows a company to send invoices and receive
payments from customers. Through a payroll system, employees receive paychecks. A
manufacturing system produces the goods that customers order. An inventory system keeps track
of the items in a warehouse. Very often, these systems also are information systems.
An information system (IS) is a collection of hardware, software, data, people, and procedures
that work together to produce quality information. An information system supports daily, short-
term, and long-range activities of users. Some examples of users include store clerks, sales repre-
sentatives, accountants, supervisors, managers, executives, and customers. 
The type of information that users need often changes. When this occurs, the information system
must meet the new requirements. In some cases, members of the system development team modify
the current information system. In other cases, they develop an entirely new information system.
As a computer user in a business, you someday may participate in the modification of an
existing system or the development of a new system. Thus, it is important that you understand
the system development process. The system development cycle is a set of activities used to
build an information system. 
System development cycles often organize activities by grouping them into larger categories
called phases. Most system development cycles contain five phases:
1. Planning
4. Implementation
2. Analysis
5. Operation, Support, and Security
3. Design
As shown in Figure 11-1, each phase in the system development cycle consists of a series of
activities, and the phases form a loop. In theory, the five phases in the system development cycle
often appear sequentially, as shown in Figure 11-1. In reality, activities within adjacent phases often
interact with one another — making the system development cycle a dynamic iterative process.

FIGURE 11-1
The system development cycle consists of five phases that form a loop. Several ongoing activities also
take place throughout the entire system development cycle.
C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:29 PM  Page 406

System development should follow three general guidelines: arrange activities into phases,
involve the users, and develop standards.
1. The system development cycle should group activities into phases. Many system development
cycles contain the five major phases shown in Figure 11-1. Others have more or fewer phases.
Regardless, all system development cycles have similar activities and tasks. 
2. Users must be involved throughout the entire system development cycle. Users include
anyone for whom the system is being built. Customers, employees, students, data entry clerks,
accountants, sales managers, and owners all are examples of users. Users are more apt to
accept a new system if they contribute to its design.
3. The system development cycle should have standards clearly defined. Standards are sets of
rules and procedures a company expects employees to accept and follow. Having standards
helps people working on the same project produce consistent results. 
Who Participates in the System Development Cycle?
System development should involve representatives from each department in which the 
proposed system will be used. This includes both nontechnical users and IT professionals. During
the system development cycle, the systems analyst meets and works with a variety of people 
(Figure 11-2). A systems analyst is responsible for designing and developing an information system.
The systems analyst is the users’ primary contact person.

CHAPTER 11
INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
Small companies may have one systems analyst or even one person who assumes the roles of
both systems analyst and programmer. Larger companies often have multiple systems analysts.
Some companies refer to a systems analyst as a system developer. Read Looking Ahead 11-1 for 
a look at the future skills for systems analysts.
Systems analysts are the liaison between the users and the IT professionals. They convert user
requests into technical specifications. They must be familiar with business operations, be able to
solve problems, have the ability to introduce and support change, and possess excellent commu-
nications and interpersonal skills. Systems analysts prepare many reports, drawings, and dia-
grams. They discuss various aspects of the development project with users, management, other
analysts, database analysts, database administrators, network administrators, the Webmaster, pro-
grammers, vendors, and the steering committee. The steering committee is a decision-making
body in a company.
For each system development project, a company usually forms a project team to work on the
project from beginning to end. The project team consists of users, the systems analyst, and other IT
professionals. One member of the team is the project leader, who manages and controls the budget
and schedule of the project. The systems analyst may or may not be selected as the project leader of
the project.
Project Management
Project management is the process of planning, scheduling, and then controlling the activities
during the system development cycle. The goal of project management is to deliver an acceptable
system to the user in an agreed-upon time frame, while maintaining costs.
To plan and schedule a project effectively, the project leader identifies the following elements
for the project:
• Goal, objectives, and expectations of the project, collectively called the scope
• Required activities
• Time estimates for each activity
• Cost estimates for each activity
• Order of activities
• Activities that can take place at the same time
Right-Brain Skills Essential for Analysts’ Success
Systems analysts use the left side of their brains to think in a logical, 
analytical manner when designing and developing information systems.
What will matter most for these people, however, is how they use the
right side of their brain, according to researchers such as Daniel Pink.
Right-brain abilities affect creativity, self-expression, and artistry, and
these skills will be essential for survival in our technological world.
According to Pink, automation has replaced the hard labor that helped
build much of America in the twentieth century, and today computers are
replacing many routine tasks, such as balancing checkbooks and prepar-
ing wills. The right-brain abilities systems analysts and other developers
will need for success include empathy, meaning, and play. These aptitudes
will create professional success and personal fulfillment.
Pink says everyone has these right-brain attributes, but they must
develop their minds to master their imaginative and emotional abilities
through exercises and critical thinking. For more information, visit

When these items are identified, the project leader usually records them in a project plan. A
popular tool used to plan and schedule the time relationships among project activities is a Gantt
chart (Figure 11-3). A Gantt chart, developed by Henry L. Gantt, is a bar chart that uses horizon-
tal bars to show project phases or activities. The left side, or vertical axis, displays the list of
required activities. A horizontal axis across the top or bottom of the chart represents time. A tool
used for planning and scheduling large, complex projects is the PERT chart. A PERT chart, short
for Program Evaluations and Review Technique chart, analyzes the time required to complete a
task and identifies the minimum time required for an entire project.
When the project features and deadlines have been determined, the project leader monitors
and controls the project. Some activities take less time than originally planned. Others take
longer. Project leaders should have good change management skills so that they can recognize
when a change in the project has occurred and take actions to react to the change. It is crucial
that everyone is aware of and agrees on any changes made to the project plan.
Feasibility Assessment
Feasibility is a measure of how suitable the development of a system will be to the company. 
A project that is feasible at one point of the system development cycle might become infeasible 
at a later point. Thus, systems analysts frequently reevaluate feasibility during the system 
development cycle.
Four tests to evaluate feasibility are:
• Operational feasibility: Measures how well the proposed information system will work. Will
the users like the new system? Will they use it? Will it meet their requirements? 
• Schedule feasibility: Measures whether the established deadlines for the project are reasonable. 
If a deadline is not reasonable, the project leader might make a new schedule. If a deadline 
cannot be extended, then the scope of the project might be reduced to meet a mandatory 
deadline.
• Technical feasibility: Measures whether the company has or can obtain the hardware, software,
and people needed to deliver and then support the proposed information system. 
• Economic feasibility, also called cost/benefit feasibility: Measures whether the lifetime 
benefits of the proposed information system will be greater than its lifetime costs.  
Documentation
During the entire system development cycle, project members produce much documentation.
Documentation is the collection and summarization of data and information. It includes reports,
diagrams, programs, or any other information generated during the system development cycle.
It is important that all documentation be well written, thorough, consistent, and understandable.
The final information system should be reflected accurately and completely in documentation
developed throughout the development cycle. Maintaining up-to-date documentation should be
an ongoing part of system development.

Data and Information Gathering Techniques
Systems analysts and other IT professionals use several techniques to gather data and 
information. They review documentation, observe, survey, interview, conduct joint-application
design sessions, and do research. 
• Review Documentation — By reviewing documentation such as a company’s organization chart,
memos, and meeting minutes, systems analysts learn about the history of a project. Documentation
also provides information about the company such as its operations, weaknesses, and strengths.
• Observe — Observing people helps systems analysts understand exactly how they perform a
task. Likewise, observing a machine allows you to see how it works. Read Ethics & Issues 11-1
for a related discussion.
• Survey — To obtain data and information from a large number of people, systems analysts 
distribute surveys.
• Interview — The interview is the most important 
data and information gathering technique for the sys-
tems analyst. It allows the systems analyst to clarify
responses and probe for face-to-face feedback. 
• JAD Sessions — Instead of a single one-on-one
interview, analysts often use  joint-application 
design sessions to gather data and information. 
Joint-application design (JAD) sessions are a series 
of lengthy, structured, group meetings in which users 
and IT professionals work together to design or
develop an application (Figure 11-4).
• Research — Newspapers, computer magazines,
reference books, trade shows, the Web, vendors, and
consultants are excellent sources of information. These
sources can provide the systems analyst with informa-
tion such as the latest hardware and software products
and explanations of new processes and procedures.

CHAPTER 11
INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
Do You Work Harder When Someone Is Watching?
During the data and information gathering stage of the system development cycle, employees are involved actively in the process. 
They complete surveys, participate in interviews, and are observed while performing their jobs. Many researchers suggest that during
observation, employees may not exhibit everyday behavior and may perform above and beyond their normal workday activities. They 
base this premise on the Hawthorne Effect, which is the result of a study performed in the 1920s in the Western Electric Company plant 
in Hawthorne, Illinois. The study discovered that productivity improved during observation, whether the conditions were made better or
worse. Researchers concluded that productivity seemed to improve whenever the workers knew they were being observed. What is your
opinion of the Hawthorne Effect? Do you agree with the research? If someone is observing you at work or if you are receiving increased
attention, does this cause you to alter your behavior? Why or why not? Is such observation ethical, and can it have other psychological
effects on employees? If productivity increases during observation, is observation a good data gathering technique in a system study? 
Why or why not?
FIGURE 11-4
During a JAD session, the systems analyst is the
moderator, or leader, of the discussion. Another member, called the
scribe, records facts and action items assigned during the session.
ETHICS & ISSUES 11-1
What Initiates the System Development Cycle?
A user may request a new or modified information system for a variety of reasons. The most
obvious reason is to correct a problem. Another reason is to improve the information system.
Organizations may want to improve hardware, software, or other technology to enhance an infor-
mation system. If an unauthorized user gains access to the information system, then changes
must be made to the security of the system.
Sometimes situations outside the control of a company require a modification to an informa-
tion system. Corporate management or some other governing body may mandate a change.
Competition also can lead to change. In recent years, another source of change has resulted from
one company merging with or acquiring another company.

THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
How Can Workers Overcome Writer’s Block When Preparing Documentation?
Proper documentation is one of the most important tasks for workers during the development cycle. Many people, however, find that writing
documentation is a tedious and anxiety-inducing endeavor. The term, writer’s block, describes a range of reasons why some people cannot
start or finish the writing process. Too often, writer’s block simply leads to a lack of documentation or a poorly documented project. Experts,
including psychologists and authors, have determined a number of reasons why writer’s block occurs, including fear, self-consciousness, and
lack of structure. They also have determined a number of strategies for dealing with writer’s block, including adding structure to the process,
rewarding oneself after writing a certain number of sentences or paragraphs, and talking through ideas with inanimate objects.
Other experts claim the notion of writer’s block does not really exist, but rather is a simple, socially accepted excuse for not completing 
a job. Some blame the educational system, including colleges, for turning out generations of professionals who have not been taught to
write. What strategies should employers encourage to overcome writer’s block related to documenting a project? Is writer’s block a conven-
ient excuse for not completing a job? Why or why not? Should the educational system demand more from students with respect to their
ability to write? Why or why not?
FIGURE 11-5b

FIGURE 11-5a
(informal project request)
FIGURE 11-5
Sometimes users informally communicate a project request verbally or as an e-mail message. In larger companies,
requests often are documented on a form such as this Request for System Services.
A user may request a new or modified information system verbally in a telephone conversation
or written as an e-mail message (Figure 11-5a). In larger companies, users write a formal request
for a new or modified information system, which is called a request for system services or project
request (Figure 11-5b). The project request becomes the first item of documentation for the project
(read Ethics & Issues 11-2 for a related discussion). It also triggers the first phase of the system
development cycle: planning.

inches. Each café has a minimum of 30 computers, along with two color laser printers, a
digital camera, and a scanner. All computers have popular software such as Microsoft Office
2007 and Adobe Photoshop. The café also is a hot spot, which means customers can use
their own mobile computer or mobile device to connect wirelessly to the Internet. For each
beverage purchased, customers receive 30 minutes of free computer use and/or Web access.
For additional time, the fee is $3.00 per hour.
Since Cyber Coast Café started operations in 1997, business has been thriving. The cafés
serve thousands of customers around the world. Allison Popovich, chief information officer
(CIO) for Cyber Coast Café, offers one suggestion for the company’s financial success. “We
do not pay for the computers and equipment in our cafés. Instead, we allow computer ven-
dors to use our café as a storefront for their products. This provides customers with the
opportunity to try out the hardware and software before making a purchase. When cus-
tomers are ready to purchase computers, we direct them to the vendor’s online storefront
for discount pricing.”
To showcase their hardware and software in the cafés, computer vendors request infor-
mation from Chad Goldstein, the marketing manager. The number of these requests is ris-
ing quickly. The cost of copying and mailing this material is becoming excessive. For this
reason, Chad would like this vendor information made available on the Web. Vendors could
download information sheets, press releases, photos, and other information from the Web
site. Placing this information on the Web would save Chad and his staff a great deal of time
and money.
Chad realizes this task will require substantial company resources. He believes a systems
study is necessary. He sends an e-mail message to the vice president of information systems
(Figure 11-5a on the previous page). She agrees and tells him to fill out a Request for System
Services form (Figure 11-5b on the previous page) and submit it to Juanita Mendez, chair of
the steering committee at Cyber Coast Café.

How can systems analysts build relationships with users?
Systems analysts have much more credibility with users if the analysts understand user concerns and have
empathy for how the workers are feeling. If users are involved, they are more likely to accept and use the new
system — called user buy-in. One reason systems fail is because some systems analysts create or modify
systems with little or no user participation. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch11/faq and then

Planning Phase
The planning phase for a project begins when the steering committee receives a project request.
This committee usually consists of five to nine people. It typically includes a mix of vice presi-
dents, managers, nonmanagement users, and IT personnel.
During the planning phase, four major activities are performed: (1) review and approve the
project requests; (2) prioritize the project requests; (3) allocate resources such as money, people,
and equipment to approved projects; and (4) form a project development team for each approved
project. 
The projects that receive the highest priority are those mandated by management or some other
governing body. These requests are given immediate attention. The steering committee evaluates
the remaining project requests based on their value to the company. The steering committee
approves some projects and rejects others. Of the approved projects, it is likely that only a few
will begin their system development cycle immediately. Others will have to wait for additional
funds or resources to become available.
413
THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
Planning at Cyber Coast Café
After receiving the project request (Figure 11-5b on page 411) from Chad, Juanita Mendez
distributes it to all members of the steering committee. They will discuss the request at their
next meeting. The steering committee members of Cyber Coast Café are Juanita Mendez,
controller and chair of the steering committee; Milan Sciranka, vice president of operations;
Suzy Zhao, Webmaster; Donnell Carter, training specialist; Karl Schmidt, systems analyst;
and Bethany Ames, vice president of information systems. Juanita also invites Chad
Goldstein to the next steering committee meeting. Because he originated the project request,
Chad will have the knowledge to answer questions.
During the meeting, the committee decides the project request identifies an improvement
to the system, instead of a problem. They feel the nature of the improvement (to make ven-
dor information available on the Web) could lead to considerable savings for the company.
It also will provide quicker service to potential vendors.
The steering committee approves the request. Juanita points out that the company has 
enough funds in its budget to begin the project immediately. Thus, Bethany assembles a 
system development project team. She assigns Karl Schmidt, systems analyst, as the project
leader. Karl and his team immediately begin the next phase: analysis.
Analysis Phase
The analysis phase consists of two major activities: (1) conduct a preliminary investigation 
and (2) perform detailed analysis. The following sections discuss these activities.
THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION
The main purpose of the preliminary investigation, sometimes
called the feasibility study, is to determine the exact nature of the problem or improvement and
decide whether it is worth pursuing. Should the company continue to assign resources to this
project? To answer this question, the systems analyst conducts a general study of the project. 
The first activity in the preliminary investigation is to interview the user who submitted the
project request. Depending on the nature of the request, project team members may interview
other users, too. 
In addition to interviewing, members of the project team may use other data gathering 
techniques, such as reviewing existing documentation. Often, the preliminary investigation is
completed in just a few days.
C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:30 PM  Page 413

Upon completion of the preliminary investigation, the systems analyst writes the feasibility
report. This report presents the team’s findings to the steering committee. The feasibility report
contains these major sections: introduction, existing system, benefits of a new or modified system,
feasibility of a new or modified system, and the recommendation (Figure 11-6).
In some cases, the project team may recommend not to continue the project. If the steering com-
mittee agrees, the project ends at this point. If the project team recommends continuing and the
steering committee approves this recommendation, then detailed analysis begins.

Preliminary Investigation at Cyber Coast Café 
Karl Schmidt, systems analyst and project leader, meets with Chad Goldstein to discuss the project request. During
the interview, Karl looks at the material that Chad’s staff sends to a potential vendor. He asks Chad how many vendor
requests he receives in a month. Then Karl interviews the controller, Juanita Mendez, to obtain some general cost and
benefit figures for the feasibility report. He also calls a vendor. He wants to know if the material Chad’s department
sends is helpful.
Next, Karl prepares the feasibility report (Figure 11-6). After the project team members review it, Karl submits it 
to the steering committee. The report recommends proceeding to the detailed analysis phase for this project. The
steering committee agrees. Karl and his team begin detailed analysis.
C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:30 PM  Page 414

DETAILED ANALYSIS
Detailed analysis involves three major activities: (1) study how the current
system works; (2) determine the users’ wants, needs, and requirements; and (3) recommend a
solution. Detailed analysis sometimes is called logical design because the systems analysts
develop the proposed solution without regard to any specific hardware or software. That is, 
they make no attempt to identify the procedures that should be automated and those that 
should be manual.
During these activities, systems analysts use all of the data and information-gathering 
techniques. They review documentation, observe employees and machines, distribute surveys,
interview employees, conduct JAD sessions, and do research. 
While studying the current system and identifying user requirements, the systems analyst col-
lects a great deal of data and information. A major task for the systems analyst is to document
these findings in a way that can be understood by everyone. Systems analysts use diagrams to
describe the processes that transform inputs into outputs and diagrams that graphically show 
the flow of data in the system. Both users and IT professionals refer to this documentation.
THE SYSTEM PROPOSAL
After the systems analyst has studied the current system and determined
all user requirements, the next step is to communicate possible solutions for the project in a sys-
tem proposal. The purpose of the system proposal is to assess the feasibility of each alternative
solution and then recommend the most feasible solution for the project, which often involves
modifying or building on the current system. The systems analyst presents the system proposal to
the steering committee. If the steering committee approves a solution, the project enters the
design phase.
When the steering committee discusses the system proposal and decides which alternative to
pursue, it often is deciding whether to buy packaged software from an outside source, build its
own custom software, or outsource some or all of its IT needs to an outside firm.
• Packaged software is mass-produced, copyrighted, prewritten software available for purchase.
Packaged software is available for different types of computers. Chapter 3 presented many
types of application software available for personal computers. These include word processing,
spreadsheet, database, document management, note taking, desktop publishing, paint/image
editing, Web page authoring, personal finance, legal, tax preparation, educational/reference, 
e-mail, and Web browser software. 
Vendors offer two types of packaged software: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal market
software meets the needs of many different types of companies. The programs discussed in
Chapter 3 were horizontal. If a company has a unique way of accomplishing activities, then it
also may require vertical market software. Vertical market software specifically is designed for
a particular business or industry. Examples of companies that use vertical market software
include banks, schools, hospitals, real estate offices, libraries, and insurance companies. Each 
of these industries has unique information processing requirements.
• Instead of buying packaged software, some companies write their own applications using
programming languages such as Java, C++, C#, and Visual Basic. Application software developed
by the user or at the user’s request is called custom software. 
The main advantage of custom software is that it matches the company’s requirements
exactly. The disadvantages usually are that it is more expensive and takes longer to design 
and implement than packaged software. 
• Companies can develop custom software in-house using their own IT personnel or outsource
it, which means having an outside source develop it for them. Some companies outsource just
the software development aspect of their IT operation. Others outsource more or all of their IT
operation. Depending on a company’s needs, outside firms can handle as much or as little of
the IT requirements as desired. A trend that has caused much controversy relates to companies
that outsource to firms located outside their homeland.

CHAPTER 11
INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
Detailed Analysis at Cyber Coast Café
Karl and his team begin performing the activities in the detailed analysis phase of the 
Vendor Web System. As part of the study and requirements activities, they use several of
the data and information gathering techniques available to them. They interview employees
throughout the company and meet with some vendors. They observe the marketing staff
copy and mail vendor information. They prepare documents that become part of the project
documentation. Members of the project team refer to these documents during the remainder
of the system development cycle.
After two months of studying the existing system and obtaining user requirements, Karl
discusses his findings with his supervisor, Bethany Ames. Karl recommends that a link to
Vendor Information be added to their current Web site. When a vendor clicks this link, a
Vendor Information page will be displayed. This Web page should contain all information
that the marketing department usually sends to a vendor.
Based on Karl’s findings, Bethany writes a system proposal for the steering committee 
to review. Suzy Zhao, Webmaster at Cyber Coast Café, developed the current Web site. Thus,
Bethany recommends that Suzy’s staff modify the Web site in-house. Bethany also recom-
mends that Cyber Coast Café invest in a larger database server to handle the additional
vendor information.
The steering committee agrees with Bethany’s proposal. Karl and his team begin the
design phase of the project.
Design Phase
The design phase consists of two major activities: (1) if necessary, acquire hardware and 
software and (2) develop all of the details of the new or modified information system. The 
systems analyst often performs these two activities at the same time instead of sequentially.
ACQUIRING NECESSARY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
When the steering committee approves a
solution, the systems analyst begins the activity of obtaining additional hardware or software.
The systems analyst may skip this activity if the approved solution does not require new hard-
ware or software. If this activity is required, it consists of four major tasks: (1) identify technical
specifications, (2) solicit vendor proposals, (3) test and evaluate vendor proposals, and (4) make 
a decision.
Identifying Technical Specifications
The first step in acquiring necessary hardware and 
software is to identify all the hardware and software requirements of the new or modified sys-
tem. To do this, systems analysts use a variety of research techniques. They talk with other sys-
tems analysts, visit vendors’ stores, and search the Web. Many trade journals, newspapers, and
magazines provide some or all of their printed content as e-zines. An e-zine (pronounced 
ee-zeen), or electronic magazine, is a publication available on the Web.
After the systems analyst defines the technical requirements, the next step is to summarize
these requirements for potential vendors. The systems analyst can use three basic types of docu-
ments for this purpose: an RFQ, an RFP, or an RFI. A request for quotation (RFQ) identifies the
required product(s). With an RFQ, the vendor quotes a price for the listed product(s). With a
request for proposal (RFP), the vendor selects the product(s) that meets specified requirements
and then quotes the price(s). A request for information (RFI) is a less formal method that uses a
standard form to request information about a product or service.
C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:30 PM  Page 416

Soliciting Vendor Proposals
Systems analysts send the RFQ, RFP, or RFI to potential 
hardware and software vendors. Another source for hardware and software products is a 
value-added reseller. A value-added reseller (VAR) is a company that purchases products 
from manufacturers and then resells these products to the public — offering additional 
services with the product (Figure 11-7). 
Instead of using vendors, some companies hire an IT consultant or a group of IT consultants. 
An IT consultant is a professional who is hired based on computer expertise, including service 
and advice. IT consultants often specialize in configuring hardware and software for businesses 
of all sizes. 
417
THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
FIGURE 11-7
Many VARs provide complete systems, often called turnkey solutions.
Testing and Evaluating Vendor Proposals
After sending RFQs and RFPs to potential vendors,
the systems analyst will receive completed quotations and proposals. Evaluating the proposals
and then selecting the best one often is a difficult task. It is important to be as objective as possible
while evaluating each proposal.
Systems analysts use many techniques to test the various software products from vendors.
They obtain a list of user references from the software vendors. They also talk to current users of
the software to solicit their opinions. Some vendors will give a demonstration of the product(s)
specified. Other vendors provide demonstration copies or trial versions, allowing the companies
to test the software themselves. 
Sometimes it is important to know whether the software can process a certain volume of trans-
actions efficiently. In this case, the systems analyst conducts a benchmark test. A benchmark test
measures the performance of hardware or software. For example, a benchmark test could meas-
ure the time it takes a payroll program to print 50 paychecks. Comparing the time it takes various
accounting programs to print the same 50 paychecks is one way of measuring each program’s
performance.

C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:30 PM  Page 417

Making a Decision
Having rated the proposals, the systems analyst presents a recommendation
to the steering committee. The recommendation could be to award a contract to a vendor or to not
make any purchases at this time.
418
CHAPTER 11
INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
Hardware Acquisition at Cyber Coast Café
Karl and his team compile a requirements list for the database server. They prepare an
RFP and submit it to twelve vendors: eight through the Web and four local computer stores.
Ten vendors reply within the three-week deadline.
Of the ten replies, the development team selects two to evaluate. They eliminate the other
eight because these vendors did not offer adequate warranties for the database server. The
project team members ask for benchmark test results for each server. In addition, they con-
tact two current users of this database server for their opinions about its performance. After
evaluating these two servers, the team selects the best one.
Karl summarizes his team’s findings in a report to the steering committee. The committee
gives Karl authorization to award a contract to the proposed vendor. As a courtesy and to
maintain good working relationships, Karl sends a letter to all twelve vendors informing
them of the commitee’s decision.
DETAILED DESIGN
The next step is to develop detailed design specifications for the components
in the proposed solution. The activities to be performed include developing designs for the data-
bases, inputs, outputs, and programs.
• During database design, the systems analyst works closely with the database analysts and 
database administrators to identify those data elements that currently exist within the company
and those that are new.
The systems analyst also addresses user access
privileges. This means that the systems analyst
defines which data elements each user can access,
when they can access the data elements, what
actions they can perform on the data elements,
and under what circumstances they can access the
elements. 
• During detailed design of inputs and outputs, the
systems analyst carefully designs every menu,
screen, and report specified in the requirements.
The outputs often are designed first because they
help define the requirements for the inputs. Thus,
it is very important that outputs are identified 
correctly and that users agree to them. 
The systems analyst typically develops two
types of designs for each input and output: a
mockup and a layout chart. A mockup is a sample
of the input or output that contains actual data
(Figure 11-8). The systems analyst shows mockups
to users for their approval. Because users will
work with the inputs and outputs of the system, it
is crucial to involve users during input and output
design. 
FIGURE 11-8
Users must give their approval on all
inputs and outputs. This input screen is a mockup
(containing actual sample data) for users to review.
C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:30 PM  Page 418

After users approve the mockup, the systems analyst develops 
a layout chart for the programmer. A layout chart is more tech-
nical and contains programming-like notations. Many database
programs provide tools for technical design (Figure 11-9).
Other issues that must be addressed during input and output
design include the types of media to use (paper, video, audio);
formats (graphical or narrative); and data entry validation
techniques, which include making sure the inputted data is
correct (for example, a state code has to be one of the fifty valid
two-letter state abbreviations).
• During program design, the systems analyst prepares the
program specification package, which identifies required pro-
grams and the relationship among each program, as well as the
input, output, and database specifications.
PROTOTYPING
Many systems analysts today use prototypes during
detailed design. A prototype is a working model of the proposed 
system. The systems analyst actually builds a functional form of the
solution during design. The main advantage of a prototype is users
can work with the system before it is completed — to make sure it
meets their needs. As soon as users approve a prototype, system
analysts can implement a solution more quickly than without a 
prototype. 
CASE TOOLS
Many systems analysts use computer software 
to assist in system development. Computer-aided software 
engineering (CASE) software tools are designed to support one 
or more activities of the system development cycle (Figure 11-10).

QUALITY REVIEW TECHNIQUES
Many people should review the detailed design specifications
before they are given to the programming team. Reviewers should include users, systems analysts,
managers, IT staff, and members of the system development team. If the steering committee decides
the project still is feasible, which usually is the case, the project enters the implementation phase.
C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:30 PM  Page 419

Implementation Phase
The purpose of the implementation phase is to construct, or build, the new or modified system
and then deliver it to the users. Members of the system development team perform four major
activities in this phase: (1) develop programs, (2) install and test the new system, (3) train users,
and (4) convert to the new system. 
DEVELOP PROGRAMS
If the company purchases packaged software and no modifications to the
software are required, the development team may skip this activity. For custom software or pack-
aged software that requires modification, however, programs are developed or modified either by
an outside firm or in-house. Programmers write or modify programs from the program specifica-
tion package created during the analysis phase. Just as the system development cycle follows an
organized set of activities, so does program development. These program development activities
are known as the program development cycle.
The last sections of this chapter identify various programming languages and explain the pro-
gram development cycle. The important concept to understand now is that program development
is part of the implementation phase.
INSTALL AND TEST THE NEW SYSTEM
If the company acquires new hardware or software, someone
must install and test it. The systems analysts should test individual programs. They also should be
sure that all the programs work together in the system. 
Systems analysts and users develop test data so that they can perform various tests. A unit test
verifies that each individual program or object works by itself. A systems test verifies that all pro-
grams in an application work together properly. An integration test verifies that an application
works with other applications. An acceptance test is performed by end-users and checks the new
system to ensure that it works with actual data.
TRAIN USERS
Training involves showing users exactly how they will use the new hardware 
and software in the system. Some training takes place as one-on-one sessions or classroom-style
lectures (Figure 11-11). Other companies use Web-based training, which is a self-directed, self-
paced online instruction method. Whichever technique is used, it should include hands-on ses-
sions with realistic sample data. Users should practice on the actual system during training. Users
also should receive user manuals for reference. It is the systems analyst’s responsibility to create
user manuals, both printed and electronic. Read Looking Ahead 11-2 for a look at the next
generation of training.

Detailed Design at Cyber Coast Café
As approved by the steering committee, Karl and his team begin designing the Vendor
Web System. After studying current vendor information and interviewing more users and
vendors, the team designs changes to the company’s database, Web site, and the associated
programs. They prepare several documents including a mockup (Figure 11-8 on page 418)
and a technical view in Access 2007 (Figure 11-9 on the previous page).
After completing the detailed design, Karl meets with several users and IT personnel to
walk through the design. They locate two errors. He corrects the errors and then presents
the design to the steering committee. The committee agrees with the design solution and
consents to implement it.
How much time is spent fixing errors in programs?
One study estimates that more than 34 percent of a programmer’s time is devoted to fixing program bugs. For

C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:30 PM  Page 420

CONVERT TO THE NEW SYSTEM
The final implementation activity is to
change from the old system to the new system. This change can take
place using one or more of the following conversion strategies: direct,
parallel, phased, or pilot.
With direct conversion, the user stops using the old system and begins
using the new system on a certain date. The advantage of this strategy is
that it requires no transition costs and is a quick implementation tech-
nique. The disadvantage is that it is extremely risky and can disrupt oper-
ations seriously if the new system does not work correctly the first time.
Parallel conversion consists of running the old system alongside the
new system for a specified time. Results from both systems are compared. The advantage of this
strategy is that you can fix any problems in the new system before you terminate the old system.
The disadvantage is that it is costly to operate two systems at the same time.
Larger systems with multiple sites may use a phased conversion. In a phased conversion, 
each location converts at a separate time. For example, an accounting system might convert its
accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, and payroll sites in separate phases. Each
site can use a direct or parallel conversion.
With a pilot conversion, only one location in the company uses the new system — so that it can 
be tested. After the pilot site approves the new system, other sites convert using one of the other
conversion strategies.

THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
Training Delivery Becomes
Flexible
More than 100 million employees will attend a
training session this year. Many of these workers will
be technology users learning to use new software 
and hardware. Information
technology trainers face the
challenge of simplifying com-
plex, technical material in a
diverse worldwide corporate
culture.
Employees will be
experiencing more individu-
alized, self-paced classes
in the office or at home. These Internet-, intranet-
or video-based training packages allow students to
learn at their own pace when they need to master new
skills. The programs give immediate feedback and
stop when an employee has mastered the particular
skill being taught.
Corporations will be offering just-in-time training,
giving employees the opportunity to apply their new
skills soon after the class has ended. An effective
training session pays for itself within weeks and
increases employee performance by nearly 20 
percent, according to a PC Computing survey. For

Implementation at Cyber Coast Café
Upon receiving the program specification package, Karl forms an implementation team of
Suzy Zhao, Webmaster; Adam Rosen, programmer; and Stephan Davis, data modeler. The
team works together to implement the Vendor Web System.
Karl works closely with the team to answer questions about the design and to check the
progress of their work. When the team completes its work, they ask Karl to test it. He does
and it works great!
Karl arranges a training class for the employees of the marketing and customer service
departments. During the training session, he shows them how to use the new Vendor
Information page on the company’s Web site. Karl gives each attendee a printed user guide
and indicates that he will e-mail them the electronic file. He wants to prepare everyone thor-
oughly for the new Web pages once they are posted. Karl also sends a letter to all existing
vendors informing them when this new service will be available and how to use it.

C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:30 PM  Page 421

Operation, Support, and Security Phase
The purpose of the operation, support, and security phase is to provide ongoing assistance for
an information system and its users after the system is implemented. The support phase consists
of three major activities: (1) perform maintenance activities, (2) monitor system performance, and
(3) assess system security.
Information system maintenance activities include fixing errors in, as well as improving on, a
system’s operations. To determine initial maintenance needs, the systems analyst should meet
with users. The purpose of this meeting, called the post-implementation system review, is to dis-
cover whether the information system is performing according to the users’ expectations. In some
cases, users would like the system to do more. Maybe they have enhancements or additional
requirements that involve modifying or expanding an existing information system.
During this phase, the systems analyst monitors performance of the new or modified informa-
tion system. The purpose of performance monitoring is to determine whether the system is ineffi-
cient at any point. If so, is the inefficiency causing a problem? Is the time it takes to download
vendor information reasonable? If not, the systems analyst must investigate solutions to make the
information system more efficient and reliable — back to the planning phase.
Most organizations must deal with complex computer security issues. All elements of an infor-
mation system — hardware, software, data, people, and procedures — must be secure from threats
both inside and outside the enterprise.
Companies today often have a chief security officer (CSO) who is responsible for the physical
security of a company’s property and people and also is in charge of securing its computing
resources. It is critical that the CSO is included in all system development projects to ensure that
all projects adequately address information security. The CSO uses many of the techniques dis-
cussed in Chapter 10 to maintain confidentiality or limited access to information, ensure integrity
and reliability of systems, ensure uninterrupted availability of systems, ensure compliance with
laws, and cooperate with law enforcement agencies. 
An important responsibility of the CSO is to develop a computer security plan. A computer
security plan summarizes in writing all of the safeguards that are in place to protect a company’s
information assets. The CSO should evaluate the computer security plan annually or more fre-
quently for major changes in information assets, such as the addition of a new computer or the
implementation of a new application. In developing the plan, the CSO should recognize that
some degree of risk is unavoidable; further, the more secure a system is, the more difficult it is for
everyone to use. The goal of a computer security plan is to match an appropriate level of safe-
guards against the identified risks. Fortunately, most organizations never will experience a major
information system disaster.

Operation, Support, and Security at Cyber Coast Café
During the post-implementation system review, Karl learns that the new Web page is
receiving many hits. Vendors are using it and they like it. Customer service regularly receives
e-mail messages from vendors that appreciate the new service. Chad says his staff is working
efficiently on their primary tasks without the interruption and additional workload of mak-
ing copies and sending out vendor data, now that the system has been automated. Data in
the system has been accessed only by authorized users, leading him to conclude security
measures work as planned.
Six months after the Vendor Web System has been in operation, Chad would like to add
more information to the Vendor Information page. He sends an e-mail message to Karl
requesting the change. Karl asks him to fill out a Request for System Services and puts him 
on the agenda of the next steering committee meeting. Back to the planning phase again!

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
The previous sections discussed the phases in the system development cycle. One activity during the
implementation phase is to develop programs. Although you may never write a computer program,
information you request may require a programmer to create or modify a program. Thus, you should
understand how programmers develop programs to meet information requirements. A computer
program is a series of instructions that directs a computer to perform tasks. A computer programmer,
sometimes called a developer, creates and modifies computer programs. 
To create a program, programmers sometimes write, or code, a program’s instructions using a
programming language. A programming language is a set of words, abbreviations, and symbols 
that enables a programmer to communicate instructions to a computer. Other times, programmers
use a program development tool to create a program. A program that provides a user-friendly envi-
ronment for building programs often is called a program development tool. Programmers use a
variety of programming languages and tools to create programs (Figure 11-12).
Several hundred programming languages exist today. Each language has its own rules for 
writing the instructions. Languages often are designed for specific purposes, such 
as scientific applications, business solutions, or Web page development.

Two types of languages are low-level and high-level. A low-level language is a programming
language that is machine dependent. A machine-dependent language runs on only one particular type
of computer. Each instruction in a low-level language usually equates to a single machine instruction,
discussed further in the next section. With a high-level language, by contrast, each instruction typically
equates to multiple machine instructions. High-level languages often are machine independent. A
machine-independent language can run on many different types of computers and operating systems.
The following pages discuss low-level languages, as well as several types of high-level languages.
Low-Level Languages
Two types of low-level languages are machine languages and assembly languages. Machine
language, known as the first generation of programming languages, is the only language the com-
puter directly recognizes (Figure 11-13). Machine language instructions use a series of binary digits
(1s and 0s) or a combination of numbers and letters that represents binary digits. The binary digits
correspond to the on and off electrical states. As you might imagine, coding in machine language is
tedious and time-consuming.
With an assembly language, the second generation of programming languages, a programmer
writes instructions using symbolic instruction codes (Figure 11-14). Examples of these codes include
A for addition, C for compare, L for load, and M for multiply.

Assembly languages also use symbolic addresses. A symbolic address is a meaningful name
that identifies a storage location. For example, a programmer can use the name RATE to refer to
the storage location that contains a pay rate.
Despite these advantages, assembly languages can be difficult to learn. In addition, program-
mers must convert an assembly language program into machine language before the computer
can execute, or run, the program. That is, the computer cannot execute the assembly source pro-
gram. A source program is the program that contains the language instructions, or code, to be
converted to machine language. To convert the assembly language source program into machine
language, programmers use a program called an assembler.
Procedural Languages
The disadvantages of machine and assembly (low-level) languages led to the development of
procedural languages in the late 1950s and 1960s. In a procedural language, the programmer
writes instructions that tell the computer what to accomplish and how to do it.
With a procedural language, often called a third-generation language (3GL), a programmer
uses a series of English-like words to write instructions. For example, ADD stands for addition or
PRINT means to print. Many 3GLs also use arithmetic operators such as * for multiplication and
+ for addition. These English-like words and arithmetic symbols simplify the program develop-
ment process for the programmer.
As with an assembly language program, the 3GL code (instructions) is called the source program.
Programmers must convert this source program into machine language before the computer can
execute the program. This translation process often is very complex, because one 3GL source pro-
gram instruction translates into many machine language instructions. For 3GLs, programmers
typically use either a compiler or an
interpreter to perform the translation.
A compiler is a separate program that
converts the entire source program into
machine language before executing it.
The machine language version that
results from compiling the 3GL is called
the object code or object program. The
compiler stores the object code on 
storage media for execution later.
While it is compiling the source pro-
gram into object code, the compiler
checks the source program for errors.
The compiler then produces a program
listing that contains the source code and
a list of any errors. This listing helps the
programmer make necessary changes 
to the source code and correct errors 
in the program. Figure 11-15 shows the
process of compiling a source program.
425
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
FIGURE 11-15
A compiler converts
the entire source program into a machine
language object program. If the compiler
encounters any errors, it records them in a
program-listing file, which the programmer
may print when the entire compilation is
complete. When a user wants to run the
program, the object program is loaded
into the memory of the computer and the
program instructions begin executing.

A compiler translates an entire program before executing
it. An interpreter, by contrast, translates and executes one
statement at a time. An interpreter reads a code statement,
converts it to one or more machine language instructions,
and then executes those machine language instructions. It
does this all before moving to the next code statement in the
program. Each time the source program runs, the interpreter
translates and executes it, statement by statement. An inter-
preter does not produce an object program. Figure 11-16
shows the process of interpreting a program.
One advantage of an interpreter is that when it finds
errors, it displays feedback immediately. The programmer
can correct any errors before the interpreter translates the
next line of code. The disadvantage is that interpreted pro-
grams do not run as fast as compiled programs. 
Hundreds of procedural languages exist. Only a few, how-
ever, are used widely enough for the industry to recognize
them as standards. These include COBOL and C. To illustrate
the similarities and differences among these programming
languages, the figures on the following pages show program
code in these languages. The code solves a simple payroll
problem — computing the gross pay for an employee. 
The process used to compute gross pay can vary from 
one system to another. The examples on the following pages
use a simple algorithm, or set of steps, to help you easily
compare one programming language with another.
COBOL
COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language) evolved out of a joint effort between
the United States government, businesses, and major universities in the early 1960s. Naval officer
Grace Hopper, a pioneer in computer programming, was a prime developer of COBOL.
COBOL is a programming language designed for business applications. Although COBOL
programs often are lengthy, their English-like statements make the code easy to read, write, and
maintain (Figure 11-17). COBOL especially is useful for processing transactions, such as payroll
and billing, on mainframe computers.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
C
The C programming language, developed 
in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell
Laboratories, originally was designed for writing
system software. Today, many programs are writ-
ten in C (Figure 11-18). C runs on almost any type
of computer with any operating system, but it is
used most often with the UNIX operating system.
Object-Oriented Programming Languages and Program Development Tools
Programmers use an object-oriented programming (OOP) language or object-oriented
program development tool to implement objects in a program. An object is an item that can 
contain both data and the procedures that read or manipulate that data. An object represents a
real person, place, event, or transaction.
A major benefit of OOP is the ability to reuse and modify existing objects. For example, once 
a programmer creates an Employee object, it is available for use by any other existing or future 
program. Thus, programmers repeatedly reuse existing objects. Programs developed using the
object-oriented approach have several advantages. The objects can be reused in many systems,
are designed for repeated use, and become stable over time. In addition, programmers create
applications faster because they design programs using existing objects. Programming languages,
such as Java, C++, and C#, are complete object-oriented languages.
Object-oriented programming languages and program development tools work well in a RAD
environment. RAD (rapid application development) is a method of developing software, in
which the programmer writes and implements a program in segments instead of waiting until
the entire program is completed.
An important concept in RAD is
the use of prebuilt components.
For example, programmers do not
have to write code for buttons and
text boxes on Windows forms
because they already exist in the
programming language or tools
provided with the language.
JAVA
Java is an object-oriented
programming language developed
by Sun Microsystems. Figure 11-19
shows a portion of a Java program
and the window that the program
displays.

When programmers compile a Java program, the resulting object code is machine independent.
Java uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to convert the machine-independent code into machine-
dependent code that is executed immediately. Programmers use various Java Platform implemen-
tations, developed by Sun Microsystems, which provide development tools for creating programs
for all sizes of computers. 
C++
Developed in the 1980s by Bjarne Sroustrup at Bell Laboratories, C++ (pronounced 
SEE-plus-plus) is an object-oriented programming language that is an extension of the C pro-
gramming language. C++ includes all the elements of the C language (shown in Figure 11-18 
on the previous page), plus it has additional features for working with objects. Programmers
commonly use C++ to develop database and Web applications.
C#
Based on C++, C# (pronounced SEE-sharp) is an object-oriented programming language that
was developed primarily by Anders Hejlsberg, Microsoft chief architect and distinguished engi-
neer. C# has been accepted as a standard for Web applications and XML-based Web services.
Many experts see C# as Java’s main competition.
VISUAL STUDIO
Visual Studio is Microsoft’s suite of program development tools that assists 
programmers in building programs for Windows, Windows Mobile, or any operating system 
that supports Microsoft’s .NET Framework. The Microsoft .NET Framework, or .NET (pronounced
dot net), is a set of technologies that allows almost any type of program to run on the Internet or
an internal business network, as well as stand-alone computers and mobile devices. 
This latest version of Visual Studio is an integrated development environment. An integrated
development environment (IDE) includes program development tools for building graphical
interfaces, an editor for entering program code, a compiler and/or interpreter, and a debugger (to
remove errors, which is discussed later in the chapter). Visual Studio also includes enhanced sup-
port for building security and reliability into applications through its programming languages,
RAD tools, a specialized query language, and other resources that reduce development time. For
example, Visual Studio includes code snippets, which are prewritten code and templates associ-
ated with common programming tasks. Visual Studio also includes a set of tools for developing
programs that work with Microsoft’s Office suite. The following paragraphs discuss these pro-
gramming languages in the Visual Studio suite: Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Visual C#.
• Visual Basic is based on the Visual Basic programming language, which was developed by
Microsoft Corporation in the early 1990s. This language is easy to learn and use. Thus, Visual
Basic is ideal for beginning programmers.
The first step in building a Visual Basic program often is to design the graphical user inter-
face using Visual Basic objects (Steps 1 and 2 in Figure 11-20). Visual Basic objects include items
such as buttons, text boxes, and labels. Next, the programmer writes instructions (code) to
define any actions that should occur in response to specific events (Step 3 in Figure 11-20).
Finally, the programmer generates and tests the final program (Step 4 in Figure 11-20).
• Visual C++ is a programming language based on C++. Not only is Visual C++ a powerful
object-oriented programming language, it enables programmers to write Windows, Windows
Mobile, and .NET applications quickly and efficiently. 
• Visual C# combines the programming elements of C++ with an easier visual programming
environment. The purpose of Visual C# is to take the complexity out of Visual C++.

DELPHI
Borland’s Delphi is a powerful program development tool that is ideal for building
large-scale enterprise and Web applications in a RAD environment. Programmers use Delphi
to develop programs quickly for Windows, Linux, and .NET platforms.
POWERBUILDER
PowerBuilder, developed by Sybase, is another powerful program
development RAD tool best suited for Web-based and large-scale enterprise object-oriented
applications. Programmers also use PowerBuilder to develop small- and medium-scale
client/server applications. 
VISUAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
A visual programming language is a language that uses 
a visual or graphical interface for creating all source code. The graphical interface, called a
visual programming environment (VPE), allows programmers to drag and drop objects to
build programs. Examples of visual programming languages include Alice, Mindscript, and
Prograph.

Other Programming Languages
Two programming languages also currently used that have not been discussed yet are RPG and
4GLs. The following sections discuss these programming languages.
RPG
In the early 1960s, IBM introduced RPG (Report Program Generator) to assist businesses
in generating reports (Figure 11-21). Today, businesses also use RPG to access and update data in
databases. RPG primarily is used for application development on IBM servers.
430
CHAPTER 11
INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
4GLS
A 4GL (fourth-generation language) is a nonprocedural language that enables users and
programmers to access data in a database. With a nonprocedural language, the programmer
writes English-like instructions or interacts with a graphical environment to retrieve data from
files or a database. Many object-oriented program development tools use 4GLs.
One popular 4GL is SQL. SQL is a query language that allows users to manage, update, and
retrieve data in a relational DBMS (Figure 11-22). 
FIGURE 11-22
SQL is a fourth-generation
language that can be used to query database
tables. This query produces an alphabetical list
of those employees who receive overtime pay;
that is, their overtime hours are greater than 0.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
Classic Programming Languages
In addition to the programming languages discussed on the previous pages, programmers
sometimes use other languages (Figure 11-23). Some of the languages listed in Figure 11-23,
although once popular, find little use today.
Ada
Derived from Pascal, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense,
named after Augusta Ada Lovelace Byron, who is thought to be the first
female computer programmer

Other Program Development Tools
As mentioned earlier, program development tools are user-friendly programs designed to assist
both programmers and users in creating programs. In many cases, the program automatically
generates the procedural instructions necessary to communicate with the computer. The following
sections discuss application generators and macros.
APPLICATION GENERATORS
An application generator is a program that creates source code or
machine code from a specification of the required functionality. When using an application genera-
tor, a programmer or user works with menu-driven tools and graphical user interfaces to define the
desired specifications. Application generators most often are bundled with or are included as part
of a DBMS.

An application generator typically consists of a report writer, form, and menu generator. A report
writer allows you to design a report on the screen, retrieve data into the report design, and then display
or print the report. Figure 11-24 shows a sample form design and the resulting form it generates show-
ing sample data a user may enter in the form. A menu generator enables you to create a menu for the
application options.

MACROS
A macro is a series of statements that instructs a program how to complete a task. Macros
allow users to automate routine, repetitive, or difficult tasks in application software such as word
processing, spreadsheet, or database programs. That is, users can create simple programs within the
software by writing macros. You usually create a macro in one of two ways: (1) record the macro or
(2) write the macro.
If you want to automate a routine or repetitive task such as formatting or editing, you would record
a macro. A macro recorder is similar to a movie camera because both record all actions until turned
off. To record a macro, start the macro recorder in the software. Then, perform the steps to be part of the
macro, such as clicks of the mouse or keystrokes. Once the macro is recorded, you can run it anytime
you want to perform that same sequence of actions. For example, if you always print three copies of
certain documents, you could record the actions required to print three copies. To print three copies,
you would run the macro called PrintThreeCopies.
When you become familiar with programming techniques, you can write your own macros instead
of recording them. Read Ethics & Issues 11-3 for a related discussion.
Who Should Be Held Accountable for Macro Security Threats?
In 1999, an individual downloaded and opened a small document from an Internet newsgroup. Upon opening the document, a macro was executed that
sent the same document to the first 50 e-mail addresses in the person’s e-mail contact list. The simple action of opening the document started a chain
reaction that resulted in more than 100,000 infected computers, more than $80 million in damage, Internet e-mail usage being clogged for days around
the world, and 20 months in prison for the creator of the document. The document contained a macro virus known as the Melissa worm. Thousands of
such macro viruses have circulated around the Internet. Malware authors find that one of the easiest ways to spread viruses and worms is through the
use of infected macros. The convenience and simplicity of macros are both their greatest strengths and weaknesses. These are weaknesses because
hackers find it easy to exploit technologies with such traits.
As a result of damaging macro viruses such as Melissa, antivirus companies and software companies have strengthened their efforts against macro
viruses. Companies often prohibit employees from running macros on their computers. Both responses have made the use of macros more difficult and
confusing for users, who prefer the convenience and simplicity of the earlier days. Many claim that software companies that include the capability to use
macros should be responsible for making it impossible for malware authors to take advantage of security problems in the software. Software compan-
ies and others blame users who open documents from unknown sources. Should users or software companies be held accountable for macro security
threats? Why? Should a macro in a word processing document have the capability to access a person’s e-mail contact list? Why or why not? How can
users best be educated regarding handling documents from unknown sources?

Web Page Development
The designers of Web pages, known as Web developers, use a variety of techniques to create
Web pages. The following sections discuss these techniques.
HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a special formatting language that programmers
use to format documents for display on the Web. You view a Web page written with HTML in a
Web browser such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Safari, Firefox, or Opera. Figure 11-25a shows
part of the HTML code used to create the Web page shown in Figure 11-25b.
HTML is not actually a programming language. It is, however, a language that has specific rules
for defining the placement and format of text, graphics, video, and audio on a Web page. HTML
uses tags, which are words, abbreviations, and symbols that specify links to other documents and
indicate how a Web page is displayed when viewed on the Web.

C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:30 PM  Page 433

SCRIPTS, APPLETS, SERVLETS, AND ACTIVEX CONTROLS
HTML tells a browser how to display 
text and images, set up lists and option buttons, and establish links on a Web page. By adding
dynamic content and interactive elements such as scrolling messages, animated graphics, forms,
pop-up windows, and interaction, Web pages become much more interesting. To add these ele-
ments, Web developers write small programs called scripts, applets, servlets, and ActiveX con-
trols. These programs run inside of another program. This is different from programs discussed
thus far, which are executed by the operating system. In this case, the Web browser executes 
these short programs.
One reason for using scripts, applets, servlets, and ActiveX controls is to add special multi-
media effects to Web pages. Examples include animated graphics, scrolling messages, calendars,
and advertisements. Another reason to use these programs is to include interactive capabilities 
on Web pages. 
SCRIPTING LANGUAGES
Programmers write scripts, applets, servlets, or ActiveX controls using a
variety of languages. These include some of the languages previously discussed, such as Java,
C++, C#, and Visual Basic. Some programmers use scripting languages. A scripting language is an
interpreted language that typically is easy to learn and use. Popular scripting languages include
JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Rexx, Tcl, and VBScript. 
• JavaScript is an interpreted language that allows a programmer to add dynamic content and
interactive elements to a Web page (Figure 11-26). These elements include alert messages,
scrolling text, animations, drop-down menus, data input forms, pop-up windows, and
interactive quizzes.

• Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language) originally was developed by Larry Wall at
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a procedural language similar to C and C++. The latest
release of Perl, however, is an interpreted scripting language. Because Perl has powerful text
processing capabilities, it has become a popular language for writing scripts.
• PHP, which stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, is a free, open source scripting language.
PHP is similar to C, Java, and Perl. 
• Rexx (REstructured eXtended eXecutor) was developed by Mike Cowlishaw at IBM as a
procedural interpreted scripting language for both the professional programmer and the
nontechnical user.
• Tcl (Tool Command Language) is an interpreted scripting language created by Dr. John
Ousterhout and maintained by Sun Microsystems Laboratories. 
• VBScript (Visual Basic, Scripting Edition) is a subset of the Visual Basic language that allows
programmers to add intelligence and interactivity to Web pages. As with JavaScript, Web 
developers embed VBScript code directly into an HTML document. 
DYNAMIC HTML
Dynamic HTML (DHTML) is a newer type of HTML that allows Web developers
to include more graphical interest and interactivity in a Web page. Typically, Web pages created with
DHTML are more animated and responsive to user interaction. Colors change, font sizes grow,
objects appear and disappear as a user moves the mouse (Figure 11-27), and animations dance
around the screen.

CHAPTER 11
INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
XHTML, XML, AND WML
XHTML (eXtensible HTML) is a markup language that enables
Web sites to be displayed more easily on microbrowsers in smart phones and other personal
mobile devices. XHTML includes features of HTML and XML. XML (eXtensible Markup
Language) is an increasingly popular format for sharing data that allows Web developers to
create customized tags, as well as use predefined tags. With XML, a server sends an entire
record to the client, enabling the client to do much of the processing without going back to 
the server. 
XML separates the Web page content from its format, allowing the Web browser to display
the contents of a Web page in a form appropriate for the display device. For example, a smart
phone, a notebook computer, and a desktop computer all could display the same XML page. 
Two applications of XML are the RSS 2.0 and ATOM specifications. RSS 2.0, which stands
for Really Simple Syndication, and ATOM are specifications that content aggregators use to
distribute content to subscribers.  The online publisher creates an RSS or ATOM document,
called a Web feed, that is made available to Web sites for publication. News Web sites, blogs,
and podcasts often use Web feeds to publish headlines and stories. Most Web browsers can
read Web feeds, meaning they automatically download updated content from Web pages 
identified in the feed.
Wireless devices use a subset of XML called WML. WML (wireless markup language) allows
Web developers to design pages specifically for microbrowsers. Many Internet-enabled smart
phones and PDAs use WML as their markup language. 
AJAX
Ajax, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a method of creating
interactive Web applications designed to provide immediate response to user requests. Instead
of refreshing entire Web pages, Ajax works with the Web browser to update only changes to
the Web page. This technique saves time because the Web application does not spend time
repeatedly sending unchanged information across the network. 
Ajax combines several programming tools: JavaScript, HTML or XHTML, and XML. Web 2.0
sites, which allow users to modify and share content and have application software built into the
site, often use Ajax. Examples of Web sites that use Ajax are Google Maps and Flickr.
RUBY ON RAILS
Ruby on Rails is an open source framework that provides technologies for
developing object-oriented, database-driven Web sites. Ruby on Rails is designed to make Web
developers more productive by providing them an easy-to-use environment and eliminating
time-consuming steps in the Web development process.

WEB PAGE AUTHORING SOFTWARE
As discussed in Chapter 3, you do not need to learn HTML
to develop a Web page. You can use Web page authoring software to create sophisticated Web
pages that include graphical images, video, audio, animation, and other special effects. Web
page authoring software generates HTML tags from your Web page design. 
FAQ 11-4
C6672_CH11_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:30 PM  Page 436

Four popular Web page authoring programs are Dreamweaver, Expression Web, Flash, and
Silverlight.
• Dreamweaver, by Adobe Systems, is a Web page authoring program that allows Web
developers to create, maintain, and manage professional Web sites.
• Expression Web is Microsoft’s Web page authoring program that enables Web developers to
create professional, dynamic, interactive Web sites. Expression Web integrates with Visual Studio.
• Flash, by Adobe Systems, is a Web page authoring program that enables Web developers to
combine interactive content with text, graphics, audio, and video.
• Silverlight, by Microsoft, is a Web page authoring program that also enables Web developers 
to combine interactive content with text, graphics, audio, and video.
Multimedia Program Development
Multimedia authoring software allows programmers to combine text, graphics, animation,
audio, and video into an interactive presentation. Many developers use multimedia authoring
software for computer-based training (CBT) and Web-based training (WBT). Popular multimedia
authoring software includes ToolBook and Director. Many businesses and colleges use ToolBook
to create content for distance learning courses (Figure 11-28).

CHAPTER 11
INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
The program development cycle is a series of steps programmers use to build computer programs.
As discussed, the system development cycle guides information technology (IT) professionals
through the development of an information system. Likewise, the program development cycle
guides computer programmers through the development of a program. The program development
cycle consists of six steps (Figure 11-29):
1. Analyze Requirements
2. Design Solution
3. Validate Design
4. Implement Design
5. Test Solution
6. Document Solution
As shown in Figure 11-29, the steps in the program development cycle form a loop. Program
development is an ongoing process within system development. Each time someone identifies errors
in or improvements to a program and requests program modifications, the Analyze Requirements
step begins again. When programmers correct errors (called bugs) or add enhancements to an exist-
ing program, they are said to be maintaining the program. Program maintenance is a ongoing activ-
ity that occurs after a program has been delivered to users. Read Ethics & Issues 11-4 for a related
discussion.

Software Factories Provide Low-Cost Programming Alternatives
As the need for new programs is increasing dramatically worldwide, the
supply of highly trained software writers is decreasing. To combat this
labor shortage, medium and large companies may rely on software
factories to reduce costs and increase program reliability.
Programmers currently write programs manually for many specific
applications. In contrast, software factories would rely on automation
to generate lines of code. In much the same fashion as a chef follows
a recipe using ingredients, the factories would assemble prewritten
models in a specific order to build, compile, test, and debug pro-
grams. Programmers then would modify the computer-generated
program to meet a specific organization’s needs.
Widgets, such as menus, check boxes, and buttons, that are packaged in widget toolkits are becoming
increasingly useful to help programmers build graphical user interfaces. For more information, visit
scsite.com/dcf5e/ch11/looking and then click Software Factories.
Who Is Responsible for Bugs?
The consequences of bugs, or errors, in computer programs can be staggering. A software error in a missile
defense system resulted in the deaths of 29 U.S. soldiers. An error in the code controlling a Canadian nuclear
facility caused more than 3,000 gallons of radioactive water to be spilled. A bug in long-distance switching soft-
ware cost AT&T more than $60 million. Some sources say that the Microsoft Windows Vista operating system
was considered ready for release when Microsoft reduced the number of known bugs to under 500. Experts esti-
mate that there are 20 to 30 bugs per 1,000 lines of code in an average program. Given that many programs con-
tain hundreds of thousands, even millions, of code lines, bugs are not surprising. Most software licenses absolve
the software creator of any responsibility for the end user getting the wrong information from a bug-riddled pro-
gram. Who should be responsible for mistakes in software? Why? If users provide incomplete or inaccurate
specifications, should they be held accountable for the resulting deficiencies? Why? Should those who design a
system or write programs for a system be legally responsible if their product results in errors or damages? Why?
What Initiates the Program Development Cycle?
As discussed, the system development cycle consists of five phases: planning; analysis; design;
implementation; and operation, support, and security. During the analysis phase, the develop-
ment team recommends how to handle software needs. Choices include purchasing packaged
software, building custom software in-house, or outsourcing some or all of the IT operation.
If the company opts for in-house development, the design and implementation phases of the
system development cycle become quite extensive. In the design phase, the analyst creates a
detailed set of requirements for the programmers. Once the programmers receive the require-
ments, the implementation phase begins. At this time, the programmer analyzes the requirements
of the problem to be solved. The program development cycle thus begins at the start of the imple-
mentation phase in the system development cycle.
The scope of the requirements largely determines how many programmers work on the program
development. If the scope is large, a programming team that consists of a group of programmers
may develop the programs. If the specifications are simple, a single programmer might complete
all the development tasks. Whether a single programmer or a programming team, all the pro-
grammers involved must interact with users and members of the development team throughout
the program development cycle.
By following the steps in the program development cycle, programmers create programs that
are correct (produce accurate information) and maintainable (easy to modify). Read Looking
Ahead 11-3 for a look at the future of software development.

SELECTION CONTROL STRUCTURE
A selection control structure tells the program which action 
to take, based on a certain condition. Two common types of selection control structures are the 
if-then-else and the case.
When a program evaluates the condition in an if-then-else control structure, it yields one of 
two possibilities: true or false. Figure 11-31 shows the condition as a diamond symbol. If the
result of the condition is true, then the program performs one action. If the result is false, the pro-
gram performs a different action. For example, the if-then-else control structure can determine if
an employee should receive overtime
pay. A possible condition might be the
following: Is Hours Worked greater
than 40? If the response is yes (true),
then the action would calculate over-
time pay. If the response is no (false),
then the action would set overtime pay
equal to 0.
In some cases, a program should 
perform no action if the result of a 
condition is false. This variation of the
if-then-else is called the if-then control
structure because the program per-
forms an action only if the result of the
condition is true.
With the case control structure, a con-
dition can yield one of three or more
possibilities (Figure 11-32). The size of 
a beverage, for example, might be one
of these options: small, medium, large,
or extra large. A case control struct-
ure would determine the price of the
beverage based on the size purchased.
Control Structures
When programmers are required to design the logic of a program, they typically use control
structures to describe the tasks a program is to perform. A control structure, also known as a 
construct, depicts the logical order of program instructions. Three basic control structures are
sequence, selection, and repetition.
SEQUENCE CONTROL STRUCTURE
A sequence control structure shows one or more actions
following each other in order (Figure 11-30). Actions include inputs, processes, and outputs. All
actions must be executed; that is, none can be skipped. Examples of actions are reading a record,
calculating averages or totals, and printing totals.

REPETITION CONTROL STRUCTURE
The repetition control structure enables a program to 
perform one or more actions repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met. Many program-
mers refer to this construct as a loop. Two forms of the repetition control structure are the 
do-while and do-until.
A do-while control structure repeats one or more times as long as a specified condition is true
(Figure 11-33). This control structure tests a condition at the beginning of the loop. If the result
of the condition is true, the program executes the action(s) inside the loop. Then, the program
loops back and tests the condition again. If the result of the condition still is true, the program
executes the action(s) inside the loop again.
This looping process continues until the con-
dition being tested becomes false. At that
time, the program stops looping and moves
to another set of actions.
The do-while control structure normally 
is used when the occurrence of an event is
not quantifiable or predictable. For example, 
programmers frequently use the do-while
control structure to process all records in a
file. A payroll program using a do-while con-
trol structure loops once for each employee.
This program stops looping after it processes
the last employee’s record. 
The do-until control structure is similar to
the do-while but has two major differences:
where it tests the condition and when it stops
looping. First, the do-until control structure
tests the condition at the end of the loop
(Figure 11-34).

The action(s) in a do-until control structure thus always will execute at least once. The loop in a
do-while control structure, by contrast, might not execute at all. That is, if the condition immedi-
ately is false, the action or actions in the do-while loop never execute. Second, a do-until control
structure continues looping until the condition is true — and then stops. This is different from the
do-while control structure, which continues to loop while the condition is true.
An understanding of these control structures provides an insight into the steps performed by a
computer when the computer is used to solve a problem or process data.

Programmer
If you are the curious, creative type, enjoy solving puzzles, and gain 
satisfaction in making things work, you may want to consider a career in
programming. A programmer designs, writes, and tests the code that tells
computers what to do. Most programmers specialize in one of three fields: 
system programming, application programming, or Web development 
programming.
Some jobs may require that the programmer develop an entire program, while other jobs require program
maintenance. Likewise, programmers can work for a small company in which they are responsible for the
entire system development cycle, or for a larger company in which they are part of a team and individual
duties are specialized. Projects can range from computer games to essential business applications. Program-
mers enjoy the achievements of working with computers to accomplish objectives as well as developing
efficient instructions that tell computers how to perform specific tasks.
Academic credentials are essential for success in this career. A bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or
Information Technology usually is required. The key to success is familiarity with programming languages
and a good foundation in programming logic. Surveys indicate that average salaries for entry level program-
mers are about $60,000 and can exceed $100,000 for senior programmers. For more information, visit

Grace Hopper
COBOL Developer
Women’s participation in the computer programming world was shaped by the achievements of Grace Hopper. She was one 
of the first software engineers, and in 1953 she perfected her best-known invention: the compiler.
After earning her Ph.D. degree from Yale University, she began teaching mathematics at Vassar College. She resigned that
position in 1943 to join the Navy WAVES (Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service). Her work developing compilers
ultimately led to the creation of the COBOL programming language.
Although her achievements are the foundation of today’s computers, she said during her lifetime that she was most proud
of her service to her country. Each year the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is held to focus on women’s
research and career interests in the technology fields. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch11/people and then click

James Gosling
Java Engineer and Architect
Known as the “father of Java,” James Gosling serves as Sun Microsystems Developer Products group’s chief technology officer.
He is the mastermind behind Java, the network programming language running across all platforms, from servers to cell phones.
Gosling grew up near Calgary, Alberta, and spent much of his spare time turning spare machine parts into games. At the age
of 15, he wrote software for the University of Calgary’s physics department. When he was hired at Sun Microsystems, he built a
multiprocessor version of UNIX, developed compilers to convert program code into machine language, engineered a window
manager, and wrote a UNIX text editor.
He received the Award of Distinction in Computer Science in 2007 for his contributions to the advancement of the profession
and society as a whole. He also became an officer of the Order of Canada for demonstrating an outstanding level of talent and
service to Canadians. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch11/people and then click James Gosling.

Chapter Review
The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students regarding
any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch11/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
Why Are Project Management, Feasibility Assessment, Documentation, Data and Information Gathering
Techniques, and Information System Security Important during System Development?
Project management is the process of planning, scheduling, and then controlling the activities during the system development
cycle. Feasibility is a measure of how suitable the development of a system will be to the company. Documentaton is the col-
lection and summarization of data and information. To gather data and information, IT professionals can review documenta-
tion, observe, distribute surveys, interview, participate in a joint-application design (JAD) session, and perform research. All
elements of an information system must be secure from threats both inside and outside the enterprise.
What Is the Purpose of Each Phase in the System Development Cycle?
Most system development cycles contain five phases. During the planning phase, a project
request is reviewed and approved, project requests are prioritized, resources are allocated, and 
a project development team is formed for each approved project. During the analysis phase, 
a preliminary investigation is conducted to determine the exact nature of the problem or
improvement, and detailed analysis is performed to study how the current system works, deter-
mine users’ requirements, and recommend a solution. During the design phase, any necessary
hardware and software are acquired, and the details of the new or modified information system
are developed. In the implementation phase, the new or modified system is constructed and
delivered to the users. During the operation, support, and security phase, ongoing assistance 
is provided for the information system and its users after the system is implemented.
How Are Low-Level Languages Different from Procedural Languages?
A low-level language is a programming language that runs on only one type of computer. Each instruction in a low-level
language usually equates to a single machine instruction. Procedural languages are high-level languages that can run on
many different types of computers and operating systems. In a procedural language, a programmer writes instructions
that tell the computer what to accomplish and how to do it.
What Are the Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming Languages and Program Development Tools?
Programmers use an object-oriented programming (OOP) language or object-oriented program development tool to
implement object-oriented design. A major benefit of OOP is the ability to reuse and modify existing objects, allowing
programmers to create applications faster. OOP languages include Java, C++, and C#. Often used in conjunction with OOP,
RAD (rapid application development) is a method of developing software, in which a programmer writes and implements
a program in segments instead of waiting until the entire program is completed. Visual Studio is Microsoft’s suite of
program development tools and includes Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Visual C#.
What Are Other Programming Languages and Other Program Development Tools?
Businesses use RPG to generate reports and access and update data in databases. A 4GL (fourth generation language) is 
a nonprocedural language that users and programmers use to access the data in a database. Other program development
tools include an application generator, which creates source code or machine code from a specification of the required
functionality, and a macro, which is a series of instructions that instructs an application how to complete a task.
How Are Web Pages Developed?
Web developers use a variety of techniques to develop Web pages. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a special
formatting language used to format documents for display on the Web. To add interactivity to Web pages, some program-
mers use a scripting language or dynamic HTML (DHTML). Other popular languages and tools include XHTML, XML,
WML, Ajax, and Ruby on Rails. Web developers also use Web page authoring software to create sophisticated Web pages,
including Dreamweaver, Expression Web, Flash, and Silverlight.

What Are the Six Steps in the Program Development Cycle?
The program development cycle is a series of steps programmers use to build computer programs. The program 
development cycle consists of six steps: (1) analyze requirements, (2) design solution, (3) validate design, (4) implement
design, (5) test solution, and (6) document solution.
What Are the Basic Control Structures Used in Designing Solutions to Programming Problems?
A control structure depicts the logical order of program instructions. Three basic control structures are the sequence
control structure, selection control structure, and repetition control structure.

Short Answer
Write a brief answer to each of the following questions.
Working Together
Working in a group of your classmates, complete the following team exercise.
1.
Choosing a programming language is an important decision. A poor choice can result in a program that is difficult, 
incompatible, or unproductive. Each member of your team should interview someone in the IT department of a local organi-
zation about recently developed software. What application was developed? What programming language was used? 
Why? What factors were important in selecting the programming language? Were other factors considered (such as the
expertise of available programmers)? In hindsight, was the best language chosen? Why or why not? Meet with your team 
to discuss the results of your interviews. Then, create a presentation to share your findings with the class.

Learn How To
Use the Learn How To activities to learn fundamental skills when using a computer and accompanying technology. Complete
the exercises and submit them to your instructor.
LEARN HOW TO 1: Conduct an Effective Interview
As you learned in this chapter, gathering information is a critical element in the system development cycle, because 
without accurate facts, it is unlikely that the finished system will perform in the desired manner. An important means 
of gathering information is the personal interview. Interviews are used in several stages throughout the system 
development cycle, and they must be thorough and comprehensive.
Prior to conducting an interview, you must determine that an interview is the best means for obtaining the
information you seek. You have learned a variety of ways to obtain information, and you should use each of them
appropriately. Because an interview interrupts a person’s work and takes time, you must be sure the information gained 
in the interview justifies this interruption. Once you have determined you should conduct an interview to gather
information required for system development, a variety of factors become relevant.
Goal: The most important element of a successful interview is for you to determine exactly what knowledge you hope 
to gain as a result of the interview. If you do not have a goal, you are unlikely to emerge from the interview with much
useful information.
Do Your Homework: You should complete a variety of preparatory steps that will help ensure a successful interview.
These steps include the following:
1. Gather as much information as you can from the fact-gathering processes that do not require an interview. Because an
interview takes a person’s time and interrupts work, you must be sure the information you are seeking is not available
from other sources. Additionally, if you ask someone questions to obtain information they know is available
elsewhere, you will lose credibility with them during the interview process.
2. Be sure you plan to interview the best person to obtain the information you need. To do this, you must research every
person you plan to interview and understand their job, their position within the department in which they work, the
knowledge they should possess relative to the information you need, the culture of their work environment, how the
system being developed relates to them, and an estimate of the cooperation you can expect from them. If someone is
the most knowledgeable person regarding a certain subject but is unwilling to share information other than with
trusted coworkers, you likely will be better served by talking to someone else.
3. Prepare the questions you want to ask prior to setting up the interview. In this way, you can have a good estimate of
the time required for the interview. While other questions will occur to you as the interview proceeds, you should
have a good idea of the questions you need answered to reach your goal.
4. Prior to setting an appointment for an interview, be sure the management personnel of the people you will interview
have approved. Because you will be disrupting employees’ work days, you must obtain management approval before
even asking for an appointment.
Make an Appointment: An appointment almost always is required. By making an appointment, you ensure the person
to be interviewed will be available. Normally you should request an appointment in writing, often through the use of 
e-mail. In this written request, you should set a time and place for the interview, inform the interviewee what you need 
to know, and establish an agenda with an estimated time. You must recognize that most people do not like to be inter-
viewed, so often you will not be seen as friendly. In addition, it might be possible that the system being developed could
eliminate or change the person’s job, and clearly this can establish an adversarial relationship. Your task when making an
appointment, then, is to establish credibility with the interviewee and set the stage for a successful interview.
Conducting the Interview: When conducting an interview, remember that you are the “intruder.” Therefore, you
should be polite, prompt, and attentive in the interview. Always understand the perspective of the person being inter-
viewed and understand his or her fears, doubts, and potential hostilities. Sometimes, the interviewee might feel he or
she is in conflict with you, so by listening closely and being aware of the body language, you should be able to discern
the amount of truth and the amount of hedging that is occurring. Some of the details of the interview of which you
should be aware are as follows:
C6672_CH11EOC_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:31 PM  Page 448

Learn How To
449
1. If possible, the interview should be conducted in a quiet environment with a minimum of interruptions. 
2. The demeanor should be open and friendly, but as noted you should not expect to be welcomed with open arms.
3. Your questions should directly address the goals of the interview. Do not expect the person being interviewed to
provide a tutorial. Your questions must generate answers that supply your information.
4. Your questions should be thought-provoking. Do not ask questions requiring a yes or no answer. Your questions
should not lead the interviewee to an answer — rather, the questions should be open-ended and allow the person to
develop the answer. As an interviewer, you never should argue with the person being interviewed, you should not
suggest answers or give opinions, you should ask straight-forward questions rather than compound questions, you
never should assign blame for any circumstance that might come up in the interview, and you must never interrupt
while the person is talking. Finally, you, as the interviewer, should not talk much. Remember, you are conducting the
interview to gain information and it is the person you are interviewing who has that information. Let him or her talk.
5. Listen carefully, with both your ears and your eyes. What you hear normally is most important, but body language
and other movements often convey information as well. Concentrate on the interviewee — expect that you will make
much more eye contact with the person than he or she will with you. Allow silences to linger — the normal impulse in 
a conversation is to fill the silence quickly; in an interview, however, if you are quiet, the person being interviewed
might think of additional information.
6. As you listen, concentrate on the interviewee — when points are being made, do not take notes because that will
distract from what the person is saying — stay focused. When the information has been conveyed, then jot down
something so that you will remember.
7. Throughout the interview, offer reinforcing comments, such as, “The way I understand what you just said is …” Make
sure when you leave the interview there are no misunderstandings between you and the person you interviewed.
8. Before you conclude the interview, be sure all your goals have been met. You likely will not have another opportunity
to interview the person, so ensure you have nothing further to learn from the person.
Follow-Up: After the interview, it is recommended you send a follow-up letter or e-mail message to the person you
interviewed to review the information you learned. This document should invite the interviewee to correct any errors
you made in summing up your findings. In addition, for all the people you interview, keep a log of the time and place
of the interview. In this way, if any questions arise regarding the interview, you will have a log.
Exercise

WHAT IS ENTERPRISE COMPUTING?
T
he term, enterprise, commonly describes a business or venture of any size. In this chapter,
the term enterprise refers to large multinational corporations, universities, hospitals,
research laboratories, and government organizations. Enterprise computing involves the
use of computers in networks that encompass a variety of different operating systems, protocols,
and network architectures. A typical enterprise consists of corporate headquarters, remote offices,
international offices, and hundreds of individual operating entities, called functional units. The
types of functional units within a typical manufacturing enterprise are accounting and finance,
human resources, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, customer service,

and information technology. Each type of functional unit has specialized requirements for its
information systems. These functional units are summarized later in this chapter.
Enterprises produce and gather enormous volumes of information regarding customer, supplier,
and employee activity. The information flows among an assortment of entities both inside and 
outside of the enterprise, and users consume the information during a variety of activities (Figure
12-1). Customers, suppliers, and employees interact with the enterprise in a number of ways, and
computers track each interaction. Each sale of a product, purchase of a piece of equipment, or 
paycheck generates activity involving information systems.
Large computers connected by vast networks allow the enterprise to manage and distribute
information quickly and efficiently.

Types of Enterprises
Figure 12-1 on pages 452 and 453 shows an example of an enterprise whose main focus is in the 
manufacturing sector. Examples of some other types of enterprises are listed below.
• Retail enterprises own a large number of stores in a wide geographical area and use their size to
obtain discounts on the goods they purchase; they then seek to sell the goods at a lower price
than smaller retailers.
• Manufacturing enterprises create goods on a large scale and then distribute and sell the goods to
consumers or other organizations.
• Service enterprises typically do not create or sell goods, but provide services for consumers or
other organizations. Examples include companies in the insurance, restaurant, and financial
industries.
• Wholesale enterprises seek to purchase and then sell large quantities of goods to other
organizations, usually at a lower cost than retail.
• Government enterprises include large city governments, state governments, and the departments
and agencies of the federal government.
• Educational enterprises include large universities or school systems that include executives,
instructors, and other service personnel and whose reach extends throughout a county, a state, or
the entire country.
Organizational Structure of an Enterprise
Most traditional enterprises are organized in a hierarchical manner. Figure 12-2 shows an 
example of an organization chart of a large manufacturing company. Managers at the first two 
levels at the top of the chart, including the chief executive officer (CEO), mainly concern them-
selves with strategic decisions and long-term planning. Read Looking Ahead 12-1 for a look at 
the changing roles of the next generation of CIOs.

C6672_CH12_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:32 PM  Page 454

In Figure 12-2, the chief operations officer (COO) manages the core activities. The supporting
activities include financial departments and information technology (IT) departments. The chief
financial officer (CFO) and the chief information officer (CIO) lead these supporting roles.
Each enterprise includes its own special needs and the organizational structure of every enter-
prise varies. Organizations may include all or some of the managers and departments shown in
Figure 12-2. 
Levels of Users in the Enterprise
In an enterprise, users of information typically fall into one of four categories: executive 
management, middle management, operational management, and nonmanagement employees
(Figure 12-3). The types of information that users require often depend on their employee level 
in the organization.

The CIO of the Future
The next generation of high-tech leaders will be faced with new challenges directly related to the 
multigenerational workforce and the global economy. Mergers, acquisitions, growth, and high turnover
influence a company’s technology needs, and the CIO must be ready to meet these demands to keep the
business competitive.
The workforce of changing demographics places new technology demands upon the company. Wikis,
blogs, virtual worlds, and mobile learning are commonplace among younger employees; in contrast,
employees near retirement age often are less familiar with the digital tools. The CIO must recognize each
group’s particular training and equipment needs.
Offshoring and mobile working create organizational challenges. The CIO must address these work-
ers’ expectations and responsibilities along with those of the on-site employees. Global performance is 
a direct result of building a sense of community among all workers by keeping them connected with
technology tools. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch12/looking and then click Future CIO.

CHAPTER 12
ENTERPRISE COMPUTING
How Managers Use Information
Enterprise information is the information gathered in the ongoing operations of an 
enterprise-sized organization. Enterprise information begins with the day-to-day transactions 
that occur within a company, such as sales receipts or time cards. The company gathers and stores
the information. Over time, employees collect, combine, and analyze the information. Ultimately,
the role of information gathered in this way is to allow managers to make better decisions.
All employees, including managers, in a company need accurate information to perform their
jobs effectively. Managers are responsible for coordinating and controlling an organization’s
resources. Resources include people, money, materials, and information. Managers coordinate
these resources by performing four activities: planning, organizing, leading, and controlling.
• Planning involves establishing goals and objectives.
• Organizing includes identifying and combining resources, such as money and people, so that
the company can reach its goals and objectives. 
• Leading, sometimes referred to as directing, involves communicating instructions and
authorizing others to perform the necessary work.
• Controlling involves measuring performance and, if necessary, taking corrective action.
Managers utilize a variety of tools and techniques to focus on information that is important to
the decision-making process. These tools and techniques include business intelligence, business
process management, and business process automation.
Business intelligence (BI) includes several types of applications and technologies for acquir-
ing, storing, analyzing, and providing access to information to help users make more sound busi-
ness decisions. BI applications include decision support systems, query and reporting, online
analytical processing (OLAP), statistical analysis, and data mining. These activities are described
later in this chapter.
Business process management (BPM) includes a set of activities that enterprises perform to
optimize their business processes, such as accounting and finance, hiring employees, and pur-
chasing goods and services. BPM almost always is aided by specialized software designed to
assist in these activities.
Business process automation (BPA) provides easy exchange of information among business
applications, reduces the need for human intervention in processes, and utilizes software to auto-
mate processes wherever possible. BPA offers greater efficiency and reduces risks by making
processes more predictable.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE ENTERPRISE
An information system is a set of hardware, software, data, people, and procedures that work
together to produce information (Figure 12-4). A procedure is an instruction, or set of instructions,
a user follows to accomplish an activity. For example, a company may have a procedure for its
payroll system that includes a manager filling out certain forms before a new employee is added
to the payroll system.
Information systems can be used in a variety of ways in an enterprise. Some information sys-
tems are used exclusively by only one type of department, or functional unit, within the enter-
prise. General purpose information systems include categories of information systems that can 
be used by almost any department within the enterprise. Integrated information systems are 
used by multiple departments and facilitate information sharing and communication within the
enterprise. The following sections discuss each of these three uses of information systems.

ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
Figure 12-6 illustrates the separate functions of accounting and 
financial systems used by accounting and finance departments. Accounting software manages
everyday transactions, such as sales and payments to suppliers. Billing software helps the com-
pany reconcile purchases with customer payments. Financial software helps managers budget,
forecast, and analyze. These types of software include comprehensive and flexible reporting tools
to assist managers in making decisions, provide historical documentation, and meet regulatory
requirements.

HUMAN RESOURCES
A human resources information system (HRIS) manages one or more human
resources functions (Figure 12-7). A human resources information system and its associated software
help a company such as Wal-Mart maintain records on its more than 1.8 million employees. For
example, when many retail employees arrive at work, they check in using an electronic clock that
automatically allows managers to know who is late, early, or on time. The payroll department then
can use this information when determining employee pay.

Management.
WEB LINK 12-2
An employee relationship management (ERM) system automates and manages much of the 
communications between employees and the business. For example, an employee may interact 
with employee relationship management software to gather information regarding the employee’s
retirement account. Most employee relationship management software includes a Web interface 
for the employees and the human resources personnel, allowing both to interact with the system
when they are in the office or at home.
ENGINEERING OR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Professional workers, such as engineers, require specialized
software and systems to perform their tasks. Computer-aided design (CAD) uses a computer and 
special software to aid in product design. 
Computer-aided engineering (CAE) uses computers to test product designs. Using CAE, engineers
can test the design of a car or bridge before it is built. These sophisticated programs simulate the effects
of wind, temperature, weight, and stress on product shapes and materials. Engineers sometimes use 
3-D visualization, which allows them to interact with a product without the need to build a prototype.
MANUFACTURING
Manufacturing information systems and software not only assist in the actual
assembly process, but also assist in scheduling and managing the inventory of parts and products.
Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) is the use of computers to control production equipment.
CAM production equipment includes software-controlled drilling, lathe, welding, and milling
machines.
Computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) uses computers to integrate the many different 
operations of the manufacturing process, using such technologies as CAD, CAE, and CAM
(Figure 12-8).
Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is an approach to information management in a 
manufacturing environment that uses software to help monitor and control processes related to 
production. MRP focuses on issues related to inventory of parts and forecasting future demand so
that materials needed for manufacturing can be on hand when they are needed. 
QUALITY CONTROL
A quality control system helps an organization maintain or improve the quality
of its products or services. A quality control system usually includes quality control software.
Quality control software typically requires a great deal of continuous data gathering from the organi-
zation’s ongoing processes. Using statistical analysis, the software can find and predict product
defects and problems with the company’s processes. While quality control systems often are costly
and disruptive to the organization, the organization typically saves more money by producing a
higher quality product or service. 
C6672_CH12_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:32 PM  Page 459

MARKETING A marketing information system serves as a central repository for the tasks of the
marketing functional unit. One type of marketing information system is a market research system,
which stores and analyzes data gathered from demographics and surveys. Market research soft-
ware assists in target marketing by allowing marketing personnel to query databases based on 
criteria such as income, gender, previous purchases, and favorite recreational activities. 
SALES
Sales force automation (SFA) software equips traveling salespeople with the electronic
tools they need to be more productive. Sales force automation software helps salespeople manage
customer contacts, schedule customer meetings, log customer interactions, manage product 
information, and take orders from customers.
Sales force automation software (Figure 12-9) often runs on notebook computers or other per-
sonal mobile devices. The notebook computer or other personal mobile device may connect wire-
lessly to the central office, allowing the salesperson to access up-to-date corporate information in
real time no matter where he or she is located.
Some sales force automation programs allow the salesperson to upload information to the 
central office at the end of the day or end of the week. The programs also allow salespeople to
download updated product and pricing information.

DISTRIBUTION
Distribution systems provide forecasting for inventory control, manage and track
shipping of products, and provide information and analysis on inventory in warehouses. Some
distribution systems rely on GPS and other navigation technologies to track shipping in real time.
Many companies now employ RFID to track inventory and shipping. Because of the complexity
of the tasks of inventory management and shipping, distribution systems often integrate with
quality control systems. 
CUSTOMER SERVICE
Customer interaction management (CIM) software manages the day-to-day
interactions with customers, such as telephone calls, e-mail interactions, Web interactions, and
instant messaging sessions. These interactions are logged so that a historical record of interactions
with the customer can be viewed or analyzed at any time. A customer interaction management
program routes customer telephone calls and support queries from the company’s customer sup-
port Web site to the most appropriate support person depending on the identity of the customer
or responses the customer gives to prompts. Customer interaction management software also
assists support personnel in providing the best solutions for customers.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE ENTERPRISE
When should I supply personal information to a company?
Companies gather personal information about consumers for a variety of reasons. Companies can gather information when you make a
purchase, complete a survey, or enter a sweepstakes. Unless you are sure you want the company to communicate with you in some way,
few reasons exist to supply personal information to a company. Ask the company why it needs the information and use your judgment.
Most companies can supply you with a privacy policy upon request. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch12/faq and then click
Sharing Personal Information.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
The information technology department makes technology decisions for
the enterprise, such as a decision whether to build or buy new customer interaction management
information systems or when a computer or information system has outlived its useful life. Many
organizations elevate the importance of information technology by including a chief information 
officer (CIO) executive position that reports to the CEO.
General Purpose Information Systems
Some information systems in an enterprise cross the boundaries of functional units. These general
purpose, or enterprise-wide, systems become necessary in an enterprise for two reasons. First, func-
tional units within an enterprise have a significant need to share data among the units. Second,
enterprise-wide systems can collect and combine data more quickly and provide executive manage-
ment access to a more up-to-date and accurate view of what is happening in the organization.
Advances in computing speed, storage capacity, security, and networking have made enterprise-
wide systems more attractive to organizations in recent years.
General purpose information systems generally fall into one of five categories: office information
systems, transaction processing systems, management information systems, decision support systems,
and expert systems. The following sections present each type of these general purpose information
systems.
OFFICE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
An office information system (OIS) is an information system that
enables employees to perform tasks using computers and other electronic devices, instead of manu-
ally. An office information system increases employee productivity and assists with communications
among employees. Some people describe an office information system as office automation. 
An office information system supports many administrative activities. With this type of system, users
create and distribute graphics and documents, send messages, schedule appointments, browse the Web,
and publish Web pages. All levels of users utilize and benefit from the features of an office information
system.
An office information system uses many common software products to support its activities.
Typical software in an office information system includes word processing, spreadsheet, database,
presentation graphics, e-mail, Web browser, Web page authoring, personal information management,
and groupware. To send text, graphics, audio, and video to others, an office information system uses
communications technology such as voice mail, fax, and video conferencing. 
TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
A transaction processing system (TPS) is an information system
that captures and processes data from day-to-day business activities. 
Transaction processing systems were among the first computerized systems that processed business
data. Many people initially referred to the functions of a transaction processing system as data process-
ing. The first transaction processing systems computerized an existing manual system. The intent of
these transaction processing systems was to process faster, reduce clerical costs, and improve customer
service. 
Early TPSs mostly used batch processing. With batch processing, the computer collects data over time
and processes all transactions later, as a group. As computers became more powerful, system developers
created online transaction processing information systems. With online transaction processing (OLTP),
the computer processes each transaction as it is entered. Today, most transaction processing systems use
online transaction processing.
FAQ 12-1
C6672_CH12_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:32 PM  Page 461

For example, when you register for classes at school or from home
using the school’s Web site (Figure 12-10), your school probably uses
online transaction processing. You use the school’s Web site to enter
your desired schedule. The Web site immediately displays your 
statement of classes and sends you a schedule. 
When you make a purchase with a credit card at a store, you are inter-
acting with a transaction processing system. A transaction is an individ-
ual business activity. Examples of transactions are deposits, payments,
orders, and reservations. Transactions take place in real time, meaning
that as soon as you make a purchase with a credit card, you can visit
your credit card company’s Web site and view the transaction. In an
organization, clerical staff typically uses computers and special software
to perform activities associated with a transaction processing system.
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
A management information system (MIS) is an information
system that generates accurate, timely, and organized information, so that managers and other
users can make decisions, solve problems, supervise activities, and track progress. 
Management information systems often are integrated with transaction processing systems. To
process a sales order, the transaction processing system records the sale, updates the customer’s
account balance, and reduces the inventory count. Using this information, the related management
information system produces reports that recap daily sales activities, summarize weekly and
monthly sales activities, list customers with past due account balances, chart slow- or fast-selling
products, and highlight inventory items that need reordering. 
A management information system creates three basic types of reports: detailed, summary, and
exception (Figure 12-11). A detailed report usually lists just transactions. For example, a Detailed
Course Report lists courses available during a given period. A summary report consolidates data
usually with totals, tables, or graphs, so that managers can review it quickly and easily.

463
INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN THE ENTERPRISE
An exception report identifies data outside of a normal condition. These out-of-the-ordinary
conditions, called the exception criteria, define the normal activity or status range. For example, a
Lack of Enrollment Exception Report notifies the registrar’s office that some courses have not met
minimum enrollment requirements. 
Exception reports save managers time. Instead of searching through a detailed report,
managers simply review the exception report. These reports help managers focus on situations
that require immediate decisions or actions. Most information systems support all three types 
of reports shown in Figure 12-11.
DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
A decision support system (DSS) helps users analyze data and
make decisions. Often, a transaction processing system or management information system does
not generate the type of report a manager needs to make a decision. 
Programs that analyze data, such as those in a decision support system, sometimes are called
online analytical processing (OLAP) programs. A decision support system uses data from internal
and external sources. Internal sources of data might include sales orders, Material Requirements
Planning results, inventory records, or financial data from accounting and financial analyses.
Data from external sources could include interest rates, population trends, costs of new housing
construction, or raw material pricing.
Some decision support systems include their own query languages, statistical analyses, spread-
sheets, and graphics that help users retrieve data and analyze the results. Some also allow managers
to create a model of the factors affecting a decision. A product manager might need to decide on a
price for a new product. A simple model for finding the best price would include factors for the
expected sales volume at various price levels. The model allows the user to ask what-if questions
and view the expected results. 
A special type of decision support system, called an executive information system (EIS), sup-
ports the strategic information needs of executive management. An executive information system
presents information as charts and tables that show trends, ratios, and statistics (Figure 12-12).

EXPERT SYSTEMS
An expert system is an information system that captures and stores the 
knowledge of human experts and then imitates human reasoning and decision making. Figure 
12-13 shows how one expert system assists with diagnosing a computer problem in Windows Vista.
Expert systems consist of two main components: a knowledge base and inference rules. A
knowledge base is the combined subject knowledge and experiences of the human experts. The
inference rules are a set of logical judgments that are applied to the knowledge base each time a
user describes a situation to the expert system.

Expert systems are one aspect of an exciting branch of computer science called artificial 
intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the application of human intelligence to computers. 
Artificial intelligence technology senses a person’s actions and, based on logical assumptions and
prior experience, takes the appropriate action to complete the task. Artificial intelligence has a vari-
ety of capabilities, including speech recognition, logical reasoning, and creative responses. New
research in the field of artificial intelligence tries to mimic the way that human memory works in
order to expedite searches for information. Artificial intelligence has been used to play world-class
chess, as well as in robots that manufacture complex goods, such as computers and automobiles.
Enterprises employ expert systems in a variety of roles, such as answering customer questions,
training new employees, and analyzing data.
Integrated Information Systems
It often is difficult to classify an information system as belonging to only one of the five 
general types of information systems. Much of today’s application software supports transaction
processing and creates management information system reports. Other applications provide
transaction processing, management information, and decision support.
ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) provides centralized,
integrated software applications to help manage and coordinate the ongoing activities of the
enterprise, including manufacturing and distribution, accounting, finance, sales, product plan-
ning, and human resources. Figure 12-14 shows how ERP fits into the operations of an enterprise.

throughout a 
business. 
C6672_CH12_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:32 PM  Page 465

The enterprise resource planning system installed at each organization must be customized to match
the business requirements of the enterprise. At a large company, an enterprise resource planning sys-
tem may take four to six years to implement and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The organiza-
tion hopes to regain the investment through the advantages offered by enterprise resource planning.
Advantages of enterprise resource planning include complete integration of information systems
across departments, better project management, and better customer service. Better and faster
reporting of the state of the enterprise leads managers to better decisions. Enterprise resource plan-
ning also helps to better manage the global nature of many enterprises. The reliance on one informa-
tion system, rather than up to several hundred systems, allows the information technology
department to focus on one type of technology and simplifies relationships with 
information technology vendors. 
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT
A customer relationship management (CRM) system
manages information about customers, interactions with customers, past purchases, and interests.
Customer relationship management mainly is used across sales, marketing, and customer service
departments. Customer relationship management software tracks leads and inquiries from cus-
tomers, stores a history of all correspondence and sales to a customer, and allows for tracking of
outstanding issues with customers. 
CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
A content management system (CMS) is an information system
that is a combination of databases, software, and procedures that organizes and allows access to
various forms of documents and other files, including images and multimedia content. The content
management system also provides security controls for the content, such as who is allowed to add,
view, and modify content and on which content the user is allowed to perform those operations
(Figure 12-15). Publishing entities, such as news services, use content management systems to keep
Web sites up-to-date.

ENTERPRISE-WIDE TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODOLOGIES
ENTERPRISE-WIDE TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODOLOGIES
Several technologies adopted by enterprises allow them the flexibility and the ability to move
swiftly in a business environment. Some of the common technologies used in enterprises include
portals, electronic data interchange, data warehouses, extranets, Web services, workflow, and 
virtual private networks. Most of the hardware and software that contains these technologies is
located in a data center, which is a centralized location for managing and housing those items.
The following sections discuss each of these technologies.
Portals
A portal is a collection of 
links, content, and services 
presented on a Web page
and designed to guide
users to information they
likely are to find interest-
ing for their particular job
function. A portal often
includes searching capabil-
ities or a link to a search
engine, such as Google.
Organizations often deploy
enterprise search technol-
ogy that allows users to
perform searches across
many enterprise-wide
information systems and
databases. Users typically
can customize the portal
Web site to meet their
needs. 
Information from
external sources included
on a portal Web page can
include weather, news, ref-
erence tools, and instant
messaging (Figure 12-16).

C6672_CH12_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:32 PM  Page 467

Communications
The IT department, headed by the CIO, builds and maintains the electronic communications
infrastructure of the enterprise. The communications infrastructure consists of hardware, software,
and procedures. Examples of hardware include wired network connections, wireless network
devices, routers, firewalls, servers, and a variety of long distance communications connections.
Software can include e-mail, instant messaging, VoIP, and software applications to remotely manage
servers and end users’ computers. Procedures include the methods for using and managing the
hardware and software.
In addition to the communications software used by end users in the enterprise, the IT depart-
ment manages the software on servers to support the end users’ programs. For example, the IT
department manages e-mail servers that are used by the end users’ e-mail programs. 
For e-commerce, specialized software often is used to communicate with other computers. EDI
(electronic data interchange) is a set of standards that controls the transfer of business data and
information among computers both within and among enterprises. Today, businesses use these
standards to communicate with industry partners over the Internet and telephone lines.
Data Warehouses
A data warehouse is a huge database that stores and manages the data required to analyze 
historical and current transactions. Software applications such as enterprise resource planning
programs store and access data in a data warehouse. 
Most data warehouses include one or more databases and one or more information systems 
storing data in the data warehouse. The data in the databases consists of transaction data required
for decision making. This data may come from internal or external sources (Figure 12-17). Some
data warehouses use Web farming for their external data. Web farming is the process of collecting
data from the Internet as a source for the data warehouse.

C6672_CH12_pp3.qxd  1/30/08  2:32 PM  Page 468

Another growing external source of information is a click stream. A click stream is a collection
of every action that users make as they move through a Web site. By analyzing visitors’ click
streams, companies identify consumer preferences and determine which Web pages are most
attractive to visitors. 
Extranets
An extranet is the portion of a company’s network that allows customers or suppliers of a 
company to access parts of an enterprise’s intranet. An extranet provides a secure, physical con-
nection to the company’s network. Customers may use the extranet to place and monitor orders
electronically or to make payments. Suppliers may check inventory levels of the parts they supply
to the company and receive orders and payments from the company. Extranets improve efficiency
by replacing the postal service, faxes, or telephone calls as the communications medium of choice. 
Web Services
Web services include a relatively new set of software technologies that allows businesses to 
create products and B2B (business-to-business) interactions over the Internet. Web services do not
include traditional user interfaces, such as a Web page. Rather, users build their own interfaces 
to the Web services when necessary. Two popular platforms for building and running Web services
are the Sun Microsystems Java EE platform and the Microsoft .NET Framework. 
For example, an airline company may provide up-to-the-minute flight status information as a Web
service (Figure 12-18). Travel Web sites, such as Expedia or Orbitz, can query the Web service and
then display the information on their own Web pages for their customers. The travel Web site may
ask for the status of a particular flight and receive back a scheduled departure or arrival time from
the Web service. How the travel Web site then uses that information is of no concern to the Web 
service. The travel Web site may display the information to a customer who requested the informa-
tion or it may send an e-mail
notification with the informa-
tion to the customer. Typically,
the customer or consumer of the
Web service — the travel Web
site in this example — must
write a program to use the 
Web service.
Workflow
A workflow is a defined
process that identifies the 
specific set of steps involved 
in completing a particular 
project or business process. 
A workflow may be a written
set of rules or a set of rules that
exists in an information system.
A workflow application is 
a program that assists in the
management and tracking of
all the activities in a business
process from start to finish.
Enterprises use workflow
applications to assist in 
defining complex workflows.

Virtual Private Network
Many companies today allow access to their company networks through a virtual private
network. When a mobile user, remote office, vendor, or customer connects to a company’s network
using the Internet, a virtual private network (VPN) provides them with a secure connection to the
company network server, as if they had a private line. Virtual private networks help to ensure that
transmitted data is safe from being intercepted by unauthorized people (Figure 12-19). VPNs
securely extend the company’s internal network beyond the physical boundaries of the company.
The secure connection created over the Internet between the user’s computer and the company’s
network is called a VPN tunnel. Many companies allow external access to their internal networks
only via a VPN connection.

E-COMMERCE
Several market sectors have taken advantage of business opportunities on the Web. The more popular
market segments include retail, finance, health, entertainment and media, and travel. The following
paragraphs describe how the general public interacts with each of these types of enterprises on the Web.
E-Retailing
Retailing is one of the more visible market sectors of e-commerce. In retail, merchants sell products
and services directly to a buyer. E-retail, also called e-tail, occurs when retailers use the Web to sell
their products and services. Enterprises have adopted e-retail as a new way to reach customers.
Figure 12-20 shows how an e-retail transaction might occur.
For example, a customer (consumer) visits an online business at the company’s electronic store-
front and adds items to a shopping cart. When ready to complete the sale, the customer proceeds 
to the checkout. At this time, the customer enters personal and financial data through a secure Web
connection from his or her computer or personal mobile device. The transaction and financial data 
automatically are verified by the company’s bank over a secure connection from the company to 
the bank. Several methods are available through which a company can accept payments from a 
customer. 
If the bank or merchant account provider approves the transaction, the customer receives a confir-
mation notice of the purchase. Then, the e-retailer processes the order and sends it to the fulfillment
center where it is packaged and shipped. Inventory systems then are updated. The e-retailer notifies
the bank of the shipment, and payment is sent via electronic channels to the e-retailer. Shipping
information is posted on the Internet, so that the customer can track the order from their computer
or personal mobile device. The customer typically receives the order a few days after the purchase.

Who Can You Trust When Making Purchases Online?
When you walk into a store, at some point in your shopping experience you almost always interact with a person
directly. The online shopping experience, however, distances you from a seller who may be five hundred or five
thousand miles away. For many consumers, this type of nonhuman transaction can be a source of stress and
concern about the trustworthiness of the merchant. For some merchants, the distance and anonymity of the
Internet is an ideal climate for finding unknowing victims for unscrupulous activity, such as fraud. Consumer
advocates and government agencies recommend many ways to avoid a bad online shopping experience. When
you provide personal information, make sure that you are dealing with a secure Web site whose address begins
with https:// rather than http://. Check the site’s credentials, which may include seals from Truste, the Better
Business Bureau (BBB), or other certifying organizations. Make sure that the price you pay matches the price
listed on the site and that you are not paying too much for shipping your order. When available, check reviews of
the merchant offered by other consumers, but be aware that many merchants try to offer phony, positive reviews
of themselves. Finally, make it a habit to rate merchants as often as possible so that others can learn from your
experience. When you shop online, how do you go about determining which online merchants are trustworthy?
How do the methods that you use differ from merchants you visit when you walk into a store for the first time?
Are consumer advocacy groups or the government the better choice for regulating online transactions? Why?

Finance
Financial institutions include any business that manages the circulation of money, grants credit,
makes investments, or meets banking needs. These include banks, mortgage companies, broker-
age firms, and insurance companies. In the past, financial institutions were strictly traditional
bricks-and-mortar institutions. Today, many also conduct business on the Internet. 
Online banking allows users to pay bills from their computer or personal mobile
device, that is, transfer money electronically from their account to a payee’s account
such as the electric company or telephone company. At anytime, online banking users
also can download or view trans-actions such as cleared checks, ATM withdrawals, and
deposits, which allows them to have an up-to-date bank statement.
With online trading, users invest in stocks, options, bonds, treasuries, certificates of
deposit, money markets, annuities, mutual funds, and so on — without using a broker.
Many investors prefer online stock trading because the transaction fee for each trade
usually is substantially less than when trading through a broker.
Health
Many Web sites provide up-to-date medical, fitness, nutrition, or exercise information.
As with any other information on the Web, users should verify the legitimacy of the
Web site before relying on its information.
Some of these health-related Web sites maintain databases of doctors and dentists to
help individuals find the one who suits their needs. They also may have chat rooms, so
that people can talk to others diagnosed with similar conditions. 
Many health-care providers offer online services for patients, such as online diagnosis, prescrip-
tions, appointment booking, and the capability to view their health history. Physicians often com-
municate with patients through e-mail in order to speed up communications and minimize office
visits. Read Looking Ahead 12-2 for a look at the next generation of smart health devices.
Many bricks-and-mortar pharmacies have an online counterpart that exists on the Web, allowing
customers to refill prescriptions and ask pharmacists questions using customer interaction manage-
ment software. Some Web sites even allow consumers to order prescriptions online and have them
delivered directly to their door.

Health Devices Automate Patients’ Care
A cybertooth and a remote health monitor may be just what the doctor ordered to ensure the well-being of a special
class of patients.
Researchers in Tel Aviv are creating the cybertooth to dispense medicine to chronic patients who often forget to
take their medications. The oral device attaches to a tooth as a type of crown or as an implant. When the specified
time occurs, a panel on the cybertooth opens to release a dosage programmed by the patient’s physician. The
device can contain several weeks of dosages and can release multiple medicines.
IBM and the University of Florida are partnering to develop a smart device that lets doctors monitor patients’ health remotely. When
patients take their blood pressure or test their glucose levels, the readings will be sent automatically to a health-care professional. The 
collected data will be helpful to build a complete health history. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch12/looking and then click

Entertainment and Media
The technology behind the Web has enabled entertainment and media to take many forms. Music,
videos, news, sporting events, and 3-D multiplayer games are a growing part of the Web’s future.
Newsprint on the Web is not replacing the newspaper, but enhancing it and reaching different pop-
ulations. Read Ethics & Issues 12-2 for a related discussion. Streaming technology currently supports

the music files directly to a computer hard disk, allowing them to listen to the purchased music 
immediately from a computer or any portable media player. 
Not only do entertainment companies benefit from the ease of distributing electronic content, other
industries use electronic media in a variety of ways. Companies provide interactive online tutorials
regarding the use and care of their products. Consumers can find and download lost manuals for
products. Interactive online advertising and seminars allow companies to pitch their products to a
wider audience of consumers who show an interest in the companies’ products. 
Does Availability of News on the Web Threaten the Daily Newspaper?
For more than a decade, pundits have predicted the demise of the daily newspaper, claiming that people could get more news for free on the
Web, and that most people would opt for the convenience of the Web over a printed newspaper. Large media companies have been merging and
trimming down their staff. Furthermore, few have devised a formula to make publishing news on the Web as profitable a venture as selling
printed newspapers. In fact, many media companies lose money when it comes to making their news available on the Web. Many large newspa-
pers now employ half the number of reporters that they did before news became popular on the Web. During that time frame, total newspaper
circulation decreased, but only by approximately 10 percent. 
Many in the industry blame news consolidation Web sites, such as Google News, for misappropriating their news stories. Others blame
bloggers, who typically are not trained journalists, for driving consumers away from newspapers by sensationalizing news, adding editorial
content, and engaging in poor reporting practices that simply entice readers rather than educate them. Some industry analysts believe that
the decline in newspaper circulation is due to natural industry consolidation. The phenomenon also may be a result of the rise of 24-hour
news television channels in conjunction with the Web. How does the availability of news on the Web affect your news reading habits? Does
blogging and the drop in the number of reporters cause a decline in the quality of the news that people may be reading? Why or why not?
Travel
The Web provides many travel-related
services. If you need directions, you sim-
ply can enter a starting point and destina-
tion, and many Web sites provide detailed
directions along with a map. Users can
make airline reservations and reserve a
hotel or car. 
Some of these Web sites are shopping
bots that save users time by doing all the
investigative cost-comparison work. A
shopping bot is a Web site that searches
the Internet for the best price on a prod-
uct or service in which you are interested
(Figure 12-21).
Other Business Services
Enterprises use the Web to provide
services to consumers and other busi-
nesses. Public relations, online advertising,
direct mail, recruiting, credit, sales, market
research, technical support, training, soft-
ware consulting, and Internet access 
represent a few of the areas of service.

RAID
For applications that depend on reliable data access, users must have the data available when
they attempt to access it. Some manufacturers provide a type of hard disk system that connects
several smaller disks into a single unit that acts like a single large hard disk. As you learned in
Chapter 6, a group of two or more integrated hard disks is called a RAID (redundant array of
independent disks). Although quite expen-
sive for large computers, RAID is more reli-
able than traditional hard disks (Figure
12-22). Networks and Internet servers often 
use RAID. 
A RAID system duplicates data, instruc-
tions, and information to improve data relia-
bility. The simplest RAID storage design,
called mirroring, writes data on two disks at
the same time to duplicate the data. This
configuration enhances storage reliability
because, if a disk should fail, a duplicate of
the requested item is available elsewhere
within the array of disks. Some personal
computers now include RAID storage.
FIGURE 12-22
A group of two or more integrated hard
disks, called a RAID (redundant array of independent disks),
often is used with network servers. Shown here is a rack-
mounted RAID chassis including the hard disks.
What types of information do Web site management programs track?
Web site management programs, which are free or may be purchased for a fee, collect data designed to help
companies make informed decisions regarding their Web presence. This data might include the locations of their
Web site visitors, what Web browser they use, the days and times they visit the Web site, and what keywords
they entered into a search engine to locate the site. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch12/faq and

Network Attached Storage and Storage Area Networks
Network attached storage (NAS) is a server that is placed on a network with the sole purpose
of providing storage to users and information systems attached to the network (Figure 12-23a). A
network attached storage server often is called a storage appliance because it is a piece of equip-
ment with only one function — to provide additional storage. Administrators quickly add storage
to an existing network simply by attaching a new network attached storage server to the network.
A storage area network (SAN) is a high-speed network with the sole purpose of providing
storage to other servers to which it is attached (Figure 12-23b). A storage area network is a net-
work that includes only storage devices. High-speed fiber-optic cable connects other networks
and servers to the storage area network, so the networks and servers have fast access to large
storage capacities.

Enterprise Storage Systems
Many organizations use networks. Data, information, and instructions stored on the network 
must be easily accessible to all authorized users. The data, information, and instructions also must be
secure, so that unauthorized users cannot access the network. An enterprise storage system is a strat-
egy that focuses on the availability, protection, organization, and backup of storage in a company.
The goal of an enterprise storage system is to consolidate storage so that operations run as effi-
ciently as possible. Most enterprise storage systems manage extraordinary amounts of data. For
example, one large retailer manages a several-hundred TB storage system to store sales data. Read
Ethics & Issues 12-3 for a related discussion.
To implement an enterprise storage system, an organization uses a combination of techniques.
As shown in Figure 12-24, an enterprise storage system may use servers, RAID, a tape library, CD
and DVD jukeboxes, Internet backup, network attached storage devices, and/or a storage area
network. Enterprises often use Fibre Channel technology to connect to storage systems at data
rates up to 4 Gbps.

How Much Data Should Companies Be Required to Keep?
After a string of corporate scandals, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was signed into law in 2002, providing a myriad of financial reporting 
requirements and guidelines for public companies. A main focus of the law is the retention of business records. As provisions of the law
slowly have come into effect, companies have been faced with massive new data storage requirements for these records. For example, all 
e-mail messages within a company are considered to be business records and must be retained. Deleting stored e-mail messages constitutes
a destruction of evidence infraction. Penalties include 20 years in prison for any employee who alters or destroys records or documents. IT
departments are faced not only with understanding this complex law, but also with ensuring accuracy of financial data, determining policies
for record retention, and building storage capacity to hold all of the data. Supporters of the law cite its need due to the recent wave of corpo-
rate scandals. Opponents say that the law is overreaching and costs too much for the added benefits. Is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act an unfair
burden on companies? Why or why not? Should companies be able to engage in internal communications without the fear that those com-
munications could be used as evidence against them later? Why or why not? How should companies go about reacting to the law? Are such
laws necessary in order to protect the public? Why or why not?

Some organizations manage an enterprise storage system in-house. Other enterprises elect
to offload all (or at least the backup) storage management to an outside organization or online
Web service. This practice is known as outsourcing. Some vendors focus on providing enterprise
storage systems to clients. A data warehouse might seek this type of outside service. 
Blade Servers
Blade servers, sometimes called ultradense servers, pack a 
complete computer server, such as a Web server or network server, on
a single card, or blade, rather than a system unit. Each blade server
includes a processor, memory, hard disk, network card, and ports on 
the card. The individual blades insert in a blade server chassis that 
can hold many blades. Using blade servers allows an organization to 
fit 16 or more blades in the physical space occupied by a single server.
Figure 12-25 shows a blade and a chassis that holds many blades.
Besides the savings in space offered by blade servers, blade servers
require less maintenance, use less energy, generate less heat, and 
easily are replaced or upgraded. 
High-Availability Systems
High-availability systems continue running and performing tasks for at least 99 percent of 
the time. Some users demand that high-availability systems be available for 99.99 percent of the
time. A system that has uptime of 99.99 percent is nonfunctional for less than one hour per year.
That one hour, called downtime, includes any time that the computer crashes, needs repairs, or
requires installation of replacement or upgrade parts. A system with 99.9 percent availability is
said to have three nines of availability, and a system with 99.99 percent availability is said to have
four nines of availability.
Telecommunications companies, such as local telephone companies, rely on high-availability
systems to deliver telephone service. Emergency 911 communications centers require almost 100
percent uptime for their hardware and software applications as mandated by law. Centralized
accounting or financial systems must be available to gather sales and other accounting informa-
tion from locations scattered around the globe.
High-availability systems often include a feature called hot-swapping. Hot-swapping allows
components, such as a RAID hard disk or power supplies, to be replaced while the rest of the sys-
tem continues to perform its tasks. A high-availability system also may include redundant com-
ponents. Redundant components, such as redundant power supplies, allow for a functioning
component to take over automatically the tasks of a similar component that fails. When a compo-
nent fails, the system administrator is notified, but the computer continues to perform its tasks
because a redundant component has taken its place automatically in the system.
Scalability
As an enterprise grows, its information systems either must grow with it or must be replaced.
Scalability is a measure of how well a computer hardware system, software application, or infor-
mation system can grow to meet increasing performance demands. A system that is designed,
built, or purchased when the company is small may be inadequate when the company doubles 
in size. When making decisions for computing solutions, managers must be careful to consider
the growth plans of the company.
A company may find that its Web site is becoming overwhelmed by customers and prospective
customers. If the Web site is scalable, then the Web administrator can add more Web servers to
handle the additional visitors to the Web site. Similarly, an enterprise’s storage needs usually
grow daily, meaning that storage systems should be scalable to store the ever-growing data 
generated by users.
Adding more hardware often is the easiest method to grow, or scale, an information system.
Often, at some point, a system no longer scales and must be replaced with a new system.

CHAPTER 12
ENTERPRISE COMPUTING
Utility and Grid Computing
As the need for scalability increases, companies often find that using outside computing
resources is more economical than building new computing capacity internally. Utility and grid
computing are two new technologies that provide flexible and massive online computing power.
Utility computing, or on demand computing, allows companies to use the processing power sit-
ting idle in a network located somewhere else in the world. When the company uses the comput-
ing resources, they pay a fee based on the amount of computing time and other resources that
they consume.
Grid computing combines many servers and/or personal computers on a network, such as the
Internet, to act as one large computer. As with utility computing, a company may pay for the use
of a grid based on the amount of processing time that it needs. Grid computing often is used in
research environments, such as climate research and life science problems. For example, the
SETI@home project uses a grid of millions of personal computers around the world to search
radio signals for signs of extraterrestrial life.
Virtualization
Due to the often dynamic nature of enterprise computing needs, IT administrators often use
virtualization to adapt quickly to the change. Virtualization is the practice of sharing or pooling
computing resources, such as servers and storage devices. Server virtualization provides the
capability to logically divide a physical server into many virtual servers. From the end user’s
point of view, a virtual server behaves just like a physical server. The advantages of server virtu-
alization are that a virtual server can be created and configured quickly, does not require a new
physical server, and is easier to manage. 
Storage virtualization provides the capability to create a single logical storage device from
many physical storage devices. For example, hard disks from many different servers located in
geographically disparate areas can be combined to appear as a single hard disk to the users of the
storage. The advantages of storage virtualization are that the storage can be configured quickly,
may not require the purchase of additional storage devices because the necessary capacity
already may exist, and is easier to manage than traditional storage.
Interoperability
Enterprises typically build and buy a diverse set of information systems. An information system
often must share information, or have interoperability, with other information systems within the
enterprise. Information systems that more easily share information with other information systems
are said to be open. Information systems that are more difficult to interoperate with other infor-
mation systems are said to be closed, or proprietary. Recent open systems employ XML and Web
services to allow a greater level of interoperability.
BACKUP PROCEDURES
Business and home users can perform four types of backup: full, differential, incremental, or
selective. A fifth type, continuous data protection, is used by large enterprises. A full backup,
sometimes called an archival backup, copies all of the files in the computer. A full backup provides
the best protection against data loss because it copies all program and data files. Performing a full
backup can be time-consuming. A differential backup copies only the files that have changed since
the last full backup. An incremental backup copies only the files that have changed since the last
full or last incremental backup. A selective backup, sometimes called a partial backup, allows the
user to choose specific files to back up, regardless of whether or not the files have changed since
the last incremental backup. Continuous data protection (CDP), or continuous backup, is a system
in which all data is backed up whenever a change is made. A continuous data protection plan
keeps a journal of every transaction — reads, writes, and deletes — made to a server or servers.
Whatever backup procedures a company adopts, they should be stated clearly, documented in
writing, and followed consistently.

Disaster Recovery Plan
A disaster recovery plan is a written plan describing the steps a company would take to 
restore computer operations in the event of a disaster. A disaster recovery plan contains four
major components: the emergency plan, the backup plan, the recovery plan, and the test plan.
THE EMERGENCY PLAN
An emergency plan specifies the steps to be taken immediately after a
disaster strikes. All emergency plans should contain the following information:
1. Names and telephone numbers of people and organizations to notify (e.g., management, fire
department, police department)
2. Procedures to follow with the computer equipment (e.g., equipment shutdown, power shutoff,
file removal)
3. Employee evacuation procedures
4. Return procedures; that is, who can reenter the facility and what actions they are to perform
THE BACKUP PLAN
Once the procedures in the emergency plan have been executed, the next
step is to follow the backup plan. The backup plan specifies how an organization uses backup
files and equipment to resume information processing. The backup plan should specify the 
location of an alternate computer facility in the event the an organization’s normal location is
destroyed or unusable. 
When operations are so important that an organization cannot afford to lose the operations to a
disaster, the organization often maintains a hot site, which is a separate facility that mirrors the 
systems and operations of the critical site. The hot site always operates concurrently with the
main site, so that if either site becomes unavailable, the other site continues to meet the organiza-
tion’s needs. The process of one system automatically taking the place of a failed system is 
called failover.
The backup plan identifies these items:
1. The location of backup data, supplies, and equipment
2. The personnel responsible for gathering backup resources and transporting them to the
alternate computer facility
3. A schedule indicating the order in which, and approximate time by which, each application
should be up and running 
For a backup plan to be successful, the organization must back up all critical resources. Also, 
additional people, including possibly nonemployees, must be trained in the backup and 
recovery procedures because the organization’s personnel could be injured in a disaster.
479
BACKUP PROCEDURES 
Should I have a backup plan?
Yes! Even home computers need a backup plan. You probably know someone who lost valuable personal
information due to a hard disk crash or other problem. Most modern operating systems include backup 
software. You should familiarize yourself with the software, develop a plan, and test both backing up and
recovering data. For more information, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch12/faq and then click Backup Software.
THE RECOVERY PLAN
The recovery plan specifies the actions to be taken to restore full information
processing operations. To prepare for disaster recovery, an organization should establish planning
committees, with each one responsible for different forms of recovery. For example, one committee
is in charge of hardware replacement. Another is responsible for software replacement.
THE TEST PLAN
To provide assurance that the disaster plan is complete, it should be tested. A
disaster recovery test plan contains information for simulating various levels of disasters and
recording an organization’s ability to recover. In a simulation, all personnel follow the steps in 
the disaster recovery plan.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter reviewed the special computing requirements present in an enterprise-sized 
organization. Various types of users within an organization require different types of information
systems. Large information systems become more valuable when they communicate with each
other and offer users a great deal of flexibility in interacting with the information system and
other users. The chapter discussed e-retailing and the types of businesses that use e-commerce.
Enterprises manage complex hardware, including storage area networks, RAID, and blade
servers. Requirements for this enterprise hardware often include high-availability, scalability, 
and interoperability which they meet with technologies such as grid and utility computing. The
chapter also discussed the backup procedures present in a large organization. 
CIO
CIO (chief information officer) is the highest-ranking position in an information
technology (IT) department. The CIO manages all of an organizations’s infor-
mation systems and computer resources. In large organizations, the CIO typi-
cally is a vice president and reports directly to the organization’s CEO.
Depending on the organization, a CIO can be called an MIS (management 
information systems) manager, an IS (information systems) manager, or an IT
(information technology) manager. Regardless of the title, the CIO determines an organization’s information
needs and provides the systems to meet those needs. The CIO sets an IT department’s goals, policies, and
procedures. In addition, the CIO evaluates technology, hires and supervises staff, oversees the network,
directs user services, develops backup and disaster recovery plans, and manages the department budget.
Perhaps most important, the CIO provides leadership, creating a vision for an IT department and helping 
the department deliver that vision.
Some CIOs work as consultants, providing corporate IT departments with short-term or long-term 
guidance. Most CIOs rise through the ranks of an organization’s IT department. Generally, CIOs have a
bachelor’s degree or higher in computer science and at least ten years’ experience in an IT department.
Today, many CIOs also have an MBA. Pay reflects the importance of the CIO, with salaries ranging from
$150,000 for smaller companies to $350,000 for large companies. For more information, visit scsite.com/

John Chambers
Cisco Chairman and CEO
Investors and employees give John Chambers standing ovations at business meetings for his enthusiasm, excellent listening
skills, and quick decisions. But the Cisco chairman and CEO did not always enjoy such sweet success. As a youth, he struggled
from dyslexia. During the dotcom crash of 2001, Cisco’s growth dropped from 70 percent to negative 30 percent in 45 days as
inventories rose. But Chambers overcame these obstacles and has turned his life and his company into success stories.
He is active in philanthropic activities worldwide and has received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship from the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution and the Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy
Award from the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy, an international forum of CEOs focused on corporate philanthropy.
Chambers earned a law degree from West Virginia University and an MBA degree from Indiana University. He worked at IBM
and Wang Laboratories for 14 years before joining Cisco in 1991 as head of sales and operations. For more information, visit

Jim Clark
Technology Innovator
When Jim Clark has an idea, people listen. As a professor at Stanford University, he developed a computer chip that processed
3-D images in real time. The high-powered chip formed the basis of Clark’s first company, Silicon Graphics, and was used to
create everything from suspension bridges to scenes in Hollywood movies.
Seeking more innovation opportunities, Clark contacted Marc Andreessen, creator of the Web browser, Mosaic. Together, they
launched Netscape Communications Corporation, the source of one of the world’s more successful Web browsers, Netscape
Navigator.
Since then, Clark has started other computer-related companies: Healtheon, which links doctors, patients, and health insurance
providers; MyCFO, a Web-based financial advisory firm; and Shutterfly, an online digital photo printing service. For more information,

The Chapter Review section summarizes the concepts presented in this chapter. To obtain help from other students regarding
any subject in this chapter, visit scsite.com/dcf5e/ch12/forum and post your thoughts or questions.
What Are the Special Information Requirements of an Enterprise-Sized Corporation?
A large organization, or enterprise, requires special computing solutions because of its size and geographical extent.
Enterprise computing uses computers in networks or a series of interconnected networks to satisfy the information 
needs of an enterprise. The types of information employees require depend on their level in the company. Managers
utilize tools and techniques such as business intelligence, business process management, and business process 
automation to focus on information that is important to the decision-making process.
What Information Systems Are Used in the Functional Units of an Enterprise?
An information system is a set of hardware, software, data, people, and procedures that work together to produce 
information. In an enterprise, each type of functional unit has specialized requirements for their information systems.
Accounting and financial systems manage everyday transactions and help budget, forecast, and analyze. A human
resources information system (HRIS) manages one or more human resources functions. Engineers use computer-aided
design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE). Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and computer-integrated
manufacturing (CIM) speed manufacturing. A marketing information system serves as a central repository for marketing
tasks. Sales force automation (SFA) software equips salespeople with the tools they need. Distribution systems control
inventory and manage shipping. Customer interaction management (CIM) software manages interactions with customers.
The information technology (IT) department makes technology decisions for an enterprise.
What Information Systems Are Used throughout an Enterprise?
Some general purpose information systems, or enterprise-wide systems, are used throughout an enterprise. A transaction
processing system (TPS) captures and processes data from day-to-day business activities. A management information
system (MIS) generates accurate, timely, and organized information, so users can make decisions, solve problems, and
track progress. A decision support system (DSS) helps users analyze data and make decisions. Enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) provides applications to help manage and coordinate ongoing activities. Customer relationship
management (CRM) systems manage information about customers. A content management system (CMS) organizes 
and allows access to various forms of documents and files.
What Are Types of Technologies Used throughout an Enterprise?
Technologies used throughout an enterprise include portals, electronic data interchange, data warehouses, extranets, Web
services, workflow, and virtual private networks. A portal is a collection of links, content, and services on a Web page
designed to guide users to information related to their jobs. EDI (electronic data interchange) controls the transfer of data
and information among computers. A data warehouse stores and manages the data required to analyze transactions. An
extranet allows customers or suppliers to access part of an enterprise’s intranet. Web services allow businesses to create
products and B2B interactions. A workflow application assists in the management and tracking of the activities in a busi-
ness process. A virtual private network (VPN) provides users with a secure connection to a company’s network server.
What Are the Major Types of E-Commerce?
E-retail occurs when retailers use the Web to sell their products or services. Online banking allows users to pay bills from
their computers or personal mobile devices, and online trading lets users invest without using a broker. Entertainment and
media on the Web include music, videos, news, sporting events, and 3-D multiplayer games. Travel-related services on the
Web include directions; airline, hotel, or car reservations; and a shopping bot that searches for the best price on a product
or service.

What Are the Computer Hardware Needs and Solutions for an Enterprise?
Enterprise hardware allows large organizations to manage and share information and data using devices geared for 
maximum availability and efficiency. A RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is a group of integrated disks that
duplicates data, instructions, and information to improve data reliability. Network attached storage (NAS) is a server 
that provides storage for users and information systems. A storage area network (SAN) provides storage to other servers. 
An enterprise storage system consolidates storage so that operations run efficiently. Blade servers pack a complete com-
puter server on a single card. High-availability systems continue running and performing tasks for at least 99 percent of
the time. Utility computing allows companies to use the processing power sitting idle in a network located elsewhere.
Grid computing combines many servers and/or personal computers to act as one large computer.
Why Is Computer Backup Important, and How Is It Accomplished?
A backup duplicates a file or program to protect an enterprise if the original is lost or damaged. A full backup copies all of
the files in a computer. A differential backup copies only files that have changed since the last full backup. An incremental
backup copies only files that have changed since the last full or incremental backup. A selective backup allows users to
back up specific files. With continuous data protection (CDP), all data is backed up whenever a change is made.
What Are the Steps in a Disaster Recovery Plan?
A disaster recovery plan describes the steps a company would take to restore computer operations in the event of a
disaster. A disaster recovery plan contains four components. The emergency plan specifies the steps to be taken immedi-
ately after a disaster strikes. The backup plan stipulates how a company uses backup files and equipment to resume infor-
mation processing. The recovery plan identifies the actions to be taken to restore full information processing operations.
The test plan contains information for simulating disasters and recording an organization’s ability to recover.

LEARN HOW TO 1: Use VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)
Every enterprise organization depends on reliable communications. An important means of communication is voice, 
or telephone, communications. In most organizations today, a telephone company is the primary vendor for providing
telephone communications. In the near future, however, the Internet might be the largest provider of telephone 
communications.
You learned in a previous chapter about VoIP, which provides for voice communications using the Internet instead of
standard telephone connections. Two advantages claimed for VoIP are improved reliability and much lower costs. Both of
these advantages are attractive to businesses, and VoIP is forecasted to become the standard voice communications method
within the next 5 – 10 years.
VoIP also is available to individual users. One primary means to use VoIP is through the service offered by Skype, a
company that offers free, unlimited calls through an Internet connection. The Skype software also is free. Using Skype,
you can talk to another Skype user via the Internet anywhere in the world for no cost whatsoever. If the person you 
call is not a Skype user, you can use Skype to call their ordinary landline or mobile telephone quite inexpensively. For
example, to call someone on a landline telephone in the United Kingdom from anywhere in the world, the cost is 
approximately 2 cents per minute.
The following quote indicates the potential future of VoIP and services like Skype:
“I knew it was over when I downloaded Skype,” Michael Powell, chairman of the Federal Communications 
Commission, explained. “When the inventors of KaZaA are distributing for free a little program that you can 
use to talk to anybody else, and the quality is fantastic, and it’s free — it’s over. The world will change now inevitably.”
Fortune Magazine, February 16, 2004
To download Skype, complete the following steps:
1. Start your Internet browser, type www.skype.com in the
Address bar, and then press the ENTER key.
2. When the Skype home page is displayed, explore the Web site
for information about using Skype. When you are ready, click
the Download Skype link.
3. When the File Download — Security Warning dialog box is
displayed, click the Save button.
4. In the Save As dialog box, select the Desktop for the location of
the saved file. Then, click the Save button. The Skype Setup file
will download. This may take a few minutes, depending on the
speed of your Internet connection, because of the large file size.
5. When the Download complete window is displayed, click the
Close button. The SkypeSetup icon is displayed on the desktop.
6. Double-click the SkypeSetup icon on the desktop. If any
warning dialog boxes appear, click the Run button. If the User
Account Control dialog box appears, click the Continue button.
7. In the Skype Install window, select the language you would like
to use, click the check box to agree to the Skype End User
License Agreement and the Skype Privacy Statement, and then
click the Install button.
8. Remove the check mark from the check box prompting you to
install the free Google Toolbar, and then click the Next button.
9. When the installation is completed, click the Finish button.
