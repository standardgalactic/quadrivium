●
Frozensets are immutable sets; They have the same properties and behaviour as sets 
except they cannot be mutated or modified;
●
Frozensets can be used as keys in dictionaries or as elements in another set or frozenset;
●
To create a frozenset we use the frozenset() function;
 
 
>>> fs1 = frozenset()
>>> fs2 = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 3, 6])
>>> fs2
frozenset({1, 2, 3, 6})
●
All methods and operations that don’t modify the set are also available to frozensets. 
These operations can be performed on mixed sets and frozensets and the result will have 
the type of the first operand;
