About the Authors
Brent Agin, MD: Dr. Agin was born and raised in Michigan, where he devel-
oped an appreciation for athletics and exercise at a young age. In 1989, he 
went off to Michigan State University, competing for four years on the MSU 
soccer team and earning Academic All-Big Ten honors during his junior year. 
He decided to pursue a career in medicine and attended Michigan State 
University College of Human Medicine, graduating in 1999. He headed south 
to fi nish his medical career, completing residency training in Family Medicine 
at the University of South Florida in 2002.
Dr. Agin’s lifelong interest in sports expanded into the fi elds of health and 
nutrition. Once he entered into private practice, he implemented a practice 
model that allowed him to focus not only on medical care, but also on the use 
of diet and nutrition to improve health.
Dr. Agin co-authored the book Healthy Aging For Dummies (Wiley) while 
continuing to expand his diet and nutritional supplement line called Trim 
(www.trimlifestyle.com). He now practices wellness medicine and helps 
patients understand the powerful impact they have on their health and aging.
Shereen Jegtvig: Shereen Jegtvig began her fi rst career as a chiropractor 
in 1990. She practiced in western Wisconsin, where she saw the effects of 
healthful (and not so healthful) diets on her patients every day. In order to 
offer the best care to her patients, she knew she needed to learn more about 
which foods could do the most to improve human health. Thus, her fascina-
tion with superfoods was born.
Armed with nutrition books (and eventually a new computer with dial-up 
Internet access), Shereen spent countless hours researching and learn-
ing about superfoods. The advent of broadband cable Internet access led 
her to more effi cient online searches, a mild Internet addiction, and, most 
importantly, the opportunity to write about nutrition for the large Web site 
About.com in 2004.
Shereen enjoyed her newfound ability to reach a large audience that just 
couldn’t be duplicated in a clinical setting, so she began her second career 
as a health and nutrition writer. She returned to college and earned a master 
of science degree in human nutrition with special interest in the effects 
of omega-3 fats on cognitive function. Today, at nutrition.about.com, she 
focuses on teaching readers why they need to eat superfoods as well as pre-
senting helpful dietary tips and how-to’s. Shereen knows that a pomegranate 
or a carton of blueberries won’t help anyone’s health if they never leave the 
refrigerator.


Dedication
Brent dedicates this book to his parents and siblings who pushed him both in 
athletics and academics and provided the guidance to live healthy. A special 
thanks to his wife Cindy and their two daughters, Emma and Grace, who have 
supported the long hours dedicated to his overwhelming number of projects. 
He can’t forget his offi ce staff — Ina, Kathy, and Zoe — for their dedication 
and hard work. Thanks to Shereen Jegtvig, whose extensive knowledge in 
nutrition and excellent writing style made writing this book a pleasure.
Shereen dedicates this book to Jim Lehman, who loves her, motivates her, 
and puts up with her endless hours of Internet research and writing, and 
to her children Kendyl and John Reis, who fi ll her life with happiness and 
wonder (and a lot of dirty dishes). And special thanks to her parents, Virgil 
and Becky Jegtvig.

Superfoods For Dummies

Introduction
T
he power of the foods you eat to help you or hurt you is quite amazing. 
We’ve both seen the health of patients improve dramatically when they 
break their junk-food habits and turn to healthful foods instead. And we know 
that when patients understand the importance of nutrition, they’re more 
likely to support a healthful diet.
We want to help you feel healthier too, so we wrote Superfoods For Dummies 
to show you which foods give you the most bang for your dietary buck — 
our superfoods. We think these foods are extra-special because they can 
improve your health and prevent disease, and we have the science to back 
these claims up. Most of our superfoods are easy to find, and you’ll be quite 
comfortable with them. But we also introduce you to some lesser-known 
superfoods.
So what’s in it for you? Maybe you want to be more energetic, lose weight, 
reduce your cholesterol, or lower your blood pressure. No matter what your 
reason for being interested in superfoods, we know that once you feel the 
benefits, you’ll want to keep these superfoods in your diet for a lifetime — 
a very long and healthful lifetime.
About This Book
If we tried to write down everything there is to know about food, nutrition, 
diet, and health in this one book, you’d have to add a new room onto your 
home just to store it because such a book would be enormous. So, in the 
interest of practicality, we give you a quick overview of nutrition, then jump 
right into the superfoods. We do much more than just give you a list of 
healthful foods, though. We explain how you can benefit from adding super-
foods to your diet and give you tips and how-to’s for buying your superfoods. 
Then we tell you how to prepare them so they’ll continue to be super — no 
unhealthy cooking methods here — and how to serve them so they’ll be 
absolutely delicious.

Superfoods For Dummies 
Here are a few of the points that we explore:
 
✓ Why you and your family need superfoods: The rationale for eating them
 
✓ What makes each superfood so super: The science behind the food
 
✓ Where you can find superfoods: Grocery stores, specialty shops, and 
online sources
 
✓ How to prepare and enjoy superfoods: Cooking instructions and easy-
to-prepare superfood recipes
With Superfoods For Dummies, you can start at the beginning of the book or 
pick any chapter from the table of contents and dig in. Every chapter is writ-
ten to stand on its own, and we’ve included lots of examples and tips so you 
can start eating more superfoods right away.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things con-
sistent and easy to understand:
 
✓ We use monofont for Web sites. Note: When this book was printed, 
some Web addresses may have needed to break across two lines of text. 
If that happened, rest assured that we haven’t put in any extra char-
acters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using one of 
these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, as 
though the line break doesn’t exist.
 
✓ New words or terms are in italics, and they’re closely followed by an 
easy-to-understand definition.
 
✓ Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps and key 
words and phrases in bulleted lists.
 
✓ When we discuss scientific research, we give you the source of that 
research; titles of medical and scientific journals are in italics.
What You’re Not to Read
We’ve written this book so you can find the information you need easily and 
quickly. All the chapters provide you with important information, but some 
sections offer greater detail or tidbits of information that you can skip if you 
like. We encourage you to read this information along with the regular text, 
but if you want to focus on the main points of the chapters, you can always 
come back to these sections another time.

3
 Introduction
You can skip the following items without feeling guilty:
 
✓ Sidebars: Sidebars are shaded boxes that give detailed examples or 
explore a tangent in more detail. Ignoring these won’t compromise your 
understanding of the rest of the material.
 
✓ The stuff on the copyright page: No kidding. You’ll find nothing here 
of interest unless you’re inexplicably enamored of legal language and 
Library of Congress numbers.
Foolish Assumptions
This book is for anyone interested in exploring foods that not only taste 
great but have the potential to make you feel better and live longer — which 
should be you! In writing this book, we assume that you, the reader, fall into 
one or more of the following categories:
 
✓ You’re a parent looking for some guidance on nutrition and the right 
foods to create a balanced diet for healthy kids.
 
✓ You’re a personal trainer, health instructor, or otherwise involved in 
healthy living, and you want to expand your knowledge of how you can 
help your clients improve their diets.
 
✓ You have medical conditions that may improve by eating superfoods.
 
✓ You’re over your ideal weight and want to find out how eating super-
foods can help you lose weight.
 
✓ You’re underweight and you’re searching for healthful ways to add calo-
ries without eating junk foods.
 
✓ You already eat right, but you’re looking for some new foods that can 
add more vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to your diet.
 
✓ You’re a chef or a restaurant owner who wants easy ways to add super-
foods to your recipes to make your dishes even healthier.
 
✓ You’re willing to make dietary changes and stick with them until eating 
healthful foods becomes a good habit.
How This Book Is Organized
Superfoods For Dummies is divided into five parts that are packed with impor-
tant information to make you superfood-savvy in no time. We organized these 
parts so you can easily navigate through the book to find whatever topic 
you’re looking for. Here’s a quick look at what each part covers.

4
Superfoods For Dummies 
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods
Part I is a primer on nutrition and superfoods. We start with the basics of 
good nutrition and then explain why you need superfoods. Superfoods can 
help you feel better now and reduce your risk for diseases — like heart dis-
ease, cancer, and diabetes — later. Part I also discusses the role of dietary 
supplements in a superfoods diet.
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: 
A Look at the Superfoods
Part II provides the nuts and bolts of the superfood machinery that can help 
you live a healthier life. The chapters in this part look closely at the foods 
that made it onto our superfoods list. We tell you why these foods are super 
and describe the research and science behind them. We also give you tips for 
finding, storing, and preparing them.
Part III: Launching Your 
Superfoods Lifestyle
This is where the saying, “Actions speak louder than words,” becomes very 
important. In Part III, you discover how to take action and get superfoods into 
your lifestyle. We show you how to incorporate superfoods into your diet 
both at home and when you’re eating out. We give you tips on getting your 
family to hop on the superfoods bandwagon and offer advice on shopping for 
superfoods. We even include a chapter on growing your own superfoods.
Part IV: Putting Superfoods on Your Table
This part is all about the eating. We show you the best ways to prepare 
superfoods (you’ll be amazed at how quickly you can become a superfoods 
chef). From breakfast to dinner, we share great superfood recipes for every 
meal. We even include snacks, side dishes, and desserts. With these easy 
recipes, there’s really no excuse for not adding superfoods to your culinary 
regimen.

 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is designed to present lots of information in quick, easy-to-
read segments. We offer four “top ten” lists in this part, starting with the best 
of the best, or the super-duper superfoods. We also give you our top super-
food supplements and ten (or so) tips for getting those superfoods into your 
diet. Last but not least, we include a list of our top ten almost-superfoods — 
foods that don’t quite make the super cut, but that are good for you and 
won’t blow your diet.
Icons Used in This Book
This book uses icons — small graphics in the margins — to help you quickly 
recognize especially important information in the text. Here are the icons we 
use and what they mean:
 
This icon appears whenever an idea or item can save you time, money, or stress 
as you add superfoods to your diet. These include cooking and shopping tips, 
plus ideas for incorporating superfoods into some of your favorite dishes.

structure makes it very easy to start with the topics that interest you the 
most.
If you already know a lot about superfoods, turn to Chapters 16–19 for some 
great superfood recipes. If you’re curious about what superfoods can do for 
your overall health and sense of well-being, start with Chapter 2. If you’re 
a gardener, check out Chapter 14 for tips on starting your own superfoods 
garden.
Chapters 4–10 let you familiarize yourself with specific superfoods and 
their particular benefits. Or you can get tips and ideas for incorporating 
superfoods into your life by reading Chapter 11. No matter where you go in 
Superfoods For Dummies, you’re sure to discover a lot and gain a healthy atti-
tude toward eating right!

efore you get started on your superfoods diet, it’s 
helpful to understand why superfoods are so good 
for you. In this part, we start with a primer on nutrition 
and how your body uses the foods you eat, and we show 
you the differences between regular foods and super-
foods. We also explain how superfoods can improve your 
own health and your family’s health.
Finally, we discuss dietary supplements and what they 
can — and can’t — do for you. Supplements are often 
touted as shortcuts to good nutrition, but they don’t 
always live up to expectations. We show you what to look 
for and how to use supplements properly.

efore we get started on the superfoods, it’s important to understand 
what a superfood is as well as the basics of good nutrition and a sound 
diet. The superfoods all have super health benefits; however, they’ll have a 
bigger impact if you improve the rest of your diet as well.
In this chapter, we introduce you to superfoods and give you the basics of 
good nutrition. We help you figure out how many calories you need every day, 
and we show you examples of how superfoods fit into a well-balanced diet.
Understanding the Difference between 
Foods and Superfoods
What are superfoods? Your body requires food for essential nutrients and 
energy. But some foods are better than others. Some foods are bad for your 
health, and eating them can raise your risk of certain diseases. In contrast, 
some foods are good for you because they give you the energy you need and 
a few nutrients. At the top of the heap are superfoods, which are rich in nutri-
ents and natural substances that have been shown by research studies to 
improve your health and reduce your risk for disease.
Disease is an impairment of health by a condition of the body or mind that 
causes dysfunction. Health is a condition of well-being free from disease. Eating 
foods that have poor nutritional value leads to malnutrition, which can cause 

10
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
dysfunction of the body and therefore is a form of disease. You need to eat 
foods that have the correct nutrients to help keep yourself in good health.
Superfoods have been shown to be especially good for you because they’re rich 
in vitamins and minerals, plus they have extra compounds that have a positive 
impact on your health. These compounds may include good fats like omega-3 
fatty acids and monounsaturated fats, a variety of phytochemicals (natural 
chemicals found in plants), and dietary fiber. All our recommended superfoods 
have been involved in scientific studies that back up the health claims.
 
Adding a few superfoods to your diet can improve your health by keeping 
your heart healthy, boosting your immune system, making it easier to lose 
weight, fending off diabetes, preventing some cancers, and much more. Eating 
a superfoods-rich diet also allows you to age gracefully and beautifully.
Boning Up on Basic Nutrition
The foods you eat supply your body with the energy you need to get through 
the day, along with the raw materials to keep all your organ systems running 
smoothly. Eating a diet with the right amounts of nutrients accomplishes just 
that, and superfoods do it in spades.
When you eat a diet with too many calories and unhealthful foods, you’re at 
great risk of becoming obese. Not only do bad foods fail to give you all the 
nutrients you need, but they also damage your body. While the occasional 
candy bar or bacon cheeseburger with fries probably won’t hurt you, making 
a daily habit of eating these kinds of foods will. Superfoods contain lots of 
nutrients, so eating superfoods makes it easy to get the nutrients you need 
without unwanted calories and unhealthy ingredients.
Picking out foods is easier when you understand what nutrients are and what 
they do for your body. Nutrients are the substances in food that your body 
uses for energy and to build tissues. There are big nutrients, small nutrients, 
and special nutrients called phytochemicals. The following sections tell you 
what you need to know about each type.
Introducing the big nutrients you 
need: Carbs, proteins, and fats
Macronutrients is the technical term for the big nutrients: carbohydrates, protein, 
and fats. You need to eat foods that contain all three of the macronutrients in 
a healthful balance every day. Eating superfoods helps you maintain this bal-
ance because superfoods contain healthy ratios of these macronutrients and 
high amounts of the healthiest nutrients.

 Chapter 1: Nourishing Your Body with Superfoods
Coping with carbohydrates
Carbohydrates include simple sugars and complex carbohydrates (starches), 
and we put fiber in this category, too. Dietary carbohydrates are found in 
foods that come from plant sources. Your body uses carbohydrates as fuel, 
so a large part of your diet should be made up of carbohydrates. In fact, 
about half of your daily calories should come from carbohydrates — but 
some are better than others.
All carbohydrates are made up of some combination of three simple sugars 
officially known as monosaccharides (single sugar units). These three sugars 
are galactose (milk sugar), fructose (fruit sugar), and glucose (the type of 
sugar your body uses as fuel).
Sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (milk sugar) are other types of simple 
sugars called disaccharides (two-sugar units). Lactose is made up of glucose 
and galactose and is formed in the mammary glands in breast tissue. Sucrose 
is made up of glucose and fructose. It doesn’t matter whether the sugar is 
white, brown, or raw (turbinado); they’re all the same. Sucrose molecules are 
broken down and digested very quickly. Your body either uses the resultant 
fructose and glucose molecules as energy or converts them to fat and stores 
them on your body, usually on your belly, butt, or thighs.
Starch (a complex carbohydrate) is made up of long chains of glucose mol-
ecules. Starch isn’t broken down as quickly as sucrose, but it’s still metabo-
lized efficiently. And, just like simple sugars, extra starch is converted to fat.
Fiber is plant material that you can’t digest, but it’s very important for 
good health. Insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve in water; instead, it absorbs it. 
Insoluble fiber remains in solid form, adding bulk to your stool, which helps 
the muscles of the colon move stool through the digestive system. Soluble 
Low fat versus low carb: Which is best?
Low-fat diets became popular in the 1980s. 
They emphasized cutting back on unhealthy, 
high-calorie, fatty foods, thereby helping people 
to lose weight. Unfortunately, food manufactur-
ers began making low-fat and non-fat foods 
that were still high in calories. Of course, these 
products became very popular and people 
stopped losing weight.
In the 1990s, low-carb diets became all the 
rage, and, again, people lost weight when they 
cut high-calorie sugary foods out of their diets. 
Then low-carb, sugar-free foods arrived, but 
they, too, were high in calories, so Americans 
continued to gain weight.
So which is best? We think the answer lies in 
the middle, with a balanced diet and the right 
amount of calories. That means reducing the 
amount of bad fats (like the low-fat diets), 
but keeping the good fats. It also means dump-
ing the sugar (like the low-carb diets), but 
keeping whole grains and healthful fruits and 
vegetables.

12
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
fiber dissolves in water, forming a protective gel that also adds bulk (and 
works as a natural stool-softener) and has other important health benefits 
such as lowering cholesterol.
So which carbohydrates are good and which ones are bad? The refined 
carbohydrates that aren’t accompanied by any (or only very little) fiber are 
usually bad, with table sugar and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) being the 
worst. They’re highly refined, so they add a lot of sweetness but don’t pro-
vide any nutrition other than calories. Diets high in sucrose and HFCS lead to 
obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.
Refined flour is just a step or two above refined sugar. Refined flour has had 
most of the fibrous parts (along with a good bit of the nutrition) removed. 
Most flour is enriched, however, which adds several vitamins back. Foods 
like regular pasta, white bread, and crackers are made from refined flour. 
Choose whole-grain (unrefined) products whenever possible to increase 
the amount of fiber in your diet because, unlike refined grains, whole grains 
retain the parts of the plant that contain the healthy fiber content.
 
Good carbohydrates are usually accompanied by a good dose of fiber. Besides 
whole grains, good carbohydrates are found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, 
nuts, and seeds, many of which have attained superfood status. Fiber slows 
down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, which helps to regulate 
your blood sugar level (which is good for energy and for preventing diabetes) 
and keeps you feeling full. The best part is that fiber has zero calories.
 
Fruit juices are high in natural sugars and low in fiber (unless you leave in the 
pulp), but they’re also rich in vitamins and minerals, so they’re good carbohy-
drates. One bit of caution if you’re watching your weight: The natural sugars 
in fruit juice are absorbed quickly and can be high in calories. Eat whole fresh 
fruits whenever you can.
The best carbohydrates are found in most of our superfoods. They are unre-
fined carbohydrates accompanied by nutrients and phytochemicals (see the 
upcoming section “Zeroing in on superfoods nutrients: Phytochemicals”), 
and/or are high in fiber.
Pondering proteins
Proteins are chains of little chemical building blocks called amino acids. After 
you eat protein, the chains are broken down into individual amino acids, 
which are absorbed into your blood. Your body takes the amino acids, builds 
new proteins out of them, and uses them as the raw material to maintain and 
repair almost every part of your body.
All animal products contain protein, including meats, fish, poultry, eggs, and 
dairy products. The proteins in animal products are called complete proteins 
because they contain all the essential amino acids (amino acids that need to 
come from the diet because your body can’t make them on its own). Plant 

13
 Chapter 1: Nourishing Your Body with Superfoods
foods contain proteins, too — especially nuts, seeds, and legumes — but 
most plants are missing one or more of the essential amino acids and thus 
are called incomplete proteins. This is important for vegetarians and vegans 
to know so they can find the right combination of foods to get all the amino 
acids. Fortunately, some food plants, like soy, are complete proteins, and, if 
you eat a variety of plant foods — grains, nuts, seeds, and veggies — every 
day, you can get all the amino acids you need.
Apart from being complete or incomplete, there isn’t much difference in the 
proteins you eat. What makes proteins good or bad is the type of fat that accom-
panies them. For example, red meat with lots of saturated fat isn’t a good source 
of protein and should be limited. Lean meats are better, and fish that are rich in 
healthy fats (see Chapter 7) are the best. Plant proteins are always a healthful 
choice because they’re accompanied by good fats and fiber.
 
Cooking methods can make a difference, too. A piece of baked fish is good for 
you, but deep-fat fried fish is not.
You don’t need large amounts of protein. In fact, only about 15 to 20 percent 
of your calories should come from protein. Our superfood proteins include 
legumes and whole grains (see Chapter 8) and nuts and seeds (see Chapter 6).
What’s the fuss about fats?
The fats and oils in the foods you eat are made up of individual molecules 
called fatty acids. Your body needs some fats; in fact, they should comprise 
about 30 percent of the calories you take in daily. Fats are important for 
lubrication of body surfaces, formation of hormones, energy storage, and 
insulation from cold. Limited amounts of fat help protect internal organs, and 
fats also carry the fat-soluble vitamins that are necessary components of the 
membranes that surround all the cells in your body.
But not all fats are created equal. Some are very good for you, whereas 
others are bad for your health:
 
✓ Saturated fats: These fats are found mostly in animal products like red 
fatty meats, eggs, and dairy products. They’re solid at room temperature. 
Coconut and other tropical oils also contain large amounts of saturated 
fat. Eating saturated fats causes your level of cholesterol (a type of blood 
fat) to go up and promotes inflammation. Diets rich in saturated fats are 
associated with both an increased risk of heart disease and an increased 
risk of some cancers. Our superfoods are all low in saturated fats.
 
 Keep your consumption of high-fat red meats to only two or three meals 
per week. Choose more fish, lean poultry, legumes, nuts, and seeds.
 
✓ Trans-fats: Most trans-fats are created by forcing hydrogen into vegeta-
ble oils to make them more solid. Some stick margarines, for example, 
undergo this process. (Dairy products have a natural trans-fat, but it 
doesn’t seem to be as harmful as the artificial kind.) The process, called 

14
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
partial hydrogenation, alters the structure of the fatty acids to look more 
like saturated fats. Unfortunately, trans-fats are worse for your health 
than saturated fats, and you should avoid them whenever possible. 
Trans-fats are most commonly found in processed snack foods, oils that 
are used for deep frying, and pastries, as well as some brands of marga-
rine. The superfoods don’t have any trans-fats.
 
 Read the labels on packaged foods to be sure they don’t contain any 
trans-fats.
 
✓ Monounsaturated fats: These fatty acids are found in abundance in 
some plants. Olive oil is the best known example, but canola oil, pea-
nuts, and avocados also contain some monounsaturated fatty acids. 
Monounsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are good for 
you. Eating monounsaturated fats in place of saturated fats has been 
shown to reduce the risk of heart disease. Monounsaturated fats lower 
your cholesterol, reduce inflammation, keep your blood vessels healthy, 
and may reduce your risk of some cancers. Many of the superfoods con-
tain large amounts of monounsaturated fats.
 
✓ Choose monounsaturated fats often — every day if possible. Use olive 
oil for cooking and as a salad dressing.
 
✓ Polyunsaturated fats: These fats are liquid at room temperature and are 
abundant in plant oils and fish. There are two types of polyunsaturated 
fats: omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish, flax seeds, and chia seeds) and 
omega-6 fatty acids (found in most vegetable and seed oils). Both of 
these fatty acids are important for good health. They’re called essential 
fatty acids because you have to get them from your diet — your body 
can’t manufacture them from other fats.
 
 There’s one problem with polyunsaturated fats, though. Most people get 
plenty of the omega-6 fatty acids in their diet; in fact, most people get too 
many because vegetable oils are common in many foods. The opposite is 
true for the omega-3 fatty acids — most people are deficient. Eating too 
many of the omega-6s and too few of the omega-3s leads to an imbalance 
that promotes inflammation in the body. Eating the right amount, about 
a 4 to 1 ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s, helps to reduce inflammation and 
improve your health. The typical ratio in the Western diet is 15 or 16 to 1.
 
 Many of our superfoods are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, especially our 
fish (see Chapter 7), flax and pumpkin seeds (see Chapter 6), and chia 
seeds (see Chapter 10).
Getting to know the little nutrients 
you need: Vitamins and minerals
Micronutrients (the little nutrients) include vitamins and minerals. You don’t 
need large amounts of these nutrients compared to the macronutrients, but 

15
 Chapter 1: Nourishing Your Body with Superfoods
you do need small amounts on a regular basis to keep your body working at 
its best. Most of the superfoods are rich in some of the micronutrients, but 
none are rich in all of them — that’s why you need a balanced diet.
When you eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, 
legumes, fish, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products, you get the vitamins 
you need every day. When you make sure some of those foods are super-
foods, you get even more nutrition plus all the powerful fats, fiber, and phy-
tochemicals that keep you feeling young and healthy.
Becoming versed in water-soluble vitamins
Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water and aren’t as easily stored by the 
body as fat-soluble vitamins. The foods you eat must supply the eight B 
complex vitamins and vitamin C every day because your body consistently 
eliminates them (except for vitamin B12). Water-soluble vitamins also are 
more fragile and can be destroyed during cooking. By eating a healthful 
superfoods-rich diet, you’re able to get plenty of these vitamins.
The B complex vitamins include thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), 
pantothenic acid, pyridoxine (B6), folate, cobalamin (B12), and biotin. The 
B vitamins are found in a wide variety of foods (except for B12, which is only 
found in animal products). B vitamins help you convert the macronutrients 
from the foods you eat into energy, plus they’re necessary for many other 
normal body functions.
Vitamin C is found in fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits, strawber-
ries, and peppers. Vitamin C is needed for normal immune system function, 
speedy wound healing, and strong connective tissue.
Finding the fat-soluble vitamins
Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in fatty tissues and your liver, so you won’t 
become deficient in these vitamins as quickly as with the water-soluble vita-
mins. Vitamin A is needed for normal vision and cell growth and is found in 
both plant-based foods and animal products. Vitamin E is found in nuts and 
seeds and works as an antioxidant to protect the cells in your body from free-
radical damage. Vitamin K is found in leafy green vegetables and is essential 
for normal blood clotting.
A healthful, balanced diet provides just the right amounts of these vitamins, 
except for vitamin D, which is made by your body after your skin is exposed 
to sunlight. You need about 5 to 20 minutes of sun exposure to your face, 
arms, or legs twice each week to form a sufficient amount of vitamin D. Some 
foods (like milk) are fortified with extra vitamin D, or you can always get vita-
min D through supplements. The American Academy of Dermatology recom-
mends utilizing fortified foods and supplements for vitamin D rather than sun 
exposure because of the risk of skin cancer.

Minding the major minerals
Major minerals include calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, chlorine, potassium, 
sodium, and sulfur. They’re called major because you need to replenish them 
with amounts greater than 0.01 percent of your body weight every day. Major 
minerals are found in a variety of foods. A healthful diet contains all the miner-
als you need, although calcium is commonly taken as a dietary supplement.
Calcium is important for many processes in your body and is especially 
important for strong bones, muscle function, and normal blood clotting. 
Magnesium and phosphorus are also important for bone health, and mag-
nesium is present in your muscles, too. Potassium, chloride, and sodium 
are called electrolytes: They work to keep your body fluids in balance, which 
affects your blood pressure. Sulfur is used in making some proteins.
 
Many of the superfoods are rich in calcium, magnesium, and potassium, while 
remaining low in sodium. Although sodium is necessary for good health, most 
people consume way too much of it, which can lead to high blood pressure.
Tackling the trace minerals
Trace minerals include iron, iodine, cobalt, copper, fluoride, manganese, 
molybdenum, selenium, vanadium, and zinc. You don’t need quite as much 
of the trace minerals as you do the major minerals; however, they’re just as 
important for maintaining a healthy body.
Iron, copper, and cobalt are necessary for normal red blood cell production; 
iodine helps your thyroid; fluoride is good for your teeth; molybdenum, vana-
dium, and zinc are cofactors in many chemical reactions; and selenium is an 
antioxidant.
 
Our superfoods provide varying amounts of the trace minerals, especially 
iron, selenium, manganese, and zinc.
Zeroing in on superfoods nutrients: 
Phytochemicals
Phytochemicals are plant chemicals that offer a variety of health benefits, and 
all our plant-based superfoods are rich in phytochemicals. There are several 
different types of phytochemicals (we go into details for each superfood in 
Chapters 4–6 and 8–10). Here’s a basic rundown:
 
✓ Polyphenols are a family of related phytochemicals that includes biofla-
vonoids, tannins, and lignans.
 
• Bioflavonoids are produced in plants and include some of the pig-
ments found in red, blue, purple, and black fruits, vegetables, and 

17
 Chapter 1: Nourishing Your Body with Superfoods
legumes. Bioflavonoids like quercetin, anthrocyanadins, and cate-
chins help to reduce inflammation, protect your heart, and reduce 
your risk of some cancers.
 
• Tannins are found in tea and red wine. Tannins may help to keep 
your digestive system healthy.
 
• Lignans are found in the cell walls of plants and have hormone-like 
properties. Flax and soy are particularly rich in lignans and may 
help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
 
✓ Carotenoids are related to vitamin A and are found in red, yellow, and 
orange pigments. Examples include beta-carotene, lycopene, and lutein. 
The carotenoids may help to keep your vision healthy, bolster your 
immune system, and reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and 
some cancers.
 
✓ Phytosterols are the plant equivalent of cholesterol. However, unlike 
the cholesterol found in animal products, phytosterols are good for you. 
Some phytosterols, such as beta-sitosterol, help to reduce the symptoms 
of an enlarged prostate and are effective for keeping your cholesterol 
levels in check.
 
Not every superfood fruit or veggie has all the phytochemicals you need. Eat a 
variety of superfoods to be sure you get all the different phytochemicals.
Creating a Healthy, Balanced 
Superfoods Diet
Creating a healthy diet requires a little planning, so start by determining how 
many calories you (and your family members) need. Knowing how many calo-
ries you need helps you determine how much and which kinds of foods you 
should eat. Superfoods have excellent nutrient-to-calorie ratios when com-
pared to other foods.
If you need to lose some weight, cut back on calories by choosing more foods 
that are high in fiber and low in fat and sugar, which describes many super-
foods. If you want to gain weight, add more energy-dense foods like olive oil, 
nuts, and seeds to your diet so you can gain weight without losing out on 
valuable nutrients.
 
You can find books and Web sites that list the calorie counts for many foods. 
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a very large database 
of nutrition information for just about every food you can think of at www.
usda.gov. Simply click Food and Nutrition from the menu on the left and 
then click What’s in the Foods You Eat – Search Tool.

18
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
The USDA also has created a food pyramid that helps guide your dietary 
choices. If counting every calorie seems tedious, you may want to keep track 
of the number of servings you have of each of the food groups instead.
How do you fit all those servings into your day? Planning your meals and 
your daily menus makes eating a healthful diet much easier. Plus it makes 
grocery shopping less of a chore. By planning your meals for a week, you can 
make a shopping list and buy all the foods and ingredients you’ll need at one 
time. You can even prepare a lot of your meals ahead of time to make eating 
healthfully easier if you have a hectic schedule. (See Chapter 15 for more on 
storing and freezing your superfoods.)
Determining how many calories you need
Calories (sometimes called kilocalories) measure the amount of energy 
available in the foods you eat. The number of calories you need every day 
depends on how old you are, how big you are, whether you’re male or 
female, how active you are, and whether you’re pregnant or nursing. When 
you get the right number of calories every day, you’ll be at a healthful weight. 
If you don’t eat enough calories, you’ll become underweight. And if you get 
too many, you’ll become overweight and possibly obese. Being overweight 
or obese increases your risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some 
cancers.
 
You can go online and find calculators to help you estimate how many calo-
ries you need every day to maintain, gain, or lose weight. Check out www.
bmi-calculator.net or www.nutritiondata.com for easy-to-use calcu-
lators. Or you can calculate your calorie needs with two formulas. The first 
one calculates how many calories you need just to be awake and breathing. 
The second formula factors in your activity level:
Forgoing fad diets
Fad diets come and go quickly, mostly because, 
in the end, they’re not particularly successful. 
The typical fad diet requires you to restrict spe-
cific foods (sometimes most or all of certain food 
groups) while claiming that you don’t need to 
watch calories, exercise, or do anything else — 
but you may need to buy expensive diet pills. 
Don’t fall for these diet claims; they don’t work 
in the long run. Fad diets may help with quick 
weight loss, but to lose weight and keep it off, 
you need to eat less, eat right, and exercise 
more. There aren’t any exceptions.

 Chapter 1: Nourishing Your Body with Superfoods
Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Formula
Women: BMR = 655 + (4.35 × weight in pounds) + (4.7 × height in inches) 
– (4.7 × age in years)
Men: BMR = 66 + (6.23 × weight in pounds) + (12.7 × height in inches) – 
(6.8 × age in years)
Harris Benedict Formula
If you’re sedentary (little or no exercise): Calorie Calculation = BMR × 1.2
If you’re lightly active (light exercise/sports 1–3 days/week): Calorie 
Calculation = BMR × 1.375
If you’re moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3–5 days/week): 
Calorie Calculation = BMR × 1.55
If you’re very active (hard exercise/sports 6–7 days a week): Calorie 
Calculation = BMR × 1.725
If you’re extra active (very hard exercise/sports and physical job or 
double training): Calorie Calculation = BMR × 1.9
For example, a 35-year-old, moderately active woman who is 5'5" tall and 
weighs 125 pounds has a BMR of 655 + (4.35 × 125) + (4.7 × 65) – (4.7 × 35), or 
1,340 calories. Because she’s moderately active, we multiply 1,340 × 1.55 for 
a grand total of 2,077, which is the number of calories she needs every day to 
maintain her weight.
We include nutrition information for all our superfoods, including calorie 
counts, so you’ll know how the superfoods fit into your daily intake of calo-
ries. Most of our superfoods are low in calories, and the ones that are more 
energy dense (higher in calories) are very rich in nutrients so you only need 
to eat a little bit to reap their rewards.
Following the food pyramid 
with superfoods
The USDA created its food pyramid to help Americans understand how many 
servings of healthful foods they need every day. You can find more information 
on the food pyramid at www.mypyramid.gov, but here’s the general idea:
 
✓ Breads and cereals: Six to eleven servings every day. At least half of 
your servings from this group should be whole-grain. Choose bread, 
plain cereals, and pasta. Avoid pastries and sugary cereals.

20
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
 
✓ Fruits and vegetables: At least 2 cups of fruit and 21/2 cups of vegetables. 
Eat fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible, and remember that 
cooking methods matter — steaming is better than boiling.
 
✓ Dairy products and calcium: Three servings every day. Choose low-fat 
milk, cheese, or yogurt.
 
✓ Meats and proteins: Two or three servings each day. Choose fish, poul-
try, eggs, lean meats, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Cut back on fatty red 
meat and avoid deep-fried meat.
 
✓ Fats and oils: Two servings of fats and oils daily, which should come 
from fish, nuts, seeds, or vegetable oils.
 
✓ Discretionary calories: The pyramid leaves just a little room for treats — 
usually about 100 to 150 calories or so per day.
Here’s how you can fit superfoods into the USDA pyramid:
 
✓ Breads and cereals: At least half of your servings from this group should 
be whole-grain. Superfood grains include oats and quinoa (see Chapter 
8). Both grains make great breakfast cereals, and quinoa can be eaten 
as a side dish. Oats can be added to bread and other baked goods, and 
sometimes oats can be used in place of flour in cooking (see Chapters 
16–19 for some ideas).
 
✓ Fruits and vegetables: We think this is the most important group 
because fruits and vegetables are packed with nutrition and fiber, and 
most people don’t eat enough of them. Superfood fruits include oranges, 
bananas, strawberries, blueberries, cherries, cranberries, and pome-
granate (see Chapter 4). All these fruits can be enjoyed as fresh snacks 
or added to healthful foods. Superfoods vegetables include spinach, 
broccoli, kale, tomatoes, avocadoes, beets, and carrots (see Chapter 5). 
They’re all terrific in salads, sides, and some main dishes.
 
✓ Dairy products and calcium: We didn’t include any dairy products in 
our list of superfoods; however, many of our superfoods go great with 
non-fat yogurt (think of a berry and nut parfait). Non-fat yogurt is a great 
source of calcium and contains beneficial bacteria that are good for 
your health. Calcium is very important for good health, and superfoods 
sources of calcium include spinach, broccoli, and kale (see Chapter 5); 
sardines (see Chapter 7); soy (see Chapter 8); and almonds and Brazil 
nuts (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Meats and proteins: Salmon, tuna, sardines, and trout are rich in 
omega-3 fatty acids and low in saturated fat, so they’re terrific as pro-
tein sources (see Chapter 7). Dry beans, soy, and lentils are high-quality 
plant proteins that can be used as substitutes for high-fat red meats (see 
Chapter 8). Nuts and seeds make great protein- and fiber-rich snacks 
(see Chapter 6).

21
 Chapter 1: Nourishing Your Body with Superfoods
 
✓ Fats and oils: Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids that 
are good for your health (see Chapter 9). Flax oil is good for you, too 
(see Chapter 6). These oils are much healthier than the saturated fats 
found in red meat and dairy products. Olive oil is good for cooking or 
for making salad dressings. You don’t want to cook with flax oil, but it 
makes a great supplemental oil or topping for salads and vegetables.
 
✓ Discretionary calories: Depending on how many calories you can have 
each day, you’ll probably want to save a few for snacks and tasty treats. 
We suggest a little dark chocolate or a small glass of wine because of 
their antioxidant properties (see Chapter 9).
Planning superfood meals and menus
The first step in planning healthful meals is to go for a balance of carbohy-
drates, proteins, and good fats, while reducing sugar, excess sodium, and 
bad fats. You can accomplish that by following the food pyramid serving 
suggestions.
The second step is to find places to fit the superfoods into your menu. 
Superfoods vegetables make great side dishes or salads. The fruits and nuts 
are perfect for snacks or dessert. The superfoods fish and legumes fit nicely 
into any dinner. Oats are great for breakfast, and there’s even room for a 
small glass of red wine with dinner or a piece of dark chocolate later on.
So what does a superfood menu look like? We suggest you start out by focus-
ing on a healthful, balanced diet that includes two superfoods each day. Your 
day could look something like this:
 
✓ Breakfast: Oatmeal with low-fat milk, raisins, and honey; one slice of 
toast with peanut butter; and coffee. Oatmeal counts as your first super-
food of the day.
 
✓ Mid-morning snack: Celery sticks with veggie dip.
 
✓ Lunch: Chicken sandwich with light mayonnaise, one slice of cheese, 
and lettuce on whole-grain bread, and a small green salad with no more 
than 2 tablespoons of salad dressing.
 
✓ Mid-afternoon snack: Six crackers with thin slices of cheese, one sliced 
pear, and a diet soft drink.
 
✓ Dinner: Roast beef, a baked potato with light sour cream, and a side 
of steamed broccoli with a dab of butter or non-trans-fat margarine. 
Broccoli is your second superfood for the day.
 
✓ Evening snack: One cup of flavored yogurt.

22
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
As you can see, a daily menu like this has plenty of food and flavor without 
sacrificing good nutrition. And it’s easy to add even more superfoods. The 
following meal plan incorporates five:
 
✓ Breakfast: Oatmeal with low-fat milk, blueberries, and honey; one slice 
of toast with peanut butter; and coffee. Oatmeal is your first superfood, 
and blueberries are your second.
 
✓ Mid-morning snack: One apple with one slice of cheddar cheese and 
water. The apple is your third superfood.
 
✓ Lunch: Bowl of low-sodium chicken noodle soup, one whole-grain roll, 
and a green salad with no more than 2 tablespoons salad dressing.
 
✓ Mid-afternoon snack: A single-serving bag of almonds. Almonds are your 
fourth superfood.
 
✓ Dinner: Baked salmon with mashed potatoes and green beans. Salmon is 
your fifth superfood for the day.
 
✓ Evening snack: One cup of flavored yogurt.
These are just two examples of superfoods menus — throughout the book, 
we describe more ways to fit superfoods into your day. Enjoying a super-
foods diet is easy and delicious.
Taking the First Steps toward a 
Healthier You with Superfoods
Now that you’re armed with nutrition information and you know how to plan 
your meals, it’s time to get started on your superfoods diet. In the following 
chapters, we tell you more about superfoods, how to prepare them, and how 
to fit each of them into your superfoods diet. Here’s your game plan:
 
✓ Read the rest of this book. We don’t mind if you jump around the book 
and read whichever chapters interest you the most first. The book con-
tains a lot of information on superfoods, and we know you’ll discover 
a lot.
 
✓ Start with two superfoods each day and increase the number as you 
feel comfortable. We’ve mentioned a few superfoods in this chapter (or 
you can look ahead for more), so you can get started with your super-
foods regimen right away.
 
✓ Reduce the amount of foods you eat that are bad for your health. That 
includes the fatty red meats, deep-fried foods, sugary foods, greasy 

23
 Chapter 1: Nourishing Your Body with Superfoods
snack foods, and foods that are heavily processed. Replace those bad 
foods with good foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean 
meats, nuts, seeds, legumes, and low-fat dairy products.
 
✓ Keep a food diary to help you keep track of your superfoods diet. 
Writing down the foods you eat and the beverages you drink every day 
improves your chances of turning your new dietary changes into a per-
manent lifestyle. You really don’t need anything fancy; a small notebook 
will do. At the end of every day, you can see whether your food choices 
were good or bad and how many superfoods you ate.
 
✓ Exercise. The American Heart Association recommends a minimum 
of 30 minutes of exercise five days a week. Exercise works along with 
superfoods to help you manage your weight and promote a healthy 
heart.
 
✓ Get your family and friends involved. It’s much easier to accomplish 
diet and exercise goals when you do it with a partner. Lead by example 
and rope some friends or family members into a healthy lifestyle.
If at first you don’t succeed . . . don’t give up! Rome wasn’t built in a day and 
you don’t have to change your diet overnight. It’s okay if you slip up — just 
start again and continue to make healthier food choices and add more super-
foods. Ultimately, your superfoods diet will last a lifetime (and a long one at 
that!).

Appreciating the Ageless 
Wonders of Superfoods
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the healthy benefits of superfoods
▶ Unlocking anti-aging abilities
▶ Starting off on the right foot — superfoods for children
P
eople today typically eat for pleasure rather than for good nutrition. 
Unfortunately, there just aren’t many health benefits in most of the 
foods we eat for pleasure. If eating a candy bar could decrease your blood 
pressure or reduce your risk for cancer, we’d have one heck of a healthy 
population — but this just isn’t the case.
One of the reasons people don’t choose healthier food is because they 
haven’t been educated on the health benefits of eating the good stuff. But 
read on, because in this chapter we tell you how the foods you and your kids 
eat can affect — and even improve — your health, perhaps resulting in fewer 
visits to the doctor. Of course, we aren’t suggesting that doctors are bad 
guys, but if reducing your number of doctor visits each year simply by eating 
more healthfully is possible, why not?
Boosting Your Immune System
As you may expect, superfoods are good immune-system boosters, helping 
your body fight and prevent various diseases. Research on the abilities of 
certain foods to strengthen immune function, fight against heart disease, 
prevent cancer, and lower the risk of other inflammatory diseases has been 
consistently increasing. Of course, cancer is much less common than colds 

26
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
and minor infections. Fortunately, superfoods can help with these everyday 
ailments, too. Here are two good examples:
 
✓ Resveratrol, a compound found in red wine, has been shown to be quite 
beneficial. It has antiviral properties and can help prevent common cold 
viruses from taking hold in your body. It’s also being studied extensively 
in anti-aging medicine, and early results are pointing at a breakthrough 
in this area (see Chapter 9 and the section “Aging Beautifully” later in 
this chapter for more info).
 
✓ Garlic has been used as a natural antibiotic for more than a century. 
Louis Pasteur studied the use of garlic as an antibiotic and found that 
it killed bacteria in the lab. (See Chapters 9 and 20 for more on garlic’s 
superfood qualities.)
 
 If you’re on any medications, see your doctor before you add high doses 
of garlic to your regimen. Garlic can interfere with certain medication 
functions.
 
Superfoods have some great properties to help the body’s immune system. 
However, if you’re thinking of taking any superfood supplements, talk to your 
doctor first. Supplements, even those with superfood properties, can interact 
negatively with certain medications, so it’s vital to discuss diet and supplements 
with your physician. See Chapters 3 and 21 for details on dietary supplements.
Helping Your Heart
Your heart pumps about 2,000 gallons of blood throughout your whole body 
every day, but most people don’t appreciate that workload. You don’t have 
to consciously think about your heartbeat, so it’s easy to take your heart for 
granted. Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a serious medical condition to 
become aware of your heart — by which time you may already have heart 
disease.
Heart disease is still the leading cause of death in both men and women, so 
reducing risks should be a priority for both genders. Superfoods can help 
by tackling cholesterol and triglycerides, believed to be major risk factors 
for cardiovascular disease. (Not sure what cholesterol and triglycerides are? 
Check out the nearby sidebar.)
 
The American Heart Association recommends that everyone 20 years of age 
and older have a fasting cholesterol profile test every five years. This test mea-
sures your total cholesterol and triglyceride levels to keep an eye on your risk 
for cardiovascular disease. If you have any underlying health conditions, such 
as hypothyroidism, diabetes, liver disease, or other cardiovascular risks, your 
doctor may want to run this profile more frequently. Once patients reach the 
age of 40, most doctors check their cholesterol yearly.

27
 Chapter 2: Appreciating the Ageless Wonders of Superfoods
Superfoods work to keep your heart healthy and improve your ticker’s lon-
gevity without the potential side effects or additional expense of cholesterol-
lowering prescription medications. They can really make a difference in your 
heart’s health. Here’s how:
 
✓ Eating superfoods means you’re improving your overall diet and getting 
the vitamins and minerals you need every day — without extra calories. 
Too many extra calories cause elevations in triglycerides (see sidebar) 
and an increased risk for heart disease.
 
✓ Some superfoods, such as colorful fruits and vegetables (see Chapters 4 
and 5 for foods that fill the bill), contain natural disease-fighting substances 
Cholesterol and triglycerides
Cholesterol is a fat-like substance that’s essen-
tial for normal body function. It plays a role in 
producing cell membranes and hormones. 
Triglycerides are a type of fat that makes up 
one portion of the cholesterol.
Cholesterol is found in different forms in your 
body. One form is “good” cholesterol, called 
high density lipoprotein (HDL), and the other is 
“bad” cholesterol, called low density lipopro-
tein (LDL). These lipoproteins are actually pro-
tein molecules that carry cholesterol through 
your bloodstream. LDL, the bad form, carries 
cholesterol from the liver, where it’s made, to 
the rest of your body. HDL, the good form, car-
ries cholesterol back to the liver, where it’s 
removed from your body.
You need to know your ratio of HDL to LDL to 
determine just what harm cholesterol may be 
doing to your heart (your doctor can draw your 
blood and perform a fasting cholesterol profile 
test to determine your ratio). You want to have 
higher levels of HDL and lower levels of LDL, 
because that means your body is getting rid 
of extra cholesterol. When your blood has too 
much LDL and too little HDL, the cholesterol may 
combine with other substances to form plaques 
on the walls of your arteries. Plaques make 
your arteries narrow and less flexible, which 
leads to a condition called atherosclerosis. 
Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow, often lead-
ing to strokes and heart attacks.
About 2/3 of the cholesterol in your body is pro-
duced in your liver, and the rest comes from the 
foods you eat. Your body needs cholesterol for 
certain functions; in most cases, the liver pro-
duces what the body will use and doesn’t need 
extra. The balance between good cholesterol 
and bad is often determined by the food choices 
you make. Foods high in dietary cholesterol and 
saturated fats increase your bad cholesterol 
and decrease your good cholesterol. To make 
matters worse, some people inherit genes that 
actually cause the body to make more bad cho-
lesterol and less of the good kind. Unhealthy 
levels of cholesterol can build up quickly in people 
who inherit this condition of over-production.
When you consume more calories than you 
need, your body turns the extra calories into 
triglycerides that are stored in your fat cells for 
later use. Triglycerides are grouped in with the 
LDL as bad cholesterol because high levels of 
triglycerides are thought to lead to plaque build-
up in the arteries. No one knows exactly how 
triglycerides are involved in plaque formation, 
but high levels have been consistently linked 
to heart disease. Researchers are continually 
trying to discover exactly how elevated triglyc-
erides affect the body.

28
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
called flavonoids. These can reduce inflammation of your arteries, 
decrease your cholesterol, lower your blood pressure, and stimulate 
antioxidant activity. Antioxidants repair damage done to the cells in 
your body by smoking, pollution, poisons, fried foods, and also as a by-
product of normal metabolism.
 
✓ Fish, nuts, and seeds all contain healthful polyunsaturated fatty acids 
that keep your cholesterol in check. Fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids) is 
particularly super because it also helps regulate your heartbeat and 
your blood pressure. (See Chapter 6 for the lowdown on nuts and seeds, 
Chapter 21 for info on omega-3 fatty acids, and Chapter 7 for more fish 
facts.)
 
✓ Fruits, vegetables, and oatmeal (see Chapters 8 and 20 for more on this 
powerful grain) all contain dietary fiber that lowers cholesterol and 
helps keep you feeling full, which can prevent overeating, a risk factor 
for heart disease.
Losing Weight
More than 70 percent of the United States’ adult population is overweight, 
and a third of that population is obese. Overweight is defined as having a 
body mass index (BMI) over 25. Adults with a BMI over 30 are considered 
obese. (The “Body Mass Index” sidebar tells you how to calculate your BMI.) 
Obesity is the second most preventable health risk, just behind smoking. 
It’s a problem worldwide and one that just keeps getting bigger (no pun 
intended).
Body Mass Index
Body Mass Index (BMI) is an indirect way 
of calculating your percentage of body fat. 
Calculating BMI is easier and less expensive 
than direct-measurement tests, and, accord-
ing to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), BMI is an accurate reflection 
of the results of direct body-fat measurement. 
The BMI formula for adults is:
 
 Your weight in pounds divided by your 
height in inches squared, times 703.
So, if you weigh 150 pounds and you’re 5 feet 5 
inches tall, your BMI formula looks like this:
 
 150 ÷ 652 × 703 = 24.96
The CDC Web site has BMI calculators for 
adults, children, and teenagers. You can check 
them out at www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/
dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/
bmi/index.htm.

29
 Chapter 2: Appreciating the Ageless Wonders of Superfoods
Another problem is how quickly this overweight epidemic has spread to chil-
dren. The World Health Organization estimates that 20 million children under 
the age of five are obese. Children are being diagnosed with high cholesterol, 
high blood pressure, and diabetes — all previously thought to be exclusively 
the problems of adults — at alarming rates. Why is this happening?
As with heart disease, poor eating and physical inactivity are largely respon-
sible for weight gain. Weight loss isn’t easy, but for many people it’s neces-
sary to restore and maintain good health. Don’t worry; we help you choose 
the superfoods that, along with a healthful diet and exercise plan, can help 
you lose the extra weight. Some superfoods that fill this bill include omega-3 
fatty acids (see Chapters 7 and 21), green tea (see Chapters 9 and 21), dark 
chocolate (yes, dark chocolate — see Chapter 9), and chia (an edible seed 
that absorbs water and keeps you feeling full for hours; see Chapter 10).
Protecting Against Cancer
When people are asked what health condition they fear the most, cancer is 
the number one answer. This is a justifiable fear as cancer is the second lead-
ing cause of death in the United States, just behind heart disease. Although 
many people believe that cancer is an uncontrollable health condition, evi-
dence suggests otherwise, and some of the superfoods may help to prevent 
cancer and improve the well-being of cancer patients.
We’ve seen success story after success story where people defied their prog-
noses and beat cancer, and we think that eating healthy foods had a lot to do 
with it. The role of nutrition in the prevention of cancer has been studied for 
many years. The largest cancer research organization in the United Kingdom, 
World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), supports the notion that between 35 
and 70 percent of cancer is related to eating an unhealthy diet. A healthy diet 
rich in superfoods, on the other hand, may decrease your risk of many cancers.
Many superfoods have cancer-fighting properties. In general, you should seek 
those foods with the highest amounts of phytochemicals, fiber, and antioxi-
dants. For example:
 
✓ Lycopene, a phytochemical found in tomatoes, is being studied for its reduc-
tion of risk for prostate cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, 
foods rich in lycopene may lower the risk of other cancers as well; however, 
more research is needed. See Chapters 5 and 20 for more on tomatoes.
 
✓ Berries (see Chapters 4 and 20) contain phytochemicals that have been 
shown to help fight the development of cancer. These phytochemicals 
trigger antioxidant reactions that neutralize damage done to your cells.

✓ Red wine contains two polyphenols called catechins and resveratrol, 
both of which provide cancer protection by inhibiting the growth of 
cancer cells. See Chapter 9 for more info on the wonders of wine.
 
✓ Broccoli (see Chapter 5) contains a chemical that has been found to 
slow down the progression of cancer cells, especially hormone-sensitive 
cancers such as breast and ovarian cancer.
 
✓ A lot of money has been spent on research to explore the cancer-fighting 
properties of garlic and garlic extracts. Several studies already support 
the theory that garlic can reduce the risk of cancer, and more studies 
are underway to explore exactly how garlic functions in cancer protec-
tion. See Chapters 9 and 20 for the lowdown on garlic.
 
✓ Several beans (legumes) are great sources of fiber, which has been proven 
to help reduce inflammation in the colon and has been associated with a 
reduction of colon cancer. See Chapter 8 for more info on legumes.
Improving Digestion
Most people suffer digestive stress at one time or another. For example, con-
stipation is common and can lead to abdominal bloating, hemorrhoids, and 
unnecessary pain. Indigestion or acid reflux (heartburn) is a common cause 
of emergency department visits and can lead to damage in the esophagus if 
not treated. Regularity of the digestive system is important for the proper 
metabolism of the foods you eat so they can be utilized by the body.
One way to help your digestive system is to eat foods with lots of fiber. The 
average diet consists of about 10 grams of fiber a day — far less than the 25 
to 40 grams per day that your body needs. Boost your fiber intake by adding 
superfood fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, and legumes to your diet. The 
following list contains just a few superfoods that are high in fiber (see the 
accompanying chapter cross references for more details on the benefits they 
have to offer):
 
✓ Almonds (Chapters 6 and 20)
 
✓ Apples (Chapter 4)
 
✓ Avocados (Chapter 5)
 
✓ Black beans (Chapter 8)
 
✓ Broccoli (Chapter 5)
 
✓ Chia (Chapters 10 and 20)
 
✓ Lentils (Chapter 8)

31
 Chapter 2: Appreciating the Ageless Wonders of Superfoods
 
✓ Lima beans (Chapter 8)
 
✓ Oatmeal (Chapters 8 and 20)
 
✓ Quinoa (Chapter 8)
 
✓ Blueberries (Chapter 4)
 
✓ Soy beans (Chapter 8)
 
Water isn’t on our list of superfoods, but it’s a great addition to your diet to 
help some of the super-fiber foods work better. Drinking half your body weight 
(in ounces) of water each day helps counter the fluids that fiber absorbs. If 
you weigh 120 pounds, for example, you should aim to drink 60 ounces of 
water a day.
 
Good digestive health is very important for the body to absorb nutrients and 
water, so make sure you’re getting your daily fiber and alert your doctor with 
any concerns.
Easing Inflammation
When it comes to staying healthy, your body is always in a tug-of-war with 
detriments like pollution, unhealthy foods, smoke, too much alcohol, exces-
sive sunlight, and even the side effects of fighting infections and digesting 
high-fat meals. Exposure to these things causes cell damage and inflamma-
tion (the body’s response to this damage, such as tissue swelling, redness, 
A fiber primer
If you aren’t sure what fiber is and why it’s good 
for you, you’re not alone. Fiber is the part of 
plant foods (fruits, vegetables, grains) that can’t 
be broken down by your digestive system. Fiber 
is important for your health — it keeps your 
digestive system healthy and helps to control 
blood sugar levels.
There are two types of fiber:
 ✓ Insoluble fiber: This type of fiber doesn’t 
dissolve in water and cannot be digested. 
It absorbs water and bulks the stool to help 
regulate bowel movements. Insoluble fiber 
is found in grains and some vegetables.
 ✓ Soluble fiber: This type of fiber dissolves 
in water, forming a gel-like substance 
that moves through the intestines. Found 
in fruits, vegetables, and legumes, soluble 
fiber is associated with lowering choles-
terol and controlling blood sugar.
A food is considered to have a high fiber con-
tent when it has more than five grams of fiber 
per serving.

and triggering of the immune system). Chronic inflammation, or inflammation 
that happens over and over again, can lead to problems in many areas of the 
body, such as the joints, the heart, the colon, and even the skin.
Your body works hard to fight inflammation and cell damage. You can give 
your body an edge in this tug-of-war by eating superfoods rich in antioxidants 
and prostaglandins, which we discuss in the following sections.
The role of antioxidants
Antioxidants are natural substances, such as the compounds that give fruits 
and vegetables their colors, and vitamins like C and E, which fight cell 
damage. They work to fight inflammation by neutralizing free radicals in the 
body. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can travel throughout the 
body trying to take particles from healthy cells — a process that creates 
more free radicals. Free radicals damage cells, causing inflammation and 
starting a chain reaction in tissues as more and more cells become affected.
Superfoods are packed with antioxidants that move through the body and 
stop the free radicals so they don’t damage healthy cells. Many of the super-
foods that we discuss in this book have antioxidant properties. Here are some 
of the most powerful ones (see the chapters referenced for more specifics):
 
✓ Acai berries (Chapter 10)
 
✓ Blueberries (Chapters 4 and 20)
 
✓ Broccoli (Chapter 5)
 
✓ Cranberries (Chapter 4)
 
✓ Green tea (Chapters 9 and 21)
 
✓ Pomegranate (Chapter 4)
 
✓ Spinach (Chapters 5 and 20)
Fats and inflammation
Your body makes chemicals called prostaglandins that contribute to starting 
or stopping inflammation reactions in your body (depending on the type of 
prostaglandins). Have you ever taken aspirin or ibuprofen for a headache? 
These medicines stop inflammation by blocking the prostaglandins. That’s great, 
but sometimes they have rather unpleasant side effects; for example, some 
people experience an upset stomach when they take aspirin or ibuprofen.
Some foods can increase the amount of inflammatory prostaglandins (the 
bad ones) and decrease the amount of anti-inflammatory prostaglandins (the 

33
 Chapter 2: Appreciating the Ageless Wonders of Superfoods
good ones) in your body. Eating these foods increases inflammation in your 
body. Eating a diet high in saturated fat (a type of fat found in red meat; see 
the sidebar “Not all fats are alike” for more info) is a major cause of this pros-
taglandin imbalance and the resulting inflammation. Fortunately, there are 
superfoods that combat that inflammation.
Unlike saturated fats, unsaturated fats are actually good for the body. They 
come in two forms: polyunsaturated and monounsaturated (see the nearby 
sidebar for details on the differences).
A type of polyunsaturated fat known as omega-3 fatty acids is especially good 
for you. Omega-3s have been researched extensively and found to reduce 
inflammation. This means that eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids can 
help prevent heart disease, cancer, and arthritis.
Not all fats are alike
While fats have generally gotten a bad reputa-
tion, not all fats are bad. Knowing the difference 
between good fats and bad fats can have a sig-
nificant impact on your health.
Saturated fats get their name from being satu-
rated with hydrogen atoms. They can cause an 
unhealthy build-up of cholesterol (LDL, the bad 
cholesterol) and triglycerides in the body if con-
sumed in excess — not a good thing. Saturated 
fats are found in foods from animal sources, 
such as meat and dairy products. Baked, fried, 
and processed foods are unfortunately also 
big donors of this unhealthy fat. The American 
Heart Association recommends that saturated 
fats comprise no more than 7 percent of your 
daily caloric intake.
Trans fats can be found in processed foods, 
some stick margarines, and baked goods. Trans 
fats are created by a process called hydroge-
nation, whereby the polyunsaturated fats in 
vegetable oils are structurally altered. This 
alteration makes the oil more solid (kind of like 
saturated fats — think of butter that stays fairly 
solid at room temperature) and helps to slow 
down spoilage of the oil.
Unfortunately, it also turns healthy vegetable 
oils into unhealthy trans fats that are even 
worse for your heart and your health than satu-
rated fats. Why? Because after being “partially 
hydrogenated,” the trans fats are more like 
saturated fats and less like the healthy polyun-
saturated fats.
Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, are actually 
beneficial to your health. Polyunsaturated fats 
are simple fats with many (poly) double carbon 
bonds, while monounsaturated fats are simple 
fats with only one double carbon bond. You can 
feel good about eating these kinds of fat. Unlike 
saturated fats that increase bad cholesterol, 
unsaturated fats actually raise the good cho-
lesterol and lower the bad. Monounsaturated 
fats are found in olive oil, nuts, and avocados. 
Polyunsaturated fats are found in canola oil, 
soy, nuts, seeds, fish, and seafood. Omega-3 
fatty acids are one form of polyunsaturated fats 
that are particularly good for you because they 
fight inflammation in your body. You’ll find these 
fats in fish, seafood, soy, canola oil, flax, chia, 
walnuts, and pumpkin seeds.

34
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
You have to get these fats from the foods you eat; your body can’t produce 
them. So, if you don’t get enough from your diet, it’s important to take a 
good-quality supplement. (See Chapter 7 for more on superfoods high in 
omega-3 fatty acids, and Chapters 3 and 21 for info on using supplements.)
Monounsaturated fat is also good for you. It’s the fat found in olive oil, and it 
may be one big reason why people who eat Mediterranean diets tend to be 
very healthy.
The following superfoods are packed with good poly- and monounsaturated fats:
 
✓ Fish and seafood contain lots of omega-3 fats (see Chapter 7).
 
✓ Chia, walnuts, and flax seeds are great plant sources of omega-3s (see 
Chapters 10 and 20 for more on chia and Chapter 6 for the lowdown on 
nuts and seeds).
 
✓ Avocados and olive oil are healthy monounsaturated fats (see Chapter 5 
for a discussion of avocados, and Chapters 9 and 20 for details on olive oil).
These are just a few of the many superfood options that can help pump up 
your body’s anti-inflammatory defense system. See the chapters in Part II to 
find out more specifics, including the recommended servings per day.
Aging Beautifully
Superfoods do a lot of things, but trying to turn a frog into a prince might be 
pushing it. Offering some benefits that can help you live a longer and more 
vigorous life, however, is definitely within their call of duty.
Eating superfoods helps you stay youthful, and the earlier you start with 
superfoods, the more age-defying benefits you can gain. Of course, these 
foods need to be a piece of the whole puzzle, not the sole solution for beauti-
ful skin and a healthy body. Don’t forget about smart lifestyle choices — like 
exercising regularly, giving up smoking, and so on — too.
Keeping that youthful glow
The health and beauty sections of every store from Wal-Mart to Macy’s are 
stuffed with creams, lotions, cleansers, moisturizers, and make-up designed 
to minimize the signs of aging. But a diet that includes superfoods can do just 
as much — and even more — to keep your skin healthy and young-looking.

35
 Chapter 2: Appreciating the Ageless Wonders of Superfoods
The skin deals with so many different factors — sun, pollution, extreme 
weather, and other irritants — that it needs a continual supply of antioxi-
dants to help protect it. Fortunately, superfoods are chock-full of many of the 
main nutrients your skin needs, including:
 
✓ Vitamins A, E, and C: These are all common additions to popular skin 
creams because they’re helpful in protecting the skin and vital in repair-
ing damaged skin. Common foods that contain high levels of these vita-
mins include carrots (vitamin A); nuts and seeds (vitamin E); spinach 
(vitamins A and E); and broccoli, strawberries, and oranges (vitamin 
C). See Chapter 4 for more on the benefits of strawberries and oranges; 
Chapter 5 for details on carrots, broccoli, and spinach; and Chapter 6 for 
the lowdown on nuts and seeds.
 
✓ Zinc and selenium: Zinc, which is active in the synthesis of collagen, 
is another common addition to sunscreens and skin lotions. Pumpkin 
seeds (see Chapter 6) are an excellent source of zinc, as are nuts and 
beans. Selenium exhibits antioxidant effects that have been found to 
reduce skin cancer. Selenium is found in fish and nuts (especially Brazil 
nuts — see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Bioflavonoids: Sometimes known as “vitamin P” because of their many 
benefits, bioflavonoids aren’t really vitamins. They’re the pigments found 
in the skins of colorful fruits and vegetables. These pigments contain 
concentrated antioxidants that actually are more powerful than vita-
mins. They help increase vitamin C levels and reduce destruction of col-
lagen in the skin.
 
✓ Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA): This is a fatty acid made by the body and 
found in foods such as broccoli and spinach. Although the body 
produces ALA, it doesn’t make nearly enough to be helpful for fight-
ing disease and inflammation. Plus, your body produces less as you 
age, so making sure you get enough from your diet becomes even 
more important the older you get. Alpha-lipoic acid not only has 
antioxidant properties, but also can help recycle some vitamins and 
other antioxidants.
Pumping up your pep
Gaining some super sensations from what you eat and drink is a common 
goal. How often have you told co-workers you need coffee or chocolate or an 
“energy” drink to get you through the slumps in your day? The problem with 
artificial stimulants is that they often pose unwanted dangers to your body. 
Plus, many of these options are high in sugar and artificial additives. A better 
option: Go natural and use superfoods to put some pep in your step.

36
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
Getting a natural boost of energy is important not only for getting through 
your daily routine, but also for summoning extra energy to tackle your exer-
cise program or other activities. When you use the right foods and eat small 
meals throughout the day, you can really ramp up your metabolism and get 
that extra energy you need.
If you’re on the go and can’t find the time to grab a healthy meal, these super-
foods can be a great option:
 
✓ Goji berries: Rich in antioxidants, goji berries (see Chapter 10) have 
been used in Chinese medicine for years. They’ve also been found to 
help boost energy and enhance your mood.
 
✓ Green tea: This is another superfood that has been used for hundreds 
of years. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that green tea’s 
effect on energy was similar to that of caffeine. (Check out Chapter 9 for 
more on green tea and Chapter 21 for info on green tea extract.)
 
✓ Chia seed: The Aztecs used chia seeds to prepare for battles and long 
explorations. The seeds can absorb ten times their weight and are slow 
to digest, offering sustained energy for several hours. Chia seeds can be 
added to protein shakes or other meals to help give you that sustained 
energy throughout the day. (See Chapters 10 and 20 for more on chia.)
 
✓ Quinoa: This protein-rich seed, though considered a grain, is actually 
a leafy plant that’s related to spinach and beets, and it can give you a 
power punch. Much as Aztecs used chia, the Incas used quinoa as a 
source of energy for their battles. (See Chapter 8 for more on quinoa.)
Superfood supplements
Superfood supplements are really exploding 
onto the scene, and many manufacturers claim 
they can get more of some of the superfood 
qualities in supplements than you can get by 
eating healthful foods. Superfoods supple-
ments give your nutrition a boost by concen-
trating some of the nutrients, but they shouldn’t 
replace the healthy foods in your diet. You need 
to continue to eat wholesome foods that pro-
vide you with fiber, protein, and other nutrients 
that build your body and keep you strong. Eating 
a junk food diet is unhealthy no matter what 
supplements you take.
Superfood supplements are great for those 
times when you’re under a lot of stress, trying 
to lose weight, or fighting infections, or if you’re 
a picky eater. But your best option still is to get 
the energy-building properties you need from 
the food you eat, rather than solely from a sup-
plement bottle. See Chapter 3 to find out more 
about supplements’ benefits and limitations.

 Chapter 2: Appreciating the Ageless Wonders of Superfoods
Seeing — and believing
Many bodily functions change with age, and vision is no exception. Many 
people develop the need for some type of visual correction as they grow 
older. Just like other age-related conditions that can be alleviated by super-
foods, the eyes can be aided by the following superfood constituents:
 
✓ Beta carotene: You’ve probably heard that eating carrots is supposed to 
help improve your vision and reduce your risk for macular degeneration, 
a progressive disease of the retina that affects the light-sensing cells, 
causing blurring or blind spots in your central vision. That’s because 
carrots (see Chapter 5) contain a lot of beta carotene, a precursor to 
vitamin A. Beta carotene is virtually a staple ingredient in vision-related 
nutritional supplements.
 
✓ Acanthocyanins: These are bioflavonoids that give color to the skin of 
fruits and veggies. Their antioxidant properties help protect not only 
your eyes, but other organ systems as well.
 
✓ Lutein: Lutein is concentrated in your retinas. Carrots have high levels 
of lutein. Other good sources are broccoli, spinach, and orange and 
yellow fruits. Kale not only has lutein but also is a great source of vita-
min A. (See Chapter 5 for more on the benefits of broccoli, spinach, car-
rots, and kale.)
 
✓ Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3s protect the light-sensing cells in your 
eyes. One Harvard study found that people who eat fish at least 
twice a week cut their risk of developing age-related macular degen-
eration in half. Other studies found that omega-3s also may be help-
ful in reducing cataracts. (See Chapter 7 for more on omega-3 fatty 
acids.)
Understanding the Benefits of 
Superfoods for Your Children
The earlier you incorporate superfoods into your diet, the sooner you can 
benefit from all the advantages superfoods offer. And this is true for your 
children, too. Get them started eating superfoods at a young age, and you’ll 
be instilling healthy habits that can serve them for a (perhaps longer) life-
time. Not only that, but you’ll also be helping their immune systems, promot-
ing strong bones and teeth, and helping them maintain a healthy weight, at a 
time when their young bodies can use all the help they can get.

38
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
 
Turn to Chapter 12 for advice on making superfoods kid-friendly. It’s not as 
hard as you may think!
Protecting kids’ immune systems
The immune system is a collection of systems and reactions in the body that 
act as its defense mechanism against any factors that may attempt to make 
the body weak or ill. Foes include everything from bacteria and viruses to 
inflammation and cancer. It’s a tough job, considering how many different 
organisms can cause disease. Getting the immune system bulked up, armed, 
and ready for battle is important at all ages of life.
Setting the stage for a healthy immune system starts at birth. Mothers often 
breast-feed their infants to pass along antibodies (protective immune-system 
cells) until the baby’s body can produce its own. As children grow, getting 
them to eat the recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables each day 
gives their bodies antioxidants to protect against all kinds of cell damage, 
and reduces their risk of cancer in the future. Because they’re naturally 
sweet, fruits are a logical substitute for high-sugar snacks like cookies.
 
Sugar-dense snacks can actually weaken the immune system. They’ve also 
been found to increase inflammation in the body.
 
Once your children are over the age of 3 (due to the risk of allergies), you 
can grind walnuts, pecans, or almonds and sprinkle them on other foods like 
cereals, eggs, or sandwiches. You can do the same with chia and berries, too. 
Often, your child won’t even taste the difference.
Garlic has great antibiotic activity. Not only does it boost the immune system 
to fight against the common cold, but also strong evidence exists that garlic 
plays a role in reducing your risk for cancer. (See Chapters 9 and 20 for more 
on the wonders of garlic.) Because garlic has such a strong taste, you may 
need to introduce it to your children in graduated amounts — although some 
kids love the taste, especially as they get older.
 
If your child absolutely refuses to eat anything with garlic in it, you can try 
having her take an odorless garlic supplement.
Building strong bones and teeth
The bones in your child’s body need a rich source of nutrients for a good 
long time; the most important period of bone growth occurs before the age of 

39
 Chapter 2: Appreciating the Ageless Wonders of Superfoods
35. Children who eat foods that help build the strongest frame early on have 
a lower risk of weak bones as they age. Teeth also need certain minerals to 
become strong and to reduce the risk of cavities.
 
Diets high in caffeinated and carbonated drinks are major contributors to 
decreased bone strength, which can lead to fractures and fragile bones.
The most important factor for building strong bones and teeth is a calcium-
rich diet. Dairy is the number one calcium contributor, but there are other 
great superfood options, such as soy milk or orange juice fortified with cal-
cium. Many green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach, and the 
legume family are also excellent sources of calcium.
 
Children between the ages of 2 and 8 should get at least the equivalent of 2 
cups of milk a day. Children ages 9 and older should consume 3 cups or more 
a day.
 
Milk has been thought of as the gold standard, but you can actually get more 
calcium by adding yogurt into a kid’s daily meal plan. Most children like 
yogurt, and choosing yogurts packed with fruit — or adding your own — gives 
your child a double nutritional punch.
 
Some children get accustomed to consuming a few foods and put up quite a 
struggle when faced with change. If your kids are picky eaters, you may want 
to consider supplemental nutrients to ensure they’re getting all they need. See 
Chapter 3 for more information on superfood supplements, and Chapter 12 for 
tips on working with picky eaters.
Figuring out the fluoride question
In 1930, fluoride was found to be important 
in the development of teeth and reduction of 
disease. Check with your pediatrician to see 
whether your child requires fluoride supple-
mentation. Fluoride is often found in municipal 
water supplies — call your local water com-
pany to find out how much fluoride your tap 
water contains.
Most foods have some fluoride, but often not 
enough to make a difference. You can get 
higher concentrations of fluoride in citrus fruits 
and lettuce, but your children still need other 
sources for growing teeth. Using toothpaste 
with fluoride and fluorinated water are good 
alternatives to supplements. If you find that your 
water source doesn’t have enough fluoride (0.7 
to 1.2 parts per million, or ppm), your doctor or 
dentist may prescribe drops or tablets. If you 
have any questions about fluoride, ask your 
doctor or dentist for some guidance.

Helping maintain a healthy weight
Childhood obesity is rising at a staggering rate, and poor diet and decreasing 
activity levels are the main causes. Replacing highly processed junk foods 
(that are full of refined sugar, saturated fats, and calories) with superfoods 
can be one huge step towards slowing down this problem.
Getting your children to eat superfoods at a young age will help them grow 
into lean and healthy adolescents and adults. Add extra superfood vegetables 
at mealtimes to keep them feeling full without adding lots of calories. Serve 
superfood fruits and berries as sweet desserts instead of cookies, cake, and 
ice cream. Nuts and seeds make nutritious between-meal snacks.
The early years of life are some of the most important for the growth and 
development that will carry your children into adulthood. Staying at a 
healthy weight by eating superfoods will not only reduce their risk of obesity-
related diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, but the antioxidants and 
other helpful nutrients will help prevent other diseases as well.

Chapter 3
Supplementing Superfoods
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how dietary supplements work
▶ Evaluating the pros and cons of taking supplements
▶ Knowing what to look for and where to find it
Your body doesn’t make many of the essential nutrients it needs, so you 
must get most of them from your diet. But what happens if you don’t get 
all of those needed nutrients even from a diet rich in superfoods? Maybe you 
don’t eat as many servings of fruits and vegetables as you need every day, or 
maybe you don’t eat the most nutritious foods. In either case, you may need 
more nutrients than your diet provides, and you may want to consider using 
dietary supplements.
Let’s be clear: Supplements are no substitute for real food, superfoods, or 
a healthy, balanced diet — and they aren’t appropriate for everyone. They 
shouldn’t be used as meal replacements. Supplements can be packed with 
vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, but they don’t contain natural sources 
of fiber, carbohydrates, and proteins necessary for bodily functions. Used 
judiciously, however, they may help you to fill in the gaps in an otherwise 
superfood-rich diet.
In this chapter, we take the mystery out of supplements. We explain their 
benefits and their potential hazards, and give you some guidance to help you 
decide whether they’re right for you. And we offer tips on what to look for — 
and where to look — when choosing the supplements you want.
Understanding How Dietary 
Supplements Work
Federal law defines a dietary supplement as “a product (other than tobacco) 
that is intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more 
of the following dietary ingredients: a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other 

42
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement 
the diet by increasing the total daily intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, con-
stituent, extract, or combinations” of these ingredients. The law also speci-
fies that a supplement must be in the form of a pill, tablet, capsule, or liquid, 
must not be intended to replace food, and must be labeled as a “dietary 
supplement.” Beyond that, though, manufacturers have a lot of leeway in how 
they make and market their supplements.
That doesn’t mean supplements are bad. In fact, some of them go beyond 
mere supplementation and may help to prevent — or, in some cases, even 
treat — certain diseases. However, your body isn’t nearly as efficient in 
absorbing nutrients from supplements as it is in absorbing nutrients from 
food. So supplements can’t take the place of a healthy, balanced diet (liber-
ally dosed with superfoods, of course).
Exploring the difference between 
foods and supplements
The main difference between vitamins and minerals found in the foods 
you eat and the nutrients found in dietary supplements is how your body 
absorbs and uses them. This activity is known as bioavailability: the rate at 
which a substance is absorbed and made available to your body. Nutrients 
are broken down in the stomach and passed into the small intestine, where 
they’re absorbed and then metabolized by the liver or kidneys. From there, 
the nutrients are delivered to different parts of your body. It’s a long journey, 
and the body has plenty of opportunities to alter the way the supplements 
end up being used.
Studies have shown that many dietary supplements aren’t absorbed as well 
as the nutrients in the foods you eat (although, as with every rule, there are 
exceptions — folic acid, for example, is actually better absorbed than its natu-
ral form, folate). Because of the difference in absorption rates, you may have 
to take six or even a dozen capsules a day to get the same amount of nutrients 
you’d get from eating a healthy diet. (And that’s assuming your body absorbs 
all the nutrients in the capsules, which doesn’t usually happen.)
Nutrition + Pharmaceutical = Neutraceutical
Dr. Stephen L. DeFelice coined the term neutra-
ceutical to refer to foods or dietary supplements 
that have health and medical benefits and may 
prevent or actually treat disease. According 
to Dr. DeFelice, an orange is a neutraceutical 
because it contains enough vitamin C to treat 
scurvy. Of course, a vitamin C tablet would also 
treat scurvy and would fit this definition as well.

 Chapter 3: Supplementing Superfoods
How much of what do I need and when?
The Food and Nutrition Board of the National 
Academy of Sciences created the Recommended 
Daily Allowances (RDA) of certain nutrients in 
1941 for the purpose of evaluating nutritional 
intakes of large populations of people. This 
information was used to prevent nutritional 
deficiencies by establishing guidelines for nutri-
tional labeling and for setting standards for food 
assistance programs. The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) established the US RDA for 
protein, vitamins, and some minerals in 1973. The 
US RDA had only one value for each nutrient and 
didn’t differentiate for gender or age.
The RDAs were useful for large groups of 
people, but they weren’t intended to be used 
for the assessment of any one person’s diet. 
So, in the 1990s, the board created the Dietary 
Reference Intakes (DRIs). The DRIs include four 
different nutritional measurements and can be 
used to create meal plans and diets for an indi-
vidual. The four measurements are
 ✓ RDAs: Were slightly redefined
 ✓ Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): 
Represents the amount of a nutrient that 
meets the needs of half of the population 
and is based on strong scientific evidence
 ✓ Adequate Intake (AI): Similar to the EAR 
but is more of an estimate for nutrients that 
don’t have quite as much research available
 ✓ Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): The 
highest amount of a nutrient that can be 
safely consumed on a daily basis
Even though the US RDAs aren’t used any-
more, those values became the basis for the 
Daily Values you see on current Nutrition Facts 
labels and don’t always correlate with the 
DRIs. Although the food labels serve as a ter-
rific guide, it’s important to know that any one 
individual’s nutritional needs may vary.
Most manufacturers attempt to make capsules and pills so that they dissolve 
in the right spots, therefore maximizing absorption and improving bioavail-
ability. Still, many pills and capsules have low bioavailability (which is one 
reason that getting your nutrition from food is often a better option).
Supplements are most useful when they provide the same nutritional value 
as a large quantity of food — especially when it’s virtually impossible for you 
to eat that much of a particular food or food group on a regular basis. That’s 
why fiber supplements are so popular; because foods that have a lot of fiber 
are quite filling, many people find it impossible to get their recommended 
daily intake through diet alone.
Getting the nutrients you need
How do you know how much of each nutrient you need? The Food and Nutrition 
Board of the Institute of Medicine determined dietary reference intakes (DRIs) 
for all the vitamins and minerals for the average person. Dietary supplements are 
intended to add any nutrients that your body may be lacking. The chart in Table 

44
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
3-1 shows DRIs for vitamins and minerals, particular foods you’d need to eat to 
get your DRI (note that in many cases superfoods fill the bill!), and whether sup-
plements for that particular nutrient may be a good idea for the average person.
 
The supplement recommendations in Table 3-1 are for the average person 
with no medical or lifestyle considerations that may warrant additional 
supplements. See the section “Determining Whether You Need Supplements,” 
later in this chapter, for more info.

Heeding a few precautions
For the most part, dietary supplements are very safe. However, taking large 
doses of dietary supplements without medical guidance isn’t a good idea. 
Believe it or not, it’s possible to overdose on vitamins and minerals. Table 3-2 
shows how taking too much of certain nutrients can harm your health.

In addition, some dietary supplement companies make false or misleading 
claims for their products. Remember, dietary supplements are only loosely 
regulated, and the claims they make aren’t evaluated by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) or any other agency. Dietary supplements do not have 
to be tested to prove they are beneficial or safe before they’re sold.
Here are some things to be wary of when you’re shopping for supplements:
 
✓ Outlandish claims: Be alert to over-the-top claims you see in advertise-
ments or on labels. Phrases like “miracle cure,” “medical breakthrough,” 
or “newest discovery” should raise red flags for you and encourage you 
to do more research before you buy. You can (and should) ask your 
doctor about any supplements you’re thinking of taking.
 
✓ Poor manufacturing: Remember that the supplement industry is not 
tightly regulated, so to avoid poor manufacturing, look for nationally 
known brands with label statements about testing and certification. If 
you’re not sure whether a supplement is tested and certified, call the 
company and ask for a certificate of analysis showing that they have 
properly formulated the supplement. See the later section “Knowing 
What to Look For” for info on researching products and manufacturers.
 
✓ Unstated health interactions: Many labels don’t warn you of potential 
health risks or interactions with other supplements or medications. 
That’s why you should always consult your doctor before you begin 
taking any supplements.
 
 Consulting your doctor before taking any supplements is particularly 
important if you’re about to undergo any medical procedures, because 
some nutrients can affect bleeding and how your body reacts to anes-
thesia. To be safe, bring your supplements with you so your doctor can 
read the labels and identify any potential concerns.

47
 Chapter 3: Supplementing Superfoods
Determining Whether You 
Need Supplements
It’s amazing how easy it is to be convinced to take an herb or vitamin based 
on a recommendation from a friend, colleague, or your doctor. After all, 
everyone wants to feel better and remain healthier. If someone says that he 
or she takes 10,000 milligrams of vitamin C and feels capable of moving a 
mountain, it’s human nature to think, “Well, I should give it a try, too!”
The truth is that in some instances it makes sense to get additional nutrients 
through supplements. But in other cases, taking supplements can actually 
aggravate an existing health problem.
When supplements make sense
Some medical conditions and lifestyle factors can be alleviated by increasing 
your intake of certain nutrients. Here are some common situations that may 
call for higher-than-normal nutrient intake levels:
 
✓ Smoking: Smokers are thought to need an almost 50 percent higher intake 
of daily nutrients than non-smokers. Cigarettes (and even pipe and chewing 
tobacco) are loaded with chemicals that react badly with the body. These 
chemicals can cause inflammation and disease, but the effects can be miti-
gated by consuming higher doses of certain nutrients, like vitamin C.
 
✓ Disease: Several diseases can harm your body’s ability to absorb and use 
nutrients, so you may need supplements to counter these effects. For 
example, gastrointestinal ailments may decrease nutrient absorption, and 
you may need to take supplements intravenously (under a doctor’s super-
vision, of course). Inflammatory conditions may require more antioxi-
dants to help reduce swelling. Some nutrients (many of them found in the 
superfoods we cover throughout this book) can help slow the progress of 
cancer and other diseases as well as increase overall well- being.
 
✓ Medications: Certain medication classes can interfere with absorption 
of vitamins and minerals by disrupting either the transport or metabo-
lism of certain nutrients. Anti-seizure medications, oral contraceptives, 
anti-inflammatories, and chemotherapy drugs are among those known to 
interfere with nutrient absorption.
 
✓ Occupational exposures: People who are exposed to chemicals in their 
work environment often have higher rates of vitamin deficiency. Toxic 
levels of metals (see the “Seeing secrets held by hair” section later in 
this chapter) can cause deficiencies in both minerals and vitamins.

48
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
 
✓ Malnourishment: If you don’t eat enough fruits and vegetables or if your 
diet is high in trans fats, sugar, and other highly processed foods, you’ll 
probably need to take daily supplements until you get established on a 
proper diet. People with anorexia or bulimia also fall into this category.
 
 Vegetarians and vegans don’t necessarily fall into the malnourished cat-
egory, but they do have some special needs based on their food intake. If 
you don’t eat meat or any animal products, you may need to consider sup-
plementing your intake of vitamin B12, iron, calcium, vitamin D, and zinc.
 
✓ Alcohol or other drugs: Most drugs, including alcohol, cause a deple-
tion of important vitamins and minerals. Alcohol can cause irritation of 
the stomach, which effects nutrient absorption. In addition, the empty 
calories from alcohol often replace healthy food intake, which can make 
vitamin and mineral deficiencies worse.
 
✓ Age: You can use more of certain nutrients as you get older. Studies 
have shown that people over age 60 can use almost 30 percent more B6, 
and vitamin D and calcium also should be taken in higher quantities. As 
always, make sure you discuss supplements with your doctor before 
you start taking them.
 
✓ Pregnancy: This is an important time to get some extra nutrition. The 
female body shares nutrients with the fetus, so needing more than usual 
makes sense. Folate is particularly important for healthy fetus development.
 
Although supplements can provide moderate amounts of various nutrients, 
the best way for your body to utilize nutrients is through a balanced, healthy 
diet with superfood additions. This, along with a healthy lifestyle, keeps your 
body in the best position to remain disease free.
When supplements don’t make sense
Supplements can be beneficial, but they aren’t right for everybody all the time. 
Hard as it may be to believe, in some situations, supplements do more harm 
than good. Some vitamins, when taken in excess, can interfere with medica-
tions and can also cause some general symptoms of malaise (see Table 3-2, 
earlier in this chapter, for more details on the effects of overdosing).
 
If you take any medications, you should check with your doctor to make sure 
the supplements you plan to take won’t affect the potency or effect of your 
medications. Following are a few medical conditions that can be aggravated by 
dietary supplements:
 
✓ Cancer
 
✓ Diabetes

49
 Chapter 3: Supplementing Superfoods
 
✓ Heart disease
 
✓ Epilepsy or seizure disorder
 
✓ Enlarged prostate
 
✓ Thinning of the blood that could lead to bleeding of the gums or nose or 
blood in the stool
 
✓ Cardiovascular disease (including high blood pressure)
 
✓ Hormone imbalance
 
✓ Parkinson’s disease
Some dietary supplements can slow down or speed up metabolism of pre-
scription medications, so you should have your doctor review your supple-
ments to make sure there are no interactions. Here are some that warrant 
medical clearance before you take any supplements:
 
✓ Blood thinners
 
✓ Anti-seizure medications
 
✓ Blood pressure medications
 
✓ Diabetes medications
 
✓ Psychiatric medications (including antidepressants)
Testing for Your Supplement Needs
You can have your nutrient levels tested to see whether you need supple-
ments. Your doctor may be able to order blood or hair tests that can reveal 
deficiencies or excesses of certain nutrients or exposure to substances that 
may indicate the need for supplements.
 
The role of nutrients in health is well-established, but regular testing is still 
not common practice and insurance companies are slow to respond to the 
demands of consumers. Some insurance companies cover a portion or all of 
the costs for vitamin and mineral testing, but it depends on the company and 
selected plan, so check first.
 
Some symptoms, such as fatigue, weight gain or weight loss, headaches, and 
joint pain, may indicate a serious health problem. But they also could be 
caused by nutritional deficiencies or overabundance of certain nutrients. If 
your doctor doesn’t find any medical explanation for such symptoms, you 
may want to explore nutrition as a possible solution.

Doing blood analysis
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could have your blood drawn and end up with a 
printout of exactly what you need, don’t need, and have the right amount of? 
Fine-tuning nutritional needs with simple blood tests is a process that’s well 
underway. If your doctor suspects nutritional deficiencies based on your 
symptoms and medical history, blood tests can offer concrete data to help 
determine which dietary changes or supplements make sense.
Blood testing is one way to determine what your body needs — and what you 
may not be getting from your diet. Some blood tests give you a specific break-
down of nutrient levels, such as the amounts of vitamins, minerals, amino 
acids, and fatty acids your body contains. This direct testing helps identify 
deficiencies or abundances in your nutritional make-up.
Routine medical blood tests can indirectly reveal nutritional issues, even 
though they aren’t testing for any specific deficiencies. When regular blood 
tests show values that are out of normal ranges, doctors often look for vari-
ous diseases as the cause. But sometimes these same results can be caused 
not by disease, but by nutrient imbalances. Additional testing for specific 
vitamin and mineral levels can be very helpful — and may lead to much dif-
ferent treatment options.
This area of blood testing is growing because knowing how well your body 
is doing nutritionally can allow you to maximize diet and supplementation. If 
you aren’t a big fan of having your blood drawn, you can always seek other 
testing modalities, such as hair and saliva. Saliva testing is very reliable for 
evaluating hormones and is starting to be used for vitamins and minerals. 
This may become an important test option because it’s less invasive than 
other types of testing.
Nutritional testing labs
Several U.S. labs specialize in nutritional testing. 
Spectracell offers a variety of tests. They can 
assess the function and the deficiency of many 
vitamins, minerals, and amino acids; they also 
offer a test for antioxidant function and actually 
can test for a few specific antioxidants. Other 
labs like this exist, and your physician may be 
able to direct you to such reputable sites.
Direct Laboratory Services is one of numerous 
online labs that offer several different lab packages 
to assess vitamin levels, including imbalances 
and abundances, and give concise recommenda-
tions to restore healthy levels. Most online labs 
will send you kits that you can do at home; some 
require you to have blood drawn at your doctor’s 
office or local blood-drawing station.

51
 Chapter 3: Supplementing Superfoods
These tests are becoming a very important tool as doctors are finding how 
important the use of dietary and nutritional therapy can be. Testing can 
range from $100 to $1,000, depending on how much data you’re trying to 
collect. In the future, this type of testing may become a part of annual blood 
testing, but for now it’s not a bad investment to get some form of testing 
done, either yearly or when you’re not feeling well.
Seeing secrets held by hair
If you watch crime shows on television, such as CSI or Forensic Files, you 
know that your hair can reveal a lot about your body. Hair analysis is the 
Environmental Protection Agency’s test of choice for determining exposure 
to toxic metals and levels of trace minerals because the mineral content in 
your hair accurately reflects the amount of that mineral in your entire body. 
These days, hair is regularly tested to determine levels of minerals, metals, 
and other substances, including vitamins and even poisons.
Most chiropractors and homeopathic physicians offer hair testing or other 
similar tests, and more conventional doctors are discovering the benefits of 
hair testing. If your doctor doesn’t do this type of testing, he or she should be 
able to recommend a lab or clinic that does.
 
Hair analysis can differ from lab to lab, raising questions about the accuracy of 
the results. If you choose to have your hair tested to determine whether you 
need supplements, and if so, which ones, be sure to have the test done by a 
reputable lab.
Several body functions can be affected by heavy metals and minerals, includ-
ing hormone function, blood sugar control, and other metabolic pathways. 
Common metals that can interfere with metabolism, vitamin and mineral bal-
ances, and organ function at high levels include the following:
 
✓ Lead: High levels of lead can cause severe problems with nerve func-
tion, reproduction, and kidney function. Lead poisoning once was fairly 
common because of the prevalence of lead in paint, although that’s less 
of a concern today. Still, lead levels need to be monitored and consid-
ered in health evaluations. Furthermore, levels that were once consid-
ered safe are now often associated with symptoms of lead poisoning.
 
✓ Mercury: Mercury can accumulate in your body and cause problems 
with your liver, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system. The 
most common way to ingest potentially harmful levels of mercury is 
through eating fish from mercury-contaminated waters (see Chapter 7 
for more on mercury in fish).

52
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
 
✓ Aluminum: Dietary aluminum is very common, but mostly in such small 
quantities that it’s irrelevant. However, people who have kidney disease 
or other conditions that prevent their bodies from excreting aluminum 
can accumulate high levels of this metal and develop symptoms. Some 
of these symptoms mimic those of Alzheimer’s disease, such as memory 
loss and mental confusion.
 
 Some urban water supplies have higher amounts of aluminum; check 
with your local water company to see whether your water has high alu-
minum levels. Aluminum is also a common addition to antacids, so you 
should take them sparingly.
 
✓ Cadmium: This metal is mostly found in industrial work areas. It is 
highly toxic and has led to disease and death in welders. Some paints 
also contain cadmium.
Hair analysis is a good option, even if you’re feeling fine. If you discover 
imbalances in your nutrient levels before you have symptoms, you can adjust 
your diet (and perhaps use — or stop using — supplements) to correct them.
Considering Your Intake Options
There are some important differences in the way supplements are made and 
how they’re consumed. One of the main objectives of nutritional companies 
is to find the best ways to get nutrients into your cells. In the search for maxi-
mum absorption, manufacturers have begun to move away from pills and 
capsules in favor of other forms, such as liquids, dissolving tabs, and injec-
tions. Snack bars and healthy drinks also are great alternatives because they 
get you closer to real, whole foods. They’re a good choice when you’re on the 
go and just don’t have time for a traditional meal.
Taking tablets, capsules, or liquids
Most people assume that all supplements are created equal, but this is far 
from the truth. Manufacturing processes can affect how well your body 
absorbs the nutrients, and with the loose regulations currently in place, man-
ufacturers can easily produce supplements that give you little or no actual 
benefit. Turn to “Knowing What to Look For,” later in this chapter, for more 
on researching products and manufacturers. Here’s a quick look at some 
things to think about when you’re deciding whether to take supplemental 
tablets, capsules, or liquids:

53
 Chapter 3: Supplementing Superfoods
 
✓ Tablets are made by mixing organic or inorganic materials and then 
using machines to compress them into shape. Manufacturers use differ-
ent types of materials to hold the supplements together, and those mate-
rials can affect how efficiently your body absorbs the nutrients you’re 
after. Even the process used to compress the pills can affect absorption.
 
✓ Capsules are gelatin containers that commonly dissolve faster than tab-
lets. However, capsules often have significant amounts of filler material, 
and the kind of filler varies depending on the manufacturer. These fillers 
can affect absorption, too.
 
✓ Liquids generally claim to have better absorption rates than tablets or 
capsules. However, as with tablets and capsules, liquid supplements 
contain other substances that may inhibit the release of the actual nutri-
ent into your system. Taste is a factor, too; you’re unlikely to take a 
liquid supplement regularly if the taste makes you gag.
Different supplements come in different forms. For example, you may have a 
tablet of vitamin E and a capsule for fish oils. You may also have to consider 
the size of the tablet or capsule, because often people complain that supple-
ments are too big to swallow. Liquids are nice because there’s no problem 
with swallowing, and you often can dilute liquid supplements in water or 
other drinks to offset taste.
 
Reputable companies use the right materials and tested delivery methods to 
give you the best availability of the nutrient. Don’t spend too much time inves-
tigating the actual delivery form; instead, spend that time looking into the 
company making the supplement.
Superfood bars and drinks
Some great snack bars and drinks are available that are loaded with super-
foods and are definitely a decent alternative to more common supplements. 
Be careful, though; some of these products contain additives and calories 
that you won’t get in simple supplements.
Raw bars are functional foods in the shape of a convenient-to-eat snack bar. 
These bars tend to be loaded with superfoods, and they don’t have unhealthy 
additives like refined sugars or trans fats. Raw bars are made to be closest to 
eating a real meal and can be found with many super-duper superfoods (see 
Chapter 20).
 
Raw bars are available in several brands. Our favorites include Raw Revolution 
(www.rawindulgence.com) and Organic Pure (www.thepurebar.com).

54
Part I: Getting the Skinny on Superfoods 
If you aren’t a snack bar fan, how about a delicious superfood drink? Many 
healthy drinks use superfood berries like strawberries or acai berries, often 
with the addition of green tea. You can get these in ready-to-drink or -mix 
forms. Some superfood drinks even contain important greens like broccoli 
and spinach, as well as grasses and other vitamins.
 
We recommend Go Greens superfoods drink (www.togobrands.com), Dr. 
Schulze’s Super Food Plus (www.dr-schulze.com), and Vibe Neutraceutical 
Concentrate (www.eniva.com). If you can’t find these products or don’t want 
to order them online, V8 (the low-sodium variety) and V8 Fusion are good 
alternatives.
 
Like any other supplement, snack bars and drinks are no substitute for 
healthy meals. Use them to fill in the gaps between meals rather than to 
replace meals.
Knowing What to Look For
Once you’ve decided you want to supplement your diet, the sheer volume 
of supplement options and brands can be bewildering. Are store or generic 
brands as good as national brands? How can you be sure a given supplement 
is actually effective? What should you look for?
Here are some tips to make your search a little less daunting:
 
✓ Ask your doctor, family, and friends for recommendations. If people 
you trust are happy with the supplements they take or recommend, this 
is a good starting point for your own purchase.
 
✓ Ask your doctor if a quality generic or store brand is available. Your 
doctor may know of quality generic or store brands that are significantly 
cheaper than big-name brands but just as effective.
 
✓ Do some research online. The Internet makes it easy to find information 
about dietary supplements. Search by brand name, ingredient, or nutri-
ent, and be sure to evaluate both negative and positive information. A 
simple search of a manufacturer’s name can turn up review sites where 
consumers share their experiences with a particular product.
 
 You also can check out manufacturers at www.consumerlab.com. This 
site lists products that have been tested and certified, so you know that 
they contain the stated amounts of nutrients and that they’re safe.
 
 Online communities and blogs can also be great sources of informa-
tion on supplements, including reputable products. Check out 

55
 Chapter 3: Supplementing Superfoods
www.supplementinfo.org or www.ods.od.nih.gov, or type 
“dietary supplement blog,” or “healthy supplement blog” into your 
browser’s search engine.
 
✓ Look for food-base supplements. Food base is concentrated plant mate-
rial to which vitamins and minerals are added. Supplements with a food 
base contain enzymes and nutrients that boost absorption of the vita-
mins and minerals. This is probably the best type of supplement you can 
buy, but the tablets are larger, and you may have to take more of them.
 
✓ Check the expiration date. Supplements typically have a long shelf 
life — the length of time they can be stored and remain safe, effective, 
and usable — but you should always check the expiration date before 
you buy. There’s no point in buying 500 multivitamins that expire in six 
months.
 
Although many manufacturers claim that synthetic vitamins are chemically 
identical to the real thing, your body knows the difference between synthetic 
and natural vitamins. Numerous studies have shown that the human body 
uses natural vitamins more effectively and more efficiently than synthetic ver-
sions. This is another reason why supplements can only complement your 
diet; they can’t take the place of real foods — or superfoods.
Knowing Where to Look
Virtually every grocery store has a selection of vitamins and more popular 
dietary supplements on its shelves. But that doesn’t mean you’ll get the best 
product or the best price. Discount retailers like Wal-Mart and Target typi-
cally have a larger selection of supplements, including both national brands 
and their own store brands. And many cities large enough to have a mall also 
boast a health store of some sort.
 
No matter where you live, you can go online to order supplements from repu-
table manufacturers. Larger stores usually get volume discounts that can be 
passed on to the consumer, so you’re likely to find better prices at big-box 
stores. Online stores have less overhead, which can also lead to lower costs. 
One option is to research supplement manufacturers and prices online, and 
then check your local brick-and-mortar stores to see whether they offer simi-
lar or better prices. Two of our favorite sites are www.wholefoodsmarket.
com and www.organicstorelocator.com. You can order directly from the 
Whole Foods site; the second site directs you to organic and homeopathic 
stores near you, and some of these allow you to place orders online.

▶ Buying, storing, and serving superfood fruits
F
ruits and berries are sweet and delicious, so they’re very easy to incor-
porate into your healthy new superfoods diet. The word fruitful means 
“beneficial” and “abundant,” two words that make it easy to remember why 
you need fruits every day and how many you should eat.
Fruits and berries are beneficial for your health because they’re rich in nutri-
ents and fiber. They also have natural compounds called flavonoids that offer 
special health properties. Flavonoids are a specific form of phytochemicals 
found in the pigments that give fruits their colors. In nature, flavonoids and 
other phytochemicals protect the fruit; when you eat them, they protect you 
by working as antioxidants to prevent cell damage throughout your body — 
inside and out.
Fruits can also be an excellent source of fiber, providing a significant percent-
age of the recommended daily allowance. Most men need at least 38 grams of 
fiber a day, and most women need at least 25 grams.
How much fruit should you eat every day? Think “abundant,” as in a large 
amount. Experts recommend eating four servings (or 2 cups) of fruits every 
day, with a typical serving being one piece of fruit, 3/4 cup of fruit juice, or 1/2 
cup of chopped fruits or berries.
 
Not all your fruit servings need to be superfood fruits. While some fruits are 
better than others, we really can’t think of any fruits that are bad for your 
health.
All fruits are healthful, but some special fruits and berries are stars in the 
superfoods world. We recommend adding at least one superfood fruit to

your daily fruit intake. In this chapter, we explore the special health benefits 
of eight great fruits, and we tell you how to go about selecting, storing, and 
serving them.
 
Keep a bowl of fresh fruit on your kitchen counter where everyone can grab 
an apple, banana, or orange for a delicious and healthy treat.
Biting into the Amazing Apple
Does eating an apple a day really keep the doctor away? It actually might: 
Apples are low in calories and rich in nutrients and fiber.
Apples come in many varieties, so you can easily choose flavors and textures 
to suit your taste or cooking needs. The traditional, deep-hued Red Delicious 
apple is a perennial favorite, although many people prefer the flavor and 
texture of the newer varieties of sweet-tangy, crisp, bi-colored apples. Like 
something even more tart? Light green Granny Smith apples fill the bill and 
are great for cooking.
Put the health benefits of the amazing apple to work for you by adding this 
superfood fruit to your daily diet at least five times each week.
Appreciating the benefits of apples
The most potent flavonoid found in apples is quercetin, which is also a power-
ful antioxidant. Apples are an excellent source of fiber, too — one apple (with 
the skin) contains about five grams of fiber.
 
Much of the apple’s fiber and phytochemicals are found in the colorful exte-
rior, so get into the habit of eating both the flesh and the skin.
The nutrients, fiber, and flavonoids in apples work to keep you healthy in 
several ways. In fact, research shows several benefits of eating apples.
 
✓ They fight high blood pressure. According to The Journal of Nutrition in 
2007, quercetin helps to lower blood pressure in humans.
 
✓ They’re good for your lungs. The flavonoids work like antihistamines 
and anti-inflammatory agents to reduce the severity of asthma attacks 
and allergic symptoms. A 2001 study in The American Journal of 
Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine shows that people who eat five or 
more apples each week have a decreased risk of chronic lung disease.

61
 Chapter 4: Getting Fruitful and Reaping the Rewards
 
✓ They protect you from cancer. The journal Prostate reported in 2008 that, 
in laboratory tests, quercetin slows the growth of cancerous cells without 
harming prostate cells. The American Cancer Society suggests that eating 
a diet rich in fruits like apples may help to prevent a variety of cancers.
 
✓ They keep your mind sharp and clear. Older people who eat more 
apples and drink apple juice may have stronger brain function. 
According to The Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease in 2006, flavonoids help 
protect your brain from free-radical damage.
 
✓ They help you lose weight. Because apples are rich in fiber, they keep 
you feeling full longer so you’re less likely to snack on high-calorie snack 
foods. (An apple has only about 90 calories.) Their sweet, juicy flavor and 
crunchy texture make fresh apples a healthy dessert or afternoon snack.
 
✓ They help maintain a healthy digestive system and regulate choles-
terol levels. These benefits can also be credited to the high fiber con-
tent of apples.
 
✓ They help fight viral infections, like colds and flu, plus they keep con-
nective tissue healthy. One apple contains about 8 milligrams of vitamin 
C (about 8 percent of the daily requirement).
Choosing, storing, and using apples
Apples are easy to find in every grocery store and even in many convenience 
stores. Look for apples that have shiny, smooth skins free from blemishes 
and punctures. During the fall months, look for local orchards or festivals 
that offer super-fresh apples, apple juice, and homemade applesauce.
Most of the apples you buy in the store have been covered with a clear, 
edible wax that helps to protect them during shipping. The wax helps keep 
moisture in the apples so they stay fresh and crisp all the way from the 
orchard to your table. You don’t need to remove the wax, but you should still 
wash apples before eating them.
Which apples are best for what?
Some apples are best for eating and some are 
better for cooking. Here’s a short list of some of 
the common apples and their best uses:
 ✓ For eating: Red Delicious, Gala, and Fuji
 ✓ For baking: Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, 
and Rome
 ✓ For applesauce: Cortland, Macintosh, and 
Jonathan

Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
For convenience, you can keep a few apples in a fruit bowl on your kitchen 
counter. However, apples stay fresher longer in cool air, so it’s best to store 
them in the refrigerator in a paper bag that is loosely closed.
Apples give off a gas called ethylene that actually makes some fruits (such as 
bananas, pears, peaches, and plums) ripen faster. This same gas can cause 
damage to some vegetables such as leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, and 
cucumbers. Keep an apple with green bananas to make them ripen more 
quickly, but keep apples away from the vegetable bin in your fridge.
Apples are quite versatile. An apple makes a great snack on its own or with 
a handful of healthful nuts, or you can slice it and spread peanut butter on 
each slice. Serve Granny Smith slices with blue cheese or brie and a glass of 
red wine. If you’re looking for a delicious dessert, slice up a Granny Smith 
and top with a light drizzle of caramel sauce and some chopped pecans. 
During cooler weather, try some hot apple cider mulled with cinnamon and 
other spices to warm you up.
Peeling the Benefits of Bananas
Bananas are one of the most popular and least expensive fruits to add to 
your diet. As such, they’re an economical way to help meet your daily fruit 
and vegetable requirements.
More than just a naturally sweet snack and versatile ingredient, the banana 
is also a superfood — thanks to its nutrients, phytochemicals, and fiber. You 
need to eat at least 2 cups of fruits every day, and eating a large banana satis-
fies half of that daily need. We suggest you eat a banana two or three days 
each week.
One banana contains more than 450 milligrams of potassium, a mineral that’s 
important for keeping your body fluids in balance, which in turn keeps your 
blood pressure at healthy levels. Experts agree that everyone needs about 
4,700 milligrams of potassium every day. But bananas have many other ben-
efits, too. Read on!
Eating bananas for more 
than just potassium
Bananas protect your heart because they contain potassium and dietary 
fiber, and they’re low in sodium. However, bananas can do so much more. 
Eating bananas (along with other fruits and vegetables) is an important part 
of a healthful diet.

63
 Chapter 4: Getting Fruitful and Reaping the Rewards
Eating bananas provides you with potassium, vitamins B6 and C, plenty 
of fiber, and some magnesium, all of which are essential for good health. 
Bananas have the following in their favor:
 
✓ They lower your blood pressure. Bananas are not only high in potas-
sium, but also low in sodium, a combination that may reduce high blood 
pressure. This means your heart doesn’t have to work so hard to pump 
blood throughout your body.
 
✓ They’re high in vitamin B6. Your body needs B6 to produce red blood 
cells and to break down protein into components your body can use. 
Vitamin B6 also helps keep homocysteine levels in check. High homo-
cysteine levels correlate to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
 
✓ They have lots of dietary fiber. Studies confirm that people who eat 
diets high in fiber have lower rates of cardiovascular disease. Fiber is 
also important for keeping the digestive tract healthy by keeping bowel 
movements regular.
 
✓ They’re rich in fructooligosaccharide (FOS), a natural substance that 
feeds the friendly bacteria that live in the colon. These beneficial 
bacteria produce vitamins, enzymes, and other organic acids that help 
protect you from unfriendly bacteria. Bananas also contain a compound 
that combats the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers and works as a 
natural antacid.
 
✓ They may help protect you from cancer. A diet rich in fruits and vegeta-
bles has been associated with a reduced risk of several types of cancers, 
including a kidney cancer called renal cell carcinoma. Of all the fruits 
and vegetables studied, the International Journal of Cancer reported in 
2005 that bananas have the strongest association for prevention of this 
disease. Bananas also contain plant lectins, proteins that survive diges-
tion intact. Lectins are very biologically active and may fight cancer by 
killing cancerous cells and inhibiting tumor growth.
 
✓ They may help protect your bones. Bananas may help reduce calcium 
loss through the urine and improve your body’s ability to absorb nutri-
ents, including calcium and other minerals needed for strong bones.
Adding bananas to your superfoods diet
You can find bananas in the produce department of every grocery store and 
even on the shelves in many convenience stores. They’re easy to store, easy 
to prepare, and easy to eat.
 
When bananas reach your grocery store, they may be more of a greenish tint 
and not fully ripe. That’s okay; just take your bananas home and let them 
ripen on the counter at room temperature.

64
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
 
Cold slows down the ripening process, so don’t put your bananas in the refrig-
erator until they are fully ripened, with yellow skin and brown spots.
The banana is a very versatile fruit. The simplest way to enjoy a banana is to 
simply peel one and eat it. Bananas are naturally sweet and don’t need any-
thing to dress them up. You can also slice a banana and add it to a bowl of 
oatmeal to double up on superfoods (see Chapter 8 for more about oatmeal).
You can even use bananas to top off a hot fudge sundae or a banana split, or 
make Bananas Foster (a dessert made with bananas, vanilla ice cream, and a 
sauce that includes butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and dark rum). These treats 
are high in fat and calories, but it’s okay to treat yourself occasionally. Really.
Bananas can also be used as an ingredient: You can add them to fruit salad 
or, when they get fully ripe, you can use them to make banana breads or 
muffins. Bananas also are the secret ingredient for making fruit smoothies. 
For richer and thicker smoothies, cut ripe bananas into one-inch chunks and 
freeze them. When it’s time to make your smoothies, just pop four or five 
chunks into the blender with your other ingredients.
Picking Beautiful Blueberries
Blueberries burst with flavor and good health. They even came out on top for 
antioxidant activity when more than 40 commercially available fruits were tested. 
The dark blue pigment found in blueberries contains phenols called anthocyanins 
(flavonoids with powerful antioxidant capabilities). Consequently, they have many 
health benefits, so try to enjoy 3 or 4 cups of blueberries every week.
Tapping into the antioxidant 
power of blueberries
Blueberries are a significant source of vitamin C, manganese (an essential 
trace mineral important for many chemical reactions in your body), and 
fiber. Plus, like many superfood fruits, they’re low in calories.
One cup of blueberries contains 14 milligrams of vitamin C, half a milligram of 
manganese, 4 grams of fiber, and only 84 calories. Blueberries help your body 
in several ways:
 
✓ They keep your heart healthy. The anthocyanins keep your blood ves-
sels strong. According to the United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA), the darker pigments in blueberries may lower cholesterol.
 
✓ They help prevent cancer. According to research published in 2008 in The 
Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, antioxidants in blueberries 

65
 Chapter 4: Getting Fruitful and Reaping the Rewards
may help to prevent colon cancer and ovarian cancer by promoting anti-
cancer activity in your cells.
 
✓ They keep your vision clear. Blueberries contain natural compounds 
related to vitamin A called lutein that promote healthy night vision and 
prevent macular degeneration (an age-related eye disease that’s the 
leading cause of vision loss in the elderly). The Age-Related Eye Disease 
Study conducted by the National Eye Institute in 2001 confirmed the 
effectiveness of lutein and other antioxidants.
 
✓ They keep your mind sharp. According to the Agency for Health Care Policy 
and Research, a substance in blueberries (as well as other berries) may help 
to protect you from some of the deleterious effects of Alzheimer’s disease.
 
✓ They prevent urinary tract infections. The natural compounds in 
blueberries prevent bacteria from sticking to the walls of your bladder, 
which prevents urinary tract infections.
Purchasing, packing away, 
and preparing blueberries
Blueberries are usually easy to find in both the produce and freezer sections 
at your grocery store. Blueberries freeze very well, and they’re good for you 
whether fresh or frozen.
 
During the summer months, you may be able to buy big, beautiful blueberries 
at farmers’ markets, or you may find farms where you can pick your own.
Selecting blueberries is easy. Look for berries that are deep blue with little 
to no trace of green coloring; unlike many fruits, blueberries don’t continue 
to ripen after they’re picked. Healthy blueberries should be firm with a slight 
shimmer to the skin, and there should be no sign of mold.
Keep blueberries in your refrigerator. Don’t wash them until you want to use 
them, because moisture hastens deterioration. Blueberries are delicate and 
quite perishable, so eat them within a few days or freeze them.
Blueberries freeze very well when you put them in sturdy plastic containers. 
Again, don’t wash the berries before you freeze them because the water on 
the skins will make them tough. Instead, rinse the berries after they thaw.
Whether fresh or frozen, you can easily incorporate blueberries into your 
superfoods diet. Traditional uses of blueberries include baked goods such as 
pancakes and muffins because blueberries hold up well to heat.
 
If you buy premade baked goods, be sure they contain real blueberries, not the 
little blueberry-flavored sugar blobs commonly found in cheap baked goods.

66
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Sprinkle some berries on your whole-grain cereal or oatmeal in the morning, 
or enjoy a bowl of blueberries with a little milk or cream and a few walnuts 
for breakfast.
Thawed berries can be used just like fresh ones. You can even add frozen 
blueberries and banana chunks, along with pomegranate or other juice, to 
your blender to make a tasty fruit smoothie.
Picking Cherries: The Dessert Topper
Cherries are another red-to-yellow superfood fruit rich in phytochemicals 
and nutrients. They’re best known as the main ingredient in cherry pies and 
cobblers; however, they make a healthy and sweet treat when eaten alone.
There are two types of cherries: sweet and tart. Sweet cherries are delicious 
when eaten plain, while tart cherries are more likely to be used in baking or 
cooking. Tart cherries are usually processed right after harvesting, but you 
can find fresh sweet cherries in your local grocery store. We suggest you 
enjoy cherries at least twice a week.
Packing melatonin and phytochemicals
Cherries contain a hormone called melatonin, which is best known as a 
sleep inducer, but melatonin may also help to fight cancer and depression. 
Melatonin may work well in combination with the phytochemicals that are 
found in cherries. Additionally, cherries contain quercetin, a flavonoid best 
known as a natural antihistamine and anti-inflammatory agent.
Nutritionally, cherries are low in calories while providing substantial 
amounts of potassium (300 milligrams per cup), vitamin C (10 milligrams per 
cup), and fiber (4 grams per cup).
Eating cherries brings all sorts of health benefits, including the following:
 
✓ Cherries are good for your heart. Almost all superfoods are good for 
your heart, and cherries are no exception. The combination of phy-
tochemicals and potassium helps keep your blood pressure regular, pro-
tect your body’s good cholesterol, and keep your arteries healthy.
 
✓ Cherries may help keep your brain healthy. According to The Journal 
of Agricultural and Food Chemistry in 2005, the various phytochemicals 
found in cherries may have a beneficial effect on nerve cells, which may 
reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
 
✓ Cherries reduce your risk of cancer. The cherry’s coloring contains 
compounds that have been shown to have anti-cancer activity in the lab. 

67
 Chapter 4: Getting Fruitful and Reaping the Rewards
In 2004, the journal Carcinogenesis reported that cyanidins, which are anti-
oxidants found in cherries, may help reduce the growth of cancer cells.
 
✓ Cherries may help to relieve pain. Many people suffer from pain and 
inflammation, and some of the superfoods may help alleviate that suffering. 
Cherries in particular contain many phytochemicals similar to those found 
in strawberries that act as anti-inflammatories — using the same mecha-
nism painkillers like ibuprofen use, but without the adverse side effects.
 
✓ Cherries may help you sleep. Melatonin is the sleep hormone that your 
body naturally secretes in larger amounts at night. Eating cherries may 
help you to regulate your sleep, may reduce the effects of jet lag, and 
may be valuable for people who work night shifts and need to sleep 
during the day. Cherry extract is often used in natural, over-the-counter, 
sleep-aid supplements.
Culling, keeping, and enjoying cherries
You can find fresh cherries in the produce section of your grocery store. 
Choose cherries that are firm and plump, with healthy, shiny skins and green 
stems. Avoid cherries that have soft spots and discolorations. You can also 
find frozen, dried, or canned cherries, but watch out for added sugar.
Keep cherries in the refrigerator; warm temperatures cause them to spoil 
quickly. Only buy the amount of cherries you think you will eat within a week.
 
If you have more cherries than you can eat in a few days, you can freeze them. 
Simply rinse them and put them in sturdy plastic containers. When you’re 
ready to serve your cherries, let them thaw partially for a nicer texture. You 
may also wish to remove the pits before freezing for easier serving later.
Cherries make a nice addition to garden salads and fruit salads. Simply rinse 
the cherries and remove the stems and pits. Cherries combine very well with 
almond flavorings.
Cherries are also available in a dried form that makes them very portable and 
easy to use. You can make your own trail mix by combining dried cherries, 
raisins, almonds, pecans, and your favorite whole-grain cereal.
Paying Homage to the Native Cranberry
Cranberries are very tart little red berries. They’re related to blueberries, 
so they have many of the same properties. This berry is native to North 
America and was first discovered by Europeans in 1550. The Pilgrims used 
cranberries, and cranberry sauce is traditionally served in the United States 
at Thanksgiving alongside the turkey and stuffing. We think cranberries are 

68
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
great; however, their tartness makes them difficult to enjoy without adding 
extra sugar. Cranberry juice can be blended with other, sweeter juices, and 
cranberry extract is available as a dietary supplement. We suggest you eat 
cranberries or drink cranberry juice twice each week.
Blocking bacteria
Cranberries contain phytochemicals that help block bacterial growth, espe-
cially in the urinary tract. Cranberry juice has been a home remedy for pre-
vention of bladder infections for many years.
One cup of cranberries also contains 13 milligrams of vitamin C that help 
keep your immune system and blood vessels strong. Cranberries are very 
low in calories with no fat and little natural sugar. Cranberries have other 
benefits, too.
 
✓ They keep your heart healthy. The phenols in cranberries help keep 
your arteries clear. According to The British Journal of Nutrition in 2008, 
cranberry juice may reduce the levels of LDL cholesterol, blood fats that 
may increase your risk of cardiovascular disease.
 
✓ They treat and prevent bladder infections. Bladder infections (also 
called cystitis) usually require antibiotic therapy; however, cranberries 
can speed the healing time and prevent future infections. Hippuric acid, a 
compound found in cranberries, keeps urine acidic and prevents bacte-
ria from sticking to the walls of your bladder, so the bacteria can’t catch 
on and proliferate.
 
✓ They promote a healthy digestive tract. Some of the phytochemicals 
found in cranberries fight off food-borne pathogens and may help keep 
you from getting sick at a picnic when someone leaves the potato salad 
out too long.
 
✓ They fight cavities. Cranberries’ antibacterial properties extend to your 
mouth and may help to kill the bacteria that lead to tooth decay.
Buying, saving, and sweetening 
cranberries
Cranberries are available in fresh, dried, and canned form (the latter often has 
added sugar). Look for bags of fresh cranberries in the produce section of your 
local grocery store. They’re available year-round and are especially popular in the 
autumn months. If they’re on sale, buy an extra bag or two to pop into the freezer.
You can keep fresh cranberries in the refrigerator for a few days or in the 
freezer for two months if you use the bag you bought them in, which is 

69
 Chapter 4: Getting Fruitful and Reaping the Rewards
vented, or up to one year if you use freezer bags. Keep dried cranberries in 
airtight containers. You can store cooked cranberries in the refrigerator for 
up to one month.
Unless you have a very strong taste for tart flavors, you probably won’t be 
able to eat cranberries or drink the juice without the addition of sweeter 
flavors. For example, if you want to use cranberry juice to help prevent recur-
rent bladder infections, you can blend the cranberry juice with sweeter juices 
or with sparkling water. Drink at least 7 ounces of cranberry juice every day.
 
Be sure to buy 100 percent cranberry juice. Cranberry juice “cocktail” may not 
contain enough cranberry juice to be therapeutic.
You can make a simple cranberry sauce by combining a 12-ounce bag of 
cranberries with 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of orange juice in a saucepan over 
medium heat for about 10 minutes, until the cranberries start to pop. We 
know that’s a lot of sugar, so you may want to use 1 cup of sucralose instead.
Cranberries are often sold in dried form (like little red raisins) with a little 
sugar coating. You can use dried cranberries as a topping for salads, enjoy 
them as a snack alone, or mix them with other dried fruits and nuts.
Opting for Oranges
Sweet and juicy oranges are so popular that there’s a color named for them. 
They’re well-known for their vitamin C content, their beautiful color comes from 
many different beneficial phytochemicals, and the pulp contains lots of fiber.
Whether sliced or juiced, oranges can be a delicious part of your healthy 
superfoods diet. Calcium-fortified orange juice is also available as a healthy 
substitute for people who choose not to consume dairy products (and thus 
may not get enough calcium in their diets). We suggest you eat oranges at 
least five times each week.
Keeping healthy with vitamin C, 
folate, and phytochemicals
When you feel a cold coming on, do you run to the grocery store to stock up 
on orange juice? You should, because oranges are a great source of vitamin 
C — in fact, one orange contains 100 milligrams of vitamin C — well over 100 
percent of the vitamin C you need for an entire day.
Oranges contain many phytochemicals, such as flavonoids and polyphenols 
(natural chemicals found in plants), that act like antioxidants to protect your 

70
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
body inside and out. The Journal of the American College of Nutrition reported 
in 2003 that drinking orange juice every day provides effective antioxidant 
protection.
Oranges also contain potassium, folate, and fiber, which keep your heart 
healthy. One medium orange has around 80 calories and 4 grams of fiber.
The benefits of oranges are truly impressive — especially when you see all 
the ways they help keep you healthy.
 
✓ Oranges enhance your immune system. Your body needs vitamin C 
for many processes, including a properly functioning immune system. 
And a healthy immune system is crucial for fighting off cold and flu 
viruses. But don’t wait until you get sick to start eating oranges. Give 
your immune system a head start in fighting off viruses and infections by 
eating oranges year-round.
 
 Vitamin C alone — in the form of supplements, for example — doesn’t 
appear to work as well as eating oranges. Unlike supplements, oranges 
have those phytochemicals that may work with the vitamin C to keep 
you healthy.
 
✓ Oranges keep your skin smooth. Your skin is attached to your body by 
connective tissue. Eating oranges provides vitamin C that helps to keep 
the connective tissue strong, which in turn helps to keep your skin look-
ing younger.
 
✓ Oranges prevent rheumatoid arthritis. In 2003, The American Journal of 
Epidemiology published a study showing that women who ate the most 
oranges were at the lowest risk for rheumatoid arthritis.
 
✓ Oranges may help to prevent certain cancers. Oranges help protect 
you against lung cancer, and a study reported in 2008 in the journal 
Nutrition and Cancer reported that smokers who eat oranges are less likely 
to develop cancer of the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth 
and stomach). Once again, the phytochemicals in oranges are to thank.
 
✓ Oranges can protect unborn babies from spina bifida. Oranges contain 
folate, a water-soluble B vitamin that prevents a defect from forming in 
an embryo that causes spina bifida, a potentially crippling spinal condi-
tion in which the spinal cord isn’t properly enclosed.
 
✓ Oranges help keep homocysteine levels low. Homocysteine is an amino 
acid in your blood; high homocysteine levels have been linked to heart 
and vascular disease. The folate in oranges helps to lower homocysteine.
 
✓ Oranges protect you from strokes. Research published in The Journal of 
the American Medical Association in 1999 found that people who drank 
citrus juice such as orange juice every day had a lower risk of stroke.
 
✓ Oranges prevent anemia. Vitamin C makes it easier for your body to 
absorb iron from plant-based foods such as legumes, seeds, and veg-
etables and from dietary supplements.

71
 Chapter 4: Getting Fruitful and Reaping the Rewards
Enjoying the ease of oranges
Select oranges that have smooth skin, but don’t worry about a few blemishes. 
Ripe oranges feel a little heavier than those that are less ripe. You can find 
oranges in your local grocery store. Valencia oranges are best for juicing; 
navel oranges are easy to peel and eat. The more exotic mora orange, or 
blood orange, is just as good for you, with a slightly different flavor.
 
Navel oranges have a little “belly button” on one end. The larger the navel, the 
sweeter the orange will be.
Orange juice is available with or without pulp. Just be sure you’re buying 
100 percent orange juice and not orange-flavored beverages that have added 
sugar and less nutritional value. Freshly squeezed orange juice has more vita-
min C than the orange juice you buy at the grocery store, but even one serv-
ing of store-bought orange juice has all the vitamin C you need for one day.
Oranges can be stored in the refrigerator or on your counter; it just depends 
on whether you like to eat them cold or at room temperature. Orange juice 
should always be refrigerated.
Preparing an orange is easy. First, wash the skin so that you remove any dirt 
or bugs that may contaminate the flesh. You can cut the orange in half and 
cut each half into two or three lengthwise slices, or you can peel the rind off 
and eat it section by section.
The Berry “Grenade”: The Pomegranate
Pomegranates have gone from something rather exotic to a staple in many grocery 
stores. They’re about the size and shape of a large orange, but have a smooth, 
reddish exterior. Rather plain looking on the outside, the real beauty of the pome-
granate is found inside — each pomegranate contains dozens of red arils (berry-
like seed casings) that resemble large garnet gemstones (see Figure 4-1).
Grenadine
Grenadine is a red syrup that colors and flavors 
many cocktails, from Shirley Temples to Tequila 
Sunrises. Real grenadine is made from pome-
granate, sugar, and water. Unfortunately, most 
of the grenadine you see in the mixers section 
of your grocery store is composed of high fruc-
tose corn syrup and artificial flavors, with no 
pomegranate at all.

72

Pomegranate arils are deliciously sweet with different degrees of tartness, 
depending on the variety. The juice is rich in antioxidants and vitamins, while 
the seeds are a good source of fiber.
You can buy pomegranate juice at the grocery store. We recommend drinking 
8 ounces of juice, three times a week.
Packing powerful polyphenols
Pomegranate juice is a good source of vitamin C, pantothenic acid (vitamin 
B5), potassium, and polyphenols that are similar to the tannins (another kind 
of plant polyphenols) found in wine and tea. Plus, you get a little bit of fiber if 
you eat the seeds inside the arils.
You don’t need to eat the arils, however, because most of the health benefits 
are found in the juice. Most research studies focus on the juice, and pome-
granate juice is quite a superfood.
 
✓ It keeps your heart healthy. The antioxidants lower your blood pres-
sure and help keep your arteries clear and healthy. According to the 
journal Clinical Nutrition in 2004, drinking pomegranate juice also helps 
to keep so-called “bad” cholesterol low.
 
✓ It protects against cancer. According to research published in 2006 in the 
journal Clinical Cancer Research, pomegranate juice has a beneficial effect on 
prostate specific antigen (PSA), one of the lab markers for prostate cancer.
 
✓ It may improve erectile dysfunction. A preliminary study reported in 
2007 in The International Journal of Impotence Research suggests that by 
promoting healthy arteries, pomegranate juice may improve blood-flow 
to the penis, thereby improving sexual function.

73
 Chapter 4: Getting Fruitful and Reaping the Rewards
Fixing the fruit or buying the bottle
Pomegranates are easy to select because they are fully ripe when they arrive 
at the store. Look for fruits that aren’t cracked or split, and choose the ones 
that feel heaviest for their size.
So what do you do with a pomegranate when you get it home? You can store 
it at room temperature, uncut, for about one week, or you can keep it up to a 
month in the refrigerator. After you remove the arils from the pomegranate, 
you can keep the arils in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a few 
days or in the freezer for up to one year.
Preparing a pomegranate to harvest the juicy arils inside may seem a little 
daunting, but it really isn’t difficult if you follow these steps:
 
1. Cut off the crown end of the pomegranate.
 
2. Score the rind of the pomegranate into several sections, but don’t slice 
all the way through as you would an orange; you’ll damage the arils.
 
3. Place the pomegranate into a large bowl of water and break it into 
sections along the score lines.
 
4. Hold the sections under water and use your fingers to separate the 
arils from the white connective membrane.
 
 The arils will sink to the bottom of the bowl. The rind and membrane 
will float so you can easily scoop them off.
 
5. Drain the arils in a colander.
You can eat the arils as a snack or sprinkle them on top of oatmeal, pancakes, 
salads, and desserts.
 
If you prefer pomegranate juice, look for the words “100 percent pomegranate 
juice” on the label. Pure pomegranate juice is expensive. Beware of cheaper 
pomegranate juice drinks that contain lots of sugar or cheaper filler juices that 
dilute the actual amount of pomegranate juice.
 
If you find pomegranate to be a little too tart for your liking, mix it with 
sweeter juices such as blueberry, apple, or grape.
Savoring Sensational Strawberries
Strawberries land on the superfood list because of their terrific nutrition 
and powerful phytochemicals (plus a low calorie count). They’re also a good 
source of fiber. These beautiful red berries are the most popular member of 
the berry family.

74
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
You may be familiar with strawberries on shortcakes, in pies, or on top of ice 
cream sundaes, but they really don’t need the extra sugar. Strawberries are 
naturally sweet.
Because strawberries are so good for you and fairly inexpensive (compared 
to other fresh berries), we suggest you enjoy them three or four times 
a week.
Optimizing health with strawberries
Strawberries are a significant source of vitamin C and phytochemicals called 
phenols that help protect your health with their powerful antioxidant activ-
ity. The phenols in strawberries include anthocyanins and tannins, similar to 
the ones found in other berries.
Strawberries aren’t far behind oranges when it comes to vitamin C. One cup 
of strawberry slices gives you more than 100 percent of the vitamin C you 
need each day for fewer than 50 calories, so strawberries are an excellent 
food for watching your weight.
Among the health benefits of eating strawberries are the following:
 
✓ They keep your heart healthy. Strawberries provide heart-healthy 
potassium while being low in sodium. Strawberries also contain natural 
anti-inflammatory agents that may help keep your arteries healthy. The 
folate found in strawberries reduces homocysteine levels (high levels 
are associated with heart disease). Folate is particularly important for 
pregnant women, as it helps to prevent spina bifida in babies. (See the 
“Keeping healthy with vitamin C, folate, and phytochemicals” section 
earlier in this chapter.)
 
✓ They protect your vision. Eating three or more servings of fruit every 
day may help reduce your risk of macular degeneration (the leading 
cause of blindness in the elderly). The antioxidant lutein (found in straw-
berries and blueberries) may be particularly potent.
 
✓ They may help prevent cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. The phenols 
in strawberries have powerful anti-cancer properties. According to The 
Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry in 2008, berries of all kinds 
may help to prevent several types of cancers. The phenols in strawber-
ries may also prevent rheumatoid arthritis.
 
✓ They’re natural painkillers. In 2008, The Journal of Agricultural and Food 
Chemistry explained that phytochemicals in strawberries are powerful 

75
 Chapter 4: Getting Fruitful and Reaping the Rewards
anti-inflammatory agents that may work to reduce pain similar to the 
way ibuprofen and aspirin work — but without the side effects.
 
✓ They keep your immune system strong. Strawberries contain a lot of 
vitamin C, which strengthens your immune system. Vitamin C also keeps 
your connective tissue strong for younger-looking skin.
Selecting, storing, and 
savoring strawberries
These delicious, bright-red berries are available year-round in grocery stores. 
Look for fresh, plump strawberries in the produce section. Healthy berries 
should be a rich red in color and firm to the touch, with no sign of mold or 
spoilage.
Strawberries are also available in the frozen foods section. When you buy 
frozen strawberries, read the label to be sure the strawberries don’t have any 
added sugar.
Strawberries are easy to grow in your garden, or you can go to a farm that 
lets you pick your own strawberries. This is a fun family activity and a nice 
way to spend a beautiful summer morning.
At home, keep the berries in the refrigerator just as they are; wait until you’re 
ready to eat them before you wash them and cut off the stems. Strawberries 
are quite perishable, so only buy as many as you intend to eat over the 
course of about three days.
 
If you have more berries than you can eat in just a few days, you can freeze 
them by placing them in sturdy plastic containers just as they are. Freezing 
strawberries reduces the vitamin C content by about one-third. However, 
the phytochemicals remain intact, so frozen strawberries are still good 
for you.
When you’re ready to use your strawberries, just rinse them under water and 
remove the stems. Strawberries taste delicious whole or sliced and served in 
a bowl with a little cream or mixed with whole-grain cereal. They also work 
well as an ingredient in fruit smoothies. You can make yogurt fruit parfaits by 
layering yogurt, strawberries, blueberries, and crunchy nuts or granola in tall 
dessert glasses. Higher-calorie treats include using strawberries as a topping 
on ice cream and strawberry shortcake.

76
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Another way to use strawberries is to make a simple fruit salad by combining 
strawberry slices, blueberries, melon chunks, grapes, and pineapple pieces. 
Strawberries can also be added to a regular garden salad.
For a deliciously decadent (but healthy) superfood treat, try a large straw-
berry dipped in dark chocolate (see Chapter 9 for more on dark chocolate).
 
Watch out for strawberry toppings that are mostly sugar or syrup with very 
few strawberries. Use freshly sliced strawberries to top your desserts.

▶ Unlocking the health benefits of the superfood vegetables
▶ Choosing superfood vegetables
▶ Preparing superfood vegetables
W
hen you eat a superfoods diet rich in vegetables, you give your body 
what it needs to stay healthy. Eating lots of vegetables helps to prevent 
cancer, controls blood pressure, makes weight control much easier, and even 
keeps your brain healthy. The journal Neurology reported in 2006 that diets with 
lots of vegetables are associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in the 
elderly. You should eat at least four servings of vegetables every day.
Are all vegetables good for your health? Absolutely. Some vegetables, such 
as potatoes and sweet corn, have gotten a bad reputation with the popular-
ity of low-carbohydrate diets, but they really are healthful vegetables when 
you prepare them in healthful ways. A baked potato with the skin intact is 
good for you, for example, but French fries aren’t. Other healthful vegetables 
include beans, peas, squash, cauliflower, radishes, and greens. These vegeta-
bles are all nutrient-dense, which means they have a lot of nutritional value 
without a lot of calories. So eating lots of vegetables helps keep you slim.
While all vegetables are good for you, some have added benefits from phy-
tochemicals (natural compounds found in plants that can improve health and 
prevent disease) and high concentrations of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. 
The ones that have these additional benefits are our superfood vegetables.
Superfood vegetables are richly colored with red, orange, and green hues. 
The pigments contain phytochemicals called flavonoids (powerful antioxi-
dants that fight cell damage in your body).
 
Choose vegetables of different colors every day to get a variety of phytochemi-
cals that will affect different parts of your body. Dark green and brightly col-
ored vegetables are your best choices.

78
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
As this chapter explains, superfood vegetables are easy to incorporate into your 
diet as snacks, side dishes, soups, and salads. Plus, they’re easy to find in your 
local grocery stores; they store well; and, most important, they taste delicious.
Dipping into Holy Guacamole: 
The Avocado
Avocados, like tomatoes, are technically a fruit, but they’re usually used in cook-
ing as a vegetable. Avocados have a rough, thick, dark skin that has earned them 
the nickname “alligator pear.” But don’t let the tough skin fool you — the flesh 
inside is smooth, soft, and flavorful due to the avocado’s fat content. Avocados 
are rich in monounsaturated fats that help keep your heart healthy.
Avocados are rich in healthy oils and fiber, so we suggest you eat at least one 
avocado each week.
Making the most of monounsaturated fats
One ounce of avocado (about 2 tablespoons) contains 50 calories and 2 
grams of fiber, plus significant amounts of magnesium, potassium, folate, vita-
min K, and lutein — quite a lot of nutrition for such a small amount of food.
 
Avocados have more calories than most vegetables, so you need to watch 
your serving sizes. One serving of avocado is only about 2 tablespoons.
Avocados help to keep your heart healthy, reduce the symptoms of an 
enlarged prostate, and increase your absorption of vitamins A, E, and K.
 
✓ Protecting your heart: Avocados contain oleic acid, a heart-healthy 
monounsaturated fat recommended by the American Heart Association. 
Oleic acid protects your cardiovascular system by reducing your total 
cholesterol (elevated levels of cholesterol are linked to an increased risk 
of heart disease) and increasing your HDL cholesterol (the good kind — 
higher levels of HDL help to protect your heart).
 
 Avocados are also a good source of a plant sterol called beta-sitosterol. 
Sterols are a component of cell membranes in plants, and play a role 
similar to that of cholesterol in animal cells. Plant sterols are well-known 
for their ability to lower cholesterol in humans.
 
 The combination of oleic acid, plant sterols, folate, and fiber makes for 
powerful protection from heart disease.
 
✓ Reducing prostate symptoms: Avocados are rich in beta-sitosterol. The 
British Journal of Urology reported in 2000 that men who were treated 

79
 Chapter 5: Vegging Out in a Good Way
with beta-sitosterol had reduced urinary symptoms due to benign pro-
static hyperplasia, or enlarged prostates. Follow-up studies found that 
beta-sitosterol therapy was still effective after 18 months.
 
✓ Increasing absorption of fat-soluble vitamins: Eating fat along with 
foods containing vitamins A, E, and K helps improve the absorption of 
those vitamins. Adding a little avocado to a garden salad is a great way 
to boost vitamin absorption while adding extra nutrition.
Adding avocado to your diet
Fresh avocados are found in the produce section of the grocery store. You 
can’t tell much about an avocado by its tough exterior, but you can tell 
whether it’s ripe by gently squeezing. A ripe avocado will yield just slightly to 
your touch. If it’s too soft, you won’t be able to slice it, but you can still mash 
it for use in guacamole or other recipes.
Avocados that are firm to the touch can be ripened at home. Place them in a 
brown paper bag and keep them at room temperature for up to five days.
 
Your avocados will ripen faster if you place an apple in the bag. Apples give off 
ethylene gas that ripens fruits and some vegetables.
Once your avocados are ripe, you can keep them in the refrigerator for two 
or three days. They don’t keep well, so don’t buy more avocados than you 
can use in a couple days.
When you’re ready to use an avocado, wash it first to remove any dirt or bac-
teria. Cut the avocado lengthwise around the large seed. Twist the two halves 
in opposite directions to separate. Slide a spoon underneath the seed and lift 
it out. Place the halves cut side down, and peel away the skin. Slice or dice 
the flesh, and your avocado is ready to go.
You can enjoy avocados on sandwiches, in salads, or as guacamole — a deli-
cious dip made with avocados (see Chapter 19). Add small chunks of avo-
cado to burritos and tacos, too.
Feeling the Beet
Red beets are rich in nutrients and fiber and low in calories, with a deli-
ciously sweet flavor. Beets also contain antioxidants and other healthy phy-
tochemicals. Red beets are often passed over in favor of other, more popular 
vegetables. That’s a real shame, because they’re easy to prepare and so good 
for you. We suggest that you eat beets twice each week.

80
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Beating heart disease, birth defects, 
and metabolic syndrome
The red pigments in beets contain antioxidants called betalains that may 
help to reduce risk of heart disease and other chronic disease. According to 
research reported in 2005 in The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 
betalains protect your body from oxidative stress damage caused by free 
radicals (particles that occur as by-products from normal metabolism or from 
exposure to smoke, pollution, or too much sun).
Beets are also rich in a substance called betaine that reduces homocysteine 
levels (elevated homocysteine levels correlate with having a higher risk of 
cardiovascular disease). Betaine may also aid in digestion and improve your 
metabolism, the rate at which you burn calories.
Eating two cooked beets gives you 40 calories and 2 grams of fiber, plus mag-
nesium, potassium, and folate. Beets are also rich in plant sterols. When you 
eat beets, you reap the following benefits:
 
✓ They protect your heart. The combination of folate, fiber, betaine, and 
sterols helps to protect your heart by reducing homocysteine levels 
and keeping cholesterol levels in check. And, according to an article 
published in 2006 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, betalains 
prevent oxidative damage to blood cholesterol.
 
✓ They may prevent a birth defect. Beets are rich in folate. Mothers-to-be 
who are deficient in folate are more likely to give birth to babies born 
with spina bifida, a defect of the spinal cord and vertebrae.
 
✓ They fight metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a combination 
of obesity, elevated cholesterol, elevated glucose (blood sugar), and 
high blood pressure. People with metabolic syndrome have a high risk 
of cardiovascular disease. According to an article published in 2008 in 
The Journal of Nutrition, research subjects with metabolic syndrome had 
lower concentrations of betaine in their blood. Beets are rich in betaine.
Choosing and enjoying beets
Look for fresh beets in the produce section of your grocery store. They 
should be a deep red color with smooth skins. Choose small- to medium-
sized beets for the best flavor. Avoid beets that have damage to the skin, 
such as bruising or spots, and those that appear to be dry and shriveled. 
Store your beets in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
You can cook red beets and serve them as a side dish, or you can grate raw 
beets over salads and soups. To cook beets, first wash the skin gently. Then 
cut off the greens (you can use them as salad greens), but leave an inch or 

81
 Chapter 5: Vegging Out in a Good Way
two of the stem attached to the beets. Don’t peel the beets until after they’re 
cooked. Simply boil them until they’re tender when you pierce them with a fork.
 
When you roast vegetables in your oven, add some beets for variety, flavor, and 
color. You can also purchase heat-and-serve beets in cans or pickled in vinegar.
Eating large quantities of beets may result in pink or reddish-colored urine. 
Don’t be alarmed; this comes from the red pigments in beets and is harmless.
Betting on Broccoli: A Nutritional 
Powerhouse
Broccoli is a member of the cruciferous family (or mustard family) of vegeta-
bles that also includes cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, bok choy, and 
kale (another superfood vegetable). Cruciferous vegetables contain several 
types of natural compounds called glucosinolates, phytochemicals that have 
a positive impact on your health by reducing your risk of cancer. Broccoli 
is a superfood vegetable because it contains both glucosinolates and large 
amounts of other nutrients that are crucial for good health.
 
The dark green pigment of broccoli contains antioxidant phytochemicals 
along with several vitamins, such as vitamins A, K, and C.
Broccoli is such a nutritional powerhouse that we suggest you eat broccoli 
(either raw or cooked) four times each week.
Providing a wealth of health benefits
One cup of chopped broccoli gives you a full day’s supply of vitamin C, a 
water-soluble vitamin that your body can’t store and therefore needs to 
replace frequently. Vitamin C keeps your immune system strong so you 
can fight colds, flu, and infections, plus it protects your skin by keeping the 
underlying connective tissue strong. Broccoli also contains lots of vitamins A 
and K, two fat-soluble vitamins that are important for normal vision, healthy 
cell growth, and normal blood clotting.
Eating broccoli also provides you with calcium, potassium, and magnesium. 
These minerals keep your bones strong and are necessary for your muscles 
and nerves to work normally.
Finally, broccoli is a great source of fiber (1 cup contains 3 grams), which is 
good for your digestive system and cholesterol levels. And because 1 cup 
contains a mere 30 calories, you can eat large portions of broccoli with no 
negative impact on your weight.

82
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
And as if all these benefits weren’t enough, broccoli enhances your health in 
the following ways, too:
 
✓ Preventing cancer: Broccoli has been found to be effective in prevent-
ing several types of cancer, including prostate, bladder, colon, breast, 
and ovarian cancers. In fact, in 1994, The American Journal of Clinical 
Nutrition reported findings that broccoli was the best vegetable for pre-
venting colon cancer.
 
 According to the American Cancer Society, this anti-cancer action may 
be attributable to the fact that the phytochemicals in broccoli boost 
detoxifying enzymes. Researchers also believe that two important glu-
cosinolates found in broccoli — sulphorophane and indole-3-carbonyl — 
play a starring role. In particular, indole-3 carbonyl has been shown to 
prevent breast and ovarian cancers.
 
✓ Promoting clear vision as you age: Your eyes contain substantial 
amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin, two phytochemicals related to vitamin 
A that are also found in the dark green pigments of broccoli. Archives of 
Ophthalmology reported in 2007 that people who ate diets rich in lutein and 
zeaxanthin were less likely to suffer from macular degeneration.
 
✓ Maintaining cardiovascular health: The effect of lutein on the heart is 
similar to that of aspirin — without the side effects. The lutein in broccoli 
acts as an anti-inflammatory agent that reduces plaque in your blood ves-
sels, including the arteries that feed your heart. Plaque build-up leads to 
atherosclerosis (a narrowing of the arteries), reduces blood flow to vital 
organs, and increases your risk for heart attacks and strokes.
 
 The folate found in broccoli helps to keep homocysteine levels low (high 
levels are associated with heart disease), and potassium helps to keep 
blood pressure normal. As an added benefit, broccoli is low in sodium, 
an important consideration if you’re watching your blood pressure.
 
✓ Preventing a birth defect: The risk for spina bifida is higher when 
mothers-to-be don’t get enough folate in their diets, especially during 
the initial stages of pregnancy. Broccoli, along with other dark green 
vegetables, is a good source of folate.
Buying, storing, and preparing broccoli
Fresh broccoli is available in the produce department of every grocery store. 
Look for dark green, tightly packed florets (the darker the green tint, the more 
phytonutrients it contains). The stem should not be woody and the leaves 
should not be wilted. You can also buy frozen broccoli, either alone or combined 
with other vegetables. You can even find broccoli sprouts in some stores.
 
Some frozen broccoli products include seasonings or sauces. Some sauces are 
light and healthy, while others are high in calories and sodium, so be sure to 
read Nutrition Facts labels before you buy.

83
 Chapter 5: Vegging Out in a Good Way
Broccoli keeps well in the refrigerator. Store broccoli in the vegetable drawer 
and use it within a few days. Wash the broccoli just before you prepare it. Cut 
the florets off the stem and break into bite-sized pieces. Slice the stem into 
similar-sized chunks.
 
You can eat both the florets and the stem; however, the stems take longer to cook.
Broccoli can be steamed or boiled, but don’t overcook it: Florets only need 
about five minutes. The stems need another minute or two. Broccoli also 
works well in stir-fry dishes. Add stem pieces to hot oil and stir for one minute 
before adding the florets, and cook everything for another minute or so. 
Broccoli is done when it is crisp-tender and very bright green.
Serve crunchy raw broccoli pieces with veggie dip or salad dressing, or add 
them to garden salads and side dishes. See Chapters 17 and 18 for delicious 
and healthy broccoli recipes. Use broccoli sprouts in salads or on sand-
wiches, just as you would use alfalfa sprouts.
Cutting Heart Disease with Carrots
Carrots are delicious any time of the year. Bright orange carrots contain lots 
of vitamin A, which helps keep your vision healthy, and antioxidants plus 
phytonutrients that may help to prevent cancer. Carrots are high in fiber and 
low in calories, so they’re good for weight-loss diets. You don’t need to be a 
rabbit to enjoy nibbling on fresh carrots.
Carrots are versatile and very nutritious whether you enjoy them as a raw 
crunchy snack or cooked as a side dish. We suggest you eat carrots two to 
three times each week.
Exploiting carotenes and phytochemicals
Carrots have lots of vitamin A, a substantial amount of vitamin C (about 10 
percent of what you need for one day), and a lot of beta carotene. One cup 
of carrots contains 20,381 International Units of vitamin A, which is six times 
the amount you need for the day! Vitamin A has many health benefits:
 
✓ It sharpens your eyesight because a form of vitamin A called retinal is 
found in the retinas of your eyes.
 
✓ It triggers production of white blood cells that fight infection.
 
✓ It promotes normal cell growth and reproduction.
Vitamin C is important for strong immune system function and strong connec-
tive tissue under your skin, which helps to prevent wrinkles. Beta carotene is 

84
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
a powerful antioxidant that protects your cells and keeps you young. Carrots 
are also a good source of niacin (a B vitamin), potassium, and calcium.
Other benefits you can take advantage of by eating carrots include:
 
✓ Preventing certain cancers: A 2008 article in Nutrition and Cancer 
stated that diets rich in carotenoids (beta carotene, lutein, and zeax-
anthin — all related to vitamin A) are associated with a lower risk of 
cervical cancer in women. Research published in 2005 in The Journal of 
Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that a phytochemical found in car-
rots called falcarinol prevented cancer in lab rats.
 
✓ Preventing diabetes: Research published in 2008 in the journal Diabetes 
Care confirms that high levels of carotenoids in the blood are associ-
ated with a lower risk of diabetes. Eating a healthy diet, watching your 
weight, and getting the carotenoids found in carrots can help prevent 
the onset of type II diabetes (which most often occurs in adults).
 
✓ Helping you lose weight: One cup of sliced carrots contains only 50 
calories, plus lots of fiber, so eating carrots is a great way to feed your 
craving for crunchy foods while you’re watching your weight.
Finding and preparing carrots
You can find carrots in the fresh produce section, the canned foods section, 
and the freezer section of the grocery store. You can also find carrots as 
ingredients in soups, salads, and slaws.
Canned carrots often lack the flavor of fresh or frozen carrots, but they’re 
convenient. Be sure to read the label to avoid excess sodium. As for fresh 
carrots, choose ones that are bright orange and firm. Avoid fresh carrots that 
are soft or appear to be shriveled.
 
Baby carrots are really just grown-up carrots cut into small pieces. To save 
money, skip the baby carrots and buy full-sized carrots. Wash and slice them 
and place the pieces into snack-sized plastic bags for a less expensive, but still 
convenient, snack on the go or as lunch items for work or school. Add a little 
container of vegetable dip or your favorite salad dressing for extra flavor if 
you have a refrigerator handy.
Store carrots in the vegetable crisper in your refrigerator. Carrots keep well 
for about two weeks as long as they’re not cut. After they’re peeled and cut, 
they should be eaten within three or four days.
Carrots freeze well, either alone or with other vegetables. The freezer sec-
tion in your grocery store offers mixed vegetables such as peas and carrots 
or more exotic blends that include seasonings and sauces (just look out for 
extra calories and sodium in the sauces).

85
 Chapter 5: Vegging Out in a Good Way
Add extra chunks of carrots to soups and stews, or grate a carrot on top of a 
salad. Serve our ginger-glazed carrots (see Chapter 18) as a sweet side dish 
that even picky eaters will enjoy.
Kicking It Up a Notch with Kale
Kale is a sturdy, leafy green plant related to broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, 
and cabbage. It’s rich in vitamins and cancer-preventing phytochemicals called 
glucosinolates. And because kale is deep green in color, it also contains lutein and 
zeaxanthin, two more powerful antioxidants that are related to vitamin A.
We recommend that you eat kale two or three times per week, either raw (as 
a green in salads, for example) or cooked.
Meeting healthy objectives with kale
Kale is very rich in vitamin K and vitamin A (as the precursor of beta caro-
tene, which is also an antioxidant). Vitamin K is important for strong bones 
and normal blood clotting, and vitamin A is necessary for vision, cell repro-
duction, and fighting infections. Kale is also a good source of potassium, 
folate, and magnesium, so kale is good for a healthy heart.
Eating kale plays a positive role in meeting the following objectives:
 
✓ Managing your weight: Kale is nutrient dense, which means it has lots 
of nutritional value and is low in calories. Kale has more fiber than other 
greens, so it keeps you full longer and you’re comfortable eating less 
food.
 
✓ Preventing cancer: Cruciferous vegetables like kale contain the glu-
cosinolates that help to prevent cancer. The International Journal of 
Cancer reported in 2007 that eating a diet rich in kaempferol (one of the 
glucosinolates found in kale) is associated with a decreased risk of ovar-
ian cancer.
 
✓ Building stronger bones: The vitamin K in kale helps to regulate osteo-
calcin, a hormone involved in bone formation. Kale also contains magne-
sium and calcium, although the absorption of the calcium is inhibited by 
the presence of oxalic acid.
 
✓ Feeling more energetic: Kale is a good source of iron, which is needed 
for healthy blood cells that can carry plenty of oxygen and glucose (the 
fuel your body needs for energy) to all your cells.
 
✓ Waging war against infections: Kale contains a full day’s worth of vita-
min C and a lot of beta carotene. These nutrients help your immune 

86
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
system function properly by regulating the white blood cells that fight 
infections.
 
✓ Protecting your eyesight: Lutein and vitamin C were shown by the Age-
Related Eye Disease Study in 2001 to slow down the effects of macular 
degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.
Enjoying kale in the winter — 
and all year-round
Kale is available year-round in both the produce section and the canned 
vegetable aisle of your grocery store. Kale is also easy to grow in your own 
superfoods garden (see Chapter 14).
Look for fresh kale in the produce section near the lettuce and other greens. 
It should be dark green and fresh looking, with no wilted leaves. Choose kale 
with smaller leaves — they’re tenderer than larger, overgrown leaves. Kale is 
also available in cans and can be used just like cooked spinach.
 
Kale is in season during the winter, so it’s a good buy during a time when 
other vegetables are at their highest prices. It’s also available just in time for 
the cold and flu season. Eat lots of this superfood to help keep your immune 
system healthy and reduce your risk of getting sick.
Store kale in your refrigerator; it doesn’t do well in warmer temperatures.
Prepare kale by removing and discarding the tough stems. Just use the 
tender leaves, tearing them into bite-sized pieces. Kale can be used raw as a 
salad green, served warm in soups and side dish recipes, or roasted with a 
little bit of olive oil and a bit of salt for a nutritious, crispy snack. Canned kale 
can be used just like cooked spinach (see the later section “Selecting and 
savoring spinach” for more ideas).
Getting Strong with Spinach
Spinach is a leafy green vegetable rich in nutrients, including many important 
vitamins and minerals, plus fiber. Spinach can be eaten raw or cooked. Either 
way it’s low in calories — 1 cup of raw spinach has just 7 calories, while a 
cup of cooked spinach has about 32 calories (cooked spinach leaves are 
denser than raw ones).
The dark green pigments of spinach contain the antioxidants lutein and zeax-
anthin, which are good for your heart and your eyes, plus flavonoids called 
luteolin — phytochemicals that have anti-cancer properties, according to 
research published in 2008 in the journal Nutrition and Cancer.

87
 Chapter 5: Vegging Out in a Good Way
Because spinach is so nutritious, we suggest you eat it four times per week.
Bursting with antioxidant protection
Spinach is a good source of vitamins A, E, and K. All the cells in your body 
need vitamin A to promote reproduction through cell division. Vitamin E 
may help to prevent some cancers and cardiovascular disease, and vitamin 
K helps your blood to clot properly. Spinach also provides large amounts of 
beta carotene. Besides being a raw material for vitamin A production, beta 
carotene functions as an antioxidant that protects your body’s cells.
Spinach is rich in folate, potassium, and magnesium, which are important for 
your cardiovascular system and for healthy nerves and muscles. Spinach is 
also an excellent source of vitamin A (as good as carrots) and is a good plant 
source of iron (perfect for vegetarians).
When you eat spinach, you reap a host of health benefits, including the following:
 
✓ Keeping cancer at bay: The journal Nutrition and Cancer reported in 
2003 that several antioxidant compounds in spinach have anti-inflam-
matory and anti-cancer properties. A 2004 article in The Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute stated that folate may reduce the risk of ovarian 
cancer.
 
✓ Maintaining heart health: The folate in spinach reduces homocysteine 
levels that are associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease. The antioxidant lutein has been shown to reduce inflammation and 
plaque build-up in the arteries. Spinach also improves heart health with 
an ample amount of potassium while being naturally low in sodium.
 
 If you have high blood pressure, be sure to choose fresh or frozen spin-
ach to avoid sodium. If you want canned spinach, look for a brand that’s 
low in sodium.
 
✓ Strengthening bones: Vitamin K activates the protein osteocalcin 
that’s involved in bone formation. A vitamin K deficiency may lead to 
weaker bones. Spinach also contains magnesium and calcium, which 
are also helpful for strong bones. However, the calcium in spinach is 
The source of Popeye’s strength
E.C. Segar created the comic strip character 
Popeye in 1929 as a part of Thimble Theatre. 
Popeye was a sailor who had to regularly 
depend on his strength to fight the bad guys, 
especially his arch nemesis, Bluto. What was 
the source of Popeye’s muscular power? 
Spinach! Before each fight, Popeye gulped 
down spinach — straight from the can.

88
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
not absorbed as easily as calcium in dairy products, due to a substance 
called oxalic acid that’s also in spinach.
 
✓ Seeing clearly: Your eyes need vitamin A to function properly because 
one form of vitamin A, retinal, is an important component of your retina. 
Lutein, vitamin E, and beta carotene have all been studied for their 
ability to impair the development of macular degeneration, the leading 
cause of blindness in the elderly.
 
✓ Staying sharp: The antioxidants found in spinach help to keep your 
mind sharp. The Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences reported in 
2007 that diets rich in fruits and vegetables, especially berries and spin-
ach, help to maximize cognitive function long into old age. According 
to the journal Clinical Nutrition in 2008, decreased blood levels of B vita-
mins, including folate, correlate with a decline in cognitive function.
 
 While folate appears to be important for healthy brain function, folic 
acid supplements may not do the trick. A 2008 study in The Journal of 
the American Medical Association reported that B vitamin supplementa-
tion had no positive effect on slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s 
disease. For optimal brain function, rely on fruits and vegetables rather 
than folic acid supplements.
 
✓ Boosting energy: Spinach contains iron and folate, both of which are 
important for preventing anemia. This can be especially important for 
women who regularly have heavy menstrual periods.
 
✓ Preventing spinal cord malformation: Women who are deficient in 
folate are much more likely to give birth to babies with spina bifida, 
which affects the spinal cord and bones.
 
✓ Fighting infections: Vitamin A acts as an immune system regulator by 
making white blood cells that kill viruses and bacteria. Vitamin E, which 
is found in spinach, also impacts immune function. The Journal of the 
American Medical Association published a study in 2004 showing that 
extra vitamin E improved the immune systems of the elderly.
Selecting and savoring spinach
Fresh spinach is available year-round in just about every grocery store, usu-
ally right next to the salad greens. In fact, spinach can be substituted for let-
tuce in many salads to make them healthier and, oftentimes, less expensive, 
because spinach usually costs less than the upscale greens. Choose fresh 
spinach that is dark green in color and looks fresh — not wilted.
Frozen and canned spinach are also available. Canned spinach usually con-
tains added sodium, so if you’re on a sodium-restricted diet, be sure to read 
the labels to find brands with little or no sodium added.

 Chapter 5: Vegging Out in a Good Way
Store unwashed spinach in your refrigerator until you want to use it — wash-
ing the leaves beforehand causes them to deteriorate. Rinse the leaves with 
cold water thoroughly to remove dirt and bugs. For convenience, you can 
purchase pre-washed spinach in bags; however, you may still want to give 
these spinach leaves a good rinse before eating them.
Serve fresh spinach salad with a little bit of olive oil to improve the absorp-
tion of vitamin A and lutein. Fresh spinach leaves can also replace lettuce on 
sandwiches for an easy nutritional boost.
Both frozen and canned spinach are good in recipes that call for cooked spin-
ach (see Chapters 16 and 18 for spinach recipes), or you can just heat and 
serve for a simple side dish.
 
You can add spinach to pasta sauce or use it as a pizza topping. Spinach can 
also be incorporated into mashed potato recipes (delicious when you also 
add some parmesan cheese and garlic) or added to stuffing. Make breakfast 
healthier by using spinach in your omelets and quiches.
The Fruit that Eats Like a Vegetable: 
The Tomato
Tomatoes contain several vitamins, and the beautiful red coloring holds phy-
tochemicals that support your heart, immune system, and vision and may 
prevent cancer. You may have expected to see tomatoes included in Chapter 
4 on superfood fruits. Technically, tomatoes are fruits, but in most culinary 
circles, tomatoes are treated as vegetables, so we include them with the 
superfood vegetables. But there’s no controversy about the health benefits 
of tomatoes; in fact, we think you should eat one serving of tomatoes four or 
five days each week.
Irradiation of spinach and other greens
Several breakouts of food-borne illness from 
spinach contaminated with E. coli bacteria have 
resulted in a decision by the United States Food 
and Drug Administration to allow irradiation of 
spinach leaves and other greens before they 
are shipped to grocery stores. The irradiation 
does not harm the spinach, but it kills bacteria 
and other organisms responsible for the out-
breaks of food-borne illness.

Loving the perks of lycopene and more
Tomatoes offer vitamins A and C, plus lutein, zeaxanthin, and lots of lyco-
pene (a carotene that’s closely related to vitamin A and beta carotene), while 
being very low in calories. According to an article published in 2000 in The 
Canadian Medical Association Journal, lycopene is linked to having a lower 
risk of cardiovascular disease and a variety of cancers.
 
Lycopene is activated by heat and processing, so when you eat tomato juice, 
spaghetti sauce, or even ketchup, you actually get more lycopene than you 
would from a fresh tomato.
Tomatoes are also rich in potassium and very low in sodium, so they can be 
part of a healthy diet to reduce high blood pressure (just watch out for high-
sodium sauces and tomato soups).
We suggest that you eat tomatoes (or tomato products) five times each week 
to cash in on the following benefits:
 
✓ Keeping your eyes healthy: Vitamin A, lutein, and zeaxanthin are impor-
tant for healthy vision. Research published in The British Journal of 
Nutrition in 2009 reported that those antioxidants, plus lycopene, may 
help to reduce the risk of retinopathy (disease of the retina inside the 
eye) in diabetics.
 
✓ Protecting your heart: In The Canadian Medical Association Journal in 
2008, researchers stated that diets rich in tomato and tomato products 
reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, with the credit again going to 
lycopene. The other antioxidants in tomatoes help combat inflammation 
and plaque build-up in your arteries.
 
✓ Reducing your risk of cancer: According to the same article, eating 
tomatoes is associated with a reduced risk of several cancers, including 
From poison to superfood
North Americans generally believed that toma-
toes were poisonous until 1820. Colonel Robert 
Gibbon Johnson ate a tomato on the court-
house steps in Salem, New Jersey, and proved 
to onlookers that tomatoes were safe to eat. 
Today, according to California Tomato Growers, 
every American eats about 80 pounds of toma-
toes per year, and it is one of the most common 
vegetables grown in home gardens.

91
 Chapter 5: Vegging Out in a Good Way
prostate, breast, and digestive tract cancers. The researchers believe 
lycopene prevents cancer by protecting the DNA in cells.
 
✓ Boosting your immune system (and feeling better when you have a 
cold): Vitamins A and C boost your immune system, and in 2008, The 
Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry reported that lycopene helps to reduce 
inflammation in your airways caused by cold viruses. Eating tomatoes 
may help to reduce some of your suffering when you catch a cold.
Tempting your taste buds with tomatoes: 
Selecting, storing, and serving tips
Fresh tomatoes come in a variety of shapes and sizes and are available year-
round in the produce section of your grocery store, but there is a definite 
difference in flavor. The vine-ripened tomatoes of summer are much more 
flavorful than tomatoes that are harvested while immature and artificially 
ripened.
 
Take advantage of farmers’ markets during the summer months, where you’ll 
find juicy, vine-ripened tomatoes (along with other fresh vegetables).
Choose fresh tomatoes that are a deep red in color, firm, and heavy. Avoid 
tomatoes with bruised skins and those that feel too squishy.
Store your fresh tomatoes, just as they are, at room temperature. 
Refrigerated tomatoes lose their flavor.
When you’re ready to enjoy a tomato, simply rinse the skin, remove the stem, 
and slice or chop the tomato. Some people prefer to remove the seedy part 
and serve just the flesh.
For soups and sauces, you need to remove the skin first. Simply slice a small 
X through the skin in the bottom of your tomato, and then place it in sim-
mering water for a minute or two until the skin starts to break away from the 
tomato. Remove the tomato from the hot water, chill in cold water, and slide 
the skin right off.
Tomatoes are also sold in cans as tomato sauce, tomato pieces, or stewed 
whole tomatoes. Canned tomatoes are great for soups, stews, and sauces 
because they’re ready to use — you don’t have to remove the skins. If you’re 
watching your sodium intake, look for low-sodium varieties of canned toma-
toes, soups, and sauces.

92
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Getting tomatoes into your diet is easy. Sliced tomatoes are perfect for sand-
wiches. Smaller pieces of tomatoes are perfect for a salad, or you can pop a 
few cherry tomatoes in your mouth as a quick snack.
 
Make an aromatic and simple salad by alternating tomato slices with thinly 
sliced mozzarella cheese on a plate. Garnish with fresh basil leaves — whole 
or roughly chopped. Drizzle olive oil over the top, and add salt and pepper.
Other ideas for tomatoes include topping a baked potato with salsa, and 
adding slices of sun-dried tomatoes to your favorite vegetables. Broil thick 
tomato slices with a little bit of parmesan cheese, garlic, and bread crumbs. 
See Chapters 17 and 18 for some great recipe ideas for tomatoes.

Chapter 6
Gathering Nuts and Seeds
In This Chapter
▶ Going nuts for good health
▶ Discovering which seeds are super
▶ Storing nuts and seeds
▶ Getting your daily dose of nuts and seeds
D
uring the autumn months, you may notice that squirrels are busy gath-
ering nuts and seeds to store for the long winter ahead. That’s because 
nuts are both nutritious and packed with energy. Nuts and seeds are rich in 
healthful fats and phytochemicals, plus lots of vitamins and minerals. It makes 
a lot of sense if you think about it. Nuts and seeds (actually, nuts are really 
seeds, too) contain enough energy and nutrients to feed a sprouting tree.
Nuts and seeds are very healthful, but they’re often high in calories, so if you’re 
watching your weight, you’ll want to watch your serving sizes. Luckily, you can get 
a lot of nutrition from eating even a small amount of nuts. If you’re trying to gain 
weight, eating nuts and seeds is a healthful way to add extra calories. They’re quite 
delicious and can be added to any meal or eaten alone as a healthful snack.
In this chapter, we discuss our super nuts and seeds, how they work to keep 
you healthy, how many you should eat, and how often you should eat them.
 
The fats in nuts and seeds are sensitive to oxygen and go rancid if they aren’t 
stored properly. Nuts in the shell can be stored in a cool area and don’t need 
any care beyond that (the thick shells provide a natural oxygen barrier that pro-
tects the fats from going rancid). Nuts and seeds that have been shelled and pack-
aged in cans, jars, or bags can be stored in your pantry, but after you open the 
package, the nuts and seeds need to be stored in airtight containers in your refrig-
erator. Nuts that need to be stored for more than a few months can be frozen.
 
Steer clear of shelled nuts that are sold in bulk bins; they’re exposed to air 
and may not be as fresh as packaged nuts or nuts still in the shells. Unless you 
know when they were added to the bulk bin, you have no way of knowing how 
fresh bulk nuts really are.

Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Adding Almonds to Your Diet
Almonds are crunchy, delicious, and very good for you. They’re rich in fiber, 
monounsaturated fats, and phytochemicals that fight free radicals to keep 
the cells in your body healthy.
Almonds also contain polyphenols (phytonutrients that provide health 
benefits) — especially in the thin brown skin that covers the nut. According 
to an article published in 2008 in The Journal of Food Science, roasting almonds 
with the skin intact actually concentrates the amount of polyphenols.
The almonds you buy in the grocery store are sometimes called sweet 
almonds. Bitter almonds are processed and used to make pure almond 
extracts and liqueurs. Raw bitter almonds are actually toxic, but fortunately, 
the sale of raw bitter almonds is prohibited in the United States.
We suggest you eat 1 ounce of our superfood nuts every day, such as one 
serving of almonds (up to 23 nuts).
Filling up on fiber, healthful fats, 
and antioxidants
Almonds weigh in at 165 calories per ounce. They contain vitamin E and 
substantial amounts of magnesium, manganese, and copper. Magnesium is 
involved in many of the biochemical reactions that take place in your body. 
Manganese is an antioxidant and is necessary for healing wounds and keep-
ing bones strong. Copper is essential for the formation of healthy blood cells. 
In addition to all this, almonds offer the following health benefits:
 
✓ Lowering cholesterol: Almonds are rich in phytosterols (a plant version 
of cholesterol that’s good for you) that help regulate cholesterol levels 
in your body. Phytosterols and monounsaturated fats are particularly 
beneficial when they replace saturated fat, which increases cholesterol. 
Vitamin E, magnesium, and polyphenols also may increase the heart-
healthy effects of eating almonds.
 
✓ Preventing anemia: Almonds supply copper, which is necessary for normal 
red blood cell production. Copper and manganese also work as enzymes in 
some of the chemical reactions in your body that produce energy.
 
✓ Easing weight loss: Although almonds have a lot of calories, according 
to The British Journal of Nutrition in 2006, substituting monounsaturated 
fats for saturated fats (found in red meats) may help to increase weight 
loss, even if you don’t cut many calories. Almonds also help keep you 
full between meals because they’re rich in proteins and fiber.

95
 Chapter 6: Gathering Nuts and Seeds
 
✓ Protecting your prostate: According to research published in 2000 in the 
journal BJU International, beta-sitosterol, a phytosterol found in almonds, 
is effective for decreasing the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperpla-
sia (BPH) in men. BPH is a common condition where the prostate gland 
enlarges, resulting in difficulty in urination and sexual performance.
 
✓ Preventing diabetes: Research published in 2006 in The Journal of 
Nutrition states that almonds slow down the rises in blood sugar that 
occur after eating carbohydrate-rich meals. The polyphenols and vita-
min E in almonds also help to protect you from damaging free radicals.
Buying and enjoying almonds
Almonds are easy to find in any grocery store. The best almonds are still in 
the shells, which protect the delicate fats inside the nuts. Look for almonds 
with shells that are unbroken and free of mold. Use a nutcracker to open 
them — you may make a little mess with the broken shells, but freshly shelled 
almonds are quite a treat (and the added effort of cracking the shell makes for 
automatic portion control, because you can’t eat them by the handful).
 
While fresh almonds are best, they aren’t very convenient for cooking. For this 
purpose, you can find sealed packages of shelled, blanched almonds in the 
baking section of your grocery store.
You can buy whole blanched almonds and chop them up in a coffee grinder 
to retain the polyphenol-rich skin. Alternatively, you can buy sliced or sliv-
ered almonds (they lose the skins, but they still retain the good fats).
You can find roasted almonds in bags or cans in the snack section of the gro-
cery store. Be careful with these almonds, because they’re usually roasted in 
unhealthy oils and contain extra salt and artificial flavorings (as is the case 
with smoked almonds) that may not be good for you.
Store shelled almonds in a covered container in the refrigerator to protect 
the healthful fats. If you have a large amount (more than you can eat in a 
week), keep some in the freezer.
You can enjoy a handful of almonds as a protein- and fiber-rich afternoon snack 
(both protein and fiber will keep you feeling full until dinnertime). Or you can 
add them to many of your favorite dishes for extra crunch. Almonds have a 
delicious flavor that works well with savory foods as well as sweet foods.
Here are some delicious ideas for eating almonds:
 
✓ Enjoy almond butter in place of peanut butter on your sandwiches.
 
✓ Eat a handful of almonds with an apple for a superfoods snack.

96
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
 
✓ Sprinkle sliced almonds on a salad or on vegetables.
 
✓ Make a yogurt and berry parfait and top it with chopped almonds.
 
✓ Sprinkle slivered almonds over trout.
 
You can use raw almonds or toast them briefly before adding them to reci-
pes. Toasting (or roasting) almonds is best done just before eating. Toasting 
almonds is easy and augments the flavor. Place a nonstick skillet over medium 
heat and add sliced or slivered almonds. Stir frequently until they’re golden 
brown, about three to five minutes. You can also toast almonds by baking 
them in an oven heated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 minutes.
Getting Antioxidants with Brazil Nuts
Brazil nuts are rich in antioxidants and minerals that serve a wide variety of 
functions, such as the formation of thyroid hormones and immune system 
function, plus they give you protein and fiber. As with most nuts, eating 
Brazil nuts adds a balance of energy and nutrients to your superfoods diet. 
We suggest you eat six Brazil nuts twice a week.
Souping up your diet with selenium
Brazil nuts are rich in minerals, especially selenium, which works as an anti-
oxidant to protect the cells in your body and is needed for normal thyroid 
function (your thyroid works like a thermostat in your body to regulate 
energy use). Brazil nuts contain other minerals along with the selenium. 
They’re rich in magnesium, which is used in many chemical reactions in your 
body and is needed (along with calcium) for normal muscle and nerve func-
tion. Brazil nuts also contain calcium, potassium, zinc, and copper. As an 
added bonus, Brazil nuts are a good source of vitamin E, a natural antioxidant 
that protects your heart.
Nut butters
Everyone’s familiar with peanut butter (who 
doesn’t love a PB and J sandwich?), but there 
are several nut and seed butters that can be 
fun to try for a little variety. Popular nut butters 
include almond butter, cashew butter, sun-
flower seed butter, and pumpkin seed butter. 
They aren’t always easy to find at the local 
grocery store, but you can find them in online 
stores (see Chapter 13 for tips on online shop-
ping). They’re usually minimally processed and 
quite delicious.

97
 Chapter 6: Gathering Nuts and Seeds
Look to Brazil nuts to provide the following benefits:
 
✓ Immune system support: Selenium and zinc are important for fighting 
bacterial and viral infections. Selenium also protects cells, which may 
slow down diseases such as HIV/AIDs, according to a 2007 article in the 
journal Medical Hypotheses.
 
✓ Cancer prevention: Research published in 2007 in the journal BioFactors 
explains how selenium may prevent cancer by protecting normal, 
healthy cells and by slowing down the growth of cancerous cells.
 
✓ Heart protection: Brazil nuts contain lots of the monounsaturated fats 
that are also found in olive oil. The combination of these healthful fats 
and antioxidants helps to protect your heart and blood vessels, espe-
cially when you substitute Brazil nuts for foods high in saturated fats, 
such as red meat.
Breaking Brazil nuts
Brazil nuts are protected by a hard, thick shell. You can buy Brazil nuts with 
these shells intact in the produce section of your local grocery store. They’re 
also available already shelled and chopped in the baking goods section. They 
can be eaten as a snack or used in recipes.
 
Make the shells easier to crack by plunging whole Brazil nuts into boiling 
water for three minutes. Remove and let cool before cracking.
Brazil nuts are commonly found in packages of mixed nuts, along with 
cashews, almonds, and peanuts; however, they’re usually heavily salted and 
roasted in oil that adds extra calories from unhealthy fats. As an alternative, 
you can make your own mixed nuts by roasting coarsely chopped Brazil nuts, 
almonds, and walnuts at home.
Toast Brazil nuts in a sauté pan over medium heat for three to five minutes. 
They’re quite big, so you may want to chop them into ¼-inch-long pieces first.
Brazil nuts can be used in many interesting ways. Here are some ideas:
 
✓ Replace the meat in stir-fry recipes with chopped Brazil nuts.
 
✓ Add some variety to pesto recipes by using Brazil nuts in place of pine 
nuts or walnuts (see Chapter 17).
 
✓ Sprinkle chopped Brazil nuts on a green salad or on top of your favorite 
green vegetable.
 
✓ Stir chopped Brazil nuts into wild rice or rice pilaf.
 
✓ Mix chopped Brazil nuts into stuffing and dressing.

Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Loading Up on Lignins and 
More with Flax Seeds
These small seeds are powerful because they’re rich in omega-3 fatty acids 
and phytochemicals called lignins (a type of polyphenol). Lignins are anti-
oxidants that protect the cells in your body. Flax seeds also pack a powerful 
punch of fiber.
Flax seeds also add fiber, B vitamins, magnesium, and manganese, all of 
which are important for many different chemical reactions that occur in your 
body, to your daily superfoods diet.
We suggest you eat milled flax seeds every day. Start with 1 tablespoon and 
work your way up to 2 tablespoons, which you can eat all at once or through-
out the day.
Reaping the rewards of 
fiber and (good) fats
One tablespoon of ground flax seeds contains 2 grams of fiber and 37 calo-
ries. Whole flax seeds contain soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber dis-
solves in water (similar to the fiber in fruits) and helps regulate blood sugar 
and eliminates extra cholesterol. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water, 
but it adds bulk to the intestinal contents and helps to keep your digestive 
system regular.
The oil in flax contains large amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is 
converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 
just like the fats in fish. Omega-3 fatty acids are good for your cardiovascular 
system and your bones, and eating them helps you lose weight. Flax seeds’ 
many other health benefits include the following:
 
✓ Protecting your heart: The fiber and healthful fats in flax seeds reduce 
cholesterol levels and inflammation in your blood vessels, both of which 
are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Research published in 2008 
in The Journal of American College of Nutrition found that flax seeds 
also lower the levels of lipoproteins (complexes of fats and proteins — 
increased levels of certain lipoproteins correlate with an increased risk 
of cardiovascular disease).
 
✓ Reducing inflammation: The fats and the phytochemicals in flax seeds 
work together to reduce inflammation in the body. According to the 
journal Nutrition, Metabolism, and Cardiovascular Disease, research in 

99
 Chapter 6: Gathering Nuts and Seeds
2008 in Denmark found that eating muffins made with the addition of flax 
seed lignins called secoisolariciresinol diglucoside lowered C-Reactive 
Protein (CRP) levels in the study subjects. CRP is a blood test that 
measures inflammation in the body that may be caused by rheumatoid 
arthritis or other disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
and some cancers.
 
✓ Improving digestive function: The fiber in flax helps to keep your bowel 
movements regular.
 
✓ Maintaining strong bones: Omega-3 fatty acids help to maintain strong 
bones by reducing the amount of calcium that is lost from the bones, 
according to 2001 research published in The Journal of Nutrition.
 
✓ Preventing cancer: According to The International Journal of Cancer in 
2005, the lignans in flax inhibit the growth of cancer cells in the lab. A 
study published in the journal Urology found that men who ate diets rich 
in flax seed tended to have a lower risk of prostate cancer.
 
✓ Easing symptoms of BPH: The hormonal effect of the lignins helps 
to reduce urinary symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 
according to research published in The Journal of Medicinal Foods.
 
✓ Eliminating the discomfort of dry eyes: The American Journal of Clinical 
Nutrition reports that increasing dietary levels of omega-3 fatty acids 
reduced the incidence of dry eyes in participants of the Women’s Health 
Study (a large study involving more than 3,500 female health professionals).
 
✓ Keeping blood sugar levels normal: Chinese-American research found 
taking flax lignins daily helped improve blood sugar levels in patients with 
type 2 diabetes. The soluble fiber also helps to regulate blood sugar.
Grinding for good health
You can buy flax seeds or flaxseed oil (or both, if you’d like). You’ll get the 
most health benefits from whole flax seeds that you grind in your kitchen 
(just a few seconds in a coffee grinder will do) just before you eat them. If 
you eat the seeds whole, you won’t get as much of the fatty acids as grinding 
them provides. You can also buy milled flax seeds that have already been 
ground — just be sure they’re in airtight packaging.
Flaxseed oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids, but it doesn’t contain the 
lignins or the fiber. Only buy flaxseed oil that’s sold in opaque bottles that 
have been kept in the refrigerator case to keep the delicate oils from spoiling.
 
While it’s okay to add milled flax seeds to recipes for baked goods, don’t use 
flaxseed oil as cooking oil. It doesn’t handle heat well at all and is best added 
to foods that have already been cooked.

100
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
 
If you want more omega-3 fatty acids in your cooking oil, use canola oil instead 
of vegetable oil. Canola oil is rich in monounsaturated fats (like those found in 
olive oil), so it is much better suited for cooking than flaxseed oil.
 
Milled flax seeds and flaxseed oil lose their healthful properties more quickly 
than whole flax seeds, so if you buy oil or milled seeds, buy them in small 
amounts and keep them refrigerated.
Flax seeds have a nice nutty flavor, so you can sprinkle them on other foods 
or just take a spoonful or two every day like a dietary supplement. This 
works just fine; however, taking large amounts (more than 2 tablespoons) at 
one time may lead to some temporary digestive discomfort. Some tips for get-
ting your daily flax:
 
✓ Sprinkle ground flax seeds on your morning oatmeal for a healthful 
superfoods breakfast.
 
✓ Add ground flax seeds to muffin, waffle, or pancake recipes (see Chapter 
16 for our superfood versions of these recipes).
 
✓ Top your salad or soup with ground flax seeds, or add them to your 
favorite vegetable side dishes.
 
✓ Stir ground flax seeds into some plain yogurt sweetened with a little 
honey.
 
✓ Add some fiber to your smoothies with ground flax seeds.
You can also use flaxseed oil to increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids 
every day. Take it by the spoonful (1 or 2 teaspoons per day) or add the oil 
to foods:
 
✓ Drizzle flaxseed oil on pancakes, waffles, or toast at breakfast.
 
✓ Pour a teaspoon of the oil on cooked vegetables.
 
✓ Make a salad dressing by blending 1 cup flaxseed oil, 1/2 cup balsamic 
vinegar, and 1 teaspoon mustard.
 
✓ Add flaxseed oil to pasta, potatoes, or rice dishes.
Discovering the Perks of Pecans
Pecans are another nut rich in monounsaturated fats, which lower LDL cho-
lesterol (the bad cholesterol). They contain other nutrients and phytochemi-
cals that improve your health as well.
We suggest you eat 1 ounce of pecans (about 19 nuts) at least once a week as 
one of your daily servings of nuts.

101
 Chapter 6: Gathering Nuts and Seeds
Helping the heart and more
With a calorie count of 196, 1 ounce of pecans (about 19 halves) offers 2.7 
grams of fiber, plus a healthy dose of minerals and vitamins. Pecans contain 
magnesium and manganese, two important minerals in many bodily chemi-
cal reactions. Pecans are a good source of potassium, which helps keep your 
heart healthy and your blood pressure in check. You get a good dose of zinc 
from pecans too, which your body needs to have a strong immune system. 
Zinc is also an important component of male health.
There are plenty of vitamins in pecans, like vitamin E, an antioxidant that 
protects the cells in your body, and B vitamins: niacin, pantothenic acid, and 
thiamin. B vitamins are necessary for your body to produce energy from the 
foods you eat.
Adding pecans to your superfoods diet gives you a lot of bang for the buck, 
including
 
✓ Keeping your heart healthy: Pecans are rich in oleic acid, the monoun-
saturated fat found in olive oil (see Chapter 9). Monounsaturated fats 
help to reduce cholesterol and improve heart health, especially when 
they’re eaten in place of saturated fats.
 
 Research published in 2001 in The Journal of Nutrition showed that 
eating pecans in place of other foods effectively lowered total choles-
terol, LDL cholesterol (the bad stuff), and triglycerides (another type of 
blood fat that, when elevated, raises your risk for heart disease), without 
adding any additional weight.
 
✓ Improving prostate health: Pecans are rich in beta-sitosterol, a phytos-
terol that has been studied for prostate health. Beta-sitosterol effectively 
decreases the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men, 
as reported in the journal BJU International in 2000. BPH is a common 
condition that results in difficulties in urination and sexual performance.
 
✓ Losing extra fat: According to The Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health 
in 2003, diets rich in monounsaturated fats resulted in weight loss 
even though study participants weren’t required to count any calories. 
Although pecans are high in calories, they also contain a lot of fiber and 
protein that help you feel full much longer than many other foods.
 
✓ Fighting cancer: Oleic acid, the monounsaturated fat found in pecans, 
has been shown to inhibit breast cancer cells in the lab, according to 
2005 research in the journal Annals of Oncology. The journal Nutrition 
and Cancer published research in 1999 that showed diets rich in nuts, 
such as pecans, were associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer.

102
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Preparing pecans
Pecans that are still in the shell are available in the produce section of your 
local grocery store. The shells should be smooth and light brown in color, 
with no evidence of holes, cracks or breaks, or mold growth.
Shelled pecans are sold in the baked goods section of the grocery store or in 
the bulk foods area. They look a little like walnuts but have a brown skin simi-
lar to almonds. Shelled pecans are more convenient than unshelled pecans for 
cooking. You can choose from whole pecans, pecan halves, or chopped pieces.
Pecans make great snacks when you crack them open with a nutcracker, or 
you can just munch on a handful of shelled pecan halves.
 
Pecans are often included in commercial packages of mixed nuts. 
Unfortunately, mixed nuts contain lots of salt and the nuts are roasted in 
unhealthy oils that add extra calories.
Toasting pecans enhances their flavor. Simply place one layer of pecans in 
a skillet or sauté pan over medium heat. Stir frequently and toast for about 
three to five minutes. Serve as a warm snack or add to your favorite recipes.
Pecans work well as an ingredient in sweet or savory dishes. You’ll frequently 
find pecans in delicious and healthy recipes (sorry, pecan pie doesn’t count). 
Check out our Spinach Quiche with Pecans in Chapter 16. Pecans make a 
great addition to many foods:
 
✓ Sauté broccoli, green beans, or asparagus with pecans in a little olive oil 
for a deliciously healthful side dish.
 
✓ Add chopped pecans to muffin recipes.
 
✓ Combine chopped pecans and bread crumbs to coat fish or skinless 
chicken breasts. Sauté until fish or chicken is cooked thoroughly.
 
✓ Add pecans to chicken or tuna salads.
 
✓ Mix chopped pecans into your morning oatmeal (see Chapter 16 for our 
Banana Cream Oatmeal recipe).
 
✓ Toast pecans and add them to your own granola mix (see our recipe in 
Chapter 16).
Getting Seeds from the Great Pumpkin
If you’ve ever carved a jack-o-lantern, you’ve seen raw pumpkin seeds cov-
ered in pumpkin pulp. They don’t look so great covered in all those “pumpkin 
guts,” but those seeds are actually very good for your health. They contain 

103
 Chapter 6: Gathering Nuts and Seeds
lots of nutrients and healthful fats. We suggest you eat pumpkin seeds two or 
three times each week.
Relieving anxiety while 
promoting good health
Pumpkin seeds contain the healthful omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid, 
which works as an anti-inflammatory agent. The seeds are also very rich in 
phytosterols, the plant version of cholesterol.
Pumpkin seeds contain a large amount of magnesium, which you need for normal 
nerve and muscle function and many chemical reactions in your body. Pumpkin 
seeds are a good source of iron and B vitamins, which your body needs for energy, 
and potassium, which helps protect your heart and regulates blood pressure.
One ounce of pumpkin seeds contains 148 calories. The payback comes in 
the following forms:
 
✓ Lowering cholesterol: According to The Journal of Agricultural and Food 
Chemistry in 2005, pumpkin seeds are rich in phytosterols that help to 
reduce cholesterol. The omega-3 fatty acids in pumpkin seeds also help 
to reduce inflammation and decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.
 
✓ Avoiding bladder stones: Research from Thailand found that eating 
pumpkin seeds reduced the risk of bladder stones (small masses of min-
erals that form in the urinary bladder). This benefit was attributed to the 
high levels of phosphorus in the seeds.
 
✓ Treating anxiety: Pumpkin seeds are rich in tryptophan, an amino acid that’s 
important for the production of brain chemicals that affect your mood. The 
Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology reported on a small study 
in 2007 that discovered that tryptophan in seeds helped to relieve symptoms 
of social anxiety disorder. Tryptophan is also used as a sleep aid.
 
✓ Protecting your prostate: Eating pumpkin seeds may help to reduce the 
risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia. According to research published in 
2006 in The Journal of Medicinal Foods, pumpkin seed oil reduces pros-
tate hyperplasia in rats by inhibiting testosterone.
Picking pumpkin seeds
Pumpkin seeds are available in the snack section of the grocery store; how-
ever, most are roasted in oils that add extra fat and calories. Look instead for 
pumpkin seeds in the baking area of your grocery store. Or, for a fun project, 
toast your own pumpkin seeds at home — a great thing to do after carving 
those Halloween pumpkins.

Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
 
Cut open a pumpkin and remove the pulp and seeds. Clean the pulp from the 
seeds and soak them in water overnight. Some people, especially those who 
have a hard time digesting raw nuts and seeds, find they can enjoy these foods 
more often if they’re soaked and roasted or dehydrated. But if you don’t have 
any digestive issues with seeds, or if you don’t have the time or inclination to 
soak the seeds overnight, you can skip that step. Spread the seeds on a paper 
towel to dry, then spread them on a cookie sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and 
add a few sprinkles of salt. Roast in an oven heated to 325 degrees Fahrenheit 
for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the seeds are golden brown.
Pumpkin seeds can also be roasted in your microwave. Spread the seeds on 
a glass tray, place it in the microwave, and cook on high for seven minutes or 
until seeds are light golden brown.
 
For variety, sprinkle curry powder or any other seasoned powder on the 
pumpkin seeds before roasting.
Keep the pumpkin seeds in an airtight container. Munch on the seeds as a 
healthful snack or add them to vegetables, salads, or your own granola (see 
Chapter 16 for a granola recipe). You can also buy dark red pumpkin seed oil, 
which is delicious drizzled over salads or vegetables.
Cracking Wonderful Walnuts
Humans have been eating walnuts for thousands of years. And for good 
reason — walnuts help keep your heart healthy. They’re rich in vitamins, 
minerals, fiber, and ALA — the plant version of omega-3 fatty acids.
Almost all walnuts found in grocery stores are English walnuts (although they 
probably originated in Persia). They’re delicious as a snack or as an addition 
to main dishes, sides, and salads.
Black walnuts are native to North America and are edible; however, they 
have a very thick, tough shell. In fact, a typical nutcracker won’t break them 
open. You can find shelled black walnuts online or in some specialty stores.
We suggest you eat 1 ounce of walnuts every day; that’s about 14 halves.
Providing marvelous melatonin and more
Walnuts are one of the few foods rich in melatonin, a hormone that protects 
the cells in your body. As you age, your body makes less melatonin and you 
lose some of that protection. Melatonin also helps you have normal sleep 
cycles, which are often disturbed as the body’s natural levels of melatonin 
fall with age.

105
 Chapter 6: Gathering Nuts and Seeds
Along with melatonin, walnuts have several antioxidants like vitamin E and 
polyphenols. A Norwegian study published in 2006 in The American Journal of 
Clinical Nutrition ranked walnuts very high on a list of foods with the highest 
amounts of antioxidants per servings; they came in second only to blackberries.
Walnuts contain healthful monounsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids, 
which are necessary for normal nervous system and brain function, plus they 
function as anti-inflammatory agents. While the omega-3 fatty acids aren’t 
exactly the same as those found in fish and seafood, your body can convert a 
lot of the ALA to the two forms found in fish: EPA and DHA.
You also get plenty of protein and fiber from walnuts. One ounce of walnuts 
(about 14 halves) contains 4 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber. Walnuts 
also have magnesium, potassium, and plant sterols like beta-sitosterol. 
Magnesium is needed for many chemical reactions in your body, plus normal 
muscle and nerve function. Potassium helps keep your blood pressure 
normal. Plant sterols reduce cholesterol and promote prostate health.
And if all that’s not enough, you can count on walnuts to provide the follow-
ing benefits, too:
 
✓ Keeping arteries healthy: The journal Circulation published studies in 
2004 that found that people who ate walnuts showed improved blood 
vessel function. That same study showed that eating walnuts also 
reduces total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (the bad kind). Lowering 
cholesterol helps to protect your heart.
 
✓ Strengthening bones: The Nutrition Journal reported in 2007 that diets 
rich in plant-based omega-3 fatty acids reduce bone loss. The magne-
sium in walnuts also helps to keep bones strong.
 
✓ Making weight loss easier: Although they’re energy-dense and contain 
about 185 calories per ounce, research published in The British Journal 
of Nutrition indicated in 2005 that adding walnuts to diets did not con-
tribute to weight gain. The protein and fiber in walnuts make for a very 
satisfying superfood that can help keep you going until the next meal.
 
✓ Helping diabetics: Research published in Diabetes Care showed in 2004 
that eating walnuts helped improve the cholesterol levels of patients 
with type 2 diabetes. This is important because people with type 2 dia-
betes are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease.
 
✓ Staying youthful: The melatonin and other antioxidants in walnuts have 
strong anti-aging properties because they protect your cells from damage.
Selecting and enjoying walnuts
You may find walnuts in the shell in the produce section of your local gro-
cery store. Walnuts in the shell are easy to find in the fall, but you may have a 

106
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
tougher time finding them the rest of the year. Look for walnuts that feel heavy 
and aren’t cracked or broken, and be sure they show no signs of mold growth.
Shelled walnuts are sold in bags containing walnut halves or chopped walnut 
pieces. Walnuts don’t have a skin like almonds, so you can go with either 
halves or pieces without sacrificing nutrition. They’re usually located in the 
baking goods section of the grocery store, but you may also find them near 
the fresh produce.
Walnuts make a great snack with a piece of fresh fruit. Use a nutcracker to 
crack open the shells of fresh walnuts. Here are some other ideas for enjoy-
ing walnuts as part of a superfoods diet:
 
✓ Add walnuts to a bowl of fresh berries.
 
✓ Top a green salad with 1/4 cup of walnut pieces.
 
✓ Make your own granola with walnuts, whole-grain cereals, and dried fruits.
 
✓ Sauté chopped walnuts in a little olive oil and substitute them for meats 
in pasta dishes or on pizzas.
 
To bring out the flavor in walnuts, toast halves or pieces in a dry, nonstick 
skillet over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
Getting the goodness every day
We recommend you eat 1 ounce of nuts every 
day and either a spoonful or two of flax seeds or 
1 ounce of pumpkin seeds every day. Here’s a 
sample of how to get the proper amount of nuts 
and seeds each week:
 ✓ Sunday: Add 1 tablespoon of flax seeds to 
your morning smoothie, and top your lunch-
time salad with 1 ounce of walnuts.
 ✓ Monday: Munch on 1 ounce of pumpkin 
seeds for a midmorning snack, and have 
six Brazil nuts after dinner.
 ✓ Tuesday: Stir 1 tablespoon of flax seeds into 
a serving of yogurt, and serve your green 
beans with 1 ounce roasted almonds per 
serving at dinnertime.
 ✓ Wednesday: Spread 1 tablespoon of flax-
seed oil on your toast in the morning, and 
enjoy 19 toasted pecans with fresh apple 
slices, whole-grain crackers, and your 
favorite cheese for a light evening meal.
 ✓ Thursday: Chop 1 ounce of walnuts and add 
to a bowl of oatmeal in the morning, and top 
a bowl of fresh berries with light whipped 
topping, 1 tablespoon flax seeds, and six 
chopped Brazil nuts for a snack or dessert.
 ✓ Friday: Enjoy 23 almonds as a midmorning 
snack, and drizzle 1 tablespoon of flaxseed 
oil over your vegetables at dinner.
 ✓ Saturday: Chop 19 pecans into small pieces 
and add them to a lunchtime pizza topped 
with spinach and tomatoes, and make a 
simple salad dressing with flaxseed oil and 
balsamic vinegar.

In This Chapter
▶ Understanding why fish is so good for you
▶ Deciphering worries about mercury
▶ Exploring the wonders of salmon, tuna, sardines, and trout
S
eafood makes a delicious and healthy addition to a superfoods diet, and 
our four superfood fish — salmon, tuna, sardines, and trout — make the 
best choices. So, what qualifies these fish as superfoods? Although fish don’t 
contain phytochemicals or fiber like plant-based foods, they do contain sev-
eral vital nutrients.
An even bigger benefit is their fat content, particularly a type of fat called 
omega-3 fatty acids, which are lacking in many people’s diets. The fish that 
live in cold water have the highest amounts of omega-3 fats per serving.
Many experts suggest that eating fish every week (or taking omega-3 fatty acid 
supplements daily) is a great idea to keep your heart healthy. But eating fish 
does a lot more than that. In this chapter, we tell you what makes fish so good 
for you, outline the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in fish, and help you 
figure out how to choose fish at the grocery store or on a restaurant menu.
Catching On to the Benefits 
of Superfood Fish
When you replace high-fat red meats with baked, grilled, or broiled fish 
at least twice a week, you do your heart — and the rest of your body — a 
healthy favor. There are so many reasons to enjoy fish in your superfoods 
diet that we encourage you to eat at least 12 ounces of low-mercury super-
food fish each week. If fish isn’t your thing, or if you’re worried about being 
exposed to mercury, never fear: Taking omega-3 fatty acids as dietary supple-
ments (2,500 milligrams of fish oil) is also acceptable, as we explain in the 
following sections.

108
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
 
Keep fish healthy by preparing it right. Baked, broiled, grilled, or pan-fried fish 
are best. Stay away from heavy, creamy sauces that add extra calories and 
unhealthy fats. And stay away from deep-fried fish, too. Fish is healthy; fish 
sticks are not.
Enjoying the mega-boost 
of omega-3 fatty acids
Superfood fish offer many advantages, including high levels of omega-3 fatty 
acids. Omega-3 fatty acids (also known as linolenic acid) are one type of poly-
unsaturated fatty acid (polyunsaturated refers to the chemical structure — it 
means there is more than one double bond in the fatty acid molecule). Fish and 
seafood are rich in a form of linolenic acid that’s made up of two different fatty 
acids called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
There’s another type of polyunsaturated fatty acid called omega-6 fatty acid, 
found mainly in vegetable oils (like corn oil and safflower oil). Both omega-3 
and omega-6 are considered essential because you have to get them from 
your diet; your body can’t manufacture them.
Even though most people know that both of these fats are important, many 
experts agree that few people eat these two fats in the proper balance. 
Generally, most people eat too many omega-6 fatty acids and not enough 
omega-3 fatty acids. This imbalance of fatty acids leads to your body being in 
a pro-inflammatory state, whereby your body is more prone to develop inflam-
mation that can lead to chronic disease and pain.
The average person’s diet has a 15 to 1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 — or 
worse. No one knows what the optimal ratio should be, but many experts 
think it should be closer to 4 to 1 — that is, no more than 4 times as many 
omega-6 fatty acids as omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in some plant 
foods such as flax seeds, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, soy, canola oil, and wal-
nuts, but the best source of these fats is fish and seafood.
Omega-3 fatty acids fight inflammation, but they do so much more. They’re 
particularly important for brain development and cognitive function, plus 
they may be important for eye health. Omega-3 fats also protect your heart 
by keeping your blood vessels healthy, lowering your cholesterol, and, in 
some cases, regulating the rhythm of your heartbeats.
Pumping up your brain
Omega-3 fatty acids, especially DHA, are crucial for the formation of the brain 
during the last trimester of pregnancy and the first three months of infancy. 

109
 Chapter 7: Angling for Super Seafood
Studies published in 1994 in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed 
that premature infants who were fed DHA-enriched formulas had better 
cognitive function. Many more studies have confirmed the importance of 
DHA for brain development. A study published in 2008 in the Journal of Child 
Development showed that children born from mothers with higher levels of 
DHA had better cognitive function. Although the exact amount needed for 
pregnant women has not been established, a common recommendation is 
250 mg of DHA daily.
Of course, infants can’t eat fish, but pregnant and breast-feeding mothers can 
get ample amounts of DHA in their diets eating safe fish and dietary supple-
ments. The FDA states that salmon and light pink canned tuna are safe, along 
with shrimp and Pollack. (Unfortunately, pregnant women also have to be 
concerned with potential mercury toxicity in fish. See the section “A few 
words on mercury,” later in this chapter.)
Omega-3 fatty acids are also important for keeping your brain healthy as you 
age. The Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported in 2007 that elderly men who 
ate diets high in fish had better brain function than those who did not.
Helping your heart
Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids helps keep your heart healthy in sev-
eral ways. The omega-3 fatty acids help normalize cholesterol levels and 
lower triglycerides. Both cholesterol and triglycerides are fats found in the 
blood; high levels of either fat are related to a higher risk of cardiovascular 
disease.
Omega-3 fatty acids are valuable for the rhythm of heartbeats. The American 
Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported in 2000 that omega-3 fatty acids may 
help to prevent arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and that fish should be 
included in the diet in order to help prevent deaths from heart disease.
Opting for plant-based omega-3 fatty acids
If you don’t want to eat fish or seafood, you can 
get omega-3 fatty acids from some plant foods, 
such as walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and flax seeds 
in a form called alpha linolenic acid (ALA). 
Your body can use EPA and DHA just as they 
are; however, your body needs to make some 
changes in the ALA to convert it to the EPA or 
DHA forms. Most of the time, that works just 
fine. However, if you need larger amounts (if you 
want to reduce cholesterol or inflammation, for 
example, or if you’re a breast-feeding mother), 
your body may not be able to make enough EPA 
and DHA from the ALA. In this case, your best 
choice is to take mercury-free fish oil or algal oil 
(from ocean algae) capsules.

110
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
An article in Cardiovascular Research in 2003 explained how fish oil improved 
the health of blood vessels. The authors contend that adding two or three 
servings of fish to your diet each week may be beneficial for having strong 
blood vessels. When your blood vessels are healthy, you’re less likely to have 
heart disease or suffer a stroke.
The American Heart Association suggests that everyone eat fish (preferably 
oily fish) at least twice a week to help prevent heart disease. The AHA also 
suggests that people who already have heart disease or elevated triglycer-
ides take extra fish oil in the form of dietary supplementation.
Easing pain and inflammation
The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish act as natural anti-inflammatory agents. 
The journal Rheumatology reported in 2008 that omega-3 fatty acids from cod 
liver oil work as an effective pain reliever in patients with rheumatoid arthri-
tis. Patients who took cod liver oil were able to use fewer non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs.
Omega-3 fatty acids may also help to reduce the suffering of dry eye syn-
drome. A study reported in 2007 in the journal BMC Ophthalmology found 
that omega-3 supplements improved the visual acuity in patients who have 
macular degeneration (a common complication of diabetes and the leading 
cause of blindness in the elderly).
Discovering what else fish has to offer
In general, fish is a good source of several nutrients, including the following:
 
✓ Magnesium is crucial for many chemical reactions in your body and 
helping your muscles and nervous system to function properly.
 
✓ Selenium is an antioxidant mineral that helps protect the cells in your 
body from damaging free radicals. It’s also important for healthy sperm 
counts in men.
 
✓ Many of the B vitamins have a variety of roles in your body, includ-
ing the breakdown of carbohydrates into glucose (the fuel your body 
needs), the breakdown of fats and proteins (for more energy and for 
building body tissues), the production of red blood cells, and normal 
nervous system function.
 
✓ Potassium helps control your blood pressure.
 
✓ Calcium is important for strong bones and teeth, as well as normal 
muscle and nerve function.
 
✓ Iron is needed for healthy blood.
 
✓ Zinc is involved in thousands of processes in your body, such as wound 
healing, immune function, and protein synthesis.

111
 Chapter 7: Angling for Super Seafood
Fish is also a terrific source of protein. It’s a complete source of protein, con-
taining all the essential amino acids. A 3-ounce serving of fish has between 15 
and 20 grams of protein, depending on the type of fish you’re eating. Fish can 
be especially beneficial for those watching their weight, because it’s not only 
high in protein but also low in fat.
Fish provides your body with so-called “good” fats while being very low in 
artery-clogging saturated fats. That makes fish an excellent main course for a 
heart-healthy meal.
A few words on mercury
Methyl mercury is a toxic metal that has polluted our waters across the 
globe. The fish and seafood that live in the water are exposed to that mer-
cury, and when you eat mercury-contaminated fish, your body, in turn, is 
exposed to this metal.
 
While your body can detoxify and eliminate a small amount of mercury, if you 
get too much, you can become quite sick with central nervous system dis-
orders. Mercury may have an even stronger negative effect on the cognitive 
development of babies.
So, this could pose a problem. Fish is a very healthy food with all the nutri-
ents and omega-3 fatty acids it has to offer, but methyl mercury contamina-
tion is bad. What to do?
You have a few options:
 
✓ You can skip the fish and eat plants that have omega-3 fatty acids, like 
flax or chia seeds.
 
✓ You can take omega-3 fatty acid supplements that are mercury-free.
 
✓ You can eat fish that’s considered to be low in mercury, such as salmon, 
sardines, trout, and tuna (our superfood fish).
 
Which fish should you avoid? Older, larger fish like shark, swordfish, and king 
mackerel tend to have the highest levels of mercury, according to the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration.
 
If you want more omega-3s for therapeutic reasons, you can take omega-3 
supplements, but be sure to speak to your doctor before you start gulping 
down mega-doses (more than 2,500 milligrams a day) of fish oil. This is espe-
cially important if you’re taking certain medications such as blood-thinners: 
The combination of blood thinners and high doses of omega-3 fatty acids may 
increase your risk of bleeding.

112
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Seeing What Salmon Has to Offer
Salmon is a very richly flavored fish found in cold ocean waters. It has the 
highest levels of omega-3 fatty acids of commercially available fish. The fat 
content makes it pretty easy to cook because, unlike some other types of 
fish, salmon is less likely to become dry if you overcook it.
Getting the lowdown on nutrition
Salmon is a good source of healthful protein, vitamins, and minerals. A 
6-ounce salmon fillet has 240 calories and favorable amounts of these impor-
tant nutrients:
 
✓ Magnesium helps regulate muscle contractions and can also help relax 
the muscles within artery walls. This makes magnesium important in 
reducing migraines and blood pressure. Magnesium is also necessary for 
the absorption of calcium.
 
✓ Potassium is important for regulating the electrolytes in your body and 
the movement of water inside the cells. It helps the heart beat regularly 
and it supports the nervous system.
 
✓ Selenium is a trace mineral needed only in small amounts to produce 
healthy benefits. Selenium binds with protein to become an antioxidant 
and can help reduce the risk of diseases such as cancer.
Choosing wild or farmed fish
The fresh or frozen fish you buy in the gro-
cery store or at a restaurant may be wild 
or farm-raised. Are there any differences? 
Some experts believe the fat content of farmed 
fish isn’t as healthy as the fat content in wild-
caught fish.
The American Dietetic Association sponsored 
a study on the omega-3 levels in several farm-
raised fish and found that farm-raised salmon 
and trout had healthy levels of omega-3 fatty 
acids, but that farm-raised tilapia and catfish 
had less omega-3 fats in contrast to higher 
levels of omega-6 fats. This ratio of higher 
omega-6 fats is considered by many experts to 
be pro-inflammatory.
This study suggests that at least two of our 
superfood selections — salmon and trout — 
are good for you whether they’re farm-raised or 
wild-caught. Typically, farm-raised fish are less 
expensive, and it isn’t clear that higher-priced 
wild-caught fish are worth the extra cost — at 
least as far as the fat content is concerned.

113
 Chapter 7: Angling for Super Seafood
 
✓ B vitamins consist of eight individual vitamins that are important for 
many functions of the body, including your immune system, metabolism, 
and cognition.
 
✓ Omega-3 fats help reduce inflammation in muscles, which is good for 
athletes, and they also help reduce inflammation associated with heart 
disease. Omega-3 fats reduce the levels of bad cholesterol and can help 
lower blood pressure.
Serving up salmon
Buying and preparing salmon is a cinch. Fresh salmon may be available 
at your local grocery store, or you may find frozen salmon fillets, smoked 
salmon, or canned salmon chunks — they’re all good for you. Salmon is also 
commonly found on the menus of many restaurants if you’d rather order 
it ready-made. In fact, salmon could easily be the healthiest choice on the 
menu because it’s usually baked, grilled, or broiled and served with veg-
etables and salad. Compare that to a typical plate of white fish (like cod or 
haddock) that’s often deep-fried and served with French fries. With so many 
great salmon options, you may have to sample each one to see which is your 
salmon of choice.
About 90 percent of North American salmon comes from Alaska. Varieties of 
salmon found in the Pacific Ocean include the Chinook or King salmon, the 
Coho or Silver salmon, and the Sockeye or Red salmon. The one variety of 
salmon found in the Atlantic Ocean is the Atlantic salmon, which is mostly 
farm-raised rather than wild-caught. Any variety is a good addition to your 
superfoods diet, so choose the one with the taste and texture you like best.
When you decide to buy fresh salmon, first check out the food safety prac-
tices of the store. The seafood area should be clean and have the aroma of 
fresh fish. The fish should be on ice, preferably under a cover.
If you’re looking at a fillet, it should be pinkish in color with no milky fluids. 
The skin should be fresh and shiny and the fillet should smell fresh, without a 
strong fishy odor. The flesh should be firm, not mushy.
Fresh salmon lasts in the refrigerator for 48 hours, so it must be eaten or 
stored securely in a freezer-safe bag or container within that time period. 
Salmon fillets can be frozen; however, they should be cooked and eaten 
within three months.
If you’re shopping for the whole fish, the eyes should be clear, the skin 
should be shiny, and the gills should be bright red. Older fish have cloudy 

114
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
eyes and brownish-red gills. As with fillets, don’t buy a fish that has a strong 
fishy odor.
Salmon fillets can be grilled, broiled, poached, seared in a pan, or baked in 
the oven. Whole salmon can be grilled or baked in the oven. Many recipes are 
available for salmon: We offer two recipes for baked salmon in Chapter 17.
 
Salmon cooks quickly. Broil it about 10 minutes per each inch of thickness, or 
bake fillets at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes.
Canned salmon is convenient and ready to use for sandwiches, salads, and 
recipes for dishes like salmon cakes (see our recipe in Chapter 19). Canned 
salmon may also include skin and soft bones that you eat right along with 
the flesh.
Salmon is often smoked and served with crackers as an appetizer, on bagels 
with cream cheese, or combined with cream cheese and lemon juice.
Making the Most of Super Sardines
The word sardine refers to any of a variety of species of small oily fish, 
including herring, pilchard, and sprats. These small fish are found in both the 
Atlantic and Pacific oceans and in both northern and southern hemispheres.
Sardines have edible bones that you may often find packed into flat cans. If 
you’re fortunate enough to have a fish market close by, you may be able to 
find fresh sardines. Either way, sardines are very rich in omega-3 fatty acids 
and other nutrients, which make them a superfood fish.
Packing a big nutritional punch
For being small fish, sardines really pack a nutritional punch. Three ounces 
of sardines contain about 175 calories and are a rich source of
 
✓ Calcium: The most abundant mineral in the body, calcium is mostly 
stored in the bones and teeth. About 1 percent of calcium circulates 
around the body and is very important for muscle and blood vessel con-
tractions. Calcium is important for bones because if there isn’t enough 
calcium in the blood, the body takes it from the bones, making them 
weak and susceptible to a disease called osteoporosis.
 
✓ Iron: The most important function of iron is the transportation of 
oxygen throughout the body. Iron is a component of hemoglobin, which 
is the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cell.

115
 Chapter 7: Angling for Super Seafood
 
✓ Zinc: Most commonly associated with strengthening the immune 
system, zinc is also important for many other functions, such as wound 
healing and the development of taste and smell.
 
✓ Omega-3 fatty acids: These good fats can help reduce inflammation and 
improve cholesterol levels in the body.
Enjoying sardines — really
Fresh sardines may be difficult to find, but if you have a local fish market, 
you may want to buy some. Don’t buy more than what you need for a meal, 
though, because fresh sardines don’t last long, and they don’t freeze well, 
either.
Canned sardines are much more convenient and widely available. When you 
open the tin, you’ll find that the heads, gills, and internal organs have been 
removed. They’re usually packed in olive oil or water.
A popular way to serve sardines is to grill them and serve them on toast. 
Sardines can also be served cold with your favorite seasonings, a drizzle of 
olive oil, and a sprinkle of lemon juice.
 
Need more calcium and you don’t drink milk? Sardines are packed with cal-
cium as well as other minerals that help keep your bones strong and healthy.
Paying Tribute to Trout
Trout are related to salmon, so they have lots of omega-3 fats, but they have 
a much milder flavor. Trout is the perfect choice for people who don’t like 
the strong flavor of oily fish like salmon and sardines.
Trout can be found in both fresh water and salt water. There are several vari-
eties, with the rainbow trout being the best known. Other varieties include 
spotted trout, brown trout, and silver trout. Like other fish, trout varieties 
vary in terms of the taste, texture, and color of the meat, so you should give 
them all a try.
Tapping into the benefits of trout
This is one fish that definitely deserves to be called super. One 6-ounce trout 
fillet has 200 calories and serves as a good source of the following:

116
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
 
✓ Omega-3 fatty acids keep the heart healthy by reducing the amount of 
triglycerides and bad cholesterol (LDL) in the blood. They can also help 
reduce the amount of inflammation in the body, which is good for pre-
venting many diseases.
 
✓ Calcium helps reduce the risk of thinning of the bones called osteoporo-
sis. Calcium is also important for the contraction of muscles, including 
the heart.
 
✓ Magnesium can help regulate muscle contractions and is very valu-
able in reducing blood pressure and helping people who suffer from 
migraines.
 
✓ B vitamins are used for several functions of the body, such as regulating 
hormones and stabilizing blood sugar.
 
✓ Selenium is a great antioxidant, helping to prevent the inflammation 
that can lead to cancer and other diseases.
Buying and preparing trout
When you buy whole trout, look for fish that are clean and have bright eyes, 
bright red gills, and no fishy odor. Trout fillets should have a firm texture 
that springs back when pressed lightly with your finger, and the fish should 
have a fresh aroma.
Fresh raw trout can be refrigerated for a day or two or frozen for up to one 
month; however, it’s best to cook your fish right away.
Trout may be cooked as the whole fish, or in fillets with the skin intact — 
you don’t need to remove scales. Trout is typically prepared by pan-frying, 
poaching, grilling, steaming, or baking in an oven, usually with a little butter 
and lemon. Turn to Chapter 17 to see our recipe for Trout Almandine.
Trout is best cooked at high temperatures, and it cooks very quickly — often 
in as little as 3 minutes on each side when grilled or fried. It’s done when the 
flesh flakes easily. Take care not to overcook it.
 
Trout has a delicate flavor that can be altered by the fat used for cooking. If 
you pan-fry your trout, use a lightly flavored fat such as butter or peanut oil.
Opening a Can of Tempting Tuna
Tuna is an oily ocean fish that offers omega-3 fatty acids. It has a milder 
flavor than salmon, and it has been the most popular canned fish in the 
United States for many years.

Not only is tuna tasty and convenient, it’s also good for your health because 
it contains those omega-3 fats. Plus, tuna is a healthy source of protein and 
several vitamins and minerals.
Varieties of tuna include two dark red-fleshed tuna: bluefin, which is highly 
prized in Japan for sashimi, and yellowfin, which is less expensive but almost 
as tasty as bluefin. Skipjack tuna is the variety that you usually find in cans. 
It has the strongest flavor and the highest fat content. Albacore tuna has the 
mildest flavor — perfect for people who don’t care for the heavier taste of 
many oily fish — but albacore also has been found to have higher mercury 
levels than the other tunas.
Combining vitamins, minerals, 
and healthy fats
A typical can of light tuna chunks packed in water has about 200 calories and 
contains valuable amounts of the following nutrients:
 
✓ Magnesium can regulate muscle contractions, help relax muscles of the 
heart and blood vessels, and improve heart disease.
 
✓ Selenium is a powerful antioxidant that helps heal damaged cells, 
thereby preventing the development of many chronic diseases.
 
✓ Vitamin B3 (niacin) is very effective at increasing the levels of HDLs, or 
good cholesterol, in the blood. It also supports the conversion of carbo-
hydrates into sugar, which is then used for energy.
 
✓ Vitamin B12 is important for maintaining the cells of the nervous 
system. It has been found to be helpful for treating and preventing 
nerve-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
 
✓ Omega-3 fats increase good cholesterol and are a great natural anti-
inflammatory for the body.
Tuna, like other fish, is also a healthy source of protein, which your body 
needs for building muscles and organs. The minerals and B vitamins help 
various bodily systems function properly.
 
Choose low-sodium varieties of canned tuna if you need to watch your sodium 
intake. Fresh tuna steaks are not a significant source of sodium.
Bringing tuna to your table
Canned tuna is easy to find at your grocery store, where you’ll probably have 
a choice between light tuna or white tuna (albacore). Albacore is firmer and 
has a deliciously mild flavor compared to regular tuna.

Check your cans of tuna to see whether they wear the “dolphin-free” label. This 
voluntary label means that observers on the fishing vessels have ensured that 
no dolphins were killed or seriously injured during the tuna fishing season.
You can choose tuna packed in water or oil. We prefer tuna packed in water 
because the oil adds extra calories with no particular benefit. Low-sodium 
varieties are also available, and at least one brand offers flavorful yellowfin 
tuna in a can. Some brands offer tuna in pouches that are more convenient 
(and less messy) than canned tuna. (They also tend to be significantly more 
expensive, however.)
Fresh or frozen tuna steaks are available in many grocery stores, too. When 
you choose fresh tuna steaks, look for flesh that’s deep red in color, with a 
fresh aroma and firm texture. Fresh tuna steaks will keep in the refrigerator for a 
day or two, but they’re best when cooked the same day that they’re purchased.
Canned tuna is commonly used in sandwiches, salads, and casseroles. It’s 
delightful for use in sandwich wraps with dark greens, tomatoes, sprouts, and 
a little light dressing. In a salad, tuna adds healthy fats and protein and turns 
a simple salad into a meal. Check out our recipe for tuna wraps in Chapter 17 
and a salad recipe incorporating beans and soy in Chapter 18.
Raw tuna is popular in sushi and sashimi. Sushi-grade tuna is frozen almost 
as soon as it’s caught, so it retains its firm texture and fresh flavor.
The best methods for cooking tuna steaks are grilling or broiling, usually to a 
medium rare to medium temperature of 125 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
However you choose to enjoy tuna, just remember that the healthiest recipes 
don’t drench the tuna in mayonnaise or heavy sauces. Keep it light.
 
Don’t care for salmon? Tuna can be substituted for salmon in most recipes.
Tuna displaces sardines as favorite fish
Sardines were the canned fish of choice until 
1903, when Albert Halfill packed his empty sar-
dine cans with albacore, which was thought 
of as a nuisance fish. Today, Americans enjoy 
more than one billion pounds of canned or 
pouched tuna every year.

Going with the Grains 
and Legumes
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the best grains
▶ Loving your legumes
▶ Discovering sensational soy
H
umans have been eating grains for thousands of years. They’re easy to 
cultivate, transport, and store, plus they’re rich in nutrients and fiber 
that nourish the human body. It’s no coincidence that civilization began to 
flourish when humans learned how to grow grains. The most common grain 
is wheat, which is ground into flour and used in everything from bread and 
pasta to cookies and cakes.
Legumes include peas, peanuts, lentils, and dry beans. They’re high in pro-
tein, fiber, and phytochemicals, so they make a terrific substitute for red 
meats, which are high in saturated fats that can raise your cholesterol and 
increase inflammation.
While grains (especially whole grains) and legumes are good for you, a few in 
particular are super. In this chapter, we tell you about the superfood grains 
and legumes you need for your superfoods diet.
Packing in the Protein: Dry Beans
Dry beans are a staple food that has been traced back through different civi-
lizations. So what exactly are dry beans? They’re the group of legumes like 
pinto beans, black beans, and navy beans that come in a variety of colors and 
flavors, and they’re all superfoods. They have an amazing amount of fiber 

120
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
and protein, which is linked to improved health and reduced risk of several 
diseases.
The most popular dried beans are kidney, black, navy, pinto, and lima beans. 
According to the Unites States Department of Agriculture, red kidney beans 
are rated the highest in antioxidant function, even above blueberries. Pound 
for pound, dried beans give you filling, healthy meal options for an unbeliev-
ably low price. The fact that dried beans as a group makes our superfood list 
is a major statement about how nutritious this food group really is. We sug-
gest you eat dry beans three times each week.
Getting super healthy with super beans
The health benefits of dry beans are about the same across the board. In 
addition to about 14 to 16 grams of protein and 10 to 15 grams of fiber, 1 cup 
of cooked beans contains substantial amounts of magnesium, potassium, 
iron, folate, and vitamin K, and about 200 to 250 calories.
When you add dry beans to your superfoods diet, you improve your health by
 
✓ Keeping your heart healthy. Dry beans are a great source of soluble 
fiber that helps to lower cholesterol and the associated risk of choles-
terol plaque in your arteries.
 
✓ Stabilizing blood sugar. The fiber in dry beans helps keep your blood 
sugar from rising after a meal, which makes beans a great option for dia-
betics. Beans stabilize blood sugar by slowing the absorption and diges-
tion of carbohydrates.
 
✓ Reducing the risk of cancer. Studies have shown that women who eat 
more beans have a reduced risk of breast cancer. A study by research-
ers with the National Cancer Institute found that eating significant 
amounts of dry beans reduced recurrence of colon polyps and the over-
all risk of colon cancer.
 
✓ Healing your digestive system. Dry beans are a great source of insol-
uble fiber. The insoluble fiber reduces the risk of bowel disease and 
acts as a bulking agent to help prevent constipation and regulate bowel 
movements.
 
 While you can’t digest the fiber in dry beans, the friendly bacteria that 
live in your intestinal tract can. As a by-product, the bacteria produce 
short chain fatty acids that help to heal the walls of your digestive 
system, and, according to the Journal of Nutrition in 2001, reduce the risk 
of colon cancer.

121
 Chapter 8: Going with the Grains and Legumes
Selecting and preparing dry beans
Look for dry beans in the grocery store near the rice or canned vegetables. 
Dehydrated dry beans are available in bags or in the bulk area. Hydrated 
dry beans are also available near the canned vegetables and the “pork and 
beans.”
If you’re getting your beans in bulk, check out the bins and make sure there’s 
no moisture in the containers and there aren’t any obvious foreign objects or 
broken beans mixed in.
When you get the beans home, package them in bags or airtight containers 
and store them in a dry area at room temperature. You don’t want to keep 
them in the refrigerator or any damp area that might allow the beans to 
absorb water. If the beans get moist, they’ll spoil quickly.
When you’re ready to prepare the beans, place them in a colander and look 
for any debris. After going through the beans and getting rid of any abnormal-
looking ones or other non-edible substances, rinse them well to remove any 
dust.
Many people soak dry beans in water to reduce cooking time, but it isn’t 
an essential step. Soaking the beans causes them to expand to two to three 
times their original dry size. You can soak beans overnight (or at least six to 
eight hours) by keeping them in room-temperature water. You can also quick-
soak beans by boiling them in water for two to three minutes. Remove the 
beans from the heat and keep them covered for about one hour.
Cooking beans is easy. Add your dry beans (soaked or not) to a large pot 
and cover them with at least 2 to 3 inches of water. Cook the beans for one 
to three hours until tender. (Soaked beans take less than two hours to fully 
cook.) After cooking, they’re ready to serve as a side dish, or you can place 
them in the refrigerator to use later as an ingredient in another dish or to top 
a salad.
Canned beans are easy to use. Simply rinse the beans thoroughly in a colan-
der and heat them or add them to recipes.
Children occasionally sing about the connection between eating legumes and 
suffering from flatulence (intestinal gas). That’s because dry beans contain 
fiber that your body can’t digest, but the friendly bacteria that live in your 
colon can. The bacteria produce gas as a by-product. You don’t want to 
avoid legumes, though, because the advantages definitely outweigh the 
disadvantages.

122
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Loving Life with Luscious Lentils
Lentils are legumes that come in an assortment of colors, like red, yellow, 
and black. Lentils are easier to prepare than other legumes, and they’re very 
inexpensive. They’re a staple food in many countries, especially India. Fat-free, 
filling, and affordable, lentils make a great superfood option for everyone.
We suggest you add them to your regular rotation of superfoods by eating 
them twice each week.
Looking at what lentils have to offer
All colors of lentils provide you with fiber, protein, and folate, with almost 
no fat. Lentils are about 25 percent protein, and are second only to soybeans 
for the highest protein count in the legume family. One cup of cooked lentils 
packs 18 grams of protein.
A cup of cooked lentils contains 226 calories and a whopping 16 grams of 
fiber to keep you feeling full and satisfied between meals. A serving of lentils 
also gives you 90 percent of the daily recommended amount of the B vitamin 
folate and is a good source of iron, which you need to get oxygen to all the 
cells in your body.
When you eat lentils, you improve your health by
 
✓ Taking care of your heart. Lentils have a lot of fiber. Fiber binds to cho-
lesterol and removes it from the body in the stool. This not only reduces 
cholesterol levels but also decreases the risk of cholesterol plaques in 
your arteries.
 
 Lentils are also an excellent source of folate, which has been shown to 
reduce homocysteine levels (elevated homocysteine levels are associ-
ated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease).
 
✓ Preventing a birth defect. Pregnant women who are deficient in the B vita-
min folate are more likely to have babies with a birth defect of the spine and 
spinal cord called spina bifida. Lentils contain a large amount of folate.
 
✓ Weighing less. Lentils are a good source of complex carbohydrates, fiber, 
and protein that are digested slowly and keep you feeling full between meals. 
The combination of protein and fiber also helps to keep your blood sugar at a 
healthy level. This makes lentils a great carbohydrate option for diabetics or 
those with signs of insulin resistance (which often leads to diabetes).
 
✓ Reducing the risk of cancer. According to studies based on the 1989 
Nurses’ Health Study II (which included more than 90,000 women), 
women who ate more legumes such as lentils had a 24 percent reduced 
risk of breast cancer.

123
 Chapter 8: Going with the Grains and Legumes
 
✓ Keeping your digestive system regular. Lentils contain a large amount 
of both insoluble and soluble fiber. Insoluble fiber allows the stool to 
absorb water. The insoluble fiber reduces the risk of bowel disease and 
acts as a bulking agent to help prevent constipation.
Selecting and preparing lentils
You’ll find lentils in your grocery store. They come in several colors:
 
✓ Black lentils may also be called “Beluga Lentils.” They have a shiny 
black appearance when they’re cooked.
 
✓ White lentils are simply black lentils that have been cooked and had the 
skins removed, revealing the white legume with a firm texture.
 
✓ Brown lentils are also known as “Egyptian Lentils.” They’re the most 
popular variety and have the shortest cooking time.
 
✓ Green lentils are named “French Lentils” or “Continental Lentils.” 
They’re the largest and most expensive lentils, and are often used to top 
salads because they stay firmer when cooked.
 
✓ Yellow lentils are gold before cooking and turning a lighter yellow. They 
have a short cooking time.
 
✓ Red lentils have a sweeter flavor than other lentils and also take longer 
to cook.
Lentils are usually packaged in a dry form that stores very well — up to 12 
months. You can also buy canned lentils, but rinse them to remove some of 
the excess salt, which isn’t good for your blood pressure and your heart.
Unlike dry beans, lentils don’t have to be soaked before you cook them. Add 
1 cup of lentils to 3 cups of boiling water and cook, covered, for 20 to 30 min-
utes. The longer you cook them, the softer they become. Firmer lentils can be 
added to salads; softer lentils work best as a side dish.
Lentils can be served on salads, as a side dish, or as an ingredient in soups 
and stews. Try our Tomato and Lentil Stew in Chapter 17.
Starting the Day with 
Wholesome Oatmeal
Whole-grain oatmeal has warmed many bellies at breakfast, which may be 
the most important meal of the day. Whole grains (with the bran and husk 

124
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
intact) are high in fiber, so they’re digested more slowly than foods made up 
of mostly simple carbohydrates (sugars). Whole-grain fiber helps stabilize 
blood sugar and gives you sustained energy.
Oatmeal may be one of the oldest — and smartest — choices for a breakfast 
food. In fact, a Tufts University study found that children who ate oatmeal for 
breakfast scored higher on cognitive tests than kids who ate other breakfast 
cereals.
Oats have some super benefits to get you ready for the day. They’re packed 
with fiber and other nutrients that are important for your health. We suggest 
you eat oats at least two times per week.
Good carbs versus bad carbs
Grains and legumes are both rich in carbohy-
drates, which have gotten a bad rap over the 
last decade or so with the popularity of low-
carb diets. That’s unfortunate, because your 
body needs carbohydrates for energy — you 
just need to pick the good carbs and avoid the 
bad ones. So what’s the difference?
All carbohydrates are made up of chains of 
sugar molecules known as glucose, fructose, 
and galactose. Simple carbohydrates like table 
sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and honey con-
tain small chains of sugar — just two molecules 
long. Each one is a combination of fructose and 
glucose. It’s very easy for your digestive system 
to break these molecules apart, so you absorb 
them rapidly, which raises your blood sugar 
levels after you eat meals high in these ingre-
dients. Your body deals with the excess sugar 
by making insulin, which helps to remove the 
extra sugar from your blood and converts it to 
fat that’s stored somewhere on your body — 
usually your belly, butt, and thighs. Sugars like 
this are considered “bad” carbs because they 
add calories, but no other nutritional value. Plus, 
higher insulin levels in the blood are associated 
with obesity and an increased risk of cardiovas-
cular disease.
This doesn’t mean simple carbohydrates are 
always bad, though. Fruit is very healthful even 
though it contains fructose, because it’s also 
high in vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and 
fiber. The fiber in fruit helps to slow down the 
digestion and absorption of the sugars it con-
tains. Fruit and fruit juices are good carbs.
Complex carbohydrates are made up of longer 
chains of sugar molecules. Starch and cellulose 
are two types of complex carbohydrates found 
in the plant foods you eat. Your body digests 
starch a little more slowly than simple sugars, 
but it doesn’t digest cellulose at all. Cellulose 
is a main component of dietary fiber, so when 
starch and fiber are found in the same food, it 
takes longer for your body to digest and absorb 
the starch. This is good because now your 
body has a more sustained source of energy 
rather than the flood of sugar that rushes into 
the blood when you eat simple carbs. Complex 
carbohydrates combined with fiber are good 
carbs. Good carb sources include vegetables, 
whole grains, and legumes.
The difference between good carbs and bad 
carbs is big enough that the World Health 
Organization recognizes overconsumption of 
refined sugars as the leading factor driving the 
obesity epidemic around the world. So, although 
carbohydrates are important, try to get most of 
your daily consumption of carbohydrates from 
healthful food sources.

125
 Chapter 8: Going with the Grains and Legumes
Exploring the proven benefits of oats
One cup of cooked oats contains 6 grams of protein, 4 grams of fiber, and 166 
calories. The type of fiber oatmeal contains, beta-glucan, seems to be more 
effective than other types of fiber for lowering cholesterol.
Oats also contain polyphenols called avenanthramides, which, according to 
an article published in 2004 in the Journal of Nutrition, help reduce your risk 
of cardiovascular disease. These polyphenols fight inflammation and work 
with vitamin C to keep your blood fats at healthy levels.
Last but not least, oats are a good source of minerals like magnesium, manga-
nese, zinc, and selenium. These minerals are important for several chemical 
reactions that take place in your body, plus selenium is a powerful antioxi-
dant. Oats also contain lutein, a phytochemical related to vitamin A that’s 
important for normal vision.
When you eat oats, you improve your health by
 
✓ Lowering cholesterol. The beta-glucan helps lower levels of LDL, the 
bad cholesterol. Normally, your body excretes cholesterol into your 
digestive system and reabsorbs it to be used again. When you eat oat-
meal, the beta-glucan fiber binds with cholesterol in the intestinal tract 
and prevents it from being reabsorbed, thus lowering the cholesterol 
levels in your body. The bound cholesterol is simply eliminated through 
the stool.
 
 A large study published in 1993 in the Archives of Internal Medicine found 
that people who ate the most fiber every day had the greatest reduc-
tions in cholesterol, which also lowered their risk for cardiovascular 
problems.
 
✓ Decreasing cardiovascular disease. A study published in 2004 in the 
Archives of Internal Medicine showed that men who ate one bowl of oat-
meal a day reduced their risk of heart failure by 29 percent. Other stud-
ies have also indicated the reduction of high blood pressure with regular 
intake of oats.
 
✓ Strengthening your immune system. According to research published 
in 2004 in the journal Surgery, beta-glucan helps your white blood cells 
recognize and fight bacterial infection quickly.
 
✓ Stabilizing blood sugar. The fiber in oats slows down the absorption 
and metabolism of sugar, which reduces the need for insulin. Eating 
oatmeal may help diabetics reduce their blood sugar. The American 
Diabetes Association recommends you eat 20 to 35 grams of fiber every 
day. If you have diabetes, be sure to speak with your doctor about incor-
porating oatmeal into your diet.

126
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
 
To make your oatmeal even healthier, add a tablespoon of chia seeds or flax 
seeds to increase your fiber and add some healthy omega-3 fatty acids. This 
combination is even more effective in lowering cholesterol and improving 
heart health than oatmeal alone.
Buying and eating oatmeal
Oatmeal is made by removing the outer husk of oat grains while leaving the 
bran and germ intact, so the oats are still whole grains. The husked oats are 
known as groats and are minimally processed into the forms you see in the 
grocery store. You can choose from the following varieties:
 
✓ Steel-cut oats or Irish oats are chopped into small pieces by sharp steel 
blades. Steel-cut oats have a chewy texture and require a longer cooking 
time compared to rolled, quick, or instant oats.
 
✓ Rolled oats or old-fashioned oats are steamed and rolled into flattened 
flakes. They have a creamy texture and require less cooking time than 
steel-cut oats.
 
✓ Quick oats are processed in the same manner as rolled oats, but are 
rolled until they’re even thinner, so they require even less cooking time.
 
✓ Instant oats are precooked and rolled very thin so that they only need 
to be mixed with a hot liquid. They’re very convenient and are usually 
flavored with berries, syrup, brown sugar, and spices.
 
Read the labels if you buy instant oatmeal. Many brands of instant oatmeal 
contain excess sugar that you don’t need. Look for plain instant oatmeal from 
reputable brands such as Quaker, and add just a little honey, sweetener, or 
fresh fruit.
Uncooked oatmeal is best stored in an airtight container in a dry area of your 
kitchen. Oatmeal will keep well for about two months.
 
See Chapter 16 for our recipe for Banana Cream Oatmeal.
A Grain Out of the Ordinary: Quinoa
If you haven’t heard of quinoa before, you’re not alone. Quinoa (pronounced 
kee-noh-uh or keen-wah) is native to South America and, like the superfood 
chia (see Chapter 10), was used by Native Americans as an energizing food 
that could help their warriors stay strong in battles. The Incas considered 
quinoa a sacred food, and it was a staple of their diets for many years.

127
 Chapter 8: Going with the Grains and Legumes
Quinoa has a mild nutty flavor and crunchy texture. Quinoa is really a seed, 
but in cooking it’s treated like a grain. It’s related to spinach, which is a 
superfood as well (see Chapter 5). Quinoa may not be as popular as oats, 
wheat, or other well-known grains, but it’s a great superfood with many 
health benefits. We suggest your enjoy quinoa at least once each week.
Understanding quinoa’s superfood powers
Quinoa is a complete source of protein, which means it contains all the 
essential amino acids (which is important for vegetarians and vegans). One 
cup of cooked quinoa has 8 grams of protein — about twice as much protein 
as other cereal grains — plus a good amount of fiber (5 grams), all for just 
222 calories.
Quinoa is a good source of minerals, including magnesium, manganese, 
iron, and copper, plus B vitamins. All these nutrients are involved in chemi-
cal reactions that your body uses to make energy out of the foods you eat. 
Quinoa also has some healthful fats and potassium that are good for your 
heart and blood pressure.
By adding quinoa to your superfoods diet, you reap the following health 
benefits:
 
✓ Keeping your digestive system healthy: The large amount of insoluble 
fiber (fiber that doesn’t dissolve in water) in quinoa helps you have 
regular bowel movements. Insoluble fiber passes through the intestinal 
tract and helps move stool through the colon by adding bulk. Keeping 
the bowels regular reduces the risk of bloating, pain, and gas associated 
with irregular movements. It also reduces the risk of diverticulosis (small 
pouches that arise from weak spots in the intestine that can get inflamed 
or infected) and hemorrhoids.
 
✓ Reducing your risk of gallstones: Fiber has been found to reduce the 
secretion of bile acids, which are associated with gallstone formation. A 
large study published in 2004 in the American Journal of Gastroenterology 
indicated a 17 percent reduction in gallstones in the group of people 
who consumed the most insoluble fiber.
 
✓ Getting antioxidants and more energy: The minerals manganese and 
copper both help in the production of superoxide dismutase, an enzyme 
that helps the body fight off cellular damage throughout the body. This 
antioxidant activity helps prevent cardiovascular disease, cancer, and 
other inflammatory conditions. Quinoa is also rich in riboflavin (vitamin 
B2), which is necessary for energy production.
 
✓ Easing migraine headaches: The strong concentration of magnesium 
makes daily consumption of quinoa a good option for those with 

128
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
migraines. Magnesium helps prevent migraines by relaxing blood ves-
sels, which is the hallmark treatment for these vascular headaches.
 
✓ Making weight loss easier: The combination of protein and fiber in 
quinoa makes for a very filling food. A scientific study published in 2005 
in the British Journal of Nutrition found that quinoa had a high satisfac-
tion index compared to grains like wheat, so eating quinoa may help 
keep hunger pangs at bay.
Finding, keeping, and using quinoa
Although quinoa is relatively unknown, it really isn’t difficult to find. Some 
major grocery chains carry prepackaged quinoa in the same area where they 
sell oatmeal and other breakfast cereals; others carry it near the rice and 
couscous. Most natural foods stores carry quinoa in packages or in bulk. 
Food items that use quinoa, such as pasta, tortillas, crackers, cookies, and 
other baked items, also may be available.
Once you’ve opened a package of quinoa, keep it in an airtight container in a 
cool, dry place, where it will stay fresh for several weeks. Refrigerated quinoa 
will keep up to six months.
Just before cooking, rinse quinoa seeds thoroughly in a colander to remove 
any saponin residues that may impart a bitter taste. Saponin is a bitter cover-
ing that naturally repels insects. It’s removed during the processing of the 
seeds, but you should rinse your quinoa to remove any residues.
Add the quinoa to a pot of boiling water and simmer, covered, until the 
quinoa looks transparent — usually about 10 to 15 minutes. Use one part 
quinoa to two parts water — the seeds will expand. You can also cook quinoa 
in a rice cooker.
As the quinoa cooks, the germ that surrounds the grain pulls off and creates 
a small tail. A unique characteristic of quinoa is that when it’s cooked, the 
grain softens but the tail remains crunchy.
Serve hot quinoa just like oatmeal, with fresh berries, nuts, flax, or chia, and 
a little milk or cream (see Chapter 16 for a recipe). You can also serve quinoa 
as a side dish, similar to rice.
For a different flavor, cook quinoa in chicken broth. Add chopped cooked 
onions, mushrooms, or any other cooked vegetables to make a delicious and 
healthful pilaf.
 
You can grow quinoa sprouts at home in a container garden. Sprouted quinoa 
is quite tasty and can be used to season soups and salads. See Chapter 14 for 
more information on growing your own superfoods.

129
 Chapter 8: Going with the Grains and Legumes
Staying Healthy with Soy
Soy makes our superfoods list rather effortlessly. Soy has been consumed in 
Asian diets for thousands of years and is still a very popular food choice — 
in fact, it’s considered to be the most popular legume in the world. Soy is a 
complete protein source, containing all of the essential amino acids, and it 
has more protein per volume than meat.
Soy tastes delicious and has great nutritional value, and research has found 
numerous health benefits. It has plenty of vitamins and is full of antioxidants 
that reduce the risk of disease and fight inflammation.
Exploring the proven perks of soy
The health benefits of soy have been so well established that the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has approved this claim to be placed on labels of foods 
that contain soy as an ingredient: “Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that 
include 25 grams of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease.”
One cup of cooked soybeans delivers 29 grams of protein and 10 grams of 
fiber for 298 calories. The beans are nearly half protein, and soy flour has an 
even higher protein count.
Soybeans are not just protein packages; they’re also a good source of vita-
min E and the B vitamins: B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B6 (pyridoxine), and 
folate. Soy contains large amounts of calcium and iron, too.
Soybeans contain healthy omega-3 fatty acids with no cholesterol. Compared 
to other legumes, soybeans are a better source of essential fatty acids. Soybeans 
contain lecithin (a fat molecule that has high concentrations of the amino 
acids inositil and choline) and isoflavones (health-promoting compounds 
found in plants). Two isoflavones, daidzein and genisten are considered phy-
toestrogens (plant chemicals with estrogen-like activity).
 
If you go online, you can find many detractors of soy and soy foods. The main argu-
ment against the use of soy is that soy (like all legumes) contains phytates that 
reduce absorption of minerals like calcium, and trypsin inhibitors that reduce the 
availability of an important enzyme. While these so-called “anti-nutrients” are pres-
ent in raw soybeans and legumes, cooking and processing removes the phytates 
and trypsin inhibitors, rendering a very healthful and beneficial superfood.
When you eat soy, you improve your health by
 
✓ Lowering cholesterol. The fiber in soy helps to keep cholesterol in 
check. A study at Tufts University found that soy not only reduced LDL 
(bad cholesterol) but also increased the size of the LDL particles and 

130
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
raised HDL (good cholesterol) levels. Increasing the size of the LDL 
may be beneficial because smaller particles may cause more damage to 
blood vessel walls. The American Heart Association reports that isofla-
vones in soybeans exert cholesterol-lowering effects and also reduce 
blood vessel wall inflammation that may lead to heart disease.
 
✓ Preventing osteoporosis. Isoflavones have very weak estrogenic activ-
ity when compared to human estrogen (a major female hormone that’s 
present in both men and women), but researchers still feel that these 
phytochemicals help prevent bone destruction and may also help bone 
formation. This may explain why there’s a lower incidence of osteoporo-
sis in Asian countries.
 
✓ Reducing the risk of cancer. The estrogenic activity of the isoflavones 
may be of value in treating hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast, 
prostate, and endometrial cancer. The estrogenic activity is found to 
work similarly to some anti-cancer drugs. Studies have shown women 
who have the highest soy consumption have a lower incidence of endo-
metrial cancer. Research published in 2003 in the Journal of Nutrition 
suggests that the isoflavones in soy may work synergistically with 
indole-3-carbonyl (found in broccoli; see Chapter 5) to reduce the risk of 
estrogen-sensitive cancers. More studies are underway that will tell us 
more about how soy reduces the risk of cancer.
 
 Although there is promising research supporting soy’s role in cancer 
treatment and reduction, discuss using soy with your doctor first if you 
have had or are currently being treated for breast cancer.
 
✓ Protecting your prostate. Isoflavones in soy not only may help reduce 
the risk of prostate cancer, but evidence also shows that it may help 
fight enlargement of the prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 
which is a common problem for men. Regular consumption of soy may 
reduce the symptoms of urinary frequency and erectile dysfunction 
associated with an enlarged prostate.
 
✓ Improving nerve function. Soy contains large amounts of a fatty sub-
stance called lecithin, which is a major component of cell membranes. 
This may open doors to aid in the treatment of some neurological disor-
ders, such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and other conditions that affect 
the nervous system.
Selecting and serving soy
You may be able to find soybeans at your local grocery store near the canned 
vegetables or rice and dry beans. If you choose dehydrated soybeans, be sure 

131
 Chapter 8: Going with the Grains and Legumes
there’s no sign of moisture or broken packaging. Look for soy beverages in 
the dairy case or near other beverages. You’ll find tempeh and tofu in refrig-
erated cases.
Health foods stores usually have a much larger selection of soy, including soy 
flour and soy cheese. You may even find hot dogs and burgers made from 
soy, along with other vegetarian ingredients.
Dried soybeans can be stored in a dry, cool place for up to one year. To cook 
them, place 3 cups of water or broth in a pot for every 1 cup of dried soy-
beans. Soybeans take about 1½ hours to cook.
Eating cooked soybeans is the best way to get all of the nutritional goodness 
of soy; however, there are other ways to add soy to your superfoods diet. Soy 
can be found in beverages, snack bars, vegetarian foods, and protein powders.
Of the many options for soy consumption, the following are some of the most 
popular:
 
✓ Whole soybeans can be roasted and eaten plain or added to salads, 
soups, or other recipes. Edamame, a popular food and common appe-
tizer in certain restaurants, consists of soybeans that are boiled while 
still in the pods and then sprinkled with salt or a seasoning of choice.
 
✓ Soy beverages are a common choice for vegans and as a milk replacement 
for people who are lactose intolerant. Soy beverages are made from 
crushed, cooked soybeans. Not only do you get a higher amount of pro-
tein than from cow’s milk, you also gain the benefits of soy’s isoflavones.
 
✓ Tofu is one of the most popular meat substitutes and is especially popu-
lar among vegetarians and vegans. It has a cheese-like consistency with 
a very bland taste that takes up the flavors of sauces and vegetables that 
are combined with it. Tofu comes in a few different consistencies (soft 
to firm) that allow you to use it in a variety of ways, from smoothies to 
stir-fries.
 
✓ Tempeh is another soy product that’s easily incorporated into meals as 
a meat substitute. Tempeh is a fermented form of soy sold in flat, rectan-
gular pieces. It has more of a nutty flavor than tofu. Tempeh can be kept 
in the refrigerator for a week to ten days.
 
About 1 in every 200 people has an allergy to soy. Soy allergies are more 
common in children, but if you’re not sure whether you have an allergy, you 
should start taking soy slowly and pay attention to any changes or symptoms 
that may develop. Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if you feel 
that you’re having a reaction to soy.

Spicing It Up with Flavor 
(and Flavonoids)
In This Chapter
▶ Indulging in dark chocolate and red wine
▶ Pouring on the phenols in olive oil and green tea
▶ Adding some super spices
E
very successful diet allows room for some zesty flavors (and even a little 
indulgence now and then), so we flavor our superfoods diet with a few 
extra flavonoids (phytochemicals found in the pigments of plants that have 
health benefits). Of course, they’re all superfoods, too.
In this chapter, we show how dark chocolate and a little red wine can be 
good for you (really!), and how replacing a little of that coffee with some lus-
cious green tea can help your health. We include olive oil, which is good for 
your heart, and garlic, which has been used for many years in folk remedies. 
We also show you how to spice things up a bit with two sensational spices — 
turmeric and zesty cayenne pepper.
 
The key to enjoying most of the superfoods in this chapter is keeping your 
serving sizes small. One little piece of chocolate each day is good for you, but 
a lot of chocolate adds too much fat and too many calories, which is not only 
bad for your waistline, but also negates a lot of the benefits you get from the 
flavonoids.
Bringing the Heat with Cayenne Peppers
Cayenne peppers are red hot and spicy and will add a bit of zing to your 
superfoods diet. Cayenne peppers are related to bell peppers, jalapenos, and 
many other varieties of red and green peppers.

134
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
The amount of cayenne you use is a matter of taste. You may want to use up 
to a teaspoon of cayenne, depending on how spicy you like your foods. We 
suggest you add a little spice to your meals three or four times per week.
Fighting with fire
Capsaicin is the main compound in cayenne pepper that gives it its heat. 
Capsaicin heats up your body, too, because it’s a vasodilator, which means 
it increases blood flow by opening up your blood vessels. Cayenne peppers 
are rich in beta-carotene, the precursor to vitamin A, which is necessary 
for a healthy immune system, normal vision, and regular cell reproduction. 
Cayenne peppers also contain lutein and zeaxanthin, powerful antioxidants 
that help protect your vision and your cardiovascular system.
Cayenne pepper acts as all of the following when added to foods:
 
✓ A pain fighter: Capsaicin helps to relieve pain when you eat it or when 
you rub it into the skin over a painful part of your body. Capsaicin 
reduces the amount of substance P, a neurochemical associated with 
inflammation. When substance P is diminished, so is pain. Reducing 
inflammation is also good for your heart and cardiovascular system.
 
✓ A congestion reliever: Capsaicin stimulates drainage of the mucous 
membranes in your nasal passages, providing an effect similar to that of 
some cold medications.
 
✓ A weight controller: According to research published in 2006 in the 
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, cayenne pepper revs up your metab-
olism and increases your body’s ability to burn calories. Cayenne peppers 
also help control insulin levels, which may help to control diabetes.
Selecting, handling, and 
serving cayenne peppers
You can buy whole, fresh, or dried cayenne peppers in the produce aisle of 
your local grocery store, or you can choose powdered cayenne pepper, which 
you’ll find in the herb and spice aisle. You’re also likely to see a few varieties of 
cayenne pepper sauce, which is a combination of red pepper and vinegar.
Fresh cayenne peppers are sometimes used in recipes. To prepare a pepper, 
just remove the stem, slice it open, and remove the seeds inside.
 
When you handle fresh peppers, be sure to wear gloves and don’t touch your 
eyes — the capsaicin will sting and irritate them. When you’re finished, wash 
your hands and cooking utensils thoroughly. Rinsing your hands with milk 
also helps to reduce the burning sensation.

135
 Chapter 9: Spicing It Up with Flavor (and Flavonoids)
Remember that cayenne is hot, so a little bit is all you need for recipes and 
for seasoning.
 
Try a dash of red pepper sauce on our vegetable omelets (see Chapter 16) or 
our salmon cakes (see Chapter 19).
Indulging in Decadent Dark Chocolate
We spend a lot of time telling people to avoid candy, so it’s a lot of fun to be 
able to recommend chocolate as a superfood. There is one stipulation — it 
has to be dark chocolate, because it contains more cocoa than the typical 
milk chocolate candy bar. Cocoa is rich in natural compounds that are pow-
erful enough to make dark chocolate a superfood.
Cocoa is made from seeds harvested from the pods of cacao trees. The seeds 
are processed into cocoa powder, which finds its way into a wide range 
of sweet treats ranging from candy bars to cakes, cookies, truffles, and ice 
cream sundaes. Most of these foods are high in fat, sugar, and calories, but, if 
you’re careful, you can enjoy chocolate treats and improve your health.
We recommend that you eat 1 to 2 ounces of dark chocolate every day, but 
not more. Too much chocolate adds fats and sugar that may contribute to 
unwanted weight gain.
Getting a boost from cocoa
Cocoa is rich in flavonoids, especially one called epicatechin. In general, fla-
vonoids reduce inflammation and protect the cells in your body from damage.
One ounce of dark chocolate (about 60 to 70 percent cocoa) has about 160 
calories; is rich in magnesium, a mineral that your body needs for normal 
nerve and muscle function; and provides 5 percent of your daily need of 
selenium, a mineral that works as an antioxidant. An article published in 
the Journal of American Dietetic Association in 1999 states that magnesium 
deficiency may have a connection to chocolate cravings. (One ounce of dark 
chocolate has 55 milligrams of magnesium — more than two slices of whole- 
grain bread and about 10 percent of what you need each day.) Chocolate 
cravings may also involve some neurotransmitters (brain chemicals) like 
serotonin that lead to a feeling of well-being. Dark chocolate contains tryp-
tophan, an amino acid that your body uses to produce serotonin. Chocolate 
also contains the stimulants caffeine and theobromine, as well as phenoleth-
ylamine, a biochemical that mimics the feeling of being in love.
When you eat small amounts of dark chocolate every day, you partake of 
cocoa’s health attributes:

136
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
 
✓ Improving vascular health: Several studies point out the vascular ben-
efits of the flavonoids in dark chocolate. Research published in 2004 in 
the Journal of the American College of Nutrition found that eating about 
11/2 ounces of Dove dark chocolate every day improved blood vessel 
function. A 2007 German study published in The Journal of the American 
Medical Association discovered eating one dark Hershey’s Kiss a day was 
effective for lowering blood pressure.
 
 You need healthy blood vessels to let blood flow to your brain, your 
heart, and, of course, the rest of your body. Eating a small amount of 
dark chocolate daily reduces your risk of atherosclerosis (thickening of 
the arteries), a big risk factor for heart disease and stroke, and helps 
keep your blood pressure at a healthy level.
 
✓ Curbing insulin resistance: The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 
reported in 2005 that flavonoids in dark chocolate help to improve insu-
lin resistance, an inability of the body to respond properly to insulin, 
thereby leading to diabetes. The flavonoids’ effect on blood vessels may 
be very helpful for diabetic patients, because vascular problems are a 
common complication with diabetes.
 
✓ Having a healthier pregnancy. A 2008 study from Yale University found 
that pregnant women who ate more chocolate and had higher levels of 
theobromine (a chemical in chocolate that’s similar to caffeine) in their 
systems were less likely to suffer from pre-eclampsia, a condition that 
effects pregnant women who have high blood pressure.
Choosing the best dark chocolate
You can buy dark chocolate almost anywhere, from local convenience 
stores and vending machines to exclusive gourmet chocolate shops. Quality 
and price vary widely. Look for dark chocolate that contains more than 
65 percent cocoa: The flavonoids are in the cocoa, not the sugar or fat that 
accompanies them, so the higher the cocoa content, the better. Avoid Dutch-
processed cocoa, however (see the nearby sidebar to find out why).
The easiest way to enjoy dark chocolate is to buy dark chocolate bars. They 
vary in size, ranging from 1 ounce to 3 ounces. Just eat one smaller bar, or 
break the larger bars into smaller pieces. Chocolate should be stored in a 
dark, dry place at about 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Chocolate that is still 
wrapped will last up to a year at this temperature. If you live in a warm cli-
mate, keep your chocolate in the refrigerator. Be sure to wrap the chocolate 
in foil or plastic to protect it from food odors. Let it warm up to room tem-
perature before eating it. Note that some chocolate candies, such as truffles, 
may only last up to a month at room temperature.
 
Any dark chocolate bar that is not Dutch-processed (read the label) offers 
plenty of flavonoids; however, you also can buy CocoaVia bars, which contain 
soy products (see Chapter 8) that are good for heart health.

137
 Chapter 9: Spicing It Up with Flavor (and Flavonoids)
Some research has found that sugar-free dark chocolate may be more effec-
tive than sugar-sweetened dark chocolate. Unsweetened chocolate is very 
bitter, but you may find dark chocolate sweetened with artificial sweeteners, 
such as sucralose.
Livening Up Foods with a Clove of Garlic
Pungent, cream-colored cloves of garlic add more than flavor to your foods; 
they also bring good health to you and your family. Garlic has been used as 
medicine for a very long time to fight infections and to ward off evil spirits 
(not to mention vampires). Today, garlic is used to reduce cholesterol and 
prevent cancer and as an anti-microbial agent.
Garlic has a distinctive aroma and flavor due to a compound called allicin, 
which is released when the clove is sliced or crushed. Garlic is used in many 
recipes, and although the heat from cooking reduces some of the active com-
pounds in garlic, the garlic retains most of its health benefits.
We suggest you eat one clove of garlic every day, or take garlic supplements 
two or three times each week.
Gauging garlic’s health benefits
The main active compounds in garlic are allicin and other sulfur-containing 
compounds. Garlic also contains some B complex vitamins and selenium, 
which are important for many chemical reactions in your body. Selenium is 
a mineral that works like an antioxidant. Garlic is also very low in calories — 
one clove has only 4 calories.
The pitfalls of Dutch-processed cocoa
Dutch-processed cocoa is treated with an 
alkaline substance to reduce the natural acid-
ity and bitterness of cocoa. Unfortunately, 
this process also destroys cocoa’s healthful 
flavonoids. Many people prefer the taste of 
Dutch-processed cocoa, which has a smoother, 
milder flavor that works well for many recipes. 
It’s important to note, however, that Dutch-
processed cocoa has a neutral pH (rather than 
acidic), which can throw off the chemical bal-
ance of some baked good recipes: They may 
not rise properly, unless the recipe also calls 
for baking soda.

138
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
You can rely on garlic to assist with the following:
 
✓ Lowering blood pressure: A study published in 2008 in the Annals of 
Pharmacotherapy determined that garlic reduces high blood pressure, 
which is a risk factor for heart disease and strokes.
 
✓ Preventing cancer: Eating garlic appears to increase antioxidant activ-
ity, according to research published in 2008 in the journal Gerontology. 
Boosting antioxidants may help to prevent cancer and help you live longer.
 
✓ Fighting microbes: Garlic inhibits a variety of fungi, viruses, and bacte-
ria and has been used as an anti-microbial for thousands of years. The 
Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy reported in 2003 that garlic inhib-
its the growth of the bacteria that cause methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA), a type of antibiotic-resistant infection, in mice. Garlic also 
inhibits candida albicans, a common cause of yeast infections.
 
✓ Promoting digestive health: Garlic contains the prebiotic compound 
fructose oligosaccharide (FOS). Prebiotics support the growth of friendly 
bacteria that reside in the intestinal tract. These bacteria are necessary 
for making vitamin K and for normal, healthy digestion.
Selecting, keeping, and using garlic
Fresh garlic is available in the produce section of your grocery store. Garlic is 
also often available pre-chopped, in jars or bottles.
To roast garlic, just remove the outermost layer of papery covering and place 
the bulb in a baking dish. Drizzle some olive oil on top of the bulb, cover the 
baking dish with aluminum foil, and bake in an oven heated to 375 degrees 
Fahrenheit for about one hour. Serve the roasted garlic with whole-grain bread.
To prepare garlic for cooking, simply break the cloves you need off the bulb. 
To make peeling the papery covering off the cloves easier, heat the cloves in 
your microwave on high for about ten seconds or so. This loosens the cover-
ing. Then chop the peeled cloves with a knife or a garlic press, a device that 
squeezes the clove through several small holes.
 
You get the most health benefits from fresh garlic cloves that you chop or 
crush just before you add them to your recipes. According to research pub-
lished in 2008 in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, the amount of 
allicin decreases rapidly. In fact, garlic preserved in oil lost half of its allicin 
content in just six hours. Garlic stored in water fared better, but half of the 
allicin disappeared within six days.
Pre-chopped garlic is not as powerful as fresh garlic; however, it retains 
much of its health benefit and many people like the convenience. If you 
choose pre-chopped garlic, buy it in small jars and store the garlic in the 
refrigerator after it has been opened.

139
 Chapter 9: Spicing It Up with Flavor (and Flavonoids)
Garlic supplements, such as Garlique, are available. Many people prefer 
taking supplements to avoid the after-effect of “garlic breath.” The garlic odor 
can be diminished by using an enteric coating on the capsules, which ensures 
the garlic is released in the small intestine instead of the stomach.
Brewing Up a Cup of Green Tea
Humans have been brewing tea for a very long time — perhaps as many as 
500,000 years, according to archeological evidence. One tea in particular — 
green tea — makes our superfoods list. You may be more familiar with the 
many popular varieties of black tea that are available in nearly every restau-
rant or grocery store, such as orange pekoe and Earl Grey. These black teas 
are very popular in the United States, but in Asian countries, green tea is 
actually preferred. Green tea contains more polyphenols, which are the anti-
oxidants that protect your body and promote good health.
We suggest you drink 2 or 3 cups of green tea four or five days each week, 
perhaps in place of your regular cup of coffee.
Catching some catechins
Green teas contain several types of catechins (flavonoids) that appear to pro-
tect your body from a variety of cancers. They also keep your blood vessels 
healthy. Green tea also contains caffeine, along with theobromine and theo-
phylline, which act as stimulants, although coffee contains much more caffeine. 
If you prefer to avoid caffeine, green tea is available in decaffeinated form.
Green, black, white, or oolong tea?
All four of these types of tea are made from the 
leaves of the same plant, Camellia sinensis. 
The difference is in how they’re processed. 
The leaves are harvested at the same time for 
green, black, and oolong teas; however, green 
tea leaves are dried immediately, whereas the 
leaves for black and oolong teas are fermented 
before drying. Fermentation reduces the amount 
of polyphenols found in the tea, so that’s why 
green tea is considered the healthiest of the 
teas. Oolong tea isn’t fermented as long as 
black tea, so oolong has more antioxidants than 
black tea, which has the least. A fourth version, 
called white tea, is harvested while the leaves 
are immature. Like green tea, white tea is pro-
cessed immediately without fermentation, and, 
in fact, white tea may have more antioxidants 
than green tea. However, it’s more expensive 
and more difficult to find in stores.

140
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a catechin that has received the most 
attention in research studies because it appears to have several biological 
actions, including anti-cancer activity and blood pressure reduction. It also 
may help you burn calories.
Green tea is beneficial in a host of health endeavors:
 
✓ Preventing breast cancer: Research involving the dietary patterns of 
large groups of people showed lower rates of cancer in people who drank 
green tea every day. An article in Breast Cancer Research and Treatment 
reported in 2008 that green tea stops cancer cells by blocking angiogene-
sis, which is the growth of new blood vessels that feed a cancerous tumor.
 
✓ Reducing the risk of ovarian cancer: The Archives of Internal Medicine 
published research in 2005 showing the more tea (both green and black) 
women drank every day, the lower their risk of ovarian cancer. EGCG is 
thought to be the main catechin responsible for preventing this type of 
cancer.
 
✓ Decreasing prostate cancer: Catechins stopped the growth of prostate 
cancer cells in lab research. Australian studies of large groups of people 
showed that drinking green tea appears to protect men against prostate 
cancer.
 
✓ Protecting your cardiovascular system: The journal Nutrition confirmed 
in 2005 that green tea extracts reduce inflammation, blood pressure, and 
LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) in about three weeks. Green tea 
also keeps blood vessels healthy.
 
✓ Preventing diabetes: Catechins improve blood sugar control. The jour-
nal Obesity published research in 2008 that found diabetics who drank 
green tea had lower hemoglobin A1C levels (a blood test that measures 
blood sugar). Drinking green tea also keeps blood vessels healthy, which 
is very important for diabetics.
 
✓ Aiding weight loss: The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition explained 
in 2008 that the catechins in green tea help burn more fat calories during 
moderate exercise. Drinking green tea (or taking green tea extract) before 
working out may improve your odds of losing weight and keeping it off.
Buying and brewing green tea
You can find green tea online and in most grocery stores. Some tea and coffee 
shops sell loose green tea, or you can purchase it in regular tea bags.
The easiest way to brew green tea is to buy tea bags that already contain 
the perfect amount of tea leaves to make 1 cup of tea. To maximize the 

141
 Chapter 9: Spicing It Up with Flavor (and Flavonoids)
amounts of polyphenols, let the tea bag steep in very hot water for two to five 
minutes.
Some people prefer loose tea over bags. To brew loose-leaf tea, you need a 
device for straining the leaves. You can use a tea ball, a mesh metal ball that 
you fill with tea leaves and place into a cup of hot water. Tea infusers that 
look like small baskets can also hold your tea in the water until it’s brewed to 
your liking.
Green tea extract is available as a dietary supplement if you’d prefer not to 
drink tea. Be sure to follow the directions on the product label.
 
According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, green tea may pos-
sibly interact with some types of chemotherapy. If you’re undergoing any form 
of treatment for cancer, speak with your doctor before drinking green tea or 
taking supplemental green tea extracts.
Pouring It On! Olive Oil
Olive oil is one of the main features of the Mediterranean diet, which appears 
to be one of the best diets for reduction of heart disease risk and for living 
longer. Olive oil contains oleic acid (an omega-9 monounsaturated fat that’s 
good for your health), and virgin and extra-virgin olive oils also contain phy-
tochemical antioxidants.
Olives are harvested and taken immediately to mills, where they’re cleaned 
and ground into paste. The oil is separated from the solids (the pomace) 
and bottled. Oil pressed in this manner is called virgin or extra virgin olive oil 
(depending on the oleic acid content). Virgin and extra virgin olive oils are 
rich in polyphenols. Olive oil that is refined has fewer polyphenols than virgin 
or extra virgin olive oils.
Because olive oil is so good for you and so easy to use, we suggest you con-
sume 2 tablespoons of olive oil every day, preferably in place of saturated 
animal fats. Two tablespoons may not seem like much, but oils are high in 
calories, so a little bit goes a long way.
Reaping the benefits of olive oil
Two tablespoons of olive oil supply 239 calories plus vitamins E and K, mono-
unsaturated fats, and polyphenols, such as tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol. These 

142
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
polyphenols, in addition to oleic acid, elevate olive oil from just another 
healthy food to superfood status.
Olive oil has a positive impact on cholesterol and can help prevent heart 
disease when you use it to replace unhealthy saturated fats (from fatty red 
meats and high-fat dairy products, for example). Other sources of oleic acid 
include canola oil and avocados.
Adding a little olive oil to your diet imparts several important benefits.
 
✓ Protecting your heart: The monounsaturated fats and polyphenols in 
olive oil help to lower your total cholesterol while raising the good HDL 
cholesterol. Olive oil also helps to lower blood pressure and keeps your 
arteries healthy by decreasing inflammation.
 
✓ Preventing cancer: The polyphenols in olive oil may help to reduce the 
risk of breast cancer by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, according 
to research published in 2008 in the International Journal of Molecular 
Medicine. Research published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food 
Chemistry in 2007 discovered that those same polyphenols kill H. pylori 
in the lab. H. pylori is the bacteria that’s been linked to peptic ulcers 
and stomach cancer.
 
✓ Longevity: According to a study published in 2000 in the British Journal 
of Nutrition, people who follow a Mediterranean type of diet rich in olive 
oil, poultry, and vegetables tend to live longer compared to people who 
eat more pasta and red meat.
A super diet — The Mediterranean Diet
The Mediterranean Diet was introduced in 
1993 by the Oldways Preservation & Exchange 
Trust, Harvard School of Public Health, and the 
World Health Organization. It’s based on the 
traditional foods eaten by people living in the 
Mediterranean region, especially Greece and 
Italy. The Mediterranean diet features olive oil, 
lots of fish and seafood, fresh fruits and veg-
etables, legumes, nuts, and seeds. The diet 
also includes moderate consumption of whole 
grains, red wine, and dairy, but is very low in the 
consumption of red meat.
Although the inhabitants of this region of the 
Mediterranean eat diets high in fat, they have 
much lower rates of cardiovascular disease 
and cancer than people who eat high-fat diets 
in other parts of the world. This is unusual, 
because most high-fat diets are correlated 
with a higher incidence of disease and death. 
The difference could be due in part to the use of 
omega-9-rich olive oil and the large amounts of 
omega-3 fatty acids from fish and seafood.
You can re-create a Mediterranean diet by 
using olive oil in place of other fats and oils, 
increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables 
(like our superfoods in Chapters 4 and 5), and 
eating more fish (see Chapter 7). You should 
reduce your consumption of red meat and 
highly processed foods and sweets; however, 
it’s okay to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner.

143
 Chapter 9: Spicing It Up with Flavor (and Flavonoids)
Selecting, storing, and pouring olive oil
Olive oil is available in every market and grocery store. Olive oils vary in price, 
from refined olive oil, which is the least expensive, to delicately flavored (but not 
delicately priced) olive oils found in exclusive gourmet shops. Extra virgin olive 
oils are more expensive than virgin or refined olive oils, but they’re worth the 
cost. In fact, they have a dedicated following with aficionados, just like wines do.
 
If you’re fortunate enough to have a gourmet food shop in your area, such as 
a Dean & Deluca, check to see whether they hold olive oil tastings. You’ll be 
able to discover more about the subtle differences among the different variet-
ies and find out which oils pair best with your favorite foods.
Store olive oil in a dark glass bottle or stainless steel container in a cool area, 
away from heat sources. You can also store your olive oil in the refrigerator; 
however, it may alter the flavor of extra virgin olive oil.
You can use olive oil for salad dressings, sauces, and cooking a variety of 
savory dishes. Here are some ideas:
 
✓ Extra virgin olive oil loses flavor when cooked, so it’s better for making 
dressings or for using on top of cooked foods.
 
✓ Replace butter with olive oil, or blend the two into a spread that has less 
saturated fat than butter alone.
 
✓ Dip whole-grain bread in olive oil mixed with a little parmesan cheese 
and red pepper.
 
✓ Dress your salads with extra-virgin olive oil and a bit of balsamic vinegar.
 
✓ Top your cooked vegetables with a drizzle of olive oil and lemon juice.
 
✓ Make pesto (see Chapter 17) and serve with pasta.
Some people even choose to bake their cookies and cakes with olive oil, 
although others may not associate the flavor of olive oil with sweets.
Sipping a Small Glass of Red Wine
Enjoying a glass of red wine with your dinner may be good for your heart. 
Red wine contains flavonoids called catechins, a substance called resveratrol, 
and gallic acid, which are all antioxidants. Drinking red wine (in moderation) 
may be one of the reasons for the “French paradox,” which is the observation 
of good heart health among the French despite their rich, high-fat diet.

144
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
 
Don’t start drinking wine if you normally don’t drink alcohol or if you have 
problems with alcohol dependency, are under age, or are pregnant or nursing. 
You can find other superfood beverages such as fruit juices (see Chapter 4) 
or green tea (see the section “Brewing Up a Cup of Green Tea” earlier in this 
chapter). If you do drink wine, remember that more is not better. One serving 
of wine is 5 ounces, or little more than 1/2 cup. While several health benefits 
are associated with enjoying small amounts of alcohol, there are no health 
benefits (and some risks) in having more than one or two drinks each day.
If you drink alcohol already, we suggest that you enjoy one 5-ounce glass of 
wine daily. The American Heart Association recommends one glass a day for 
women and up to two glasses a day for men. You may also choose to drink 
nonalcoholic red wine.
More than truth in red wine
One 5-ounce serving of red wine has 125 calories. Red wine also contains 
potassium, which is good for your heart and your muscles, plus fluoride for 
your teeth. You can enjoy a glass of red wine with the knowledge that you are
 
✓ Improving cardiovascular health. The flavonoids and resveratrol in 
wine keep your blood vessels healthy and prevent platelets from stick-
ing together to form blood clots. According to the Mayo Clinic, drinking 
red wine may prevent heart attacks and strokes. Red wine also helps to 
increase your HDL cholesterol (the good kind).
 
✓ Preventing cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, the anti-
oxidants in red wine may help to prevent cellular damage that results in 
cancer. In addition, resveratrol appears to inhibit the growth of cancer-
ous cells in the lab.
 
✓ Living longer. The antioxidants that prevent cancer and heart disease 
may lead to living a longer life. A study published in 2008 in the Journal 
of Agricultural and Food Chemistry states that drinking red wine with 
red meat actually reduces the harmful effects of eating red meat. Other 
studies have found a correlation between drinking one or two alcoholic 
drinks each day and living longer.
Selecting and serving red wines
There are several types of red wine. The most common types include caber-
net sauvignon, pinot noir, merlot, syrah (or shiraz), chianti, malbec, and zin-
fandel. Red wine is available at liquor stores and wine shops, some grocery 
stores, and many restaurants.

 Chapter 9: Spicing It Up with Flavor (and Flavonoids)
Antioxidants are found in the skins of red grapes, and the alcohol produced 
during fermentation draws the antioxidants out of the skins. Deeper red 
wines have a much higher concentration than the lighter rose wines because 
the grape skins are removed during the process of making lighter wines.
If you don’t know which wine you like best, check out a local wine shop to 
see when they have wine tastings or ask for advice on choosing wine. You 
can also refer to Wine for Dummies, 4th Edition, by Ed McCarthy and Mary 
Ewing-Mulligan (Wiley) for more information.
All red wines are good sources of flavonoids and resveratrol, even wines that 
have had the alcohol removed. Resveratrol is also found in other foods, such 
as peanuts, and you can get some resveratrol when you eat grapes or drink 
grape juice.
You can enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, or you can use red wine as an 
ingredient in many dishes (the alcohol will usually be cooked away by heat, 
but the heat won’t damage the resveratrol). Our tomato and lentil stew (see 
Chapter 17) contains red wine as one of the ingredients.
Relieving Pain with Turmeric
Turmeric is a golden yellow powder that’s used in curry dishes from India 
and sometimes as a yellow food coloring. The powder is ground from rhi-
zomes (a portion of plant stem that grows underground) of the Curcuma 
longa, which is in the same family as ginger.
Besides adding flavor to food, turmeric helps to reduce pain and may slow 
down the progress of Alzheimer’s disease. It has been used in India as an 
Aruvedic medicine, which is a form of traditional medicine. One serving of 
turmeric is about 1/4 teaspoon. We suggest you use this seasoning twice a week.
Taking advantage of turmeric
Turmeric contains curcumin, which is a polyphenol, antioxidant, and anti-
inflammatory agent. Using turmeric or curcumin capsules may help to 
improve your health by providing the following benefits:
 
✓ Battling autoimmune diseases: Curcumin affects the immune system 
and inhibits some diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid 
arthritis, by regulating signaling mechanisms called cytokines. According 
to the Journal of Clinical Immunology in 2007, these regulating mechanisms 

146
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
are the reason curcumin is beneficial for people with diabetes, arthritis, 
asthma, allergies, and cancer.
 
✓ Providing pain relief: Curcumin functions as a COX-2 inhibitor, just 
like some prescription pain medications, but with fewer side effects. 
Research in Israel suggests that curcumin makes prescription COX-2 
inhibitors more effective at lower doses, thus also reducing side effects.
 
 Curcumin reduces pain by fighting inflammation. Curcumin has been 
studied for pain relief in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.
 
✓ Fighting cancer: The polyphenols in turmeric have anti-cancer proper-
ties due to their ability to regulate cytokine. Biochemical Pharmacology 
reported in 2007 that curcumin also slows the growth of breast cancer 
cells in a laboratory setting.
 
✓ Aiding memory: Turmeric may help fight Alzheimer’s disease due to the 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin. A study in the 
American Journal of Epidemiology reported in 2006 that elderly Asians 
who ate curry regularly were less likely to suffer from Alzheimer’s dis-
ease than Asians who rarely or never ate curry.
 
While eating turmeric as a seasoning is perfectly safe, please speak with your 
doctor if you want to take curcumin as a dietary supplement, because it may 
have an impact on blood clotting and blood sugar control.
Using turmeric
You can buy turmeric alone or in curry powder in the baking section of 
your grocery store. Curry powders are popular in Asian and Indian cooking. 
Different curries vary in ingredients. All curries are well-seasoned, and some 
are downright hot. Store curry powder in an air-tight container at room tem-
perature for up to two months.
 
Try sprinkling some curry powder instead of salt and pepper on your poultry, 
rice, and vegetable dishes.
Turmeric is the ingredient in mustard that gives it its yellow color, and it’s 
a component of Worcestershire sauce. Turmeric goes well with chicken, 
turkey, and vegetable dishes.

Chapter 10
Exploring Exotic Superfoods
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing the exotic superfoods
▶ Getting the exotic superfoods into your diet
▶ Knowing where to find them
T
he word exotic refers to something that’s different, unusual, or foreign. 
Our exotic superfoods are well-known in other parts of the world and 
include fruits, grains, grasses, and marine life that all pack a powerful punch 
when it comes to helping your body. These exotic superfoods are all great 
examples of why we call certain foods super.
In the world of superfoods, being exotic also means being a little harder to 
find. Some of our exotic foods may not be available on the shelves of your 
favorite grocery store — yet. However, with time, these exotic superfoods 
will become better known, and, most likely, more readily available.
In this chapter, we introduce you to some superfoods that you may never have 
seen in the grocery store, or even heard of. We show you what makes them 
superfoods, where to find them, and how to add them to your superfoods diet.
 
The foods in this chapter tend to be harder to find and often are fairly expen-
sive. So, although we offer recommendations for regular consumption, you 
can always treat these foods as extras — something you indulge in occasion-
ally as part of your overall superfoods regimen.
South America’s Açaí
Açaí berries (pronounced ah-sigh-ee) are grown on palm trees in the Amazon 
rainforest of northern Brazil. The trunks of these palm trees grow in groups 
and can reach up to 80 feet tall. The Açaí berries hang down in clusters from 
the branches, and each tree can produce a large amount of berries.

148
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
An açaí berry is dark purple to almost black in color and is about the size of 
a blueberry (see Figure 10-1). Brazilians use the berries not only as fruit, but 
also for juice, wine, and as an ingredient in desserts. The berries are usually 
used soon after picking.

Fighting cancer and inflammation
Like all of our other superfood berries, açaí berries are rich in nutrients and 
antioxidants that can help fight the inflammation that’s associated with many 
chronic diseases. A few recent studies have shown that extracts from açaí 
berries may destroy cancer cells, particularly those associated with leukemia. 
The beautiful dark pigments that color the açaí berries contain flavonoids called 
anthocyanins. One serving of açaí juice contains large amounts of anthocyanins 
and plant sterols, as well as calcium, vitamin A, amino acids, and oleic acid.
One ounce of açaí pulp has 15 calories per ounce and the powder has 19 calo-
ries per 3-gram scoop. Açaí juice is often blended with other juices, so 1 cup 
of juice usually has from 100 to 150 calories.
Adding açaí berries to your diet can aid you in the following endeavors:
 
✓ Fighting leukemia. A study done by the University of Florida and pub-
lished in the January 2008 Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry 
found that extracts of the açaí berry destroyed human cancer cells 
grown in a lab.
 
 Studies on humans will have to follow to give more concrete evidence, 
but this is a positive start.

149
 Chapter 10: Exploring Exotic Superfoods
 
✓ Reducing inflammation. A study published in the 2006 Journal of Agricultural 
and Food Chemicals found açaí juice contained several anthocyanins that 
have powerful antioxidant properties, which, along with oleic acids, may 
reduce inflammation associated with chronic diseases.
 
 Açaí berries also inhibit COX enzymes, which means drinking açaí juice 
may have an effect similar to that of aspirin in relieving chronic pain.
 
✓ Taking care of your heart. Açaí pulp contains lots of fiber that helps 
keep your digestive system healthy and reduces cholesterol. The oleic 
acid and beta-sitosterol found in açaí pulp are also good for healthy 
cholesterol levels. Add in the anti-inflammatory effects mentioned in the 
preceding bullet, and this berry is great for cardiovascular health.
Finding açaí berries
Açaí berries are most often sold as juice or in a pulp or purée because the 
berries are too delicate to ship fresh. Shopping for açaí berries is easiest to 
do online; however, you may find açaí juice, pulp, and supplements at some 
retail stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, and other health food stores.
Açaí juice is very expensive, especially 100 percent açaí juice. You can find 
less expensive juice blends that contain açaí. That’s fine as long as the other 
juices are also high in antioxidants, such as blueberry juice. Just be sure to 
read the label, and avoid juices with added sugar that you don’t need.
 
V-8 now has an açaí version of its V-8 Fusion juice — an easily found alterna-
tive to açaí berries or supplements.
Açaí berry supplements are made from freeze-dried berries (freeze-drying 
helps preserve their nutritional value) or extracts. Supplements vary in cost, 
but they have a longer shelf-life than the juice or pulp. You can keep the pulp 
in the refrigerator for a few days, or two to three months in the freezer.
Açaí juice or pulp can be added to fruit smoothies or blended with other 
juices. A traditional Rio Bowl is made by blending açaí pulp with a banana 
and apple juice, and serving it with granola on top.
Algae and Kelp from Lakes and the Sea
These two exotic superfoods come from the ocean and from freshwater lakes. 
Blue-green algae are one-celled organisms called cyanobacteria and aren’t 
really true algae. Kelp, which is commonly considered a seaweed, actually 
is an algae. But don’t let these technical details confuse you — both of our 
superfoods from the sea are very good for you.

150
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
There are two popular strains of blue-green algae: spirulina and aphanizom-
enon flos aquae (AFA). Kelp (technically known as Ascophyllum nodosum sea-
weed) is a marine plant.
We suggest you eat a little raw or dried kelp once a week and 3 to 5 grams 
of algae daily. Manufacturers may have different amounts of each in their 
products, so make sure you compare different brands and check their recom-
mended daily intake.
Taking advantage of kelp and algae
Algae and kelp both pack a powerful punch, nutritionally speaking. They’re 
among the lowest-calorie superfoods available and have been considered the 
most complete food sources you can find. They’re the best superfoods for 
trace minerals and have been a major part of Asian diets for decades.
With so many vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and other food chemi-
cals with antioxidant properties, these superfoods provide many different 
health benefits. They can reduce inflammation, aid in weight loss, boost your 
immune system, and help reduce the risk of heart disease and other chronic 
diseases.
Seeing what algae can do
Blue-green algae are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, B complex vita-
mins, vitamin C, beta carotene, and several minerals, including iron. Blue-
green algae also contain lots of complete protein (proteins that contain all of 
the essential amino acids). In fact, algae have one of the highest protein con-
tents per serving of all the superfoods. Algae are very rich in beta-carotene 
and chlorophyll, too, making them powerful antioxidants. One tablespoon of 
powdered blue-green algae contains 4 grams of protein and about 20 calories.
According to information published by the National Institutes of Health, blue-
green algae may help to reduce symptoms of nasal allergies, lower choles-
terol, and help to remove toxic arsenic from the body.
If you take a blue-green algae supplement, you may benefit from
 
✓ Anti-viral activity. Research at Harvard showed that an extract of spir-
ulina actually inhibited the replication of the HIV virus. There has also 
been speculation that this could have benefits for the common cold.
 
✓ Cancer prevention. One component of spirulina extract, called polysac-
charides, has been shown to repair damaged DNA in a laboratory setting. 
This could help fight cancers, which are a result of this type of damage.
 
✓ Treating anemia. A substance called phycocyanin found in blue-green 
algae may stimulate the body to make red blood cells, which in turn may 
help to treat some forms of anemia.

151
 Chapter 10: Exploring Exotic Superfoods
 
✓ Weight loss. The high protein content of algae helps control appetite 
because it keeps you feeling fuller longer. Powdered algae has been used 
in various diets and weight loss supplements.
 
✓ Treatment of degenerative nerve diseases. Researchers in Switzerland 
found that a compound derived from blue-green algae may counter the 
effects of Alzheimer’s disease and other degenerative nerve disorders by 
reducing inflammation.
Staying healthy with kelp
Kelp is rich in nutrients and can be an interesting way to add flavor and good 
health to your diet. Kelp is rich in potassium, iron, calcium, and omega-3 fatty 
acids. It’s also a good source of iodine, a mineral that’s important for optimal 
thyroid function. One-quarter cup constitutes one serving of raw kelp, and 
contains 8 calories.
 
If you’re pregnant or have a history or family history of thyroid disease, con-
sult your doctor before using kelp or iodine supplements. Some people are 
sensitive to iodine and may develop thyroid dysfunction. In any case, be sure 
to follow the label directions and consult with your doctor if you have any 
questions about the consumption of kelp.
When you eat kelp, you may improve your
 
✓ Thyroid function. Your thyroid gland acts like a thermostat that regu-
lates many bodily processes. Normal thyroid function requires iodine. 
If you don’t get enough iodine, you may suffer from an underactive thy-
roid, but if you get too much, you may overstimulate the thyroid. If your 
underactive thyroid isn’t related to iodine deficiency, taking iodine can 
make it worse. If you have a history of thyroid dysfunction, discuss the 
pros and cons of taking kelp with your doctor. If you have no history of 
thyroid disease, supplementing with kelp can have great benefits, but 
you should limit yourself to the quantity recommended on the product 
label.
 
✓ Weight control. Proper thyroid function helps control your weight.
 
✓ Cardiovascular health. Kelp is a good source of folate, which reduces 
your levels of the protein homeocysteine (high levels are associated with 
inflammation and damage to blood vessels).
 
✓ Odds of preventing breast cancer. This theory is still in the research 
stages, but kelp might have anti-estrogen effects that could help prevent 
and treat breast cancer.
 
✓ Odds of passing on birth defects. The folate in kelp helps to prevent a 
birth defect of the spine called spina bifida. Women who may become 
pregnant must get enough folate from their diet or in supplemental form 
as folic acid.

152
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Getting the superfoods of the sea
 
It’s important to purchase blue-green algae from sources that you can trust. 
The organisms in blue-green algae are harvested and then freeze-dried so they 
can be used in powders for supplementation, but the government doesn’t reg-
ulate the conditions for harvesting algae. Unscrupulous companies could pos-
sibly harvest toxic types of algae. Thus, make sure the company you purchase 
your supplements from harvests the algae, usually spirulina, from controlled, 
fresh-water ponds that are checked regularly for toxins.
Kelp can be purchased in Asian markets or retail stores that carry Asian food 
items. One variety of kelp is kombu, which is used in soups and stews or as a 
garnish.
You may also use nori, which is dried seaweed paper that can be found in 
many grocery stores. Nori is dark green and papery with a slight flavor of oily 
ocean fish. It’s used as a wrapper in a variety of sushi dishes.
Alginate is a carbohydrate extracted from kelp that’s used as a thickener for 
processed foods and snacks. You may see it on the list of ingredients when 
you buy ice cream, jams, jellies, soups, and other products.
Peruvian Camu-Camu
The camu-camu bush grows in the rainforests of Peru and Brazil and bears 
a fruit that resembles a large purplish grape with yellow flesh — one of the 
richest sources of vitamin C of any food (see Figure 10-2). That alone might 
make camu-camu a superfood, but the juice also contains anthocyanins 
(from the pigments), which means it’s an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory 
properties.
Why is there iodine in salt?
A disease called goiter used to be a little too 
common in the United States. A goiter is a swol-
len, underactive thyroid gland that makes the 
person who has it appear to have a large, thick 
neck. Goiters occur when a person’s diet is defi-
cient in iodine for a long time. The widespread 
iodine deficiency that caused so many goiters 
was almost wiped out when iodine was added 
to table salt. There are still some iodine defi-
ciencies in the United States, but the real prob-
lem lies in underdeveloped countries. Children 
who have iodine deficiency suffer from stunted 
growth and mental delay.

153

Camu-camu isn’t well-known as a superfood yet, but the health claims for 
camu-camu are impressive.
Providing copious amounts of vitamin C
A Brazilian study determined that camu-camu has so much vitamin C that 
pulp that has been stored for one month still contains more of the water-
soluble vitamin than most other well-known fresh sources. One-half teaspoon 
of dried camu-camu powder contains up to 380 milligrams of vitamin C. You 
would have to eat about five whole oranges or 4 cups of sliced strawberries 
to get that much vitamin C (and they’d have to be fresh).
Furthermore, the November 2005 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 
published research investigating the anthocyanin content of camu-camu. 
Anthocyanins are natural antioxidants, and further research will determine 
what additional health benefits may come from camu-camu.
The scientific world is just learning about camu-camu. However, anecdotal 
evidence supports the use of camu-camu for
 
✓ Fighting depression. The Clinician’s Handbook of Natural Healing lists 
camu-camu as one of the top plants for balancing mood and treating 
depression. Vitamin C is also important for the production of serotonin, 
a brain chemical that affects your mood.
 
✓ Improving attention. Camu-camu may improve attention by improv-
ing neurotransmitter function. More research is required to determine 
exactly how — and how much — camu-camu improves attention.

154
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
 
✓ Supporting your immune system. Vitamin C is crucial for a healthy 
immune system, and anthocyanins work as antihistamines and anti-
inflammatory agents. Camu-camu is loaded with both.
 
✓ Hurting the herpes virus. The Clinician’s Handbook of Natural Healing 
points to camu-camu as being effective in battling the herpes family 
of viruses, which cause cold sores and shingles (the same virus that 
causes chicken pox), among other ailments.
Finding and using camu-camu
Camu-camu powder is available online at Sunfood.com and other Web sites. 
You may also purchase health drinks that contain camu-camu juice along 
with other healthful fruit juices. Camu-camu is sold in some health food 
stores as a powder, but you may not be able to find much camu-camu in local 
retail stores just yet.
Coca-Cola sells a beverage called Camu-Camu and Vitamins that’s very popu-
lar in Japan, but it hasn’t made its way to the United States yet. Most camu-
camu is harvested in the wild and therefore is expensive. Full commercial 
production of camu-camu could take quite a few years, but when it does 
happen, the cost should drop considerably.
Although it’s expensive, a little powder goes a long way. One serving of camu-
camu is only ½ teaspoon, which you can mix with water or fruit juice. You 
can also stir your camu-camu into applesauce or add the powder to your 
favorite smoothie recipe. Drink powder and capsules can be stored at room 
temperature for several months.
Mexico’s Chia Seeds
Chia is a member of the mint family and is native to Mexico, where it has 
been used for thousands of years in cooking. The ancient Aztecs and Mayans 
ate chia seeds before entering into battle or making long treks to sustain their 
energy, give them endurance, and control their appetites when food would 
be difficult to find. Even a small amount of seeds (as little as 1/4 cup) was said 
to keep them satiated for a whole day. Chia seeds were once a major crop in 
Mexico; however, production was reduced after the Spanish Conquest.
Chia seeds are relatively unknown outside of Central America, but they’re 
increasingly gaining recognition as a superfood and, no doubt, demand will 
grow as the word spreads.

155
 Chapter 10: Exploring Exotic Superfoods
Cashing in on the health benefits of chia
Chia is making a name for itself in nutrition due to its neutral flavor and the 
fact that it contains large amounts of an omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-lino-
lenic acid (ALA), similar to the fats found in our superfood fish (see Chapter 7) 
and flax (see Chapter 6). In fact, chia seeds contain more omega-3 fats than 
flax seeds — and you don’t have to grind them up first. This fatty acid helps 
your heart and makes it easier to watch your weight.
Chia seeds are rich in calcium, manganese, and fiber, which are important for 
strong bones and good digestion. Chia contains two antioxidants, chlorogenic 
acid and caffeic acid, which are also found in coffee beans. Chia has a high 
percentage of protein, and it has all the essential amino acids (the building 
blocks of protein), so it’s a terrific source of protein for vegans.
There are two types of chia: black and white. Although the white seeds are 
harder to find and therefore more costly, there isn’t much difference nutri-
tionally. Both black and white chia seeds offer lots of nutrition in a small 
package. One serving of chia seeds is about 1 ounce and contains 10 grams of 
fiber and 139 calories.
When you eat chia seeds, you can feel good knowing that you are
 
✓ Preventing cardiovascular disease. A study in the 2007 Journal of 
Diabetes Care showed that regular chia consumption can lower blood 
pressure and reduce inflammation. The omega-3 fatty acids are great for 
lowering cholesterol, which also helps reduce your risk of cardiovascu-
lar disease.
 
✓ Keeping your gut in check. The fiber in chia is great for bowel regula-
tion and overall gastrointestinal health. You can also use chia to reduce 
the pain of heartburn.
 
✓ Watching your weight. Chia helps you feel full longer because it’s 
absorbed and metabolized slowly, which helps regulate insulin (a hor-
mone that controls blood sugar) so that you won’t feel a blood sugar 
drop that causes hunger. ALA may also make weight loss easier.
 
✓ Controlling blood sugar. Preventing and treating diabetes is all about 
blood sugar control and insulin regulation. Because chia is beneficial in 
both of these areas, it may aid in treatment of diabetes.
 
✓ Getting an energy boost. Chia seeds can absorb seven to ten times their 
weight in water, forming a gel that’s digested slowly, which helps to 
keep energy levels high.

156
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Incorporating chia in your diet
Chia seeds are easy to find online, and you may also find them in health food 
stores and other retail stores. Storing them is easy, too. Keep them at room 
temperature out of direct sunlight, and they’ll keep for up to two years — 
that’s one durable superfood.
There are several ways to get your daily dose of chia. Chia seeds have a neu-
tral flavor, so they can be added to almost any type of food. You can sprinkle 
chia seeds on a salad or stir them into a soup. You can also add them to reci-
pes for bread and muffins.
Alternatively, you can take 1 or 2 tablespoons of chia seeds or chia gel every 
day as a supplement. Make chia gel by adding 9 ounces of water to 1 ounce of 
chia seeds, and then mix until a gel forms. Let the gel stand at room tempera-
ture for 15 minutes, then store it in the refrigerator. Add the gel to fruit juice 
or a glass of water, or mix it into your morning bowl of oatmeal. The gel will 
keep in your refrigerator for up to two weeks.
 
If you have one of those grassy little Chia Pets — the clay pots, often in the shape 
of cartoon characters, that come with a seed-laden paste and sprout a green mini-
forest after a couple weeks — don’t eat your pet’s seeds, even though they’re 
the same. Make sure the chia seeds you buy are packaged as a food product. 
You can eat the sprouts from your Chia Pet, but we don’t recommend it because 
Chia Pet sprouts aren’t approved as a food product by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). Get your chia from a local health store. You can grow your 
own in a container garden, too; just make sure the seeds you use are labeled as a 
food product. See Chapter 14 for more information on container gardens.
Asia’s Goji Berries
Goji (pronounced go-gee) berries, which is the commercial name for wolfber-
ries, have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. 
True goji berries originate in Mongolia, but goji and wolfberries are very 
similar and hence are both considered goji berries. They’re rich in antioxi-
dants that help to protect the cells in your body. In fact, some experts believe 
they’re even more powerful than blueberries, which are at the top of the 
superfood chart for antioxidant properties.
The goji berry plant is a member of the nightshade family, which includes 
another superfood, the tomato, as well as peppers, eggplants, and potatoes. 
Goji berries are very delicate and cannot withstand shipment as fresh fruits, 
so they’re sold as juice or tea or in dried form (they resemble raisins, but 
with a lighter red color, see Figure 10-3). They have a slightly sour flavor, 
similar to cranberries or cherries (although some people think they taste 
more like plums).

157
 Chapter 10: Exploring Exotic Superfoods

The goji berry from Tibet has a sweeter flavor than the more bitter tasting 
wolfberries of China. Both are the same nutritionally. Most goji berries you’ll 
find in the stores and online are wolfberries, and they will most commonly be 
cheaper than true goji berries.
Goji berries fall into the recommended five-to-nine daily servings of fruits and 
vegetables, but they’re most often taken as a drink. We recommend 4 ounces 
of goji juice or one serving of berries daily.
Getting the goods on goji berries
Goji berries contain large amounts of phytochemical antioxidants like beta 
carotene and zeathanxin (which are related to vitamin A) and vitamin C. Goji 
berries are also rich in iron and fiber. Goji berry juice is packed with the 
same nutrients, but without the fiber. One ounce or 28 grams of goji berries 
has about 110 calories and 24 grams of carbohydrates.
Goji berries also contain the phytochemical betaine and a plant sterol called beta-
sitosterol. Plant sterols are similar to the cholesterol found in animals, but sterols 
actually lower your cholesterol when you eat them. According to the March 2007 
journal Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology, these compounds may also have pow-
erful anti-aging effects by protecting your nerve cells and the retinas of your eyes.

158
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
When you eat dried goji berries or drink goji berry juice, you may be
 
✓ Preventing age-related macular degeneration. The goji berry has high 
levels of the carotenoids beta-carotene and zeaxanthin, which are impor-
tant for normal vision. Zeaxanthin helps protects the retina and may 
reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
 
✓ Fighting cancer. The phytochemicals in goji berries may have power-
ful anti-cancer effects. One study published in the Chinese Journal of 
Oncology in 1994 found that goji berries had a positive effect on treat-
ments when used along with other medical cancer regimens.
 
✓ Helping with weight loss. Your body needs betaine to make choline and 
methionine (natural compounds found in your body). Both these com-
pounds are lipotropic; that is, they help to carry fat away from the liver 
and burn excess calories. Goji berries have an abundant amount of betaine.
 
✓ Protecting your heart. Beta-sitosterol helps lower cholesterol by block-
ing absorption of cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract. The goji berry 
has also been found to increase the amount of a powerful antioxidant 
called superoxide dismutase (SOD), which your cells make as a natural 
defender against free radical damage. Betaine can help reduce high 
levels of homocysteine, a protein associated with a higher risk of heart 
disease and inflammation.
 
✓ Boosting your libido. Goji is thought to help raise testosterone levels in 
both men and women, thereby increasing your sex drive. Beta-sitosterol 
may also help to prevent or reduce swelling of the prostate in men.
 
The goji berry has blood-thinning properties, so talk to your doctor before you 
add goji berries to your diet. This is especially important if you take any heart 
medications or blood thinners.
Antioxidant effects on cancer
One of the most exciting health benefits of 
superfoods is their positive effects on cancer 
prevention and treatment. Many of the super-
foods contain high levels of antioxidants, which 
are important for protecting cells from the 
damage created by free radicals. Free radicals 
are unstable molecules that travel through the 
body and can cause inflammation and cellular 
destruction. Antioxidants fight the free radicals 
and stabilize them to keep them from doing any 
more damage to the cells. Studies have sup-
ported that antioxidants can protect cells and 
reduce inflammation that can cause disease, 
including cancer. Large studies currently under-
way are looking specifically into the effects of 
antioxidants on cancer.

159
 Chapter 10: Exploring Exotic Superfoods
Getting your goji berries
You may not find these berries at your local grocery store, but you can 
find them online, at some health food stores, and at herbalists’ shops. (See 
Chapter 13 for tips on shopping for superfoods.) If you want to try goji juice, 
be prepared for some sticker-shock; it’s very expensive.
Dried goji berries make a delicious snack just as they are, or you can use 
them to make your own granola, similar to our superfood granola in Chapter 
16. Just add a few dried goji berries with the dried cranberries. You can also 
use goji berries in any recipe that calls for raisins. Add them to your morning 
oatmeal, or mix them into your next batch of muffins.
Dried goji berries keep for several months when stored at room temperature 
in a dry, dark place. If you soak the berries for eating, use them the same day you 
soak them; they spoil quickly after being exposed to water. Many goji juices will 
keep for 30 days when refrigerated, but check for brand differences after opening.
You can also get your goji as an extract or supplement, which is a convenient 
way to boost your daily antioxidant intake.
Thailand’s Mangosteen
Mangosteen, known as the “queen of fruits” because Queen Victoria suppos-
edly offered handsome rewards to those who brought her the fresh fruit, 
comes from a tree that grows in the southeast Asian countries of Indonesia, 
Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand. The tree grows to be about 50 
to 80 feet tall, and the fruit is about the size of a tangerine.
The white aril (the fleshy pulp) of the mangosteen is sweet and tangy and is very 
popular for its taste. The aril resembles a peeled citrus fruit with four to eight 
wedged segments. A thick maroon rind surrounds the white aril. See Figure 10-4.
The mango isn’t a mangosteen
Although the word “mango” is in the name, 
there’s no relationship between mangoes and 
the mangosteen fruit. Mangoes, which are also 
popular in southeast Asia, are red to yellowish 
fruits with a sweet golden flesh — and they’re 
quite healthful as well. While mangoes used to 
be considered rare and exotic fruits, they’re 
now commonly available in grocery stores.

When the mangosteen is ripe, both the rind and pulp are used for medicinal 
purposes. Mangosteens have been used in traditional Asian medicine to treat 
digestive disorders, infections, wounds, and ulcers. The thick maroon rind 
contains most of the antioxidants that make mangosteen so super.
Zeroing in on xanthones
This exotic superfood contains a high concentration of polyphenols (com-
pounds found in some plants that have health benefits) called xanthones. 
There are 40 different xanthones in the mangosteen that may exert some 
antioxidant effects. These powerful compounds go throughout your body, 
destroying free radicals that can cause inflammation and disease. The main 
xanthones are beta-, gamma-, and alpha-mangostin, and garcinone.
And that’s not all. According to a review in the October 2008 issue of the jour-
nal Food and Chemical Toxicology, the xanthones found in mangosteen also 
exhibit anti-cancer, anti-allergy, antibacterial, and antiviral properties — at 
least in the lab. Adding mangosteen to your superfoods diet may prove to be 
very beneficial to your health. One cup (196 grams) of mangosteen contains 
140 calories and about 35 grams of carbohydrates.
 
In order to reap the benefits of the xanthones, you need to find mangosteen 
juice or purée that includes the whole fruit. The white aril is delicious and 
does contain some vitamins and minerals, but the powerful polyphenols are in 
the maroon rind.

161
 Chapter 10: Exploring Exotic Superfoods
When you drink mangosteen juice or purée, you may improve your health by
 
✓ Keeping your digestive system healthy. The rind may be dried and 
ground into a powder to help with diarrheal illnesses and may be benefi-
cial for other gastrointestinal disorders as well.
 
✓ Fighting microbes. Several of the xanthones have antibacterial proper-
ties. Some of the extracts have been found to stop the growth of fungi 
and viruses as well. According to research performed in Thailand, man-
gosteen may also inhibit the organisms that cause tuberculosis.
 
✓ Lowering cholesterol. The xanthones keep the bad cholesterol (LDL, 
or low density lipoproteins) from sticking to your blood vessels, which 
reduces your risk for atherosclerosis (clogged arteries). Atherosclerosis 
can lead to cardiovascular disease.
 
✓ Fighting cancer? A Dutch study found that the rind was able to reduce 
cancer growth in rats, but no human studies have been performed. 
There is plenty of evidence to support further studies on the potential 
for treating cancer.
 
✓ Caring for your skin. Well . . . not by eating it, but by using mangosteen 
topically. The rind contains tannins (polyphenols that tighten mucous 
membranes and skin — also found in tea and red wine). When the rind 
is ground into a powder, the tannins can be used as an astringent for 
wound care. The extracts have also been used to treat eczema and other 
skin diseases. In some countries, mangosteen is mixed with a few other 
substances for use after circumcision.
 
✓ Alleviating allergies. The xanthones, especially gamma-mangostin, 
have been found to have antihistamine properties, which, along with the 
anti-inflammatory effects, make drinking mangosteen a good option for 
relieving some symptoms of airborne allergies.
 
 Some allergies are life-threatening. Don’t expect mangosteen to protect 
you from exposure to peanuts or other similar, dangerous allergies.
Getting your hands on mangosteen
Fresh mangosteen fruits are available at Asian markets. Look for mangosteens 
that are a rich purple or maroon with healthy green stems. Mangosteen also 
is sold as a juice, purée, or supplement online and in some health food stores 
and retail stores such as Costco. Pure mangosteen juice is expensive, so it’s 
usually mixed with other fruit juices. One of the first mangosteen drinks was 
a beverage called XanGo.

162
Part II: From Apples to Wheat Grass: A Look at the Superfoods 
Because the beneficial antioxidants come from the not-so-tasty rind, many 
people prefer to get their mangosteen in supplement form. If you choose 
supplements, be sure to follow the instructions on the label.
You can prepare fresh mangosteens by cutting through the rind around the 
middle of the fruit. Pry open the rind to find the beautiful white arils inside. 
If stored in a dry, dark area at room temperature, the fruit can keep for about 
three weeks; a ripe fruit can last a month in the refrigerator. Mangosteen 
juices typically stay fresh for several days, but refer to directions on indi-
vidual bottles.
North America’s Wheat Grass
Wheat grass is a homegrown superfood that has been quietly used as a 
superfood juice and supplement since the 1930s. Wheat grass is simply the 
green, grassy portion of wheat that’s harvested while the plants are young, 
within two weeks of sprouting. Wheat grass is an excellent source of vita-
mins, amino acids, and enzymes. There’s anecdotal evidence that wheat 
grass helps to detoxify your body, helps heal your digestive system, and 
gives you a boost of energy.
Harnessing the power of wheat grass
Wheat grass is rich in nutrients and chlorophyll, the substance that gives 
wheat grass its green color. Wheat grass is also rich in enzymes called gluta-
thione peroxidase and catalase, which may increase your levels of SOD — an 
enzyme in the body that acts as a natural antioxidant and targets a specific 
free radical that can damage cells. This is important because you can’t take 
SOD as a dietary supplement; you need to get the enzymes to make SOD from 
your diet.
 
A typical dose of wheat grass is 3.5 grams of powder or a 1-ounce shot of 
wheat-grass juice. Wheat grass contains vitamin A, B complex vitamins, vita-
min C, vitamin K, iron, and potassium. When you drink a shot of wheat-grass 
juice, you not only boost your energy, you boost your nutrient intake too. And 
all for only five calories per ounce.
Getting a 1-ounce serving of wheat-grass juice may improve your health by
 
✓ Healing your digestive tract. An article published in 2002 in the 
Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology found that wheat grass was 
beneficial for the treatment of individuals with ulcerative colitis — an 

163
 Chapter 10: Exploring Exotic Superfoods
inflammatory disease of the colon — as well as other diseases of the gas-
trointestinal tract.
 
✓ Caring for wounds. Chlorophyll has antibacterial properties that stimu-
late the healing of wounds.
 
✓ Making you more energetic. More than 60 years of research has been 
performed that compares chlorophyll and the oxygen carrier in the 
blood called hemoglobin. Drinking wheat-grass juice may improve the 
oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and help increase your red blood cell 
count.
 
✓ Preventing cancer. Because SOD is a powerful antioxidant that protects 
your cells from damage due to free radicals, it may help to reduce your 
risk of some forms of cancer.
Buying or growing wheat grass
Wheat grass has a natural fiber content that isn’t digestible in humans, so 
it has to be juiced to get the benefits of its phytochemicals and nutrients. 
Wheat grass can also be dried and used as a supplement.
You can buy wheat grass as a juice, powder, or in tablets or capsules that 
may be taken as dietary supplements. It’s available in many retail stores, 
health food stores, and online.
You can grow wheat grass at home with kits available in stores and online. 
Wheat grass makes a nice addition to any indoor superfoods garden. See 
Chapter 14 for more information on growing your own superfoods.
You can drink wheat-grass juice alone or mix it with fruit or vegetable juices 
and other healthful beverages. You can make your own superfood smoothie 
by blending one banana with some frozen blueberries and cranberries, plus a 
little applesauce and a shot of wheat grass.
 
You can also find “wheat-grass boosters” at juice bars and places that sell fruit 
smoothies, where supplemental wheat grass is added in order to boost your 
energy.

hoosing superfoods is beneficial no matter what the rest of your diet is 
like, but the results are magnified when those superfoods are incorpo-
rated into a diet that’s healthful overall.
Getting started isn’t all that difficult, and, once you get moving along, you’ll 
want to keep your superfoods diet going, even at restaurants and parties. In this 
chapter, we show you how to incorporate superfoods into your lifestyle — at 
home, at work, or at play.
Transforming Your Diet 
into a Superfoods Diet
A superfoods diet isn’t like a fad diet or crash diet that requires you to give 
up or severely restrict any nutrients. A healthy diet includes foods of all 
kinds, because when you eliminate certain food groups or nutrients (such as 
bread and cereals, carbohydrates, or fats), you feel deprived, and then you 
go off whatever diet you were on. By choosing a superfoods diet, you reduce 
the amounts of not-so-healthy foods you eat, and focus on adding lots of 
healthy (and delicious) foods from all the food groups.
The changes you make in your diet will last your whole life. You do need to 
sacrifice a little bit, like cutting way back on eating greasy processed foods 
and sugary snacks, but the payback is enjoying a healthy, youthful body. And 
when your superfoods diet has you feeling healthy and energetic, you won’t 
really miss the junk foods at all.

168
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Making the shift: Identifying the foods 
you should eat more or less of
Start with a basic healthy diet. Eat less of the foods that are bad for you and 
more of the foods that are good for you. First, restrict these foods:
 
✓ Extra added sugar, including sucrose and high fructose corn syrup: 
Replace regular soda with caffeine-free diet soda or water. Cut back 
on candy, pastries, and other sweets. Sweeteners add calories fast but 
don’t add any nutrition, so don’t consume more than 3 tablespoons of 
sugar, high fructose corn syrup, or honey per day (one can of soda has 
about 31/2 tablespoons of sweetener). Replace empty sugar calories with 
superfood fruits that are naturally sweet, and you won’t miss the sugar.
 
✓ Saturated and trans fats: Cut back on fatty red meats, switch to nonfat 
milk, and avoid processed foods and stick margarines that have “par-
tially hydrogenated oil” as an ingredient. Choose seafood, skinless 
chicken, turkey, lean beef, and pork, but avoid anything that’s deep-
fried. Substitute superfood fish and legumes for red meats in order to 
get the protein you need without the unhealthy saturated fats. Replace 
trans-fat-laden stick margarine with olive oil or with margarines made 
with olive oil, flax oil, or canola oil (without partial dehydrogenation).
 
✓ Extra sodium: It’s okay to sprinkle some salt on your foods (some 
experts think unprocessed sea salt is best), but watch out for extra salt 
and sodium hidden in highly processed and canned foods and most 
boxed meal mixes. Superfoods in their natural forms are low in sodium. 
Look for low-sodium versions of canned foods (even superfoods), or opt 
for fresh or frozen whenever possible.
Replace the restricted items in the preceding list with healthier alternatives 
by eating more of these:
 
✓ Healthy fats: Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish, flax, 
chia, pumpkin seeds, and canola oil. Choose olive oil, avocado, and nuts 
for healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.
 
✓ Fiber: Increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Most 
days you should choose more vegetables than fruits. And consume 
whole-grain breads, cereals, and pasta to add much-needed fiber.
 
✓ Healthy proteins: The best protein sources include all meats, seafood, 
eggs, dairy products, nuts, and legumes. What makes a protein source 
healthful is not so much the type of protein, but how that source is pre-
pared. For example, grilled shrimp is good, but shrimp scampi is high 
in saturated fat and bad for your heart and arteries. A skinless chicken 
breast is good, but deep-fried chicken is not so good because the batter 
adds extra fat and calories.

169
 Chapter 11: Bringing Superfoods into Your Life
 
Calories matter. If you want to lose weight, you have to cut calories from your 
diet or exercise more — preferably both. If you want to gain weight, you need 
to add a few calories (from healthful foods) every day. Use a food diary to track 
your calorie consumption (see the sidebar “Keeping a food diary” for help).
Fitting in superfoods every day
We suggest that you eat at least two superfoods each day as you start your 
superfoods diet. Eat one at breakfast or as a snack, and eat another at lunch 
or dinner. When this becomes a habit, add a third superfood, and eventually 
a fourth. As you get used to choosing nutritious foods for every meal, many 
of your choices will automatically be superfoods.
Looking at your dietary needs for a typical day, you can see how easily super-
foods can fit in. The United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA) has 
designed a food pyramid to help you figure out how many foods you need to 
eat from each food group every day. Here’s what the food pyramid calls for:
 
✓ Six to eleven servings from the bread and cereal group: At least half of these 
servings should be whole grains. Our superfoods grains — oats and quinoa — 
fit in nicely here. Other good choices include 100 percent whole wheat, spelt 
(which is similar to wheat), popcorn, cornmeal, brown rice, and barley.
 
✓ Five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables: All fruits and vegetables 
are good for you and can fulfill your daily need for this food group. It’s 
Keeping a food diary
People who keep track of the foods they eat in 
food diaries lose more weight than people who 
don’t used food diaries, and the note-takers are 
more likely to keep off the weight. A food diary 
can be as simple as a little notebook you carry 
with you so you can write down all the foods 
you eat and the beverages you drink every day. 
Make a note of the portion sizes, too. Keeping a 
diary shows you whether you’re getting enough 
fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and other 
healthful foods. You also know whether you’re 
eating too many unhealthy foods.
You can get a little fancier with your food diary by 
keeping track of calories. (You can find calorie 
counts online at Web sites like calorie
count.about.com or www.nutrition
data.com, or pick up a calorie book at your 
local bookstore.) You also can keep track of the 
number of grams of fat, sugars, and sodium you 
consume. Go high-tech and use the pyramid 
tracker at mypyramid.gov, or join a group 
on a dieting Web site that allows you to enter 
the foods you eat and get the math done for 
you, instantly. Some sites even let you enter 
your foods from your cellphone, which is very 
convenient when you’re on the run.

170
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
best to choose a few more vegetables than fruits. For example, three 
servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit is fine for a smaller 
woman; a large man can eat five servings of vegetables and four servings 
of fruit. Our superfood fruits and vegetables are even better, because 
they’re rich in extra nutrients and fiber.
 
✓ Three servings of dairy or calcium-fortified foods: Yogurt is really quite 
good for you because it contains probiotics (friendly bacteria that keep 
your gut healthy). Yogurt works with superfoods, too, because it goes 
very well with added fruit and nuts. Orange juice fortified with calcium is 
readily available, so it fits into this food group, too.
 
✓ Two to three servings of meat and dry beans: The best meats for this 
category are low-fat meats, so lean beef, pork, eggs, skinless chicken, 
turkey, fish, and seafood are good choices. Superfoods for this group 
include salmon, tuna, sardines, trout, and legumes.
 
✓ Fats and oils: You get the fats that you need from the foods you eat, 
including fish, meats, nuts, seeds, dressings, and any cooking oil you 
use. Here, fish does double duty as a superfood protein source and a 
healthful fat. Other good fats come from a variety of superfoods, includ-
ing flax, pumpkin seeds, olive oil, avocado, and chia.
 
✓ Discretionary calories: This is where your treats — sodas, cookies, 
cakes, and candy — fit in, and the allotment is only about 100 to 200 
calories per day. It’s not much (we hate to break it to you, but a typi-
cal candy bar is 200 to 300 calories), but a little bit of these treats can 
keep cravings at bay so you don’t feel deprived. Choose your superfood 
treats wisely. For example, enjoy 1 ounce of dark chocolate or one 
5-ounce glass of wine, but don’t overdo it.
 
Pump up the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat every day, because this 
is the easiest way to add more superfoods — almost automatically — given 
that many typical fruits and vegetables are superfoods.
Portion control: Determining what 
constitutes a serving
Understanding serving sizes is crucial for controlling portion sizes and get-
ting enough (or avoiding getting too much) of certain foods. Portion distortion, 
or eating huge helpings of food, is one of the reasons people gain too much 
weight. Portion control is important for energy-dense foods (foods high in 
calories) such as nuts, seeds, and starchy foods like potatoes and pasta. It’s 
even more important for snacks and junk food; one portion of tortilla chips is 
about 14 chips, not a whole big bag.

171
 Chapter 11: Bringing Superfoods into Your Life
 
Servings are measured in ounces, cups, teaspoons, and tablespoons. We rec-
ommend that you purchase an inexpensive kitchen scale and some measur-
ing cups and spoons to measure your daily servings. Also be sure to read the 
Nutrition Facts labels on packaged foods, which are sometimes a little mis-
leading. For example, a can of condensed soup mixed with water is probably 
three servings, not just one. Even many “single-serving” microwavable soups 
actually contain two servings.
 
A serving and a portion are not necessarily the same. A serving is a measured 
amount, such as an 8-ounce glass of milk or 1/2 cup of sliced fruit. A portion 
is the amount of food that you choose to eat or that someone serves you. So 
while that giant bagel you buy at the coffee shop is only one portion, it may 
really be equal to four or five servings from the bread and cereal group. The 
following list identifies what constitutes a serving of some common foods:
 
✓ Fruits: One serving of fruit is equal to 1/2 cup of sliced fruit, or half of a 
large whole fruit. Half a cup is about the size of a baseball. One serving 
of dried fruit is smaller because it has been dehydrated. A serving of 
dried fruit is about the size of a golf ball.
 
✓ Vegetables: One serving of vegetables is also 1/2 cup, the size of a base-
ball. Because green leafy vegetables are so low in calories, one serving is 
about 1 to 2 cups.
 
✓ Breads and cereals: One slice of bread counts as a serving in the cereal 
group. A serving of rice or pasta equals 1/2 cup — again, about the size of 
a baseball (think of that plate of spaghetti — that’s likely to be multiple 
servings).
 
✓ Fats and oils: One serving of oil or fat is 1 teaspoon, which is about the 
size of the tip of your thumb. Many of your fats are found in your pro-
tein sources, like nuts. One serving of nuts is 1 ounce. That’s equal to 25 
almonds or 9 walnuts.
 
✓ Proteins: One serving of protein is equal to 3 ounces of meat, fish, or 
poultry, which is about the size of a deck of cards (that big rib-eye at the 
steakhouse is about three servings). A serving of a thinner fillet of fish is 
about the size of a checkbook. One egg is equal to one protein serving, 
and one serving of legumes is 1/2 cup, about the size of a baseball.
When you’re eating packaged foods, you can figure out how much of it con-
stitutes one serving by taking a look at the Nutrition Facts label on the pack-
age. The USDA requires nutrition facts labeling on all packaged foods, based 
on servings per package. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows 
common measurements to be used on the labels, such as cup, tablespoon, or 
teaspoon; or less specific measurements such as piece, slice, or fraction; or 
even to designate the containers themselves, such as a jar or bottle. Ounces 
may be used as a serving size, but only if a common household unit is not 

172
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
applicable and an appropriate visual unit is given, such as “1 oz chips = about 
15 chips.” See Chapter 13 for more in-depth info on deciphering package labels.
 
Think about these different serving sizes and how they vary from the portions 
you receive in restaurants (or maybe serve at home). When you’re faced with a 
big plate of food at a restaurant, ask to have part of it wrapped up to go home 
with you. At home, you can control portion sizes by dishing up individual plates, 
rather than serving family style (with lots of bowls of food on the table), which 
leads to a lot of second and third helpings. Remember that calories count, and 
even too much of a superfood can lead to weight gain from extra calories.
Getting the right number 
of superfood servings
Getting the right number of servings is important for getting enough nutrition 
without getting too many (or too few) calories. Most of our superfoods are 
low in calories (fish, fruits, and vegetables), so that actually allows for more 
servings rather than fewer. However, you still need to be careful with some of 
our superfoods, such as the nuts and oils that can rack up the calories fast if 
you eat too much.
Volumes of veggies
Let’s start with the foods you can eat a lot of — those delicious vegetables. 
All our superfood vegetables are low in calories because they’re high in fiber 
(see Chapter 5). For example, one medium tomato has only about 25 calories, 
but it’s packed with nutrients such as vitamin C and lutein (a powerful anti-
oxidant). Green and other colorful vegetables are also low in calories, while 
being high in fiber and nutrients.
Eat several servings of vegetables every day. The USDA food pyramid sug-
gests 2 cups at a minimum (at least three servings), but, for good health, you 
can eat much more than that — 4 cups each day of low-calorie vegetables are 
good for you and are a great way to eat your superfood vegetables.
Scores of fruits
You can also eat many servings of fruit as long as they’re whole fruits or used 
as ingredients in healthy recipes. An apple is good for you; a piece of apple 
pie isn’t, because pie has a lot of added sugar, fat, and calories. On the other 
hand, our Baked Apples (see Chapter 19) are a good option for getting more 
fruit in your diet with just a little extra sugar.
Fruit generally has a few more calories than vegetables, so you may want 
to keep that in mind if you’re watching calories closely. An orange or an 
apple has about 80 calories. That’s more than a tomato, but way less than a 
candy bar.

173
 Chapter 11: Bringing Superfoods into Your Life
The USDA food pyramid includes about 11/2 to 2 cups of fruit in a balanced 
diet (three to four of your daily five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables). 
That’s about the same as eating one apple and half a banana. But because 
fruits are so good for you, feel free to eat 21/2 to 3 cups every day.
Being smart with fish
Our superfood fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids (see Chapter 7), and we agree 
with the American Heart Association recommendation that you should eat fish 
at least twice per week. Our superfood fish are all low in mercury, but there are 
valid concerns about mercury toxicity in fish, so it may be smart to limit your 
weekly intake to about 12 ounces, or three to four servings, each week.
Picking fats prudently
Nuts such as almonds and walnuts are so delicious that it’s easy to get car-
ried away when you eat them. Although the fats they contain are healthful 
fats, they also contain calories that need to be counted if you’re watching 
your weight. If you want to lose weight, limit your servings of nuts and seeds 
to just one per day (about 25 almonds or 9 walnuts) and use them as one of 
your daily servings in the meat and beans category.
If you need to gain weight, eating extra servings of nuts is a good way to get 
extra nutritious calories — much better than choosing empty-calorie junk foods.
Olive oil is another one of our superfoods because the fats it contains are 
good for your heart (see Chapter 9). But olive oil is also high in calories. It’s 
important to balance the healthful properties of good fats with the extra calo-
ries that can lead to weight gain, so measure olive oil carefully when you use it. 
Don’t drench your salad with olive oil, for example; just give it a light drizzle.
Being cautious with two superfoods
Dark chocolate and red wine both contain beneficial phenols (see Chapter 9), 
but they need to be enjoyed in moderation. Cocoa is the magic ingredient in 
dark chocolate that makes it so good for you, but chocolate is usually eaten 
as that delicious confection called the candy bar, with added sugar and fats.
 
You don’t need much dark chocolate — only about 1 ounce each day, or one 
small square of a dark chocolate candy bar. If you eat more than that, the calo-
ries and the sugar add up fast.
Red wine is another superfood that needs to be consumed wisely (see 
Chapter 9). We recommend no more than 5 ounces of red wine on any day. 
And if you don’t drink alcohol, we don’t want you to start. There are other 
ways to get those healthy phytochemicals.
 
Alcohol should not be consumed by women who are pregnant or nursing, 
people with a history or high risk of alcoholism, or people who are not of legal 
age to consume alcohol.

174
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
 
A little bit of alcohol may be beneficial, but more is definitely not better. Should 
you choose to enjoy red wine as a superfood, please do so responsibly.
Taking inventory
Look through your refrigerator, freezer, and cabinets and take an inventory 
of what’s there. Dry beans, vegetables, fruits, seafood, and whole grains are 
good; you want to keep those. But do you also find lots of potato chips, pas-
tries, ramen noodles, tortilla chips, candies, and ice cream? Those aren’t so 
good. If you don’t have the heart to throw them out, that’s okay; just don’t 
replace them with the same foods when they’re gone. When that potato chip 
bag goes in the garbage, use the empty space to house a bunch of bananas or 
a few cans of tuna instead.
To remind yourself to buy foods that are good for you (and avoid the bad 
ones), make a shopping list. (You can find out lots more about shopping for 
superfoods in Chapter 13.) Using a shopping list keeps you on track with 
your superfoods diet and out of the junk food aisles.
Adding Superfoods to Your Meals
Another important step in getting started with a superfoods diet is getting 
those superfoods into your meals. Some of your favorite recipes may already 
have superfoods as ingredients (those are good to keep) and you can browse 
through our recipes in Chapters 16–19 to get more ideas.
So what do you do with the recipes that don’t have any superfoods in them? 
Many recipes can be made healthier by substituting superfoods for ingre-
dients that aren’t so healthy. For example, many baked goods taste just as 
good when you replace some of the fat with applesauce. Or you can replace 
some flour with dry oatmeal (see our Salmon Cakes in Chapter 19). Another 
easy substitution is olive oil for regular vegetable oils.
If some of your favorite recipes just don’t allow for substitutions, how about 
some additions? A plain muffin gets healthier when blueberries or dried cran-
berries and chopped pecans are added. Or sprinkle some chopped almonds on 
your favorite vegetable dishes. Top your oatmeal, vegetable side dishes, and 
salads with ground chia or flax seeds to add extra nutrition and nutty flavor.
Make superfoods a part of every meal: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In the 
next three sections, we show you how.

Starting your day with superfoods
Breakfast is a good time to get some superfoods into your stomach, which 
is a great way to start your day. Breakfast eaters tend to be more success-
ful at watching their weight, and kids who eat breakfast do better in school. 
But remember, not any old breakfast foods will do. Typical breakfast foods 
usually include lots of sugar and fat. Pastries, sugary cereals, pancakes with 
syrup, sausages, and greasy eggs all taste good, but revising your menu to 
incorporate superfoods makes your breakfast much healthier.
If you’re used to eating sweet stuff in the morning, reduce the sugar and get your 
sweetness fix from superfood fruits. Instead of sugar-frosted breakfast flakes, eat 
a bowl of whole-grain cereal topped with lots of berries or banana slices. (If you 
choose oatmeal to go with those berries, you already have two superfoods.)
You can make your omelets into superfood omelets when you cut back on 
the cheese and meats and add lots of vegetables like tomatoes, spinach, or 
broccoli. Check out Chapter 16 for our superfood breakfast recipes.
Need your morning caffeine fix? Switch out your coffee for green tea, which 
has antioxidants that may prevent cancer (see Chapter 9) and still has a little 
caffeine to perk you up.
If you regularly sleep in and skip breakfast, use the superfoods to get you 
into the healthy habit of eating something before work or school. You don’t 
need to start eating a massive breakfast; just grab a banana and a handful of 
pecans, and you’re ready to head out the door.
Packing healthier lunches
Lunch may mean eating at restaurants, cafeterias, or packing your lunch. We 
talk about restaurants later in this chapter; here we focus on lunches that 
you pack yourself.
Expanding the definition of breakfast
There isn’t any reason why you need to eat 
“breakfast” foods in the morning — you can 
eat fish, chicken, or even whole-grain pasta if 
you prefer. A breakfast with plenty of protein 
(and much less sugar) keeps you feeling full 
and energetic all morning. So if you want to eat 
dinner foods at breakfast time, go ahead.

Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
 
Save money and get good nutrition by taking your lunch to work or school at 
least three days each week.
Sandwiches can be made with whole-grain bread (including oatmeal or nuts 
as ingredients), and you can add an extra slice of tomato or use spinach leaves 
in place of lettuce. Toss out the chips and pack crunchy vegetables instead.
When you want a change of pace from sandwiches, you can pack vegetable 
soup (use an insulated soup container if you don’t have a refrigerator and 
microwave handy). If you have a refrigerator and microwave at work, then you 
can bring leftover salmon from dinner the night before. You can also pack a 
salad in a plastic container. Choose any of our superfood vegetables and fruits, 
plus some nuts (and maybe a little bit of cheese). Pour your salad dressing into 
a separate container or zip-top bag so your salad isn’t soggy by lunchtime.
Round out your superfoods lunch with a healthy beverage. Dump the sugary 
soda and have 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice instead. Many varieties are 
available in single-serving bottles.
Keep healthy snacks at work so you won’t find yourself raiding the vending 
machines. Dried fruits and nuts keep well and are very portable so you can 
take them wherever you go.
 
Remember that superfoods are good for kids, too, so send healthy lunches 
to school. Or, if your children eat in the cafeteria, urge them to choose some 
fruits and vegetables at lunchtime. Of course, we know kids don’t always 
make the best choices on their own, so make sure they get their superfoods at 
breakfast and dinner.
Serving super dinner dishes
There are several ways to get superfoods into your dinners. Consider these 
options:
 
✓ Start your dinner with a healthy garden salad made with superfood veg-
etables on spinach leaves and topped with a few chopped nuts. You can 
even serve a big salad as a meal in itself.
 
✓ Serve a soup before dinner, like a vegetable stew.
 
✓ Choose superfoods as side dishes. A superfoods side dish can be as simple 
as steamed broccoli with a little lemon, or a bit fancier, like Creamy Feta 
Spinach (see Chapter 18). Make your side dishes colorful — it’s the color 
in vegetables that adds so much of the extra antioxidant protection.

177
 Chapter 11: Bringing Superfoods into Your Life
 
✓ Use superfood fish (see Chapter 7) for a variety of main dishes. Salmon 
is particularly good because of its high omega-3 fatty acid content. Tuna 
is good, and so is trout, so you can eat lots of fish and still have a variety 
of flavors.
 
✓ Bring superfoods to dinner with dessert. Our Baked Apples (see Chapter 
19) are deliciously sweet with only a little added sugar. You can also 
serve berries and cream for a delicious and super-nutritious dessert.
 
When you plan dinner, divide your plate into four equal sections. One quarter 
is for your serving of protein, usually meat, poultry, or fish. Another section 
is for something starchy like potatoes or rice. The other half of the plate is for 
green and colorful vegetables, such as beets, carrots, and broccoli.
Facing objections from other family members? Many people have a natural 
resistance to change, even when it’s for the better. See Chapter 12 for ideas 
on how to get everyone onboard.
Eating Out with Superfoods
Americans spend about half of their food dollars in restaurants. People eat 
out for convenience, because they travel a lot, and sometimes just for fun. 
While it’s easy to go to a restaurant (or bring home take-out), it’s important 
to remember two things: Many menu selections are high in calories, and 
they’re served in huge portions.
Frequently dining out probably isn’t the best way to maintain a healthy diet. 
But if you do eat many of your meals out, you can make better menu choices 
and even find a few superfoods in restaurants.
Finding fast-food superfood
Fast-food restaurants are everywhere, with a variety of specialties — ham-
burger places, hot dog stands, chicken places, ice cream stands, and sand-
wich shops, just to name a few. Usually, fast-food joints serve the meals with 
the most calories and the poorest nutrition.
So why do people eat them? Because they’re cheap, convenient, and tasty. 
Our best advice is to avoid fast-food places when you can. When you need 
to eat fast food, choose small portions and look for superfoods. Finding 
superfoods at fast-food places is a little easier today than it was a couple of 
decades ago.

178
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
The best fast-food restaurants are the sub sandwich shops. There, you 
can choose lean meats, including tuna, and add tomatoes along with other 
vegetables. Opt for just a little dressing — sub shops usually don’t use 
healthy oils.
 
Here are some tips for finding superfoods at fast-food restaurants:
 
✓ Choose a side salad or fruit, like apple slices, instead of greasy fries.
 
✓ Order apple or orange juice instead of soda.
 
✓ Eat a meal-sized salad for lunch.
 
Not all salads sold at fast-food restaurants are healthy. Taco salads are usually 
very high in calories and fat, as are salads topped with fried chicken strips. 
Look for salads with grilled, low-fat meats, or just fruits and vegetables.
Ordering superfoods at 
sit-down restaurants
Sit-down restaurants usually have more menu choices than fast-food restau-
rants. This is good because more healthy foods are available, but it’s also 
bad because lots of unhealthy (but delicious) choices are offered too. The 
key to eating a superfoods diet in a sit-down restaurant is to choose wisely 
and not be tempted by the unhealthy foods.
 
Here are some tips for finding superfoods at sit-down restaurants:
 
✓ Look for superfoods in the salads. Many restaurants offer a variety of 
interesting and healthful salads. If the restaurant has a salad bar, be sure 
to take advantage of it by loading up on superfoods.
 
✓ Ask what the vegetable of the day is when one is offered.
 
✓ Check out the soup of the day. Vegetable soups are healthy and filling.
 
✓ Order fish that has been baked or broiled. Look for our superfood fish 
such as salmon, tuna, and trout, which are often sold at restaurants.
 
✓ Look for vegetarian meals, which often include some superfoods.
 
✓ Ask for fruit for dessert.
 
Many sit-down restaurants serve their meals in such large portions that it’s 
easy to eat too much. When you eat out, ask to have half of your main meal 
wrapped to take home, or share your meal with a dining partner.

179
 Chapter 11: Bringing Superfoods into Your Life
Seeking out superfoods at parties
Parties are a lot of fun and they usually include food and drink — sometimes 
a lot of food and drink — especially during the holiday season. Many people 
gain a pound or two each year between Thanksgiving and Christmas and 
never lose that extra weight. After a few years, that adds up.
 
Your superfoods diet will get you through parties. To ensure your success at 
staying the course, keep the following tips in mind:
 
✓ Avoid high-calorie sweets.
 
✓ Eat a small, high-fiber, superfood snack before you go, such as an apple, 
an orange, or a handful of nuts. Don’t go to the party starving; you’ll 
overeat and choose the wrong stuff.
 
✓ Don’t stand by the buffet. Enjoy conversation with friends away from the 
food and the temptation.
 
✓ Look for foods that have lots of colorful fruits and vegetables, especially 
the fresh vegetables and dip.
 
✓ At a sit-down dinner party, don’t take seconds of the turkey and gravy; 
have some extra broccoli or carrots if you’re still hungry.
 
✓ Bring a superfoods side dish or appetizer (see Chapters 18 and 19) and 
show your friends and family that eating healthy foods doesn’t mean 
you have to forfeit taste.

Chapter 12
Getting Your Family Onboard
In This Chapter
▶ Getting the family together
▶ Fitting superfoods into a busy lifestyle
▶ Making superfoods fun for kids
▶ Serving superfoods to family members away from home
S
uperfoods are good for family members of all ages, from kids to grand-
parents. The growing bodies and minds of children need superfoods to 
feel good and do well in school. As parents and grandparents grow older, 
they don’t need as much food, but the food they eat has to provide the right 
nutrients to age gracefully and stay healthy.
Getting your family to actually eat superfoods, though, can be challenging. 
Some members of your family may be excited about eating healthful foods, 
but others may not be quite ready for radical dietary changes. That’s 
okay; there are ways to include everyone in a superfoods diet, even if just 
a little bit.
Fortunately, there are lots of superfoods, and they offer a bountiful variety 
of flavors and textures. That makes it easier to find superfoods that please 
everybody, even the pickiest kids and the grumpiest grandparents. Maybe 
getting your whole family onboard seems daunting, but don’t worry. With a 
few tips, you’ll have everyone eating better. In this chapter, we explain how 
to get superfoods into the diets of your family members.
Gathering for Family Meals
Many families have very demanding schedules with everyone heading in 
a different direction, so it may be difficult to monitor what foods everyone is 
eating all the time. Your family members may skip some meals or choose 
sugary snacks and sodas during the day. And that makes eating together 
even more important. When you share a family meal, you get the opportunity 
to provide healthful superfoods to everyone — at least for that meal.

182
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Dinner may be the easiest meal for everyone to attend, or maybe breakfast 
time works better for your family. Either is fine, because it isn’t the time of 
day that matters — it’s the time together.
 
Ideally, you should have at least one meal together every day. In the real 
world, though, that isn’t always possible. Don’t worry if you can only get 
everybody together two or three times a week. Instead, focus on fitting in as 
many superfood-friendly family meals during your week as you can.
Understanding the importance 
of eating together
Families who eat meals together get more than nutritious meals with lots of 
superfoods — they also fare better emotionally. For many busy families, 
meals provide the only regular opportunity to catch up on each other’s lives. 
Also, teenagers are less likely to suffer from eating disorders when the family 
shares meals. Family mealtime is a great time to reinforce table manners, 
how to share, and how to enjoy conversation with other people.
 
According to research done at the National Center on Addiction and 
Substance Abuse, kids who eat meals together with their family regularly have 
a lower risk of drug abuse, are less likely to smoke, and are less likely to be 
depressed.
Eating with friends and family is important for adults, too (especially for 
older adults). People tend to eat less when they’re alone, which is one reason 
why malnutrition is more common in elderly people who live alone.
Adding superfoods to family meals
 
When you cook the family dinner, you get to decide what is served. What a 
great time to get some superfoods into everyone’s diet! Here are some 
suggestions for adding superfoods to your family’s menu:
 
✓ Start meals with a hearty soup, such as tomato bisque or bean soup.
 
✓ Serve a salad before a meal (or make it big and serve it as a meal). 
Salads are a great way to get lots of superfood fruits, vegetables, and 
nuts into a meal.
 
✓ Serve more fish and less red meat. Heart-healthy salmon, tuna, and trout 
are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and low in saturated fat.
 
✓ Add super side dishes such as kale, broccoli, carrots, or beets.
 
✓ Ditch the sugary desserts and enjoy fresh fruits and berries instead.

183
 Chapter 12: Getting Your Family Onboard
For more specific ideas, turn to Chapters 16–19 where we provide lots of 
delicious superfood recipes that are easy to incorporate into your menus 
and your lifestyle.
Planning Ahead for Your Family
It would be nice to be able to eat every meal together as a family, but that 
isn’t possible. You may have different school and work schedules, and 
sports, clubs, and other activities may keep you busy at night. However, 
while you can’t have everyone together for every meal, you can do your best 
to provide superfoods for everyone in your family.
Stocking your kitchen
 
You can help keep your family healthy by having good foods ready to go 
at any time, no matter how crazy your family’s schedules are. That way, 
everyone gets good nutrition. Keep these foods ready for your family:
 
✓ Oatmeal and oat cereals: Your family can start the day with a healthful 
superfoods breakfast, even if you’ve already left for work. Hot oatmeal is 
easy to make, or you can buy cold cereals made with oats.
 
✓ Fresh fruits: Instead of a cookie jar, keep a fruit bowl on the counter for 
easy-to-grab, healthful snacks. Bananas, oranges, and apples keep very 
well at room temperature and are much healthier than greasy chips or 
sugary candy bars.
 
✓ Superfoods lunches: Pack superfoods lunches for family members to 
grab on their way out the door to work or school. Add tomatoes and 
avocado to sandwiches, and pack carrot sticks on the side. Include 
apple or orange juice as a superfoods beverage. Chapter 11 provides 
more healthy lunch ideas.
 
✓ After-school snacks: A lot of kids come home from school a few hours 
before dinnertime, and they’re usually hungry. Keep a few superfoods 
around for your children. Canned tuna and almond butter are great for 
sandwiches (though not together!). Nuts and seeds are great for snacks. 
Guacamole and salsa make delicious dips.
 
✓ Superfood beverages: Cut out the sugary soft drinks and keep apple, 
pomegranate, and orange juice on hand. You can get some great new 
juice options that contain real fruit and vegetables, such as V8 Splash 
and V-Fusion (visit www.v8juice.com/products.aspx for more 
info). Each 8-ounce glass of V-Fusion equals one serving of fruit and one 
serving of vegetables! Also, kids (and adults) can make their own sodas 
by mixing fruit juice with club soda or sparkling water.

Preparing for traveling
Sometimes the family is together but too busy to focus on eating healthful 
foods, like when you’re traveling or on vacation. Taking a vacation doesn’t 
mean you have to give up your healthful superfoods diet. Whether you travel 
by car, bus, train, or plane, the trip will go better if everyone is well-fed.
 
Avoid the usual pitfalls of junk foods and fast foods that accompany most 
family vacations. Here are our tips for finding superfoods when you’re away 
from home:
 
✓ In the car: Pack a cooler with crisp fresh vegetables and an assortment 
of veggie dips. Bring along some fruit juices in single-serving boxes and 
bottles.
 
✓ At service stations: When you stop to fill up your gas tank, the family 
may want to fill up on junk food. Help your family choose healthier 
alternatives, such as fresh fruits, granola mixes, nuts and seeds, and 
healthful beverages.
 
✓ At airports and train stations: Take a small bag of granola, nuts, seeds, 
and dried fruits such as cranberries, apples, and bananas so you aren’t 
as tempted to stop for fast foods at the airport or train station.
 
✓ At restaurants: Choose vegetable-filled omelets for breakfast and start 
dinners with a fresh salad. Ask for cooked green or mixed vegetables as 
your side dish.
 
✓ At hotels: Bring along superfood snacks to eat at the hotel, or find the 
nearest grocery store where you can buy fresh superfood fruits and 
vegetables to keep in a cooler (or in a small refrigerator, if your hotel 
room has one).
Making Superfoods Kid-Friendly
Kids benefit from eating superfoods, especially the foods rich in omega-3 
fatty acids such as fish, flax, chia seeds, walnuts, and soy. An article in 
the January 2008 issue of Current Opinion in Psychiatry states that omega-3 
fatty acids may be valuable for treating depression in children. Research 
published in the June 2005 issue of Physiology & Behavior showed that 
children who ate oatmeal performed better on cognitive tests compared 
to children who ate regular ready-to-eat cereals.
Some kids enjoy healthful foods and are eager to try new things at mealtime. 
But if your children aren’t ready for a lot of superfoods, don’t worry. With 
a little patience and time, they’ll eat superfoods on a regular basis. The 
following sections provide you with strategies to make eating superfoods 
painless.

185
 Chapter 12: Getting Your Family Onboard
Taking it one superfood at a time
Kids aren’t always interested in foods that are good for them; they want 
foods that taste good. Salmon and broccoli may not be able to compete with 
cheeseburgers and fries. This can present a bit of a challenge at mealtime.
 
The key is to avoid overwhelming your kids by making an overnight transfor-
mation to the meals they normally eat. Instead, take it slowly and introduce 
the superfoods one at a time, starting with superfoods that are sweet or 
crunchy.
Children naturally prefer sweeter flavors, so start with the superfood fruits. 
Superfoods such as bananas, oranges, and berries are great because they’re 
easy to eat and delicious. Although whole fruits are better than juice because 
they have pulp and fiber, 100 percent orange juice, apple juice, and pome-
granate juice are still great beverages for kids. Juice has a lot of sugar, even if 
the manufacturer doesn’t add any, so add some fresh spring water to dilute 
the juice. If you start children off on diluted juice early, they won’t get used 
to the really sweet taste of straight juice; use a ratio of about two or three 
parts juice to one part water.
If your kids are big on peanut butter, you may find it quite easy to get them to 
eat nuts and seeds like walnuts, pecans, and pumpkin seeds. Nuts and seeds 
make great snacks and can be chopped and sprinkled on a number of foods.
 
Because of the risk of developing allergies, you should be cautious about 
introducing nuts to kids before the age of 2. If food allergies run in your family, 
you may want to wait until your child is at least 4 years old. Also, grind the 
nuts finely, as nuts are a choking hazard before the age of 4.
Vegetables may be a little more difficult. The flavor of vegetables doesn’t 
appeal to a lot of children, which is unfortunate because they’re so good 
for you. Try starting with carrots, which are a little sweeter than green 
vegetables. (See the “Disguising superfoods” section later in this chapter for 
more tips.)
If your kids don’t like crunchy vegetables, go ahead and cook them until 
they’re very tender. Even though overcooking tends to reduce some of 
the nutritional content, a serving of mushy broccoli still beats a bag of fries 
any day.
 
Truly picky eaters may need to be exposed to new foods dozens of times 
before they’re ready to eat and enjoy them. (See the “Pleasing picky eaters” 
section later in this chapter.) Be patient, and keep serving superfoods along 
with your kids’ regular fare.

186
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Getting kids to help in the kitchen
Your kids may be more eager to try superfoods if they lend a hand in the 
kitchen. Learning how to cook can be a lot of fun for kids — as well as for the 
adult in charge.
Of course, you have to teach cooking skills that are appropriate for a child’s 
age. You don’t want to hand a 4-year-old a butcher knife, but he can help stir 
waffle batter, whereas a 12-year-old may be ready to learn how to peel and 
chop carrots. Here are some tips for teaching kids to cook:
 
✓ Begin with safe and healthy habits. Make sure everyone washes their 
hands. Teach your kids not to lick their fingers and hands; if they want a 
taste, have them use a clean spoon. Be sure that long hair is back in a 
ponytail and that no one is wearing any loose clothing that could pose 
a danger (such as catching fire from the stove or getting caught in an 
electric mixer).
 
 Don’t let your kids taste anything that contains raw meat or raw eggs; it 
could lead to your child contracting a food-borne illness. Thoroughly 
rinse your superfoods such as apples, berries, and carrots prior to 
eating to make sure there are no chemicals or debris on the skins. You 
can purchase produce rinses at your local supermarket, but you don’t 
have to spend the money; washing them in tap water is fine.
 
✓ Choose recipes together. Grab a cookbook or go online to find some 
recipes, and have your children read the ingredients list. Ask them to 
search for recipes with a superfood or two and choose one they want to 
help you make.
 
✓ Gather the ingredients. With a little guidance, young children can help 
you collect the ingredients. Older children can help open cans and 
containers. In the process, you may take advantage of the opportunity 
to make a few discreet comments about the health benefits that the 
superfood ingredients you’re using provide.
 
✓ Let them help mix and cook. Small children can help with stirring, 
although you don’t want them to stir anything on the stove because it’s 
too easy for them to burn themselves. But they can hand you things, like 
the pepper shaker or potholder, and learn by watching you. Older kids 
can learn to use mixers, blenders, and food processors. They can also 
help with some of the cooking under your watchful eye.
 
Give your kids lots of encouragement, and don’t worry about the inevitable 
messes and mistakes. Learning to cook should be a fun experience.

187
 Chapter 12: Getting Your Family Onboard
Making superfoods fun
Use your child’s interests, schoolwork, games, and hobbies to help introduce 
them to some of the superfoods. Find out what countries your kids are 
studying in geography class and look for superfoods from those regions. If 
they’re studying the Middle East, for example, you can make Hummus and 
Pita (see the recipe in Chapter 19), or serve salmon when they’re learning 
about Alaska.
You can also take your kids to the farmers’ market when you go shopping 
and let them help you pick out the produce. You might even consider 
planting a garden with your kids. Just keep it simple: Most kids don’t want 
to spend their whole summer weeding a garden, but they may be happy to 
tend to some tomatoes grown in flower pots.
Substitute superfoods in some of your kids’ favorite recipes. If your kids like 
“ants on a log” (celery sticks with peanut butter, topped with raisins), for 
example, make them with dried cranberries and almond butter instead.
 
Kids also like foods they can dip. Serve apple wedges with warm caramel 
sauce or let them dip baby carrots in a sweet salad dressing or their favorite 
chip dip. Just make sure that they’re actually eating the superfoods and not 
just licking off the dip!
Pleasing picky eaters
Some kids will eagerly try any new foods, but some kids (and even some 
adults) are just picky eaters. (Let’s face it: There are plenty of adults who 
don’t want to give up their meat and potatoes. Maybe you’re one of them!) 
Feeding a picky eater can be very frustrating, and it takes a lot of patience.
Why are some kids so darned picky? It may be in their genes. According to an 
article in the March 1998 issue of Pediatrics, your genetics may influence your 
eating patterns, especially during childhood. For example, many people are 
born with a dislike of the bitter flavors found in many vegetables. They have 
a stronger preference for sweet flavors. Fortunately, most kids outgrow their 
picky eating stage and eventually eat a normal diet. But while you’re waiting 
for your picky eater’s taste buds to grow up, you can try these ideas in the 
kitchen to help them along.
 
As a parent or grandparent, you set an example for your picky eaters 
whenever you eat something new and healthful.

188
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Being patient with youngsters
Dealing with a picky eater requires a lot of patience and understanding. 
Little kids can’t control much of anything that happens in their lives, but 
they can control what they eat — sort of. So some picky eaters are going 
to give parents and grandparents a rough time. Many family dinners have 
been ruined by shouting matches between parents and kids who refuse to 
eat their carrots, string beans, fish, or something else.
Mealtime is important, so keep dinnertime comfortable by refusing to battle 
with your child. Avoid threats and punishment; they don’t help. Instead, offer 
some foods you know your child likes alongside something new. If she 
refuses to eat it the first time she sees it, don’t get mad. If she refuses to eat it 
the tenth time she sees it, don’t get mad. Some experts believe it may take 
many exposures to a new food before kids are ready to try it.
As long as your children are healthy and growing normally, they’re 
probably getting enough nutrition despite being picky about the foods 
they eat. However, you may want to give them a children’s multivitamin, 
just to be sure.
 
Here’s more help for picky eaters:
 
✓ Avoid snacks and high-calorie beverages before mealtime. Your child 
may be more willing to try something new if he’s hungry.
 
✓ Offer new foods in small amounts. A spoonful of beets may not seem as 
daunting as a full serving.
 
✓ Don’t withhold dessert as punishment or offer extra dessert as a reward.
 
✓ Have your child help you pick out fruits and vegetables at the grocery 
store. This may help build a positive association with a new food.
 
✓ Don’t let your child play with toys, read a book, or watch television 
while eating. Picky eaters will use any excuse not to pay attention to 
their food.
 
✓ Let your picky eater experiment with condiments and toppings such 
as ketchup, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and mustard. He may find a 
combination that hits the spot.
Disguising superfoods
Sometimes picky eaters can be fooled if you disguise superfoods, especially 
vegetables, until they get used to the flavor and texture. One way to get 
your kids used to eating new foods is by topping them with something a little 
more familiar. Although this usually means adding a few extra calories with 
sweet or creamy sauces, it may be worth it to get your picky eater to enjoy 
something new.

189
 Chapter 12: Getting Your Family Onboard
 
Use a flavorful topping such as melted cheese, sweet-and-sour sauce, or a 
sweet glaze to enhance the flavor of vegetables. Another way to introduce 
your child to superfoods is by adding them to their favorite comfort foods.
Here are some ideas:
 
✓ Pour ginger sauce (or sweet-and-sour sauce) on cooked broccoli.
 
✓ Sweeten cooked carrots with a simple glaze. Cook one pound of carrots, 
add 1 tablespoon of canola oil and 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, 
and sauté for one or two minutes. Top with a dash of salt, pepper, and 
cinnamon.
 
✓ Sneak some spinach leaves into a salad along with the iceberg lettuce.
 
✓ Add cooked carrots or broccoli pieces to macaroni and cheese. Start 
with just a few pieces. Over time, add more vegetables to the mac and 
cheese.
 
✓ Top a pizza with tomato slices and spinach.
 
Some kids don’t like the texture of vegetables, but can handle the flavor. 
Vegetable purées are easy to make by cleaning and chopping your vegetables 
into small pieces and steaming or simmering them in water until tender. Place 
about 2 cups of cooked vegetables into a blender with a small amount of 
liquid, and purée until smooth. Serve with salt and pepper or your favorite 
seasonings.
Pairing Superfoods to Suit the 
Meat-and-Potatoes Set
We usually associate picky eating with children, but there are plenty of 
grown-ups who aren’t interested in changing the way they eat. Rather than 
making over an entire meal, just add a superfood or two. Your adult picky 
eaters can enjoy their usual meat-and-potatoes meal and still get the extra 
goodness of superfoods. Try these ideas:
 
✓ Begin dinner with a superfood salad. If your family isn’t ready for 
spinach leaves, stick with the iceberg lettuce and add tomatoes, 
walnuts, almonds, raw broccoli, and berries.
 
✓ Replace white bread with fine-textured whole-wheat bread. Once your 
family accepts that bread, bring in whole-grain breads made with whole 
wheat plus oatmeal, nuts, and seeds.
 
✓ Reduce the portion sizes for meat, which is high in saturated fats 
and calories. Fill the rest of the plate with a helping of potatoes and a 
delicious superfood vegetable.

190
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
 
✓ Turn mashed potatoes into a superfood side dish by adding cooked 
spinach or garlic.
 
✓ Add dried cranberries and walnuts to your favorite dressing or 
stuffing recipe, or to a boxed stuffing mix.
 
✓ Serve your baked potatoes with salsa as a topping instead of 
saturated-fat-laden sour cream, butter, or gravy.
 
✓ Serve glazed carrots as a side dish, or add shredded carrots to 
coleslaw and salads.
 
✓ Skip the sugary dessert. Serve sliced bananas and berries with a little 
whipped topping and walnuts.
 
Almost any meat-and-potatoes meal can be made healthier by adding a 
superfood or two. Of course, the way you prepare and cook your meat counts, 
too. Avoid deep-fried meats, processed meats, and hot dogs and sausages that 
contain nitrates (a chemical that has been linked to some forms of cancer). 
Choose lean meats, poultry, and fish whenever possible.
Serving Superfoods to Your Extended 
or Far-from-Home Family Members
Your family may include parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and even some 
cousins who don’t live with you, or you may have children in college or living 
on their own for the first time. Just because they aren’t under your roof, 
though, doesn’t mean you can’t help them eat more healthfully.
Helping elderly family members
Getting good nutrition is important for all stages of life, including old age. 
Help improve the health of older family members, especially those who 
live alone, by bringing superfoods into their diets (along with a big dose of 
happiness).
 
✓ Bring easy-to-heat meals. When you prepare dinner at home, make 
some extra portions to take to family members or friends who live 
alone. Include an entrée, such as a healthful salmon dish, and some 
side vegetables, such as carrots, beets, or kale. Pack the portions into 
microwave-safe containers for easy reheating.
 
✓ Make healthful snacks and fruit bowls. Make sure your relative has 
fresh fruits and vegetables prepared and ready to eat. Provide a fruit 
bowl filled with fresh fruit, or bring along some fresh vegetables (already 
peeled and sliced) with dip.

191
 Chapter 12: Getting Your Family Onboard
 
✓ Supply easy-to-prepare breakfast items. Bring boxes of dry cereals 
made with whole grains (especially oats and quinoa) and fresh berries 
to add extra nutrition to breakfast. When you prepare our breakfast muf-
fins (see Chapter 16 for the recipe), make a few extra to share.
 
✓ Invite them over for dinner. Elderly people who live alone often don’t 
meet their nutritional needs because eating alone just isn’t any fun.
Feeding college kids
Eating healthful foods may not be at the top of your college student’s list of 
things to worry about. Either they’ve hit the dietary jackpot by signing up for 
a meal plan at the college dining hall, or they’re living on their own, pinching 
pennies and trying to live off ramen noodles and peanut butter sandwiches.
Kids who go off to college are often victims of the freshman 15 — the extra 15 
pounds many students put on when they go to college. The weight gain may 
be due to buffet-style eating in the dining hall or just falling into a habit of 
buying and eating cheap junk foods like chips and cookies. Even though your 
kids may have had good eating habits while they were in high school, when 
they get to college, they don’t have the same supervision (or restrictions) 
they had as younger teens.
Although you have to let your adult children make their own dietary choices, 
you can help them out a little. Send a superfoods care package with bags 
of mixed nuts and pumpkin seeds, cans of tuna and salmon, homemade 
granola, and oatmeal blueberry muffins (see Chapter 16 for granola and 
muffin recipes).
 
Fresh fruits, such as apples, oranges, and bananas, and nuts and seeds don’t 
need refrigeration, so they’re perfect as healthful snacks. No need to keep 
bags of greasy chips and candy bars around the dorm room.
Some kids find college to be a stressful time, and stress can lead to eating too 
much comfort food or junk food. Help stressed-out college students find 
relief by showing them how to set up schedules, making their dorm space 
comfortable, or helping them find some type of regular exercise. Less stress 
means they’ll be less likely to load up on bad foods.
Share some easy superfood recipes with your college student, too. Superfood 
smoothie or protein shakes provide lots of nutrition and energy (see Chapter 
19) and are simple to make. You can also pass along this easy superfood 
sandwich spread recipe: Mix some chopped hardboiled eggs, a can of tuna, 
fat-free mayo, and some other veggies if you choose, and spread it onto some 
whole-wheat bread.

192
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
 
Boil a dozen eggs at a time and you can eat the eggs alone for a quick, easy 
snack. Pull out the yolk for an even healthier option.
If your college student has roommates, encourage them to buy foods like 
eggs, chicken, and veggies as a group and stock the fridge and freezer. They 
can then grill a bunch of chicken, boil a pot of eggs, or cut up a bunch of 
veggies to have available for quick salads, sandwiches, and snacks. Suggest 
they take turns preparing meals, which increases their chances of getting 
a good meal by reducing the number of times each person actually has to 
prepare it.

▶ Planning healthy meals
▶ Finding and shopping for superfoods
▶ Fitting superfoods into your budget
F
inding and incorporating superfoods into your diet may seem a little 
daunting at first, but it isn’t difficult once you have a game plan. 
Shopping for your superfoods diet may require a little more work, but with 
some simple strategies, you can streamline your shopping so that you can 
make fewer shopping trips, save money, and improve your health.
The best way to begin is by carefully creating meal plans around your super-
foods. Then you can use that information to make a grocery shopping list 
and, finally, hit the stores. It also helps to know how to read those black-and-
white Nutrition Facts labels you see on packaged foods so when you choose 
pre-packaged foods, you know how to choose the ones that are best for you 
and your family.
 
At the outset, you need to know which superfoods fit your needs best. 
Consumer Reports offers a number of free articles at www.consumerreports.
org/cro/food/diet-nutrition/index.htm; the articles cover diet and 
nutrition, including summaries of recent research. You also can subscribe to 
the site’s health newsletter for a small monthly or annual fee; a subscription

In this chapter, we guide you through the maze of shopping for superfoods. 
We show you what to look for and what to avoid, and we give you tips for 
finding the best superfoods no matter where you shop.

Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Planning Meals and Preparing 
Your Grocery List
Shopping for your superfoods diet begins at home. The following sections 
help you plan healthy meals and prepare a grocery list that makes superfood 
shopping a breeze.
Deciding what to make
Planning meals in advance helps you avoid a last-minute rush, which too 
often means sacrificing nutrition for convenience. It also saves money, 
because you won’t spend extra on take-out or at the drive-through.
Decide which meals you want to make for a week at a time, including break-
fast, lunches you take to work or school, dinners, snacks, and any extras for 
weekends. Choose meals and snacks that are healthy and give you your daily 
servings of superfoods (we suggest two or more — see Chapter 11).
 
Keep these things in mind when planning your meals:
 
✓ Choose healthful dishes. Look for recipes that include healthful ingredi-
ents (especially our superfoods) and the best cooking methods. Baking, 
steaming, roasting, and stir-frying are good for you; deep-frying is not.
 
✓ Save your favorite recipes. You can mark the pages in your cookbooks, 
copy recipes on paper and keep them in a file, or use online cooking 
sites to collect recipes and store them on your computer.
 
✓ Go for balance. Each meal should contain some protein from lean meat, 
dry beans, eggs, poultry, or fish; some high-fiber carbohydrates from 
whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and a little bit of healthy fat from 
nuts, seeds, and fish (that’s why fish and nuts are so super).
 
✓ If you have picky eaters, let them pick! A meal or two each week, that 
is. Getting your family involved (especially kids) helps reduce that ten-
dency they have to turn up their noses at anything new.
 
If your budget is tight (and whose isn’t, right?), check out the “Saving Money 
on Superfoods” section later for more meal-planning advice that helps you 
save money on superfoods.

195
 Chapter 13: Shopping for Superfoods
Making a list (and checking it twice)
After you have your meals planned for the week, you’re ready to make your 
shopping list. A healthy superfoods shopping list should contain your every-
day bulk and pantry-stocking items plus the packaged foods or ingredients 
you need to make the meals and snacks you’ve laid out — including the 
superfoods you want to incorporate.
Write your weekly meal plan on a sheet of notepaper (or use a spreadsheet 
program on your computer) so that making your grocery list is a snap. 
Referring to your meal plan when you make your list tells you exactly which 
foods and ingredients you need to buy.
 
Keep track of those staple items you need, such as flour (whole wheat), sugar 
(just a little), rice, coffee, tea (black, green, and herbal), herbs, and spices, 
by keeping a grocery list handy in the kitchen and jotting down items as they 
become depleted. You won’t need to buy these goods every time you shop, 
but when you do, you can save money by buying them in bulk.
 
You may want to create a one- or two-page master, printable shopping list 
with all your basic pantry needs, to serve as a template for your weekly lists. 
Then, each week you can check off the basic items you need to restock, and 
add items that are specific to your weekly menus. This is much faster than 
starting a new list from scratch each time you need to shop.
So, which foods should be on your shopping list? Here are some ideas for you:
 
✓ Buy lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Many fruits and vegetables qual-
ify as superfoods because they have so many vitamins, minerals, and 
phytochemicals (natural compounds that keep you healthy).
 
 Everyone needs at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. 
Choose a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables to please everyone in 
your family.
 
✓ Make at least half of your grains whole. Whole grains are rich in fiber, 
so pick whole grains whenever possible — including bread and other 
baked goods, pasta, and cereals. Oatmeal is a superfood grain that you 
can find in some whole-grain breads and breakfast cereals.
 
 Read the labels on breads, grains, and pastas to be sure the products 
you choose are “100 percent whole grain.”
 
✓ Choose good protein sources. The best options are fish, poultry, lean 
meats, nuts, eggs, seeds, and legumes. Fish contain omega-3 fatty acids, 
so they should be included in two or three meals each week. Legumes, 
nuts, and seeds also contain healthful fats and fiber. Skinless chicken 
and lean cuts of meat can round out your grocery list.

196
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
 
 Limit fatty red meats, breaded meats, “fish sticks,” processed lunch 
meats, sausages, and hotdogs, all of which contain fats and additives 
that are bad for your health.
 
✓ Don’t overlook beverages. Instead of sugary soft drinks, add low-fat 
milk, fruit juices, and herbal teas to your shopping list. Orange, pome-
granate, and apple juice are all superfood beverages as long as they 
contain 100 percent juice (check the labels). Sparkling water makes a 
healthful and simple beverage, too. Jazz it up with a wedge of lemon or 
lime, or make your own soft drink by mixing one part sparkling water 
with one part 100 percent fruit juice.
 
✓ Include some dairy products. Choose low-fat or nonfat milk, low-fat 
cheese, and yogurt. If you don’t like dairy products or are lactose intol-
erant, you can choose calcium-fortified orange juice or soy beverages 
and soy/vegetarian cheese substitutes.
 
✓ Add dressings, oils, and condiments. Choose salad dressings made 
with olive or walnut oil, look for low-fat mayonnaise, and buy margarines 
made without trans fats (which can damage your arteries). Choose olive 
oil and canola oil for cooking. Both contain healthy fats that regular veg-
etable oils don’t have.
 
✓ Buy some sandwich fixings. A sandwich can make a quick and healthy 
meal or snack, so include some healthy sandwich ingredients on your 
shopping list. Use whole-grain breads, with nut butters or low-fat turkey 
or chicken as your protein sources. Make your sandwiches super by 
adding tomatoes, spinach leaves instead of lettuce, or avocado slices.
 
✓ Choose healthy dessert and snack foods. Look for whole-grain crack-
ers (low in sodium whenever possible), baked chips, yogurt cups, fresh 
or dried fruits, nut and seeds, string cheese, fresh raw vegetables, and 
a small amount of dark chocolate. Make sure all your snack choices are 
nutritious — or at least dip those chips in guacamole or salsa.
In addition to deciding which foods to buy, you have to decide which form to 
buy them in. Fresh foods are always best, but frozen and canned foods can 
serve as acceptable substitutes. Just keep these tips in mind:
 
✓ Shop smart for frozen foods. Buying frozen foods is a convenient way to 
keep vegetables, seafood, and poultry on hand. Some brands of frozen 
vegetables are super-convenient — you just toss the bag in the micro-
wave, and they steam themselves in a few minutes.
 
 Although some frozen foods are both convenient and healthy, don’t rely 
on frozen meals to improve your health. Most are high in calories, fat, 
and sodium. A few brands of frozen meals are made with healthier ingre-
dients, but they’re typically very expensive and, in many cases, still high 
in sodium.

197
 Chapter 13: Shopping for Superfoods
 
 Instead of purchasing frozen pizza, buy whole-grain pizza crusts, a jar of 
pizza sauce (a great way to get lycopene-rich tomatoes), and cheese 
(experiment with flavorful cheeses such as feta or cheddar — you won’t 
need as much). Top your pizza with spinach and tomato slices, and 
follow the baking instructions on the crust packaging for healthier 
pizzas that are almost as fast as their frozen counterparts.
 
✓ Get the right kinds of canned and jarred food. Some canned foods 
are better than others. Look for low-sodium soups, vegetables, and 
sauces. Choose canned fruits that aren’t packed in sugary syrups. 
Avoid canned spaghetti, ravioli, and other high-calorie foods that aren’t 
very high in nutrition. Healthful choices include legumes, tuna packed 
in water, canned salmon, tomato sauce, and applesauce. Don’t forget 
about peanut butter (or, better yet, almond butter) and 100 percent fruit 
spreads.
Making Your Purchases
It’s shopping time, so grab your grocery list and jump in the car. No, wait a 
minute. Make sure you eat a healthy snack (like an apple or peanut butter 
sandwich) before you go, because grocery shopping on an empty stomach 
often leads to buying too many treats and snacks you don’t need. When your 
stomach is full, it’s much easier to stick with your superfoods list.
Now you’re ready to head out the door. But before you can begin shopping, 
you need to know where to go. It’s also helpful to know how to make the 
best selections and how to interpret the package labels on the foods you’ll 
encounter. The following sections give you the lowdown.
Checking out your store options
Wherever you do your shopping, you need to understand that not all super-
foods are created, or sold, equally. Finding the best quality and prices for 
your superfoods may require you to get out there and shop around to see 
what’s available.
Many superfoods are common, everyday foods, so finding them isn’t that 
difficult (unless you’re looking for a specific seaweed imported from Japan — 
that may require a bit of patience). Superfoods and other organic products 
are widely available in supermarkets everywhere, and this healthy trend 
doesn’t show any signs of ending any time soon.

198
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Consumers are increasingly demanding superfoods, so many conventional 
grocery stores are bulking up their inventories. A trip through the produce 
section of any grocery store offers many healthful fruits and vegetables, and 
you can always find fresh, frozen, or canned tuna or salmon.
You can also explore other sources for your superfoods, however. Established 
retail health food chains such as Whole Foods Market and Trader Joe’s have 
set the standard as the go-to locations for superfoods. Small, local health 
food co-ops also offer superfoods, usually in a friendly and knowledgeable 
atmosphere.
Starting local
Everyone would love to have the superfoods marketplace epicenter within 
walking distance of their house, but for most people this just isn’t the case. 
This doesn’t mean you can’t score big in your local community, though, so 
don’t give up on superfoods too easily.
The first thing to do is identify all your local shopping sources. Small towns 
and neighborhoods may have only one grocery store or a convenience shop, 
while larger cities have many big-box retail chain stores and a handful of 
natural or organic stores to choose from, as well as a couple of farmers’ mar-
kets. You can locate all of them through Web sites, newspaper ads, and the 
local Yellow Pages. Once you have a blueprint of the available resources, you 
can start your investigation.
 
Ask friends and neighbors where they find the best produce and selection of 
superfoods. They may know of places that aren’t on your radar yet.
Don’t worry if none of those big, fancy whole-foods stores are close by. 
Whether you live in a small town or a big bustling city, you can still find most 
of what you’re looking for at your local grocery stores, even the small ones.
There are also plenty of small specialty shops owned by health-conscious 
individuals who have an interest in superfoods and go the extra distance to 
bring quality to their consumers. You might just have one of these health 
food stores right in your own neighborhood.
Finding value at the big-box stores
If you’re looking for a greater selection at a lower cost, you may need to 
explore the larger retail chain stores. Just remember that while big stores 
can bring big savings, there may be a big cost in terms of quality. Sometimes 
freshness is lacking in the produce section, and some of the cheaper brands 
have less nutritious ingredients.

199
 Chapter 13: Shopping for Superfoods
Retail chains usually have much bigger inventories than the smaller, privately 
owned “mom and pop” grocery stores. Sometimes known as “big-box stores,” 
retail chains such as Super Target, Wal-Mart, Safeway, and Kroger routinely 
have better pricing because they can order in much larger quantities. But as 
we stated earlier, quantity doesn’t always mean quality. Retail chains also 
like to move things off the shelves quickly, so, if superfoods don’t sell, these 
stores won’t stock them.
Discount clubs that require membership, such as Sam’s Club and Costco, offer 
the biggest potential for savings. However, the best bargains at the store are 
not necessarily the most economical at home. For example, paying less for a 
huge bottle of olive oil may sound like a great deal, but if most of that oil goes 
to waste, you end up losing money. You also need to watch out for cheap, 
over-processed junk foods that contain too much sugar, saturated fats, trans 
fats, and sodium. Remember, low prices may not mean good nutrition.
 
When it comes to long-lasting items such as dry beans, oatmeal, frozen foods, 
and canned tuna, you may be able to save a lot of money by buying in bulk at 
the members-only clubs. Just be sure you know what the price is at your gro-
cery store so that you can comparison shop before you make your purchases 
at places like Sam’s Club or Costco.
Exploring the superfoods stores
The superfoods philosophy may not have hit your neighborhood market yet, 
but the trend is growing. This is evidenced by the rise of stores that cater to 
the health-conscious consumer, like Whole Foods Market and Trader Joe’s 
(see the nearby sidebar for their stories). These two retailers account for a 
large percentage of the dollars being spent on health foods, including super-
foods, and they’re gaining new consumers daily. Leading the way are baby 
boomers looking for ways to improve their health and vitality.
You can find the locations of Whole Foods Market and Trader Joe’s near-
est you by checking their store locators online: www.wholefoodsmarket.
com/stores/all/index.php and www.traderjoes.com/locations.
asp. You can also search online for “natural foods markets” or “health food 
stores” along with the name of larger cites in your area to locate health food 
stores. Your phone book is another place to search for health food stores.
When you shop at the superfoods stores, be sure to read Nutrition Facts 
labels and ingredient labels, just like you would at a regular grocery store. 
Even some natural products are high in sodium. Also note which items are 
organic and which ones are not; you’ll pay more for organic foods, but it may 
be worth the extra cost, especially for fresh produce that doesn’t have pesti-
cide residues.

Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Reaping the rewards of farmers’ markets
Imagine getting all the supermarkets to bring their produce sections to a 
parking lot and display them so you could select the best available. Well, 
that’s the exact setup of a farmers’ market. Brilliant, isn’t it?
Most consumers assume that if they go to a farmers’ market, they’ll have 
their choice of freshly picked produce. This may not exactly be the case — 
the produce may have been picked as much as a week earlier — but produce 
at farmers’ markets is still likely to be fresher than what you usually find at 
your supermarket. In addition, many smaller farmers who sell their goods at 
farmers’ markets grow organic produce and help save our soils by staying 
away from potentially harmful pesticides. What better way to support them 
than by buying their fruits and vegetables?
Some markets have grown into popular shopping grounds and can quickly 
become a regular pit stop in your morning routine. Often the weekend markets 
can provide excellent produce, but possibly more important is the information 
you can get if you talk to some of the seasoned vendors. You can count on 
finding fresh fruits and vegetables, but more and more markets are carrying 
additional superfoods like nuts, beans, herbs, and even fresh seafood.
Look in your local paper: Farmers’ markets are usually advertised or listed. 
You can also check with local grocers, chefs, or even friends to find out 
whether they know of any quality markets. Other popular places for farmers 
to set up shop are flea markets and roadside stands. These are great oppor-
tunities to get their products in front of a large number of people.
 
Farmers’ markets rarely have any problems regarding product safety, but you 
must understand that they are not regulated. Until you establish a good rela-
tionship with the vendors, you must exercise care in purchasing any products. 
Choose fresh-looking produce with no signs of mold or bruising.
 
Farmers have been feeling the crunch of economic decline. Buying directly 
from them is an excellent way to support your local community. Most of the 
time, you benefit from this buying arrangement too, getting fresh produce at 
a fraction of the price for which it’s sold at the supermarkets. If you haven’t 
been to a farmers’ market, blow the dust off your old recipe books and plan 
some healthy meals with fresh, locally grown produce.
 
Check out www.farmersmarket.com or www.localharvest.org to find 
farmers’ markets and other organic food growers near you.
Surfing for superfoods on the Web
It’s easy to find apples, bananas, and spinach at any grocery store, but 
quinoa, wheat grass, and chia seeds may be more difficult to find, depending 
on where you live. Fortunately, you can turn to the Internet to order your 
superfoods and have them delivered right to your front door.

201
 Chapter 13: Shopping for Superfoods
Many Web sites offer superfoods and dietary supplements. How do you know 
which Web sites to trust? Here are some things to think about when you’re 
looking for superfoods online:
 
✓ Look for contact information beyond an e-mail address. Every good 
Web site will have phone numbers or a physical address. If you aren’t 
comfortable with ordering products online, call the company and 
request a catalog.
 
✓ Look for seals of approval. The Better Business Bureau Online or the 
TRUSTe seals are prominently displayed by reputable Web sites.
 
✓ Check out nutrition information and ingredients, just as you would in 
a bricks-and-mortar store. If the site doesn’t offer easy-to-find links to 
nutrition information, go to a different Web site.
 
✓ Check shipping charges and estimated delivery times for your loca-
tion. Find out whether you need to sign for your delivery. Note: Some 
companies base their shipping charges on total price while others 
charge by the pound.
 
✓ Check out the return policy. In most cases, you won’t be able to return 
a food product after you’ve opened the package, unless the product 
is somehow defective. If you’re trying something new, order a small 
amount at first to see whether you like it.
Dedicated to healthful eating: 
Whole Foods Market and Trader Joe’s
Whole Foods Market was founded in 1980 as a 
small health food store and has become a fast-
growing, all-natural retail giant. When Whole 
Foods Market first opened its doors, there were 
only a few natural food stores in the United 
States. Now Whole Foods Market alone has 
more than 250 locations in the United States, 
Canada, and the United Kingdom.
Whole Foods Market continues to pave the way 
for large corporations in the food and health 
industry. Whole Foods Market has established 
a strong presence with its dedication to healthy 
products, such as superfoods, as well as its 
attention to preserving the environment. It was 
the first supermarket to completely eliminate 
the use of plastic disposable bags to help pro-
tect the environment, and it hires employees 
whose sole purpose is to find ways to make the 
stores environmentally friendly.
Trader Joe’s, another superfoods retailer, 
opened in 1958 as a chain of convenience stores 
and now has more than 300 stores in 23 states. 
The stores took on a new focus in 1967, aiming 
for an environmentally friendly atmosphere and 
a large selection of organic and gourmet foods. 
Today, Trader Joe’s not only sells other manu-
facturers’ great products, but also has more 
than 2,000 private-label products ranging from 
frozen goods to wine.

Finding and choosing superfoods 
at the grocery store
If you opt to shop at a local grocery store, you can make the most of your 
shopping experience by taking the following notes into consideration:
 
✓ Know that most of the superfoods are going to be found along the 
perimeter of the store. Fruits and vegetables can be found in the pro-
duce section and fresh fish at the meat/seafood counter. The unhealthy, 
over-processed, sugary, and greasy stuff is usually in the middle aisles at 
eye level.
 
✓ Choose fresh fruits and vegetables carefully. Look for firm fruits with 
unblemished skins and no signs of mold or oozing fluids. Vegetables 
should be plump and firm. Find out whether the store stocks locally 
grown or organic produce.
 
 Organically grown fruits and berries may be better for your health because 
they aren’t treated with artificial pesticides. If your grocer doesn’t carry 
organic produce, maybe it’s because he doesn’t know his customers 
want it. Try asking the owner or manager to stock a small supply of 
organic produce for you and your superfood-conscious neighbors.
 
 Can’t find the fresh fruits and vegetables you want in the produce section, 
or need to store your produce for more than a few days? Go to the freezer 
section where you can find a variety of fruits and vegetables, including 
some out-of-season fruits and delicious vegetable blends (just watch out 
for high-calorie sauces). What could be easier than buying a bag of per-
fectly prepared broccoli all ready to steam right in your microwave?
 
✓ Select fish carefully. Fresh fish should smell clean (not “fishy”) and the 
flesh (both of whole fish or fillets) should be firm to the touch. The eyes 
should be clear and the gills should be bright. If you’re in doubt, don’t 
buy that trout.
 
 If fresh fish isn’t available, see whether the store carries frozen tuna or 
salmon steaks. Of course, all stores carry at least some variety of canned 
tuna, and some even carry canned salmon and sardines.
 
✓ Don’t consider meat color to be the best indicator of freshness. You 
can tell more from the aroma and the feel of the meat, which should 
smell fresh and be firm to the touch — not slimy or sticky. Check the 
freshness date on the label.

203
 Chapter 13: Shopping for Superfoods
 
Prevent cross-contamination due to leakage that may occur with packaged 
fresh meats. Grab a couple of clear plastic bags from the produce section and 
slip your packaged raw meats into the bags to keep juices away from your 
other grocery items.
Reading food labels
The U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all packaged foods to 
carry Nutrition Facts labels that tell you about the nutritional content of the 
foods you’re looking to buy (see Figure 13-1). These black-and-white labels 
are found on the back, side, or bottom of the package. Knowing how to read 
food labels will help you make healthier decisions when you’re shopping for 
your foods — both superfoods and your regular groceries. It only takes a 
minute or two to find out what you need to know.

Grass-fed versus corn-fed beef
Red meat such as beef is not considered a 
superfood, but some types of beef may be 
better than others. Organic beef comes from 
cattle that are not given growth hormones and 
are raised on grass. This beef has a higher 
omega-3 fatty acid content than traditional 
corn-fed beef. Other, healthier forms of red 
meat include bison, venison (deer), and elk, all 
of which contain much less fat than beef.

204
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Serving information
The top part of the Nutrition Facts label shows serving size and servings per 
container. Knowing how many servings are in a package is very important so 
you can decipher the rest of the nutritional information.
 
Serving sizes can be a little tricky. Look at the label on a can of condensed 
soup, for example. You may think that one can is one serving, but it’s really 
two or three servings.
 
The nutrition information on the rest of the label is for one serving of the 
product. If you eat the whole can, bag, or box, you have to multiply all the 
nutrition information by the number of servings to get the whole story of what 
you’re consuming.

The largest section of the Nutrition Facts label shows you the number of calo-
ries per serving along with the amount of fat (information about saturated fat 
and trans fat is required if there’s more than half a gram per serving; informa-
tion about other fats is optional), carbohydrates (including sugars and fiber 
if there’s more than 1 gram per serving of either), and protein each serv-
ing contains. It also shows the sodium content, which is very important to 
people who need to watch their blood pressure, and how much cholesterol 
the food contains, which is especially important for those with high choles-
terol levels.
The information is stated in grams or milligrams and as a Daily Value percent-
age for a typical daily diet of about 2,000 calories. You don’t need to take a 
calculator to the store with you to count every calorie or gram of fiber, but 
this part of the label gives you a good overall view of the general nutrition 
content of the product. For example, the Nutrition Facts label for one particu-
lar brand of macaroni and cheese shows that one serving has 400 calories, 15 
grams of total fat (23 percent daily value), and 820 milligrams of sodium (34 
percent daily value). So, this one serving of macaroni and cheese contains 20 
percent of your daily calories (assuming you limit consumption to 2,000 calo-
ries a day), almost one-quarter of the fat you need for a whole day, and more 
than one-third of your recommended sodium intake. And this is for what is 
traditionally a side dish — not an entire meal. That doesn’t mean you can’t 
have macaroni and cheese. But it does mean you should watch how much fat 
and sodium, as well as total calories, you eat for the rest of the day.
Vitamins and minerals
The next part of the Nutrition Facts label gives a little more information 
on selected vitamins and minerals besides sodium. The FDA requires the 
amounts of calcium, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C to be listed on the label, 
even if there aren’t any. Sometimes you’ll see information for other nutrients 
such as folic acid (a supplemental B vitamin) or thiamine (another B vita-
min), if the food manufacturer chooses to show them.

 Chapter 13: Shopping for Superfoods
Ingredients list
Packaged foods have to list the ingredients in order from greatest to least. 
This is helpful if you’re looking to avoid, limit, or include specific ingredients. 
For example, some fruit juices contain water, sugar, or high-fructose corn 
syrup as additional ingredients. Of course, reading the ingredient list also 
points you to superfoods when you find ingredients like olive oil, soy, or 
garlic on the label.
What else you might see on the label
The Nutrition Facts label isn’t the only source of information on packaged 
foods. Packages are often emblazoned with words like “natural,” “organic,” 
or “light,” but they don’t always mean what you think they do. Here are a few 
facts to think about when reading food packages:
 
✓ How organic is “organic”? Foods labeled as “100% organic” must con-
tain all organically grown ingredients except for added water and salt. 
The word “organic” can be used on the label if more than 95 percent of 
the ingredients are organic, and the words “made with organic ingre-
dients” can be used on the label if 70 percent of the ingredients are 
organic. (See the nearby sidebar for more on the meaning of “organic.”)
 
✓ What do words like “low,” “reduced,” or “-free” really mean? Low-
calorie foods contain less than 40 calories per serving. Low-fat foods 
contain less than 3 grams of fat per serving. Low-sodium foods contain 
less than 140 grams of sodium per serving. Foods with “reduced” on the 
label (like “reduced sugar” or “reduced calorie”) must contain at least 
25 percent fewer calories than the regular version of the same product. 
Calorie-free foods have less than 5 calories per serving, and fat-free 
foods can have up to 0.5 grams of fat per serving. The same holds for 
sugar: Foods can have 0.5 grams of sugar and still be labeled sugar-free.
 
✓ Are those health claims real? The FDA allows certain health claims to 
be made on food labels. In some cases, labels may state that certain 
ingredients may affect normal structure or function of the body, such as 
“fiber maintains bowel regularity,” but may not state that an ingredient 
prevents or treats disease. Dietary supplement labels must state that 
the product “is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any dis-
ease” because their claims are not evaluated by the FDA. A few qualified 
health claims are allowed on labels, such as “Scientific evidence sug-
gests but does not prove that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts as 
part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of 
heart disease.” In these cases, the labels must adhere to strict wording 
that is determined by the FDA.
 
✓ What’s the difference between “made with” and “100 percent” labels? 
When you buy whole-grain products and fruit or vegetable juices, be 
sure to look for the label “100%” (and double-check the ingredient list). If 
a bread label, for example, states, “made with whole grains,” it may not 
contain many. Likewise, many fruit juice beverages contain as little as 10 
percent actual juice — and often lots of sugar.

206
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
 
Despite the FDA’s intentions to control the wording on labels, some products 
still offer claims of amazing cures. Approach these with caution. Not only are 
the “cure” claims suspect; some of these products may actually harm your 
health rather than help it.
Saving Money on Superfoods
Eating healthfully can get expensive, but, with a little planning, you can enjoy 
healthy, superfood-rich meals without spending a fortune.
 
Here are some tips to get the nutrition you need without blowing your budget:
 
✓ Look at grocery store ads and coupons when making out your weekly 
meal plan. That way, you can select meals based on food items that are 
on sale. You can also find coupons online at sites like www.coupons.
com. At www.smartsource.com, you can print out your coupons on 
your own. Some other sites, like www.grocerycoupons.net, have you 
place an “order” for the coupons you want, and then they’re mailed to 
you. If you’re not sure what you want, search for “grocery coupons” and 
tour various sites to see how they work.
 
✓ Plan several uses for perishable ingredients so they’re less likely to go 
to waste. For example, if you plan to make our oatmeal blueberry muf-
fins from Chapter 16 for breakfast on Monday, think about serving blue-
berries and whipped topping for dessert on Wednesday.
 
✓ Buy the whole bird. Chicken is a good source of protein and is low in fat 
when you remove the skin. Pre-cut chicken is convenient, but it’s much 
more expensive than buying the whole bird and cutting it up yourself — 
unless you can catch the pre-cut stuff on sale at the grocery store.
What is organic?
According to the United States Department of 
Agriculture,
 
 “Organic meat, poultry, eggs and dairy 
products come from animals that are given 
no antibiotics or growth hormones. Organic 
food is produced without using most con-
ventional pesticides, fertilizers made with 
synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge, 
bioengineering or ionizing radiation.”
Organic foods may not contain more vitamins 
or minerals than traditionally grown or raised 
foods. However, going organic reduces your 
exposure to pesticide, antibiotic, and growth 
hormone residues.

207
 Chapter 13: Shopping for Superfoods
 
✓ Make plans for your leftovers. Leftover baked salmon fillets (see 
Chapter 17) could be used to make salmon cakes (see Chapter 19). If you 
have a refrigerator and microwave at work, leftovers can also be part of 
a healthful and delicious lunch.
 
✓ Make your own frozen meals. Double your recipes and freeze half of 
them for use at a later time. Freeze the foods in microwave-safe contain-
ers or make aluminum foil pouches that can be warmed up in the oven.
 
✓ Stock up on sale items. Bulk items like dry beans and oatmeal and 
canned goods like black beans, tuna, and salmon have long shelf lives, 
so buy them when they’re on sale and use them when you’re ready.
 
✓ Buy produce only when you plan to use it. Check the sell-by dates on 
things like bagged spinach, and pass it up if you don’t intend to use it by 
then. For all fresh produce, the general rule is to buy only as much as 
you’ll use within a week, especially for items that don’t freeze well.
 
✓ Buy family-sized packages of lean meats, chicken, and superfood fish 
fillets when they’re on sale. Repack extra steaks, chops, chicken pieces, 
or fillets in freezing paper or freezer bags and freeze them for future use.
 
✓ Substitute other protein sources for meat. Black beans, pinto beans, len-
tils, and other legumes contain enough protein to take the place of meat 
in a meal and are far less expensive. Make your burritos with black beans 
instead of beef — you’ll save money and get healthy at the same time.
 
✓ Make your own snacks. Combine whole-grain oat cereals like Cheerios 
with dried fruits and a variety of nuts (and even a few dark chocolate 
chips). Place individual portions in small snack-sized bags for portable, 
money-saving treats.
 
✓ Buy fresh produce when it’s in season. Not only is it cheaper, but fol-
lowing the seasons is also a nice way to add variety to your meals. Many 
fruits and almost all vegetables can be frozen, so you can buy extra to 
enjoy during the off-season, too.
 
✓ Grow your own superfoods. Starting a home garden can be a great 
hobby and save you money on some of the foods that you use often. 
Even an herb garden can be cost-effective and convenient. (See Chapter 
14 for more on starting your own garden.)
 
For more financial advice, see the earlier section “Finding value at the big-box 
stores” to find out about the pros and cons of shopping at large retail chain 
stores and buying in bulk.

N
aturally, you want your superfoods to be both healthy and safe — and, 
ideally, less expensive. A good way to achieve all these goals is to grow 
your own superfoods garden. In this chapter, we show you the advantages of 
growing your own superfoods, explore the different kinds of gardens you can 
cultivate, and share tips and tricks for tending and getting the most out of 
your superfoods garden.
 
We focus on superfoods gardening here, but we don’t have the space to 
give you an encyclopedic knowledge of gardening. For that, we recommend 
Gardening Basics For Dummies by Steven A. Frowine and Organic Gardening 
For Dummies by Ann Whitman, both written in association with the National 
Gardening Association and published by Wiley. Sustainable Landscaping For 
Dummies by Owen E. Dell is another Wiley title that includes info about grow-
ing a healthy and safe garden.
Assessing the Advantages of Starting 
Your Own Superfoods Garden
Growing a garden that’s bursting with healthy produce is a great accomplish-
ment. Not everyone has the extra time to venture into a new hobby, but 
having at least one pastime is important to stimulate your mind and control 
stress levels. Besides the mental aspect, there are several other important 
reasons to grow your own superfoods. Not only can you fill your refrigerator 
and pantry with healthy foods, but you can also pad your pocketbook. That’s 
right — starting your own garden can save you money. So read on to get 
everything you can out of a superfoods garden.

210
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
When you shop in any grocery store, you don’t have control of the growing 
and processing of the foods you eat. But by starting your own superfoods 
garden, you can control growing and harvesting conditions so there are no 
questions about what your superfoods went through to get to your table.
Probably the most fun part of building your own garden is choosing what to 
grow. You can start a standard garden with a variety of veggies, fruit trees, 
and berries, or even an herb garden. Of course, the best superfoods gardens 
have a few of each.
When you plan your meals around all the superfoods you want to eat, shop-
ping and cooking can get expensive, especially when you buy lots of organic 
foods and herbs. Starting your own garden can help expand your superfoods 
diet and save you money along the way.
You’re likely to find a small section in the produce department for herbs, 
plants, and exotic superfoods, often with a limited selection. These isolated 
items can be expensive and are often bundled in amounts that are more than 
you can use, so you may end up throwing some of them away. Having an 
herb garden allows you to fresh-pick what you need without wasting money 
on leftovers. If your garden yields more produce than you can use, you can 
preserve your harvest or share it with friends. What a great way to introduce 
them to superfoods and home gardening!
 
When environmental factors disrupt the growing seasons for commercial 
farmers, prices of the affected produce can skyrocket or the amount avail-
able may be reduced. If you grow your own, you won’t have to worry so much 
about those prices going up.
Planning Your Superfoods Garden
Building your superfoods garden can be a fun and exciting venture when you 
think about all the possibilities you have. Of course, growing takes time and 
you have to wait a little while to actually get a taste of your investment, but 
it’s worth it in the end.
The easiest way to get started is to make a list of everything you’ll need, 
because planning makes perfect. As with any do-it-yourself project, you may 
become a frequent flyer to your local gardening center, but starting with a 
detailed plan will help limit your driving time. The important thing to remem-
ber is that you can make your garden as big or as small as you want (you can 
even start with just one crop). Once you’ve decided which kind of garden you 
want, you can figure out what tools you’ll need to make your garden flourish.

211
 Chapter 14: Growing Your Own Superfoods
Deciding what kind of garden 
makes sense for you
Different types of gardens suit different needs and spaces. The best option 
for you and your family may end up being a combination of garden types, 
depending on how many superfoods you want to grow and how much room 
you have. Some types of gardens may be easier if you’re a rookie, but as you 
gain experience and enjoy the great rewards of gardening, you may look to 
expand. We look at the most common options for home gardening to help 
you decide which type of garden best suits you.
Traditional backyard gardens
Go out in the backyard, mark off a large square, and start diggin’ — you’ll 
have a garden in no time.
Okay, it’s not really that easy, but it’s a common starting point, especially 
for new gardeners. When you picture a stretch of land at the back of your 
lot with rows of fresh produce neatly plotted, you’re visualizing the typical 
backyard garden. To decide if this is a feasible option for you, here are a few 
things to consider:
 
✓ Decide which superfoods you want to grow. Some of the superfoods 
that do really well in backyard gardens are beans, tomatoes, broccoli, 
and spinach. You can also grow other great vegetables that didn’t make 
the superfoods list successfully in a backyard garden, too. If you want 
to grow only one or two superfoods, a different type of garden may be 
better, such as a container garden (see the next section).
 
✓ Find the right piece of land. Look for a flat place that receives as much 
sun as possible. In the northern states, you need almost full sunlight — 
that is, sun exposure eight hours a day. In southern climes, you may be 
able to get away with half that many hours of sunlight.
 
✓ Check the soil of the area you settle on. Is it garden-ready, or will you 
have to adjust the soil? We provide information about soil types later in 
this chapter in the section “Understanding soil types.”
 
✓ Measure off the maximum area you can allocate to the garden. 
Although you may have a large plot of land, it’s best to start with a 
garden about 10 feet by 10 feet. You can always expand later, but you 
don’t want to tear up a large plot of land in the beginning just in case 
you find that gardening isn’t really your thing.
 
✓ Make sure you have a water source for your garden location. One 
example is a garden hose that reaches from the faucet to your garden. 
Rainfall is seldom consistent in most areas, so you’ll need to supplement 
nature’s moisture with a watering schedule.

212
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
 
If you’re uncertain about your gardening abilities or interest, try starting with 
a single vegetable. Then, if you like, you can expand your garden — both in 
terms of size and variety of crops — in subsequent years.
Container gardens
Container gardens, as the name implies, use containers instead of a plot of 
land in which to grow produce. Container gardens are great if you’re a begin-
ner because they require less maintenance. They’re also a popular choice for 
those who don’t have the space for a traditional garden. Container gardens 
can be quite small, so most likely you can make room for one no matter 
where you live.
Container gardens allow you to plant a large variety of produce in a small 
area. They’re a common choice for herb gardens, which can be planted in 
window boxes and on balconies.
 
For much more on container gardens, check out Container Gardening For 
Dummies by Bill Marken and the editors of the National Gardening Association 
(published by Wiley).
Hydroponic gardens
The whole premise of hydroponic gardening is to grow produce without soil. 
This obviously has to be a complicated system that takes months to master, 
right? Not at all! It may take a bit more time to master, but, when done right, 
hydroponics can be a very effective way to grow superfoods with high nutri-
ent values indoors or outdoors. It’s especially useful for people who don’t 
have much outdoor space. You can grow a very diverse garden all within the 
confines of your home.
Hydroponic gardening also is useful when your climate isn’t right for the 
kind of plants you want to grow — especially smaller crops like herbs. 
Hydroponics lets you create the right environment for these plants to thrive.
Another advantage of hydroponics is that you can maximize nutrient absorption 
through your fertilizer mixes and yield really healthy, nutrient-rich produce.
 
To find out more about hydroponic gardening, we recommend Hydroponics 
for the Home Gardener by Stewart Kenyon and Howard M. Resh (Key Porter 
Books).
Indoor gardens
Indoor gardening requires many of the same considerations as outdoor gar-
dening, including soil and crop selection. The advantage to indoor garden-
ing is that you don’t have to contend with the vagaries of weather. You can 
establish much more consistent growing conditions, and you can grow your 
garden year-round. Indoor gardens usually have fewer pest problems, too.

213
 Chapter 14: Growing Your Own Superfoods
Indoor gardens do require more attention to watering schedules and light 
exposure. Mother Nature won’t destroy your indoor garden in a hail storm, 
but she also won’t drizzle a gentle rain on it or soak it in abundant sunshine. 
If you tend to forget to water your houseplants or don’t have a lot of natural 
light in your home, indoor gardening may not be your best option.
Figuring out which tools you need
Whatever type of garden you choose, you need an array of tools and supplies 
to make sure you can do it right the first time. Some standard tools are useful 
for all garden types, whereas some specific items are useful for certain types 
of gardens.
Starting with general gardening tools
You need some tools no matter what kind of garden you decide to start. 
Some of the smaller tools can be used for container and indoor gardens as 
well as traditional backyard gardens. If you have a large plot of land, you may 
want to invest in a rototiller (or rent one) to work up your soil before you 
plant your garden. Other must-haves include
 
✓ Gloves: Gloves aren’t just to keep the dirt out of your fingernails. They 
also help prevent blisters on your hands when you’re using gardening 
tools and protect your hands from cuts and scrapes.
 
 When working in soil, you have to be cautious about getting cuts and 
puncture wounds from thorns and other sharp objects. Tetanus bac-
teria can be found in soil, and it can get into your system through 
open wounds. Untreated, tetanus can lead to serious health conditions 
(including paralysis and lockjaw). Check with your doctor about your 
immunization status (you should have a booster shot every ten years), 
and be sure to cover any scratches or cuts with bandages before work-
ing in your garden.
 
✓ A shovel or spade: Both large and small shovels are convenient to have. 
You’ll probably use small gardening shovels more frequently, but you’ll 
need a larger one, too, for bigger jobs, such as planting superfood fruit 
trees. (See the nearby sidebar for the difference between a shovel and a 
spade and when you should use each tool.)
 
✓ A hoe: Hoes are designed to create troughs for planting seeds. They’re 
also useful for removing weeds.
 
✓ Rakes: As with shovels, having both hand-held and full-length rakes 
is helpful for gardening. Rakes are used to churn the soil and manage 
weeds. (You won’t need rakes for an indoor garden, and you may not 
even need one for a container garden.)
 
✓ Garden snips or loppers: These are bulky scissors for pruning plants, 
raspberry canes, and fruit trees.

214
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
 
✓ A watering mechanism: For smaller gardens, a simple watering can 
will do. For larger gardens, you’ll likely need a hose and a spray nozzle 
that allows you to drench your garden in a gentle shower. You also may 
want to consider a sprinkler, but be sure you can control the force of the 
water flow. Plants of all kinds do best with a slower, gentler flow of water 
that gives the soil time to absorb the moisture. High-pressure water flow 
often runs off the surface and can damage tender plants. For hydroponic 
gardens, you can get simple watering pumps that will recirculate and 
keep the water levels adequate.
 
✓ A cart: Unless you just get a kick out of running back and forth between 
your garden and your shed or garage (or wherever you store your gar-
dening tools and supplies), you’ll want to invest in a wheelbarrow or 
small wagon for your outdoor garden (obviously you won’t need one for 
indoor or container gardens). It’s much easier to cart your soil, fertilizer, 
seeds, and tools all at once. It comes in handy at harvest time, too.
Choosing containers
If you opt for a container garden, you don’t have to spend a lot on fancy con-
tainers. Consider using household items that you would normally throw out 
or recycle, such as coffee cans or cut-down milk cartons. These are ideal for 
small plants such as herbs, or to start seedlings that you’ll transplant out-
doors later in the spring, like tomatoes or peppers.
You can also purchase containers for your garden practically anywhere. 
Gardening centers, nurseries, and even discount retailers carry a variety of 
plastic, ceramic, or wood containers in season.
 
Plants grown in pots need good drainage to prevent being over-watered. If you 
use coffee cans or milk cartons, punch a few holes in the bottom to allow for 
drainage. Remember to place each container on a plate or tray to catch any 
overflow. If your containers don’t come with water trays, you can make your 
own with sturdy paper or Styrofoam plates, or you can look for a plastic serv-
ing platter or tray at your local dollar store. Just make sure that whatever you 
use has at least slightly raised sides to prevent leaks, and don’t over-water 
your container garden.
 
Add a layer of gravel to the bottom of your containers before adding your pot-
ting soil. This improves drainage. Don’t use dirt from your backyard in your 
containers or flowerpots because it probably won’t be the right texture for 
container gardening. Potting soil has better texture and nutrients for container 
plants.
Be sure to choose plants that will fit the container you’re using and not grow 
too big. The full-size orange tree that you’ve always wanted isn’t likely to 
thrive in your container garden, but miniature varieties of oranges, lemons, 
and limes are bred specifically for small spaces.

215
 Chapter 14: Growing Your Own Superfoods
Considering light sources
Some indoor gardens can survive on indirect sunlight that comes in through 
the windows, but if your home doesn’t allow for adequate light, you may 
need a grow light. These are easy enough to buy and install, and they can be 
placed on timers to keep the plants from burning or drying out.
 
Choose fluorescent light bulbs made especially for growing plants. Incandescent 
(regular) light bulbs won’t give your plants the type of light they need. Many 
garden centers and home improvement stores carry kits for growing plants 
indoors.
Keeping growing seasons in mind
In some ways, plants are like people. Some like it hot and sunny, some prefer 
shade and cooler temperatures, some do best in dry conditions, and some 
need more moisture to thrive. Some plant varieties are very sensitive to cer-
tain climates, and they may not deliver optimal taste or nutritional value in 
other settings. Think about grape vineyards. The farmers search for not only 
the best soil, but also the best climate to grow their grapes. This can spell the 
difference between a good wine and a great wine.
Keep growing seasons in mind when you plan your superfoods garden. 
Spinach and kale need to grow in the cooler temperatures of spring or later 
fall. Tomatoes may need to be started indoors (plant the seeds in small pots) 
and transplanted when the weather is warm enough (or you can buy plants 
that are ready to be transplanted).
 
The Farmer’s Almanac is an excellent source to determine the best time to 
grow your superfoods. You can go to www.farmersalmanac.com and pull 
up information specific to your area. Most commonly, growing charts are 
divided by north and south, but you may find specifics for east and west as 
well. Your local gardening center should be able to provide a growing chart 
that shows you the best times to grow specific superfoods in your area.
Should you use a shovel or a spade?
Shovels are designed to move dirt; spades are 
designed to loosen it. Shovels have pointed 
tips and a gooseneck handle, which help you 
lift dirt and deposit it somewhere else. Spades 
have square blades and straight handles, which 
make them ideal for prying and loosening. But 
you’ll work a lot harder if you try to use a spade 
to move dirt. If all you want to do is pry up sod 
and loosen the topsoil for your garden, use a 
spade. If you need to dig a large hole, use a 
shovel. For smaller holes, use a small gardening 
shovel (the kind that often comes with a hand-
rake for breaking up clumps of dirt).

216
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Selecting Your Superfood Seeds
Getting delicious superfoods from your garden starts with finding quality 
seeds, which is easier than ever. You can find seeds online, in catalogs, or at 
your local gardening center or big-box store, or you can ask vendors at your 
local farmers’ markets where they get their seeds.
 
Try to find organic seeds, which haven’t been exposed to chemicals or to 
genetic modification. Many companies such as High Mowing Seeds (www.
highmowingseeds.com) and Yardlover (www.yardlover.com) offer them. 
Note that international companies often offer a better variety of fruits, veg-
etables, and herbs. Check out the Organic Consumers Association Web site 
at www.organicconsumers.org. Click on Find Organics on the home page, 
and then select Organic Non-GMO Seeds under the Food menu for state-by-
state and international listings of companies that sell organic seeds.
Here are some more things to think about as you choose your super seeds:
 
✓ Decide what you want to grow. Many of the superfoods come in many 
varieties, including different sizes, shapes, and colors. Choosing the right 
seeds can make a big difference. For instance, if you’re salivating over 
large, voluptuous tomatoes, you don’t want to plant cherry tomato seeds.
 
✓ Choose the right seeds for your garden type. Container, hydroponic, 
and indoor gardens impose some limitations on the seeds you choose. It 
will be difficult to grow large tomatoes in these garden formats, but they 
do great in backyard gardens. Herbs and some of the smaller vegetables 
like cherry tomatoes, beans, and broccoli do well in container gardens, 
although they may require larger containers to flourish. Larger produce 
requires even larger containers. You may also try growing some sprouts 
such as chia and flax. If you’re interested in growing fruit, containers are 
great for growing strawberries.
 
✓ Consider your garden’s location. Some plants, like tomatoes, grow best in 
full sun, and some, like spinach, need a little shade. You also need to think 
about your soil type and the temperature. Carrots can stand heat but need 
lighter soil. Kale and spinach need cooler temperatures. If you’re confused 
by soil types, temperatures, full sun, partial sun, and drainage, talk to an 
expert at a garden center or contact your county extension office.
 
✓ Match crops with your climate. Ordering your plants and seeds from 
catalogs or online is convenient, but you need to exercise a little care. 
First, you need to locate your hardiness zone (every reputable catalog 
will have a map of the United States with the hardiness zones labeled 
in different colors). When you browse the catalog, be sure to read the 
description for the plants you want to grow to make sure they’ll grow 
and flourish in your zone. If you’re not comfortable ordering seeds 
online or from a catalog from some faraway place, shop locally. A local 
garden shop will only carry the seeds for plants that grow in your area.

217
 Chapter 14: Growing Your Own Superfoods
Enriching the Soil
Soil is a dynamic environment that needs to be monitored and protected 
if you expect it to produce the food that nourishes your body. Pesticides 
(chemicals that kill or repel insects, microorganisms, and even rodents) and 
herbicides (chemicals that kill unwanted plants) often leave residues on 
fruits and vegetables that may build up in your body. The great news is that 
you can have a successful garden without these chemicals.
The potting soil used for your container and indoor gardens is different from 
the soil in your yard. Potting soil is designed to allow roots to grow easily 
and to retain the right amount of water. Remember to use a layer of gravel at 
the bottom of your container to help extra water drain away so your roots 
don’t rot. If you have questions about potting soil, go to a local nursery or 
garden center and ask for some help.
For a backyard garden, you need to understand a bit more about soil and 
how it can impact the way your superfoods are grown.
Peeking into an underground ecosystem
To the naked eye, soil looks like . . . well, dirt. But there’s a busy, under-
ground system of life, or ecosystem, in those clumps of earth that works to 
keep the soil — and all that springs from it — healthy.
 
✓ Microorganisms, tiny living creatures that live in the ground, continu-
ously break down all the wastes and chemicals in the dirt and turn them 
into nutrients, creating a rich environment for farming.
 
✓ Macro-organisms, such as worms and larger bugs, make tunnels through 
the ground, giving the nutrients room to disperse into the soil.
Billions of organisms inhabit the soil, including bacteria, algae, and fungus. They 
use air, water, minerals, and heat from the sun, and cause reactions that make 
soil functional. They all play a role in creating the right environment for planting.
Ever wonder what happens to leaves, chewing gum, paper bags, and even 
engine oil when it gets into the soil? Macro- and microorganisms team up to 
decompose these and other substances, magically converting them into an 
enriched environment for plants to grow. These organisms are impressively 
effective at breaking down even the most extreme substances and repairing 
soil damage, although this can take quite a while to accomplish.
 
One way to judge whether you have good soil is by the number of large earth-
worms you find when you dig down beneath the topsoil. They may be a little 
slimy, but they can be a good guide to good soil. Large, plump earthworms 
indicate a soil environment rich in nutrients.

Understanding soil types
Soil types are made up of the gradual breakdown of rock and the decompo-
sition of plants, manure, and decaying animal matter. There are three main 
categories of soils that can support plant growth, but they have very different 
nutrient content. Differences in soil can make a major difference in the nutri-
ent content of the crops. The primary soil types are
 
✓ Clay soil. Clay soil is a good, fertile soil, but it can be difficult to work 
with because it’s hard to separate and can trap air and water, creating 
an unpleasant environment for plants. Clay soil tends to either dry out 
quickly or retain too much water, and either extreme presents a chal-
lenge for gardening.
 
✓ Sandy soil. Sandy soil is composed of mostly large particles that allow 
air and water to move relatively freely. But the nutrients can also drain 
right out of the soil, leaving little for the root systems of the plants to 
absorb. As with clay soil, sandy soil also can dry out quickly.
 
✓ Loamy soil. Loamy soil is the most desirable because it has a good 
mixture of all particle sizes, allowing for good air circulation and water 
drainage. This soil type has a higher percentage of organic matter and 
therefore offers the most natural fertile environment to grow in.
Many garden centers and home improvement centers offer soil testing as a 
service. Alternatively, you can buy a simple pH testing kit. To collect a soil 
sample, check with the garden center for instructions, which will be similar 
to this:
 
1. Collect a spade, some newspaper (or other clean paper), and a bucket.
 
 Clean the spade and bucket thoroughly to remove any type of residue 
that may alter the test results.
 
2. Dig four or five holes (about 8 inches deep) in different parts of your 
planting area to get a good sample of the soil in your garden.
 
3. Use the spade to slice out a portion of soil along the side of each hole. 
Place the slices of soil into your bucket.
 
4. Mix the soil in the bucket and spread the soil on newspaper to dry out.
 
5. Collect about a pint of soil (or whatever amount the garden center or 
home improvement store requires) as a sample.
Once you know the pH of your soil, you can adjust it as needed. You can add 
sulfur to the soil to lower the pH or you can add lime to the soil to increase 
the pH.

219
 Chapter 14: Growing Your Own Superfoods
The soil test may also tell you other information about your soil, such as the 
amounts of phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen. An expert can help you 
choose the best products for improving your soil.
Caring for Your Superfoods Garden
Your garden will need regular maintenance to keep your superfood plants 
healthy. All plants need the right amount of water, and you need to remove 
weeds so they don’t use up nutrients or choke out your plants. A little boost 
of the right type of fertilizer will help your superfood plants grow big and 
healthy, too.
With the right kind of TLC, your garden will reward you with a bounty of 
superfoods at harvest time. You’ll have plenty of fresh produce for your 
kitchen, and probably enough to give to friends and family besides. Of 
course, you can also freeze or can the extra produce to enjoy during the 
winter. Enjoying the fruits of your labor in January can be great motivation to 
plant a garden again the following spring.
Watering wisely
This seems like a no-brainer, but the correct balance of water is important for 
plant growth. If you’ve ever had houseplants die (or you’ve failed at previous 
gardening attempts), don’t give up on your green thumb yet. Maybe you just 
put your plants on the wrong watering schedules.
Farmers deal with watering problems on a large scale, but changes in water 
quantity, whether too much or too little, can ruin crops on any scale. A 
general rule of thumb for watering is to give a deep watering once a week. 
Sprinkling your plants every day doesn’t have the same beneficial effect as a 
deep soaking that gets down into the root systems.
 
Watering needs depend on a number of factors, including your climate and the 
type of soil you use. Soil types that don’t drain well can fool you into overwa-
tering, which can damage your plants. Sandy soils, on the other hand, may dry 
out quickly, so you may have to water more than once a week.
 
Water responsibly. If you water at the wrong time of day, much of the water is 
wasted to evaporation. The best time to water is either early in the morning 
or around dusk. If you water too much, run-off can steal nutrients and excess 
moisture can damage your plants by promoting fungi growth. And if you water 
too often, you may promote disease that encourages the use of more herbi-
cides, which in turn can damage the soil.

220
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Controlling pests
Anyone who has tended a garden knows that insects can cause your rose-
ate dreams of a bountiful harvest to crash down in ruins. What about those 
pesky weeds that seem to be growing taller than your tomato plant? The 
quick thing to do is grab pesticides and herbicides to eliminate these pests, 
but there are much better ways to fight them. One reason farmers pay so 
much attention to the soil is to prevent potential hazards before they occur. 
Keeping damaging weeds, insects, and organisms to a minimum comes from 
solid watering habits, proper fertilization, and mechanical options, such as 
crop covers that keep the weeds in the dark and the pests away. The main 
thing to remember is to try to leave the chemicals on the shelves.
 
Plenty of earth-friendly solutions exist for controlling weeds and pests. You’ll 
have to consider using pesticides unless you’re one lucky gardener, but think 
green and choose environmentally friendly options.
Whipping weeds
Weeds are more than unsightly plants that give your garden an unkempt 
appearance. An overgrowth of weeds causes problems for your garden by 
competing with your garden plants for water, nutrients, and (if the weeds are 
large enough) sunlight.
The most eco-friendly way to control weeds is to pull them out of the ground 
as they grow. You don’t need any chemicals, but it can take a lot of time (and 
hard work) if you have a large garden. An easier way to control weeds is with 
herbicides. Many chemical herbicides either prevent seeds from sprouting or 
kill growing plants by contact. These chemical herbicides are very effective, 
but you need to know exactly how to use them so you don’t destroy your 
garden plants. Plus, they’re poisonous, so you’ll probably want to use some-
thing safer.
You can prevent weed growth by using mulch (material such as shredded 
bark, grass clippings, straw, and shredded leaves that you can spread over 
the top of your garden). You simply spread mulch around your garden plants 
once they’re up and growing. The mulch prevents weeds from growing by 
blocking sunlight.
 
Don’t spread mulch over your garden seeds right after you plant them. You’ll 
smother your seeds and your garden plants won’t grow. Wait until all your 
plants are growing before you mulch them.
 
Using mulch on your soil may help to keep in moisture, so you may have to 
water less frequently, depending on the location of your garden.

221
 Chapter 14: Growing Your Own Superfoods
Another option is to use a weed-barrier cloth between your rows of garden 
plants. The cloth blocks weeds from growing but allows water into the soil. 
Many people cover the weed-barrier cloth with attractive mulch.
Beating bugs
Gardens attract a lot of bugs. Many of them are beneficial, especially for fruits 
that need to be pollinated. However, some pests, such as cabbage worms, 
aphids, and borers, damage crops. You can spray chemical insecticides on 
bugs, but these pesticides are poisonous.
To avoid the poisons of chemical pesticides, you can choose one of the fol-
lowing available insecticides that are safe for your organic garden:
 
✓ Rotenone is made from the roots of legumes and deprives insects of 
oxygen.
 
✓ Horticultural oil is refined petroleum oil that is mixed with water and 
sprayed onto the insects. The oil causes the insects to suffocate. The oil 
evaporates and doesn’t leave any toxic residue.
 
✓ Insecticidal soap can be sprayed on insects to kill them. Insecticidal 
soap is the safest type of natural insecticide.
 
✓ Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) contains bacteria that can be dusted on 
plants. The bacteria kill insects but are non-toxic to humans and animals.
You can buy an inexpensive sprayer at any garden or home improvement 
store to spray these insecticides on your garden.
Blocking bunnies and other four-legged critters
Many four-legged creatures, especially rabbits and deer, may want to dine on 
your delicious garden plants. Skunks and raccoons may be attracted to grubs 
in the soil and will think nothing of ripping up your garden to get to them. 
Even your cat and dog may take pleasure in a good dig in your garden. Thus, 
you may need to use barriers to protect your garden.
If small animals are a problem, you can build a small fence around your 
garden using posts and wire fencing that will block most animals. If deer are 
a problem, you may need a larger fence. Go to your home improvement store 
for help in choosing the right fencing materials (or maybe hire someone to 
install a fence for you).
If building a fence isn’t a good option, try spraying a mixture of water and hot 
sauce, such as Tabasco sauce, on your plants. A mixture of 2 tablespoons of 
Tabasco sauce to 1 gallon of water should make your plants less attractive to 
animals. Of course, you’ll have to reapply the mixture after rains.

222
Part III: Launching Your Superfoods Lifestyle 
Using superfood-friendly fertilizers
Fertilizers are intended to supplement your soil; they really aren’t the main 
source of nutrition for your garden. But they do help boost the natural nutri-
ent content of your soil. To grow healthy crops, soil must contain three main 
nutrients:
 
✓ Nitrogen: Considered the most important of the three main nutrients, 
nitrogen plays a role in chlorophyll development and photosynthesis, 
making it at least partly responsible for the bright colors in superfood 
fruits and vegetables.
 
✓ Phosphorous: This nutrient is the major contributor to root systems and 
other structural strength. Phosphorous tends to be a bit more stable in 
the soil when compared to nitrogen. When plants are not growing as big 
or they drop their produce too fast, a phosphorous deficiency may be 
the culprit.
 
✓ Potassium: As with phosphorous, potassium works to make crops 
strong, but it also helps with flavor. Potassium doesn’t deplete as fast as 
nitrogen, so it doesn’t have to be added as frequently. In fact, some soils 
maintain good potassium levels without any additives.
Fertilizers generally supplement the soil’s supply of these three main nutrients, 
and some toss in other nutrients, such as iron, copper, zinc, and manganese.
There are two types of fertilizers, inorganic and organic.
 
✓ Inorganic: Inorganic fertilizers use chemicals to provide the nutrient 
boost soil needs. A standard mix is called 10-10-10, which indicates an 
equal mix of each of the three main nutrients.
 
✓ Organic: Organic fertilizer is made from dead plant material and animal 
components. It doesn’t contain any chemicals, which makes it much 
more earth-friendly. You can make your own organic fertilizer by start-
ing a compost pile where organic matter, such as yard waste, fruits, 
vegetables, lawn clippings, and manure, is allowed to decompose. This 
process takes about eight to ten weeks. Organic matter helps add all the 
beneficial organisms that the soil needs to create nutrients and protect 
it from harmful organisms. Animal manure has been a farmer’s favorite 
for creating great soil environments.
 
It’s important to use the recommended amount of fertilizer. Use too much, 
and the excess can drain off into water supplies or pool in your garden and 
damage your crops. Even organic matter such as manure can harm your crops 
if it isn’t aged properly before you apply it; fresh manure can contain too 
much nitrogen, which can damage crops just as inorganic fertilizers can.

223
 Chapter 14: Growing Your Own Superfoods
 
Farmers regularly use crop rotation to help keep soil fresh and revitalized, and 
it’s a technique you can use, too. Say your garden has ten rows — two rows of 
spinach, two rows of carrots, two rows of beets, two rows of tomatoes, and 
two rows of strawberries. Next year, you may want to plant the tomatoes 
where this year’s carrots were and the strawberries where you had the spin-
ach this year. Crop rotation can help the soil recover from nutrient depletion, 
and it can prevent pests from building permanent homes near their favorite 
plants.
Harvesting Your Superfoods
You grew your crops, cultivated your herbs, and pruned your fruit trees to 
branches full of fruit, but when is the absolute best time to actually harvest 
the goods? You don’t want to pick, pull, or cut produce too early because 
you might disrupt the nutrients that you’re looking to get out of these super-
foods. You also may sacrifice texture and flavor by harvesting at the wrong 
time: Think about how the texture and taste of a banana differs when the peel 
is green from when it’s mottled.
Once disconnected from the nutrient system that feeds it (the stem), fruits 
and vegetables go through a different type of processing that ultimately 
determines how long you can wait before you eat them. The chart in Table 
14-1 provides tips on optimal harvesting time for various superfoods.
Once the color and size seem to be adequate, you should plan to harvest in 
the morning when it’s cool. Make sure you don’t leave the produce in direct 
sunlight or heat for too long; transfer it to a cool place for storage and contin-
ued maturing.
 
By picking only the produce that’s ready, you may get several harvests out 
of a single plant. But if you pick too much of the produce early, the plant may 
stop producing and you’ll have to start again.
Rely on your senses and take a taste of the harvest to see whether it tastes 
ready. As you gain more experience gardening, you’ll discover how your 
superfood crops change with age. Then, you can harvest based on your 
desired taste and texture. You may want to pick some for eating and let some 
of your crop mature more for cooking (or vice versa). So use the guidelines 
shown in Table 14-1, but let your taste buds be the leader in your harvesting 
schedule.
 
The timing of harvesting can also affect next year’s crops. If you let some veg-
etables fully mature, it may reduce the production of next year’s crops.

Table 14-1 
Harvesting Common Superfoods
Produce
Harvesting Tips
Other Information
Beets
Harvest when they reach 1–2 
inches in diameter or when the 
tops of the beets are popping 
out of the soil.
You can also use the tops 
of the beets as a green for 
cooking.
Broccoli
Cut the broccoli buds when 
they’re grouped together, and 
make sure to leave about 5 
inches of stalk. Pick them before 
they turn yellow or flower.
Harvest once the individual 
bulbs in the buds are about 
the size of a match head.
Carrots
Harvest when the carrots 
appear to be at least 3/4 inch in 
diameter and bright orange, 
about 60 days after planting.
If you harvest early, you 
should taste the carrots to 
see whether you like the 
slightly different texture 
and flavor.
Cauliflower
Pick when the buds look full, 
compact, and smooth.
Don’t wait too long to har-
vest; the head will start to 
come apart.
Garlic
Pick bulbs when the tops start 
to turn brown/yellow. Make 
sure you dig them out; don’t pull 
on the tops, as this can damage 
the bulb.
After picking, dry the bulbs 
on a screen. Once they’ve 
dried, cut the roots back to 
the edge of the bulb, and 
they’re ready to use.
Kale
Harvest the outer leaves once 
the plant has 6–8 leaves.
Once they bloom, pull the 
pods and throw them away.
Lima Beans
Pods should be full and bright 
green. Harvest before the beans 
turn yellow.
The ends of the bean 
should feel spongy.
Spinach
Harvest from the outside in, 
once the plant is fully green. 
Take the outer 3–4 leaves. 
Spinach needs a cooler climate. 
If you live in a hot climate, 
you may want to grow chard 
instead.
If you take only a few outer 
leaves at a time, the plant 
will continue to grow and 
produce. Pick the outer 
leaves but try to leave 3–4 
along the center.
Strawberries
Strawberries usually are ready 
to pick about 30 days after the 
plant blossoms.
Strawberries don’t ripen 
after they’re picked, so be 
sure to wait until they’re 
fully red.
Tomatoes
Harvest when most of the 
tomato is full color. Let the 
tomato ripen on the plant as 
much as possible.
Focus on color rather than 
size in deciding when to 
harvest. Do not refrigerate 
after harvesting.

T
he nutritional value of any food can be affected by the 
way you prepare it, and superfoods are no exception. 
In this part, we describe the best cooking and storage 
methods for various superfoods to make sure they’re as 
healthful as they can be.
Then we offer our favorite superfood recipes for every 
meal, as well as appetizers, snacks, and desserts. Some of 
these recipes could be called super-duper, because they 
include several superfood ingredients.

In This Chapter
▶ Knowing whether foods are better raw or cooked
▶ Super-cooking your superfoods
▶ Storing and preserving your superfoods
S
uperfoods are super because they contain lots of nutrients, healthy fats, 
phytochemicals, and/or fiber. You want to make sure you keep your 
superfoods healthful by choosing the best cooking methods (or sometimes, 
not cooking them at all). Once any food has been harvested, it begins to lose 
some of its nutritional value — especially fruits and vegetables. You can’t 
do much about this natural loss of vitamins (other than growing your own 
garden — see Chapter 14), but you can choose preparation and cooking 
methods that help to preserve the nutrients that are left.
You may want to stock your freezer and shelves with superfoods you’ve 
grown in your own garden or purchased in bulk when the price has been 
right, or you may want to save leftovers for lunch the next day. It’s important 
to follow the rules of food safety for the proper storage of superfoods.
So remember to keep your foods super by cooking them right and storing 
them properly. You’ll save money because you won’t waste food, and you’ll 
enjoy all your superfoods year-round. In this chapter, we talk about how to 
prepare your superfoods, how to cook them, and how to save them for later.

228
Part IV: Putting Superfoods on Your Table 
To Cook or Not to Cook
Should you eat your superfoods raw or cooked? Raw fruits and vegetables 
are good because the nutrients aren’t lost in cooking. But eating most raw 
fish, for example, just isn’t a good idea (unless you’re a real sushi aficionado).
Fruits and vegetables offer the most nutrients just after they’re harvested. 
As soon as they’re picked, some of the vitamins that are sensitive to heat or 
light begin to degrade. When you expose these foods to the heat of cooking, 
you reduce some of the nutrient content even more.
Sometimes, preparation is just a personal preference. One person may love 
crunchy carrots, while another may prefer a purée. Or maybe you love spin-
ach leaves in a salad, but not cooked. In these cases, our superfoods are per-
fectly healthy either way.
Sometimes it’s a toss-up for the nutritional benefit, too. The anthocyanins in 
the blue pigment in blueberries and the lycopene in the red pigment of toma-
toes are more concentrated by cooking, but the amounts of vitamins C and B 
in both foods are decreased by cooking.
Dealing with superfoods that 
can’t take the heat
While most of our superfoods can be eaten either raw or cooked, some of them 
are best eaten (or stored) in their fresh, raw form as the following list explains.
 
✓ Oranges and strawberries: Cooking oranges and strawberries doesn’t 
make them unhealthy. However, it decreases the amount of vitamin C, 
folate, and other B vitamins dramatically. These two superfood fruits 
should be eaten raw to maintain their nutrient content. Also, keep straw-
berries whole and leave the peel on the oranges until you’re ready to eat 
them. Once you cut into your fruits, the vitamin C starts to diminish.
 
✓ Nuts and seeds: Raw nuts and seeds may be better than roasted nuts 
and seeds. They last much longer, and you don’t have to watch for any 
excess salt or unhealthy flavorings that are often added during roasting. 
While roasted nuts and seeds contain the same nutritional content as 
their raw counterparts, they become rancid more quickly, so don’t roast 
them until you’re ready to eat them, or buy the amount of roasted nuts 
and seeds that you can eat in a few days and store them in an airtight 
container in the refrigerator.

229
 Chapter 15: Preparing and Preserving without Sacrificing Nutrition
 
✓ Flax seeds and flaxseed oil: The oils in flax are delicate, and cooking 
and heat exposure destroy flax’s health properties. The fats will go bad 
if the flax isn’t stored properly. Buy unmilled flax seeds in small bags 
and keep them refrigerated. When you’re ready to use the seeds, grind a 
spoonful in a coffee grinder. Add flaxseed oil to foods that have already 
been cooked, and always store bottled flaxseed oil in the refrigerator.
 
✓ Wheat grass: Wheat grass is usually consumed in powdered form or as a 
juice. In either case, wheat grass is processed without high heat because 
heat destroys the enzymes that are believed to be beneficial to health.
The fact that some foods are best raw doesn’t mean proper storage isn’t a 
concern. Apples, bananas, and oranges keep at room temperature for a few 
days, but should be refrigerated for longer storage. Raw vegetables, super-
food oils such as olive oil and flaxseed oil, and raw nuts should be refriger-
ated in covered containers.
 
Olive oil starts to spoil as soon as you open the container. It’s okay to keep 
small amounts of oil in a cool dark space away from your oven or other 
sources of heat, but if you buy large containers of oil, keep most of it refriger-
ated until you need it.
 
It’s important to keep your raw superfoods safe from cross-contamination of 
bacteria that may be found in raw meats or unwashed food:
 
✓ Use separate utensils for cutting raw meats. Say you’re serving a salad 
with raw tomatoes, carrots, and spinach leaves, along with baked 
chicken for dinner. If you use a knife and a cutting board to cut raw 
chicken, don’t use that same knife and cutting board for preparing your 
raw salad vegetables.
 
✓ Wash your hands thoroughly. Wash your hands before you prepare a 
meal and after you handle any raw meats or unwashed produce. This 
helps to stop the spread of bacteria.
 
✓ Rinse fruits and vegetables before preparing them. Even if you throw 
away the peels, you should rinse your produce first to remove any bacteria 
from the surface. Rinse pre-packaged greens such as spinach leaves, too.
 
✓ Store raw produce away from raw meats. Keep raw meats in plastic bags 
to prevent leakage of fluids, and, when you store them in the fridge, don’t 
put them above any foods that you’ll eat raw, such as fruits and veggies.

230
Part IV: Putting Superfoods on Your Table 
Cooking when cooking is best
Some superfoods need to be cooked (or processed in some manner) before 
you eat them, as the following list explains. Don’t worry: Cooking doesn’t 
harm the nutritional value of these foods.
 
✓ Dry beans and soybeans: Dry beans such as black beans and soybeans 
must be cooked before you eat them. Raw dry beans will cause stom-
achaches because they contain phytohaemagglutinin (a type of protein 
known as a lectin that causes red blood cells to bind together) and are 
difficult to digest.
 
✓ Lentils: Like the dry beans, lentils need to be cooked before you eat 
them. Alternatively, lentils can be sprouted and you can eat the raw 
sprouts, as the nearby sidebar explains.
 
✓ Fish: Our superfood fish should be cooked, too, unless you’re very 
skilled at preparing raw fish dishes such as sushi and sashimi, and you 
can find the best sources for purchasing healthful raw fish. Cooking fish 
doesn’t ruin protein, nutrients, or omega-3 fatty acids. We have several 
recipes for salmon dishes (see Chapter 17), and pre-cooked salmon and 
tuna are available in convenient cans and pouches that can be used for 
delicious superfood sandwiches and salads. Fish doesn’t need to be 
overcooked, and fish like tuna and salmon can be served medium-rare. 
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), fish 
should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit.
Using the Healthiest Cooking Methods
Cooking changes the foods we eat. Think of an egg: a fried or hard-boiled 
egg bears little physical resemblance to a raw one. Likewise, the color and 
Sprouting lentils
Lentils can be sprouted just like alfalfa seeds 
or beans, and you can eat the raw sprouts in 
a salad or stir-fry. Sprouting lentils at home is 
a fun project and very easy to do by following 
these steps:
 1. Place 1/2 cup lentils in a glass jar with 2 cups 
water. Cover the jar with cheesecloth, secure 
with a rubber band, and let sit overnight.
 2. The next morning, drain the water, rinse the 
lentils, and cover with fresh water. Repeat 
this process for two days.
 3. On the third or fourth day, you’ll see 1/4- to 
1/2-inch sprouts peeking out of the lentils. 
When you see the sprouts, they’re ready to 
go. Drain the sprouted lentils and refriger-
ate them in a jar or plastic bag.

231
 Chapter 15: Preparing and Preserving without Sacrificing Nutrition
texture of meat changes when you cook it. And even the toughest vegetables 
and grains become soft and tender with cooking.
We cook the foods we eat for a variety of reasons:
 
✓ To change the temperature. Some foods are more appealing when 
they’re served hot (not many people can enjoy a bowl of cold chicken 
noodle soup, for example). Other foods are good either hot or cold, like 
green tea: Served hot, it’s a cup of steaming comfort on a damp, gray 
day. Served cold, it’s a refreshing break on a sunny, warm afternoon.
 
✓ To change the flavor. Cooking changes the flavor of many foods, 
and not only because of the heat. Seasoning a food you cook with lus-
cious herbs and spices can transform a dull vegetable into something 
delicious.
 
✓ To change the texture. Cooking makes vegetables soft, so someone who 
doesn’t like crunchy carrots might just love a cooked carrot purée. The 
flesh of fish becomes flaky when it’s ready to eat, rather than rubbery. 
Legumes and grains start out as hard seeds and become soft and tender 
morsels when they’re cooked.
 
✓ To kill bacteria. The foods in your kitchen have probably been in quite 
a few different places and may have been exposed to bacteria and molds 
that can make you sick. This is especially true for meat, poultry, and fish 
that may be contaminated with bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli. 
Exposure to high temperatures wipes these little bugs right out.
Cooking foods also changes the nutritional content. Some nutrients like 
vitamin A, lycopene, and some other phytochemicals become more concen-
trated, but vitamin C and the B vitamins are usually greatly reduced with 
cooking. Of course, the cooking methods you choose make a difference in the 
amount of nutrients lost. Generally, methods that use shorter exposure to 
heat result in less nutritional loss.
 
Boiling is a poor cooking method for vegetables because the heat and cooking 
time cause nutrients to be destroyed or leached into the cooking water. If you 
do boil your vegetables, use the cooking water whenever possible in soup, stew, 
or sauces. Deep-frying and pan-frying are even worse because they introduce 
extra unhealthy fats and calories. Some methods, like grilling and slow-cooking, 
can be good or bad, so we give you some tips on how to do them right.
Steaming
Steaming vegetables retains more of the nutrients that would normally get 
washed away in boiling water. Steaming also allows for a wonderful crisp-
tender texture compared to boiled vegetables that often get mushy.

232
Part IV: Putting Superfoods on Your Table 
Steaming is easy. Even if you don’t have a fancy countertop steamer, you can 
steam your vegetables in a pot on the stove using an expandable vegetable 
steamer:
 
1. Add 1 inch of water to a cooking pot and place on high heat. Place an 
expandable vegetable steamer into the pot.
 
 The bottom of the steamer will be just above water level.
 
2. When the water is boiling, place your vegetables into the steamer and 
steam them until they’re crisp-tender.
 
 This takes about three to five minutes, depending on the size of the 
pieces.
 
3. Serve your vegetables with a sprinkle of lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
Electric steamers are very convenient. Add water to the steamer (follow 
the manufacturer’s instructions) and place your vegetables in the steamer 
basket. Steam until vegetables are crisp-tender. These electric steamers usu-
ally work very well as rice-cookers, too.
 
Expandable vegetable steamers are inexpensive and easy to find in most gro-
cery stores and retail stores that carry home goods. Electric steamers vary in 
cost depending on size and additional features, such as the ability to cook two 
separate vegetables at the same time or program the steamer’s timer. Black 
and Decker makes several styles of electric vegetable steamers for any budget 
or need.
Stir-frying and sautéing
Shorter cooking time makes stir-frying and sautéing better for superfoods 
than other types of frying because most of the nutrient content is preserved. 
Both methods use high heat with just a small amount of oil. To stir fry, you 
use a spoon or spatula to stir the foods as they cook. To sauté, you keep the 
pan moving and use a flipping motion to toss the foods so they don’t burn. 
Use a large nonstick skillet or a wok and oils that can take the heat (peanut, 
olive, and canola oils are good choices), and cook vegetables only until 
they’re crisp-tender. Follow these steps for both cooking methods:
 
1. Prepare your vegetables and ingredients before you start cooking — 
you don’t want to overcook one vegetable while you’re slicing another. 
Wash and cut vegetables into bite-sized pieces.
 
 If you’re adding meat to your stir-fry, be sure to cook it thoroughly 
before you cook your vegetables. Don’t put raw meat on your cooked 
vegetables.
 
2. Heat the wok or sauté pan to a high temperature and then add a small 
amount of oil.

233
 Chapter 15: Preparing and Preserving without Sacrificing Nutrition
 
3. For a simple stir-fry, add garlic or onion and stir for one minute.
 
4. Add other vegetables and cook them (stirring constantly) until they’re 
crisp-tender.
 
5. Add any sauces, such as soy sauce, ginger sauce, or teriyaki sauce, 
about halfway through the cooking time.
 
 When you sauté foods, control the temperature. Otherwise the oil may 
get too hot and start to smoke.
 
A sauté pan has a wide, flat bottom and should be made from high-quality, 
heavy-gauge metal, such as stainless steel, with a copper core or aluminum 
bottom. This type of pan conducts heat evenly for the best cooking. Calphalon 
and All-Clad make high-quality and affordable sauté pans.
Traditional woks are made with thin carbon steel, but they must be sea-
soned, so many people prefer stainless steel woks. Joyce Chen makes carbon 
steel and nonstick woks that are terrific for stir-frying at home.
Poaching
Poaching is cooking a food in a liquid. One well-known example is a poached 
egg, which is cooked in water. You can simmer your foods in wine, vinegar, 
or low-sodium broth to add flavor. Add even more flavor by sprinkling some 
herbs and spices into the poaching liquid.
 
Poaching isn’t the same as boiling. You use low heat so that your liquid just 
simmers (you’ll see a few small bubbles rise to the surface of the liquid).
Poaching is typically used to cook meats, poultry, and fish (it’s perfect for 
salmon), but you can also poach vegetables and fruits. Following are a couple 
ideas:
 
✓ Poach salmon fillets in a broth of equal parts white wine and low-sodium 
chicken broth, with some lemon juice and a dash of salt and pepper. 
Simmer the fillets for about 10 minutes or until the flesh is flaky. Serve 
with some slices of lemon and roasted vegetables on the side.
 
✓ Poach apples for a healthful sweet treat. Wash and cut two Granny 
Smith apples into halves and poach in apple cider with a cinnamon stick 
and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Simmer apples until they’re tender, about 10 
to 15 minutes. Serve with a sauce of 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and 1 table-
spoon of honey, and sprinkle with chopped almonds.
Choose a saucepan that is just a bit bigger than the food you’re poaching, 
and use enough liquid to just cover your food. The pan should be made of a 
heavy-gauge stainless steel with a copper core or aluminum bottom. Copper 
and aluminum conduct heat well, but you don’t want these two metals to 

234
Part IV: Putting Superfoods on Your Table 
come in direct contact with your food because they can interact negatively 
with foods; stainless steel does not. All-Clad and Calphalon produce high-
quality saucepans at a good price.
Roasting and baking
Traditionally, roasting was done over open flames and baking was done in an 
oven, but today the two terms are almost interchangeable. You can roast or 
bake meats and vegetables in your oven, but you bake desserts, breads, and 
pastries.
Roasting and baking reduce vitamin content, but they’re still considered 
healthful cooking methods because neither requires additional fat (although 
adding a little olive oil to roast vegetables adds a nice flavor).
 
Roasting brings out the natural flavors in vegetables, especially the sweetness, 
so it may be a great way to please picky eaters who don’t like the bitter taste 
of vegetables.
To roast vegetables:
 
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and place one layer 
of washed and sliced vegetables on a roasting pan or foil-lined 
baking dish.
 
 For best results, cut the vegetables into pieces that are about the 
same size.
 
2. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil over your vegetables (you don’t 
need much).
 
 You can also use an olive oil spray.
 
3. Add your favorite seasonings, such as rosemary, oregano, nutmeg, 
and salt and pepper.
 
4. Roast until the vegetables are tender (pierce them with a fork) and 
slightly browned — about 20 to 35 minutes.
 
Serve roasted superfood carrots and beets (see Chapter 5) topped with 
toasted nuts for a delicious side dish. You can also bake fish fillets (see our 
salmon recipes in Chapter 17) or whole fish in your oven. You can roast your 
own pumpkin seeds; however, you should do so at a much lower temperature: 
about 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
Choose high-quality roasting and baking pans for best results. Look for heavy 
aluminized steel, which is important for even cooking. A nonstick surface 
is also necessary. Some roasting pans come with a metal rack so meat and 
poultry can cook without wallowing in grease. Chicago Metallic makes high-
quality, affordable lines of cookware.

Slow-cooking
Preparing dinner with a slow cooker, or crockpot, is easy. Simply add your 
ingredients to the cooker before you go to work, and when you get home, din-
ner’s hot and ready. Slow cookers cook foods at lower temperatures but for 
very long periods of time. You lose some of the vitamins, but if you need the 
convenience, using a slow cooker can still be very healthful.
 
Make a simple vegetable soup by using low-sodium chicken broth and your 
choice of vegetables. You can also cook dry beans in a slow cooker with 
water, onions, garlic, salt, and pepper.
To get the healthiest meals from your slow cooker, follow these guidelines:
 
✓ Choose recipes that are low in saturated fats (avoid using high-fat red 
meats) and low in sodium, and use the liquid as part of the final dish 
(think pasta sauce, soup, or stew), because some of the vitamins that 
are cooked out of the foods will be found in the broth.
 
✓ Keep perishable ingredients refrigerated until you’re ready to start the 
slow cooker.
 
✓ To make sure your food reaches the right temperature, fill the slow 
cooker at least half full, but not more than 2/3 full.
Grilling
You probably think of grilling as a way to cook hamburgers, steaks, and hot-
dogs on a warm summer day. But you can also grill many superfoods, such 
as fish, vegetables, and even some fruits. You’ll keep your kitchen cooler and 
enjoy healthful foods with a grilled flavor.
You can buy a charcoal grill, which is preferred by many cooks for the char-
coal flavoring, or you can buy a gas grill, which is more convenient. Either 
grill works just fine.
How microwaves work
Microwave ovens cook food when the radio 
waves emitted in the oven are absorbed by the 
water, fat, and sugar in the foods. The micro-
waves are converted to heat, which cooks the 
food. Plastic, glass, and ceramic materials don’t 
absorb microwaves, so they stay cool (until 
the heat from the food warms them up). The air 
surrounding the food isn’t warm at all (unlike 
the inside of a conventional oven), so foods 
don’t brown or get crusty when you cook them 
unless you use special foils that can brown the 
edges of breads and pastries by exposing the 
surfaces of these foods to extra heat.

236
Part IV: Putting Superfoods on Your Table 
 
Cut vegetables in long slices so they won’t fall through the grates of the grill. 
Brush them with olive oil or marinate them in a seasoned dressing. Place the 
vegetables on the grill and cook until tender. Add some salt and pepper, and 
they’re ready to serve.
Follow these steps to cook fish on the grill:
 
1. Lay two sheets of aluminum foil flat (or use heavy-duty aluminum foil 
to prevent accidental tearing of the foil).
 
2. Place one fish fillet in the center of the foil and fold up all four sides 
slightly; add a splash of white wine, olive oil, lemon juice, and a clove 
of garlic.
 
3. Fold the foil over the fish and crimp the sides together to seal the pouch.
 
4. Place the pouch on a grill over medium heat and cook until fish is 
tender and flaky, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Grills come in a broad range of sizes and prices, from small portable tabletop 
grills to very large grills. Weber makes high-quality grills, both charcoal and 
gas varieties.
Microwaving safely
Almost every kitchen has a microwave oven, and they’re wonderfully fast and 
convenient. Microwave radiation may sound scary, but that part of micro-
waving is very safe. The problem with using a microwave oven is that it may 
cook unevenly, which can leave cold spots in foods that don’t reach a high 
enough temperature for thorough cooking.
 
Your microwave works best for heating foods that have already been cooked 
or only need to be warmed. However, you can buy accessories that allow you 
to cook some foods nicely, such as microwave steamers and turntables that 
allow for more even cooking.
Follow these tips to use your microwave safely:
 
✓ Arrange foods to be heated evenly in your microwave-safe container. 
Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a lid to trap heat from the foods (and 
protect your microwave oven from the inevitable splatters).
 
✓ Use containers that have been approved for microwave use. Some soft 
plastics give off toxic substances when they’re exposed to hot foods. 
Glass and ceramic are safe and stand up to the heat of microwaved 
foods better than thin plastic containers. Don’t cook (or reheat) foods in 
Styrofoam containers.
 
✓ Stir soft foods and liquids frequently while cooking to avoid hot and cold 
spots.

237
 Chapter 15: Preparing and Preserving without Sacrificing Nutrition
 
✓ If you use a microwave to thaw foods, follow the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions that accompany your microwave and cook the thawed foods right 
away. Be especially careful with thawed meats, poultry, and fish. They’re 
still raw, and improper handling can result in cross-contamination of 
other foods.
 
 Some frozen vegetables are packaged in special steamer bags made 
from microwave-safe plastics. These are quite convenient, but be careful 
when you open the bags because the vegetables inside will be very hot.
Storing for Later Use
It would be wonderful to start every meal with fresh, in-season superfoods, 
but that isn’t practical. Some of your superfoods will need to be kept in stor-
age for a while. Or, if you make a big meal, you may have some leftovers to 
keep for lunch the next day.
Some people like to prepare a week’s worth (or more) of meals at one time 
to keep in the refrigerator or freezer until needed. Then these meals can be 
popped into the oven or microwave for easy cooking at the end of a busy day.
To keep your superfoods healthful, you need to follow a few simple rules to 
keep them safe and delicious. This is important for storage of leftovers, for 
long-term freezing of foods, and for canning and preserving.
Keeping cold foods cold and hot foods hot
Keep your foods at the proper temperature to reduce the risk of spoilage 
and bacterial contamination. Your refrigerator should be kept at 40 degrees 
Fahrenheit or lower, and your freezer should be kept at 0 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Hot foods need to be kept at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or higher to prevent 
bacterial growth. Perishable foods should only remain at room temperature 
for two hours (or only one hour if the air temperature is about 90 degrees or 
higher). Leaving food out in the open air longer than that may lead to spoil-
age and food-borne illness.
To ensure food safety, heed the following tips:
 
✓ When you buy your groceries, choose the cold and frozen foods last and 
drive straight home after shopping. Don’t leave your food in a hot car.
 
✓ Remove leftovers promptly after a meal and keep them in resealable 
containers in your refrigerator. Use them within three or four days.
 
✓ Keep picnic foods cold in coolers with ice. Keep raw meats in a separate 
cooler to prevent cross-contamination with other foods.

238
Part IV: Putting Superfoods on Your Table 
 
✓ Keep hot picnic and party foods (like a buffet) at 140 degrees or warmer.
 
✓ Transport cold foods in portable coolers and hot foods in insulated 
containers.
 
✓ Pack lunches in insulated bags with frozen cold-packs to keep beverages 
and perishable foods cold and sandwiches safe. Keep soups, hot foods, and 
warm beverages in insulated containers, like the ones made by Thermos.
Freezing superfoods for later
You can keep most foods in the freezer for several months. However, improp-
erly frozen foods will show signs of freezer burn, which appears as white, 
dried-out patches on your food. You can freeze raw and cooked foods as long 
as they’re in separate containers.
 
✓ Wrap your superfoods fish (and low-fat meat and poultry) in heavy-
duty freezer paper. The plastic wrap used at the meat counter in stores 
can’t withstand freezing for long periods, and your food will be ruined.
 
✓ Retain the color and texture of vegetables by blanching them before 
freezing. Simply place small amounts of the vegetables (about the 
amount you want to store in a freezer container) in boiling water for a 
short time (usually 3 to 5 minutes) to partially cook the vegetable. You 
can test doneness by biting into a piece — it should still be crunchy. 
Plunge the vegetables into a bowl of ice water as soon as you remove 
them from the boiling water to stop the cooking process and bring the 
temperature down. When the vegetables are cold, place them in freezer 
containers and freeze.
 
✓ Use freezer bags, some of which are even microwave-safe and spe-
cially treated to prevent freezer burn. Remove as much air as possible 
from each bag before zipping it shut.
 
 If you freeze a lot of food, you may want to buy a vacuum sealing machine 
and rolls of freezer bag material. These machines remove all of the air, 
which means you can store the foods longer with less chance of freezer 
burn.
 
✓ Thaw your foods in the microwave or in a large pot of cold water in 
the refrigerator. Don’t set them out at room temperature because this 
can invite bacterial growth.
 
✓ Most superfood fruits can be frozen without any special preparation 
(see Chapter 5). However, you may want to use sturdy containers to 
prevent the fruit from getting crushed in the freezer.
 
Try once-a-week (or once-a-month) cooking if you have a big freezer. Spend a 
day preparing meals with your fresh ingredients and freeze them to be cooked 
and served during the subsequent days or weeks. For example, you can place 
four raw, skinless chicken breasts in a large freezer bag with 1/2 cup olive oil, 

239
 Chapter 15: Preparing and Preserving without Sacrificing Nutrition
your favorite dry herbs, and salt and pepper, and pop it in the freezer. When 
you want to eat them, thaw them in the refrigerator or microwave and bake in 
an oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit until cooked through. Heat a bag 
of superfood vegetables for a side dish, and add a salad made with pre-washed 
greens and fresh vegetables.
You can also cook your meals in large amounts and freeze extra portions that 
you simply heat and eat later (think vegetarian lasagna).
Canning and preserving
People have canned and preserved foods for home use for quite some time. 
While freezing is probably the easiest method for long-term storage of foods, 
there’s something nice about a cabinet full of home-canned vegetables, fruits, 
sauces, and pickled foods. When you can foods, you heat them to a tempera-
ture that will kill bacteria and allow the jars to seal.
Canning your superfoods
There are two types of canning methods: a water bath and pressure canning. 
The water bath method uses hot water to heat jars that have been filled 
with foods. This works fine for fruits, pickles, and tomatoes, but not for other 
vegetables.
 
All other vegetables need to be canned with a pressure canner. Vegetables are 
low in acid, so they’re likely to become contaminated with botulism (a food-
borne illness caused by a toxin that can withstand high temperatures).
To properly can foods, start with scrupulously clean jars to ensure your 
foods don’t get contaminated with bacteria or other substances. Also make 
sure the jars don’t have any cracks or chips, especially on the rims, as that 
may prevent the lids from sealing. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Prepare the vegetables you want to can by cleaning them, cutting them 
into pieces, placing them in a large pot, and covering them with water.
 
2. Boil the vegetables for five minutes.
 
3. Add vegetables and boiling water to your jars, leaving about 1 inch of 
headspace. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to each jar.
 
4. Place the canning lids on the jars and secure with the rings.
 
 Follow the instructions that come with your pressure canner for 
processing.
 
 Be sure that all canning jars seal properly. Any unsealed jars need to be 
kept in the refrigerator or reprocessed.

240
Part IV: Putting Superfoods on Your Table 
 
Beets can be pickled or canned with vinegar, similar to pickling cucumbers or 
peppers.
Water canners are simply large pots with wire racks. They’re inexpensive and 
easy to find in stores. Presto makes pressure canners that you can use for 
your low-acid vegetables.
Dehydrating your superfoods
You may want to try drying some of your superfoods (like apples, bananas, 
and strawberries) in a dehydrator. Prepare your fruits and layer them on the 
drying racks; then place the racks in the dehydrator. Your fruits are dehy-
drated and preserved when they appear shriveled with a leathery texture.
 
Use dried fruits in breakfast cereals, or make your own granola (see Chapter 
16). Make fruit leathers by puréeing fruit and spreading it on special fruit 
leather paper.
Dehydrators vary by capacity and amount of airflow. Look for a dehydrator 
that offers lots of drying space and heats with an even temperature. Excalibur 
makes affordable dehydrators for home use.
Smoking superfood fish
Many people enjoy smoked salmon and smoked trout, and, if you own a 
smoker, you’ll enjoy making your own smoked fish. A smoker is similar to 
a grill, but you cook with smoke that carries the flavor of the wood that’s 
burned in the smoker.
The best part of smoking your own fish is that you control the ingredients 
used in the preparation. Some commercial brands of smoked fish contain 
nitrates, chemicals found in smoked foods, lunchmeats, and sausages that 
have been linked to a higher risk of some cancers.
To smoke your own fish:
 
1. Prepare your salmon or trout by soaking it in a brine (salt water) 
before smoking.
 
2. Choose wood that complements the flavor of your fish.
 
 Alder is often used for salmon. Other woods that work well with fish 
include apple and oak.
 
3. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for using your smoker.
 
Serve your smoked fish as an appetizer with whole-grain crackers, or top a 
healthful pizza with some smoked salmon, sun-dried tomatoes, and basil.
Smokers vary greatly in price, and you can choose from charcoal or electric 
units. Weber makes terrific charcoal smokers at lower prices. Old Smokey 
makes inexpensive electric smokers that perform very well.

and people who eat breakfast every day have an 
easier time watching their weight. This doesn’t 
mean that just any food will do. A couple of glazed 
donuts with a can of high-caffeine soda isn’t a 
good breakfast. Cold cereal from a box is better, 
but still may have too much sugar that you don’t 
need. There are much healthier alternatives, and 
breakfast time is a great time to start with some 
superfoods.
In this chapter, we give you some delicious and

Understanding the Importance of the 
Most Important Meal of the Day
When you eat breakfast, you break the fast your body went through during 
the night. You need breakfast to refuel your body and your brain. A study 
reported in the journal Pediatrics found that high school students who eat 
breakfast are more alert and have better cognitive function. The same goes 
for adults, too. When you eat breakfast, you replenish the glucose (a type of 
sugar) that your brain needs to function, so you feel better and think better.
Unfortunately, many people mistakenly believe that skipping breakfast will 
help them lose weight, but it doesn’t work. According to the Mayo Clinic, 
eating breakfast is actually good for weight loss. People who eat breakfast 
every day are much more likely to be at a healthy weight. When you skip 
breakfast, you end up eating too much when you do finally eat.
 
That doesn’t mean you have to eat the instant you get out of bed. You can wait 
to eat until you feel hungry. Just remember to eat something nutritious.
Not any old breakfast will do. You need to eat a healthful, balanced breakfast to 
start your day. Choose a variety of foods that will give you plenty of nutrients 
and fiber, such as whole grains, low-fat dairy products, protein sources, and 
fruits and vegetables. Here are some examples of simple but healthful breakfasts:
 
✓ A slice of whole-grain toast with almond butter, a fresh piece of fruit, 
and a glass of nonfat milk
 
✓ A small bowl of whole-grain, high-fiber cold cereal with blueberries and 
nonfat milk, and calcium-fortified orange juice
 
✓ One hard-boiled egg, a small whole-grain bagel, and low-fat cream 
cheese with a cup of green tea
 
✓ Hot oatmeal topped with strawberries and walnuts
Making Super Breakfast Recipes
When you add superfoods to your breakfast lineup, you take breakfast to a 
higher level. Breakfast is a super time to get these superfoods into your day:
 
✓ Oats: Enjoy oatmeal, whole-grain bread, muffins, or cereal, or add oats 
to pancake and waffle recipes.
 
✓ Fruits and berries: A piece of fresh fruit, such as an apple, banana, or 
orange, can be added to any breakfast. Sliced fruits and berries can be 
added to cereal or to crepes, pancakes, or waffles.

243
 Chapter 16: Starting the Day Right: Superfood Breakfast Recipes
 
✓ Nuts and seeds: Top oatmeal with walnuts, pecans, or almonds, or sprin-
kle flax or chia seeds on your cereal.
 
✓ Green tea: Replace one cup of coffee with hot green tea.
 
✓ Vegetables: Include spinach, broccoli, or tomatoes in egg dishes.
The following recipes can help you get some of these superfoods in your 
breakfast. We have “breakfast-on-the-go” recipes for foods that you can grab 
just before you head out the door. We also have some easy recipes that take 
a little more time, but not much effort. They’ll be ready about the same time 
your coffee’s done. There are also delicious recipes that are perfect for week-
ends or whenever you have a little extra time.
Eating on the go
These recipes are perfect for anyone who has a habit of skipping breakfast 
because “there just isn’t enough time.” Breakfast doesn’t need to be a full-
sized, sit-down meal, with lots of dirty pots, pans, and dishes to wash.
The secret is to have your breakfast foods ready to go so they don’t need much 
preparation. Make our muffins or granola on the weekends and use them for 
breakfast during the week. Your breakfast-on-the-go items may also include 
hard-boiled eggs, whole-wheat toast with nut butter, and single-serving cups of 
yogurt (but avoid extra sugar).
Some of our superfood breakfast recipes may not be as sweet as the cereal 
and pastry items you may be used to eating. But cutting back on sugar allows 
you to taste the flavors of the fruits, nuts, and grains. If you’re used to a 
sugary breakfast, you can add a little sugar, honey, 100 percent fruit spread 
or artificial sweetener — just not too much.
Ready-to-eat cereals
Grocery stores devote entire aisles to ready-to-
eat cereals that are convenient and tasty, and 
some are quite healthful. Just about all cereals 
are fortified with extra vitamins and minerals. 
The problem is that some are overloaded with 
sugar, especially kids’ cereals. Too much sugar 
means too many calories.
Read the labels. Choose cereals that are low 
in sugar (even the non-frosted cereals can be 
sugary) and high in fiber. Look for the words 
“100 percent whole wheat” or “100 percent 
whole grain” on the label. Shredded wheat, 
toasted oat rings, and puffed wheat bran flakes 
are all excellent choices. Dress them up with 
berries, sliced bananas, raisins, or peaches. 
Still need a little more sweetness? Add just one 
teaspoon of sugar or honey, or a little sucralose 
(known best as Splenda).

Easy breakfast recipes
Maybe you aren’t in a big rush in the morning, but you still don’t want to 
spend time cooking extravagant breakfast foods. Not to worry. These recipes 
are easy to make and taste great.
These recipes feature fresh fruits that are rich in nutrients and fiber, plus 
whole grains whenever possible. Oats are our favorite whole grain, and we 
also include a recipe for hot quinoa, which is perfect to warm up with on a 
cold morning.
 
T Banana Cream Oatmeal
A bowl of hot oatmeal is so good on a cool morning. Oatmeal is already a superfood, but 
we add a banana to make it even more super. This is a little sweeter than our other 
breakfast recipes, so it’s a great choice for kids (or grown-ups) who have grown accus-
tomed to sugary breakfast cereals.
Prep time: About 2 minutes
Cooking time: 4 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 cup rolled oats
13/4 cups water
1 tablespoon brown sugar (or substitute 
artificial sweetener)

Living lavishly on the weekends
Start your weekend mornings with these healthful and delicious breakfast 
recipes that are worth the little extra time they take to prepare. Get a jump-
start on your daily superfoods intake with recipes that will satisfy your sweet 
tooth (with less sugar) plus two savory egg dishes.
The lowdown on natural sweeteners
What is the nutritional difference between regu-
lar sugar and high-fructose corn syrup? Almost 
nothing. What about between regular sugar 
and turbinado (raw sugar)? Just the color. What 
about honey — is that better? Maybe a little, 
but very little. Nutritionally, honey and sugar are 
the same. Some experts claim some honey has 
some health benefits, but research to support 
those claims isn’t clear. What is clear, however, 
is the delicious flavor of honey that you won’t 
find with sugar, which really only tastes sweet. 
But don’t give honey to children under 1 year of 
age, as it can cause botulism in babies.
Americans really like sweet stuff. Sodas, can-
dies, and pastries are obviously high in sugar, 
but sugar is creeping into our diet in lots of 
processed foods. According to the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, consumption of 
sweeteners added to processed foods has 
gone up 23 percent since the 1980s. Increased 
consumption of sugar has resulted in increased 
calorie intakes. Combine that with less physical 
activity, and the result is unwanted weight gain 
that leads to chronic diseases such as heart 
disease, diabetes, and some cancers.
Does this mean you should eliminate all sweet-
eners from your diet? No. A small amount of 
sugar or honey or even high-fructose corn syrup 
every day is okay. You can cut back a lot of the 
sweeteners in your diet just by being aware of 
what you eat. Read labels, opt for whole foods, 
and choose recipes wisely.

Many of these recipes feature superfood fruits and whole grains, especially 
oats. We’ve cut back the sugar and brought out the flavor of the fruits. Our 
egg dishes contain superfood vegetables and nuts. Don’t want to eat eggs? 
Our egg dishes will work with substitutes such as Egg Beaters.
 
T Whole-Wheat and Oat Pancakes

Superfood Main Dish Recipes
In This Chapter
▶ Planning main dishes: Good food and good conversation
▶ Understanding the importance of a healthy family meal
▶ Making superfoods dishes to share
W
hen you and your family are on the go, 
tracking what everyone is eating and 
whether you’re getting the right balance of foods 
during the day can be hard. That’s why it’s impor-
tant to plan and prepare healthy superfoods din-
ners for your family. Family dinners are a great 
opportunity to get everyone to eat healthily and 
gain back some ground from the poor eating 
habits that both children and adults may indulge 
in during the day.
When preparing dinner, you can get superfoods 
in everything from salmon to pizza. After you get 
some creative meal ideas, you’ll see how fun and 
easy it is to make healthy (and delicious) main 
dishes. In this chapter, we offer some easy recipes that cover a variety of 
superfoods — and will surely keep your family coming back for more!
Making the Most of Family Mealtime
Turn off the TV, let the phone go to voice mail, and disconnect from the World 
Wide Web, because it’s time to sit down for an hour devoted to food and com-
panionship. It just happens that dinner is the most consistent time for family 
gathering. Dinnertime is the perfect time to get in touch with your family and 
find out what’s going on in everyone’s day. Getting everyone together for 
dinner may be a challenge, but try to enjoy every chance you get.

Several studies have looked at the importance of family mealtimes, for both 
children and adults. A study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association 
showed that both children and parents strongly value family meals. Columbia 
University researchers found that children who ate more than five meals per 
week with their families had higher grades. Other studies have looked into 
school and work performance, drug use, and language skills, and have found 
similar positive outcomes associated with families who share several meals a 
week. A study published in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine 
claims that eating family meals may reduce the number of teens afflicted with 
eating disorders. Wow — all this from spending some quality family time 
around the table enjoying good food.
Obviously, dinner is a time to feed both your bodies and your relationships. 
People who eat alone tend to eat less and may therefore suffer from 
malnutrition — an important fact to remember if you have friends and 
family members who spend most of their mealtimes alone. Invite them to 
join you when you can.
If you have trouble getting your family to the dinner table without simultane-
ously watching TV or attempting to scarf down the food and scram, you may 
have to get creative to get them into main meal festivities. One way to keep 
the attendance up is to get the family involved in meal planning and prepa-
ration. Young children often love to cook, and they’ll jump at the chance to 
help in the kitchen.
 
Putting together a meal is a great accomplishment, especially when you’re 
new to the kitchen, so be sure to compliment the chef.
Making a Statement with the Main Dish
The recipes for the main dishes in this chapter have a nice mix of superfoods 
that are sure to tantalize your taste buds! These recipes are easy to follow 
and a perfect way to get friends and family involved in the planning, cooking, 
and, most important, eating of healthy meals. You also find easy tricks for 
adding and substituting ingredients to get more nutritious superfoods into 
the recipes.
Too many of us are set on the idea that food that tastes good usually isn’t 
good for you. Dinner is a perfect time to direct everyone’s attention to the fun 
aspects of putting together a healthy meal. Let everyone know that they’re 
eating superfoods. Tell your family how the foods and ingredients contribute 
to good health. With these delicious superfoods meals, both young and old 
can discover that healthy eating can also taste good.

Baked Salmon Fillets
Salmon is one of the fish that are packed with the most omega-3 fatty acids. Even 
people who don’t like fish are likely to enjoy salmon when you prepare it this way.

T Black Soybean Quesadillas
This is a great low-carb meal with both soybeans and garlic. Black soybeans have a 
milder flavor than regular yellow soybeans. These quesadillas are a tasty treat for those 
trying to lose or maintain their weight. The soybeans are a great source of protein, 
healthy fatty acids, and plenty of vitamins and minerals. Garlic adds great flavor and 
has immune and antioxidant benefits.
Prep time: About 20 minutes
Cooking time: 10 to 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
4 low-carb or whole-grain tortillas
3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded reduced-fat Monterey 
Jack or cheddar cheese
1/2 cup black soybeans, rinsed and drained (fresh 
soybeans are preferable, but you may use canned)
2 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup chunky salsa
Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish (optional)
 1 Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
 2 Place two tortillas on a large, nonstick baking sheet. (If you use a regular baking sheet, 
spray it with nonstick cooking spray first.) Sprinkle half the cheese on the two tortillas.
 3 In a small bowl, combine soybeans, green onions, cilantro, garlic, and cumin. Mix 
lightly, and then spoon this bean mixture evenly over the cheese on the tortillas.
 4 Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the beans, top with the remaining tortillas, press 
down on the top of each tortilla slightly, and spray each top tortilla with cooking spray.
 5 Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the tortillas are lightly browned and the cheese is melted.
 6 Remove from oven and cool slightly. Cut the tortillas into quarters and serve salsa on 
the side for dipping. Top with fresh cilantro if desired.

T Vegetable Pizza
A typical pizza is dripping with grease from processed meats and too much cheese. Our 
pizza is leaner with less cheese and no greasy meat, so it has fewer calories than a regu-
lar pizza. Our pizza is better for you, too, because the crust is made with whole grains 
and the toppings include superfood vegetables.

 Chapter 17: Gathering for the Family Meal: Superfood Main Dish Recipes
Prep time: About 20 minutes
Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes
Yield: 16 servings (2 pizzas)
4 cups whole-wheat flour
2 tablespoons active dry yeast
11/2 teaspoons salt
2 cups warm water (about 120 degrees)
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon sugar
6-ounce can tomato paste
8-ounce can tomato sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced
1/2 green pepper, thinly sliced
1/2 red pepper, thinly sliced
1 large tomato, sliced and seeded
1 cup sliced mushrooms (any variety)
1 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
10-ounce package frozen spinach, thawed 
and drained
1 cup chopped green olives
1 cup chopped broccoli
16 ounces shredded part-skim (low-fat) 
mozzarella cheese
 1 Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
 2 Pour flour into a mixing bowl. Stir in yeast and salt. Add water, oil, and sugar, and mix 
well. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place it in a warm area for 30 to 40 minutes 
to rise.
 3 While the crust is rising, combine tomato paste, tomato sauce, garlic, remaining table-
spoon of olive oil, salt, sugar, oregano, marjoram, basil, black pepper, and cayenne 
pepper in a mixing bowl; stir to mix thoroughly.
 4 Punch down the dough, remove it from the bowl, and divide it in half. With a rolling pin, 
roll each half out until it’s about 12 to 13 inches in diameter. Transfer the dough onto 
two greased, 14-inch pizza pans, and press out the edges.
 5 Divide the sauce mixture between the two crusts, ladling it out and spreading it to 
within 1/2 inch of the edges.
 6 Spread the veggie toppings evenly over the crusts. Sprinkle cheese over the top of each 
pizza.
 7 Bake on the bottom rack of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until crust is golden brown

Trout Amandine
Trout has a mild flavor and is rich in omega-3 fatty acids; almonds are rich in healthy 
fats. Our version of trout almandine calls for poaching, which is a very healthful way to 
prepare fish.
Prep time: About 10 minutes
Cooking time: 17 to 19 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1/4 cup slivered almonds
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/3 cup lemon juice (or 2 to 3 fresh lemons, 
squeezed)
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
2 fillets of trout (6 to 8 ounces each)
1 fresh lemon
 1 Place almonds in small, nonstick skillet and toast over medium heat. Stir frequently 
until the almonds are slightly brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
 2 Pour wine, lemon juice, parsley, green onions, salt, and pepper into a large, nonstick 
skillet over medium heat and cook until the mixture begins to boil, about 4 minutes.
 3 Reduce to low heat and then add trout fillets. Cover the skillet to poach the fish until 
the flesh is opaque and flaky, about 10 minutes.
 4 While fish is poaching, slice lemon.

Tuna Melt Wraps
This sandwich recipe contains five superfoods — tuna, spinach, tomato, olive oil, and 
avocado. These warm wraps are easy to make and go nicely with a side salad or cup of 
soup. If you don’t want to use a broiler, you can use your microwave oven.
Prep time: About 10 minutes
Cooking time: 2 to 3 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
2 whole-wheat tortillas
5 ounces canned tuna (regular or albacore), 
drained
1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1 cup fresh spinach leaves
1/2 cup diced tomato
1/4 cup diced avocado
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Preheat broiler to high.
 2 Place tortillas on a baking sheet. Place half the tuna in the middle of each tortilla, and 
sprinkle with cheese (divide the cheese between the two tortillas).
 3 Place in the broiler until cheese is melted and tuna is warm, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
Remove from the broiler.
 4 Transfer the tortillas to a clean cutting board. Add half of the spinach leaves, tomato, 
and avocado to each tortilla. Drizzle about 1 teaspoon of olive oil and balsamic vinegar 
over each. Add salt and pepper.
 5 Fold up one quarter of each tortilla to form the bottom. Roll the sides in to form a cone 
shape, with the top open.
Tip: You can make these melts in the microwave instead of the broiler if you prefer. To do 
so, place a tortilla on a microwave-safe plate and top with tuna and cheese. Cook on high 
until cheese is melted, about 1 to 11/2 minutes (microwave oven times can vary greatly).

Filling Your Plate: Super Salad 
and Side Dish Recipes
In This Chapter
▶ Using salads and sides to up your fruit and veggie 
consumption
▶ Creating dishes your family will love
S
alads and sides dishes are perfect for intro-
ducing superfoods into your lifestyle. In this 
chapter, we offer some tips for making delicious 
and healthy salads and side dishes, along with 
some of our favorite recipes.
Making Sides and Salads 
Super Healthy
We suggest that you eat five to nine servings of 
fruits and vegetables of different colors every day 
to get a variety of antioxidant-rich phytochemi-
cals, fiber, and nutrients (see Chapters 4 and 5). 
You can get several of those servings by making 
salads and side dishes that include some of the 
fruit and vegetable superfoods.
The ingredients and cooking method called for in a recipe determine how 
healthy the resulting side or salad will be. When you page through your cook-
books (or surf online) to find healthy salads and side dishes, look for recipes 
that include
 
✓ Fruits, vegetables, or legumes as main ingredients
 
✓ Healthful oils such as olive, walnut, or canola oil

✓ Only small amounts of sugar (or, better yet, none at all)
 
✓ Cooking methods that don’t add extra fat and calories — baking, roasting, 
sautéing, and stir-frying
 
If your favorite recipes don’t include superfoods as ingredients, you can make 
them a little bit healthier by making substitutions like these:
 
✓ Use dried cranberries instead of raisins in slaws and salads.
 
✓ Substitute albacore tuna for chicken in salads.
 
✓ Start your salad with raw spinach leaves instead of iceberg lettuce.
 
✓ Top your salad with pecans or sunflower seeds instead of croutons.
 
✓ Replace vegetable oil with olive oil.
Making Super Salads and Sides
These recipes are all created with superfoods, along with other ingredients 
that are good for you. Many of them don’t require any cooking time — all you 
need are a few ingredients and a few minutes to prepare them. And several of 
them are easy enough that you can enlist the help of your children.
Serving up super salads
Serve up a healthy salad to go alongside a sandwich at lunch or in place of a 
vegetable at dinner. You can also enjoy one of these salads as a delicious and 
healthy afternoon snack — say, when you’re hungry and dinner is still three 
hours away.
 
T Apple Carrot Salad
Apples, carrots, and cranberries are rich in nutrients and antioxidants. This recipe calls 
for a light mayonnaise to keep your fat intake down. Alternately, you could use a may-
onnaise made with an omega-3-rich oil such as canola oil.
Prep time: About 5 to 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings

In This Chapter
▶ Snacking on sensational superfoods
▶ Serving superfoods starters
▶ Dressing up your desserts
You may think it isn’t possible to eat snacks, 
appetizers, and desserts that are both deli-
cious and healthy for you. Actually, though, these 
items offer a great way to incorporate superfoods 
into your day.
In this chapter, we provide some tips on choos-
ing and preparing easy snacks, appetizers, and 
desserts, as well as the best ways to get the most 
superfoods in each portion. We also offer a few of 
our favorite healthy and yummy recipes to try out.
Satisfying Cravings with Superfoods
Many people who want to lose weight believe that snacking is their biggest 
problem. They think that snacking automatically means eating too much. The 
truth is that snacking can be good for you. Eating snacks throughout the day 
can help regulate your body’s insulin response and control cravings.
 
It’s not snacking that causes you to gain weight; it’s the foods that you choose 
to snack on. Snacking can actually be a great way to watch your weight when 
you choose the right foods.

Part IV: Putting Superfoods on Your Table 
Many of the superfoods make the simplest, healthiest snacks in their natural, 
whole state. What could be easier than grabbing an apple from your fruit 
bowl, munching on a handful of mixed nuts, or dipping broccoli pieces into 
your favorite veggie dip?
 
When you combine two or more superfoods, you can use their different 
flavors and textures to satisfy most of your cravings, without ruining your 
healthy superfoods diet. The following are a few delicious examples:
 
✓ Apples and almond butter: Slice up a sweet-tangy apple, like a Gala, 
and serve with a little almond butter. The apple gives you crunchy and 
sweet, while the almond butter gives you savory, smooth, and just a 
little salt. Of course, if you don’t have almond butter, you can use peanut 
butter and still get good nutrition.
 
✓ Mixed berries with whipped topping and nuts: Another great combi-
nation is a mix of fresh blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries with 
a dollop of low-calorie whipped topping and a sprinkling of walnuts or 
pecans. This is just as delicious as a fattening ice cream sundae and so 
much better for you.
 
✓ Veggies and dip: Raw vegetables can not only tame your craving for 
savory foods, but because superfood vegetables are loaded with fiber, 
they also keep you feeling full. Dip some carrot slices into your favorite 
salad dressing. Or, instead of regular chip dip, dip some baked chips 
into tomato salsa or guacamole.
Super Snack, Appetizer, 
and Dessert Recipes
Superfoods make great snacks just as they are, but we know there are times 
when you want something more. Maybe you need a great appetizer to take 
to a party, or maybe you just want something new to snack on. In that case, 
you’ve come to the right place. Here are some recipes for delicious snacks, 
appetizers, and desserts that feature superfoods, so you can serve healthy 
snacks to your family and make delicious desserts that won’t bust your diet.

pes that are easy to make when you need a little something to eat and it’s not 
quite lunch or dinnertime.

healthy berry mocha smoothie at home.
Prep time: About 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1/2 cup cold coffee (brewed strong)
1/4 cup milk
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 
(not Dutch processed)

2 teaspoons sugar or sucralose
1 banana, frozen and cut into 1-inch pieces
4 large strawberries
1/2 cup ice cubes

T Chia Fruit Smoothie
This chia smoothie makes a great snack for any time of the day. The chia seed can 
absorb ten times its weight, so it has a strong filling effect and a sustained release of 
energy. Of the plant-based superfoods, chia also has one of the highest concentrations 
of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. This smoothie just gets more super with the banana 
and berries, which are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.
Prep time: About 20 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 to 2 tablespoons chia seeds
12 ounces water
1 banana, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup berries, any types
 1 Grind chia seeds in a coffee grinder until finely ground. If you don’t have a coffee 
grinder, you can use a hand grinder or put the seeds in a sealable plastic bag and break 
them up with a rolling pin. If none of these options appeals to you, you can use whole 
chia seeds.
 2 In a blender, combine the seeds and water. Blend 4 to 10 seconds on low speed.
 3 Add the banana pieces and berries to the blender. Blend on medium to high speed until 
smooth.
Tip: Use frozen fruit for a thicker smoothie.

8 almonds, chopped
1 scoop of your favorite berry- or vanilla-flavored 
protein shake mix (look for mixes with fewer than 
5g carbs and near 25g protein per serving)
8 to 10 ounces regular, light, or low-carb vanilla 
soy milk
1 tablespoon whole or ground chia seed
1/4 cup frozen or fresh blueberries

T Hummus and Pita
Hummus is a spread made from garbanzo beans and sesame seed paste called tahini. 
Hummus is traditionally served with slices of pita bread. It makes a delicious appetizer 
that’s high in protein, fiber, and minerals.
Prep time: About 10 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
6 cloves garlic
15-ounce can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
11/2 tablespoons tahini
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 whole-wheat pitas, cut into 6 wedges
 
 Process the garlic cloves in a food processer for 2 to 3 seconds. Add the remaining 
ingredients and process for 5 minutes, until smooth. Serve as a dip for pita wedges.
Tip: You can buy tahini in the international foods aisles of many grocery stores, or you can 
make your own by combining 5 cups toasted sesame seeds with 11/2 cups olive oil and 
blending for 2 minutes in a blender or food processor. Tahini stores well in the refrigerator 
for up to 3 months.

This snack is made with plenty of almonds, which are an excellent source of vitamin E, 
magnesium, tryptophan (an amino acid), and fats that help keep your heart healthy.

idea for the holiday season. You can always double the recipe for bigger parties.
Prep time: 10 to 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
1 egg white
1/4 teaspoon salt

 3 Add the salt, cinnamon, and syrup to the egg white, and mix well.
 4 Stir in the almonds, and then spread the mixture on the baking sheet.
 5 Bake for 25 minutes until dry. Break into pieces, and store in an airtight container.

Starting off with superfood appetizers
An appetizer is a small amount of food or drink that is served before a meal 
to stimulate appetite. Sometimes when you order appetizers, they’re so large 
and filling that instead of stimulating your appetite they satisfy your appetite 
altogether. Keep portion control in mind when you make these appetizers.

cious dish extra-healthy by choosing omega-3 enriched mayonnaise.

Refrigeration time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 avocados, peeled and pitted
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon lemon or lime juice
1 teaspoon grated onion
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 cup light mayonnaise

Salmon Lettuce Wraps
This dish is a great way to eat salmon, which is rich in omega-3 fats and protein. This 
recipe could easily be added to the main dish section, but when sliced into finger food 
it makes a great starter. It also contains tomatoes, garlic, and other fine herbs. If you 
serve it as an appetizer, you can eat leftovers for a snack the next day.
Prep time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons fresh ginger, roughly chopped
1/4 cup fresh cilantro
1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and roughly chopped
1 small onion, roughly chopped
2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 tablespoons fresh-squeezed lime juice
1 large tomato, roughly chopped
2 fresh salmon fillets (about 6 ounces each)

spinach leaves
Lime wedges, for serving
 1 Preheat broiler to high.
 2 Combine the ginger, cilantro, jalapeño pepper, onion, garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and 
lime juice in a food processor, and process until chopped and mixed. Add the tomato 
and process again. Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate.
 3 Lightly coat the salmon fillets with the rest of the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Place fillets 
on a foil-lined baking sheet and broil for 20 minutes, or until salmon is firm and pink.
 4 Separate lettuce leaves from the head. Fill with small pieces of the flaked broiled salmon 
and the ginger mixture from Step 2. Top with fresh lime juice when serving.
Tip: The salsa may seem watery if you let it sit too long before using it in the wraps (or if 
you have leftovers), but a quick stir will get it back to the right consistency.

and salt, and mix well. Stir in the egg and milk mixture, and let it all stand for 5 minutes.
 3 Shape the salmon mixture into 5 equally sized cakes, each about 1-inch thick.
 4 Place a large skillet over medium heat, and add the olive oil. Sauté the salmon cakes 
until golden, about 4 minutes on each side.
Tip: If the mixture is too crumbly when you start to form the cakes, add 1 or 2 more table-
spoons milk to help it bind together.
Tip: Serve the salmon cakes with an easy, almost-homemade lemon dill sauce by combin-
ing 1/4 cup light dill veggie dip (such as T. Marzetti’s) with 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 
1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce, and 2 to 3 tablespoons nonfat milk.

Delving into not-too-decadent desserts
It’s what you’ve been waiting for — desserts. Yes, you can actually incorporate 
superfoods into desserts. If you think any dessert with superfoods must be 
super tasteless, think again. The important thing to remember is that anytime 
you can get some of the superfoods into your eating structure, you should do 
it. Read on for some super desserts that you can serve with a smile.

 1 Preheat oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray 2 baking sheets with nonstick cooking 
spray.
 2 Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer for a few minutes until they’re creamy white 
and smooth. Add salt. Continue beating while slowly adding sugar substitute and 
extracts. Beat until the egg whites form stiff peaks (dip the tip of a spoon in them, invert 
it, and the resulting point of beaten egg white should stand up on its own).
 3 Fold in chopped almonds.
 4 Use a teaspoon to quickly drop batter onto cookie sheets, lifting the spoon at the end to 
create peaks.
 5 Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until lightly brown and firm to the touch. Transfer to a wire

Part IV: Putting Superfoods on Your Table 
 
T Baked Apples
This old favorite is packed with some great superfoods. Furthermore, apples come in 
three colors to choose from, all of which are different in taste or texture. With almonds, 
cranberries, and even a touch of cinnamon, this recipe is great on everyone’s table — 
but remember portion control!
Some types of apples don’t cook as well as others, so pay attention to the apples that 
we suggest for this recipe. If you’d like to try another type of apple, ask your grocer for 
a recommendation, or just keep in mind that you may not get the same results.
Prep time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 60 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons chopped almonds
2 tablespoons dried cranberries
2 tablespoons brown sugar or brown sugar 
sucralose
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
4 large apples, such as Gala, Rome, Golden 
Delicious, or Granny Smith
3/4 cup apple juice
2 tablespoons canola oil
Light whipped topping, for serving

each apple. Place apples upright in nonstick or glass baking dish.
 4 Spoon 1/4 of the sugar mixture into each apple.
 5 Pour the apple juice into the dish, and drizzle canola oil over each apple. Cover the 
apples with aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour, or until apples are tender. Serve apples 
as they are, or add a small amount of light whipped topping.

In this part . . .
I
n this part we provide some information “snacks,” so 
to speak, about superfoods. We list ten super-duper 
superfoods, our top choices for super supplements, and 
great tips for getting superfoods into your diet every day. 
Finally, we note ten almost-superfoods — runners-up to 
our list of superfoods that are worthy of honorable 
mention.

Chapter 20
Ten Super-Duper Superfoods
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the health benefits of the best superfoods
▶ Discovering ways to incorporate the top superfoods in your diet
▶ Finding out where to buy the best superfoods
T
he list of superfoods is long, and you may be wondering which foods 
pack the biggest nutritional punch. Or maybe you’re just getting started 
with superfoods, and you want to choose a few that can make the biggest 
impact on your health.
Here, we list the best of the best: our top ten superfoods. We chose these ten 
foods based on nutritional content, versatility, availability, and ease of storage.
Blueberries
The rich dark color in blueberries provides lots of antioxidants that protect 
the cells in your body from damage by free radicals. This damage can come 
from a variety of factors, including too much sun exposure, pollution, foods 
with unhealthy fats, and even as a by-product of normal metabolism. In fact, 
blueberries have more antioxidants than any other commercially grown fruit 
(see Chapter 4).
Being good for you is one thing, but in order for a food to become a regular 
part of your diet, it has to taste good, too. Blueberries rise to the challenge. 
They don’t require much preparation; just rinse them and enjoy. You can 
eat them plain or sprinkle a half cup of blueberries on your morning cereal. 
Blueberries add flavor and extra nutrition to warm, whole-wheat muffins, too.
 
Blueberries are available year-round, but the best time to buy them is during 
the summer months, when you can find them at local farmers’ markets and 
sometimes at pick-your-own blueberry farms. Blueberries keep for a few days 
in the refrigerator, and they freeze very well.

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Salmon
Many of the superfoods contain healthy fats, especially fish (see Chapter 7). 
Salmon stands head and shoulders (or should that be fins?) above the others 
because salmon has the most omega-3 fats of all the superfoods in the fish 
category. Salmon is also a source of several vitamins and minerals and has 
plenty of protein.
Grill or broil your salmon steaks to serve as a main dish. Salmon chunks work 
well in salmon cakes (see Chapter 19) or in salmon sandwiches (just take 
care not to overdo the high-fat mayonnaise).
Fresh salmon may be available in the seafood or meat department of your 
local grocery store, or you can buy frozen salmon steaks from the freezer 
section. You can buy cans of salmon chunks, too.
 
Some canned salmon contains skin and bones. If you don’t mind, you can eat 
the salmon bones because they’re a good source of calcium. Or you can check 
the label for cans of salmon meat only.
Spinach
The deep green pigments in spinach contain several antioxidants, including 
lutein, which helps keep your vision clear (see Chapter 5). You also get your 
daily dose of vitamins A and K and most of the manganese (an important 
trace mineral) and folate (water-soluble B vitamin) you need. Eating spinach 
even provides calcium and iron. And the calories in spinach are so few that 
they hardly count.
You can use raw spinach leaves in place of iceberg lettuce in your salads or 
on sandwiches. Spinach makes a delicious side dish (see Chapter 18 for a 
recipe), or you can use it to boost the nutritional value of spaghetti, pizza, 
and even macaroni and cheese.
Fresh spinach leaves are available at your grocery store in the produce sec-
tion, and you can buy canned or frozen spinach, too. In the summer, you can 
find spinach at local farmers’ markets, or you can grow it yourself in your 
own superfoods garden (see Chapter 14).

305
 Chapter 20: Ten Super-Duper Superfoods
Tomatoes
The luscious red color of red tomatoes (especially in the form of heat-
processed tomato sauces) contains an antioxidant called lycopene that 
helps keep your heart healthy (see Chapter 5). Eating one tomato gives you 
half the vitamin C you need for the day. Tomatoes are also a good source of 
fiber, which helps keep your digestive system healthy.
Slice a big tomato and serve it with mozzarella cheese, basil leaves, and a 
drizzle of olive oil for a salad, or add chunks of tomatoes to a traditional 
garden salad. Tomatoes are the base for many sauces, soups and stews, and 
condiments.
Your grocery store is likely to carry some interesting varieties of tomatoes. 
Large, round tomatoes can be sliced or cut into chunks and are very versa-
tile, while plum tomatoes are smaller with less juice. There are several types 
of cherry or grape tomatoes — cute as can be, and perfect for perching on a 
salad. Whole, sliced, or stewed tomatoes (in the canned vegetables aisle of 
your grocery store) are useful for recipes.
 
You can grow many different varieties of tomatoes in your garden or in a large 
pot on your deck (see Chapter 14 for more on growing superfoods).
Olive Oil
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, which take care of your heart by 
decreasing your LDL cholesterol (the bad kind) and raising your HDL choles-
terol (the good kind). Virgin olive oil also contains polyphenols (natural sub-
stances that have health benefits), making it even better for your heart (see 
Chapter 9).
Use olive oil to make salad dressings (just combine a little balsamic vinegar 
with the olive oil) or to add flavor to vegetables. You can use olive oil infused 
with herbs or peppers to add interesting flavors to many dishes — but don’t 
attempt to make your own flavored oils, as botulism is a concern. Olive oil is 
good for cooking, too, because it has a high smoking point.
Olive oils differ in flavor (and even in color) depending on the varieties of 
olives used and even where they’re grown. Virgin and extra virgin olive oils 
contain less acid than regular olive oil and have a much better flavor (and 
more of those polyphenols).

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Almonds
Almonds contain vitamin E, minerals, and monounsaturated fats (like the 
kind found in olive oil) that fight bad cholesterol. Eating almonds may help to 
keep your heart healthy and protect you from diabetes (see Chapter 6).
Grab a handful of almonds to eat as a snack, or sprinkle sliced or slivered 
almonds on a salad. Almonds add a nice crunch to a bowl of berries and 
make a tasty topper for green vegetables.
Your grocery store should have both raw and roasted almonds. They may be 
whole, sliced, slivered, or chopped, which makes them very versatile. Some 
specialty stores also carry almond butter, a delicious alternative to peanut 
butter. Store your almonds in airtight containers or bags to keep them fresh.
 
If you only have whole almonds and you need smaller pieces, you can use 
your coffee grinder to chop them up.
Oats
Oats are our favorite whole grain. Eating oatmeal helps control cholesterol 
levels because it contains beta-glucan, a type of soluble dietary fiber that 
binds to and removes cholesterol from your body. Oats may also help to 
keep your blood vessels healthy (see Chapter 8).
Start your morning with a bowl of hot oatmeal or a whole-grain oat cereal, 
such as Cheerios. Choose low-fat and low-sugar oatmeal muffins and cookies. 
Substitute oats for breadcrumbs or part of the wheat flour in some of your 
recipes.
You can find a variety of oats in the cereal section of grocery stores — 
steel-cut, old-fashioned (rolled), quick-cooking, and instant. Steel-cut oatmeal 
takes the longest to cook. Old-fashioned oatmeal takes less time because the 
oats are rolled thin compared to the steel-cut variety. Quick-cooking oats are 
even thinner than old-fashioned oatmeal. Instant oatmeal has been cooked 
and dehydrated and is ready almost as soon as you add hot water.
 
When you buy instant oatmeal, be sure to read the label on the box. Some 
brands contain quite a lot of sugar and extra calories you may not want.

307
 Chapter 20: Ten Super-Duper Superfoods
Garlic
Garlic may be best-known for keeping vampires away — at least in some old B 
movies — but in reality, garlic helps to ward off heart disease and cancer (see 
Chapter 9). Garlic lowers cholesterol and helps to lower your blood pressure 
if it’s too high. Eating garlic regularly may also help you fight infections.
Make garlic bread by first drizzling olive oil on whole-wheat bread, then 
spreading some roasted garlic on the bread. Top off with a little parmesan 
cheese, and toast in the oven until golden brown.
Fresh garlic is available in the produce department. You can also buy pre-
peeled and -chopped garlic in jars — talk about convenient. Garlic is easy to 
grow and can make a nice addition to your superfoods garden. Just be sure 
to let the garlic dry (or cure) for about two weeks after you harvest it.
 
Fresh garlic is easy to peel if you first put the cloves into the microwave for 
about 5 to 10 seconds. The papery skin slides right off.
Strawberries
The rich red color in strawberries provides antioxidants, and one serving 
gives you all the vitamin C you need for the whole day. Strawberries also 
contain folate — an important B vitamin — and potassium to keep your heart 
healthy. The phenols in strawberries may help to protect you from cancer, 
cardiovascular disease, and rheumatoid arthritis (see Chapter 4).
Strawberries are very sweet, so they don’t need extra sugar. Add strawber-
ries to cold or hot cereal or make them part of a salad (see Chapter 18). 
Combine fresh strawberries with blueberries and raspberries and top with 
light whipped topping for a sweet and healthy dessert, or dip some large 
strawberries into dark chocolate for a decadent treat.
Fresh strawberries are available year-round in the produce section of the 
grocery store, but they may be best during the spring and summer months, 
when, like blueberries, they’re available at pick-your-own strawberry farms 
or local farmers’ markets. You can also find strawberries in the freezer sec-
tion (look out for added sugar), and you can grow strawberries in your own 
backyard garden.

308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Chia Seeds
These little seeds come from Mexico and are members of the mint family. 
Chia seeds are very high in omega-3 fatty acids (even higher than flax seeds) 
and rich in antioxidants (see Chapter 10). Chia seeds form a gel when 
exposed to liquids in your stomach. Experts believe eating chia seeds slows 
down carbohydrate absorption to keep you feeling full longer. This gel forma-
tion can also soothe heartburn and keep your stomach calm.
Chia seeds have a nutty flavor that goes well with many other foods. Sprinkle 
chia seeds on salads, vegetables, and cereals, and add them to recipes for 
baked goods, like muffins.
You may not find chia seeds in your local grocery yet, but look for them to be 
hitting major chains in the near future. In the meantime, you can find them 
online or in specialty health food stores. We know this requires a little extra 
effort, but chia seeds are so beneficial to your health, they’re worth it.

Chapter 21
Ten Sensational Dietary 
Supplements
In this Chapter
▶ Looking at the top ten superfood supplements
▶ Seeing why these supplements are so special
▶ Finding out how much to take and where to buy them
O
ne of the recurring themes in this book is the importance of getting 
your nutrition by eating whole superfoods whenever possible. But 
given today’s busy lifestyles and people’s various food preferences, getting 
great nutrition all the time can be difficult. Thus, adding a superfood supple-
ment or two may be a great help.
With the availability of so many different supplements, how do you know 
which ones to choose? We give you our favorites here, but in general, look for 
supplements that offer a variety of vitamins, minerals, and extra antioxidants 
without a lot of added sugars and calories. You can choose pills, powders, or 
liquids — whichever works best for you and your family.
Because supplements vary in daily dosage recommendations, you may find 
one fits your needs better than another. You may not need as much as the 
label suggests, just remember that any research done with these supple-
ments was based on specific amounts. More important, don’t take more than 
what the labels recommend unless directed by a medical professional. See 
Chapter 3 for more information on taking dietary supplements.
 
Supplements don’t replace real food; they simply fill in some of the nutritional 
gaps in your diet. Your first priority is to boost your diet with a variety of 
superfoods. Supplements take second place, because they often lack chemi-
cals that are found in the raw foods and are important for absorption and 
digestion.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Vibe
Vibe is the signature product of the Eniva Corporation and is an excellent 
overall dietary supplement. The great thing about Vibe is that it’s a bunch of 
superfood supplements all in one. Eniva takes pride in the quality of both the 
ingredients and the processing of its products.
Vibe meets the recommended daily amounts of many nutrients and, after 
much research, the Eniva team was able to formulate the product by a spe-
cial process that enhances the absorption and bioavailability — the amount 
of nutrition value left after the supplement is metabolized by the body. Vibe 
was formulated to have a small particle size so it’s easy for your body to 
absorb and use.
Vibe is one of the more complete supplements on the market. It contains the 
extracts of several superfoods, including green tea, blueberries, goji berry, 
tomatoes, and apples. One ounce of Vibe has:
 
✓ The antioxidant equivalent of 96 blueberries
 
✓ The vitamin A equivalent of 13 tomatoes
 
✓ The green tea extract equivalent of 5 cups of tea
 
✓ The selenium equivalent of 30 heads of broccoli.
VIBE gives you the power of many superfoods in a 1-ounce dose, and you can 
take one or two doses each day. Go to www.eniva.com for more information.
 
This liquid has a quick delivery system, and some people may experience 
flushing due to the fast absorption of the niacin. This reaction goes away 
quickly, but if you’re sensitive to niacin, you should talk to you doctor about 
some things you can do to help reduce the symptoms of the niacin flush.
Prime One
The formulation of this supplement is based on research done by scientists 
from the Soviet Union. The research was focused on adaptogens (biologically 
active substances found in plants that help the body deal with various stres-
sors). Adaptogens often contain high concentrations of antioxidants, too, 
which is part of the reason that they’ve been the center of so many clinical 
studies.

311
 Chapter 21: Ten Sensational Dietary Supplements
The potential benefits of Prime One make this supplement worth mentioning 
in our top ten. This liquid supplement is a blend of several plant extracts that 
were combined after doing tests on hundreds of plants. The studies revealed 
improvements in athletic performance, mental alertness, and improved gen-
eral well-being. With a focus on reducing the effects of stressors on the body, 
this supplement helps the body heal and keeps it from expressing the normal 
negative effects of stress.
The recommended dose of Prime One is 1 to 2 tablespoons, depending on 
your age. (We recommend that you start with half the dosing for the first 
week.) Each 2-tablespoon serving has about 10 calories and about 2 grams of 
carbohydrates. It can be taken alone, or mixed with milk or juice. Prime One 
can be given to children beginning at age one. Check out the Web site www.
iamams.com for more information on Prime One.
Dr. Shulze’s SuperFood Plus
Dr. Schulze’s has a whole line of reputable nutritional supplements that have 
been used by happy consumers for years. For the purposes of this book, our 
focus is on Dr. Shulze’s SuperFood Plus Formula, which is an excellent fit for 
our top ten. Like Vibe, this product is a multi-superfood supplement with 
plenty of health benefits.
This formula contains a few of the exotic superfoods and is a great choice for 
those interested in supplementing with algae, seaweed, and wheat grass. Dr. 
Shulze uses three types of algae, including spirulina (see Chapter 10 for more 
info). Algae is one of the most concentrated sources of protein and has 40 
times the amount of protein in another superfood, soybeans.
SuperFood Plus also contains wheat grass, which is a great source of many 
vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. Other healthful ingredients the supple-
ment includes are blue-green algae, chlorella broken-cell algae, barley, alfalfa, 
Purple Dulse seaweed, Acerola cherry, rose hips, palm fruit, lemon and 
orange peels, beet root, and spinach leaf.
The recommended dose of Dr. Shulze’s SuperFood Plus is 1 to 2 tablespoons 
per day. You can mix the powder with milk or juice, or even use it in a 
smoothie. You can also get this in tablet form, but the recommended dosage 
is up to 13 tablets per day, so many people find the powder easier to use. Go 
to www.dr-shulze.com for more information.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
HD Food: Oranges
Do you want a substitute for your morning coffee? HD Food: Oranges from 
HealthDesigns is a powdered drink mix full of important nutrients that sup-
port energy, making it a great starter for people who need that pick-me-up in 
the morning. The amino acids, adaptogens, catechins (plant chemicals that 
have antioxidant properties), protein, and fiber are provided in a small (10-
gram) serving size with less than 50 calories.
The drink contains green coffee bean and green tea extracts that provide 
energy-boosting polyphenols (caffeic and chlorogenic acids), while Panax 
ginseng helps control the release of stress hormones. HD Food: Oranges also 
contains good nutrition from a blend of fruits and vegetables that are pro-
vided in each serving:
 
✓ Fruits: Oranges, peaches, nectarines, tangerines, cantaloupe, pineapple, 
clementines, papaya, apricot, mango, kumquat, and persimmons
 
✓ Vegetables: Yams, pumpkin, carrots, butternut squash, and rutabaga
One serving provides 2 grams of soluble fiber and 6 grams of carbohydrates. 
Go to www.healthdesigns.com for more information on getting HD Food: 
Oranges into your daily routine.
Sambazon Power Scoop
Sambazon Power Scoop is a popular supplement because its star ingredient 
is a great superfood: açaí berries. Originating in Brazil, each açaí berry is 
about the size of a blueberry, but even more powerful. Açaí berries contain 
twice the antioxidant activity of blueberries and substantially more antioxi-
dant power than red wine.
Sambazon has both liquid and powder supplements that contain the açaí 
berry. The açaí berry offers plenty of health benefits due to the anthocyanins — 
plant pigments found in the skins of fruits and vegetables that have high anti-
oxidant activity. They add some important fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals 
to make this a great option for daily nutrition.
The recommended dose of Sambazon Power Scoop is 1 to 2 scoops a day 
added to your favorite juice, milk, or smoothie. You can also get the capsule 
form and take 2 to 4 capsules daily. Go to www.Sambazon.com for more 
information on this superfood supplement.

313
 Chapter 21: Ten Sensational Dietary Supplements
FRS Healthy Energy
FRS stands for Free Radical Scavengers, and the natural antioxidant quercetin 
(a bioflavonoid found in the skins of some fruits and vegetables) leads this 
supplement in the battle against free radical damage. Several studies, includ-
ing one published in the Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism in 
2006, support the use of FRS for brain function, immune system support, and 
boosting athletic performance.
FRS Healthy Energy was developed by Harvard graduates to fight fatigue and 
to supplement general nutrition. They discovered that high levels of quercetin 
in the form of a supplement offered more than just an energy boost; they actu-
ally improved recovery time of elite athletes after heavy workouts. FRS Healthy 
Energy also includes green tea extract, B vitamins, vitamin C, and caffeine.
FRS is available in a few different supplemental forms to meet your needs. It 
comes in a ready-to-drink can, soft chews, powder, and liquid concentrate. 
The drinks are low-calorie and come in a few different flavors. Go to www.
frs.com for more information on how to purchase this supplement.
 
FRS contains caffeine (about what you would find in half a cup of coffee) so if 
you’re sensitive to caffeine, have any medical conditions, or take prescription 
medications, you should check with your doctor to see whether this supple-
ment is safe for you.
Green Tea Extract
Green tea extract is often added to supplements such as HD Food: Oranges 
and FRS Healthy Energy (both discussed earlier in this chapter), but it also 
makes a great supplement by itself. This superfood supplement is prized for 
its high amounts of polyphenols, the plant-derived antioxidants that are the 
hallmark of green tea’s health benefits.
The main polyphenols in green tea are called catechins. Studies have shown 
that consuming green tea may reduce your risk for several cancers and heart 
disease. Green tea has also been used for weight loss and diabetes control.
Although some people like to drink more than 6 cups of this superfood every 
day, you don’t have to. Several great green tea supplements come in pow-
ders, capsules, pills, and liquid drops and can replace some of the tea you’d 
normally drink. You can compare the efficacy by the amounts of catechins in 
each serving. You may find a high dose of green tea in the multi-nutritional 
mixes, but if you’re looking solely for green tea, there are several brands to 
choose from. Check out your local health food or grocery stores to find some 
green tea products.

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Green tea supplements contain caffeine in varying amounts. If you’re sensitive 
to caffeine, have any medical conditions, or use prescription medications, 
make sure you discuss the use of these supplements with your doctor.
Amazing Grass
Wheat grass is a superfood that has been used for thousands of years for 
health and nutrition. Taking a dose of Amazing Grass can make up for those 
days when you don’t get enough servings of fruits or vegetables. Ounce per 
ounce, wheat grass has a higher content of nutrition than vegetables.
Amazing Grass is good for digestive health, immune boosting, and energy, 
and it’s gluten-free. It contains high concentrations of phytonutrients, the 
driving force behind wheat grass’s health benefits. It’s a great source of vita-
mins and minerals and a complete source of amino acids. Amazing Grass is a 
low-calorie, low-carb liquid supplement that contains two grams of fiber per 
serving.
Amazing Grass comes in pills or a powder form to be mixed into a drink. 
The tablets are made from wheat grass powder and an organic binder. The 
serving size is 8 tablets per day or an 8-gram serving (a little over 1/4 ounce) 
of the powder, and you can take 1 to 3 servings per day. Go to www.amazing
grass.com for more information on Amazing Grass. (See Chapter 10 for 
more information on wheat grass.)
 
Many people who are sensitive to wheat can actually use Amazing Grass. 
Wheat grass does not contain any wheat grain (which is where gluten is 
stored), so it has no gluten. If you have any questions about your ability to use 
wheat grass supplements, check with your doctor.
Trim Fuel Bar
The Trim Fuel Bar is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. The main super-
foods in this supplemental bar are chia seeds and soy. It also has extra vita-
min B12, fiber, and protein.
Chia is the leading plant source of omega-3 fatty acids. Your body metabo-
lizes the seeds slowly, so they can be used for sustained energy and for 
weight loss. The seeds can absorb 10 times their weight in water, so chia is 
very filling. Chia also stabilizes blood sugars so your body doesn’t need to 
make more insulin. The bar tastes great; it’s a great snack option for children 
and an easy way to give them their daily amount of omega 3s.

315
 Chapter 21: Ten Sensational Dietary Supplements
The bar is a great option for those who are watching their weight. The 
34-gram (a little over 1 ounce) bar has only 130 calories, with 8 grams of 
protein, 5 grams of fiber, and less than 5 grams of impact carbohydrates. We 
recommend one or two bars every day as a meal replacement for weight loss, 
or as a healthy snack alternative. Go to www.trimlifestyle.com for more 
information on the Trim Fuel Bar (and see Chapter 10 for more information 
on chia and its benefits).
Lovaza
This is the only supplement on our superfood list that you can get only by 
prescription. We thought it was worth mentioning due to the medical benefit 
of Lovaza’s main ingredient, omega-3 fatty acids. Although a prescription 
supplement, it’s made from all natural fish oils.
Omega-3 fatty acids reduce triglycerides (a type of cholesterol found in the 
blood stream that can lead to thickening of artery walls), so taking Lovaza 
can improve your cardiovascular health. It has also been associated with 
weight loss and may help to improve brain function. Studies have been done 
related to the roles of omega-3 fatty acids in diseases such as autism and 
Alzheimer’s. See Chapter 7 for more information on fish and omega-3 fatty 
acids.
Each capsule of Lovaza contains 465 milligrams eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 
and 375 milligrams docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the two forms of omega-3 
fatty acids found in fish. Lovaza contains higher concentrations of EPA and 
DHA than most dietary supplements, so the recommended dose of Lovaza 
is 4 capsules per day. You can talk to your doctor to see whether you would 
benefit from getting a prescription for Lovaza.

Ten (Plus) Ways to Make Sure You 
Get Your Daily Superfoods
In This Chapter
▶ Finding ways to eat more fruits and vegetables
▶ Snacking with superfoods
▶ Making a super healthy salad
T
rying to incorporate superfoods into your diet may seem overwhelming, 
but there are easy ways to do it. Here we present our top ten (plus one) 
tips for making sure you get your daily superfoods.
You don’t need to follow every single step we list here. Just choose the ones 
that work best for you and your family.
Making Over Your Recipes
Substituting or adding superfoods as ingredients in your recipes is an easy 
way to add superfoods to your diet. Start with a healthy recipe — one that 
doesn’t use a lot of sugar or high-fat ingredients (or cooking methods, like 
deep frying). Look for ingredients you can replace with superfoods. For exam-
ple, use olive oil in place of regular vegetable oil, or substitute tuna chunks 
for chopped chicken in your favorite sandwich. Tofu can be used in place of 
meat in a stir-fry. Alternatively, you can add a superfood to your recipe with-
out subtracting anything in its place. For example, add cooked and drained 
spinach to mashed potatoes or add broccoli bits to spaghetti sauce. Add a 
handful of blueberries to your favorite oatmeal, or use them to top off a deli-
cious salad.
Sometimes, you can adjust your recipes to enhance superfoods. When you 
make a beef stew, cut back on the amount of meat and add extra carrots and 
other vegetables to make up the difference. This makes your stew healthier 
by adding extra nutrients and more fiber, and it cuts calories, too.

318

Putting Superfoods in Easy Reach
Thank goodness for refrigeration — many of our superfoods would spoil 
quickly without it. But don’t put all your superfoods in the bottom of the 
produce drawer. Keep a few of them out in the open where you can see them 
(and hide the cookie jar instead).
 
Fruits like bananas, apples, and oranges keep well at room temperature for 
several days, so load up a pretty fruit bowl and place it on the kitchen counter 
or your dining room table. This way, you and your family will be tempted by 
superfoods rather than not-so-healthy snacks like cookies and candy. You can 
also store mixed nuts such as almonds, pecans, and walnuts in a pretty glass 
jar on the counter instead of leaving them in a crumpled bag in the back of 
the cabinet. A fresh crisp apple with a handful of walnuts makes for a terrific 
midafternoon snack.
Going Vegetarian
You don’t need to give up meat to get healthy. However, many vegetarian 
dishes are loaded with superfoods, so enjoying a vegetarian meal once or 
twice each week can help you increase your superfood intake. Vegetarian 
meals also tend to be very high in nutrients and fiber while being low in calo-
ries, so you can fill up with good-sized portions.
 
When you’re looking for vegetarian meals to substitute for the usual meaty 
fare, look for dishes that include plenty of protein. A combination of protein 
and fiber keeps you feeling full long after the meal is done. Good sources of 
protein include
 
✓ Dry beans, such as black beans and navy beans
 
✓ Soy products, such as tofu
 
✓ Nuts, such as almonds and walnuts
You can go vegetarian at lunch by choosing a veggie sandwich with a side of 
carrot sticks, hummus, and vegetable dip rather than a greasy cheeseburger 
with fries. This delivers a lot more nutrition and fewer calories than a typical 
fast-food lunch.

319
 Chapter 22: Ten (Plus) Ways to Make Sure You Get Your Daily Superfoods
Choosing Five to Nine Fruits 
and Vegetables
It’s no secret that fruits and vegetables are good for you, and many of the 
superfoods fall in this category. Aim for a certain number of servings (we sug-
gest seven or more — but at least five) every day. Here’s a sample menu to 
give you ideas about how to get those servings of fruits and vegetables:
 
✓ Breakfast: Top your bowl of cereal with 1/2 cup of berries or a sliced 
banana, or have a vegetable omelet.
 
✓ Lunch: Add tomato, lettuce, onions, and sprouts to a sandwich and 
serve with a side salad or a cup of vegetable soup.
 
✓ Dinner: Divide your dinner plate into four equal sections. A serving of 
meat, chicken, or fish should take up one section. Another section is for 
a starchy vegetable like potatoes or corn, and the remaining two sec-
tions are for green or colorful vegetables or salad greens.
 
✓ Snacks: Select a fresh piece of fruit; raw carrots, broccoli, and cauli-
flower with veggie dip; or yogurt with 1/2 cup of berries.
 
✓ Beverages count, too: Four ounces of 100 percent fruit or vegetable 
juice count as a serving, so one large (12-ounce) glass of juice could 
equal three servings. (See the upcoming section, “Drinking Superfood 
Beverages.”)
Keeping Healthy Snacks on Hand
Snacking is fine. In fact, it’s a great way to boost your energy and tide you 
over until your next meal. And it offers a great opportunity to add superfoods 
to your diet.
Next time you go to the grocery store, look for snack items that will increase 
your intake of superfoods. Ready-to-eat, superfood snacks include frozen 
juice bars (without added sugar), dried berries, bananas and apples, nuts, 
and sun-dried tomatoes.
You can upgrade your regular snacks, too. If you normally dunk your tortilla 
chips into nacho cheese sauce while watching TV, switch to baked chips 
that are lower in unhealthy fats, and use them to scoop up superfood-rich 
guacamole or spicy salsa. Replace that nightly ice cream sundae with low-fat 
yogurt topped with lots of blueberries and strawberries.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Drinking Superfood Beverages
Many superfood juices are available in your grocery store, such as pomegran-
ate, orange, apple, blueberry, and tomato juice. Read the labels and choose 
100 percent fruit or vegetable juices that don’t have added sugar or high-fruc-
tose corn syrup. Why? Sugar and corn syrup add calories but no nutrition, 
while 100 percent juices offer lots of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals.
Think about how your beverages can add to your daily superfood intake. 
Replace that bottle of soda with 100 percent fruit juice. If you miss the fizz, 
mix the juice with some sparkling mineral water. If you normally drink coffee 
or black tea, try brewing some green tea instead. Or make some refreshing 
iced green tea during the warm days of summer.
You can take your superfood juices one step further by buying a juicing 
machine so that you can make your own fruit and vegetable juices at home. 
Choose a machine that keeps the fiber and pulp in the juice for maximum 
nutrition.
Eating a Rainbow
Pay attention to the colors of the foods you eat. The pigments that give the 
fruits and vegetables their beautiful colors also give you healthful antioxi-
dants. Different colors of fruits and vegetables may have slightly different 
health benefits, so eat a variety of colors.
 
Superfood vegetables are green, red, and orange; superfood fruits are red, 
blue, orange, and yellow. Fill out your food rainbow with superfood nuts and 
seeds (brown) and fish (pink or white).
Maybe your favorites are the greens and browns, but make sure you get 
some yellows and oranges in your daily intake of superfoods, too. You need 
all the colors of the superfoods rainbow to maximize nutrition and health.
 
By selecting a few different colors of superfoods every day, you can be sure 
you’re getting an excellent assortment of phytochemicals and the number of 
servings of fruits and vegetables you need.

321
 Chapter 22: Ten (Plus) Ways to Make Sure You Get Your Daily Superfoods
Planning for Superfoods on the Go
If you travel frequently, you know how easy it is to slip into the fast-food rut 
of low-cost, not-so-nutritious fare. But you don’t need to sacrifice your health 
when you find yourself eating convenient travel meals.
Add superfoods at fast-food restaurants by choosing side salads instead of 
French fries, and order an orange juice instead of a soda. When you go to a 
sit-down restaurant, start with a salad or vegetable soup, choose baked fish 
when it’s available, and don’t forget to eat your vegetables.
As an alternative to restaurant meals, get a small cooler and stop at the gro-
cery store to buy healthy snacks that can go on the road with you. No need 
to grab a candy bar or a bag of potato chips if you have a cooler filled with 
fresh berries, crunchy vegetables, and sweet juicy apples.
 
When you travel by air, you probably don’t want to lug an extra cooler with 
you, so choose convenient dehydrated superfoods that won’t take up much 
space in your carry-on bag. Blend your own trail-mix by choosing dried ber-
ries and fruits, almonds, walnuts, and some whole grain cereal. You can even 
toss in a few dark chocolate pieces to tame your sweet tooth.
Taking Advantage of 
Seasonal Superfoods
While much of the produce you buy in the grocery store is available year-
round, there’s something to be said for eating produce while it’s in season. 
For one thing, fruits and vegetables are often less expensive when they’re in 
season. (This is great news for preventing colds and flu, because orange and 
citrus season starts just before cold and flu season.)
Another reason for taking advantage of seasonal foods is the opportunity 
to support local farming. Plus, fresh, locally grown produce is bursting with 
flavor because it’s harvested closer to peak ripeness.
When fresh seasonal superfoods are available, you can buy them in larger 
quantities and freeze or can them to enjoy throughout the year. See Chapter 
15 for tips.

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Dipping with Vegetables 
Rather than Chips
Instead of opening a bag of chips, serve sliced raw carrots, crunchy green 
beans, and broccoli florets with a variety of dips. If your family is getting 
tired of the same old veggie dip, bring out their favorite chip dips and cheese 
sauce.
The secret to making this work is to have the vegetables ready to go so 
they’re ready when your family is hungry. You can prepare the veggies 
ahead of time and keep them in a container in the fridge, or, if you’re pressed 
for time, you can buy them already cut and washed at the grocery store. 
(Remember, though, that you’ll pay more for this convenience.)
Eating a Salad
Some people love salads, and others just see them as something to pick at 
before the real meal starts. But whether you enjoy a salad as a meal or are 
only grudgingly willing to eat one before a meal, a salad is a great way to add 
lots of superfoods to your diet.
Go beyond the typical small garden salad (iceberg lettuce, a slice or two of 
cucumber, little tomatoes, and lots of croutons, drowned in high-fat dressing) 
by choosing a superfood salad instead. You can do this whether you’re in 
your own kitchen or serving yourself at a restaurant salad bar.
Start with spinach or dark greens along with your regular lettuce. Add lots 
of cherry tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, and olives, or other avail-
able vegetables. For extra flavor (and flavonoids), sprinkle some blueberries 
or dried cranberries on top. Skip the croutons and add some flax seeds or 
sunflower seeds. Finally, avoid that high-fat salad dressing. Keep it light with 
a little balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil or walnut oil.

Ten (Plus) Almost-Superfoods that 
Can Help Round Out Your Diet
In This Chapter
▶ Rounding out your superfoods diet with other healthful foods
▶ Finding substitutes for high-fat red meats
▶ Enjoying even more healthful vegetables
S
everal foods fall short of the truly “super” standard, but they’re still 
good for you. These are what we call almost-superfoods. We chose these 
foods using the same criteria we used for our superfoods — nutrient content, 
types of fats, and the availability of phytonutrients. Using the best prepara-
tion and cooking methods is the best way to keep these foods almost-super 
(see Chapter 15).
In this chapter, we’ve come up with ten almost-superfoods that are delicious, 
usually easy to find in grocery stores, and add variety to your diet while 
keeping you healthy.
Whole Grains
Most of the bread, buns, cereals, and pasta you see lining the shelves in your 
local grocery store are made from refined white wheat flour. When flour is 
refined, the fiber- and nutrient-rich bran and covering are removed, leav-
ing flour that yields a softer texture for baked goods and a milder flavor for 
pasta. Most flour is enriched with iron and B vitamins, which is good, but 
you’re still missing a good bit of fiber.
Whole-grain products retain the fiber and natural nutrients found in grains, 
such as wheat, barley, and spelt (similar to wheat but with a sweeter, nuttier 
flavor). Eating 100 percent whole-grain cereal, baked goods, and pasta adds 
fiber to your diet and helps slow down the digestion and absorption of the 
starches in the grain. Most people consume grains on a daily basis; we rec-
ommend incorporating at least three servings of whole grains every day.

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Look for “100 percent whole wheat” or “100 percent whole grain” on the ingre-
dients list to be sure the product you’re buying is really made from the whole 
grain.
Increase your intake of whole grains by substituting whole-wheat flour for 
part of the refined flour in your favorite recipes. Chapters 16 through 19 
include several recipes with whole-wheat flour and no refined white flour.
Poultry
Chicken and turkey are lower in saturated fats than beef and are often used in 
place of red meat in low-fat diets to reduce the cholesterol-raising and inflam-
matory effects of eating saturated fat. Much of the fat in poultry is contained in 
the skin, so you can keep your chicken or turkey low-fat by removing the skin.
One cup of cooked chicken breast meat without the skin has only 1 gram of 
saturated fat and slightly more than 200 calories (dark meat from the legs 
and thighs has a little more fat and calories). Turkey has even less saturated 
fat than chicken.
 
Buy a whole chicken or turkey and roast the bird in the oven, and then remove 
the skin before serving (roasting with the skin on makes the meat more flavor-
ful). You’ll have enough for dinner and lots of leftovers that you can use for 
other meals. Add cooked, chopped turkey or chicken to a regular garden salad 
to turn it into a full meal. Or make healthful sandwiches on 100 percent whole-
grain bread, with a slice of cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce.
You can also find organic, free-range poultry, which means the birds were 
raised in healthier conditions and were not exposed to hormones or antibiot-
ics. Organic and free-range poultry is more expensive, but it’s becoming more 
popular every year.
Bison
The meat from American Bison (and game meat such as venison and elk) is 
much lower in fat than other red meat, and can serve as a delicious substi-
tute for beef. Bison tastes very similar to beef, but is actually a bit richer.
 
Bison can be used in most dishes that call for beef; however, since bison 
is lower in fat, you’ll have better results if you use lower temperatures for 
cooking, especially for ground bison. Bison steaks can be prepared just like 
beef. They’re best if not cooked past medium doneness (about 145 degrees 
Fahrenheit measured with a meat thermometer), meaning the steak is still 
pink in the middle.

325
 Chapter 23: Ten (Plus) Almost-Superfoods that Can Help Round Out Your Diet
Depending on where you live, bison may be available in your local grocery 
store, or you may have to travel to a larger store or purchase it online. You 
can also use venison (deer meat) or elk to replace beef in your diet. They 
have similar nutritional profiles, but a slightly gamier (but still delicious!) 
flavor.
Yogurt
Eating yogurt is a great way to get calcium into your diet, plus yogurt con-
tains friendly bacteria that happily populate your digestive system. The bac-
teria help to keep your digestive system healthy by keeping the bad bacteria 
and yeast at bay, while the good bacteria make short-chain fatty acids that 
help to maintain and repair the walls of your digestive tract.
Some brands of yogurt contain added live bacterial cultures called probiotics 
that increase the amount and type of friendly bacteria in the yogurt. Eating 
these brands of yogurt may improve regularity, and may even reduce the 
symptoms of other digestive disorders.
Yogurt is available in a wide variety of flavors. You need to read the label to 
be sure you’re not ruining the nutritional value of your yogurt by adding too 
many calories. One cup of non-fat yogurt has less than 90 calories, but sugar 
and high-fructose corn syrup can ratchet the count up to over 200 calories.
 
To save calories, choose brands that are sweetened with Splenda, or buy plain 
yogurt and add just a touch of sweetness with a little honey and plenty of 
freshly sliced fruit.
Snap Beans
The nutritional content of green and yellow snap beans makes them a great 
addition to any superfoods diet. The mild flavor and versatility means that 
fussy eaters can enjoy these vegetables. Snap beans are low in calories and 
are a good source of vitamin C, potassium, and folate. Green snap beans are 
also rich in vitamin A, lutein, and beta-carotene, which trigger antioxidant 
activity to help prevent damage to the cells in your body.
Green and yellow snap beans are easy to find in the grocery store. Fresh or 
frozen are best; however, they’re available in cans, too — just watch out for 
added sodium. Snap beans are frequently cooked and served as a side dish 
(top them with some almonds and olive oil — two of our superfoods). Green 
beans are also a favorite ingredient in many casseroles (just beware of added 
fat and calories).

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Raw snap beans taste great and have a wonderful crunch. Try serving them 
with your favorite vegetable dip or as a healthful ingredient in your salads.
Cabbage
Cabbage is a good source of vitamin C, vitamin K, and sulphorophane, a phy-
tochemical that may help to fight cancer. According to the journal Cancer 
Letter in 2008, diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, reduce 
the risk of colon and prostate cancer.
You can find fresh cabbage (and possibly red cabbage) in the produce sec-
tion of every grocery store; look in the deli for premade slaws and salads. 
Store-bought cole slaw is usually fattened up with creamy dressings, but you 
can make a healthier slaw at home by using a wine or vinegar-based dressing 
instead.
Add cabbage pieces to soups and stews, or sauté some cabbage in a little 
olive oil with onions. You can eat a lot of cabbage without harming your diet: 
One cup of raw shredded cabbage has only 18 calories.
Winter Squash
You can find fresh squash in the produce section of your grocery store. 
Winter squash comes in several varieties, including butternut, acorn, and 
turban squash, plus pumpkins. The bright orange flesh contains lots of vita-
min A and carotenoids (phytochemicals related to vitamin A) such as beta-
carotene and lutein, which help to keep your vision normal.
Winter squash is also a good source of calcium, potassium, and vitamin C, 
while remaining low in calories. One cup of cooked, cubed squash has fewer 
than 100 calories.
To cook a squash, slice it in half, scoop out the seeds and pulp, and place 
both halves, cut side down, in a baking dish. Then add one inch of water. 
Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until the flesh is soft when you pierce the rind 
with a sharp knife. Serve the orange flesh with a little olive oil or walnut oil, 
salt, and pepper.
 
Save the seeds and toast them for a healthy snack. Pumpkin seeds are rich in 
omega-3 fatty acids (see Chapter 6 for information on how to toast pumpkin 
seeds).

327
 Chapter 23: Ten (Plus) Almost-Superfoods that Can Help Round Out Your Diet
Cauliflower
Like the other cruciferous vegetables (kale, broccoli, and cabbage), cauli-
flower contains sulphorophanes that help reduce your risk of some cancers. 
Cauliflower is rich in vitamin C and potassium, contains substantial amounts 
of folate (a B vitamin), and is very low in calories.
In addition to finding cauliflower in the produce section of the grocery store, 
you can find it in the frozen foods section. It’s available as a single vegetable 
or in a variety of blends with other vegetables like broccoli. Just watch out 
for high-calorie sauces and sodium.
Add raw cauliflower florets to salads or use them to scoop up a tasty vegeta-
ble dip. Or serve steamed cauliflower as a side dish. Simply remove the outer 
green leaves, break the florets into bite-sized pieces, and steam for about 
eight minutes.
Canola Oil
Canola oil is good for you because it’s rich in both monounsaturated fats (like 
olive oil) and omega-3 fatty acids (like flax oil). The healthful fats in canola 
oil are good for your cardiovascular system and help reduce inflammation. 
Canola oil is also low in omega-6 fatty acids. These kinds of fatty acids are 
good for you in small amounts, but they may increase inflammation in your 
body when consumed in large amounts.
Canola oil is good for cooking because it has a very light flavor compared to 
the stronger taste of olive oil, and canola oil stands up to heat much better 
than flax oil, which breaks down quickly when exposed to the high tempera-
tures of cooking.
You can avoid saturated fats when you use canola oil in place of butter 
because canola is very low in saturated fat. There are also several products 
made with canola oil, such as mayonnaise and margarine (look for foods 
marked “trans-fat free”).
Grapes
Grapes contain polyphenols such as resveratrol, anthocyanins, and other fla-
vonoids that help reduce inflammation. According to an article published in 
2001 in the journal Circulation, subjects who drank grape juice every day for 

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
two weeks had better blood flow. Red wine remains the superfood because 
the fermentation improves the absorption of the polyphenols (see Chapter 
9). However, grapes are close behind, and grape juice is a good choice for 
those who don’t drink alcohol.
Grapes contain B vitamins, vitamin C, and potassium. One cup of grapes has 
only 62 calories, so eating a cup of grapes may help tame your sweet tooth 
without adding a lot of calories.
Choose grapes with dark purple colors because they have the highest con-
centrations of phytochemicals. You should store your grapes in the refrigera-
tor; you also can freeze grapes, which turns them into a cool summertime 
treat. Enjoy grapes as a snack or drink grape juice as a beverage.
Raisins are dehydrated grapes. They’re very sweet because the natural 
sugars are more concentrated. However, a study published in 2008 in the 
journal Nutrition Research found that raisins don’t have the same negative 
impact on your blood sugar as other sweets, which may be important for 
people who have diabetes.
Raisins don’t have the same nutritional content as grapes because some 
nutrients are lost during dehydration. Raisins do, however, retain some of the 
phytochemicals like oleanolic acid, which may fight tooth decay by reducing 
the bacteria in your mouth.
Mangos
Mangos are sometimes considered to be an exotic fruit, but they’re becom-
ing more popular and therefore easier to find in grocery stores. Their golden 
yellow flesh tastes something like a cross between a peach and a pineapple.
Mangos are rich in vitamin A and vitamin C, plus a phytochemical called 
lupeol that, according to a 2008 article in the journal Nutrition and Cancer, 
combats prostate cancer cells in the lab. Mangos also contain another phy-
tochemical called mangiferin that may help to prevent cancer and immune 
system diseases, according to research published in the journal Biochemical 
Pharmacology in 2003.
Mangos can be eaten alone or used in salads, fruit smoothies, and salsas. 
Ignore the color of the mango when you’re picking one out. Instead, gently 
squeeze the fruit; it should be slightly soft when it’s ripe. Firm mangos can 
ripen at home at room temperature. Once they’re ripe, they can be stored in 
the refrigerator for up to five days.
