Why Equity in 
Compensation 
Matters
Do you compensate your employees fairly?
Answering that question is not as simple as you might think. There are a 
variety of ways it could be interpreted. The question could pertain to the 
policies and procedures used to make compensation decisions. It could be 
asking about the actual compensation outcomes. Or it could relate to how 
each employee feels about the compensation decision-making process, his 
or her actual compensation outcome, what information was communicated 
about the decision-making process and compensation outcome, and how that 
information was communicated.
One way to approach the concept of fairness is from an organizational justice 
perspective. Organizational justice theorists argue that fairness, at its core, has 
four dimensions:
1.	 Distributive justice.
2.	 Procedural justice.
3.	 Interactional justice.
4.	 Informational justice.

Distributive justice is the perceived fairness of the actual outcome. When we 
talk about equity and fairness of bonus payments, merit increases in base salary, 
or the size of promotional increases, we are talking about distributive justice. 
Distributive justice answers the question, “Did I receive what I should have 
received?” When we talk about intentional discrimination in pay, we are typically 
discussing distributive justice: whether the money was distributed among the 
employees equitably, given the compensation policies and practices.1
Procedural justice is the perceived fairness of the policies and procedures 
used to arrive at the actual outcomes. Procedural justice includes the criteria 
used to determine bonus payments, how merit increases in base salary are 
determined, and the guidelines governing the size of promotional increases. 
Procedural justice answers the question, “Was what I received determined 
fairly?” When we talk about unintentional discrimination in pay, we’re typically 
discussing procedural justice: whether the rules we use to distribute money 
affect different groups of employees differently.2
Interactional justice is the perceived fairness of the treatment received in the 
application of the actual outcome. It refers to the “warm fuzzy” or “cold 
prickly” feeling we get based on the way the outcome is presented to us. 
Interactional justice answers the question, “Was I treated with politeness,  
dignity, and respect?”
Informational justice is the perceived fairness or adequacy of the information 
provided regarding the actual outcome. In the realm of compensation, this 
idea is frequently referred to as transparency. Without informational justice, 
there can be no overall fairness. An organization’s compensation decisions 
could be internally equitable, based on objective and well-defined factors, and 
communicated with the utmost courtesy and respect. However, if the only 
communication is “your bonus is $X” or “your merit increase is Y%” and no 
supporting information is provided, the decision may be interpreted as unfair.
Even if employees disagree with the actual outcome and/or the policies and 
procedures used to arrive at it, they are more likely to perceive decisions as 
fair if they understand how those decisions were made.

is discussed in Chapter 2.
2Unintentional discrimination is referred to in the legal lexicon as disparate impact, which 
is discussed in Chapter 2.

Fairness is both science and art. Within the context of this book, we focus 
on the scientific aspects of fairness. Specifically, we address statistical testing 
of compensation outcomes for disparate treatment and statistical testing of 
compensation policies and practices for disparate impact. Broadly speaking, we 
focus on distributional justice and procedural justice. Issues of interactional 
justice and informational justice are outside of the scope of this book.
Before discussing the statistical examination of compensation for discrimina-
tion, it is important to put the issue of internal pay equity into context. This 
can best be accomplished by reviewing federal equal pay laws and regulations 
in recent history.
Federal Equal Pay Laws and Regulatory 
Climate of the Twentieth Century
Figure 1-1 provides an overview of the equal pay laws of the twentieth cen-
tury. As can be seen, the first equal pay policy was implemented in 1918 by 
the War Labor Board. World War I saw the entrance of women into the 
manufacturing workforce to take the place of male employees serving in the 
military. Under an equal pay policy implemented by the War Labor Board, 
manufacturers were obligated to pay female employees the same wages paid 
to their male counterparts.3

With the arrival of World War II in the 1940s, an even greater number of 
women entered the workforce. The majority of these women were hired into 
positions within war industries, and for many it was the first time they were 
employed outside of the home.
Nearly a quarter of a century after the War Labor Board enacted the first 
equal pay policy, it encouraged employers to make “adjustments which [would] 
equalize wage or salary rates paid to females with the rates paid to males for 
comparable quality and quantity of work on the same or similar operations.”4 
Around this same time, the “Women’s Equal Pay Act of 1945” was introduced to 
the U.S. Senate. Neither this bill nor similar bills introduced in the 1950s were 
passed. The 1960s ushered in major reforms to civil rights in the United States, 
and pay equity was part of this sea of change. The Equal Pay Act was signed into 
law by John F. Kennedy on June 10, 1963. Under this act, it became illegal to pay 
employees lower wages than their counterparts on the basis of sex:
No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section 
shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are 
employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to 
employees in such establishments at a rate less than the rate at which 
he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishments 
for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, 
effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working 
conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority 
system, (ii) a merit system, (iii) a system which measures earnings by 
quantity or quality of production, or (iv) a differential based on any other 
factor other than sex: provided, that an employer who is paying a wage rate 
differential in violation of this subsection shall not, in order to comply with 
the provisions of this subsection, reduce the wage rate of any employee.
The following year, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed into law. Title VII 
spoke specifically to employment practices. Under Title VII, the following are 
unlawful employment practices:
1.	 To fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or 
otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect 
to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of 
employment, because of such individual’s race, color, reli­
gion, sex or national origin.
2.	 To limit, segregate, or classify employees or applicants for 
employment in any way which would deprive or tend to 
deprive any individual of employment opportunities or other­
wise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of 
such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.

With the passage of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, age 
became a protected characteristic as well. The act made it unlawful for an 
employer:
1.	 To fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or 
otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect 
to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of 
employment because of such individual’s age.
2.	 To limit, segregate, or classify employees in any way which 
would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of 
employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his 
status as an employee because of such individual’s age.
3.	 To reduce the wage rate of any employee in order to comply 
with this chapter.
The issue of discrimination against individuals on the basis of disability status 
came to the forefront in the early 1970s. It wasn’t until 1988, however, that the 
first Americans with Disabilities Act was introduced in Congress. On July 26,  
1990, President George H. W. Bush signed the bill in to law. The Americans 
with Disabilities Act made it unlawful for an employer to discriminate on the 
basis of disability status. Specifically, the Americans with Disabilities Act states 
that no covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the 
basis of disability in regard to job application procedures; the hiring, advance-
ment, or discharge of employees; employee compensation; job training; and 
other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.
Equal Pay Laws and Regulations in the  
Twenty-first Century
Among the equal pay laws and regulations of the twenty-first century, the Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 is probably the most recognized. Other regula-
tory changes have been championed by the National Equal Pay Enforcement 
Task Force, a little-known federal body that is dramatically altering the 
regulatory climate with respect to equal pay and pay discrimination.
The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
The issue of pay discrimination again rose to a position of prominence in 2007 
when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire 
and Rubber Co. The case began in 1998 when Lilly Ledbetter, a production 
supervisor at a Goodyear tire plant in Alabama, filed an equal pay claim under 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 alleging pay discrimination. After years 
in the lower courts, the case finally appeared before the Supreme Court. 

Compensating Your Employees Fairly

Interestingly, the question addressed by the Supreme Court was not whether 
Goodyear had discriminated against Ledbetter; instead, the court addressed 
a technical issue in the case. Specifically, the court considered whether 
Ledbetter’s complaint was time-barred because the discriminatory compen-
sation decisions had been made more than 180 days prior to the filing of her 
charge of discrimination.
On May 29, 2007, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote that Ledbetter’s claim 
was in fact time-barred. Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the court:
Ledbetter’s arguments here—that the paychecks that she received during 
the charging period and the 1998 raise denial each violated Title VII and 
triggered a new EEOC charging period—cannot be reconciled with Evans, 
Ricks, Lorance, and Morgan. Ledbetter, as noted, makes no claim that 
intentionally discriminatory conduct occurred during the charging period or 
that discriminatory decisions that occurred prior to that period were not 
communicated to her. Instead, she argues simply that Goodyear’s conduct 
during the charging period gave present effect to discriminatory conduct 
outside of that period. . . . But current effects alone cannot breathe life into 
prior, uncharged discrimination; as we held in Evans, such effects in themselves 
have “no present legal consequences.” 431 U.S., at 558. Ledbetter should have 
filed an EEOC charge within 180 days after each allegedly discriminatory pay 
decision was made and communicated to her. She did not do so, and the 
paychecks that were issued to her during the 180 days prior to the filing of 
her EEOC charge do not provide a basis for overcoming that prior failure.5
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated:
The Court’s insistence on immediate contest overlooks common 
characteristics of any discrimination. Pay disparities often occur, as they did 
in Ledbetter’s case, in small increments; cause to suspect that discrimination 
is at work develops only over time. . . . Small initial discrepancies may not 
be seen as meet for a federal case, particularly when the employee, trying 
to succeed in a nontraditional environment, is averse to making waves.
Pay disparities are thus significantly different from adverse actions “such 
as termination, failure to promote, . . . or refusal to hire,” all involving fully 
communicated discrete acts, “easy to identify” as discriminatory. . . . It is only 
when the disparity becomes apparent and sizable, e.g., through future 
raises calculated as a percentage of current salaries, than an employee 
in Ledbetter’s situation is likely to comprehend her plight and, therefore, 
to complain. Her initial readiness to give her employer the benefit of the 
doubt should not preclude her from later challenging the then current and 
continuing payment of a wage depressed on account of her sex.6

Ginsburg concluded the dissenting opinion with the following statement:
This is not the first time the Court has order a cramped interpretation of 
Title VII, incompatible with the statute’s broad remedial purpose. . . . Once 
again, the ball is in Congress’s court. As in 1991, the Legislature may act 
to correct this Court’s parsimonious reading of Title VII.7
Approximately two weeks after the ruling, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer 
and Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller announced 
their intent to introduce legislation that would “make it clear” that discrimina-
tion occurs not only when the discriminatory decision is made but also when 
an individual becomes subject to that discriminatory decision, and when an 
individual is affected by the discriminatory decision, including each time they 
are issued a discriminatory paycheck. 
The bill was originally defeated in 2008 and was reintroduced in January 2009. 
It passed in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and was signed 
in to law on January 29, 2009, by President Barack Obama.
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and modified 
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973. The amendments clarify that a discriminatory compensation decision 
or other practice that is unlawful under such acts occurs each time compen-
sation is paid pursuant to the discriminatory compensation decision or other 
practice.8 
National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force
In his January 27, 2010, State of the Union address, President Obama stated: 
“We’re going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws—so that women 
get equal pay for an equal day’s work.”9 As a result of this renewed com-
mitment to equal pay, the National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force was 
created.10 The interagency task force consists of members from four differ-
ent agencies: the Department of Labor, the Office of Personnel Management, 
the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC).

10At the time of its creation, the interagency group was known as the National Equal Pay 
Enforcement Task Force. In 2012, however, the group referred to itself as the Equal Pay 
Task Force. See, for example, “Equal Pay Task Force Accomplishments,” White House, April 
2012, www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/equal_pay_task_force.pdf.

The task force has been instrumental in changing the ways regulatory agencies 
such as the EEOC and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs 
(OFCCP) initiate investigations of pay discrimination, the compensation data 
and information employers are required to provide to the regulatory agencies, 
and the analysis methods the regulatory agencies use in making a determination 
of whether pay discrimination occurred. 
For example, at the urging of the task force, the EEOC has begun its Equal 
Pay Act Directed Investigation Pilot Program. Under this program, the EEOC 
is exercising its authority to initiate investigations of compensation discrimina-
tion at its discretion, rather than only in response to a claim of compensation   
discrimination.11 The OFCCP is planning on rescinding the Interpretive Standards   
for Systemic Compensation Discrimination, which outlined the methodology the 
agency would use in examining contractor compensation data for pay discrimina-
tion. The Standards will be replaced by ad hoc analysis methods that are “consistent 
with broad Title VII principles.”12 In addition to complete discretion in the selec-
tion of analysis tools and methodology, OFCCP is also proposing to dramatically 
increase the types and amounts of contractor compensation data it collects.13
As a result of task force recommendations and proposed legislation, employ-
ers are facing increased scrutiny of their compensation policies and practices, 
while simultaneously receiving little guidance about how their practices will 
be examined and how to avoid potential violations of evolving regulations.
Proposed Legislation
As of this writing, there are two pieces of proposed legislation regarding 
pay equity under consideration. Although both bills are aimed at improving 
pay equity and eliminating compensation discrimination, they approach the 
problem differently. The Fair Pay Act of 2011 focuses on remedying occupa-
tional segregation. The hope is that with less segregation of women and racial 
minorities into lower-wage occupations, wage differentials by gender and race 
will be lessened or even eliminated.
The second piece of legislation—the Paycheck Fairness Act—is concerned 
with the gender pay gap. The act centers around modifying employer defenses 
to claims of gender discrimination in compensation and enhancing the legal 
remedies available to victims of pay discrimination, namely, compensatory and 
punitive damages.

The Fair Pay Act of 2011
On April 12, 2011, the Fair Pay Act of 2011 was introduced into the Senate 
by Tom Harkin and into the House of Representatives by Eleanor Holmes 
Norton. The act seeks to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to 
prohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex, race, or 
national origin. 
The impetus for the act is occupational segregation.14 The bill references the 
existence of wage rate differentials between equivalent jobs segregated by sex, 
race, and national origin and proposes to remedy the situation as follows.15
(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no employer having 
employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, 
within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between 
employees on the basis of sex, race or national origin by paying wages to 
employees in such establishment in a job that is dominated by employees 
of a particular sex, race or national origin at a rate less than the rate at 
which the employer pays wages to employees in such establishment in 
another job that is dominated by employees of the opposite sex or of a 
different race or national origin, respectively, for work on equivalent jobs.
(B) Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall prohibit the payment of different 
wage rates to employees where such payment is made pursuant to 
(i) a seniority system, (ii) a merit system, (iii) a system that measures 
earnings by quantity or quality of production, or (iv) a differential based 
on a bona fide factor other than sex, race or national origin, such as 
education, training, or experience, except that this clause shall apply only 
if the employer demonstrates that (aa) such factor is job-related with 
respect to the position in question or (bb) furthers a legitimate business 
purpose. . . .
(C) The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall issue guidelines 
specifying criteria for determining whether a job is dominated by employees 
of a particular sex, race or national origin. . . .
(D) An employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of 
subparagraph (A) shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of such 
paragraph, reduce the wage rate of any employee.
The act was referred to the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor 
and Pensions on April 12, 2011, and was referred to the House Subcommittee 
on Workforce Protections on May 20, 2011.

On January 29, 2013 the act was reintroduced in the Senate as the Fair Pay 
Act of 2013.16 The future of the Fair Pay Act remains to be seen, and it is 
unclear whether any further action will be taken on it. This particular piece 
of proposed legislation has taken a back seat to the bill that has become the 
centerpiece of equal pay in recent times: the Paycheck Fairness Act.
The Paycheck Fairness Act
The Paycheck Fairness Act was first introduced into the House of Represen­
tatives by Rosa DeLauro on January 6, 2009, and into the Senate by Hillary 
Clinton on January 8, 2009. It was later reintroduced into the Senate by Harry 
Reid on September 13, 2010, and by Barbara Mikulski on April 12, 2011.
According to the text of the bill, the act seeks to amend the Fair Labor Standards 
Act of 1938 to provide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in 
the payment of wages on the basis of sex and for other purposes.
Specifically, the act would replace the “any factor other than sex” provision of 
the Fair Labor Standards Act with “a bona fide factor other than sex, such as 
education, training or experience,” and would add the following:
The bona fide factor defense . . . shall apply only if the employer demonstrates 
that such factor is (i) not based upon or derived from a sex-based 
differential in compensation; (ii) is job-related with respect to the position 
in question; and (iii) is consistent with business necessity. Such defense 
shall not apply where the employee demonstrates that an alternative 
employment practice exists that would serve the same business purpose 
without producing such differential and that the employer has refused to 
adopt such alternative practice.17
The Nonretaliation Provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act would also be 
amended as follows:
(a)(3)(A) has made a charge or filed any complaint or instituted or caused 
to be instituted any investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action under or 
related to this Act, including ay investigation conducted by the employer, or 
has testified or is planning to testify or has assisted or participated in any 
manner in any such investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, or has 
served or is planning to serve on an industry committee; or
(a)(3)(B) has inquired about, discussed, or disclosed the wages of the 
employee or another employee; and

17S. 168: The Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 438: The Paycheck Fairness Act.

Chapter 1 | Why Equity in Compensation Matters ﻿
12
(a)(3)(C) Subsection (a)(3)(B) shall not apply to instances in which an 
employee who has access to the wage information of other employees as a 
part of such employee’s essential job functions discloses the wages of such 
other employees to an individual who does not otherwise have access to such 
information, unless such disclosure is in response to a charge or complaint 
or in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action under 
section 6(d), including an investigation conducted by the employer. Nothing 
in this subsection shall be construed to limit the rights of an employee 
provided under any other provision of law.18
Additionally, the Paycheck Fairness Act would modify legal remedies available 
to victims of discrimination (i.e., compensatory and punitive damages); provide 
grants for negotiation skills training for girls and women; authorize research, edu-
cation, and outreach aimed at eliminating gender pay disparities; authorize the 
collection of pay information by the EEOC; and reinstate pay equity programs 
by OFCCP and pay equity data collection by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The Paycheck Fairness Act died in the Senate on June 5, 2012, when it failed 
to garner the sixty votes necessary to override a filibuster and be opened for 
debate on the Senate floor.
Given the priority status of gender pay equity and the Obama administration’s 
belief that the Paycheck Fairness Act is a “commonsense” piece of legislation 
with the power to end the gender pay gap and gender pay discrimination, it is 
very likely that it will be reintroduced to Congress in the near future.
The Business Case for Internal Pay Equity
Why should businesses care about internal pay equity? The simple answer is, 
because regulatory agencies and your employees care about internal pay equity.
The general argument for internal pay equity is a logical one: people who have 
similar responsibility levels within the organization and who are performing 
similar work requiring similar skills and abilities should be paid similarly.
From a risk management perspective, the argument for internal pay equity 
centers on litigation avoidance: if employees are paid equitably, the likelihood 
of a pay discrimination claim being filed against the organization is reduced. 
This, in turn, reduces the financial exposure of the company to damages 
­stemming from claims of pay discrimination. Additionally, if no claims of pay 
discrimination are filed, the company does not have to expend resources on 
legal services defending itself.19
18Ibid.
19Studies indicate that the average cost to a company of defending an employment practices 
claim in litigation is approximately $250,000. This estimate is exclusive of any damages, 
fines, or penalties assessed in the event the company is found liable.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
13
There is also a socioeconomic argument to be made for internal pay equity. 
In her 2012 Equal Pay Day address, Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis made the 
following statement:
Women now make up nearly half of the nation’s workforce, and  
60 percent of all women work full time. In almost two-thirds of families 
led by single mothers or two parents, mothers are either the primary or 
co-breadwinner. Pay equity is not simply a question of fairness; it is an 
economic imperative with serious implications not just for women, but for 
their families, their communities and our nation.20
In short, addressing the pay gap affects the earnings of women and minorities, 
their well-being, the well-being of their families, and the economy.
The arguments for internal pay equity from the logical, the risk management, and 
the socioeconomic perspectives are very straightforward. The business case 
for internal pay equity, however, is more complex. It involves business strategy, 
employee retention and engagement, productivity, and competitive advantage:
The company that helps give women control over their own lives . . . will 
see more women stay. It’s not a compliance issue; it’s not a diversity issue, 
and it’s not a social responsibility issue. Yes, it’s the right thing to do, but it’s 
also the strategic thing to do.21
Many have argued that internal pay equity provides businesses with competi-
tive advantages in attracting and retaining top talent in tight labor markets. 
Improving pay practices and ensuring internal pay equity allows companies 
to offer their employees and potential job candidates a compensation pack-
age based on objective and measurable criteria that can be explained in clear 
terms. This leads to higher rates of employee retention. High rates of employee 
retention, in turn, lead to lower costs associated with turnover. 
Additionally, internal pay equity can also lead to reductions in employee  
absenteeism, increases in employee performance and productivity, and 
improved motivation and employee engagement, as well as enhanced  
organizational innovation.
In fact, employers were cognizant of these benefits as early as 1951. In case 
studies conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor, management indicated

that internal pay equity improved employee morale, such that women’s atti-
tudes toward their work improved, their efficiency increased, and turnover 
was decreased.22
Although these kinds of arguments are frequently made, there is little analyti-
cal literature discussing the costs and benefits of internal pay equity. As noted 
by Marie-Thérèse Chicha, the empirical evaluation of pay equity policies has 
not received as much attention as the empirical evaluation of diversity man-
agement policies.23 The small amount of empirical literature that does exist 
is not specific enough and not deep enough to gain a clear understanding of 
the effectiveness—and usefulness—of pay equity policies. This literature is 
unsystematic and purely descriptive, offering no insight into the dynamics of 
pay equity policies.
This lack of empirical literature can be explained by two factors. First, to 
conduct a meaningful analysis, it is necessary to collect company information 
before and after the introduction of an internal pay equity policy and track 
these data over a number of years. It is difficult to obtain company-specific 
data, largely because companies are extremely reluctant to grant full access to 
their data. This reluctance is magnified where antidiscrimination policies are 
concerned. As noted by Chicha, “secrecy prevails and it is difficult to obtain 
the data required to make an assessment.”24
Second, even with full access to company data, it is very difficult to quantita-
tively define the precise linkages between internal pay equity and measures 
such as productivity, employee performance and motivation, and employee 
retention. There is no direct line of sight, for example, between internal pay 
equity and the quality of work produced by employees. Productivity, perfor-
mance, engagement, and retention are complex issues that are affected by a 
variety of social and psychological factors. 
For example, one study found that work-role fit was the best predictor of 
employee engagement.25 Other studies have found that the establishment of 
clear goals, presence of effective leadership, and opportunities for training 
and development enhance employee engagement. By their very nature, these 
kinds of qualitative variables are difficult to quantify and vary from person to 
person. Employee A may view company-sponsored attendance at an annual

professional conference as a satisfactory level of training and development 
opportunities, whereas Employee B may think this is inadequate.
We have a qualitative understanding of the linkages between internal pay 
equity and performance measures like productivity, employee retention, and 
overall company profits. To date, these relationships have not been quantified 
in such a way that one can definitively say that a 1% improvement in internal 
pay equity leads to an X% increase in productivity, a Y% increase in employee 
engagement, or a Z% reduction in employee turnover.26
Even though empirical literature is limited, there is a wealth of qualitative 
literature indicating that internal pay equity does provide businesses with a com-
petitive advantage in terms of attraction and retention of top talent, improved 
employee absenteeism rates, increased efficiency, employee performance, 
employee engagement, and enhanced organizational innovation. 
Gender Equity versus Overall Equity
Most of the current public discussion of internal pay equity focuses on the gen-
der pay gap and the frequently cited “77 cents” statistic: women earn, on aver-
age, 77 cents for every $1 earned by their male counterparts.27 Although race 
is sometimes mentioned in the current discussion, gender takes priority.28
Gender pay equity is an important part of internal pay equity. To fully lever-
age the competitive advantages provided, organizations must ensure that all 
employees are paid fairly, irrespective of sex, race, ethnicity, age, or other 
protected characteristic.
Why Gender Equity Is the Focus
Gender pay equity has become the centerpiece of the internal pay equity 
discussion for a variety of reasons. First, the entrance of women into the 
26This is a potential area for future research. It is likely, however, that the magnitude of 
these relationships will be sensitive to a variety of external factors (e.g., individual firm 
performance, the overall economic climate).
27As discussed in Chapter 9, the 77 cents statistic is a misleading comparison of average 
rates of pay by gender, because it does not consider differences by gender in factors such 
as occupation, industry, hours worked, compensation expectations and willingness to 
negotiate, and the role of personal choices.
28Differences in average pay rates by race are typically mentioned as a footnote to 
differences in average pay rates by gender (e.g., “women earn, on average, 77 cents for 
every dollar earned by their male counterparts, and the difference is even larger for 
women of color”).

labor force is one of the most significant socioeconomic changes in the past 
century. As noted by John Podesta:  
The Center for American Progress decided to closely examine the 
consequences of what we thought was a major tipping point in our nation’s 
social and economic history: the emergence of working women as primary 
breadwinners for millions of families at the same time that their presence 
on America’s payrolls grew to comprise fully half the nation’s workforce. . . . 
When we look back over the 20th century and try to understand what’s 
happened to workers and their families and the challenges they now face, 
the movement of women out of the home and into paid employment 
stands out as a unique and powerful transformation.29
In light of this, it should come as no surprise that gender has emerged as the 
centerpiece of the internal pay equity debate.
Additionally, the internal pay equity discussion focuses on gender because it is 
an argument that easily gains public support. Most (if not all) Americans would 
say that they support equal pay for women. Although we may disagree on 
how to achieve this—as well as how far away we are from achieving it—the 
goal itself garners nearly universal support.30 We embrace this goal because it 
appeals to our sense of distributional justice, and we are easily able to image 
how we would feel if our mother, our sister, or our daughter were paid less 
than her male counterpart simply because she is a woman. The argument for 
gender pay equity quickly resonates with our sense of fairness.
Furthermore, the vast majority of public discourse on internal pay equity has 
focused on gender.  A substantial body of scholarly and governmental research 
exists regarding women’s earnings, the gender pay gap, and barriers faced by 
women in the workplace with respect to compensation and career advance-
ment. Education and outreach programs by federal and state governments 
and regulatory agencies have historically framed internal pay equity in terms 
of the gender pay gap, and overall internal pay equity—that is, pay equity for all 
employees irrespective of gender, race, or other protected characteristic—has 
not been discussed. 
Because the public discourse has focused on gender pay equity, we have been 
conditioned to think of internal pay equity as a gender issue. We, as a culture,

automatically link internal pay equity to gender as the key characteristic and 
don’t really think about internal pay equity in broader terms. 
Why You Should Be Concerned About  
General Equity
Though there may be specific circumstances necessitating a review of inter-
nal pay equity with respect to women, racial minorities, and other common 
protected groups, as in the case of litigation and regulatory investigation, the 
strategic benefits and competitive advantages afforded by internal pay equity 
can only be realized through an examination of general pay equity. This means 
placing as much concern on the equity of white males as on women and racial 
minorities.31
There is no reason to expect that male employees or white employees are 
less sensitive to issues of distributive, procedural, interactional, or informa-
tional justice. The relationships between internal pay equity and performance, 
productivity, and engagement exist for male employees and white employees 
just as they do for female employees and nonwhite employees.
Failure to address internal pay equity issues with respect to male employees 
and white employees can create the same problems with respect to attracting 
and retaining top talent, turnover, and absenteeism.
The goal of this book is to provide readers with an understanding of how 
to examine internal pay equity with respect to all employees, irrespective of 
protected characteristics, so that the strategic and competitive advantages of 
compensating your employees fairly can be realized by all employers.
31It should be noted that white males are also protected by equal pay laws. The laws are 
written to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender or race and ethnicity and do not 
state that only women or racial minorities are covered under the laws. For example, if a 
man is paid less than a woman solely because he is a man, the employer could be found 
liable for gender discrimination. Similarly, if an employee is paid less because he is white, 
the employer could be found liable for race discrimination.

Types of 
Discrimination in 
Compensation
Under U.S. law, two main theories of discrimination are recognized by the 
courts. According to Ramona Paetzhold and Steven Willborn, these theories 
“reflect the two different conceptions of the behaviors and processes that 
produce discriminatory results.”1 One theory focuses on the intent of the 
decision maker; discrimination occurs when a decision maker acts with dis-
criminatory intent, known as disparate treatment. The other theory focuses on 
the policies and procedures used by the decision maker; discrimination occurs 
when a given policy or procedure has disproportionate effects on members of 
different groups, called disparate impact.  
Disparate Treatment
Disparate treatment is what we typically think of when we think about dis-
crimination. It occurs when a decision maker intentionally treats members 
of one group differently than those of another group. As defined by the U.S. 
Supreme Court, disparate treatment is discrimination in which “the employer

Chapter 2 | Types of Discrimination in Compensation 
simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their race, 
color, religion, sex or national origin.”2
Note
■
 Disparate treatment is a question of motivation. The intent of the decision maker is the 
central issue. An employer will be found liable for disparate treatment if it is determined that some 
employees were treated less favorably because of protected characteristics.
Within the compensation context, examples of disparate treatment include 
setting the pay rates for women lower than those for men simply because of 
gender, granting larger pay increases to whites and smaller pay increases to 
nonwhites because of race, or paying larger discretionary bonuses to younger 
individuals and smaller ones to older individuals because of age.
The Theory of Disparate Treatment
The key feature of a disparate treatment claim is the existence of discrimina-
tory intent.3 The definition of what constitutes discriminatory intent, however, 
has varying interpretations. As noted by Paetzhold and Willborn:
Although the precise content of the “intent” requirement is problematic, it 
is clear that a plaintiff need not prove actual, subjective animus against a 
protected group to present a successful disparate treatment case. Differential 
treatment designed to shield a protected group from harm, based on a 
rational assessment of true differences between groups, or caused by 
stereotypical or even subconscious attitudes may well lead to liability.4
The demonstration of discriminatory intent varies depending on the deci-
sions being challenged, the law(s) under which the lawsuit is filed, and the facts 
specific to each claim.5
Disparate treatment claims can be broken down into two basic variants: indi-
vidual claims and systemic claims. Individual disparate treatment occurs when 
an employer treats a person differently because of that person’s race, color, 
religion, sex, national origin, or age. Common examples of individual claims of 
2 International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. US, 431 U.S., 431 324 (1977). Race, color, 
religion, sex, and national origin are characteristics used to define protected groups.   
A protected group is a group of people who qualify for special protection by a law or 
policy. For example, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 affords protection based on sex.
3 As discussed later in this chapter, claims under the Equal Pay Act do not require the 
demonstration of discriminatory intent.
4 Paetzhold and Willborn, The Statistics of Discrimination, 3.
5 Demonstration of intent is discussed in a subsequent subsection.

21
disparate treatment include intentionally denying an employee over the age of 
forty a promotional opportunity because of his age, failing to consider a job 
applicant because of the candidate’s religious beliefs, or terminating a person 
because of her race.
Individual claims of disparate treatment center on the employer’s treatment 
of an individual employee and are the most common type of claim advanced 
in employment discrimination claims. Individual claims of disparate treatment 
may seem straightforward; however, proving such a claim can be very difficult, 
because the intent of the employer can easily be disguised. 
Systemic claims of disparate treatment center on the employer’s treatment 
of a group of individuals as a whole, rather than a specific individual. Common 
examples of systemic disparate treatment include denying promotional oppor-
tunities to all employees over the age of forty because of their age, failing to 
consider job applicants who hold a given religious belief, or paying women less 
than their male counterparts because of their gender.6
Stages of a Disparate Treatment Claim
Generally speaking, all claims of individual and systemic disparate treatment 
share three stages:7
1.	 The plaintiff has the burden for establishing a prima 
facie case raising an inference of discrimination;8
2.	 The burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a 
legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for its action;
3.	 The plaintiff must then prove that the employer’s artic-
ulated legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason is a 
pretext for discrimination.9
These three phases are illustrated using the Equal Pay Act, Title VII, the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act: 
the four federal laws under which pay discrimination claims can be brought.
6 These claims are sometimes referred to as pattern or practice claims.
7 This model was created by the U.S. Supreme Court and is typically referred to as the 
McDonnell Douglas Burden Shifting Formula named after the case in which it was first 
articulated: McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).
8Prima facie is literally translated as “on its face.” A plaintiff makes a prima facie case by 
presenting enough evidence to support a claim of discrimination unless contradictory 
evidence is presented.
9Pretext generally refers to a reason for an employment action that is false and offered to 
hide the true motives for the action.

Chapter 2 | Types of Discrimination in Compensation
22
The Prima Facie Case
The purpose of the prima facie case is to “eliminate the most obvious, lawful 
reasons for the defendant’s action.”10 In cases of compensation discrimination, 
the way(s) the plaintiff makes a prima facie case differ depending on the law(s) 
under which the claims are brought. The elements of prima facie cases under 
the Equal Pay Act are substantially different from those under Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act (Title VII), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 
and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
First, under the Equal Pay Act, the plaintiff is not required to demonstrate 
discriminatory intent. The plaintiff can recover damages simply by proving 
that she received lower pay for substantially equal work; no demonstration of 
discriminatory intent is required. In contrast, the demonstration of discrimina-
tory intent on the part of the employer is required until Title VII, the ADEA, 
and the ADA for recovery of damages by the plaintiff.11 
Note
■
■
  The Equal Pay Act creates a type of strict liability in that no intent to discriminate needs 
to be shown for the plaintiff to prevail on a claim of pay discrimination.
Second, under the Equal Pay Act, the plaintiff is required to prove the require-
ments of “substantially equal” work and “similar working conditions.” Claims 
of pay discrimination filed under Title VII, the ADEA, or the ADA do not require 
jobs to be “substantially equal.”12
The Prima Facie Case under the Equal Pay Act
As articulated in Corning Glass Works v. Brennan (417 U.S., 94 S. Ct. 2223, 1974), 
“to state a claim for relief under the Equal Pay Act, plaintiff must establish a 
prima facie case of wage discrimination by showing that the employer pays dif-
ferent wages to employees of the opposite sex for substantially equal work.”
The first step is to establish that the employer did in fact pay different wages 
to employees of the opposite sex. Here, wages include all types of compensa-
tion, including but not limited to regular and overtime pay, bonuses, expense 
accounts, vacation and paid leave, holiday pay, shift differentials, premium pay 
for weekends and/or holidays, gasoline allowances, and so on.

After establishing differences in compensation by gender, it must be shown 
that these differences relate to “substantially equal” work. Identical work is 
not required under the Equal Pay Act (EPA). In determining whether work is 
“substantially equal” job content—not job title—is examined. Specifically, the 
following characteristics of the job are examined:13
Skill
• 
: measured by factors such as ability, education, train-
ing and experience required to perform the job. The issue is 
what skills are required for the job, not what skills individual 
employees have. For example, two bookkeeping jobs could be 
considered equal under the EPA even if one of the job holders 
has a master’s degree in physics since that degree would not 
be required for the job.
Effort
• 
: the amount of physical or mental exertion required to 
perform the job. For example, suppose that men and women 
work side by side on a line assembling machine parts. The 
person at the end of the line must also lift the assembled 
product as he or she completes the work and place it on a 
board. That job requires more effort than the other assembly 
line jobs if the extra effort of lifting the assembled product 
off the line is substantial and is a regular part of the job. As 
a result, it would not be a violation to pay that person more, 
regardless of whether the job is held by a man or a woman.
Responsibility
• 
: the degree of accountability required to per-
form the job. For example, a salesperson who is delegated the 
duty of determining whether to accept customers’ personal 
checks has more responsibility than other salespeople. On the 
other hand, a minor difference in responsibility, such as turning 
out the lights at the end of the day, would not justify a pay 
differential. 
Working conditions
• 
: the physical surroundings, such as  
temperatures, fumes and ventilation, and hazards.
Establishment
• 
: an establishment is a distinct physical place of 
business, not an entire business or enterprise consisting of sev-
eral places of business. In some circumstances, physically sep-
arate places of business may be treated as one establishment. 
For example, if a central administrative unit hires employees, 
sets their compensation, and assigns them to separate work 
locations, the separate work sites can be considered part of 
one establishment.

Chapter 2 | Types of Discrimination in Compensation
24
Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the 
defendant. There are a variety of “affirmative defenses” permitted under the 
Equal Pay Act, discussed in a subsequent section.
The Prima Facie Case under Title VII, ADEA, and ADA
Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA all prohibit compensation discrimination 
on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability. The 
requirements for establishing a prima facie case of compensation discrimina-
tion under these laws are less stringent than those under the Equal Pay Act. 
However, there is no requirement that the claimant’s job must be substantially 
equal to that of a higher-paid person outside of the claimant’s protected class. 
Furthermore, these laws do not require the claimant to work in the same 
establishment as a comparator. 
Generally speaking, to establish a prima facie case under Title VII, the ADEA, 
or the ADA, the plaintiff must show that he or she is a member of a protected 
class, the job he or she occupied was similar to higher-paying jobs occupied by 
members of the nonprotected class, and the employer acted with discrimina-
tory intent.14
There are several ways the plaintiff can demonstrate the employer acted with 
discriminatory intent. One way is through the introduction of direct evidence, 
which is evidence of discrimination that is so clear that no one would have to 
infer or imply any meaning. Examples of direct evidence include statements or 
documents from the employer that clearly demonstrate it has illegally consid-
ered protected class status in its decision making.
Direct evidence is rarely available; in most cases, plaintiffs produce circumstan-
tial evidence, from which discrimination can be inferred indirectly. Examples of 
indirect evidence include patterns of conduct, derogatory or discriminatory 
comments, or other evidence of differential treatment based on protected 
class status. Frequently, statistical analysis is introduced as indirect evidence 
of discrimination. 
Affirmative Defenses
Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of pay discrimination, the 
burden shifts to the defendant employer to articulate a legitimate and non-
discriminatory reason for its action. These reasons are often referred to as 
14 The nonprotected class is defined based on the plaintiff’s protected class. For example, 
if the plaintiff is alleging gender discrimination and is female, the nonprotected class is 
defined as males. If the plaintiff is alleging race discrimination and is African American, the 
nonprotected class will (in most cases) be defined as whites.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
25
“affirmative defenses.” There are a variety of affirmative defenses under the 
relevant laws.
The Equal Pay Act outlines four affirmative defenses available to employers:
No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section 
shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are 
employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to 
employees in such establishments at a rate less than the rate at which he 
pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishments for 
equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, 
and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working 
conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to 
(i) a seniority system, (ii) a merit system, (iii) a system which 
measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or (iv) 
a differential based on any other factor other than sex: provided, 
that an employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this 
subsection shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of this subsection, 
reduce the wage rate of any employee. (emphasis added)
The first defense argues that the difference in pay between the plaintiff and 
her male comparators is the result of a bona fide seniority system. To establish  
this, the employer must show that it uses a system that gives employees 
certain rights and benefits that improve or increase the longer they are 
employed by the employer. In general terms, bona fide seniority systems 
have rules that:
define when the seniority clock begins;
• 
specify when and under what circumstances an employee’s 
• 
seniority may be halted or lost;
define which time will count toward the accrual of seniority 
• 
and which time will not;
specify the types of employment conditions that will be 
• 
governed by seniority and those that will not.
For the employer to successfully demonstrate a bona fide seniority system, 
it must regularly consider seniority (rather than doing so randomly or on a 
case-by-case basis), and the seniority system must be applied uniformly in the 
decision-making process.
The second affirmative defense argues that the difference in pay between the 
plaintiff and her male comparators is the result of a bona fide merit system. To 
establish that a merit system exists, the employer must show an organized and 

Chapter 2 | Types of Discrimination in Compensation
26
structured procedure for systematically evaluating employees according to 
established standards designed to determine their relative merits. The criteria 
on which employees are systematically evaluated must be predetermined.15 In 
addition, there must be an organized means of advancement or reward for 
merit.16 For the merit system to be valid, the employer must inform employ-
ees of its existence (either in writing or some other manner) and the merit 
system must not be based on gender.
The third affirmative defense argues that the difference in pay between the 
plaintiff and her male comparators is the result of a bona fide system measur-
ing quantity or quality of production. The employer must show that such a 
system is in place and has been applied to compensation decisions regularly 
and consistently. For a system of this type of be valid, the employee’s earnings 
must be measured by the quantity or quality of production. 
The quantity test refers to equal dollar per unit compensation rates. The 
employer is not liable for pay discrimination if it has implemented a system in 
which two employees receive the same pay rate, but one receives more total 
compensation because he or she produces more.
The quality test refers to increased compensation for higher-quality products. 
The employer is not liable for pay discrimination if it regularly rewards male 
and female employees equally for producing higher-quality products through 
compensation incentives. 
The fourth and final affirmative defense argues that the difference in pay 
between the plaintiff and her male comparators is the result of any factor 
other than sex. Factors other than sex can include things like education, expe-
rience, licenses and certifications, and even market forces.17
15Ryduchowski v. Port Authority, 203 F.3d 135, 26 142-43 2nd Cir., 2000.
16EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 839 F.2d 302, 345-46 7th Cir., 1988.
17Some courts have held that market forces are not a “factor other than sex.” For example, 
in Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, the employer created a night shift inspector position 
at a time when New York and Pennsylvania prohibited female employees from working 
at night. To recruit and retain male employees for this position, the employer paid male 
night shift inspectors more than female day shift inspectors. The employer argued that 
the pay differential was not based on sex but on the company’s need to recruit and 
retain male night shift inspectors. The Supreme Court rejected this argument and found 
that the employer’s decision to pay women less for the same work men performed 
exploited market forces. The Court held that market forces cannot be—in this case—a 
“factor other than sex,” because sex is precisely the factor on which those market 
forces have been based. Other courts, however, have held that employers can consider 
market forces when determining the salaries of employees. The Seventh Circuit issued 
just such an opinion in Merillat v. Metal Spinners, Inc. (470 F.3d 685, 7th Cir. 2006) 
(although the Court did caution against employers taking advantage of market forces 
to justify discrimination).

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
27
The four affirmative defenses articulated in the Equal Pay Act are incorporated 
into Title VII through the Bennett Amendment.18 The purposes of the amend-
ment were to “resolve any potential conflicts between Title VII and the Equal 
Pay Act” and to clarify that “the standards of the Equal Pay Act would govern 
even those wage discrimination cases where only Title VII would otherwise 
apply.”19 In County of Washington v. Gunther, the Supreme Court interpreted 
the Bennett Amendment to not incorporate the Equal Pay Act’s “equal work” 
requirement in Title VII sex-based pay claims, but to subject such claims to the 
four affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act.20
Generally, the four affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act are also incorpo-
rated into the ADEA. As noted by Mack Player:
The ADEA has its legislative roots near those of Title VII of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964. Much of the operative, substantive language of the ADEA 
was drawn from that previously found in Title VII. Because of this similarity 
the courts have indicated that as a general proposition Title VII and ADEA 
litigation should follow a parallel course.21
It should be noted that under the ADEA, differentiation on the basis of age 
pursuant to bona fide benefit plans such as retirement, pension, or insurance 
is permitted.
Pretext
Once the defendant has articulated a legitimate and nondiscriminatory  
reason for its action, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to prove that the 
employer’s articulated legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext 
for discrimination.
The pretext stage of employment discrimination cases is “pivotal.”22 The plain-
tiff’s prima facie case has been established, and the defendant has offered 
legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. During the pretext stage, 
the plaintiff must demonstrate that the reasons offered by the defendant are a 
pretext, not the true reasons for the alleged discriminatory acts, and that the 
employer engaged in intentional discrimination. The finder of fact then makes

a decision as to the employer’s true motive(s) for the alleged discriminatory 
acts.23 
It should be noted that even if the plaintiff successfully proves that the employer’s 
defense is pretextual, a finding of unlawful discrimination is not mandatory. In 
St. Mary’s Honor Center v. Hicks, the Supreme Court held that in an employment 
discrimination case, the plaintiff is not automatically entitled to prevail even if 
he establishes a prima facie case of discrimination and demonstrates that all 
of the reasons advanced by the employer for the alleged discriminatory action 
are false. The finder of fact may still conclude that the employer’s action is not 
discriminatory.24
Use of Statistics in Disparate Treatment Claims
Statistical analysis is frequently used in claims of disparate treatment because 
of its relevance in creating an inference of discrimination. As noted by the 
Ninth Circuit in Lowe v. City of Monrovia: 
Statistical data is relevant because it can be used to establish a general 
discriminatory pattern . . . Such a discriminatory pattern is probative of 
motive and can therefore create an inference of discriminatory intent.25
Statistical analysis can be used to establish the claim of a pattern or practice of 
discrimination or to bolster circumstantial evidence of discrimination. Courts 
have held that statistical evidence demonstrating a pattern can substantiate 
the employer’s motive and can therefore create an inference of discriminatory 
intent.26
Plaintiffs routinely offer statistical analysis as indirect evidence of discrimina-
tion when making a prima facie case. As early as 1977, the Supreme Court 
held that gross statistical disparities can provide prima facie proof of discrimi-
nation.27 As noted by the Supreme Court in its decision in City of Richmond v. 
J.A. Croson Company: 
There is no doubt that where gross statistical disparities can be shown, 
they alone in a proper case may constitute prima facie proof of a pattern 
or practice of discrimination under Title VII.28

Within the context of compensation discrimination, plaintiffs typically offer 
statistical analysis in the form of a multiple regression to demonstrate the 
employer’s pattern or practice of discrimination and establish a prima facie 
case.
The use of statistical analysis as evidence of pretext was first recognized by 
the Supreme Court in 1978.29 Lower courts have followed suit in cases of 
individual and systemic disparate treatment. In Sweat v. Miller Brewing Company, 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held: 
Statistical information concerning an employer’s general policy and 
practice concerning minority employment may be relevant to a showing 
of pretext, even in a case alleging an individual instance of discrimination 
rather than a “pattern or practice” of discrimination.30
Defendant employers also frequently use statistical analysis to demonstrate 
affirmative defenses. It is not uncommon for defendants to present their own 
statistical analysis, often modifying the plaintiffs’ analyses to incorporate legiti-
mate, nondiscriminatory factors that have been omitted.
Identifying and Preventing Disparate Treatment
A statistical analysis of internal pay equity is the most effective way of identify-
ing disparate treatment in compensation. Reviewing compensation for inter-
nal equity with quantitative tools not only identifies potential problem areas 
but also provides the employer with an opportunity to correct them before 
formal charges of discrimination are filed and litigation commences. The spe-
cific form of statistical analysis chosen will depend on the type(s) of compen-
sation under examination and the nature of the question(s) being addressed. 
Various types of statistical analyses, including multiple regression analysis, are 
discussed in detail in later chapters. 
The possibility of disparate treatment in compensation cannot be completely 
eliminated. There are some actions that employers can take to minimize the 
likelihood of disparate treatment manifesting in compensation decisions.
First and foremost, it is important to have a specific set of criteria for mak-
ing compensation decisions. They should be based on a set of consistent 
and well-articulated factors. It should be clear to anyone reviewing the policy 
what factors and metrics are used when making compensation decisions. If  
these factors and metrics cannot easily be identified, the policy itself should 
be revisited. Compensation decisions should be based on tangible, measurable 
criteria; decisions should not be arbitrary or completely discretionary.

Chapter 2 | Types of Discrimination in Compensation
30
Managers and supervisors should be trained on compensation policies and 
how to use them in making compensation decisions. Employers should develop 
and implement audit procedures for ensuring that managers and supervisors 
comply with the policies when making pay decisions.
Specific attention should be paid to initial pay settings for newly hired employees.   
Those hired for positions with similar functions and responsibility levels, which 
require similar skills and qualifications, should be compensated similarly. Any 
disparities created by initial pay setting can compound over time, potentially 
leading to larger disparities in the future. A small differential in initial pay may 
seem innocuous, but it can develop into a substantial problem years down   
the road.
Disparate Impact
The second theory of discrimination, disparate impact, focuses on the cri-
teria used by decision makers. Unlike disparate treatment, the intent of the 
decision maker is irrelevant. In some respects, disparate impact is purely a 
statistical question. It occurs when a facially neutral policy or practice has a 
disproportionate effect on members of different groups of employees. Even if 
the employer is not motivated by discriminatory intent, disparate impact may 
still occur.
Note
■
 Disparate impact is a statistical question. The intent of the decision maker is irrelevant. 
Disparate impact claims boil down to a mathematical comparison of employment outcomes by 
protected group status. An employer can be found liable for disparate impact even if the decisions 
were not motivated by discriminatory intent.
Disparate impact is often used interchangeably with the term adverse impact. 
Formally, disparate impact is a legal theory of liability under Title VII. Adverse 
impact is one element of that theory; it measures the effect of an employment 
policy or practice on a class protected by Title VII.31
31 It should be noted that disparate impact can exist in contexts other than employment 
decisions. For example, disparate impact may exist in lending if the criteria used in a loan-
making process (e.g., mortgage) affect different groups differently. Common examples 
of the occurrence of disparate impact outside the employment context include jury 
selection, credit scores, housing, education, and political processes. The term adverse 
impact refers to disparate impact specifically within the employment context.

The Theory of Disparate Impact
The central issue in the disparate impact model is the challenged employ-
ment policy or practice. In general, a policy or practice will be found to have a 
disparate impact if that policy or practice (1) disproportionately screens out 
members of a protected group from employment opportunities or benefits, 
and (2) does not advance the employer’s legitimate business interests. 
A use of a facially neutral policy or practice having a disparate impact on 
members of a protected group is not automatically prohibited. Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act prohibits such policies and practices if they have an unjustified 
disparate impact. If an employer can demonstrate that the policy or practice is 
job-related and consistent with business necessity, then that policy or practice 
is permitted under Title VII.
For example, in Zamlen v. City of Cleveland, a group of women challenged a 
pre-employment test for firefighters as having a disparate impact by gender. 
According to the complaint, the test required the following:
While wearing a custom-tailored self-contained breathing apparatus, 
candidates must drag two lengths of standard 2 ½” hose 180 feet (90 feet 
one way, drop the coupling, run to the other end of the hose, pick up and 
return 90 feet, drop coupling in designated area), run 75 feet to pumper, 
remove a one-person ladder (approximately 35 pounds) from the side of 
the pumper, carry the ladder to the fire tower, place it against the back 
rail of the first landing and continue up the inside stairwell to the fifth floor 
where a monitor observes the candidate’s arrival. Then candidates return 
to the first landing, retrieve the ladder and place it on the pumper.32
None of the female candidates successfully completed this test. Despite the 
fact that it had a disparate impact on candidates by gender, the test was found 
to be lawful based on its direct relationship to firefighting.

  Disparate impact is not always illegal. If an employment policy or practice has an 
adverse impact, its use is not prohibited if the employer can establish its job-relatedness and 
business necessity.
It should be noted that an employer can be found liable for discrimination 
when any part of its selection process has a disparate impact, even if the final

32
result of the process is balanced with respect to protected group status. In 
Connecticut v. Teal, the Supreme Court rejected the “bottom-line defense”:
Despite petitioner’s nondiscriminatory “bottom line,” respondents’ claim of 
disparate impact from the examination, a pass-fail barrier to employment 
opportunity, states a prima facie case of employment discrimination under 
703(a)(2) of Title VII, which makes it an unlawful employment practice 
for an employer to “limit, segregate or classify his employees” in any way 
which would deprive “any individual of employment opportunities” because 
of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. To measure disparate impact 
only at the “bottom line” ignores the fact that Title VII guarantees these 
individual black respondents the opportunity to compete equally with 
white workers on the basis of job-related criteria. Respondents’ rights under 
703(a)(2) have been violated unless petitioners can demonstrate that the 
examination in question was not an artificial, arbitrary or unnecessary barrier 
but measured skills related to effective performance as a supervisor.33
Because of this, it is important to examine each step of a selection process 
for disparate impact. Employers should not assume that a nondiscriminatory 
bottom line result insulates them from claims of disparate impact.
Stages of a Disparate Impact Claim
Generally speaking, there are four stages of a disparate impact claim.
1.	 The plaintiff must isolate and identify the particular 
employment policy or practice creating the alleged 
disparate impact.
2.	 The plaintiff must demonstrate that the identified 
employment policy or practice has a disparate impact 
on a protected group.
3.	 Assuming that the plaintiff successfully demonstrates 
disparate impact, the defendant bears the responsi-
bility of demonstrating that the challenged policy or 
practice is job-related for the position in question and 
is consistent with business necessity.
4.	 Assuming that the defendant is able to demonstrate 
the job-relatedness and business necessity of the chal-
lenged employment policy or practice, the plaintiff 
must then show that there exists an alternative policy 
or practice that meets the defendant’s business inter-
ests but has a lesser impact on the protected group.
33Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 1982.

33
To illustrate these four phases, we consider the seminal disparate impact case, 
Griggs v. Duke Power Company. In Griggs, Duke Power required employees to 
have a high school diploma to be eligible for transfer to desirable depart-
ments. The plaintiffs claimed that the educational requirement had an unjusti-
fied adverse impact on African American employees. Therefore, in the first 
phase of the claim, the plaintiffs identified the high school diploma require-
ment as the challenged employment practice.
The plaintiffs presented evidence that approximately 34% of white males in 
the geographic area where the plant was located had high school diplomas. In 
contrast, approximately 12% of black males in this same area had high school 
diplomas. Because of this difference, the plaintiffs were able to demonstrate 
that the high school diploma requirement had a disparate impact on blacks.
The employer was then required to demonstrate that the diploma requirement 
was job-related and consistent with business necessity, but was unable to dem-
onstrate this. The requirement of a high school diploma was adopted without a 
meaningful study of the relationship between the educational requirement and 
job duties. Additionally, there were employees without high school diplomas 
who were working in the desirable departments and performing successfully.
In its decision, the Supreme Court stated:
The [Civil Rights] Act proscribes not only overt discrimination, but also 
practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation. The touchstone 
is business necessity. If an employment practice which operates to exclude 
Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice 
is prohibited. On the record before us, neither the high school completion 
requirement nor the general intelligence test is shown to bear a demonstrable 
relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used. . . .
Congress directed the thrust of the Act to the consequences of employment 
practices, not simply the motivation. More than that, Congress has placed on 
the employer the burden of showing that any given requirement must have 
a manifest relationship to the employment in question. The facts of this case 
demonstrate the inadequacy of broad and general testing devices, as well as 
the infirmity of using diplomas or degrees as fixed measures of capability. . . .
Diplomas and tests are useful servants, but Congress has mandated the common 
sense proposition that they are not to become the masters of reality.34
Had the employer been able to demonstrate the job-relatedness and business 
necessity of the high school diploma requirement, the case would have moved 
into the fourth stage. The plaintiffs would have been required to demonstrate 
that there was an alternate process that met the employer’s requirement 
but with a lesser impact on the protected group. Few disparate impact cases 
reach the fourth and final stage.

Chapter 2 | Types of Discrimination in Compensation

Use of Statistics in Disparate Impact Claims
Statistical analysis is central to demonstrating the presence or absence of 
disparate impact. In its decision in Hazelwood School District v. United States, the 
Supreme Court held that a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of class hir-
ing discrimination by presenting statistical evidence comparing the racial com-
position of an employer’s workforce with that of the relevant labor market.35 
The central assumption of the statistical model of disparate impact is as fol-
lows. If the challenged employment policy or practice is neutral with respect 
to protected status, then the selection rates for the protected group and the 
nonprotected group should be equal. For example, if 20% of the nonprotected 
group is selected, we would expect that under a neutral selection process, 
20% of the protected group would be selected as well.
Another way of expressing this is with respect to the composition of the 
overall study population. For example, assume that we are interested in exam-
ining a prerequisite in the employer’s hiring process. Also assume that 30% 
of the candidates are protected and 70% of the candidates are nonprotected. 
If the prerequisite has no disparate impact, we would expect that 30% of the 
candidates satisfying the prerequisite would be protected and 70% would be 
nonprotected. That is, we would expect the percentage of protected candi-
dates satisfying the prerequisite to mirror the percentage of protected candi-
dates in the study population.
As can be seen from these two examples, the presence or absence of dispa-
rate impact is demonstrated using evidence relating to the protected group as 
a whole. Statistical analysis typically serves as this evidence. Statistical models 
and techniques for assessing the presence or absence of disparate impact are 
discussed in Chapter 6.
Disparate Impact in Compensation
Disparate impact is typically associated with policies and practices related to 
employee selection (e.g., candidate screening, hiring, promotion, termination). 
There are situations, however, where claims of disparate impact present them-
selves in the content of compensation decisions. One common presentation 
is in the context of a formula-based compensation system.36
35Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 1977.
36Formula-based compensation is a system in which compensation is mathematically 
calculated using a predetermined formula and various inputs, such as measures of 
employee production.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
35
Typically, formula-based compensation systems are protected under Section 
703(h) of Title VII:
It shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply 
different standards of compensation or different terms, conditions, or 
privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority or merit system, 
or a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production or 
to employees who work in different locations, provided that such differences 
are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race, color, 
religion, sex, or national origin.
Under this provision of Title VII, disparate impact alone is not enough to invali-
date a bona fide merit, seniority, or production-based compensation system.37 
Unless a plaintiff can prove that the compensation system was adopted with 
actual discriminatory purpose, it is immunized from violation of Title VII.38
There have been cases, however, in which plaintiffs have argued that a bonus 
program or other formulaic element of compensation was not protected 
under Title VII. Goodman v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. is one such case.
Goodman involved a transition “stay bonus” program that Merrill Lynch adopted in 
connection with a merger with the Bank of America. The program provided stay 
bonus payments only to Merrill Lynch’s most productive financial advisors. The 
amounts of the bonus payments were directly tied to advisors’ production.
The plaintiff made the following arguments:39
Protections in Title VII for production and merit-based 
• 
programs do not apply if production is infected with dis-
crimination (e.g., client leads that generate production 
are given to men but not to women).
Under the language of the statute, protections do not 
• 
apply if the compensation program is adopted with 
“intent to discriminate” and such intent on the part of 
the employer can be inferred if that employer adopts a  
 
 
37A bona fide compensation system has the following characteristics: (1) the system was 
adopted without discriminatory intent; (2) the system is an established system based on 
predetermined criteria for measuring seniority, merit, or productivity; (3) the system has 
been communicated to employees; and (4) the system has been consistently applied to 
all employees, irrespective of gender, race, national origin, and so on.
38Discriminatory purpose means more that “intent as volition or intent of awareness of 
consequences.” To violate Title VII, the compensation system must be selected or reaffirmed 
“at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’” its adverse impact on the protected class. 
See Accord Day v. Patabsco & Back Rivers R.R. Co., 504 F. Supp. 1301, 1310, D. Md., 1981.

program knowing there is underlying discrimination that 
infects the production on which the program is based.
In its decision, a court in the Southern District of New York held that:
A merit, seniority, or production-based compensation system is “bona fide” if 
it applies equally to all employees in the same way. Even if the compensation 
system perpetuates the effect of other acts of discrimination that clearly 
violate Title VII, as long as the compensation system itself was adopted without 
discriminatory intent, it is immunized under Section 703(h). To the extent that 
other acts of discrimination in violation of Title VII affects the “inputs” into a 
bona fide merit, seniority, or other production-based compensation system, a 
plaintiff’s remedy lies in challenging those other violations directly.40
The court also rejected plaintiff’s second argument, stating that “knowledge of 
past and even present discrimination alone does not make it plausible that defen-
dants actually adopted the [stay bonus program] with discriminatory intent.”41
Identifying and Preventing Disparate Impact
The concept of disparate impact has been around for approximately fifty 
years. Even though the idea is widely understood, employers are faced with 
hundreds of disparate impact lawsuits every year. A potential root cause of 
this is that employers take the wrong approach to managing the risk of dispa-
rate impact.
Employers have traditionally approached discrimination prevention with training. 
Recent estimates indicate that companies in the United States spend nearly 
$300 million annually on diversity training programs. Employees, managers, 
and supervisors spend countless hours in seminars and training events every 
year discussing conflict resolution, communication skills, and the importance 
of having a diverse and inclusive workplace.
The time and money spent on conventional training does not address  
disparate impact and is not effective at preventing this type of discrimination. 
Interpersonal skills and techniques addressed in conventional training are, in 
many respects, irrelevant to the issue of disparate impact. Disparate impact 
does not happen through personal interaction; it resides in the policies and 
practices of the organization. Nearly every decision an employer makes—in 
recruiting and hiring, compensation, promotion, discipline, and termination—
can be affected by disparate impact.

Co., Inc.,716 F. Supp. 2d (2010).

Disparate impact is less obvious than other forms of discrimination, and it 
does not manifest in the clear ways that intentional discrimination does. The 
only way to successfully manage the risk of disparate impact is with proactive 
examination of policies and practices with quantitative tools. If employers  
are not examining their policies and practices for disparate impact, they may 
be unaware that one of their policies or practices is creating disparate impact 
until they are faced with a lawsuit.42 
Note
■
■
  Disparate impact frequently hides in the employment policies and practices of an 
organization. Employers may not be aware that one of their policies or practices has a disparate 
impact until it’s too late and they are faced with litigation. The risk of disparate impact litigation can 
be minimized by conducting some basic statistical analyses with respect to equity.
Documentation also plays an important role in preventing and detecting 
disparate impact. With respect to formula-based compensation systems, 
documentation is critical for establishing that the system is bona fide. The  
criteria used in the compensation system (e.g., the basis for measuring seniority,  
merit, or productivity) and eligibility criteria for participation should be  
thoroughly documented. In addition, the business reasons for adopting the 
program should be clearly delineated in writing. The compensation program 
should be clearly and transparently communicated to employees in writing.  
Most important, once the formula-based system is in place, it should be applied 
consistently to all eligible employees without exception.

impact using quantitative tools, see Stephanie Thomas, Statistical Analysis of Adverse Impact: 
A Practitioner’s Guide (Authorhouse, 2011).

Multiple 
Regression 
Analysis
How do we examine compensation data for the presence or absence of 
discrimination?
The first thought that may come to mind is to look at average pay rates 
for different groups. Averages are easy to calculate and interpret, and most 
people have a basic intuitive understanding of what an average is and what it 
represents.
A comparison of simple average rates of pay, however, does not—and in fact 
cannot—account for legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors that employers 
consider when setting hourly rates of pay. Because of this, a simple compari-
son of average compensation, in most cases, cannot provide an appropriate 
assessment of the presence or absence of discrimination. To see this, consider 
the following example.
Assume that we are interested in examining hourly rates of pay for the 
presence or absence of gender discrimination among a group of employees. 
Further assume that an employee’s hourly rate of pay at the time of hire is 
set to $10, irrespective of gender, and that the initial hourly rate of pay has 
been fixed at $10 per hour for the past five years. Employees are given a $1 
per hour annual increase for every year of seniority with the company. Finally, 
assume that Table 3-1 represents pay, seniority, and gender data for the group 
of employees we are examining.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis

The average hourly rate of pay for men is $14.40,1 and the average hourly rate 
of pay for women is $11.40.2 A comparison of the average hourly rates of pay 
for men and women reveals a $3 per hour difference.3
Based solely on this comparison of average pay rates by gender, one may be 
tempted to infer that gender discrimination exists: women are paid, on average, 
$3 per hour less than their male counterparts. With no further information, 
one may infer that the reason for this difference is discrimination.
This analysis, however, fails to consider the role of seniority in an employee’s 
hourly rate of pay. We know that (1) an employee’s hourly rate of pay at the 
time of hire is set to $10, (2) the initial hourly rate of pay has been fixed at $10 
per hour for the past five years, and (3) employees are given a $1 per hour 
annual increase for every year of seniority with the company.
A simple comparison of the average hourly rates of pay for men and women 
does not consider how seniority influences pay. In fact, by definition, a simple 
comparison of average hourly rates of pay for men and women cannot consider 
any information other than hourly pay rate and gender.
When we consider information regarding how hourly rates of pay are determined, 
we see that the $3 per hour difference in average hourly rates of pay by gender 
is completely explained by differences in average seniority by gender. The average

seniority among male employees is 4.4 years,4 whereas the average seniority among 
female employees is 1.4 years.5 A comparison of the average years of seniority for 
men and women reveals a three-year difference in seniority.6
This three-year difference in seniority by gender explains the $3 difference 
in hourly pay rates. Based on the information regarding how hourly rates of 
pay are determined, along with data on seniority and hourly pay rates for this 
group of employees, we would expect a $3 per hour difference in pay between 
men and women if there was a three-year difference in seniority between men 
and women.
When we account for differences in seniority by gender in our examination 
of average hourly pay rates by gender, we see that the difference is perfectly 
explained by differences in seniority. We therefore would not conclude that 
pay discrimination exists.7
In this example, one way seniority would be accounted for or incorporated 
into the analysis of compensation is through the use of multiple regression 
analysis.
Correlation and Causality
In simple terms, multiple regression analysis is a statistical tool through which 
the relationship between a variable of interest and other variables that pro-
vide information about the variable of interest can be explored. In terms of 
the example given in Table 3-1, multiple regression analysis could be used to 
explore the relationship between the hourly pay rate (the variable of interest) 
and seniority and gender (the other variables that provide information about 
the variable of interest).8
4(5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 3) / 5 = 4.4 years.
5(3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0) / 5 = 1.4 years.
64.4 – 1.4 = 3 years.
7 Note that based on this analysis, there is no evidence of pay discrimination. The difference 
in average seniority by gender may be based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors, or it 
may be based on discrimination. For example, it may be the case that no qualified female 
applicants applied for employment with this employer until three years ago. This would be a 
legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the difference in average seniority by gender. It may 
also be the case that the employer refused to hire qualified female applicants before three 
years ago based on the gender of the applicant. This would be a discriminatory reason for 
differences in seniority. Although this may support a claim of hiring discrimination, this is a 
separate issue unrelated to the claim of compensation discrimination.
8 For simplicity in explanation, I focus on a two-variable model. The discussion will be 
expanded to a multivariable model later in this chapter.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis

Correlation
Multiple regression analysis is based on the concept of correlation. In simplest 
terms, correlation refers to whether—and how strongly—two variables are 
related. For example, there is a positive correlation between education and 
income; people with more years of education tend to have higher income 
­levels. As the number of years of education increases, income levels increase. 
A positive correlation is a relationship in which both variables move in the 
same direction (i.e., increases in one lead to increases in the other).
On the other hand, a negative correlation is a relationship in which the variables 
move in opposite directions. As one variable increases, the other decreases. 
An example of a negative correlation is the relationship between education 
and time spent in prison. As years of education increase, the number of years 
a person spends in jail decreases.
Examples of positive and negative correlations are shown graphically in 
Figures 3-1A and 3-1B.

Covariance is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables.  
The correlation coefficient is a scaled version of covariance and ranges  
from –1.0 to +1.0. A value of +1.0 indicates that the two variables are perfectly 
positively linearly related. A value of –1.0 indicates that the two variables are 
perfectly negatively linearly related. A value of 0.0 indicates that there is no 
linear relationship between the variables.
Correlation has two main shortcomings. First, it is limited to examining the 
relationship between two variables. In most cases related to compensation 
discrimination, it will be important to examine the interrelationships between 
more than just two variables. For example, correlation could not be used to 
examine the interrelationships between hourly pay rates, seniority, and gender 
described earlier.

Second, correlation can only identify whether a linear relationship exists 
between two variables, and if so, how strong the relationship is. It cannot tell 
us, for example, how much the hourly pay rate increases as a result of a one-
year increase in seniority. To examine the magnitudes of the interrelationships 
between multiple variables, a different technique is required.
Causality
It is important to note that although correlation implies a relationship between 
two variables, it does not imply causation. As noted by Ramona Paetzhold and 
Steven Willborn:
It would be inappropriate to interpret a large correlation between work 
experience and salary level as meaning that work experience leads to  
(i.e., causes) increased salary. Causation may work in the opposite direction, 
for example; large salaries may cause individuals to continue employment 
in the same profession or career longer, thereby producing greater work 
experience. Or, there may be no apparent causal relationship at all.9
One popular example of inappropriately inferring causality where only a 
­correlative relationship exists is the folk tale that babies are delivered by 
storks. When the number of breeding pairs of white storks is compared to 
the number of human births, there is a positive correlation between the two. 
Robert Matthews performed such an empirical study, and found a correlation 
of 
0.62
=
r
.10 He calculated that if there really was no relationship between 
stork populations and human birthrates, the likelihood of seeing this relation-
ship as a result of chance was 1 out of 125.11 He notes:
This does not imply that the probability that mere fluke really is the correct 
explanation is just 1 in 125; still less does it imply a 124/125 = 99.2% 
probability that storks really do deliver babies.12
If causality was attributed to this correlative relationship, we would infer that 
storks deliver babies. This would be an incorrect inference (and at odds with 
basic biology). In this example, the relationship between storks and babies can

be explained by the fact that the stork population and the human birthrate 
are both correlated with a third variable: weather patterns nine months prior 
to the observations.
Returning to the previous example of hourly rates of pay, seniority, and gender  
in Table 3-1, we can think of hourly pay rates as the human birthrate and 
gender as the stork population. There is a correlative relationship between 
gender and hourly rates of pay—women are paid, on average, $3 per hour less 
than their male counterparts. 
In this example, inferring that being female causes lower hourly rates of pay 
(i.e., gender discrimination) is incorrect; a relationship exists between gender 
and hourly rates of pay because both are correlated with seniority. In this 
example, seniority is the determinant of hourly wage rates.
The distinction between correlation and causality is critical when interpreting 
the results of a multiple regression analysis and making inferences regard-
ing the presence or absence of discrimination. I return to this point later in  
the chapter.
The Basics of Regression Analysis
Regression analysis is a tool for statistically describing the relationships 
between a variable of interest—typically referred to as the “dependent 
variable”—and other variables that provide information about the variable 
of interest, typically referred to as “independent variables” or “explanatory 
variables.”13 In general terms, regression analysis seeks to quantify the rela-
tionship between variations in the independent variables and variation in the 
dependent variable.
To demonstrate how regression analysis describes the relationships between 
dependent and independent variables, we return to the previous example of 
hourly pay rates, seniority, and gender. For ease of explanation, I initially will 
limit the discussion to a two-variable regression analysis, focusing only on the 
hourly rate of pay and seniority. The discussion will later be expanded to a 
three-variable analysis that examines the relationship between the hourly rate 
of pay, seniority, and gender.
13Paetzhold and Willborn argue that the phrase “independent variable” is misleading, 
because the explanatory variables are not independent of the dependent variable, and 
it is the relationship between the dependent and explanatory variables that is being 
examined (The Statistics of Discrimination, p. 267). However, the dependent variable/
independent variable nomenclature is commonly used in statistics and social sciences 
and is therefore presented herein.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis

Two-Variable Analysis
To statistically describe the relationship between the hourly rate of pay and 
seniority, we need a data set that contains a number of observations i  for each 
variable. Returning to Table 3-1, we see that this data set contains hourly pay 
rates and seniority for ten employees (i.e., ten observations). Therefore, we 
can use this data set as the basis for our analysis. 
We also need a hypothesis that sets forth the mathematical relationship 
between the hourly pay rate and seniority. We can take as our initial hypoth-
esis the relationship between hourly rates of pay and seniority articulated by 
the employer in this example: an employee’s hourly rate of pay at the time of 
hire is set to $10, irrespective of gender, and employees are given a $1 per 
hour annual increase for every year of seniority with the company.
We can graph the data set given in Table 3-1 using a scatter plot to visually 
examine the relationship between the hourly rate of pay and seniority. This 
scatter plot is shown in Figure 3-2.

Figure 3-2.  Hourly pay rate and seniority
As can be seen from Figure 3-2, there is a perfectly positively correlated linear 
relationship between the hourly rate of pay and seniority: as years of seniority 
increase, the hourly rate of pay increases. This is consistent with the relation-
ship between hourly pay rates and seniority articulated by the employer.

Assuming a linear relationship between the hourly rate of pay and seniority, 
we can express this relationship mathematically as follows:14

equation takes the following form.15

$1
(

∗
	
(3.3)
The intercept of the equation (where the regression line crosses the vertical 
axis) is $10. In other words, the hourly pay rate for a newly hired employee 
with 0 years of seniority is $10. This coincides with the company’s stated 
starting pay rate of $10 per hour.
The slope of the line is 1: a one-unit change in years of seniority is associ-
ated with a one-unit change in pay. This also coincides with the company’s 
stated $1 per hour annual increase for every additional year of seniority with 
the company. This mathematical relationship between hourly pay rates and 
seniority is expressed graphically as a straight line in Figure 3-3.16 
14It is possible, and under some circumstances likely, that a nonlinear relationship exists 
between variables. Nonlinear relationships between variables are discussed in a 
subsequent section of this chapter. The estimation of nonlinear models is beyond the 
scope of the current discussion.
15Readers familiar with the mathematical formula for a straight line (y
mX
β
=
+ ) will 
recognize the similarity between this equation and the one describing the relationship 
between hourly rates of pay and seniority.
16A linear relationship between two or more variables will be expressed as a straight line. 
Nonlinear relationships can take various curvilinear forms and are beyond the scope of 
the current discussion.

As can be seen from Figure 3-3, the line describing the relationship between 
hourly rates of pay and years of seniority given in Equation 3.3 fits the data 
points perfectly; the line passes through the center of each data point. This is 
attributable to the fact that the correlation coefficient for hourly rates of pay 
and seniority is 1.0; there is perfect correlation.
Rarely in real life do we see such a perfect relationship between two variables. 
More often than not, it will not be possible to draw a straight line through a 
set of data points that perfectly connects all points. In these cases, the task at 
hand is to find a line that best describes the data points.
For example, assume that we are interested in exploring the relationship 
between the annual salary and time in job data given in Table 3-2.

Figure 3-4. Annual salary and time in job
Based on a review of the information in Table 3-2 and Figure 3-4, we see that 
there is a positive, although not perfect, correlation between annual salary 
and time in job. Generally speaking, higher annual salaries are associated with 
more time in job. The calculated correlation coefficient for annual salary and 
time in job is 0.862.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis

Unlike the previous example, where all of the observations of hourly rate of 
pay and seniority fell on a straight line, we cannot draw a straight line through 
the centers of all of the data points for annual salary and time in job because 
the correlation is not perfect (i.e., it is not equal to 1.0).
In cases of less than perfect correlation, the task then becomes finding a line 
that best describes the relationship between annual salary and time in job. There 
are hundreds of different lines that could be drawn through these data points.
As shown in Figure 3-5, one option would be to draw a line through the highest 
and lowest combinations of annual salary and time in job (Employees 422 and 
464, respectively).

Alternatively, we could draw a line through those data points with an annual 
salary of $30,000 (Employees 510, 461, and 463), as shown in Figure 3-5.
Unfortunately, neither of these lines shown in Figure 3-5 best describe the 
data set. Drawing a line through the highest and lowest combinations of 
annual ­salary and time in job (Employees 422 and 464, respectively) ignores 
the majority of data points, which would fall below this line.
Similarly, drawing a line through those data points with an annual salary  
of $30,000 (Employees 510, 461, and 463) ignores the trend line of the data  
(a positive correlation demonstrated by the clustering of data points from 
lower left to upper right).

Finding the line that best describes the data can be found using a calculation 
known as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis. OLS is a math-
ematical calculation that finds the “line of best fit” that “minimizes the sum 
of the squared deviations from the points on the graph to the points of the 
straight line (with distances measured vertically).”17 This least squares crite-
rion can be expressed mathematically as follows:

Mathematically, the line of best fit can be described as follows:
	
$7,000
(7,833.30
)
annual salary
time in job
=
+
∗
	
(3.7)
This equation can be interpreted as follows. The intercept of the equation  
is $7,000, meaning that annual salary for an individual with 0 years of time in 
job is $7,000. The slope of the line is 7,833.30, meaning that an additional one 
year of time in job leads to a $7,833.30 increase in annual salary.
Three-Variable Analysis
Although the two-variable analysis is useful for illustrative purposes, it is insuf-
ficient for describing the way in which real-world compensation decisions are 
typically made. Rarely, if ever, is compensation determined by only one factor. 
In most cases, a variety of factors are considered. These factors may include 
measures of seniority or time in job, employee performance ratings, educa-
tion, prior relevant labor market experience, and so forth.

To statistically describe the relationship between compensation and the 
­various factors that determine it, it is necessary to construct a model that 
represents as closely as possible the actual decision-making process used by 
the employer.18 Because multiple factors are typically considered when making 
compensation decisions, the two-variable analysis is insufficient; the analysis 
must be extended to the multivariate framework.
To see how the two-variable analysis extends to the multivariate framework, 
we begin with a three-variable analysis. Assume that we are interested in 
examining the relationship between annual salary, time in job, and gender. 
Further assume a data set containing this information for eight employees,  
as shown in Table 3-3.

20In statistical language, these coefficients are referred to as “beta one hat,” “beta two hat,” 
and “alpha hat.” The “hat”—or accent mark over the coefficient—is used to indicate 
that the coefficient is estimated, and not necessarily the true parameter of the study 
population. The true parameters are expressed without the hat.

The interpretation of the three-variable model is similar to that of the  
two-variable model, with the exception of an important caveat regarding the 
slope coefficients. The estimated slope coefficient 
1ˆb  expresses the change  
in salary as a result of a one-unit change in time in job, all other things held 
constant.21 The estimated slope coefficient 
2ˆb  expresses the change in salary 
as a result of being female (as opposed to being male), all other things held 
constant. From a gender pay equity perspective, this result would imply that 
among males and females with identical time in job, women earn $3,100 less 
than their male counterparts.22
The three-variable analysis is a special form of the classical linear regression 
model in that it limits the analysis to only three variables: one dependent 
­variable and two independent variables. The general form of the classical 
­linear regression model can include four or more variables: one dependent 
variable and three or more independent variables.
The Classical Linear Regression Model
The general form of the classical linear regression model expresses the  
relationship between the dependent variable (Y) and k independent variables 
(X’s) is as follows:

not consider whether the difference is statistically significant or “meaningful” from a 
statistical perspective. Interpretation of regression results are discussed in detail in a 
subsequent section.

Assumptions of the Classical Linear  
Regression Model 
The classical linear regression model given by Equation 3.13 is based on a 
set of five assumptions regarding the dependent variable, the independent 
variables, and the error term of the model. These assumptions are given in 
Table 3-5.
23Note that matrix form is printed in bold to distinguish it from non-matrix form.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis
58
As will be discussed, violations of any of these assumptions can result in  
serious problems ranging from errors in estimated coefficient values and 
incorrect inferences regarding the relationships among variables, to simply 
not being able to execute the mathematical calculations required to perform 
the multiple regression analysis.
Violating Assumption 1: Misspecification
The first assumption of the classical linear regression model is that the  
dependent variable can be calculated as a linear function of the independent 
variables and an error term, given by Equation 3.13. This assumption can be 
violated in one of three ways:
1.	 The specified set of independent variables omits  
relevant variables or includes irrelevant variables.
2.	 The parameters associated with the independent  
variables do not remain constant.
3.	 The relationship between the dependent variable and 
independent variables is nonlinear.
Collectively, these three violations of assumption 1 are referred to as 
misspecification. 
Omitted and/or Irrelevant Variables
In constructing a model of compensation, the goal is to build a model that 
approximates the actual compensation decision-making process as closely as 
possible. The model should include all factors considered by the decision maker 
Table 3-5. Assumptions of the Classical Linear Regression Model
1.
The dependent variable can be calculated as a linear function of a specific set of 
independent variables and an error term, as given in Equation 3.13.
2.
The error term has zero expected value for all observations.
3.
Errors have constant variance for all observations and are not correlated.
4.
No exact linear relationship exists between two or more independent variables.
5.
The independent variables are nonstochastic (i.e., can be considered fixed in  
repeated sampling).

when arriving at an employee’s specific compensation amount.24 Furthermore, 
the model should be limited to only those factors that enter into the decision-
making process; it should not contain irrelevant variables.
Omitted Variables
To see how omitting variables can impact the results of the regression analysis, 
consider the following example. Assume that for a given group of employees, 
compensation is determined based on a combination of factors as shown  
in Table 3-6. 
24It should be noted that the law does not require all relevant explanatory variables to be 
included in the model. Rather, as stated in Bazemore v. Friday: “failure to include variables 
will affect the analysis’ probativeness, not its admissibility” (Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S.

• Degree of technical skills
Responsibility: 30%
• Scope of control

• Degree of problem solving
The relationship between compensation and education, technical skills, scope 
of control, and degree of problem solving can be mathematically expressed 
as follows:

Assume, however, that educational attainment is omitted from the model and 
we estimate the relationship between the rest of the variables.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis
60
Because an important explanatory variable (educational attainment) has been 
omitted, the results of the estimation suffer from omitted variable bias.25 
Simply put, the model will compensate for the missing explanatory variable 
by under- or overestimating one of the other factors. Omitted variable bias 
creates bias in the estimated parameters.26 In other words, the estimated 
parameter values differ from the true parameter values because of this bias.
For example, it could be the case that the relationship between compensation 
and degree of problem solving is overestimated, meaning that our estimate of 
4
b  is measuring not only the relationship between compensation and degree of 
problem solving but also the relationship between compensation and ­educational 
attainment. This distorts the picture of the true relationship between compen-
sation and degree of problem solving and can lead to incorrect inferences about 
the direction, magnitude, and strength of the relationship between compensa-
tion and degree of problem solving.
There are two sources of omitted variable bias: (1) choosing the wrong model; 
and (2) the required variable is not measurable or is not contained in the 
data set. To avoid omitted variable bias stemming from choosing the wrong 
model, it is imperative to consider how the compensation decisions are made. 
As previously noted, the model should approximate the actual compensation 
decision-making process as closely as possible.
The model should include all factors considered by the decision maker when 
arriving at an employee’s specific compensation amount. Furthermore, the model 
should be limited to only those factors that enter into the decision-making  
process; it should not contain irrelevant variables. Building a model that incor-
porates all of the factors considered in the decision-making process reduces the 
risk of parameter estimates being infected by omitted variable bias.
Dealing with omitted variable bias attributable to a required variable’s inability 
to be measured or failure to be included in the data set will be discussed in 
detail in Chapter 4.
Inclusion of Irrelevant Variables
Because of omitted variable bias, one may be tempted to include as many 
variables as possible in the model.27 However, inclusion of irrelevant variables 
poses its own set of problems for multiple regression analysis.
25Omitted variable bias has been described by some as “the biggest problem in 
econometrics.” See, for example, Charlie Gibbons, Lecture on “Omitted Variable Bias,” 
University of Berkeley, October 18, 2009.
26There are different kinds of bias. Omitted variable bias is just one kind.
27This is sometimes referred to as the “kitchen sink” approach, because everything 
possible—including the kitchen sink—is included in the model.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
61
Returning to the previous example given in Table 3-6, assume that we include 
educational attainment, degree of technical skill, scope of control, and degree 
of problem solving as independent variables in our model. Further assume 
that we include the number of times during the year the employee wore a 
blue shirt to work, even though it has no relation to how compensation deci-
sions are made. I refer to this as the “blue shirt” model.
Unlike omitted variables, the inclusion of an irrelevant variable does not cause 
bias in the estimated parameters. Instead, the inclusion of an irrelevant vari-
able causes the estimated parameters to have a greater variance than they 
would in the “appropriate” model (i.e., the model that does not include the 
irrelevant variables). 
This becomes particularly important when evaluating the statistical signifi-
cance of the estimated parameters. In the blue shirt model, the estimates of 
the relationships between educational attainment, degree of technical skill, 
scope of control, degree of problem solving, and compensation will have 
greater variance. In simple terms, this greater variance causes us to be less 
sure—from a statistical perspective—about these relationships. This greater 
uncertainty may cause us to infer, based on the results of our analysis, that the 
relationship between educational attainment, for example, and compensation 
is not meaningful from a statistical perspective. Inclusion of irrelevant variables 
leads to greater uncertainty and less statistical power, which can lead to infer-
ences that are at odds with the true relationship between the dependent and 
independent variables.
Structural Change
The previous discussion has focused on examples in which the effects of the 
independent variables on the dependent variable are the same, irrespective 
of the particular values of the variables. There are cases, however, where the 
effects of the independent variables are different for different values of the 
variables. 
For example, assume that an employee’s hourly rate of pay at the time of hire 
is set to $10. Further assume that employees are given a $1 per hour increase 
for every year of seniority with the company for the first five years, and a $2 
per hour increase for every year of seniority after five years. Finally, assume 
that Table 3-7 represents hourly pay rate and seniority data for the group of 
employees we are examining.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis
62
In this example, the impact of seniority on an employee’s hourly rate of pay 
depends on that person’s seniority. Longer-tenured employees receive a larger 
hourly increase than shorter-tenured employees. The impact of seniority on 
hourly pay rates is not constant across all values of seniority. 
This can clearly be seen in Figure 3-8; when hourly pay rates and years of 
seniority are plotted against one another, we can graphically see that the 
slope of the dotted line connecting the data points changes at five years of 
seniority.

If the model of compensation ignored the fact that the company granted 
$1 per hour increases for employees with five years of seniority or less and 
$2 per hour increases for employees with six or more years of seniority, 
the regression estimate would be given by the solid line in Figure 3-8. In this 
example, the intercept (i.e., the hourly pay rate for new hires) is underesti-
mated, and hourly rates of pay are both under- and overestimated, depending 
on the number of years of seniority. This presents a significant problem when 
using regression analysis to examine internal pay equity.28
A model that incorporated information about the differentiation between 
“five years or less of seniority” and “six or more years of seniority” would do 
a better job of describing the actual compensation process. There are various 
ways to incorporate this information into the model; these techniques are 
discussed in subsequent chapters.

develop “predicted” pay rates and internal equity is assessed on the basis of the difference 
between “predicted” and actual rates of pay. This is discussed in detail in Chapter 5.

Nonlinear Models
The previous examples have all assumed that the relationship between the 
dependent variable and the independent variables can be expressed as a  
linear function (i.e., models that take the form of Equation 3.13). There are 
many examples, however, of nonlinear relationships between a dependent 
variable and independent variables. In some cases, a nonlinear relationship 
can be transformed into a linear relationship.29 In other cases, it is not pos-
sible to transform the relationship from a nonlinear form into a linear form. 
These cases are said to be inherently nonlinear. Equation 3.19 is an example 
of an inherently nonlinear relationship between a dependent variable and k 
independent variables:

Within the compensation realm, inherently nonlinear relationships are rare.  
If a nonlinear relationship exists, it is likely that it can be transformed into a 
linear relationship. For example, consider the nonlinear relationship between 
the dependent variable Y and an independent variable X shown in Figure 3-9. 
One can clearly see that when the two variables are plotted against each 
other, the data points take on the shape of a curve.

The relationship between X and Y has been transformed from nonlinear to

regression analysis.
As with other specification errors, using linear regression analysis to  
estimate a nonlinear relationship can lead to incorrect inferences regarding the  
relationships between the dependent variable and the independent variables.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis
66
Violating Assumption 2: Nonzero Error
The second assumption of the classical linear regression model is that the 
error term has zero expected value for all observations. In simple terms, this 
assumption means that all of the variables in the regression model have been 
measured accurately and without error.30 In practice, however, measurement 
errors do occur. These errors can occur in either the measurement of the 
dependent variable or in the measurement of the independent variables.
Errors in Measurement of Dependent Variable
Within the context of compensation analysis, the dependent variable will be 
some measure of compensation: hourly pay rates, annual salary amounts, over-
time earnings, incentive pay, etc. If the dependent variable is measured with error, 
it is still possible to estimate the relationships between the dependent and inde-
pendent variables. The estimated parameters associated with the independent 
variables will be unaffected as long as the measurement error in the dependent 
variable is unrelated to the independent variables. In the unlikely event that the 
measurement error in the dependent variable is correlated with one or more of 
the independent variables, the estimated parameters will be affected, which could 
lead to incorrect inferences about the true relationships being investigated.
Errors in Measurement of Independent Variables
Errors in the measurement of independent variables are more common than 
errors in the measurement of the dependent variable and, unfortunately, are 
less benign.31 If an independent variable suffers from measurement error, the 
estimated parameters in the model will be biased and will not reflect the true 
parameter values.
To see why this occurs, consider Equation 3.13. The classical linear regression 
model expresses the dependent variable as a function of a series of indepen-
dent variables and an error term (denoted bye). If one of the independent 
variables is measured with error, that error is “mixed” with the error term of 
the original model. This creates a compound error term. The problem is that 
this compound error term is correlated with the independent variable that 
30It should be noted that measurement error differs from data error. Measurement error 
is systemic in that all observations of a given variable are impacted. A simple example 
of measurement error is weighing a group of individuals using a scale that is incorrectly 
calibrated. The measurement of each person’s weight is impacted by the incorrect 
calibration of the scale. Data errors, on the other hand, are not systemic; they are random 
in the sense that they affect some observations but don’t affect others.
31Potential sources of measurement error in independent variables are discussed in detail 
in Chapter 4.

67
was measured with error. Because of this correlation, the estimated parame-
ters are biased and do not reflect the true relationships between the depen-
dent and independent variables. This can lead to incorrect inferences about 
the relationships being examined.
There are some statistical techniques for dealing with measurement error in 
an independent variable. The most commonly used technique is instrumental 
variables estimation. In simple terms, this technique substitutes a different 
variable Z for the independent variable X that was measured with error. This 
different variable Z should be highly correlated with the independent variable 
it is replacing, should not be measured with error, and should be uncorrelated 
with the error term of the original model.
It should be noted that it may be difficult or perhaps impossible to find a new 
variable Z that satisfies the required conditions just outlined. Furthermore, 
even if a new variable Z is found and the instrumental variables estimation 
technique is used, it is possible that the estimation process will generate 
biased parameter estimates.
Violating Assumption 3: Nonspherical Disturbances
The third assumption of the classical linear regression model is that the errors 
have constant variance for all observations and are not correlated. Violation 
of this assumption can occur in two ways: nonconstant variance across obser-
vations (referred to as heteroscedasticity) and correlated errors (referred to as 
serial correlation). As with other violations of the assumptions of the general 
linear model, the presence of heteroscedasticity or serial correlation poses 
problems for estimation and the interpretation of results.
Heteroscedasticity
If a data set has unequal variance across observations, it is said to be heterosce-
dastic.32 To see what is meant by unequal variance across observations, consider 
the following example. Imagine we are interested in examining the relationship 
between family income and expenditures.33 We would expect low-income fami-
lies to have steady expenditure rates. Because income is ­limited, these families 
are likely to budget their money carefully and spend the same amount each 
month on rent, utilities, food, entertainment, and so on. On the other hand, we 
would expect high-income families to have more variability in their ­expenditure 
32A data set is said to be homoscedastic if it has constant variance across all observations.
33This example was studied in detail by S. Prais and H. Houthkker, The Analysis of Family 
Budgets (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1955).

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis
68
rates. Because these families have more discretionary income (i.e., they have 
more money left over after purchasing essentials like food and shelter) their 
total expenditures are likely to vary from month to month. Some months this 
discretionary income may be saved, some months a portion may be saved and a 
portion spent, and in other months it may be spent completely. 
If we were to build a model of expenditures as a function of family income, 
we would see that error variances of high-income families are greater than 
the error variances of low-income families. Because of the greater variability 
in expenditures of high-income families relative to low-income families, our 
model would suffer from heteroscedasticity.
There are various formal statistical tests for heteroscedasticity.34 Often differ-
ences in error variances across observations can be seen visually. Figures 3-11A 
and 3-11B show homoscedastic and heteroscedastic data sets, respectively. As 
can be seen in Figure 3-11A, if we were to draw a straight line through the 
data points, they would be basically clustered around that line. The differences 
between the straight line and the data points would generally be the same size 
across all observations of X.
Figure 3-11A.  Homoscedastic data set (image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)
34The Goldfield-Quandt test (S. Goldfield and R. Quandt, “Some Tests for Homoscedasticity,” 
Journal of the American Statistical Society 60, [1965], 539–47) and the Breusch-Pagan test 
(T. Breusch and A. Pagan, “A Simple Test for Heteroscedasticity and Random Coefficient 
Variation,” Econometrica 47 [1979], 1287–94) are two of the commonly used tests.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
69
Figure 3-11B.  Heteroscedastic data set (image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)
On the other hand, Figure 3-11B illustrates a heteroscedastic data set. If we 
were to draw a straight line through the data points, they would be relatively 
close to that line for small values of X and would spread out farther away from 
the line for larger values of X. The data points essentially form a “cone” shape 
around the straight line.
Note that the data shown in Figure 3-11B make up only one example of a 
heteroscedastic data set. It is also possible for smaller values of X to have 
larger variances and larger values of X to have smaller variances. In this case, 
the cone shape observed in Figure 3-11B would be upside-down.
Heteroscedasticity is more common in cross-sectional data sets than in time-
series data sets.35 Within the context of reviewing compensation for internal 
pay equity, the presence of heteroscedasticity may present itself depending on 
the type of pay structure (e.g., broadband structures), the type of compensa-
tion being examined (e.g., incentive pay), and the way in which similarly situ-
ated employee groupings have been defined.36 
35A cross-sectional data set contains observations at a given point in time across a sample of 
things. An example of a cross-section data set would be hourly pay rates as of December 31, 
2013, for all employees in a specific job title. A time-series data set is one that contains 
observations across time for a given thing. An example of a time-series data set would be 
John Smith’s annual earnings for the years 1999 to 2013.
36Similarly situated employee groupings are discussed in detail in Chapter 4.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis
70
If heteroscedasticity is present, the regression estimation procedure places 
more weight on observations with large error variances than on those with 
small error variances. This weighting occurs because the estimation proce-
dure is minimizing the sum of squared errors (see Equation 3.4), and the sum 
of squared errors for large error variances is likely to be substantially larger 
than those of small error variances. Minimizing the sum of squared errors can 
best be accomplished by ensuring a very good fit in the large variance portion 
of the data.
Left uncorrected, heteroscedasticity creates greater variance in the estimated 
parameters. This increased variance causes greater uncertainty and less sta-
tistical power, which can lead to inferences that are at odds with the true 
relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
Autocorrelation
Autocorrelation37 occurs when the error term of one observation is corre-
lated with the error terms for other observations. To see how autocorrelation 
presents itself, consider the following example. Imagine that we are forecasting 
the growth of stock dividends over time. An overestimate of growth in one 
time period is likely to lead to overestimates of growth in later time periods. 
Similarly, an underestimate of growth in one time period is likely to lead to 
underestimates of growth in later time periods. This is an example of positive 
autocorrelation. The “direction” of the error (either over- or underestima-
tion) carries forward into future time periods.
Although less common, negative autocorrelation can also occur. Negative 
autocorrelation occurs when an underestimate in one period leads to over-
estimates in future periods, or when an overestimate in one period leads to 
underestimates in future periods. The direction of the error (over- or under-
estimation) changes in future time periods.
Examples of positive and negative autocorrelation are given in Figures 3-12A 
and 3-12B.
37Autocorrelation is sometimes referred to as serial correlation.

Autocorrelation is more common in time-series data sets than in cross-sectional 
data sets.38 There are a variety of statistical tests to detect the presence of auto-
correlation; the Durbin-Watson test is the most commonly used test.39
If left uncorrected, autocorrelation can create errors in estimation. To visually 
see how this happens, consider Figures 3-13A and 3-13B, which depict posi-
tive autocorrelation.

38As noted by Pindyk and Rubinfeld, “positive serial correlation frequently occurs in time 
series studies either because of correlation in the measurement error component of 
the error term or, more likely, because of the high degree of correlation over time 
that is present in the cumulative effects of omitted variables.” Pindyck and Rubinfeld,

In Figure 3-13A, the solid line represents the true relationship between X and Y, 
and the dotted line represents the estimated relationship between X and Y. 
The error term of the first observation is positive. Because of autocorrela-
tion, this leads to a series of correlated error terms; the first five are positive 
and the last two are negative. As can be seen, the intercept of the estimated 
regression line is greater than the true intercept, and the slope of the esti-
mated regression line is less than the true slope.
In Figure 3-13B, again the solid line represents the true relationship between 
X and Y, and the dotted line represents the estimated relationship between 
X and Y. The error term of the first observation is negative. Because of auto-
correlation, this leads to a series of correlated error terms; the first four are 
negative and the last three are positive. As can be seen, the intercept of the 
estimated regression line is smaller than the true intercept, and the slope of 
the estimated regression line is greater than the true slope.
In Figures 3-13A and 3-13B, the estimated regression line fits the data points 
better than the true regression line. This leads to the conclusion that the 
parameter estimates are more precise than they really are. This, in turn, can 
lead to incorrect inferences about the true relationships between the depen-
dent and independent variables. We are more likely to conclude that a strong 
relationship exists, when in fact that may not be the case.

Violating Assumption 4: Multicollinearity
The fourth assumption of the classical linear regression model is that no exact 
linear relationship exists between two or more independent variables. If there 
is a perfectly linear relationship between two or more independent variables, 
this assumption is violated.40
If there is a perfectly linear relationship between two or more independent 
variables, it is mathematically impossible to calculate the parameter estimates. 
The ordinary least squares solutions cannot be calculated. As noted by Peter 
Kennedy, “the estimating procedure simply breaks down for mathematical rea-
sons, just as if someone tried to divide by zero.”41
Rarely does a perfectly linear relationship between independent variables exist; 
usually it only occurs in data sets that have been artificially constructed. It is 
common, however, to have an approximate linear relationship between inde-
pendent variables (or combinations of independent variables). The existence 
of this type of approximate linear relationship is referred to multicollinearity.
Multicollinearity can make it difficult to know the true values of the coef-
ficients being estimated. When two or more independent variables are cor-
related (even if not perfectly), they move together. Thus, any variation in one 
of the independent variables is mirrored by variation in the correlated inde-
pendent variable(s). Because of this, there is very little variation that is unique 
to any of the correlated independent variables.
Remember that the parameters generated by regression express how changes 
in one independent variable affect the dependent variable while all other inde-
pendent variables are held constant. In the case of multicollinearity, it is difficult 
to hold all other independent variables constant because some are correlated 
with the independent variable under investigation. This makes it difficult to 
determine which of the independent variables “deserves the credit” for the 
jointly explained variation in the dependent variable. 
Essentially, multicollinearity causes coefficients to be estimated using less 
information. Basing coefficient estimates on less information means that we 
are less certain of their true value, causing those parameter estimates to have 
a higher variance. This increased variance causes greater uncertainty and less 
statistical power, which can lead to inferences that are at odds with the true 
relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

Violating Assumption 5: Simultaneous Equations
The fifth assumption of the classical linear regression model is that the ­independent 
variables can be considered fixed in repeated sampling. In simple terms, this means 
that the independent variables are not determined simultaneously. Simultaneous 
equations frequently appear in applied business and economic modeling. The 
classic example of this in economics is the model of supply and demand. In this 
model, the price of the good or service is simultaneously determined by the 
interaction of buyers and sellers in the marketplace. The price has to be agreed 
on by both: the buyer has to agree to pay the price for the good or service, and 
the seller has to agree to accept the price as payment.
Within the context of examining compensation for internal equity, simultane-
ous equations rarely (if ever) present themselves. Typically, we are examining 
compensation data that have already occurred; employees have already been 
paid an hourly wage or annual salary, have received an incentive payment, and 
so on. Because we examine events that have already occurred, their values are 
known with certainty and do not change.42
Theoretically, it is possible to have compensation determined as a set of simul-
taneous equations. For our purposes, it is extremely rare and thus will not be 
discussed at length.43
Interpretation of Regression Results
Assuming that the model has been properly specified and any issues with 
­violations of the assumptions of the general linear regression model have 
been dealt with, the model is estimated. Estimation of the regression model 
involves the use of statistical software to calculate the estimated parameters 
as given in Equation 3.17.44
To illustrate the interpretation of regression results, assume that we are 
­interested in examining the relationship between annual salary, time in job, 
having a particular certification, and gender. We can mathematically express 
this relationship as follows:

42We know, for example, that John Smith and Bob Jones received bonus payments in 2012 
of $105,000 and $112,000, respectively. It does not matter whether we measure these 
bonus payments today, tomorrow, or one month from now; the amounts will not change. 
They are fixed because they have already occurred.

standard econometrics textbooks.

Depending on the software, the output generated will vary in appearance, 
but will contain standard information that allows for basic evaluation of the 
results. Figure 3-14 provides an example of what the regression output may 
look like when Equation 3.22 is estimated.
Figure 3-14.  Example regression output
From a practical perspective, there are five key aspects to consider when 
evaluating the results of a multiple regression analysis: the values of the esti-
mated coefficients, the statistical significance and practical significance of the 
estimated coefficients, the size of the sample, and the overall explanatory 
power of the model. 
Coefficients
As can be seen from Figure 3-14, the regression output shows the estimated 
values of all of the parameters. The estimate of the intercept term, 
0
b  (labeled 
as CONSTANT in the regression output) is $24,041.67. As noted previously, the 
intercept term is where the estimated regression line crosses the vertical axis.

77
The estimate of 
1,
b  the coefficient associated with time in job, is $1,241.45. As 
already mentioned, an estimated coefficient expresses the effect of a  
one-unit change in the independent variable on the dependent variable, all 
other factors held constant. The estimated value of 
1b expresses the addi-
tional amount of annual salary we would expect an employee to receive as a 
result of an additional year of time in job, ceteris paribus. In other words, if we 
have two employees of the same sex who both possess (or both do not pos-
sess) the particular certification, and one of those employees has one more 
year of time in job than the other employee, we would expect the annual 
compensation of the employee with the additional year of time in job to be 
$1,241.45 greater than that of the other employee.
The estimate of 
2,
b  the coefficient associated with possession of the particu-
lar certification, is $728.00. The estimated value of 
2
b  expresses the additional 
amount of annual salary we would expect an employee to receive as a result 
of having the particular certification, ceteris paribus. In other words, if we have 
two employees of the same gender with identical time in job, and one has the 
certification and the other does not, we would expect the annual compensa-
tion of the employee with the certification to be $728.00 greater than that of 
the other employee.
Our estimates of
0
1
,
b
b , and
2
b  all have positive signs, meaning that the effect 
of having more years of time in job or possessing the particular certification 
has a positive effect on compensation (e.g., more time in job leads to higher 
salary, possessing the certification leads to higher salary).
However, the estimate of
3
b  has a negative sign; the estimated coefficient is 
negative $7,158.33 (–$7,158.33). The estimated value of 
3
b  expresses the addi-
tional amount of annual salary we would expect an employee to receive as a 
result of being female, ceteris paribus. In other words, if we have two employ-
ees with identical time in job who both possess (or both do not possess) the 
particular certification, and one of those employees is male and the other 
employee is female, we would expect the annual compensation of the female 
to be $7,158.33 less than the male employee.45
45Note that in this example, our dummy variable for gender takes on a value of 1 for female 
and 0 for male. If this were reversed, and the dummy variable took on a value of 1 for 
male and 0 for female, the sign of the estimated coefficient would be positive, indicating 
the amount of additional annual salary an employee is expected to receive for being male, 
ceteris paribus. I return to this point in Chapter 4.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis
78
The sign of the estimated coefficient (positive or negative) indicates the direc-
tion of the relationship. In terms of examining internal pay equity with respect 
to gender, race and ethnicity, or other protected characteristic, the sign of the 
coefficient indicates whether there is an “advantage” or “penalty” (in terms 
of compensation) for being a particular gender, race or ethnicity, or other 
protected characteristic.
The magnitude of the estimated coefficient (e.g., $1,241.45) expresses the size 
of the effect. The magnitude of the estimated coefficients plays an important 
role in assessing regression results for practical significance, which is discussed 
in a subsequent subsection.
Statistical Significance
Though examination of the sign and magnitude of the estimated coefficients 
is important, the coefficients alone cannot tell us whether the observed rela-
tionship is meaningful from a statistical perspective. The estimated coefficients 
must also be examined for statistical significance.
In simple terms, statistical significance addresses the question of whether an 
observed outcome is “sufficiently rare” such that it is unlikely to occur due to 
chance variation.46
Formally, when we evaluate the estimated coefficients for statistical signifi-
cance, we conduct the following hypothesis test:
	
0
:
:
0
i
null hypothesis H
=
b
	
(3.23)
	
:
:
0
A
i
alternate hypothesis H
≠
b
	
The null hypothesis states that the true value of the estimated coefficient is 
equal to 0, meaning that there is no relationship between the independent 
variable and the dependent variable. If the null hypothesis is true, then any 
observed relationship between the independent and dependent variables is 
not because of a true underlying relationship but is attributable to random 
chance variation.
The alternate hypothesis states that the true value of the estimated coef-
ficient is not equal to 0, meaning that there is a relationship between the 
independent variable and the dependent variable. Thus, the observed rela-
tionship between the independent and dependent variables is not attributable 
to chance variation. 
46Readers who are unfamiliar with the basic concept of statistical significance are referred 
to the Appendix.

79
Within the regression analysis context, the formal statistical test for rejecting 
null hypotheses associated with estimated coefficients is typically based on the 
t-distribution.47 The test statistic is calculated as: 
	
ˆ
ˆ
(
)
i
i
t
se
=
b
b
	
(3.24)
If the calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical value (
ct ), we reject the 
null hypothesis; if the calculated t-statistic is less than the critical value, we 
cannot reject the null hypothesis. As noted by Pindyck and Rubinfeld:
Since 
ct  = 1.96 for large samples and a 5 percent significance level, a 
frequent rule of thumb is that a t value with a magnitude of 2 or larger 
allows us to reject the null hypothesis.48
Returning to the example regression output shown in Figure 3-14, the calcu-
lated t-statistics associated with each of the independent variables are shown 
in the column labeled “t.” For example, the calculated t-statistic associated 
with the estimated coefficient for time in job is equal to 6.208. Because this 
value is greater in magnitude than the critical value of 2, we would reject the 
null hypothesis and infer that a nonzero relationship exists between annual 
salary and time in job. Because we have rejected the null hypothesis, we would 
conclude that this result is “statistically significant.”
The calculated t-statistic associated with the estimated coefficient for pos-
session of a particular certification is equal to 0.985. Because this value is not 
greater in magnitude than the critical value of 2, we cannot reject the null 
hypothesis that there is no relationship between annual salary and possession 
of a particular certification. We have not rejected the null hypothesis, so we 
would conclude that this result is “statistically insignificant” or “not statistically 
significant.” 
In addition to the t-statistic, most statistical software also provides additional 
information in the form of a p-value. In Figure  3-14, p-values are given in 
the last column. The p-value shows the exact level of significance associated 
with an estimated coefficient. For example, the p-value associated with the 
estimated coefficient for time in job is equal to 0.001. This means that the 
observed result is statistically significant at the 0.1% significance level.
47The t-distribution is relevant because a sample estimate of the error variance, rather than 
the true error variance, is used for this statistical test. Pindyck and Rubinfeld, Econometric 
Models and Economic Forecasts, 67.
48Ibid., 68.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis

The level of significance is best understood in the context of what errors are 
possible when performing hypothesis tests. There are two kinds of errors one 
can make when performing hypothesis tests:
Type I error: incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis
• 
Type II error: incorrectly accepting a false null hypothesis
• 
The level of significance refers to the probability of making a Type I error. 
There is always a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. The probability 
of making a Type I error cannot be reduced without increasing the probability 
of making a Type II error and vice versa. The generally accepted level of signifi-
cance within the statistical and social sciences communities is 5% (p = 0.05). 
This definition has also been adopted by the courts.49
There is one critical point to keep in mind regarding statistical significance 
when reviewing regression results. If an estimated coefficient is not statisti-
cally significant, it is not statistically different from 0. In Figure 3-14, the esti-
mated coefficient associated with possession of a particular certification is 
$728.00. However, because this coefficient is not statistically significant, it is 
not statistically different from zero (i.e., we cannot reject the null hypothesis 
that its true value is 0). From a statistical perspective, we cannot infer that a 
relationship exists between annual salary and possession of this certification. 
This has particular importance for evaluating the protected group effects on 
compensation. If an estimated effect is not statistically significant, no adverse 
inference can or should be drawn regarding compensation discrimination.
Practical Significance
Statistical significance addresses the question of whether a true relationship 
between the independent variable and the dependent variable exists. Practical 
significance addresses the question of whether the relationship between the 
independent variable and the dependent variable is “big enough to matter.” As 
noted by Paetzhold and Willborn: 
Some coefficients can be statistically significant but not practically different 
from zero. A sex coefficient of –$25 could, in some situations, represent a 
statistically significant salary shortfall for women. Depending on absolute 
wage levels, however, the amount may be so small as to be practically 
negligible.50
49Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299 (1977).
50Paetzhold and Willborn, The Statistics of Discrimination, 280.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
81
On the other hand, estimated coefficients can be statistically insignificant but 
practically different from 0. According to Paetzhold and Willborn:
The coefficient of a predictor variable may not be statistically significant, yet 
the predictor may play an important role in the employer’s determination 
of compensation.51
The U.S. Supreme Court also addressed the issue of practical significance. In the 
same decision that established the legal threshold of statistical significance, the   
Court stated that gross statistical disparities could, by themselves, constitute 
prima facie proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination.52
Unlike statistical significance, there is no critical value for determining whether 
an estimated coefficient is practically significant. Practical significance is a ques-
tion of judgment.53
Sample Size
Sample size refers to the number of observations being examined in the analy-
sis. Sample size is commonly denoted as N. Referring back to the example 
regression output given in Figure 3-14, the sample size is reported in the 
second line of output (N = 78). When evaluating the results of a regression 
analysis, it is important to consider sample size because it can directly influ-
ence the outcome of statistical analyses. In fact, sample size plays an important 
role in statistical significance.
When testing the hypothesis that the true value of an estimated parameter is 
0 (as given in Equation 3.23), we cannot reject the null hypothesis if the result 
is statistically insignificant. As discussed, one reason for failing to reject the 
null hypothesis is that the null hypothesis is true (i.e., there is no relationship 
between the dependent and independent variables). 
It is also possible, however, that we fail to reject the null hypothesis because 
even though it is false, the data set used in the analysis is consistent with the 
null hypothesis. The statistical concept of power—the probability of rejecting 
the null hypothesis when it is in fact false—is important in understanding this 
explanation.54
51Ibid., 281.
52Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299 (1977).
53The issue of practical significance is discussed in more detail in Chapter 10.
54 The power of a hypothesis test is calculated as (1

probability that the null hypothesis will be accepted as true when it is in fact false.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis
82
The power of a test is a function of both the size of the effect that has been 
­measured and the size of the data set (the sample size). Generally speaking, a 
larger measured effect and a larger sample size will lead to a more powerful test. 
As noted by Pindyck and Rubinfeld:
When a statistical analysis with relatively low power fails to show a 
significant p-value, one should not automatically conclude definitively that 
there is no effect. Rather, one must allow for the fact that the study may 
be inconclusive because the data set is not sufficient to allow one to 
distinguish between the null and alternative hypotheses.55
Sample size can directly influence the outcome of a statistical analysis. If an 
analysis involves a small sample size, it is not uncommon to get a statistically 
insignificant result simply because there is not enough information and the 
statistical test lacks power. When evaluating the results of a statistical analysis, 
consideration should be given to how the sample size affects the power of the 
tests and what role it plays in accepting or rejecting the null hypotheses.
Explanatory Power
When assessing the results of a multiple regression analysis, it is important to 
consider the estimated coefficients, their statistical and practical significance, 
and what role sample size plays in the results generated. It is also necessary 
to assess how well the model, as a whole, performs in terms of explanatory 
power. To see the importance of evaluating overall explanatory power, con-
sider the following example.
Assume that compensation is determined by time in job and possession of 
a particular certification, and we are interested in assessing whether gen-
der plays any role in compensation decision making. Instead of estimating the 
model given in Equation 3.22, we estimate the model given in Equation 3.25, 
in which annual salary is a function of seniority, educational attainment, and 
gender:

83
When one compares the results shown in Figure 3-15 to those shown in 
Figure  3-14, it may appear as though there are no substantial differences. 
Coefficient estimates were generated for all of the variables, three of the four 
variables are statistically significant, the gender coefficient is negative and sta-
tistically significant, and so on.
However, the models differ markedly in their overall explanatory power. The 
model given by Equation 3.22 does a much better job of explaining the varia-
tion in annual salary than the model in Equation 3.25. This is evidenced by the 
R squared (
2
R ) statistics for the two models.
In essence, the R squared statistic (also referred to as the coefficient of deter-
mination) measures the proportion of variability in the dependent variable 
that is explained by the independent variables. R squared ranges in value from 
0.0 to 1.0; a value of 0.0 implies that none of the variation in the dependent 
variable is explained by the independent variables, whereas a value of 1.0 
implies that all of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the 
independent variables.
There are two variants of the coefficient of determination: R squared and 
adjusted R squared (
2
R ). Adjusted R squared adjusts for the number of inde-
pendent variables in the model, and R squared does not.56 Because of this, 
adjusted R squared is preferred to R squared.
Returning to the example regression output, we see that the adjusted R 
squared in Figure 3-14 (associated with the model in which compensation is a 
function of time in job, possession of the particular certification, and gender) 
Figure 3-15.  Example regression output
56R squared will automatically increase when an additional independent variable is added 
to the model. Unlike R squared, adjusted R squared only increases if the additional 
independent variable improves the model more than would be expected by chance.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis
84
is equal to 0.924. This means that 92.4% of the variation in annual salary is 
explained by time in job, possession of the particular certification, and gen-
der, after adjusting for the number of independent variables. The adjusted R 
squared in Figure 3-15 (associated with the model in which compensation is a 
function of seniority, educational attainment, and gender) is 0.421. This means 
that 42.1% of the variation in annual salary is explained by seniority, educa-
tional attainment, and gender, after adjusting for the number of independent 
variables. Comparing these two models in terms of adjusted R squared, we see 
that the model given in Equation 3.22 has far greater explanatory power than 
the one in Equation 3.25. 
Examining the explanatory power of a regression model is an essential piece 
of reviewing and interpreting analysis results. However, caution should be 
exercised in how much weight is placed on R squared measures. As noted by 
Paetzhold and Willborn:
An
2
R  value of 0.8 indicates that a relatively substantial amount of 
variability in compensation has been explained by the predictors; a much 
smaller value of 
2
R , however, can still indicate that the equation usefully 
explains variation in compensation level. 
2
R  measures explanatory power 
relative to a model containing no predictors. Thus, an 
2
R  value of even .4 
can indicate substantial explanation of compensation relative to a model 
having no predictors.57
Furthermore, R squared measures do not provide any information about how 
well the model describes the data set. This can only be addressed with an 
analysis of the regression residuals.58
Inferences of Discrimination
The results generated by a multiple regression analysis of compensation can 
be used to draw inferences about the presence or absence of discrimination. 
To demonstrate how these inferences are made, we return to the example 
model of compensation in Equation 3.22 and the associated regression results 
shown in Figure 3-14.

Assuming that none of the assumptions of the classical linear regression model 
have been violated, a review of the regression results indicates the following:
1.	 The sample size is sufficient (N = 78) such that our 
statistical tests have adequate power.
2.	 A review of the adjusted R squared measure indicates 
that 92.4% of the variation in annual salary is explained 
by time in job, possession of the particular certifica-
tion, and gender.
3.	 The estimated coefficient associated with the 
gender variable (i.e., the additional amount of 
annual salary we would expect an employee to 
receive as a result of being female, ceteris paribus)  
is –$7,158.33. This implies that there is a “penalty” for 
being female in terms of annual salary.
4.	 The estimated coefficient associated with the gender 
variable is statistically significant, meaning we reject 
the null hypothesis that there is no true relationship 
between gender and compensation.
5.	 The estimated coefficient associated with the gender 
variable is also large enough (in dollars) to be consid-
ered practically significant.
Based on these results, what can we say about the presence or absence of 
gender discrimination?
We can infer that the results of the analysis are consistent with the hypothesis 
of gender discrimination in compensation. We cannot conclusively establish, 
however, that gender discrimination is taking place. These results do not prove 
discrimination. The distinction between inferring the presence or absence 
of discrimination and proving discrimination may appear to be a matter of 
nuance; the distinction, however, is actually quite substantial.
Despite our best efforts, no model of compensation can be 100% accurate 
in describing how compensation is determined. No matter how diligently the 
model was constructed, there is the possibility that some explanatory fac-
tor has been omitted. As noted by Paetzhold and Willborn, “no statistical 
model of an organization’s compensation levels can be entirely accurate in 
representing how those compensation levels are determined.”59 Because of 
this, the possibility of misspecification cannot be completely and permanently 
eliminated.
59Paetzhold and Willborn, The Statistics of Discrimination, 281.

Chapter 3 | Multiple Regression Analysis
86
When interpreting regression results, it is important to keep in mind that a 
coefficient can only be interpreted within the context of the full model. In 
our example, we can conclude that when time in job and possession of the 
particular certification are accounted for, females are paid $7,158.33 less on 
average than their male counterparts. Any interpretation of an individual coef-
ficient must consider the other explanatory factors that are controlled for in 
the model.
Regression results cannot be interpreted in a causal manner. The fact that 
the relationship between compensation and gender is statistically significant 
does not mean that gender has a causal effect on compensation. Interpreting 
this relationship in such as manner (i.e., “gender causes compensation”) is 
akin to interpreting the relationship between stork populations and birthrates 
as causal (i.e. “storks cause babies”). We simply cannot conclude that being 
female causes an employee to earn $7,158.33 less per year.
Finally, the nature of statistics themselves should be kept in mind when inter-
preting results. The results express the likelihood of certain outcomes, not 
whether certain outcomes can or will occur. For example, if we flip a coin ten 
times, the likelihood of getting ten heads is 1 out of 1,000. Getting ten heads 
in ten flips is a pretty rare occurrence, but it does happen. In fact, we would 
expect it to happen once out of every 1,000 sets of flips. Although the likeli-
hood of seeing a $7,158.33 difference in compensation by gender as a result 
of chance may be small, it is not zero and it is possible.
Tools for Performing Multiple Regression
Multiple regression analysis is, with rare exception, performed using some 
type of statistical software package. Although the calculations involved are 
mathematically relatively simple, they are too complex to be carried out by 
hand. All of the calculations discussed in this chapter are standard features of 
commercially available statistical software packages.
A variety of software packages exist; some of the commonly used packages 
include EViews, Gauss, SAS, SPSS, STATA, and SYSTAT. Open-source alterna-
tives to commercial packages include PSPP and R. Microsoft Excel also has 
some basic statistical functionality.60
There are numerous advantages of using statistical software to perform mul-
tiple regression analysis. The required calculations and algorithms are built 
into the software. Very large data sets can be manipulated and analyzed with

relative ease. Scripts and programs can be written within the software so 
that model specifications and estimation routines can be saved for future use, 
applied to modified data sets, and so on.
The ease of use of statistical software can also be a drawback. Given that most 
packages have a graphical user interface, statistical tests can be performed in 
a “point and click” manner by selecting specific tests from drop-down menus. 
Specific knowledge of which test variants are appropriate and well suited 
for the data set and the questions being addressed is required to generate 
meaningful and reliable results. If a statistical software package is used without 
underlying statistical expertise, disastrous results can ensue. If inappropriate 
test variants and estimation procedures are chosen and/or results are inter-
preted incorrectly, any inferences drawn from those analyses cannot—and 
should not—be used to make business decisions.

The Data
On two occasions I have been asked, “Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into 
the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?” . . . I am 
not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could 
provoke such a question.
—Charles Babbage
A good data set is the foundation of a successful statistical review of compensa-
tion. The old adage of “garbage in, garbage out” could not be more fitting. Any 
quantitative analysis is only as good as the underlying data set. Inaccuracies and 
inconsistencies in the data not only can render the analysis inaccurate and unreli-
able but can also lead to incorrect inferences regarding the relationships being 
investigated. If these incorrect inferences are applied to business decisions, an 
employer could unintentionally create the very situation it was trying to remedy.
The keys to an accurate and reliable analysis encompass a clear understanding 
of what you are measuring, what relationships will be explored, and a thor-
ough review of the data for completeness, accuracy, and consistency.
The purpose of this chapter is to discuss some common data points used in 
compensation analyses and potential pitfalls with respect to typical data error 
issues. This discussion is not intended to be exhaustive of all potential data 
points that could be used in compensation reviews, nor is it an encyclopedia 
of all possible data errors.
Before turning to a discussion of the data points, a discussion of grouping 
employees for comparison purposes is warranted.
Similarly Situated Employee Groupings
For any statistical examination of compensation to generate meaningful 
results, it is important that each employee’s compensation is assessed against

may seem like an easy task—we simply put everyone in a particular job title 
into the same grouping, or we put all employees in a given cost center or 
department into the same grouping. In most cases, however, it is not as simple 
as this. To see why, consider the following example.
Assume that we are interested in examining the annual salaries of a group of 
employees for the presence or absence of gender pay discrimination. Further 
assume that the group of employees to be studied is defined as all who are 
assigned to the “headquarters” cost center, and these employees’ genders, job 
titles, and annual salaries are given in Table 4-1.

A simple comparison of average annual salaries by gender for this group of 
employees would indicate a difference of $192,000 in favor of males.1 Based 
on this difference, one may be tempted to make an inference of gender 
­discrimination. However, in this case the difference in average annual salaries 
by gender is explained by the fact that the group of employees being com-
pared against one another is improperly defined.
Irrespective of gender, one would expect that the annual salary of the CEO 
of an organization would be greater than that of a receptionist, administrative 
assistant, or executive assistant. The job duties and responsibilities of a CEO 
are very different from those of executive or administrative assistants and 
receptionists, as are the required skills and experience levels. The functions, 
responsibilities, and required skills corresponding to the job titles in Table 4-1 
are the following, according to the Occupational Outlook Handbook:2
1The average male compensation is $250,000; the average female compensation is $58,000. 
The difference between these figures is $192,000.

In the example shown in Table 4-1, the difference in average annual compen-
sation by gender is not attributable to sex discrimination; it is due to the fact 
that we have grouped employees inappropriately for comparison purposes. 
Although simplistic, this example illustrates that any inferences of discrimina-
tion (on the basis of sex, race and ethnicity, or other protected characteristic) 
can be inaccurate and quite misleading if the employee groupings have been 
incorrectly structured.
Generally speaking, only employees that are “similarly situated” should be 
grouped together for comparison purposes. There are no definitive rules for 
creating similarly situated employee groupings. However, the Office of Federal 
Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) proposes the following definition: 
groupings of employees who perform similar work and occupy positions with 
similar responsibility levels and involving similar skills and qualifications.3
3Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office of Federal Contract 
Compliance Programs, “Voluntary Guidelines for Self-Evaluation of Compensation Practices 
for Compliance with Nondiscrimination Requirements of Executive Order 11246 with 
Respect to Systemic Compensation Discrimination Notice, Part V,” Federal Register 71(116) 
(June 16, 2006): 35114.

 ﻿
92
The OFCCP notes that other “pertinent factors” should also be considered 
in the formulation of similarly situated employee groupings:
Otherwise similarly-situated employees may be paid differently for a variety 
of reasons: they work in different departments or other functional divisions 
of the organization with different budgets or different levels of importance 
to the business; they fall under different pay plans, such as team-based pay 
plans or incentive-based pay plans; they are paid on a different basis, such 
as hourly, salary or through sales commissions; some are covered by wage 
scales set through collective bargaining, while others are not; they have 
different employment statuses such as full-time or part-time.4
In addition to those specifically mentioned by the OFCCP, other factors may 
be considered pertinent to the formation of similarly situated employee 
groupings. For example, geography (or some other measure of location) may 
be considered a pertinent factor if locality adjustments or cost of living adjust-
ments are given to employees working in certain geographic locations, but not 
to those working in other locations.
In deciding whether employees really are similarly situated, it is useful to 
review job descriptions and what tasks are performed by the employees. It 
is also important to look at responsibility levels within the organization and 
chain-of-command issues, along with any general or specialized skills, abili-
ties, and qualifications that may be required for the positions in question. 
Interviews with managers and employees are also used to evaluate whether 
two positions are similarly situated. Ultimately, the similarity of work per-
formed, responsibility levels, and the required skills, abilities, and qualifications 
for the position remain a question of judgment.
Closely related to the concept of similarly situated employee groupings is the 
concept of comparators. Comparators are most often used within the com-
pliance review and litigation contexts. Assume, for example, that a Hispanic 
employee claimed that he received a smaller increase in pay because of race 
and ethnicity discrimination. To evaluate whether race and ethnicity played a 
role in the pay increases, one first must identify the claimant’s comparators: to 
whom is he similar? To whom should we compare his pay increase? 
The appropriate comparators in this case may be other employees in the 
same job title and pay grade with similar time in job and seniority. In identify-
ing the comparators, it would be important to know how pay increases were 
awarded in this case. If the increases were based on production, then one may 
want to limit the comparator set to only those individuals who had levels 
of production similar to that of the claimant. If the increases were based on 
4Ibid.

93
possessing a certain certification or qualification, then one may want to limit 
the comparator set to only those who possessed the same certifications and 
qualifications as the claimant.
Within a litigation context, comparators are often drawn from the major-
ity group. In this example, the Hispanic employee’s comparators would most 
likely be white. In cases where women claim they have been discriminated 
against on the basis of their sex, males are commonly taken as the appropriate 
comparators. From a pure equity perspective, however, there is no reason to 
limit the comparators to one particular sex, racial, or ethnic characteristic. 
From a pure equity perspective, it is important to know whether a particu-
lar white male is underpaid, for example, relative to other similarly situated 
white males. The demographics of the comparator set can differ based on the 
question(s) being addressed and what one hopes to learn from the analysis.
The way employees are grouped for comparison purposes is quite possibly the 
single most important aspect of any kind of workforce analytics. How employ-
ees are grouped can have a dramatic effect on the outcomes of the comparisons 
being made. Improperly grouped employees can render a comparison mean-
ingless. Furthermore, aside from the analytical implications, the way employee 
groups are constructed serve as a memorialization of the organization’s view 
of its workforce, and which employees are similar to one another. 
Compensation Metrics
Virtually any type of compensation paid to an employee can be examined 
with a statistical review. Base salaries, hourly pay rates, overtime earnings, 
bonuses, incentive pay, and total compensation are among the common  
measures studied.
Choosing the appropriate measure(s) of compensation for a given group of 
similarly situated employees is central to the analysis. The choice will be guided 
by two factors: the types of compensation earned by the particular group of 
employees, and the questions addressed in the compensation review.5
Different types of employees receive different types of compensation. 
Generally speaking, all employees receive some form of base pay. Some 
types of compensation are applicable only to certain groups of employees. It 
would be pointless, for example, to attempt to study overtime earnings for a 
5Because the employee groupings themselves influence the compensation metrics that can 
be studied, the construction of similarly situated employee groupings must precede any 
data collection efforts.

Chapter 4 | The Data ﻿
94
group of exempt employees.6 Similarly, it would not make sense to attempt 
to study commission earnings among a group of employees who do not earn 
commissions.
Many employees receive different types of compensation. For example, 
a salesperson may receive a base rate of pay (either an hourly rate or a salary 
amount), commissions on sales made, and bonuses for meeting specific sales 
targets or quotas. In this case, there are a variety of compensation metrics 
to choose from: base rates of pay, commissions, and bonuses. The choice of 
which compensation metrics to examine is determined by the questions being 
addressed. If overall equity is a concern, then total compensation (base earnings 
plus commissions plus bonuses) may be an appropriate choice. If the employer 
is investigating claims of discriminatory pay-setting practices, then the base rate 
of pay may be the appropriate choice.
Note
■
■
  There is no reason the same compensation metrics must be studied across similarly 
situated employee groupings. Different compensation metrics can be selected for different 
groupings of similarly situated employees.
Each element of compensation has its own peculiarities with respect to data 
capture and retention and its own set of unique governing influences that 
must be considered.
Base Pay
Base pay is perhaps the most commonly examined compensation metric. It is 
nearly universally received by all employees and is routinely maintained in an 
organization’s human resources and/or payroll databases.7 Reviewing base pay 
for internal equity is a natural starting point, because many other elements of 
compensation are tied to or dependent on base pay in some fashion.8
The most commonly encountered difficulty with respect to base pay data is 
reporting in inconsistent units. This primarily takes one of two forms: mixtures 
of hourly and annual rates and failure to account for full-time equivalency.
6This is, of course, because exempt employees do not receive overtime pay.
7In some circumstances, an employee may receive only commission-type earnings with no 
guaranteed base rate of pay.
8For example, overtime earnings are calculated at 1.5 times the regular rate of pay; the 
regular rate of pay, in turn, is based in large part on the hourly rate of pay. Bonuses may 
be determined as a percentage of annual salary.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
95
Depending on the human resources and payroll database software used by the 
organization, there is the potential for base pay to be recorded and maintained in 
inconsistent units for individuals within the same similarly situated employee 
grouping. In other words, base pay can possibly be captured in terms of an 
hourly rate for some employees and in terms of an annualized salary amount 
for others. This inconsistent reporting can create the appearance of problems 
in internal equity when in fact no such problem exists. For example, consider 
the compensation data shown in Table 4-2.

Hourly Amounts

If these pay data were used in a regression analysis, assuming the only dif-
ferences among these employees was gender, the analysis would indicate a 
statistically significant disparity in pay by gender. 
The problem, however, is not gender discrimination; the problem is that the 
pay of some employees is expressed in terms of an annual amount and the pay 
of others is expressed in terms of an hourly rate. Assuming that all employees 
in this similarly situated employee grouping are paid for 2,080 hours per year, 
their annual pay and hourly rates are exactly identical.9
A similar problem can manifest if a similarly situated employee grouping con-
tains a mixture of full-time and part-time employees. Assume, for example, 
that base pay is recorded in terms of an annual amount (hours multiplied by 
hourly pay rate) for a group of full-time and part-time employees, as shown 
in Table 4-3.
9$10 per hour multiplied by 2,080 hours per year is $20,800 per year. $20,800 per year 
divided by 2,080 hours per year is $10 per hour.

Chapter 4 | The Data ﻿
96
If these annual pay data were used in a regression analysis, assuming the only 
differences among these employees was gender, the analysis would indicate a 
statistically significant disparity in pay by gender. 
Again, the problem is not gender discrimination. The problem is that there 
is a mixture of full-time and part-time employees in this similarly situated 
employee grouping, and differences in the number of hours worked per week 
have not been incorporated. If compensation is expressed in terms of an 
hourly pay rate, we see that all employees are earning $10 per hour.10
In the example shown in Table 4-2, a visual inspection of the data is likely to 
reveal the inconsistency in the units of measure of pay. It is unrealistic (and most 
likely a violation of minimum wage laws) that an employee earns just $10 a year. 
The inconsistency in Table 4-3 is less likely to be revealed through visual inspec-
tion. All of the data points are plausible annual pay amounts, and the differences 
in values are not large enough to automatically trigger a red flag. Cases like 
those shown in Table 4-3 are not easily detected unless a review of full-time 
or part-time status, typical hours worked per week, and so on, are considered 
along with the annual pay. This makes these kinds of inconsistencies insidious 
because they can have a substantial impact on a review of internal pay equity 
but often remain undetected without a thorough review of the data.
Overtime Earnings
When studying overtime earnings for internal equity, there are two 
main issues that need to be considered. First, overtime earnings are 
directly related to the number of hours of overtime an employee works.

Among similarly situated employees, differences in overtime earnings by pro-
tected group status are typically explained by differences in overtime hours 
worked by protected group status.
Reasons for differences in overtime hours worked by protected group status 
are varied. For example, it may be the case that the number of overtime hours 
men choose to work is greater than the number of overtime hours women 
choose to work.11 It some circumstances, overtime opportunities are granted 
according to seniority.12 Any differences in seniority by protected group status 
may lead to differences in overtime hours worked by protected group status.
Generally speaking, because overtime earnings are dependent on overtime 
hours, examination of these earnings with respect to internal pay equity 
should include some measure of overtime hours worked.
Second, overtime earnings are determined—at least in part—by an employ-
ee’s hourly pay rate. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, most employees 
are entitled to receive time and one half the regular rate of pay for all hours 
worked over forty hours in a given work week.13 In some cases, an employee’s 
regular pay rate will be identical to the hourly rate of pay. In other cases, 
where an employee receives a shift differential, cost of living adjustments, dis-
cretionary bonuses, or other qualifying compensation, the regular rate of pay 
will be greater than the hourly rate of pay.
Generally speaking, the hourly rate of pay determines a substantial part of an 
employee’s regular rate of pay and, therefore, the overtime rate. If inequities 
in overtime earnings are discovered that are not accounted for by differences 
in overtime hours worked, these may be attributable to inequities in hourly 
rates of pay. In cases like these, an examination of hourly rates of pay for ineq-
uities should be included in the follow-up investigations.14
Variable Pay
Variable pay programs are gaining in popularity, and more organizations are 
using these programs to reward employees. Companies are increasingly 
relying on incentive and bonus payments, technical achievement awards, 
11There are varying reasons women may choose to work fewer overtime hours. Commonly 
cited reasons include child care and family responsibilities. This is discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 9.
12For example, if a limited number of overtime hours are available during a given time 
period, an employer may offer them to employees according to a seniority list, moving 
through the list until opportunities for the given period are exhausted.
13Section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act provides an exemption from overtime 
pay for certain types of employees.
14Follow-up investigations are detailed in Chapter 7.

and profit-sharing plans to minimize risks associated with fixed labor costs 
and to maximize return on investment. 
There is incredible variety among variable pay plans. Some types of variable 
pay—such as individual performance bonuses, commissions, or payments for 
skill and knowledge—are based on an employee’s performance. Other types 
of variable pay, such as work group bonuses, incorporate group-based perfor-
mance. Still other types of variable pay, such as profit sharing plans, are tied to 
overall organizational performance. In some cases, variable pay will be tied to 
an easily quantifiable metric, such as revenue generated, on-time completion 
of project milestones and deliverables, and attainment of profit goals. In other 
cases, variable pay may be based on more discretionary conditions, such as 
“exceptional performance.”
Because of this variety, examining variable pay for internal equity can be chal-
lenging. It is important to have a thorough understanding of what form(s) of 
variable compensation are possible within a group of similarly situated employ-
ees and the criteria that must be met to receive the variable payment.15
In cases where the amount of variable pay is directly tied to easily quantifiable 
metrics, such as revenue generated or on-time completion of project mile-
stones, the examination of variable pay takes on the form of an audit. Here, 
the analysis addresses whether the employee received the proper amount of 
variable compensation, as set forth in the compensation policy, based on the 
outcome of the metric in question (dollars of revenue, a “yes/no” condition 
for on-time completion, etc.).16
The potential for internal inequities is greatest within discretionary vari-
able pay. Here it is useful to examine the amount of variable pay received by 
each member of the similarly situated employee grouping to assess whether 
meaningful differences exist. The analysis may examine the dollar amount of 
bonuses or incentives relative to performance ratings or other measures of 
employee performance used in the decision-making process.
In certain circumstances, it may also be of interest to examine the eligibility 
requirements of a variable pay program for discrimination. This is a fundamentally 
different question; rather than examining whether different groups were treated 
differently (disparate treatment), the analysis examines whether the eligibility  
criteria themselves have a disparate impact by protected group status.17
15For example, some groups of employees may be eligible for profit sharing based on job 
function, level of responsibility within the organization, and so on, whereas other groups 
are not. In most cases, if employees have been grouped appropriately for comparison 
purposes, all members of the group will be eligible for the same kinds of variable pay.
16This is essentially an audit of whether the variable pay policy was followed.
17Formal statistical tests of disparate impact are presented in detail in Chapter 6.

Total Compensation
Because total compensation is the summation of all types of pay earned by an 
employee, its examination includes the peculiarities and pitfalls mentioned for 
base pay, overtime earnings, and variable pay. There is one additional point that 
should be made. Because total compensation is made up of various ­elements, 
it is possible that inequities in any given type of pay can be masked in an 
examination of total compensation.
For example, assume that the total compensation for a given group of similarly 
situated employees consists only of base pay and overtime earnings, and all 
employees in this grouping are identical on all characteristics (e.g., education, 
seniority, time in job, and so forth) and that the only difference within this group 
is the race of the employee. Further assume that Table 4-4 represents base pay, 
overtime earnings, and total compensation for the employees in this grouping.

A statistical review of total compensation indicates that there is zero differ-
ential by race. If, however, base pay is examined, there is a statistically signifi-
cant differential by race of $4,000; the base pay rate of nonwhites is $4,000 
less than the base pay rate of whites. There is also a statistically significant 
differential by race of $4,000 in overtime earnings; the overtime earnings of 
nonwhites are $4,000 greater than the overtime earnings of whites.
In this example, the differentials in base pay and overtime earnings cancel 
each other out when total compensation is examined. When looking only 
at the results of the total compensation analysis, one would infer that there 
are no equity problems by race. The opposite conclusion would be arrived at 
through an examination of base pay rates. 
Because of just this type of occurrence, it is generally preferable to examine indi-
vidual components of pay—or at a minimum, base pay—along with total com-
pensation. Aggregating compensation to its highest levels can mask potential 
problems in its individual components. Only by examining the constituent pieces 
of total compensation in isolation will these potential problems be uncovered.

Chapter 4 | The Data ﻿
100
Rates vs. Raises
The question of whether to examine pay rates or pay raises is interesting. 
There is value in both; the selection of rates or raises is dependent on the 
questions addressed by the analysis and what the researcher hopes to learn 
from the results. If one is interested in examining whether annual base salary 
increases are granted equitably, then raises would be the appropriate compen-
sation metric for analysis. If, on the other hand, the question to be addressed is 
whether base salaries of newly hired employees are set in a nondiscriminatory 
fashion, an examination of raises would be inappropriate; pay rates would be 
the appropriate compensation metric to examine.
It should be noted, however, that the results of a statistical review of raises 
does not provide any information about underlying compensation levels and 
vice versa. In fact, evaluating compensation solely in terms of raises may mask 
problems of internal pay equity.
For example, assume that within a given similarly situated employee grouping, 
employees differ only by gender and current year’s performance evaluation 
rating and are identical on all other characteristics (e.g., past performance, 
education, seniority, time in job, and so forth). Further assume that Table 4-5 
represents salary, performance rating, and raise information for this group of 
similarly situated employees:

A statistical review of the raises indicates that there is no disparity by gender. 
The annual percentage increases for men and women in this similarly situated 
employee grouping were awarded equitably and reflected differences in perfor-
mance evaluation rating: those rated 10 received a 3.5% increase and those rated 
8 received a 3.0% increase, regardless of gender. Based on an analysis of annual 
percentage increases, one would infer that no gender discrimination exists. 

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
101
However, an examination of annual salaries—whether “old” salaries before 
the raise or “new” salaries after it—reveals disparities by gender. The male 
salary was $56,000, and the female salary was $45,000. Because these 
employees differ only by gender and are identical on all other relevant 
characteristics, one would infer that gender discrimination may be present.  
If raises were the only metrics examined, then differences in salaries by gen-
der would go undetected. 
Factors Explaining Compensation
To examine the chosen compensation metric for internal equity, it is impor-
tant to account for legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors affecting compensa-
tion. Only by incorporating those factors into the model and accounting for 
their effect on pay can we begin to explore questions of potential internal 
inequity.18
Within the context of a compensation review, the task at hand is to iden-
tify factors that explain why similarly situated employees are paid differently. 
For example, assume that we are interested in examining a similarly situ-
ated employee grouping defined as all bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing 
clerks within the company. Even though these employees are similarly situated 
(they perform similar work and occupy positions that require similar skills 
and qualifications and have similar responsibility levels), we would not expect 
the annual salary, for example, to be identical for all employees within the 
grouping. Some employees will earn more, and some will earn less, based on 
legitimate nondiscriminatory factors. Some factors relate to the employee’s 
stock of human capital.
Human Capital
The conventional theory of labor markets says that an individual’s wage is 
based on his or her human capital stock and reflects personal productivity.19 
Human capital stock is the stock of knowledge, skills, aptitudes, education, 
and training that an individual possesses.20 In broad terms, human capital is 
the knowledge and characteristics a worker possesses that contribute to 
his productivity.
18For a review of why this is so, readers are referred to the example laid out in Table 3-1.
19Thomas Hyclak, Geraint Johnes, and Robert James Thornton, Fundamentals of Labor 
Economics (Cengage South-Western, 2005).
20Note that training is separate and apart from education. Training is the component of 
human capital that workers acquire after schooling. It is often associated with some set 
of skills useful for a particular industry or with a particular set of technologies.

 ﻿
102
Typically, differences in earnings between similarly situated employees are at least 
partly explained by differences in human capital. Differences in educational 
attainment, professional certifications, and licenses may account for variation 
in earnings among similarly situated employees. Within the similarly situated 
employee grouping defined as all bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerks, 
those with Certified Public Accountant designations may earn more than 
those without it. Those employees with payroll or tax certifications may earn 
more than those who do not possess these certifications.
Differences in training and skills acquired on the job may also account for 
variations in earnings among similarly situated employees. It is not uncom-
mon for workers who are newly hired or promoted into a position to 
earn less than those who have years of experience in that job. Similarly, an 
employee who has no prior experience may be hired at a pay rate lower 
than that of a person hired into the same job at the same time who has 
years of prior relevant experience. Common measures of training used by 
employers include number of years of relevant prior experience, time in job, 
length of service, seniority, and completion of company-sponsored training 
and development programs.
Other factors contributing to differences in compensation among similarly 
situated employees may directly reflect productivity. For example, per-
formance ratings are frequently used as part of the pay-setting process. 
Generally speaking, more productive employees receive better performance 
evaluations and higher performance ratings. This, in turn, typically translates 
into higher earnings.21 
The factors explaining differences in compensation within each similarly situ-
ated employee grouping are likely to differ across groupings and may differ 
across employers. For example, within the bookkeeping, accounting, and audit-
ing clerks grouping, possession of a CPA license or payroll or tax certification 
may lead to greater earnings. Within a similarly situated employee grouping 
defined as all outside salespersons, possession of a CPA license or payroll or 
tax certification is likely to have no bearing on compensation.22 Similarly, the 
number of patents held by an individual within a similarly situated employee 
grouping of engineers may partly explain differences in earnings within the 
group. Within the outside salespersons grouping, compensation is unlikely to 
be influenced by the number of patents held.
21 In some cases, performance ratings can be a tainted variable. Plaintiffs often contend that 
although their pay rates reflect their lower performance ratings, they were rated lower 
on performance because of discrimination. Tainted variables are discussed in detail in 
the next section.
22 In certain circumstances, such as sales of accounting, bookkeeping and auditing products 
or services, possession of a CPA license or payroll or tax certification could have an 
impact on compensation.

Because the legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors that explain differences in 
compensation are likely to vary across similarly situated employee groupings, 
a thorough understanding of the relevant compensation policies and practices 
is critical. Without this understanding, it will be extremely difficult to identify 
which factors should be included in the model specification for a given group 
of similarly situated employees.
Tainted Variables
When identifying the legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors that explain differ-
ences within similarly situated employee groupings, consideration should be 
given to the possibility that the variable may be tainted. Courts have labeled 
certain explanatory factors tainted if they are contaminated in some fashion 
by an employer’s discriminatory actions.23 Examples of explanatory variables 
that courts have found to be tainted include academic rank, disciplinary his-
tory, marital status, and part-time work assignment.24
Ramona Paetzhold and Steven Willborn provide the following example of a 
tainted variable:
Academic rank could be considered tainted if a university is believed to set 
different standards for awarding rank to males than to females. If academic 
rank were to be used in a compensation equation for that university, some 
of any sex-based differences in compensation may be reflected in the 
rank variable instead, so that the coefficient of the sex variable would 
underestimate the degree of discrimination in compensation.25
Tainted variables can pose substantial difficulty for detecting the presence or 
absence of discrimination using multiple regression analysis. The coefficient 
associated with the tainted variable may contain some of the discrimination 
23Generally speaking, courts question the inclusion of a tainted variable in a regression 
model of pay only if it is subject to some degree of employer discretion in its measurement 
or use.
24According to Paetzhold and Willborn, courts have not appropriately viewed tainted 
variables. They argue that “tainted variables are often highly important proxies of 
productivity or performance that contribute significantly to the explanation of salary 
or wages. Because the adequacy of the regression equation and the reliability of the 
inferences based on it depend, in part, on the completeness of the model, it is important 
not to exclude key predictor variables. It is our position that tainted variable should not 
be routinely excluded from the regression equation. Instead, the effects of the inclusion 
of a tainted variable must be assessed and minimized.” Ramona Paetzhold and Steven 
Willborn, The Statistics of Discrimination: Using Statistical Evidence in Discrimination Cases 
(West Publishing, 2011–2012), 298–300.

against the protected class. Because of this, the coefficient associated with 
protected class status will likely underestimate the degree of discrimination.  
In this case, examining only the protected class status variable could result in 
an incorrect inference regarding the presence or absence of discrimination.
It should be noted that a variable found to be tainted in one circumstance is 
not necessarily tainted in another. In the foregoing example, the fact that one 
employer used different standards for awarding academic rank to men and 
women does not automatically imply that every employer will do so. A given 
explanatory variable is not inherently tainted; it becomes tainted when it is 
infected by an employer’s discriminatory actions. 
Dummy Variables
Many of the factors explaining compensation are continuous variables.26 For 
example, time in job is an example of a continuous variable. It can take on 
different values (e.g., 0.0 years, 0.1 years, 0.2 years, 0.3 years) along the con-
tinuum of a person’s career. Other factors, however, are discrete and take 
on two or more distinct values.27 For example, a person can possess a CPA 
designation, or he can possess no CPA designation. It is not possible to “half-
possess” a CPA designation. 
In cases where discrete factors are included into the equation describing com-
pensation, they are typically incorporated through the use of dummy variables. 
A dummy variable can be used to express a “yes/no” condition. The possession 
of a CPA designation could be incorporated into the compensation equation 
by using a dummy variable named CPA.28 This CPA variable would take on a 
value of 1 if the individual held a CPA designation and would take on a value 
of 0 if he or she did not.29
26A variable is said to be continuous if it can take on any value along a continuum. Age is an 
example of a continuous variable. An individual can be 18.0 years old, 18.2 years old, 18.7 
years old, 19.0 years old, and so on.
27A variable is said to be discrete if it can take on a value from a set of distinct integers. For 
example, the number of children in a family is a discrete number. It is possible to have 1 
child in a family or 2 children in a family, but it is not possible to have 1.5 children in a 
family.
28Dummy variables can be named whatever the researcher wishes. Typically, a name is 
chosen that is related to the factor being measured for convenience and ease of use.
29The values in this example could be reversed. There is no reason that a value of 1 has 
to be associated with possession of the CPA designation. A value of 0 could just as 
easily be associated with possession of the CPA designation. The point is, in cases of a  
“yes/no” condition, whatever value is assigned to the “yes” condition cannot be assigned 
to the “no” condition.

105
Dummy variables are particularly useful in expressing protected group status. 
Protected group status is essentially a yes/no condition. An employee is either 
a member of the protected group or a member of the nonprotected group; he 
cannot simultaneously be a member of both groups. The use of a dummy vari-
able representing protected class status allows this status to be incorporated 
directly into the compensation equation.30
Dummy variables can also be used to express categorization of employees by 
discrete factors. Assume, for example, that an employee’s educational attain-
ment is a determinant of her compensation. Within a group of similarly situ-
ated employees, the educational attainment of those employees ranges from a 
high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree, as shown in Table 4-6.
30This point is discussed in detail in Chapter 5.

Educational attainment can be incorporated into the compensation equation 
through the use of dummy variables. A yes/no condition can be created for 
each of the unique values of the highest level of education achieved:
Is a high school diploma the highest level of education 
• 
completed by this employee?
Is an associate’s degree the highest level of education 
• 
completed by this employee?
Is a bachelor’s degree the highest level of education com-
• 
pleted by this employee?
Then, a dummy variable is created for each of the yes/no conditions, as shown 
in Figure 4-1.
s

Chapter 4 | The Data ﻿
106
Because the yes/no conditions regarding educational attainment in this  
example are mutually exclusive, no employee can have more than one yes 
(coded as 1) value.
These yes/no conditions are used to create dummy variables ED1, ED2, and 
ED3 for maximum educational attainment. Table 4-7 shows the values each of 
these dummy variables takes for these five employees.

This educational attainment example can be used to highlight a common mis-
take associated with the use of dummy variables. Less experienced practitio-
ners may be tempted to create one dummy variable for educational attainment 
and assign values to it based on the array of unique values of the highest level 
of education achieved. For example, a value of 1 would be assigned to high 
school diploma, a value of 2 would be assigned to associate’s degree, and a 
value of 3 would be assigned to bachelor’s degree, as shown in Table 4-8.

Assigning values in this manner makes the implicit assumption that the difference 
(in this case, in compensation) between those who earned a high school diploma 
and those who earned an associate’s degree is the same as the difference between 
those who earned an associate’s degree and those who earned a bachelor’s 
degree. This is implicitly assumed because the mathematical difference between 1 
and 2 and the mathematical difference between 2 and 3 is exactly equal.31
To see the effect on the regression analysis and associated results, consider 
the following example. Assume that the hourly pay rate for this group of 
employees is given in Table 4-9.
31(2 – 1) = 1 and (3 – 2) = 1.
In Table 4-9, we can see that the difference in hourly pay rates between indi-
viduals holding a high school diploma and an associate’s degree is $5 per hour 

Chapter 4 | The Data ﻿
108
($10 versus $15); the difference in hourly pay rates between individuals hold-
ing an associate’s degree and a bachelor’s degree is $10 ($15 versus $25).
If dummy variables for educational attainment were assigned as in Table 4-8, 
and assuming these five employees were identical with respect to all other 
explanatory variables in the model, the estimated effect of “more” educa-
tion (e.g., high school diploma compared to associate’s degree and associate’s 
degree compared to bachelor’s degree) would be $7.50 per hour; the esti-
mated intercept of this equation is $2.00 per hour.
Table  4-10 provides a comparison between actual hourly pay rates and 
­predicted hourly pay rates based on the estimated effect of educational attain-
ment at $7.50 per hour and an estimated intercept of $2.00 per hour.

As can be seen from Table 4-10, the model underestimates the hourly pay rates 
for those employees holding high school diplomas and bachelor’s degrees and 
overestimates the hourly pay rates for those holding an associate’s degree.
The inaccurate estimation of hourly rates of pay in this example is completely 
attributable to the way the dummy variable was created and used. Because only 
one dummy variable was used and took on values of 1, 2, and 3 for the three 
levels of educational attainment, the regression model forced the difference in 
educational attainment to be the same across all levels of education.32
If educational attainment was incorporated into the compensation model 
as given in Table 4-5, and assuming that these five employees were identical 
with respect to other explanatory variables in the model, the intercept of the 
model is $10 per hour. The estimated effect of having earned an associate’s 
degree is $5, and the estimated effect of having earned a bachelor’s degree 
would be $15 per hour. The actual and estimated hourly pay rates for these 
employees is shown Table 4-11.
32Again, this is because (2 – 1) = 1 and (3 – 2) = 1.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
109
As can be seen from Table 4-11, the actual and estimated hourly pay rates are 
identical. Because multiple dummy variables were used to express education in 
a series of yes/no conditions, the effect of educational attainment on compensa-
tion was not constrained to be equal across all educational attainment levels.
One final point regarding dummy variables should be kept in mind. In cases 
where multiple dummy variables are created for a series of yes/no conditions, 
as in the educational attainment example, inclusion of all of those variables 
creates collinearity. As noted in Chapter 3, the fourth assumption of the clas-
sical linear regression model is that no exact linear relationship exists between 
two or more independent variables. If ED1, ED2, and ED3 were all included in 
the model, the fourth assumption would be violated, because:
	
ED1 ED2
ED3

+
+
= 	
(4.1)
This situation is easily remedied by dropping one of the three dummy variables 
from the model. In the example shown in Table 4-9, only ED2 (possession of an 
associate’s degree) and ED3 (possession of a bachelor’s degree) were included 
in the model; ED1 (possession of a high school diploma) was omitted to prevent 
collinearity. The model that was estimated generated the following results:

In this example, those employees whose highest educational attainment was 
a high school diploma are said to be the reference group.33 In terms of inter-
pretation of the regression output, all estimated coefficients are relative to the 
reference group. Thus, the hourly pay rate of the reference group—those indi-
viduals with high school diplomas—is equal to the intercept of the equation: 
$10. The hourly pay rate of those individuals possessing associate’s degrees is 
33The reference group is defined as those individuals satisfying (i.e., those for whom the 
answer is “yes”) the yes/no condition expressed by the dummy variable omitted from 
the model.

Dummy variables can be a very useful way to incorporate discrete variables 
and qualitative information into a model of compensation. However, as evi-
denced by the preceding discussion, care should be exercised in how those 
dummy variables are structured and the values assigned to them.
Data Measurability
Some of the factors explaining differences in compensation among similarly 
situated employees will be easy to measure and quantify. For example, com-
pany seniority may be maintained directly in an organization’s human resources 
database. In other cases, it can be calculated using each employee’s date of 
hire, a data point that is commonly maintained in HR databases.34 In cases 
such as this, the factor is measured directly in the database itself and can be 
extracted for all similarly situated employees in the grouping.
Unfortunately, not all factors explaining differences in compensation among 
similarly situated employees can be measured directly. In these cases, mea-
surement poses a difficulty. This difficulty is most commonly caused by data 
limitations. The employer may not maintain comprehensive information on 
the factor in its HR database, or the information may not be captured in a 
machine-readable format.35 In other cases, the factor itself may be difficult to 
quantify. In these cases, proxy variables are often used.
Proxy variables are substituted for the original variable that is difficult to 
quantify or measure. A good proxy variable is easily measurable and is highly 
correlated with the factor for which it is being substituted. In some cases, a 
good proxy variable will be easily identifiable. In other cases, a good proxy 
variable may be difficult to identify.
For example, prior relevant work experience may be a critical factor in 
explaining differences in compensation within a similarly situated employee 
grouping. If information on prior relevant work experience is not quantified 
in a machine-readable format within an organization’s HR database, a proxy 
34In some cases, seniority is simple to calculate; it is the number of years between the 
current date and the employee’s date of hire. The calculation becomes more complex 
in cases of breaks in service. For example, layoff and recall situations can complicate 
the calculation of seniority. An employee who is laid off and later recalled to work 
may or may not accrue seniority during the layoff period. Interruptions in service are 
not uncommon, and how those breaks in service are factored into each employee’s 
calculation of seniority depends on the particular policies of each employer.
35These situations will be discussed in detail in a subsequent subsection of this chapter.

111
variable may be used. A commonly chosen proxy variable for prior relevant 
work experience is age at hire.
Age at hire may, on its surface, appear to be a good proxy for prior relevant 
work experience. Age is hire is easily measurable. It is calculated simply as 
the difference between an employee’s date of hire and that employee’s date 
of birth. Dates of birth and dates of hire are nearly universally maintained 
in an organization’s human resources databases. Further, one would expect 
that age at hire would be correlated with prior relevant work experience—
“older” workers typically have more prior experience than “younger” work-
ers because they have spent more time participating in the labor force. 
However, a number of assumptions are made when age at hire is used as 
a proxy for prior relevant work experience: all individuals in the grouping 
of similarly situated employees (1) began their education at the same age,  
(2) completed their education at the same age, (3) entered the labor force at 
the same age, (4) have been accruing the same level and amount of relevant 
experience since entering the labor force, and (5) have been participating in 
the labor force continuously since entry.
The assumptions regarding educational trajectories may pose potential prob-
lems, depending on the particular grouping of employees. It may not be unrea-
sonable to assume that all employees started their education at the same age.36 
It may be unreasonable, however, to assume that all of them completed their 
education at the same age, particularly if differences in educational attainment 
are not controlled for separately in the model of compensation.37 
It may also be unreasonable to assume that all employees entered the work-
force at the same age. Differences in educational attainment aside, not everyone 
shares the same education-to-employment trajectory. Among those with bach-
elor’s degrees, for example, some may complete high school at age eighteen, 
immediately enroll in college and earn a bachelor’s degree at age twenty-two, 
and immediately enter the labor force. Some people may not immediately enroll 
in college after high school, instead choosing military service or entrance into 
the workforce before enrolling in college. This would, of course, delay their 
entrance into the labor force on completion of a bachelor’s degree. Others may 
choose to delay entrance into the workforce after earning a bachelor’s degree,  
36In the United States, children typically begin school at the age of five. Some children may 
start a few months before their fifth birthday, and others may start a few months after. 
Generally speaking, these variations do not pose a substantial problem.
37If, for example, educational attainment was not explicitly included as an explanatory factor 
in the model of compensation, and educational attainment varied among employees in 
the grouping, age at hire would implicitly assume that the number of years spent earning 
a high school diploma and the number of years spent earning a bachelor’s degree were 
identical. This is clearly an unrealistic assumption.

112
spending time traveling, exploring opportunities, and so on. Using age at hire as a 
proxy ignores these possibilities, leading to an inaccurate measurement of prior 
relevant work experience.
Even so, the experience gained in prior employment may not reflect relevant
work experience. A person may change from one job to another and have 
completely different functional responsibilities or may change occupation, 
industry, and so on. The training and on-the-job skills acquired prior to the 
change may not be relevant to the current employment. Training and skills 
acquired through practical experience are not necessarily transferable to a 
new job, occupation, industry, and so on. If the skill sets and human capital 
requirements differ substantially between prior and current employment, then 
the use of age at hire as a proxy is likely to overstate actual prior relevant 
work experience.
The assumption that all individuals have been participating in the labor force 
continuously is likely to be inaccurate. Individuals routinely experience peri-
ods of absence from the labor force for reasons such as their own or a family 
member’s illness or injury, personal or family obligations, maternity or pater-
nity leave, child care issues, civic or military duty, and so forth. The use of age 
at hire as a proxy for prior relevant work experience does not and in fact 
cannot account for periods of absence from the labor force for any of these 
reasons. As such, age at hire is likely to overstate actual prior relevant experi-
ence for some individuals.38
As can be seen from this example, the use of proxy variables can introduce 
biases into the analysis. Caution should be exercised when using proxy vari-
ables, and careful consideration should be given to their choice, as they can 
have a considerable effect on the results of the statistical analysis and infer-
ences drawn from it.
Accessibility of Data
Related to data measurability is the issue of data accessibility. As previously 
mentioned, difficulty in measurement of the factors explaining compensation 
is most commonly caused by data limitations. The employer may not maintain 
comprehensive information on the factor, or the information may not be cap-
tured in a machine-readable format.
38 Perhaps of greater importance to the issue of internal pay equity is the fact that use of 
age at hire as a proxy for prior relevant work experience can introduce a gender bias 
into the compensation model. Women typically experience greater periods of absence 
from the labor force than do their male counterparts. Because age at hire cannot account 
for periods of absence, its use as a proxy may lead to a disproportionate overstatement 
of prior relevant work experience for women, introducing gender bias. This point is 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
113
For example, assume that an employer is interested in examining its initial pay-
setting practices to assess internal pay equity among newly hired employees. 
One of the factors influencing a newly hired employee’s initial pay is salary his-
tory in previous employment. Assume that information regarding a candidate’s 
salary history is captured only at the interview stage, in the form of interviewer 
notes; salary history is not requested or recorded on the job application.
This scenario presents several difficulties. First, this process requires that 
the notes created by the interviewer regarding the candidate’s salary history 
in previous employment find their way into the candidate’s personnel file. 
Although an employer may have a clearly stated policy mandating that inter-
viewers record information on salary history and place that information into 
the file, it is always possible that the policy will be violated, perhaps uninten-
tionally. If the notes are not included in the file, the salary history information 
will be missing, which poses a sizeable difficulty not only for an internal review 
of pay equity but also for defending the compensation decisions in the event 
of litigation or regulatory investigation.
The salary history information must be retained and maintained in a manner 
that allows for easy, on-demand future access. If an organization uses hard-
copy personnel files, the interview notes typically would be placed in the file 
alongside other types of documentation. Retrieval of salary history in the 
future may involve sifting through the employee’s file to find the appropriate 
documents. Although this is not necessarily resource-intensive or time-con-
suming for a single employee, the costs involved increase dramatically when 
salary history information for multiple individuals (e.g., all those within a simi-
larly situated employee grouping) must be found.39
Even assuming that the salary history notes are placed appropriately in per-
sonnel files and are retrievable on demand, there is still the problem of consis-
tency of information. Some interviewers may collect prior salary history for 
multiple years, whereas other interviewers may collect only the most recent 
figures. Some may collect salary history in a very detailed manner (e.g., 2011: 
$74,560, 2012: $77,925) and others may collect more general information 
(e.g., 2011: $75K, 2012: $78K). 
Differences like these create inconsistencies in the data and can create ­barriers 
for performing an analysis of internal pay equity. For example, if some newly 
hired employees in a given similarly situated grouping have three years of 
salary history and others have only one, then only one year of salary history 
can enter into the analysis, because that is the extent of complete data for all 
newly hired employees within the grouping.
39This difficulty is compounded if there are multiple storage sites or repositories for 
information, because efforts between sites or repositories must be coordinated.

Chapter 4 | The Data ﻿
114
Even so, information that is collected and retained in hard copy is not in a 
machine-readable state. Some kind of data entry to convert the information 
into an electronic form is required before analysis can proceed. Contrary to 
popular conceptions, this process requires more than just scanning hard-copy 
documents into PDF files and using optical character recognition (OCR) to 
create a database.40 Data entry processes—even those assisted by the latest 
technological advances—are time-consuming and very resource-intensive.
Most difficulties with data accessibility can be avoided through the use of a 
well-designed human resources information system (HRIS). An HRIS system 
has many advantages; they allow for standardized collection of information in 
a centralized repository. The information is maintained in an electronic for-
mat that can easily be searched via queries, which greatly facilitates on-demand 
information retrieval. Electronic retention of information also reduces stor-
age costs associated with maintaining hard-copy files. Finally, an HRIS system 
retains data in an electronic format which, generally speaking, can be exported 
directly to a data file that can easily be read by commercially available statisti-
cal software. This can greatly reduce, if not completely eliminate, the need for 
costly data entry.
There is one additional issue with respect to the availability of data that 
should be discussed: availability of historical information. It is important 
that an employee’s entire history, from earliest date of hire to the present  
(or, if applicable, to the most recent date of termination), is maintained. 
Overwriting historical values with current values or otherwise failing to pre-
serve historical employment information in the organization’s HRIS system 
can be extremely problematic, particularly for internal pay equity analyses. To 
see this, consider the following example.
Assume that a company is engaging in a multiyear retrospective equity review 
of the annual salaries of a similarly situated employee grouping containing 
program managers in a given geographic location. The retrospective review 
will encompass three years and examine pay rates as of April 1 of 2011, 2012, 
and 2013. Further assume that program managers’ annual salaries are based 
on (among other factors) company seniority and time in job.
40Although advances in optical character recognition in recent years have been substantial, 
in most cases one cannot simply rely on OCR software to create a machine-readable 
database from PDF files. Layouts may differ from page to page, print quality and resolution 
may differ, some portions of the documents may be unreadable, and so on. It is necessary 
to verify that the OCR software has accurately captured the data, and fill in any data 
points missed by the software manually, if possible.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
115
Since the time period encompassed by the analysis is April 1, 2011 through 
April 1, 2013, one might think that extracting all records for a given employee 
falling within this time period from the HRIS system would be sufficient. The 
data from such an extraction for one employee—ID # 4746—is shown in 
Table 4-12.
41If this person was the only one (or one of only a few employees) for whom time in job 
could not be calculated, one alternative is to omit him (or the small group) from the 
analysis. If time in job information is missing for a sufficient number of employees, the 
alternative may be to omit time in job as an explanatory factor from the model. Neither 
situation is ideal.

As can be seen, these data provide the annual salaries of this employee for 
the time period in question. Because these data also contain the employee’s 
date of hire, his company seniority can be calculated. It should be noted that 
this calculation assumes he had no leaves of absence during the June 1, 2007 
to April 1, 2013 time period. We know with certainty that there were no 
periods of absence from April 1, 2011 through April 1, 2013, because there 
are no entries in the HRIS reflecting periods of absence. We do not know, 
however, whether there were any periods of absence from this employee’s 
date of hire prior to April 1, 2011, because no HRIS information for this time 
period was extracted. A calculation of company seniority based solely on the 
information contained in this data set might not be accurate. 
Time in job is one of the factors that determine an individual’s annual salary. 
The data set shown in Table 4-12 does not contain sufficient information to 
calculate this person’s time in job. Thus, it is not possible to determine when 
this employee commenced employment as a program manager. We know that 
it was prior to April 1, 2011, but the data set provides no further information. 
Without knowing this piece of information, there is no way to assess this 
individual’s salary against his comparators accounting for all relevant factors 
determining annual salary.41
Table  4-13 presents this worker’s complete employment history with the 
organization and provides the information required to properly calculate 
company seniority and time in job.

The data set shown in Table 4-12 is said to be truncated; it does not encom-
pass all records for the employee contained in the HRIS system from the 
employee’s earliest hire date to the current date.42 Only a portion of the 
records—those whose effective dates fall within the April 1, 2011 to April 1, 
2013 time period—have been extracted. Because of this, the data extraction 
does not provide all of the information necessary to complete the multi-year 
retrospective equity review of the annual salaries for this similarly situated 
employee grouping.
It is critical that a comprehensive, “cradle to grave” data set be provided that 
encompasses the entire employment histories of all employees within the 
similarly situated grouping. Failure to provide this comprehensive data set may 
prevent an accurate and complete analysis of internal pay equity.
Data Collection and Assembly
After assessing the measurability of the factors determining compensation 
and resolving any difficulties with the accessibility of these data points, data 
collection and assembly can proceed.
The goal for collecting and assembling data is to construct an employee-level  
data set that captures all information relevant to the compensation  
decision-making process for each person in the study population. The rele-
vant information and data points will be defined by the factors that determine 
compensation within each similarly situated employee grouping.
42A data set encompassing all records for employees from earliest hire date through the 
current date is often referred to or characterized as a “cradle to grave” data set.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
117
The way data collection and assembly will proceed depends on the informa-
tion systems of the organization. If the organization maintains its HR and 
compensation information in an electronic database, then a query should be 
carefully constructed to extract the relevant information for the relevant 
employees. When constructing the query, ensure that all relevant job codes, 
departments, divisions, and so on are included so that all information for all 
individuals in the study population is captured.
Extracting all relevant information about each employee in each of the simi-
larly situated employee groupings contained in the study population in the 
same query allows the creation of one comprehensive data set. If required 
information is missing from the initial query, if relevant job codes are inadver-
tently missing from the initial query, and so on, it will be necessary to either 
reextract all information or create a supplemental file that will then have 
to be appended to the original file. This can be a costly process, in terms of 
both financial cost and time. It also introduces the opportunity for mistakes 
to be made when appending supplemental files to the original. Take the time 
to formulate a complete and comprehensive query for extracting all relevant 
information for all relevant employees in one file.
If the organization does not maintain its HR and compensation information in 
an electronic database, it will be necessary to assemble the required informa-
tion by hand; all of the foregoing guidelines hold for manual assembly of data. 
When manually constructing the data set for the compensation review, the 
financial cost and time required to repair an inaccurate or incomplete file is 
substantially increased. Ensure that all relevant information for all relevant 
employees is captured in the initial file construction.
Data Cleaning and Verification
Prior to performing the statistical analysis, the data sets must be cleaned and 
reviewed for gaps and missing data. All problems should be identified, and if 
possible, corrected. If, for example, the compensation rates for a given grouping 
of similarly situated employees contains a mixture of hourly rates and annual 
salary figures, it is necessary to convert the hourly rates to annual salaries or 
vice versa (refer to Table 4-2). Adjustments to full-time equivalents may be 
necessary if the standard number of hours per day or per week differs across 
employees (refer to Table 4-3). The point here is that the data should be 
internally consistent among employee groupings. It is not problematic from a 
statistical point of view to express compensation in terms of an hourly rate for 
some employee groupings and in terms of an annual salary amount for other 
employee groupings. The key here is consistency within groupings, because the 
groupings serve as the unit of analysis for the multiple regression analysis.
If there are any gaps in the data that can be filled, the additional data should be 
collected and integrated into the data set. For example, if date of birth is missing 

Chapter 4 | The Data ﻿
118
for some employees, and age at hire is to be used in the multiple regression anal-
ysis, the missing date of birth information should be collected and integrated. 
Entering 0 for those individuals with missing dates of birth can potentially have a 
strong impact on the estimated effect of age at hire on compensation.
If the gaps are sufficiently large and/or are unable to be filled, and no suit-
able proxy variable exists, it may be necessary to remove that factor from 
the analysis.
Aside from ensuring a correct and comprehensive data set for the compensa-
tion review, examining gaps in data can provide valuable insight into the orga-
nization’s processes and procedures for data capture and retention. Missing 
pieces of information for one or two employees is probably not indicative of a 
larger problem. If the same piece of information is missing for many employees, 
however, this could be an indication of a systemic problem in the data cap-
ture and retention process. Systemic data gaps should be investigated and any  
deficiencies in data processes should be corrected so that future problems can 
be avoided.

Regression 
Models of  
Equal Pay
Since 1975 multiple regression analysis has been the preferred statistical tech-
nique for identifying compensation discrimination based on protected class 
status.1 This technique is used by plaintiffs and defendants to demonstrate 
discrimination (or lack thereof), and was approved by the U.S. Supreme Court 
for analysis of pay discrimination in 1986.2
Traditional models for examining equal pay generally fall into the two forms 
suggested in the Harvard Law Review.3

1.	 The classic model: Regressing the dependent variable 
(some measure of compensation) on legitimate, non-
discriminatory factors and a dummy variable for pro-
tected status.
2.	 The separate equations model: Separating the sample 
into protected and nonprotected groups and then 
regressing the dependent variable (some measure 
of compensation) on legitimate, nondiscriminatory 
­factors (excluding a dummy variable for protected 
status) for each of the two groups.
These two model structures are based on different underlying assumptions 
and lead to different kinds of inferences regarding the relationship between 
compensation and protected group status.
As will be discussed later, both approaches have distinct advantages and disad-
vantages. Researchers have proposed a third model structure that capitalizes 
on the advantages of the classical and separate equations approaches, referred 
to as an interaction model. The aim of the interaction model is to leverage the 
advantages of the classical and separate equations structures while reducing 
the impact of their disadvantages.
All three model structures classify individuals within the similarly situated 
employee grouping on the basis of protected group status. Although this is 
useful for assessing discrimination on the basis of protected group status, these 
structures are not ideal for assessing overall equity. Assessing whether simi-
larly situated white males, for example, are paid equitably is better achieved 
through an alternate model structure in which protected group effects are 
not directly estimated. One such alternate model structure is referred to as 
the overall equity model.
The Classical Model
The classical model is the most commonly used structure for examining  
the relationship between protected group status and compensation. This 
is due largely to the fact that it is easy to understand conceptually, the cal-
culations involved are simple, and the interpretation of results generated is 
straightforward.
The purpose of the classical model is to directly estimate the effect of pro-
tected group status on compensation, controlling for other relevant explana-
tory factors. Direct estimation of the protected group effect is achieved by 
including a dummy variable representing protected group status.4
4A detailed discussion of dummy variables is provided in Chapter 4.

This structure expresses compensation as a function of its determinants 
(seniority, time in job, education, prior relevant work experience, performance 
ratings, etc.) and whether the employee is a member of the protected group. 
The estimated coefficient of protected group status reflects the effect of pro-
tected group status after accounting for the effects of all the determinants of 
compensation. Because of this, the classical model directly estimates the effect 
of protected group status on compensation. This, in turn, means that the esti-
mated protected group effect can be directly tested for statistical significance.
The classical model of pay equity contains several inherent assumptions. Just 
as for the classical linear regression model, we assume the following:5
1.	 The dependent variable (compensation) can be calcu-
lated as a linear function of a specific set of indepen-
dent variables and an error term;
2.	 The error term has zero expected value for all 
observations;
3.	 Errors have constant variance for all observations and 
are not correlated;
4.	 No exact linear relationship exists between two or 
more independent variables; and
5.	 The independent variables are nonstochastic (i.e., can 
be considered fixed in repeated sampling).
Within the context of the classical model of pay equity, the error variances 
for the protected and nonprotected groups is assumed to be equal. This is 
5A detailed discussion of the assumptions of the classical linear regression model is provided 
in Chapter 3.

Chapter 5 | Regression Models of Equal Pay 
122
an important assumption. Essentially, this means that the effects of the factors 
explaining compensation are constant across protected group status. If a one-year 
increase in seniority, for example, leads to a $2,000 increase in annual salary,   
this model structure assumes that this one-year-to-$2,000 relationship is 
identical for protected and nonprotected employees. 
Herein lies the main disadvantage of this model structure. Because of this 
assumption, the classical model of pay equity cannot detect cases of discrimi-
nation in which the factors explaining compensation contribute differently to 
the compensation of different protected groups. 
For example, it could be the case that an additional year of seniority leads 
to a $2,300 increase in annual salary for whites but only a $1,800 increase in 
annual salary for nonwhites as a result of discrimination. In essence, the clas-
sical model would combine these two effects across protected group status 
and generate an average effect for all employees, irrespective of protected 
group status. This would mask the discrimination created by providing larger 
increases for whites for additional years of seniority. Because of its underlying 
assumptions, the classical model structure cannot detect this type of compen-
sation discrimination.
To see how the classical model of pay equity is applied, consider the following 
example. Assume that we are interested in examining whether there are dif-
ferences in annual salary by gender for a similarly situated employee grouping. 
Within this grouping, there are eight individuals: four women and four men. 
Annual salaries are determined based on time in job and years of prior rel-
evant experience. 
Further assume that salary, gender, time in job, and years of prior relevant 
experience data for these employees are given in Table 5-1. This table also 
includes a dummy variable for gender.6

Figure 5-1 provides the regression output when Equation 5.2 is estimated 
using the data shown in Table 5-1.
Figure 5-1.  Regression output
As can be seen from Figure 5-1, the classical model of pay equity provides 
an estimate of the coefficients associated with all of the factors explaining 
compensation, including D1, the dummy variable for protected group status. 
The coefficient associated with D1 is a direct estimate of the protected group 
effect. In this example, the protected group effect is the gender effect.
The estimated coefficient associated with D1 is –$1,857.907. The interpre-
tation of this coefficient is that there is a gender penalty for women equal 
to $1,857.907. Because the coefficient is negative, the effect of being female  
(D1 = 1) is $1,857.907 less per year. In other words, a comparison of the 
annual salaries of two employees—one male and one female—with identical 
time in job and prior relevant work experience would reveal a $1,857.907 
difference in favor of the male employee. 
However, the gender effect is not statistically significant; the associated prob-
ability value of 0.536 indicates that chance is the likely explanation for the 
observed differences by gender.7 Thus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis 
that the true effect of gender on compensation, after controlling for time in 
7Under the generally accepted standard of 95% confidence (assuming a two-tailed test), the 
threshold for statistical significance is 0.05. Results with associated probability values less 
than or equal to 0.05 are considered to be statistically significant. Results with associated 
probability values greater than 0.05 are considered to be statistically insignificant (i.e., not 
statistically significant).

Chapter 5 | Regression Models of Equal Pay 
124
job and years of prior relevant experience, is zero. We would therefore infer 
that these compensation decisions are neutral with respect to gender.8
Had the estimated coefficient associated with D1 been a positive number, 
there would be a gender premium. A comparison of the annual salaries of one 
male and one female employee with identical time in job and prior relevant 
work experience would reveal a difference in favor of the female employee.
When assessing the magnitude of the protected group effect, it is critical to 
consider the way the dummy variable(s) representing protected group status 
was coded. In this example, D1 took on a value of 0 for male employees and 
a value of 1 for female employees. The equation is therefore measuring the 
effect of being female; a negative coefficient indicates a female penalty and a 
positive coefficient indicates a female premium.
If the coding had been reversed (1 for male employees and 0 for female 
employees), this same data set would generate an estimated D1 coefficient of 
+$1,857.907. The estimate is positive, rather than negative, because the equa-
tion would be measuring the effect of being male.
When evaluating the estimated protected group effect (and the effects of the 
variables explaining compensation as well), statistical significance and prac-
tical significance (i.e., the direction and magnitude of the estimated effect) 
should be viewed in light of the size of the sample being studied, as well as the 
explanatory power of the model.9
The classical model of pay equity can be expanded to include dummy variables 
representing more than one protected class definition. For example, assume 
that we are interested in examining whether there are differences in annual 
salary by gender and/or by race for a similarly situated employee grouping. 
Within this grouping, there are ten individuals: four women and six men, and 
five white and five nonwhite. Annual salaries for these employees are deter-
mined based on seniority. 
Further assume that salary, seniority, gender, and race data for these employ-
ees are given in Table 5-2, which also includes dummy variables for gender  
and race.10
 8Readers are reminded that if a coefficient is not statistically significant, the effect of that 
variable is not statistically different from zero. If a coefficient is not statistically significant, 
no adverse inference can or should be drawn. A basic overview of statistical significance 
is provided in the Appendix.
 9This point is discussed in Chapter 3.
10DF is coded 1 for females and 0 for males; DNW is coded 1 for nonwhites and 0 for 
whites.

As can be seen from Figure 5-2, the regression process has estimated two 
coefficients associated with the dummy variables. These estimated coeffi-
cients are interpreted the same way as in the previous example. The esti-
mated coefficient associated with gender is negative (–$2,878.957), indicating 
that there is a gender penalty for women equal to $2,878.957. In other words, 
a comparison of the annual salaries one male and one female employee with 
identical seniority would reveal a $2,878.957 difference in favor of the man.

Chapter 5 | Regression Models of Equal Pay 
126
The gender effect here is statistically significant; the associated probabil-
ity value of 0.025 indicates that chance is not the likely explanation for the 
observed differences by gender. We reject the null hypothesis that the true 
effect of gender on compensation, after controlling for time in job and years 
of prior relevant experience, is zero. Based on these results, we would infer 
that the compensation decisions represented in Table 5-2 are not neutral with 
respect to gender.
However, it would be incorrect to automatically assume that the cause of this 
difference by gender is the result of gender discrimination. Although gender 
discrimination may play a role, there are a variety of other explanations. For 
example, it is possible that the model has been misspecified via omission of a 
legitimate, nondiscriminatory determinant of compensation that happens to 
be correlated with gender. The observed difference by gender is possibly the 
result of chance (although it may be unlikely or rare, it is not impossible). In 
fact, over repeated sampling we would expect to see a difference as large—or 
larger—25 times out of 1,000 samples.
The estimated coefficient associated with the race dummy variable, DNW, 
is –$1,378.744. The interpretation of this coefficient is that there is a race 
penalty for nonwhites equal to $1,378,744. Because the coefficient is nega-
tive, the effect of being nonwhite (DNW = 1) is $1,378.744 less per year.  
A comparison of the annual salaries of one white and one nonwhite employee 
with identical seniority would reveal a $1,378.744 difference in favor of the 
white employee. 
However, the race effect is not statistically significant; the associated prob-
ability value of 0.183 indicates that chance is the likely explanation for the 
observed differences by race. Thus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that 
the true effect of race on compensation, after controlling for seniority, is zero. 
Based on these results, we would infer that the compensation decisions rep-
resented in Table 5-2 are neutral with respect to race.
It should be noted that in Equation 5.3, the effect of gender is estimated sepa-
rately and apart from the effect of race and vice versa. The estimated coef-
ficients provide only information about the effect on compensation of being 
female or of being nonwhite. They do not provide information about the 
effect on compensation of being both female and nonwhite. To measure this 
joint effect, it is necessary to incorporate an additional dummy variable that 
measures both gender and race.11 This dummy variable (DCOMB) is given  
in Table 5-3.
11In this case, we create a dummy variable representing the interaction of gender and race. 
Interaction terms are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

These estimated coefficients are interpreted the same way as in the previ-
ous example. The estimated coefficient associated with gender is negative 
(–$1,331.281), indicating that there is a gender penalty for women equal to 

Chapter 5 | Regression Models of Equal Pay 
128
$1,331.281. However, the gender effect is not statistically significant; the asso-
ciated probability value of 0.327 indicates that chance is the likely explanation 
for the observed differences. Thus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that 
the true effect of gender on compensation, after controlling for seniority, is 
zero. Based on these results, we would infer that the compensation decisions 
represented in Table 5-3 are neutral with respect to gender.
The estimated coefficient associated with race is –$195.807. The interpreta-
tion of this coefficient is that there is a race penalty for nonwhites equal to 
$195.807. However, the race effect is not statistically significant; the associated 
probability value of 0.859 indicates that chance is the likely explanation for 
the observed differences by race. Thus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis 
that the true effect of race on compensation, after controlling for seniority, is 
zero. Based on these results, we would infer that the compensation decisions 
represented in Table 5-3 are neutral with respect to race.
The estimated coefficient associated with the interaction of gender and race is 
–$2,888.337. The interpretation of this coefficient is that there is a nonwhite 
female penalty equal to $2,888.337. A comparison of the annual salaries of a 
white male and a nonwhite female employee with identical seniority would 
reveal a $2,888.337 difference in favor of the white male.
The effect of the interaction of gender and race is not statistically signifi-
cant; the associated probability value of 0.142 indicates that chance is the 
likely explanation for the observed differences. Thus, we cannot reject the 
null hypothesis that the true effect of the interaction of gender and race on 
compensation, after controlling for seniority, is zero. Based on these results, 
we would infer that the compensation decisions represented in Table 5-3 are 
neutral with respect to the interaction of gender and race.
As previously noted, the classical model structure is favored for its ability to 
be easily understood, its simple calculations, and its straightforward interpre-
tation. This model, however, cannot detect cases of discrimination in which 
the factors explaining compensation contribute differently to the compensa-
tion of different protected groups. To detect this kind of discrimination, the 
separate equations model structure is often used.
Separate Equations Model
The separate equations model structure has been used in compensation dis-
crimination litigation as an alternative to the classical model structure.12 The 
purpose of the separate equations model is to allow for the possibility that 
the factors determining compensation have different effects on compensation 
between the protected and nonprotected groups.
12For example, Ottaviani v. State University of New York, 875 F2d 365, 1989.

This structure expresses compensation as a function of the determinants of 
compensation (seniority, time in job, education, prior relevant work experi-
ence, performance ratings, etc.). Rather than including protected group status 
as a dummy variable, separate equations are estimated for the protected and 
nonprotected groups. 
Unlike the classical model structure, the effect of protected group status on 
compensation is not directly estimated. Arriving at an estimation of the effect 
of protected group status (and its associated level of significance) is more 
complex. This point can best be illustrated using the following example.
Imagine that we are interested in examining whether there are differences 
in annual salary by gender for a given grouping of similarly situated univer-
sity professors. Annual salary is determined based on semesters of senior-
ity, semesters of prior teaching experience, the number of courses currently 
taught, the number of dissertation students supervised in the current semes-
ter, and the professor’s educational attainment. Further assume that among 
the male professors, there is a mixture of educational attainment (PhD and 
ABD degrees);13 all female professors have doctoral degrees.14
The separate equations model structure for this example is provided in 
Equations 5.6A and 5.6B.15
13ABD refers to “all but dissertation” and is awarded in cases where the doctoral candidate 
has completed all of the required coursework but has not yet defended his dissertation.
14This hypothetical example is used for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to 
reflect or imply anything about the way dissertation students are supervised in reality.
15The dummy variable coefficient takes on a value of 0 for ABD and a value of 1 for a 
doctoral degree.

Figures 5-4A and 5-4B provide the regression output when Equations 5.6A 
and 5.6B are estimated, respectively. As can be seen, the estimated effect 
of protected group status on compensation is not immediately obvious, as 
it was under the classical model structure. This is the main disadvantage of 
the separate equations model structure. Comparison of individual coefficients 
may not reveal insights into the effect of gender on compensation. For exam-
ple, comparing the coefficients associated with prior teaching experience, we 
see that men receive on average $2,945 for each semester of prior teach-
ing experience, whereas women receive $1,303 on average. This indicates 
that women receive less pay than their male counterparts for the same prior 
teaching experience. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis of gender 
discrimination.

131
On the other hand, we see that men receive $2,017 (on average) for each 
semester of seniority, and women receive $2,218 (on average). This indicates 
that women receive more pay than their male counterparts for the same seniority. 
This finding is inconsistent with the hypothesis of gender discrimination.
Comparing each individual coefficient for protected and nonprotected indi-
viduals may not reveal any clear patterns of discrimination. It is often the 
case—as in the foregoing example—that neither group consistently experi-
ences higher coefficients for all of the factors explaining compensation. One 
group has higher estimated coefficients on some variables, and the other 
group has higher estimated coefficients on other variables.
Additionally, as noted by Ramona Paetzhold and Steven Willborn, direct 
comparison of the estimated coefficients is warranted only if the coeffi-
cients in both equations are individually interpretable.16 As can be seen from 
Figure 5-4B, education does not enter into the equation for female professors 
because there is no variation in educational attainment among them.
Because the separate equations model does not directly estimate the effect 
of protected group status on compensation, this effect must be estimated in a 
different way. A common method is to examine the residuals generated by fit-
ting the protected group’s data to the nonprotected group’s fitted regression 
equation and vice versa. As noted by Paetzhold and Willborn:
Since the average residual for the data on which the equation is based 
must be zero, any deviation from zero for the women’s data indicates the 
extent to which the regression equation does not fit the women’s data 
as well as it fits the men’s data and could serve as a measure of salary 
discrimination based on sex. Thus, if the average residual for women (fit 
against the men’s regression equation) were negative and large enough 
in magnitude, a legal inference of salary discrimination based on sex may 
be warranted.17
To see how this fitting process is conducted, we examine one female employee 
for illustrative purposes. Professor Jane Smith’s annual salary and characteris-
tics are given in Table 5-4.

Evidence in Discrimination Cases (West Publishing, 2011–2012), 284.

We can use information about her characteristics, along with the male param-
eter estimates shown in Equation 5.7, to predict what Jane Smith’s annual

Using Equation 5.7, we would predict her salary to be $61,452.18 Her actual 
salary is $50,000. Her residual is equal to the difference between actual and 
predicted salary, as shown in Equation 5.8:
$50,000
$61,452
$11,452

(5.8)
As can be seen, Jane Smith’s residual is equal to –$11,452. This means that 
had she been a man, given her seniority, prior experience, current course load, 
students supervised, and education, she would be expected to earn $11,452 
more than she is currently earning.
To assess whether a legal inference of pay discrimination among this group of 
college professors based on sex is warranted, we would perform this same 
calculation for all women in the similarly situated employee grouping, generat-
ing an average residual. If the average residual is negative and large enough in 
magnitude, an inference of discrimination may be warranted.
As can be seen from this discussion, estimating the effect of protected group 
status on compensation using the separate equations approach is a complex 
process. Interpreting the results generated by analyzing compensation with 
this model is challenging. Because of this, it is often rejected in favor of the 
classical model structure.

The Interaction Model
A third model structure, the interaction model, combines the advantages of 
the classical and separate equations structures while reducing the impact of 
their respective disadvantages. The interaction model preserves the simple 
calculations and straightforward interpretation of the classical model while 
allowing for the possibility that the factors determining compensation have 
different effects on compensation between the protected and nonprotected 
groups. It allows for the direct estimation of protected group effects on com-
pensation, as well as an estimation of how factors explaining compensation 
contribute differently to the compensation of different protected groups.
Formally, the interactive model of pay equity takes the following structure:

The interaction terms—the factors determining compensation multiplied by 
the dummy variable representing protected group status—are known as cross-
products. Assuming that the dummy variable representing protected group 
status is coded as 1 for protected employees and 0 for nonprotected employ-
ees, these cross-products enter the equation for observations for protected 
employees but not for those observations for nonprotected employees.19
19This is because any number multiplied by 0 is equal to 0.

Chapter 5 | Regression Models of Equal Pay 
134
Returning to the previous example regarding compensation of college pro-
fessors, and assuming we are interested in examining the effect of race on  
compensation, the interaction model is given by Equation 5.10:

This model provides estimates of the individual effects of the factors deter-
mining compensation (semesters of seniority, semesters of prior teaching 
experience, the number of courses currently taught, the number of disserta-
tion students supervised during the current semester, and educational attain-
ment) on compensation, irrespective of race, via

In essence, this is equivalent to estimating two separate equations and allow-
ing the factors determining compensation to affect compensation differently 
by protected group status.
Finally, the model estimates the effect of race on compensation, controlling for 
the effects of semesters of seniority, semesters of prior teaching experience, 
number of courses currently taught, number of dissertation students super-
vised during the current semester, and educational attainment, both overall 
and by race, via the 
6

estimated.

Interpretation of the results generated from the interactive model structure 
is very similar to interpretation of the classical model. For example, from 
Figure 5-5 we see that one semester of seniority is worth, on average, $1,992, 
all else equal. Based on the calculated probability value of 0.002, this effect is 
statistically significant. We would infer that seniority is a statistically significant 
predictor of compensation within this similarly situated employee grouping.
The effect of the cross-product of seniority and race on compensation is $54. 
This means that on average, one semester of seniority is worth an additional 
$54 for a nonwhite professor than for a white professor, all else equal. However, 
this effect is not statistically significant. The associated probability value of 0.393 
indicates that chance is the likely explanation for the observed difference.
The only cross-product that is statistically significant is the interaction of race 
and semesters of prior experience. Based on the regression results shown 
in Figure  5-5, we see that the estimated coefficient of this cross-product 
is –$695. This means that on average, one semester of prior experience is 
worth $695 less for a nonwhite professor than for a white professor, all else 
equal. This effect is statistically significant; the associated probability value is 
0.020. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the employer may 
be engaging in race discrimination by valuing prior experience for whites and 
nonwhites differently.
The interaction model is useful because it allows for the direct estimation 
of protected group effects while simultaneously allowing each factor explain-
ing compensation to differ in its effect on compensation by protected group 
status. The main disadvantage of this model is that because the number of 
explanatory variables is nearly double that of the classical model structure, a 
larger sample size is required.
The Overall Equity Model
The three model structures presented thus far are used primarily for detect-
ing compensation discrimination. As such, they all classify individuals within the 
similarly situated employee grouping on the basis of protected group status. 
Classifying individuals by protected group status is necessary for examining ques-
tions of compensation discrimination on the basis of protected group status.
However, classification in this manner may generate little, if any, information 
about pay inequities within protected group status. For example, to assess 
whether similarly situated white men are paid equitably, an alternative model 
structure ignoring protected group status may be more useful.
One such alternative model structure is the overall equity model structure. 
This structure examines residuals for all individuals within the similarly situ-
ated employee grouping, providing insight into whether employees are under- or 
overpaid vis-à-vis their comparators.

Chapter 5 | Regression Models of Equal Pay 
136
The overall equity model structure is similar to the classical model structure, 
with the exception that no dummy variables representing protected group 
status are included. Formally, the overall equity model of pay equity takes the

This structure expresses compensation as a function of the determinants of 
compensation (seniority, time in job, education, prior relevant work experi-
ence, performance ratings, etc.) and assumes that this functional relationship 
is the same for all individuals within the similarly situated employee grouping, 
irrespective of protected group status. 
The model is estimated via multiple regression, just like the classical, separate 
equations, and interactive model structures. Similar to the separate equations 
approach, the estimated model structure is used to calculate residuals for all 
individuals within the similarly situated employee grouping. The residuals are 
examined for directionality (positive or negative) and magnitude. Sufficiently 
large positive or negative residuals may indicate situations of inequity within 
the similarly situated employee grouping. 
To see how the overall equity model is applied, consider the following example. 
Assume that we are interested in examining the similarly situated employee 
grouping of college professors for overall pay equity. Further assume that

Figure 5-6 provides the regression output when compensation is estimated 
for all individuals within the similarly situated employee grouping as a function 
of semesters of seniority, semesters of prior teaching experience, the number 
of courses currently taught, the number of dissertation students supervised 
during the current semester, and the professor’s educational attainment.
This estimated model is then used to fit each employee’s compensation.20 The 
results of this fitting process are given in Table 5-6. 
20This fitting process is the same as that discussed in the separate equations approach.
On review of the differences between actual and predicted salaries shown in 
Table 5-6, three employees stand out: John Wilson, Jane Smith, and William 
Hobbs. Wilson’s annual salary is $70,000. When the estimated model is fitted 
using his employment characteristics, his predicted compensation is $58,780. 
The difference between his actual and predicted salary amounts is $11,220—he 
is earning $11,220 more than would be expected based on his employment 
characteristics.

Chapter 5 | Regression Models of Equal Pay 
138
Smith and Hobbs, on the other hand, are earning less than would be expected 
based on their employment characteristics. Smith is earning nearly $13,000 
a year less and Hobbs is earning nearly $14,000 a year less than would be 
expected based on the estimated model and employment characteristics.
When we look at Hobbs’s current salary and characteristics, we see that he 
is closest to Taylor (in terms of current salary and characteristics). Table 5-7 
shows salary and employment characteristics for both professors.
Table 5-7.  Employment Characteristics for William Hobbs and Michael Taylor

As can be seen, both Hobbs and Taylor are currently earning $48,000 per year. 
Both have four semesters of seniority, three or more semesters of prior expe-
rience, and are currently teaching an average course load. However, they differ 
in that Hobbs holds a Ph.D., whereas Taylor is ABD; Hobbs is also supervising 
more Ph.D. students than Taylor is.
Based on this direct comparison, we would expect that Hobbs’s annual salary 
would exceed that of Taylor (because Hobbs has a higher level of educational 
attainment and is supervising more Ph.D. students). In fact, they are both earn-
ing an annual salary of $48,000. 
Based on the results of the overall equity model, there is reason to believe 
that Hobbs is underpaid relative to his similarly situated counterparts. Had 
the analysis focused on conventional definitions of protected group sta-
tus based on gender, race and ethnicity, and so on, the possibility of Hobbs 
being underpaid by nearly $14,000 a year may have remained undiscovered.  
As noted in Chapter 1, any inequity in compensation, irrespective of protected 
group status, can be problematic. The overall equity model is particularly use-
ful for detecting these inequitable situations and for improving overall internal 
pay equity.

Other Models
The models presented in this chapter represent those most commonly used 
in the context of compensation discrimination and internal pay equity analysis. 
The discussion is by no means exhaustive, and it is not intended to be ency-
clopedic in scope. The models presented are intended to provide the reader 
with an overview of some of the basic structures used to examine questions 
of compensation discrimination and internal pay equity.
The choice of model structure will depend on the goals of the analysis, the 
context in which the analysis is being conducted, and how compensation is 
determined. Statistical consultants are best positioned to choose the appro-
priate model structure for the pay equity question(s) under investigation.

Other Tests of 
Equal Pay
Although multiple regression analysis is the preferred statistical technique 
for examining questions of internal pay equity, a variety of other statisti-
cal and nonstatistical techniques are often used. Some common tools for 
examining disparate treatment in compensation include a comparison of 
means and medians, t-tests, cohort analyses, and tipping point and threshold 
tests.
Questions of disparate impact in compensation are frequently examined within 
the context of contingency tables. Common tools for evaluating contingency 
tables include the four-fifths rule, chi square test, Fisher’s exact test, and the 
Mantel-Haenszel test. Logistic regression, a special form of multiple regression, 
can also be useful in evaluating the presence or absence of disparate impact 
as it relates to compensation.
Other Disparate Treatment Tests
The majority of other statistical and nonstatistical tests for disparate treat-
ment in compensation focus on comparing aggregate descriptive statistics, 
such as means and medians, by protected group status for a given employee 
grouping. One technique, however, focuses on comparing individual com-
pensation data points by protected group status within a given employee 
grouping.

*Flagged as potential problem area for discrimination.
Comparison of Means and Medians
As mentioned in Chapter 3, our first inclination when looking for the presence 
or absence of discrimination in pay data may be to turn to a comparison of 
average rates of pay for different groups. The calculations involved are simple, 
and interpretation is straightforward. Frequently businesses—and regulatory 
agencies—follow this inclination and base an assessment of compensation 
discrimination on a comparison of means.1
Sometimes, this comparison is extended to include a comparison of medians. 
The median is the numerical value separating the upper and lower halves of a 
data set. The median is found by arranging all of the observations from low-
est value to highest value and selecting the middle number. If there is an even 
number of observations, there will be no middle number; in this case, the 
median is calculated as the mean of the middle two numbers.
The comparison of means and medians is typically done by protected  
group status (male versus female, white versus nonwhite, etc.) for a group of 
“similar” employees.2 Example comparisons of mean and median compensation 
by gender by pay grade are given in Table 6-1 and Table 6-2, respectively.3

analysis report produced by Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).

In the example comparison of means given in Table 6-1, pay grades 5, 6, and 9 
would be flagged as potential problem areas for discrimination under the 
methodology used by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs 
(OFCCP) and other regulatory agencies. In the example comparison of   
medians given in Table 6-2, pay grades 5 and 6 would be flagged as potential 
problem areas for discrimination. 
Note that this flagging for potential discrimination is based solely on a positive 
difference between male and female average compensation. Under this meth-
odology, no consideration is given to statistical significance or practical signifi-
cance. Even though the differences of $33 per year and $24 per year between 
average compensation for men and women in pay grades 5 and 9, respectively, 
are not practically significant (and would likely not be statistically significant 
either), this analysis flags these two pay grades for potential discrimination. 
As noted in Chapter 3, however, a comparison of simple average or median 
compensation by protected group status cannot account for legitimate, non-
discriminatory factors that affect compensation. Because of this, in most cases 
a simple comparison of average or median compensation cannot provide an 
appropriate assessment of the presence or absence of discrimination.
One additional problem associated with a comparison of average compensa-
tion by protected group status is that averages can be influenced by extreme 
observations. To see how this happens, consider the two distributions of 
compensation shown in Table 6-3.

As can be seen from Table 6-3, both distributions have mean compensation 
of $74,000. When we look at the individual compensation amounts, however, 
we see that there are dramatic differences. Employees 101–105 are all paid 
the same salary: $74,000. The average rate of compensation for employees 
201–205 is also $74,000, but this average is influenced by employee 205, 
who is paid an annual salary of $250,000. If employee 205 were removed 
from the analysis, the average annual salary for employees 201–204 would 
be $30,000. Looking only at the averages for these two groups of employ-
ees masks the variation in compensation among employees 201–205. Based 
solely on the average rates of pay, one may conclude that there is no dif-
ference in the annual salaries of these two groups. If, however, employee 
205 was removed from the analysis, a completely different picture emerges. 
Because of the manner in which means are calculated, this issue cannot be 
avoided.
t-Test
As previously noted, a simple comparison of means is an informal test, because 
no consideration is given to the issue of statistical significance. There is, how-
ever, a formal test for assessing whether a difference in means is statistically 
significant. This test is known as the t-test.4 The t-test is a commonly used tool 
for testing the hypothesis that the sample means of two groups are equal.

4The t-test was introduced in 1908 by William Sealy Gossett. Gossett developed the test 
as an inexpensive way to monitor the quality of stout while working as a chemist at the 
Guinness brewery in Dublin, Ireland. The test was published in Biometrika in 1908 under 
the pen name Student because his employer considered the fact that statistics were being 
used in Guinness brewing as a trade secret.

In the context of internal pay equity, the null hypothesis would be that the 
average rates of pay for protected and nonprotected employees are the same, 
whereas the alternate hypothesis would be that the average rates of pay for 
protected and nonprotected employees are different.
There are a variety of forms of the t-test that make differing assumptions 
about how the samples were drawn and the sampling variances of each group. 
For example, different forms of the t-test are warranted when examining 
paired samples versus overlapping samples.6 The form assuming independent 
samples is most commonly used for performing t-tests within the context of 
compensation analysis.7
Within the independent samples form, there are two variants that differ 
based on the assumption one makes about the variances of the two groups 
being studied. The first variant assumes equal variance of the groups and 
5Note that this expresses the null and alternate hypotheses for a two-tailed test. In a one-
tailed test, the alternate hypothesis is constructed such that the sample mean for the second 
group is either (a) greater than or (b) less than the sample mean for the first group:

  The choice of one-tailed or two-tailed test depends on the question being addressed.
6The assumption of paired samples is appropriate when comparing matched pairs of 
observations, or “before” and “after” observations on the same group of individuals. 
Paired samples are sometimes referred to as “dependent samples.” The assumption of 
overlapping samples is used in the case of paired samples with missing data in one of the 
samples.
7The independent samples t-test is used when two separate sets of independent and 
identically distributed samples are drawn, one from each of the two populations under 
comparison. Within the context of internal pay equity, we are looking at, for example, 
annual pay rates for protected group members and nonprotected group members.

uses a pooled variance. The second variant allows for differing variances of  
the groups.8

nonrejection implies support for the null hypothesis. Snijders argues that nonrejection 
should be interpreted as an undecided outcome; there is not enough evidence to reject 
the null hypothesis, but this does not mean that there is evidence for it. T. A. B. Snijders,

If the calculated t-statistic is greater than or equal to the critical value obtained 
from the Student’s t-distribution, then we reject the null hypothesis, and infer 
that the means of the groups are different. If the calculated t-statistic is less 
than the critical value, then we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the 
means of the two groups are the same.
Calculation
To see how the t-test can be used to examine differences in average rates of  
pay for different groups, consider the following example. We are interested in 
examining total annual compensation for differences by gender among a group 
of 590 employees. Of them, 470 are male and 120 are female. The average 
total annual compensation for male employees is $117,408.17, and the average 
total annual compensation for female employees is $107,982.62. The differ-
ence in average total annual compensation for men and women is $9,425.55. 
The t-test will assess whether this difference is statistically significant.
Table 6-4 provides a sample of the output produced by a statistical software 
package when a t-test is performed using the data described.10
10The exact format and layout of the output, including what summary statistics are included, 
varies by software. The sample output in Table 6-4 is intended to illustrate the nature of 
information commonly provided by most packages.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
149
As can be seen, two different t-tests were performed: one assuming separate 
variances and one using a pooled variance (which assumes equal variances).11 
Irrespective of the assumption regarding sample variance, the t-tests indicate 
that the difference of $9,425.55 in annual total compensation by gender is 
statistically significant. Assuming separate variances, the calculated t-statistic is 
equal to –4.725, with an associated p-value of 0.000.12 Based on this p-value, 
we would conclude that the difference of $9,425.55 is statistically significant. 
Assuming equal variances, the calculated t-statistic is equal to –4.185, with an 
associated p-value of 0.000. Again, based on this p-value, we would conclude 
that the difference of $9,425.55 is statistically significant.

11It is not uncommon for statistical software to generate results for both t-tests. Some 
also provide a calculation of Levene’s test to assist in interpreting which assumption is 
appropriate.
12As discussed in Chapter 3, the p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at 
least as extreme as the one actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

Chapter 6 | Other Tests of Equal Pay
150
There are several advantages to t-tests. First, unlike a simple comparison 
of mean compensation by protected group status, a t-test allows one to associ-
ate a probability value with the difference, making an assessment of statistical 
significance possible. Second, t-tests are relatively easy to calculate and are a 
standard feature of statistical software packages. This makes them accessible to 
a wide range of users. Finally, the interpretation of results is straightforward.
The main disadvantage of t-tests, in the context of internal pay equity, is that 
like simple comparisons of mean compensation by protected group status, 
t-tests cannot account for legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors that affect 
compensation within similarly situated employee groupings. 
Tipping Points and Threshold Tests
Tipping points and threshold tests are another kind of nonstatistical test  
frequently used to assess internal pay equity. The idea behind tipping points 
and threshold tests is that if differences in compensation by protected group 
status exceeds a certain threshold—either in percentage terms or in absolute 
dollars—then compensation discrimination is suspected.
These kinds of tests were popularized by OFCCP. Prior to 2010, OFCCP 
used tipping point tests based on simple mathematical calculations. Under this 
methodology, a federal contractor would fail the tipping point test of internal 
pay equity if each of the following conditions were found in its compensation 
data:
1.	 A 5% or larger difference in pay between protected 
and nonprotected employees grouped by job title;
2.	 At least thirty protected employees are in employed 
in the job titles favoring nonprotected employees;
3.	 The number of protected employees employed 
in the job titles favoring nonprotected employees 
represents at least 10% of the total number of 
protected individuals in the contractor’s affirmative 
action plan;
4.	 The percentage of protected employees in job titles 
favoring nonprotected employees is at least three 
times the percentage of nonprotected employees in 
job titles favoring protected employees.
To see how this tipping point test is performed, consider the following  
example. Assume that a contractor’s workforce is employed across five  
different job titles, and headcounts and average hourly rates of pay by gender 
are those shown in Table 6-5.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
151
As can be seen, all job titles except Title E favor men (that is, the average hourly 
pay rate for men is greater than the average hourly pay rate for women). 
Using the tipping point methodology, Titles A, B, and C satisfy criterion 1. 
There are seventy-two women employed in job titles that favor men; this 
satisfies criterion 2. Criterion 3 is also satisfied: seventy-two out of eighty-
two women, or 87.8% of the total female workforce, work in job titles that 
favor men. Finally, the percentage of the total female workforce employed in 
jobs favoring females is 12.2%. Since 87.8% is more than three times 12.2%,  
criterion 4 is satisfied. Based on these results, OFCCP would move forward 
with a compensation audit on the basis of suspected compensation discrimi-
nation against women.
As noted by Jana Moberg, in 2010 contractors noticed that OFCCP was 
inconsistently analyzing compensation data. At the 2010 National Industry 
Liaison Meeting, OFCCP publicly denied ever using the tipping point test and 
refused to respond to requests from contractors asking for identification of 
compensation screening procedures.13
In summer 2010, it is believed that OFCCP released a new directive internally, 
giving the agency’s compliance officers new guidance on reviewing compensa-
tion data for potential discrimination. Under this new guidance, OFCCP will 
move forward with a compensation audit if pay differences of $2,000 or 2% in 
average compensation in at least one job grouping are found.
To see how this new $2,000/2% test differs from the tipping point test, con-
sider the following example. Assume that a contractor’s workforce is employed 
across five different job titles, and headcounts and average hourly rates of pay 
by gender are those shown in Table 6-6.

As can be seen, all job titles except Title E favor women (that is, the average 
compensation for women exceeds the average compensation for men).
Using the pre-2010 tipping point methodology, Title A has a 5% or larger dif-
ference in pay in favor of women; this satisfies criterion 1. There are seventy-
five men employed in job titles that favor women; this satisfies criterion 2. 
Criterion 3 is also satisfied: seventy-five out of eighty men, or 93.8% of the 
total male workforce, work in job titles that favor women. Finally, the percent-
age of the total male workforce employed in jobs favoring females is 6.3%. 
Since 93.8% is more than three times 6.3%, criterion 4 is satisfied. Based on 
these results, OFCCP would move forward with a compensation audit on the 
basis of suspected compensation discrimination against men.
In contrast, when the same data are reviewed using the $2,000/2% tipping 
point test, Titles A, B, C, and D satisfy the test criteria treating men as the 
protected group. Interestingly, Title E also satisfies the test criteria treating 
women as the protected group. Based on this data set and the application of 
the $2,000/2% tipping point test, OFCCP would move forward with a com-
pensation audit on the basis of suspected compensation discrimination against 
women and men.
The main problem with tipping points and threshold tests is that they are 
arbitrary in nature and lack scientific basis. 
Cohort Analysis
All of the previous tools study compensation in the aggregate for a particular 
group of employees, meaning that summary statistics such as medians and 
means for different groups of employees are compared.
Cohort analysis is a nonstatistical technique that qualitatively compares the 
compensation of similarly situated employees to identify the cause(s) of pay 
differences. Conventional application of cohort analysis is to identify poten-
tial explanations for differences in compensation by gender, race, or other

protected characteristic. Within this context, the analysis compares the   
compensation of the lowest paid protected member of one group with the 
compensation of his or her comparators.14 The purpose of the comparison   
is to determine whether there are factors other than protected status that 
may account for differences in pay.
For example, assume that we are interested in examining compensation by 
gender among those individuals employed as Customer Service Rep III in Pay 
Grade 21. These employees’ compensation is determined by total company 
tenure, time in job, and performance. Table 6-7 provides an example of a 
cohort analysis by gender among those employees.
As shown, the female employee, Sarah, earns $4,043 less than the male com-
parator James and $3,860 less than the male comparator Bennett. A review of 
these three workers’ tenure and time in job reveals that Sarah has longer ten-
ure and more time in job than either of the two male comparators. All three 
have identical performance ratings for the current and previous year.
Given that Sarah has longer tenure and greater time in job and performance 
ratings equal to the male comparators, we would expect her compensation to 
be greater than the two male comparators. The opposite, however, is true.
Cohort analysis can be a useful tool when the groupings of similarly situated 
employees are too small for formal statistical analysis. For example, assuming 
that the three people shown in Table 6-7 represent the totality of this simi-
larly situated employee grouping, it would not be mathematically possible to

14 Here, comparators are defined as nonprotected individuals who receive greater 
compensation than the protected individual but have what appears to be less qualifying 
experience, time in job, education, and so on.

estimate a regression in which compensation is a function of gender, tenure, 
time in job, and performance ratings in the current year and past year.15 A cohort 
analysis is a reasonable alternative to multiple regression analysis in the event 
that small sample sizes or other issues prevent multiple regression analysis.
Cohort analysis can also be a very useful method of follow-up for any statisti-
cally significant differences in compensation between two groups of similarly 
situated employees identified by multiple regression analysis.16
Note that although cohort analysis traditionally has been used within the 
context of protected versus nonprotected status, it can be a useful tool for 
examining overall equity. Rather than defining the set of possible comparators 
as those nonprotected individuals who are receiving greater compensation 
than the protected individual in question but have what appears to be less 
qualifying experience, time in job, education, and so on, possible comparators 
could be defined as those people who are of the same gender, race, age, and 
so on, who receive greater compensation than the individual in question but 
have what appears to be less qualifying experience, time in job, education, and 
so on. Using cohort analysis in this way would allow the identification of men, 
for example, who are underpaid relative to other similarly situated men.
Disparate Impact Models
Questions of disparate impact examine whether a challenged employment 
policy or practice has a disproportionate effect on different groups of people. 
Both the effect of the employment policy or practice and the groups of indi-
viduals being studied can be expressed in terms of a dichotomous variable.17
The outcomes of the challenged policy or practice can be framed in terms 
of a yes/no question, such as “eligible for bonus” and “not eligible for bonus.” 
Typically, the effect of the challenged employment policy or practice on 
two different groups will be examined: protected and nonprotected. In this 
case, protected status can be expressed in terms of yes (protected) or no 
(nonprotected).
15As discussed in Chapter 3, if the number of independent variables exceeds the number 
of observations, there are insufficient degrees of freedom and it is not mathematically 
possible to generate coefficient estimates.
16The use of cohort analysis for follow-up is discussed in Chapter 7.
17A dichotomous variable takes on one of two possible values (e.g., gender: male or 
female).

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
155
If both the outcome of the challenged policy or practice and protected  
group membership can be expressed in terms of a dichotomous variable, 
then the disparate impact question can be framed in terms of a two-by-two 
contingency table.18
A two-by-two contingency table cross-classifies observations across two  
variables. Each cell in the table contains the counts of the combinations of the 
two variables:
Outcome 1
Outcome 2
Protected
A
B
Nonprotected
C
D
The counts within the contingency table are interpreted as follows:
A = number of protected individuals experiencing employ-
• 
ment outcome 1;
B = number of protected individuals experiencing employ-
• 
ment outcome 2;
C = number of nonprotected individuals experiencing 
• 
employment outcome 1;
D = number of nonprotected individuals experiencing 
• 
employment outcome 2.
Both the employment outcomes and groups are mutually exclusive; that is,  
a person cannot belong to both the protected and nonprotected groups, 
nor can a person experience both employment outcomes 1 and 2. 
For example, assume we are looking at the number of female employees who 
are eligible to participate in a bonus program. Females would be considered 
protected and males would be considered nonprotected. Those eligible to 
participate in the bonus program would experience employment outcome 1, 
and those not eligible to participate in the bonus program would experience 
employment outcome 2. 
The groups are mutually exclusive, because an employee cannot be both male 
and female at the same time. The employment outcomes are also mutually 
exclusive, because an employee cannot be eligible and ineligible to participate 
in the bonus program simultaneously.
18There are statistical tests designed to examine tables larger than two by two (e.g., three 
by three, two by n). The current discussion is limited to two-by-two contingency tables.

The Four-Fifths Rule
The predominant nonstatistical method for examining questions of disparate 
impact is known as the four-fifths rule.19 This rule, also known as the 80% rule, 
is described by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as 
follows:
A selection rate for any race, sex or ethnic group which is less than four-
fifths (4/5) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with the highest 
rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement authorities 
as evidence of disparate impact, while a greater than four-fifths rate will 
generally not be regarded by Federal enforcement agencies as evidence 
of disparate impact.
Origin of the Four-Fifths Rule
The four-fifths rule was originally framed in 1971 by the Technical Advisory 
Committee on Testing (TACT). Assembled by the State of California Fair 
Employment Practice Commission (FEPC), TACT consisted of a panel of 
thirty-two professionals from various labor, employment and technical fields. 
TACT was tasked with outlining the specific methodology for evaluating dis-
parate impact. The four-fifths rule was the methodology they proposed for 
disparate impact analysis.
The origin of this rule was described by one of the committee members as 
follows:
During the negotiations of the FEPC Guidelines (which went on for months), 
one session had a significant debate on an appropriate statistical tool for 
determining adverse impact. We wanted to put an operational definition to 
some words defining what constituted adverse impact. There were about 
twenty of the committee members in the room. The members agreed 
that a statistical test was appropriate, but not enough. They also agreed 
that those who would implement these guidelines (the FEPC consultants) 
would never have the appropriate training to implement statistical tests 
(prior to the common use of computers, calculating probability statistics 
was a difficult task only completed by the technically savvy). Therefore, we 
needed an administrative guideline as well as a technical one for cases. 
I recall a heated debate that went on for way too long (as usual) with 
two camps: a 70% camp and a 90% camp. The 80% Test was born out 
19Ramona Paetzhold and Steven Willborn, The Statistics of Discrimination: Using Statistical 
Evidence in Discrimination Cases, Thompson/West (2006).

157
of two compromises: (1) a desire expressed by those writing and having 
input into the Guidelines to include a statistical test as the primary step 
but knowing from an administrative point of view a statistical test was not 
possible for the FEPC consultants who had to work the enforcement of 
the Guidelines, and (2) a way to split the middle between two camps, the 
70% camp and the 90% camp. A way was found to use both. In the way 
the 80% Test was defined by TACT, if there was no violation of the 80% 
Test, then there would be no reason to apply statistical significance tests. 
This hopefully would eliminate many calculations and many situations 
where TACT would not be necessary and the decision could be made 
in the field. So from a practical point of view, the 80% Test became a 
first step. If there was no 80% Test violation, there was no need to go 
further and use a statistical test. If there was a violation of the 80% 
Test, statistical significance was needed and the 80% Test then became a 
practical significance test for adverse impact.20
The four-fifths rule was published by the FEPC in October 1972 and was later 
codified in the 1978 Uniform Guidelines for Employee Selection Procedures 
(UGESP), which is used by the EEOC, Department of Labor, and Department 
of Justice in enforcing the nondiscrimination requirements of Title VII.
Calculation
As laid out in the UGESP, disparate impact is determined by a four-step 
calculation:
1.	 Calculate the rate of selection for each group—divide 
the number of persons selected from a group by  
the total number of persons in that group;
2.	 Observe which group has the highest selection rate;
3.	 Calculate the impact ratios by dividing the selection 
rate for a group by the selection rate for the highest 
group;
4.	 Observe whether the selection rate for any group 
is substantially less (i.e., usually less than 4/5 or 80%) 
than the selection rate for the highest group. If it is, 
disparate impact is indicated in most circumstances.

Employment Testing (Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2006), 3.

The actual calculations proceed as follows. Assume that we are interested in 
applying the four-fifths rule to assess whether the eligibility requirements for 
an incentive pay program have a disparate impact by race among a group of 
10,000 employees. Of those, 5,000 are white and 5,000 are nonwhite. Further 
assume that 4,500 white and 4,000 nonwhite employees satisfy the eligibility 
requirements.
The contingency table for this example is as follows.
Eligible
Not Eligible
Nonwhite
A
4,000
B
1,000
White
C
4,500
D
500
The eligibility rates for whites and nonwhites are calculated as follows:
Nonwhite Eligibility Rate
White Eligibility Rate
= A / (A + B)
= C / (C + D)
= 4,000 / (4,000 + 1,000)
= 4,500 / (4,500 + 500)
= 4,000 / 5,000
= 4,500 / 5,000
= 80%
= 90%
Ratio of Eligibility Rates:
80% / 90% = 89%
In this example, because the ratio of eligibility rates is 89% (which is greater 
than four-fifths, or 80%), we would infer that the eligibility requirements do 
not have a disparate impact by race.
Limitations of the Four-Fifths Rule
The four-fifths rule is a relatively straightforward calculation and is easy to 
implement. Because of this, it has gained popularity for determining disparate 
impact in employment discrimination matters. However, there are three seri-
ous limitations of the rule that make it less than ideal for assessing disparate 
impact.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
159
Insensitivity to Sample Size
First, the four-fifths rule is insensitive to sample size. It does not take into 
account the number of decisions being studied. To see why this matters, con-
sider the following example. 
We are interested in applying the four-fifths rule to assess whether the eligibil-
ity requirements for an incentive pay program have a disparate impact by race 
among a group of six employees: three whites and three nonwhites. All three 
white employees and two of the three nonwhite employees satisfy the eligibility 
requirements. The contingency table for this example is as follows.
Eligible
Not Eligible
Nonwhite
A
2
B
1
White
C
3
D
0
The eligibility rates for whites and nonwhites are calculated as follows.
Nonwhite Eligibility Rate
White Eligibility Rate
= A / (A + B)
= C / (C + D)
= 2 / (2 + 1)
= 3 / (3 + 0)
= 2 / 3
= 3 / 3
= 67%
= 100%
Ratio of Eligibility Rates:
67% / 100% = 67%
In this example, the ratio of eligibility rates is 67% (less than four-fifths, or 
80%), so we would infer that the eligibility requirements do have a disparate 
impact by race. However, because of the small sample size of six employees, 
the observed result could have occurred due to chance. In fact, this disparity is 
equivalent to approximately 1.1 units of standard deviation. This is well below 
the “two or three units” standard of statistical significance. If we were using a 
formal statistical tool to examine these eligibility rates by race, we would not 
infer that disparate impact existed.
Going back to the original example of 5,000 nonwhites and 5,000 whites, we 
saw that the eligibility ratio was 89%. Based on the four-fifths rule, we inferred 
that no disparate impact by race existed. However, the disparity in this example 

Chapter 6 | Other Tests of Equal Pay
160
is equivalent to approximately fourteen units of standard deviation, well above 
the threshold of two or three units.
As discussed earlier, sample size affects statistical significance. By its very con-
struction, the four-fifths rule cannot account for sample size. In the example, 
the four-fifths rule led to the conclusion that disparate impact existed, whereas 
the statistical analysis indicated no disparate impact.
Insensitivity to Magnitude of Disparity
The four-fifths rule is insensitive to the magnitude of the disparity. To see why 
this matters, consider the following example. 
Assume that we are interested in applying the four-fifths rule to assess whether 
either of the two eligibility requirements for an incentive pay program has a 
disparate impact by race among a group of 10,000 nonwhite and 10,000 white 
employees. Assume that 7,000 nonwhites and 10,000 whites satisfy the first 
eligibility criterion, and that 7 nonwhites and 10 whites satisfy the second 
eligibility criterion. 
The contingency tables for these two eligibility criteria are as follows.
Eligibility Criterion 1
Eligible
Not Eligible
Nonwhite
A
7,000
B
3,000
White
C
10,000
D
0
The eligibility rates for whites and nonwhites for criterion 1 are calculated as 
follows.
Nonwhite Eligibility Rate
White Eligibility Rate
= A / (A + B)
= C / (C + D)
= 7,000 / (7,000 + 3,000)
= 10,000 / (10,000 + 0)
= 7,000 / 10,000
= 10,000 / 10,000
= 70%
= 100%
Ratio of Eligibility Rates:
70% / 100% = 70%

Eligibility Criterion 2

Not Eligible
Nonwhite
A
7
B
9,993
White

D
9,990
The eligibility rates for whites and nonwhites for criterion 2 are calculated as 
follows.
Nonwhite Eligibility Rate
White Eligibility Rate
= A / (A + B)
= C / (C + D)
= 7 / (7 + 9,993)
= 10 / (10 + 9,990)
= 7 / 10,000
= 10 / 10,000
= 0.07%
= 0.10%
Ratio of Eligibility Rates:
0.07% / 0.10% = 70%
Using the four-fifths rule, both eligibility criteria appear to be identical in that 
they both result in an eligibility ratio of 70%.
However, the criteria are quite different in terms of the number of nonwhite 
employees affected. Under criterion 1, there are 3,000 more nonwhite employ-
ees than white employees who have been adversely affected (i.e., did not satisfy 
eligibility requirements). Under criterion 2, there are three more nonwhite 
employees than white employees who have been adversely affected. Even 
though the eligibility rates of both criteria are the same (70%) there is certainly 
a difference of practical significance in the number of nonwhite employees 
affected (3,000 versus 3). The four-fifths rule cannot account for this.
Arbitrariness and Lack of Statistical Basis
The final shortcoming of the four-fifths rule is its arbitrariness and lack of 
statistical basis. The choice of four fifths, or 80%, has no scientific or empirical 
basis. In fact, as one of the TACT committee members stated, the choice of 
80% was simply a compromise between the 70% camp and the 90% camp.

Chapter 6 | Other Tests of Equal Pay
162
Though all threshold rules have some degree of arbitrariness, some are more 
arbitrary than others. For example, in Hazelwood School District v. United States 
(433 U.S. 299, 1977), the court determined that two or three units of stan-
dard deviation was considered to be statistically significant. The court could 
have chosen one unit, or five units, but they chose “two or three units.” This 
presumably is because these are the values associated with probabilities of 
5% and 1%, respectively, which are widely accepted within the statistics and 
social sciences communities. In the case of the four-fifths rule, there is no such 
general acceptance.
The arbitrary nature of the four-fifths rule has been questioned by U.S. courts 
since 1980. In fact, the EEOC suggested that a “more defensible standard” 
would be based on a comparison of the selection rate of a particular pro-
tected group with the rate that would occur if the organization simply selected 
people at random.
Formal Statistical Tests of Disparate Impact
The suggestion made by the EEOC of selecting people at random is essentially 
the basis of formal statistical tests of disparate impact. The central assump-
tion underlying all of the formal tests that are discussed in this section—
the chi square test, Fisher’s exact test, the Mantel-Haenszel test, and logistic 
regression—are all premised on the assumption of no relationship between 
protected status and the outcome of a given employment policy or practice.
The Central Assumption
When studying questions of disparate impact, the central assumption used is 
that if the challenged employment policy or practice is neutral with respect to 
protected status, then the rates for protected and nonprotected employees 
experiencing the same employment outcomes should be equal.
For example, if eligibility for a bonus program does not have a disparate impact 
by gender, then we would expect the percentage of men who are eligible for 
the program to be the same as the percentage of women who are eligible for 
the program. In other words, if 75% of men are eligible for the bonus program, 
we would expect that 75% of women would also be eligible for the bonus pro-
gram if the criteria for eligibility do not have a disparate impact by gender.
In this example, we would expect that the eligibility rates for men and women 
would be equal: 75%. The actual female eligibility rate for women may be 76% 
or 74%. We can use statistics to assess whether the protected group “success” 
rate is different from the nonprotected group “success” rate in a statistically 
meaningful way. There are numerous statistical tools that can perform this 
assessment.

163
Hypothesis Testing
In a disparate impact analysis, the expected “success” rate for protected group 
members is based on the assumption that under a neutral policy or practice, 
the success rates for protected and nonprotected people would be the same. 
In terms of a contingency table, the underlying assumption is that there is no 
association between the row variable (protected status) and the column vari-
able (employment outcome).
To statistically test this assumption, a hypothesis test is used. In the disparate 
impact context, the null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between 
protected status and the outcome of the challenged policy or practice. The 
alternate hypothesis is that such a relationship does exist.
If there is no statistically significant difference between the actual and expected 
outcomes experienced by protected and nonprotected individuals, the null 
hypothesis cannot be rejected. One would infer that the null hypothesis is 
true, and conclude that there is no relationship between protected status and 
the outcome of the challenged policy or practice.
If, however, there is a statistically significant difference between actual and 
expected outcomes experienced by protected and nonprotected individuals, 
the null hypothesis is rejected. One would infer that the alternate hypothesis 
is true and conclude that there is a relationship between protected status and 
the outcome of the challenged policy or practice.
Choosing an Appropriate Test Statistic
There are a variety of statistical tests that can be used to examine claims of 
disparate impact. Each implicitly contains some assumptions. Choosing the 
appropriate statistical test depends on the nature of the selection process. 
There are two basic forms of selection processes: those with a variable num-
ber of selections, and those with a fixed number of selections.
Within the compensation context, a common example of a process with a 
variable number of selections is participation in an incentive compensation 
plan. In the case where employees must meet some eligibility criteria, and 
what constitutes satisfaction of those criteria is determined prior to employee 
evaluation, the number of employees who satisfy those criteria is not fixed.21
It could be the case that 50% of employees are eligible to participate. It could 
just as easily be the case that 25% or 75% are eligible to participate. If the 
21 If the eligibility for participation was determined after reviewing employees’ eligibility 
criteria—for example, to ensure that 25% of employees were eligible for participation—
then the number of employees eligible for participation in the incentive compensation 
plan is fixed.

particular employment policy or practice being challenged has a variable suc-
cess rate, both the composition of successes (e.g., male versus female) and the 
overall number of successes can vary. When examining these kinds of policies 
and practices for disparate impact, the appropriate test statistic is based on 
the binomial distribution.22
In contrast, when there are a fixed number of overall successes, the appropri-
ate test statistic is based on the hypergeometric distribution.23 An example 
of this type of policy or practice within the compensation context might be 
a year-end bonus that is awarded to the top five salespersons based on rank-
ing those salespersons by total revenue generated during the calendar year. 
In this type of scenario, the composition of successes can vary (five men, four 
men and one woman, three men and two women, etc.), the overall number of 
successes is fixed.
Variable Number of Selections
The calculation of statistical significance in a process with a variable number 
of selections is based on the binomial distribution. To see how the calcula-
tion is performed, assume that we are interested in examining whether bonus 
eligibility criteria have a disparate impact by gender. Five hundred employees 
were evaluated, and of them, 125 satisfy the bonus eligibility criteria. Of those 
125 employees who are eligible, 20 are female and 105 are male, as shown in 
Table 6-8.

22The binomial distribution is the discrete probability distribution of the number of 
successes in a series of independent yes/no experiments, each of which has a probability 
of success equal to p. One common example of the binomial distribution is coin-flipping. 
You flip a coin 10 times. What is the probability of getting 6 heads in 10 flips? The 
binomial distribution is used to calculate the likelihood of seeing x heads out of n flips.
23The hypergeometric distribution is the discrete probability distribution that describes 
the probability of k successes in n draws without replacement. The common example 
used to illustrate the hypergeometric distribution is the “urn model”; you draw 10 
marbles from an urn containing 5 red and 20 blue marbles without putting any drawn 
marbles back into the urn (without replacement). What is the probability that exactly 4 
of the 10 marbles you draw are red? The hypergeometric distribution is used to calculate 
this probability.

As can be seen, the overall eligibility rate for all employees is 25%. The eligibility 
rate for men is 30%, and the eligibility rate for women is slightly more than 13%.
The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between gender and eligibil-
ity for participation. If the null hypothesis is true, then the difference between 
male and female eligibility rates will be statistically insignificant. The test for 
statistical significance is drawn from the binomial distribution. The formula for 
computing the z-statistic—the measure of units of standard deviation—of the 
difference in eligibility rates by gender is as follows:

To determine whether the difference in male and female eligibility rates is 
statistically significant, one examines the absolute value of the z-statistic. In 
this case, because the z-statistic (the units of standard deviation) is greater 
than the threshold of two units, we reject the null hypothesis of no relation-
ship between gender and eligibility. We infer that the eligibility criteria have a 
disparate impact with respect to gender.
This testing procedure is appropriate for any kind of employment policy or 
practice where there are a variable number of successes.
Fixed Number of Selections
The calculation of statistical significance in a process with a fixed number of 
selections is based on the hypergeometric distribution. To see how the cal-
culation is performed, imagine that we are interested in examining whether 
the selection process of fifty employees to receive a year-end bonus has a 
disparate impact by gender. Assume that 125 employees were considered for 
selection and 50 were actually selected. Further assume that among the 50 
selected, 10 were women and 40 were men, as shown in Table 6-9.
The overall selection rate for all employees is 40%. The selection rate for men 
is 38.1%, and that for women is 50%.
The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between gender and selec-
tion. If the null hypothesis is true, then the difference between male and female 
selection rates will be statistically insignificant. The test for statistical significance

case, because the z-statistic is less than the threshold of two units, we cannot 
reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between gender and selection. 
We infer that selection for year-end bonus does not have a disparate impact 
with respect to gender.
This testing procedure is appropriate for any kind of employment policy or 
practice where there are a fixed number of successes.
Chi Square Test
One of the most common formal statistical tools for hypothesis testing of dis-
parate impact within the contingency table framework is the chi square test. 
To illustrate how the it can be used to examine questions of adverse impact, 
we return to one of our previous examples of eligibility for participation in an 
incentive compensation program.

Based on this comparison, we see that 250 fewer nonwhite employees were 
eligible than would have been expected under a race-neutral process.
To assess whether this difference is statistically significant, and thus determine 
whether an inference of disparate impact by race is warranted, the chi square 
test statistic is used.
The chi square test statistic is calculated as the sum of squares of the differ-
ence between the actual (A) and expected (E) counts divided by the expected 
count. Mathematically, the chi square test statistic is expressed as follows:
	
2

(
)
A

(6.8)
If there is no association between the column and row variables in the contin-
gency table—that is, if there is no association between race and eligibility—then 
the actual and expected counts will be equal or approximately equal. This will 
lead to a zero (or approximately zero) numerator, and the test statistic will be 
zero or very small. However, if there is an association between the column and 
row variables, the difference between actual and expected counts will be large, 
leading to a large numerator and a large calculated value of the test statistic.
The chi square test statistic follows a chi square distribution with one degree 
of freedom.24 A larger value of the test statistic results in a smaller probability 
of the actual outcome occurring due to chance. This smaller probability, in 
turn, translates into more units of standard deviation.
24A two-by-two contingency table has one degree of freedom. The number of values in 
the final calculation that are free to vary—that is, the number of independent pieces of 
information—is referred to as the degrees of freedom. In a two-by-two contingency 
table, if we know the row and column totals (in this case, the number of white and 
nonwhite employees and the numbers eligible and not eligible for participation), only one 
number—either A, B, C, or D—is required to fill in the remainder of the cells.

In this example, the calculated chi square test statistic is equal to 196.08. 
Based on this value, the probability of a difference of this size occurring under 
a race-neutral process is less than 0.0001. This probability, when translated 
into units of standard deviation, satisfies the “two or three units” standard set 
forth in Hazelwood.25
Because the disparity—the difference between actual and expected—is statisti-
cally significant, the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between race and 
eligibility would be rejected. One would infer that there is a relationship between 
race and eligibility, and therefore make an inference of disparate impact.
The advantage of using the chi square test to study contingency tables is that 
it is relatively simple to calculate. However, there are two main disadvantages 
of this test. It provides only an approximate probability. There are other tests, 
such as Fisher’s exact test, that provide an exact probability. Furthermore, the 
chi square test is inappropriate for small sample sizes.26 If the expected cell 
counts are small, Fisher’s exact test is preferred.
Fisher’s Exact Test
Fisher’s exact test is another formal statistical tool for hypothesis testing. The 
null hypothesis here is that the relative proportions of one variable (i.e., pro-
tected and nonprotected individuals) are independent of the second variable.
Fisher’s exact test is based on the hypergeometric distribution. It therefore 
assumes that the number of selections is fixed. It calculates the probability of 
seeing the actual outcomes, and all other outcomes with more extreme devia-
tions, under the null hypothesis.
To illustrate what is meant by “more extreme deviations,” assume that a study 
population consists of twenty individuals, ten of whom are protected and ten 
of whom are nonprotected. Further assume that ten of the twenty individuals 
will receive a year-end bonus based on their relative rankings with respect to 
a given criterion. When all individuals are ranked, three protected and seven 
nonprotected people are selected to receive the year-end bonus.
Based on the composition of the twenty employees with respect to pro-
tected status (i.e., 50% protected and 50% nonprotected) we would expect 
have expected five protected and five nonprotected individuals to be selected 
25The translation of the chi square test statistic into a probability, and hence into units 
of standard deviation, is not discussed here. Readers are encouraged to consult any 
elementary statistics text for a discussion of this translation process.
26In this context, a small sample size refers to an expected value in the contingency table 
cells of less than five.

(50% of all selections would be protected and 50% of all selections would be 
nonprotected). In this case, more “extreme deviations” from the expected 
outcome would be given by the following selections: 
two protected and eight nonprotected selections;
• 
one protected and nine nonprotected selections;
• 
zero protected and ten nonprotected selections.
• 
To illustrate how Fisher’s exact test can be used to examine questions of dis-
parate impact, assume a study population containing ten protected individuals 
and ten nonprotected individuals. Three protected and seven nonprotected 
individuals are selected for a positive employment outcome. The two-by-two 
contingency table for this example would be as follows.

The null hypothesis is essentially the same as in the chi square test: there is no 
relationship between protected status and the likelihood of being eligible. The 
expected number of eligible protected employees is calculated in the same 
way as previously discussed. Because 50% of the total population of employ-
ees is protected, one would expect 50% of the eligible employees—or a total 
of five people—to be protected individuals.
Unlike the chi square test, Fisher’s exact test has no test statistic; the  
probability is calculated directly. The probability is given by the following 
hypergeometric rule:27

the product of all positive integers less than or equal to N. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 
2 * 1 = 120.

Using this formula, the exact probability is equal to 0.3715. Because the prob-
ability is not small enough to be statistically significant, the null hypothesis 
that there is no relationship between protected status and the employment 
outcome cannot be rejected.28 One would infer that there is no relationship 
between protected status and the employment outcome. One would there-
fore not make an inference of disparate impact.
Mantel-Haenszel Test
The chi square and Fisher’s exact tests are useful in cases where selection 
decisions are examined as a group. If the selection decisions were made at 
one point in time, such as one evaluation of bonus eligibility, examining the 
decisions collectively in an aggregated analysis may be appropriate. It is often 
the case, however, that we want to study multiple occurrences of the same 
selection process. 
For example, assume that bonus eligibility is determined on a quarterly 
basis—that is, four times per calendar year. One could perform four separate 
statistical tests in which eligibility rates by protected group status are exam-
ined individually for each round of eligibility evaluation. Alternatively, the four 
rounds could be statistically combined together to assess whether a pattern 
of disparate impact over time exists.
The Mantel-Haenszel test can be used to statistically combine groups of selec-
tion events. The Mantel-Haenszel test statistic is calculated as the squared 
sum of deviations between observed and expected values divided by the 
estimate of variance of the squared differences. Note that 0.5 is subtracted 
from the squared sum of deviations between observed and expected values 
28To reject the null hypothesis, the probability would have to be less than or equal to 0.05 
under standard statistical assumptions.

The Mantel-Haenszel test statistic follows the chi square distribution with one 
degree of freedom.
To see how the Mantel-Haenszel test can be used, consider the following 
example. We are interested in examining whether a bonus eligibility criterion 
has a disparate impact by gender. Assume that the eligibility criterion was 
applied at four different times throughout the year. Further assume that the 
results of the eligibility analyses were as shown in Table 6-10.

The results of the four instances of the application of the eligibility criterion 
can be statistically combined via the Mantel-Haenszel test to determine if the 
eligibility criterion has a disparate impact on women over time.
In this example, the calculated Mantel-Haenszel test statistic is equal to 51.05. 
Based on this test statistic, the probability of these results occurring under a 
gender-neutral process is less than 0.0001. The units of standard deviation in 
this example satisfy the two or three units standard set forth in Hazelwood. 
There is a statistically significant shortfall of women eligible for the bonus—
that is, statistically significantly fewer women are eligible for the bonus than 
would be expected under a gender-neutral process.
Because the female shortfall is statistically significant, the null hypothesis that 
there is no relationship between gender and the likelihood of being eligible 
for the bonus is rejected. One would infer that there is a relationship between 
gender and the likelihood of bonus eligibility and that the eligibility criterion 
has a disparate impact with respect to gender. 
Logistic Regression
All of the test statistics discussed up to this point have focused on examining 
disparate impact within the context of a two-by-two contingency table. By 
definition, the two-by-two contingency table framework can only examine 
two variables at a time. In the context of disparate impact, a two-by-two con-
tingency analysis can only examine (1) protected group status and (2) selected 
or not selected.
There may be some cases in which one would want to incorporate more than 
just two dimensions of information. For example, assume that when selecting 
individuals for a year-end sales bonus, the decision maker considers each employ-
ee’s total annual sales, the percentage of target sales volume achieved, and the 
employee’s performance rating from the prior evaluation period. For the model 
to reflect the role that sales volume, percentage of target achieved, and perfor-
mance play in the selection process, it is necessary to move away from the two-
by-two contingency table framework and use a multiple regression analysis.
A multiple regression analysis examines the relationship between a depen-
dent variable and two or more independent variables. In this example, the 
dependent variable would be whether the employee was selected for the 
year-end sales bonus, and the independent variables would be protected 
group status, total annual sales, percentage of target sales volume achieved, 
and performance. 
There are numerous variations of the multiple regression model for the gen-
eral linear and nonlinear forms. When the question being investigated can be 
expressed as a binary dependent value—essentially a “yes” or “no” value—a 
special form of a generalized linear model can be used: the logistic model.

If one was interested in examining disparate impact with respect to gender of

Other Statistical Tests
The statistical tests described in this chapter represent some of the most 
commonly used statistical tools for examining adverse impact. This discussion 
is by no means exhaustive and is not intended to be encyclopedic in scope. 
The tests presented are intended to provide the reader with an introduction 
and overview to the kinds of statistical tools available, how those tools work, 
and how they can be applied within the context of disparate impact. 
Statistical consultants are best positioned to choose the appropriate statistical 
testing methodology for the disparate impact question(s) under investigation.

Analysis  
Follow-Up
Follow-through is the bridge between good planning and good results.
—Unknown
Analysis follow-up is a crucial step in the compensation review process.  
If the results of a given analysis indicate the possibility of a disparity, either by 
protected group status or within the context of overall equity, that disparity 
should be investigated. Without proper follow-up, the opportunities to learn 
from the analysis and correct potential problem areas are lost.
In fact, performing the analyses and then failing to follow up on the findings can 
do more harm than not conducting the analyses in the first place. Consider 
the case of Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (N.D. Cal. No C-01-2252). The lawsuit, 
filed in June 2001, was the largest gender discrimination suit in the history of 
the United States; the claim sought to represent 1.6 million women employed 
by Wal-Mart since December 26, 1998.1 
Six years before this suit was filed, Wal-Mart retained a well-known law firm 
to examine its vulnerability to gender discrimination claims. According to 
an article in the New York Times, the firm issued a report in 1995 indicating 
that female employees earned less than male employees in numerous job 
categories; women in salaried positions earned 19% less than their male

counterparts.2 Specific actions for remedying the widespread gender disparities 
in compensation at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores were recommended.3
According to the article:
The report, which [Wal-Mart] asserted was “confidential and privileged,” 
was made available to The New York Times by someone not involved in 
the lawsuit who said that Wal-Mart had not done enough to address the 
issues [the report] raised.4
As pointed out by Steven Greenhouse, “company documents and depositions 
in the lawsuit suggest that Wal-Mart’s initial adoption of the report’s recom-
mendations was fitful and incomplete.”5
Had Wal-Mart engaged in proper follow-up on the identified gender dispari-
ties in pay, the litigation—as well as the public relations problems created by 
the release of the report—may have been avoided.
The manner in which the follow-up investigation proceeds depends on several 
elements, including what factors determine compensation, how the compen-
sation decisions were made, and who made them, among others.
Typically, follow-up investigations begin with a deeper examination of the com-
pensation and employment characteristics data and analysis results, a review 
of personnel and employment files, an examination of current and historical 
performance rating information, and discussions with managers, supervisors, 
and human resources personnel.
Follow-up is important because it can reveal areas of potential discrimination 
and/or inequity, highlight structural flaws in the model of compensation, and 
identify deficiencies in data capture and document retention. For example, 
when speaking with a manager or supervisor about a potential pay disparity 
for a given similarly situated employee grouping, you may learn that some of 
the employees in that grouping were red circled.6 Red circling—rather than 
discrimination—may be the reason for what would appear to be a disparity. 
2Steven Greenhouse, “Report Warned Wal-Mart of Risks Before Bias Suit,” New York Times, 
June 3, 2010.
3The report also discussed specific recommendations for gender disparities in promotion 
rates that were identified by the analysis.
4Greenhouse, “Report Warned Wal-Mart of Risks.”
5Ibid.
6Red circling, also known as red lining, is maintaining an employee’s pay rate above the 
established range maximum for that employee’s classification. An employee’s pay rate may, 
at the discretion of management, be red circled when his or her position is downward 
reclassified and the current salary is above the pay range maximum for the new classification. 
Occurrences of red circling are most commonly found in cases of reclassification of jobs, 
personnel redeployment following a reduction in force, and so on.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
179
In this case, information regarding which employees in the grouping were red 
circled should be incorporated into the statistical model. The model should 
then be reestimated to assess how the incorporation of red-circle informa-
tion affected the estimated pay disparity.
A conversation with a manager or supervisor may also reveal that there 
are nondiscriminatory factors considered when making compensation deci-
sions that were not included in the original model because no information is 
recorded or maintained regarding these factors. This kind of conversation 
should be an impetus to begin collection and retention of the necessary data 
so that they can be incorporated in future examinations of compensation.
Before turning to a discussion of the various methods of follow-up investiga-
tion, it is important to have an understanding of how to identify which simi-
larly situated employee groupings require it. Groupings requiring follow-up 
are identified via analysis red flags and problem indicators.
Red Flags and Problem Indicators
Analysis red flags come in an array of forms. Some, like measures of statistical 
significance, are based in probability theory. Others, such as a collection of 
results across different groups of similarly situated employees that are direc-
tionally adverse to a given protected group, are pattern-driven. When examin-
ing the results of the compensation analysis, it is essential to consider and look 
for a variety of red flags. Relying solely on only one type of indicator is not 
recommended, because it can lull one into a false sense of security regarding 
pay equity and the risk of compensation discrimination litigation.
To facilitate the discussion of common red flags and problem indicators, and 
differences in the inferences they generate, a uniform data set will be used. 
Assume that we are interested in examining compensation for the presence of 
gender discrimination among ten similarly situated employee groupings.7 We 
are examining total annual compensation among those employees assigned 
to the sales department and hourly rates of pay among those employees 
assigned to the installation department. 
Our quantitative examination of pay for each similarly situated employee 
grouping will consist of multiple regression analysis. A review of the compen-
sation policies and practices for the sales department indicates that annual 
salary is based on an employee’s total company seniority, relevant prior expe-
rience, and performance, as shown in Equation 7.1:

The following data points are collected for all of the employees in each of the

ratings
Drivers, Installers, and Repair: hourly pay rate, 
seniority, performance ratings, and CDL status
Forklift Operations and Receiving: hourly pay 
rate, seniority, performance ratings, forklift certifica-
tion status
These data are then used to estimate ten regression models derived from 
Equations 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3, one for each similarly situated employee grouping. 
Table 7-1 represents the results of the multiple regression analyses.

and in terms of hourly pay rates for the installation department) from the

Statistical Significance
As mentioned in Chapter 3, statistical significance addresses the question of 
whether an observed outcome is “sufficiently rare” such that it is unlikely to 
occur due to chance variation. The statistical significance of the estimated 
gender effects shown in Table 7-1 is assessed via the t-statistics and p-values.

8In each of the equations, gender was represented by a dummy variable taking on a value 
of 1 for women and a value of 0 for men. Estimated gender effects that are negative are 
directionally adverse to women (there is a penalty for being female); estimated gender 
effects that are positive are directionally favorable to women (there is a premium for 
being female).

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up 
182
On reviewing the results presented in Table 7-1, we see that among the ten 
similarly situated employee groupings, only two of the estimated gender 
effects—call center agent and customer service representative—are statis-
tically significant. The estimated gender effect among call center agents is 
–$1,040 a year. Under a gender-neutral process, we would expect to see an 
estimated gender effect of –$1,040 or greater only 2.3% of the time over 
repeated sampling. We therefore infer that chance is not the likely explana-
tion for the difference in hourly pay rates by gender among call center agents 
and that some other process is at work. 
Similarly, the estimated gender effect among customer service representa-
tives is –$624 a year. Under a gender-neutral process, we would expect to see 
an estimated gender effect of –$624 or greater only 3.4% of the time over 
repeated sampling. We therefore infer that chance is not the likely explana-
tion for the difference in hourly pay rates by gender among customer service 
representatives and that some other process is at work.
It is important to keep in mind that, as noted in Chapter 5, we cannot auto-
matically infer that the statistically significant gender disparities among call 
center agents and customer service representatives are the result of gender 
discrimination. There are a variety of other potential explanations for the 
observed disparities. The purpose of follow-up investigations is to identify 
these potential explanations and assess their validity.
The estimated gender effects for the remaining eight similarly situated 
employee groupings are not statistically significant. As such, they are not sta-
tistically different from zero and are consistent with the hypotheses of gen-
der-neutral compensation practices. This does not mean, however, that we 
can automatically rule out the possibility of gender discrimination for these 
remaining groupings.
Consider, for example, the similarly situated employee grouping consisting of 
forklift operators. There are twenty individuals employed as forklift operators: 
nineteen men and one woman. As can be seen from Table 7-1, the estimated 
gender effect among forklift operators is –$1.00 per hour, but no measures 
of statistical significance (t-statistic and p-value) are calculated for this simi-
larly situated employee grouping. Calculation of these statistics is not possible 
because there is only one woman within the grouping.9
9Because there is only one female in the similarly situated employee grouping, there is 
only a single observation on which the estimated gender effect is based. Because of this, 
there is no variation among observations of the estimated gender effect. As a result, the 
t-statistic and its associated probability value cannot be calculated.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
183
Also consider the similarly situated employee grouping consisting of repair 
personnel. There are thirty-six people employed as repair personnel: thirty-
three men and three women. As can be seen from Table 7-1, the estimated 
gender effect among repair personnel is –$0.35 per hour, but it is not statisti-
cally significant; the associated probability value is 0.4237. This result should 
not be interpreted as indicative of no gender discrimination. One must keep 
in mind that statistical significance is a function of both the size of the dispar-
ity and the sample size.10 It is possible that the estimated gender effect failed 
to attain statistical significance because of the small number of women in this 
similarly situated grouping. One should not take comfort in an analysis indi-
cating no statistically significant disparities in pay by protected group status in 
cases of small sample sizes.
Practical Significance
In addition to reviewing statistical significance, one should also review the 
estimated gender effects for practical significance. As noted in Chapter 3, 
practical significance addresses the question of whether the estimated effect 
is big enough to matter.
Among the five similarly situated employee groupings within the sales depart-
ment, the estimated gender effects range from $312 to $1,040 a year. The 
estimated $312 differential by gender among pricing specialists is likely to be 
practically insignificant. Assuming that the average annual salaries for men and 
women are $36,712 and $36,400, respectively, the estimated differential is less 
than 1% of women’s salary in this similarly situated employee grouping.11 In 
most cases, this differential would not be practically significant.12
The estimated gender differential in annual salary among call center agents 
is $1,040. This differential is likely to be practically significant. Assuming 
that the average salary rates for men and women are $30,680 and $29,640, 
respectively, the estimated differential is 3.5% of women’s annual salary in this 
similarly  situated employee grouping.13 In most cases, this differential may be 
considered practically significant.
10 This concept is explained in the Appendix.
11 The difference of $312 per year is 0.86% of the women’s average annual salary (0.0086 =   
$312 / $36,400).
12 Whether this estimated differential is in fact practically significant will depend upon its 
interpretation within the organization. Risk tolerances vary by organization, and each 
employer will have its own unique level of acceptable risk, thresholds for practical 
significance, etc.
13 The difference of $1,040 per year is 3.5% of the women’s average annual salary (0.035 = 
$1,040 / $29,640).

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up

Among the five similarly situated employee groupings within the installation 
department, the estimated gender effects range from –$0.10 to –$1.00 per 
hour. The estimated ten-cent-per-hour differential by gender among receiving 
personnel is likely to be practically insignificant. Assuming that the average 
hourly rates of pay for men and women are $11.50 and $11.40, respectively, the 
estimated differential translates into an annual difference of $208; this is less 
than 1% of women’s annual earnings in this similarly situated employee group-
ing.14 In most cases, this differential would not be practically significant.15
The estimated gender differential in hourly rates of pay among forklift opera-
tors is –$1.00. This differential is likely to be practically significant. Assuming 
that the average hourly rates of pay for men and women are $13.85 and 
$12.85, respectively, the estimated differential translates into an annual dif-
ference of $2,080; this is more than 7% of women’s annual earnings in this 
similarly situated employee grouping.16 In most cases, this differential would be 
practically significant. Even though the estimated gender effect is not statisti-
cally significant, its practical significance warrants follow-up.
Directionally Adverse Results
Though it is important to examine the estimated gender effect for each simi-
larly situated employee grouping individually, it is equally important to exam-
ine the estimated effects collectively. A review of Table 7-1 reveals that all of 
the estimated gender effects for the ten similarly situated employee groupings 
are negative, meaning that they are all directionally adverse to women. A 
pattern like this may be indicative of systemic disparate treatment within the 
sales and installation departments.17 Follow-up investigations on these depart-
ments as a whole, and the similarly situated employee groupings contained 
14Assuming that receiving personnel are paid for 2,080 hours per year, we expect a woman 
in this similarly situated employee grouping to earn $23,712 annually ($23,712 = $11.40 
per hour * 2,080 hours per year). We would expect a man in this similarly situated 
employee grouping to earn $23,920 annually ($23,920 = $11.50 per hour * 2,080 hours 
per year). The difference of $208 annually ($208 = $23,920 – $23,712) is 0.88% of the 
woman’s annual salary (0.0088 = $208 / $23,712).
15Whether this estimated differential is in fact practically significant will depend on its 
interpretation within the organization. Risk tolerances vary by organization, and each 
employer will have its own unique level of acceptable risk, thresholds for practical 
significance, and so on.
16Assuming that forklift operators are paid for 2,080 hours a year, we expect a woman in 
this similarly situated employee grouping to earn $28,808 annually ($28,808 = $12.85 
per hour * 2,080 hours per year). We expect a man in this similarly situated employee 
grouping to earn $30,888 annually ($30,888 = $13.85 per hour * 2,080 hours per year). 
The difference of $2,080 annually ($2,080 = $30,888 – $28,808) is 7.2% of the woman’s 
annual salary (0.072 = $2,080 / $28,808).
17Systemic disparate treatment is discussed in Chapter 2.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly

within them, is required. Possible explanations for the universally directionally 
adverse gender effects include discriminatory intent on the part of the deci-
sion maker(s) within these departments, compensation policies and practices 
creating a disparate impact on women, or misspecification of the models for 
these employee groupings. Further investigation is required to determine the 
underlying cause(s) of the estimated gender disparities.
One should not take comfort in an analysis indicating no statistically significant 
disparities in pay by protected group status when the majority of similarly 
situated employee grouping examined has an outcome that is directionally 
adverse to the protected group. Failing to investigate a collection of direction-
ally adverse results can create substantial exposure to a “pattern or practice” 
discrimination claim.
Raw Differentials
As noted in previous chapters, multiple regression analysis is the preferred 
statistical technique for examining questions of internal pay equity. There are 
cases, however, in which multiple regression analysis is inappropriate or impos-
sible.18 In such cases, alternative techniques for the comparisons of pay rates 
are required. Chapter 6 illustrates several of these alternative techniques, such 
as comparison of means or medians, tipping point tests, and threshold tests. 
Generally speaking, these alternative comparisons generate “raw” differentials 
by protected group status, meaning that they focus on two dimensions only: 
compensation and protected group status. These techniques are incapable 
of directly incorporating additional information regarding the determinants 
of compensation. Because of this, the two-dimensional comparison of com-
pensation by protected group status may yield numerous false positive cases 
in which there appears to be a disparity by protected group status but that 
disparity is explained when factors explaining compensation are considered.
All groupings of employees for which these alternative techniques indicate dis-
parities must be investigated. An increase in false positive cases increases the 
volume of follow-up investigations that must be performed. However, it is not 
possible to determine whether the result for a particular group of employees 
can be explained by legitimate nondiscriminatory factors or is unexplained. 
From a risk management perspective, failing to follow up on all disparities 
leaves the organization vulnerable to lawsuits alleging discriminatory differen-
tials in compensation were detected but not remedied. 
18For example, the similarly situated employee grouping may contain too few employees to 
allow for multiple regression analysis.

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up 
186
Systemic versus Individual Follow-Up
Follow-up investigations can be broadly classified into two categories: sys-
temic and individual. The necessity of systemic and/or individual follow-up will 
be determined largely by the analysis results and to a lesser extent by the type 
of analysis performed (e.g., multiple regression, comparison of means, thresh-
old test). Regardless of the type(s) of follow-up performed, the purpose of the 
investigation is to identify explanations for any differences in compensation 
within the similarly situated employee grouping that appear to be attributable 
to protected group status. Ideally, these explanations should relate to factors 
outside of the model.19
Systemic Follow-Up
In some cases, broad patterns will be evident in the analysis results. Table 7-1 
is an example of this; the estimated gender effect is directionally adverse to 
women for all ten similarly situated employee groupings studied. This indi-
cates that a systemic follow-up investigation is warranted.20
To illustrate how a systemic follow-up investigation might proceed, consider 
the following hypothetical example. The investigation begins with a review 
of the organizational structures of the sales and installation departments. 
Figures 7-1A and 7-1B illustrate the organizational structures for these two 
departments.21 
19If a factor is included in the model, it has already been accounted for in the estimation 
process.

scenarios. They are by no means exhaustive and should not be interpreted as such.

As can be seen from Figure 7-1A, Frank Mahoney has supervisory responsi-
bility and decision-making authority over the 312 employees assigned to the 
sales department. Supervisory responsibility within the installation depart-
ment is divided; Karl Schmidt has supervisory responsibility and decision-
making authority over the 125 drivers, installers, and repair personnel. Shawn 
Kendrick has supervisory responsibility and decision-making authority over 
the fifty forklift operators and receiving personnel.

The next stage of the investigation entails conversations with Frank Mahoney, 
Karl Schmidt, and Shawn Kendrick regarding the compensation decisions they 
made for the employees under their supervision. Assume that these conver-
sations reveal the following findings.22
Call Center Agents, Customer Service Representatives, and 
Equipment Sales Representatives
While talking to Frank Mahoney, you learn that the total compensation for 
call center agents, customer service representatives, and equipment sales  
representatives consists of a base salary and incentive compensation. Call 
center agents receive monthly bonus payments for meeting or exceeding 
the processing and completion of a target number of calls. Customer service  
representatives receive quarterly commission payments for product and ser-
vice upsells and add-ons. Equipment sales representatives receive quarterly 
commission payments for meeting or exceeding their sales quotas.
Based on the conversation with Frank, a plausible explanation for the observed 
gender disparity is that the model for this similarly situated employee group-
ing is misspecified.
Among call center agents, customer service representatives, and equipment 
sales representatives, the model structure and the compensation metric are 
mismatched. The model structure, given by Equation 7.1, expresses annual 
salary as a function of seniority, prior relevant experience, and performance. 
However, during the data collection process, total annual compensation, not 
annual salary, was captured. Because these employees receive various forms 
of incentive compensation in addition to their base salary, total annual com-
pensation is likely to exceed annual salary. 
The observed gender disparity is likely attributable to the fact that our com-
pensation metric includes bonus and commission payments, but our model 
structure is based solely on annual salary. This mismatch between the com-
pensation metric and the model is a plausible explanation for the observed 
gender disparity if there are legitimate differences in earned incentive com-
pensation by gender.
There are two approaches to resolving this mismatch. The first is to collect 
salary data and reestimate the models using annual salary, rather than total 
annual compensation. Alternatively, data regarding the factors determining 
incentive compensation could be collected, the models could be respecified to 
22These scenarios are only a handful of an innumerable set of possible scenarios and 
should not be interpreted as an exhaustive listing of all possible outcomes. They are 
presented for illustrative purposes only.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
189
incorporate these additional factors, and the respecified model could be rees-
timated using total annual compensation as the compensation metric under 
investigation.
The choice of approach will be determined by the question the analysis is 
intended to address. If one is interested in examining whether annual salaries 
are set equitably according to the relevant compensation policies and prac-
tices, then reestimation of the model using annual salary, rather than total 
annual compensation, is the preferred approach. Assuming that an analysis 
of annual salary does not indicate pay disparities by gender, then the gender 
disparities initially observed can be explained by the mismatch between the 
compensation metric and model misspecification. However, if gender dispari-
ties persist, then follow-up investigations are warranted.
On the other hand, if one is interested in examining whether differences in 
total compensation by gender exist, then respecification and reestimation is 
the preferred approach. The model structures for call center agents, cus-
tomer service representatives, and equipment sales representatives could be 
respecified to account for incentive compensation as given in Equations 7.4, 
7.5, and 7.6, respectively:

Assuming that the estimation of these respecified models do not indicate 
pay disparities by gender, then the gender disparities initially observed can be 
explained by model misspecification. If gender disparities persist, then follow-
up investigations are warranted.
It should be noted that even if the reestimation of the respecified models 
reveals no differences in total compensation by gender, it does not automat-
ically follow that the employer is invulnerable to claims of discrimination. 
Although the analysis results do not support a claim of disparate treatment, 
there may be vulnerability to a claim of disparate impact. 
The incentive compensation (i.e., bonuses and commissions) received by these 
employees is formula-based. As noted in Chapter 2, formula-based compensa-
tion systems are typically protected under Section 703(h) of Title VII. If a plain-
tiff were to make a claim and prove that the incentive compensation structure 

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up 
190
was adopted with actual discriminatory purpose, the employer could be found 
liable for discrimination. The recommended course of action, therefore, is to 
examine the formula-based elements of compensation for disparate impact to 
assess vulnerability to disparate impact claims.
Purchasing Agents
During the conversation with Frank, you learn that several of the purchasing 
agents were red circled following reassignment from more senior positions. 
Based on this, red circling of some employees may explain the observed gen-
der disparity in compensation. The red-circled people should be identified, and 
the model should be respecified to incorporate a red circle dummy variable:

(7.7)
Assuming that the estimation of this respecified model does not indicate 
pay disparities by gender, then the gender disparity initially observed can be 
explained by red circling. If gender disparities persist, then an individual follow-
up investigation is warranted.
Pricing Specialists
Your conversation with Frank reveals that he cannot think of a plausible  
explanation for the observed gender disparity in salary among pricing specialists.  
Therefore, individual follow-up investigation is required for this similarly situ-
ated employee grouping.
Drivers, Installers, and Repair Personnel
While talking to Karl Schmidt, you learn that the manner in which hourly pay 
rates are determined for new hires was changed three years ago. Previously, 
the initial rate of pay for a newly hired driver, installer, or repair person was 
based on the individual’s prior relevant experience. Currently, the initial pay 
rate is fixed for new hires and no consideration is given to prior relevant 
experience.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
191
A review of the driver, installer, and repair personnel indicates that all were hired 
three or more years ago. Hence, the model originally estimated is inconsistent 
with how the compensation of these individuals was determined. The model 
needs to be respecified to incorporate prior relevant experience as follows:

Assuming that the estimation of this respecified equation does not indicate

explained by failing to incorporate prior relevant experience in the model. If gen-
der disparities persist, then individual follow-up investigations are warranted.
Forklift Operators
During your conversation with Shawn Kendrick, the following exchange occurs:
You: I’ve been looking at the pay rates for your direct 
reports. The compensation policy indicates that pay 
rates are determined by seniority, employee perfor-
mance, and whether the individual has a forklift certifi-
cation. After accounting for these factors, Janette—the 
only female forklift operator—earns $1.00 an hour less 
than her male counterparts. Can you think of anything 
that would explain that difference?
Shawn: She’s a poor performer.
You: The $1.00 an hour difference accounts for per-
formance, so that can’t be the explanation.
Shawn: She’s not a good fit. Nobody wants her out 
here on the docks.
You: Would you elaborate on that, please?
Shawn: Look, there’s a reason that she’s the only girl 
working as a forklift operator. Everyone knows it’s a 
man’s job, and girls just shouldn’t be running heavy 
equipment. It’s bad enough I’m stuck with the girls in 
receiving. They don’t belong in the warehouse, and 
they damn sure shouldn’t be running forklifts and wor-
king the docks!

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up 
192
Based on the comments made during the conversation with Shawn, a possible 
explanation for the observed gender disparity among forklift operators is 
discrimination. A closer review of this similarly situated employee grouping at 
the individual level is required.
Receiving Personnel
Shawn’s comments indicate that discrimination is also a possible explana-
tion for the observed gender disparity among receiving personnel. A closer 
review of this similarly situated employee grouping at the individual level is 
also required.
Individual Follow-Up
If no broad patterns are evident in the analysis results, or if systemic follow-
up investigations reveal a more detailed examination of the similarly situated 
employee grouping is warranted, individual follow-up investigations should be 
undertaken.
Following along with the hypothetical example from before, individual follow-
up investigations are warranted for pricing specialists, forklift operators, and 
receiving personnel.
Pricing Specialists
As previously noted, the annual salaries of pricing specialists are determined 
by total company seniority, relevant prior experience, and performance. To 
identify the source of the observed gender disparity within this similarly situ-
ated employee grouping, personnel data on each of the pricing specialists 
should be collected. Assume that Table 7-2 presents a portion of this person-
nel data for four pricing specialists: two male and two female.23
23Personnel data should be collected on all individuals employed in this job title. For 
illustrative purposes, this example limits the data presented to only four employees.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
193
A review of each employee’s data leads to an interesting observation. In all 
four cases, the employee’s prior relevant experience is equal to his or her total
prior experience, which is incorrect. The effect of this on the analysis results 
is perhaps best illustrated through a comparison of Employees 1835 (Daniel 
Hill) and 1960 (Jennifer Davis).
Jennifer Davis and Daniel Hill appear to be identical on all characteristics 
reported in Table 7-2. They were hired on the same date, hold the same 
job title, and report to the same supervisor. Both have 3.5 years of total 
prior experience and 3.5 years of relevant prior experience. Based on this, 
we would expect their annual salaries to be identical. In reality, they are not; 
Daniel earns $500 a year more than Jennifer does.
A detailed review of each employee’s prior experience information reveals 
the underlying cause of this difference. At the time he was hired, Daniel had 
3.5 years of experience as a pricing specialist with Omega Electrical Supply. 
At the time she was hired, Jennifer had only six months of experience as a 
pricing specialist with ABC Manufacturing. The remainder of her experience 
was as a retail sales clerk and a customer service representative. 
Given that Daniel has three more years of experience as a pricing special-
ist than Jennifer has, it is not surprising that his annual salary is greater than 
hers. It appears as though there is a disparity by gender, but this disparity 
is attributable to incorrect measurement of relevant prior experience. The 
model that was estimated for pricing specialists used as an input the relevant 
Table 7-2. Sampling of Hypothetical Personnel Data for Pricing Specialists

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up 
194
prior experience given in the data set. That information is incorrect in that it 
reflects total prior experience, not relevant prior experience. Assuming that 
the annual salaries for Jennifer and Daniel were determined based on a review 
of their employment histories—and therefore an accurate assessment of rel-
evant prior experience—there is no disparity. The disparity indicated by the 
analysis results is simply an artifact of incorrect data measurement.
Forklift Operators
The similarly situated employee grouping containing forklift operators pres-
ents a unique challenge in that there is only one woman within the grouping. 
The ideal manner of follow-up is to identify male employees who have identi-
cal characteristics to the woman in the grouping and examine their character-
istics vis-à-vis her characteristics.
A review of the forklift operators roster reveals that there are two male 
employees—Brian Mitchell and José Rodriguez—who have characteristics 
nearly identical to those of the lone woman, Janette Baker. Table 7-3 presents 
a portion of the personnel data for the three forklift operators.
Table 7-3.  Sampling of Hypothetical Personnel Data for Forklift Operators

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
195
As can be seen, all three employees were hired on July 1, 2007. All three are 
certified to operate a forklift, and their certifications expire on the same date. 
All three received performance ratings of 4.0 for the evaluation periods ending 
on July 1, 2011, and July 1, 2012; Rodriguez had a slightly lower performance 
rating than Mitchell or Baker for the evaluation period ending July 1, 2010.24
Based on these characteristics, there appears to be no discernible differences 
between the employees. However, an examination of the performance evalu-
ation comments reveals a difference. For the last three evaluation periods, 
Shawn Kendrick has commented that Janette was “not a good fit for the ware-
house,” “disruptive to the working environment,” and may be better suited 
for an inside sales position. Neither of her two comparators received such 
comments.25
This finding, coupled with the views expressed by Shawn during the discus-
sion (“everyone knows that it’s a man’s job, women don’t belong in the ware-
house,” etc.), indicates that the likely cause of the observed disparity in hourly 
pay rates by gender is discriminatory pay-setting practices on the part of 
Shawn Kendrick.26
Receiving Personnel
Within the similarly situated employee grouping of twenty-one male and nine 
female receiving personnel, a ten-cents-per-hour difference by gender was 
observed. This difference cannot be attributed to seniority, performance, or 
possession of a forklift certification, because the model already accounts for 
these factors. A deeper investigation of the differential is required.
Table 7-4 presents a portion of personnel data for two men and two women 
from this similarly situated employee grouping (Ken Gonzales, Carol Harris, 
Joe Taylor, and Nancy Smith). As can be seen, all four employees were hired 
on August 16, 2010. Among them, all but Ken are certified to operate a fork-
lift; the certifications for Carol, Joe, and Nancy expire on the same date. All 
four received performance ratings of 4.0 for the evaluation periods ending on  
July 1, 2012. 
24Shawn Kendrick’s comment that Janette Baker was a “poor performer” is in contradiction 
to her performance evaluation scores.
25In fact, a review of the performance evaluations for all of the forklift operators reveals 
that Janette was the only employee who received such comments on her performance 
evaluation.
26The appropriate way in which to deal with Shawn’s comments regarding the role of 
women in warehouse positions and his potential gender discrimination in pay rates 
against women is beyond the scope of this discussion. Legal counsel should be consulted 
and should be involved in any disciplinary actions or other consequences imposed.

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up 
196
Based on these characteristics, there appears to be no discernible difference 
between Carol, Joe, and Nancy. We would expect their hourly pay rates to be 
the same. A review of their hourly pay rates indicates that Joe is paid $0.10 an 
hour more than his female counterparts. Additionally, we would expect Ken’s 
hourly pay rate to be lower than the other three, because he does not possess 
a forklift certification. However, he is earning the same hourly rate as Carol 
and Nancy, both of whom possess a forklift certification.
An examination of the performance evaluation comments reveals a difference 
by gender. Even though all four employees received a score of 4.0, the tone of 
Kendrick’s evaluation comments differ by gender. He noted that both Ken and 
Joe are “big assets to the warehouse environment,” whereas Carol “uses too 
much of her paid time off,” and Nancy “won’t work overtime because of her 
kids.” A review of the performance evaluation comments for the remaining 
nineteen men and seven women in this similarly situated employee grouping 
reveals a similar pattern.
Additionally, the pay increases granted to these four employees differ by gen-
der. Even though all four are identical in terms of seniority and performance, 
the men received a $0.25 per hour increase on July 1, 2012, whereas the 
female employees received only a $0.15 an hour increase. There appears to 
be no justification for this $0.10 an hour difference by gender. A review of 
the pay increases granted to the remaining people in this similarly situated 
employee grouping reveals a similar pattern.
Table 7-4.  Sampling of Hypothetical Personnel Data for Receiving Personnel

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
197
This, coupled with the views he expressed regarding women in the ware-
house, indicates that the likely cause of the observed disparity in hourly pay 
rates by gender is discriminatory pay setting practices on the part of Shawn 
Kendrick.27 
The Compensation Adjustment Process
Commonly, statistically significant disparities with no obvious explanation (or 
in cases where discriminatory pay setting practices are suspected or evident) 
are remediated via compensation adjustments. Regardless of how the employer 
chooses to investigate and remediate the statistically significant disparities, it 
is imperative that an investigation precedes remediation. As illustrated in the 
previous hypothetical example, follow-up investigation may reveal legitimate 
nondiscriminatory factors that were not considered in the statistical model 
but nonetheless explain variation in compensation. These factors, if they exist, 
should be identified and considered prior to contemplating or instituting any 
changes in compensation.
Though it is generally considered a best practice to involve legal counsel in any 
reviews of compensation for internal pay equity, any remediation to potential 
problem areas discovered during the review should only be done under the 
auspices of legal counsel. The implications of making remedies to compensa-
tion are significant, and legal counsel is best positioned to understand these 
implications and advise the organization on appropriate remedies.
The discussion of adjusting compensation to achieve internal pay equity in 
the following subsections is intentionally presented in general terms using 
overly simplistic examples. Each situation encountered in real life is unique 
and requires careful consideration. As such, it is simply not possible to pres-
ent all variants of every scenario one may encounter. Similarly, it is not fea-
sible to present every possible adjustment scenario. There are no definitive 
rules for adjusting compensation to achieve internal pay equity. No checklists 
or flowcharts exist; it is both science and art. The following discussion is 
intended only to provide a cursory introduction to the compensation adjust-
ment process.
27As previously noted, the appropriate course of action for dealing with Mr. Kendrick’s 
comments regarding the role of women in warehouse positions and his potential gender 
discrimination in pay rates against women is beyond the scope of this discussion. Legal 
counsel should be consulted and should be involved in any disciplinary actions or other 
consequences imposed on Mr. Kendrick.

Identifying Employees Requiring Adjustment
In some situations, the identification of employees whose compensation rates 
are out of line with their counterparts is very straightforward. In the case of the 
forklift operators in the previous example, it is obvious that the sole woman, 
Janette Baker, is paid $1.00 per hour less than her male counterparts, Brian 
Mitchell and José Rodriguez, who have identical characteristics to Janette.
Similarly, as can be seen from Table 7-4, the female receiving personnel are 
paid less than their male counterparts. Additionally, the annual increases in 
hourly pay rates received by these women are less than that of their male 
counterparts.28 As previously discussed, the likely explanation for this dispar-
ity is discriminatory pay setting practices by the supervisor, Shawn Kendrick. 
In this case, all women within this similarly situated employee grouping should 
receive a pay adjustment to bring their hourly pay rates in line with those of 
their male counterparts. 
In other situations, however, the identification of employees whose compensa-
tion rates are out of line with their counterparts is more challenging. Assume, 
for example, that we are interested in examining the annual salary amounts 
for a similarly situated employee grouping consisting of cost estimators. The 
factors determining the annual salary of a cost estimator are time in job (mea-
sured in whole years) and whether the individual holds a certification from the 
American Society of Professional Estimators. Among the incumbent cost esti-
mators, time in job ranges from three to ten years. Table 7-5 shows that annual 
salaries for the incumbent cost estimators ranges from $53,000 to $62,225.

The results of this multiple regression analysis are given in Figure 7-2. As you 
can see, there is a statistically significant gender effect of –$703 per year.
Figure 7-2.  Regression output for cost estimators
Assume that follow-up investigations reveal no obvious explanation for the 
gender differential (i.e., there are no mismatches between the compensation 
metric and the explanatory variables, the model is properly specified, and so on).
Because there are no obvious causes of the gender disparity, compensation 
adjustments are warranted in this case. However, not all women in this simi-
larly situated employee grouping should receive adjustments. Table 7-5 shows 
that all cost estimators with three years of time in job are earning $53,000, 
irrespective of gender. Therefore, increasing the salary amounts for the two 
female cost estimators with three years of time in job is neither appropriate 
nor warranted. In fact, if this adjustment was made, it would create a situation 
in which the male cost estimators were paid less than their female counter-
parts. Making this adjustment would not only fail to resolve the internal equity 
issue among cost estimators, it would also actually exacerbate the inequities 
among these four employees.
Among cost estimators with four years of time in job, however, the annual 
salaries range from $54,275 to $55,500; the average annual salary, as shown in 
Table 7-5, is $54,758. Employee-level detail for cost estimators with four years 
of time in job is given in Table 7-6.

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up 
200
A detailed review of the six cost estimators with four years of time in job indi-
cates that all of the women receive a lower annual salary than their male coun-
terparts. In fact, all four women—who possess certification from the American 
Society of Professional Estimators—receive a lower annual salary than the 
man in the employee grouping who does not possess this certification.
Aside from the gender disparity, there is an overall equity issue within this 
similarly situated employee grouping. The two male cost estimators both 
receive an annual salary of $55,000. Though both males have four years of 
time in job, only one is certified. Because certification factors in to the deter-
mination of annual salary, we would expect the man who is certified to have 
a greater annual salary than the man who is not. In actuality, their salaries are 
the same.
From a gender equity perspective, the four women in this similarly situated 
employee grouping require an upward adjustment of annual salary. Also, the 
four women and the one certified man require an upward adjustment of 
annual salary.29
To identify all individuals within this similarly situated employee grouping 
requiring an adjustment of annual salary, the above-described comparisons 
would be repeated for each of the subgroups defined by time in job. 
29This, of course, assumes that all cost estimators with four years of time in job are identical 
in all other respects.

Determining the Magnitude of Adjustment
After identifying which employees require a compensation adjustment, the 
magnitude of the adjustment must be determined. In some situations the size 
of the required adjustment is self-evident. In the case of the forklift operators, 
the gender disparity can be rectified by increasing Janette Baker’s hourly rate 
by $1.00. This adjustment would bring her hourly rate in line with the hourly 
rates of her male counterparts.
In other situations, the magnitude of the adjustment(s) will not immediately 
be self-evident. In many cases, different people within the similarly situated 
employee grouping will require different adjustment amounts. This is the case 
for the similarly situated employee grouping of cost estimators.
One obvious approach to eliminating the estimated –$703.27 gender effect 
on annual salary shown in Figure 7-2 would be to increase the annual salary 
of all female employees across the board by $703.27. If this adjustment were 
made, the gender disparity would be eliminated in the aggregate, as shown in 
Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-3.  Regression output for cost estimators using adjusted salary amounts
Though there would be no evidence of a statistically significant gender dispar-
ity in annual salary among the similarly situated employee grouping of sixty-six 
cost estimators, this blanket adjustment to female salaries may create inequi-
ties within subgroups of the similarly situated employee grouping. For exam-
ple, all cost estimators with three years of time in job are currently earning 
$53,000, as previously noted. If the salaries of the two women were increased 
by $703.27, they would be earning more than their two comparators. On the 
other hand, an increase of $703.27 would not remedy the gender disparities 
between cost estimators with six years of time in job, as shown in Table 7-7. 

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up 
202
Even after the adjustment, the female salaries are still below those of their 
male counterparts. The gender disparity is smaller, but internal equity has not 
been achieved. To do so, a more tailored approach is required, focusing on 
adjustments at the individual employee level.
Following this tailored approach, in the case of cost estimators with four years 
of time in job, one might be tempted to reset the annual salaries of all six 
employees to $54,500, the maximum of the female salary. As shown in Table 7-8, 
this adjustment process would involve a $225 increase in salary for Employees 
1496 and 1502, and a $1,000 reduction in salary for Employees 1523 and 1527.

Although it may eliminate the gender disparity within this subgroup, this 
adjustment violates the Equal Pay Act. As stated in Section 206 of the Equal 
Pay Act of 1963, reductions in compensation to achieve internal pay equity 
are prohibited:
An employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this 
subsection shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of this 
subsection, reduce the wage rate of any employee.
A disparity in compensation by protected group status cannot be remedied 
by decreasing the compensation of the majority group. Therefore, this adjust-
ment is not legally permissible.
The alternative is to leave the male salary at $55,500 and adjust the women’s 
salaries upward. Table 7-9 illustrates the increase in annual salary for each 
female employee necessary to achieve gender pay equity.
30 In order to maintain consistency in compensation within the entire similarly situated 
employee grouping, the “dollar value” of certification will – in most cases – take on a 
constant value irrespective of time in job.
This adjustment will eliminate the gender disparity; all cost estimators with 
four years of time in job will earn $55,500. 
From an overall equity perspective, however, one issue remains. The one 
employee (ID 1527) who is not certified is earning the same annual salary as 
the other five employees who are certified. If certification carries a premium, 
then to achieve overall equity, the salaries of the certified employees must 
be greater than that of the one individual who is not certified. One possible 
adjustment scenario that would achieve overall equity is given in Table 7-10.30

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up 
204
As evidenced by the preceding discussion, correcting a pay differential for a 
given protected group is, in most cases, more involved than simply increasing 
the compensation rate for members of the protected group by the magni-
tude of the estimated protected effect. Such blanket increases may yield a 
statistically insignificant estimated protected effect but can create situations 
of inequity among subgroups within the similarly situated employee grouping. 
Utmost care should be taken in determining the magnitude(s) of the compen-
sation adjustments.
Equity versus Statistical Insignificance
Remediating situations of internal pay inequity can be a costly process, in 
terms of the resources spent on detection, investigation, and identification 
of appropriate corrections as well as payroll dollars. Making appropriate 
adjustments (which are typically upward adjustments) can lead to substantial 
increases in labor costs. Because of this, some employers are lured by the 
prospect of instituting only enough adjustment to generate statistically insig-
nificant results. This may save some money in the short run, but in the long 
run it can lead to greater expenditures in the form of legal fees, damages, and 
fines and penalties.
For example, consider the case of the similarly situated employee grouping 
consisting of cost estimators. The estimated gender effect of –$703.27 is 
statistically significant, as shown in Figure 7-2. Providing a salary increase of 
0.95% to every woman in this employee grouping would reduce the estimated 
gender effect to –$161.33; this effect is statistically insignificant (t = 1.81, p = 
0.075), as shown in Figure 7-4. Because this result is statistically insignificant, it 
is not statistically different from zero, and no adverse inference can or should 
be drawn. Even though the estimated gender effect is directionally adverse to 
women, we cannot attribute this to anything other than chance. Therefore, 
this outcome is consistent with the hypothesis that the manner in which sala-
ries of cost estimators are determined is neutral with respect to gender.

We carry these adjustments through for all of the cost estimators in the similarly 
situated employee grouping and note there is a substantial difference in payroll 
costs associated with the two remedial approaches. As shown in Table 7-12, 
the statistical significance of the estimated gender effect—but not the gender 
effect itself—can be eliminated by increasing the salary of every woman in 
the similarly situated employee grouping by 0.95% for a modest increase of 
$15,672 in payroll costs. Achieving true pay equity within this similarly situated 
employee grouping would increase payroll costs by nearly $95,000.

Aside from eliminating the statistical significance of the estimated gender

with eliminating the differential, as shown in Table 7-11.

Chapter 7 | Analysis Follow-Up 
206
In some cases, achieving statistical insignificance of protected group effects is 
cheaper, in terms of payroll dollars, than achieving internal pay equity. However, 
statistical insignificance does not provide the competitive advantages and ben-
efits of attraction and retention of top talent, increased employee engage-
ment, and increased productivity that internal pay equity provides. As noted 
in Chapter 1, to fully leverage the competitive advantages provided, organiza-
tions must ensure that all employees are paid fairly.
Furthermore, achieving statistical insignificance of protected group effects 
may not successfully manage the risk of compensation discrimination litiga-
tion or regulatory investigation. If disparities exist, statistically significant or 
otherwise, employers can still face costly litigation and/or audits by regulatory 
agencies. In fact, pursing a course of eliminating statistical significance but not 
pay differentials can place an employer in a much worse position in litigation 
or regulatory investigation than failing to identify pay differentials in the first 
place. The Wal-Mart case discussed at the beginning of this chapter hints at 
the consequences of such a course of action; more detailed examples are 
provided in Chapter 10.
Making and Communicating Adjustments
Follow-up investigations culminate in making and communicating adjustments 
in compensation, where appropriate. The exact manner in which the adjust-
ments are made will differ depending on the particular circumstances, but 
generally speaking, there are two approaches to making adjustments: immedi-
ate and extended.
Immediate adjustments proceed exactly as their name implies—the adjust-
ments are made by making a one-time change in compensation. For example, 
granting one-time equity increases ranging from $500 to $1,725 among cost 
estimators with four years of time in job would be classified as an immediate 
adjustment. Typically, immediate adjustments are made in cases where the 
magnitude of the necessary adjustment is relatively small or the number of 
employees requiring adjustment is relatively small.

207
Extended adjustments occur over a period of time. Rather than granting a one-
time equity adjustment, compensation is increased to the target level over 
the span of several evaluation periods. For example, employees warranting 
equity adjustments may be given larger annual increases than they would have 
otherwise received to bring compensation in line with other similarly situ-
ated employees. Typically, extended adjustments are made in cases where the 
magnitude of the necessary adjustment is relatively large or the number of 
employees requiring adjustment is relatively large.
It is not uncommon for employers to use a blended approach; one-time equity 
adjustments may be given to partially eliminate the pay differential between 
an employee and similarly situated counterparts, with the remainder of the 
differential eliminated over time via larger-than-typical annual increases.
Because pay equity adjustments have legal ramifications, the manner in which 
adjustments are made should be discussed with legal counsel. Legal counsel is 
best positioned to provide guidance on how to make the necessary compen-
sation adjustments while minimizing any legal complications that may arise. 
This is particularly important if the employer is already involved in compensa-
tion-related litigation or regulatory investigation.
Legal counsel should also be involved in planning how the compensation 
adjustments will be communicated to employees. The preferred communi-
cation approach will vary depending on the number of employees receiving 
adjustments, the magnitude of the necessary adjustments, and whether the 
employer has been or is currently involved in compensation-related litigation 
or regulatory investigation, among other factors.
Generally speaking, communication with employees about pay equity adjust-
ments should emphasize that the organization is committed to a fair and non-
discriminatory workplace. In an effort to provide a fair workplace, a review 
of compensation practices was performed, and that review uncovered poten-
tial inequities. The adjustments are being made to address those potential 
problem areas and to ensure that everyone—irrespective of protected group 
status—is paid fairly and equitably.31
31As previously mentioned, the involvement of legal counsel in planning these communi­
cations is essential. Counsel should review and sign off on any verbal or written 
communication to employees regarding compensation adjustments.

The Changing 
Landscape 
of Pay Equity 
Enforcement
Since the late 2000s and early 2010s, there have been major changes in the 
legal and regulatory environment regarding compensation discrimination, and 
there are even more on the horizon. These changes encompass both individual 
claims and claims of systemic compensation discrimination.
Three of the most important changes affect the very nature of a compen-
sation discrimination claim, the compensation information collected by the 
government, and the way employers are permitted to compensate their 
employees. These changes are the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the formation 
of the National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force, and the introduction of the 
Paycheck Fairness Act.

Chapter 8 | The Changing Landscape of Pay Equity Enforcement
210
The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
Signed in to law on January 29, 2009, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act amends 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It states that the 180-day statute of limitations for 
filing an equal pay claim resets with the issuance of each new discriminatory 
paycheck.1 
Under this new law, an employee can potentially file a lawsuit for discrimina-
tory pay decisions every time that decision is applied. This includes each time 
wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, even if that decision occurred 
twenty or thirty years ago.
Compensation Decision Documentation
The reset provision of the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act presents a unique chal-
lenge to employers: without documentation, it is difficult to remember how 
pay increases were determined five or ten years ago. It is nearly impossible 
to remember how those decisions were made twenty or thirty years ago. 
Memories fade as time passes, and the people who made those compensation 
decisions are less and less likely to still be employed by an organization.
From a practical standpoint, each pay decision should be carefully documented, 
and that documentation should be retained. In addition to pay stubs, records 
of hours worked, and other records relating to the payment of wages, it is 
critical that compensation decision documentation is created and retained.
When you, as an employer, decide your employees’ wages, salaries, pay 
increases . . . how do you arrive at a specific figure? I’m talking about 
performance reviews—what metrics were used—signed copies of the 
completed review, signed copies of the criteria at the start of the review 
period. Often companies will conduct or purchase industry statistics to 
ensure that they’re paying people in the expected range for their industry. 
Employers are not “dart-boarding” compensation decisions. Record where 
these figures are coming from.2
Specifically, compensation decision documentation should address the following 
kinds of questions.
How were the compensation decisions made? What ­factors 
• 
were considered?
1The genesis of the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 is discussed in Chapter 1.

How did the organization arrive at the specific compen-
• 
sation figures for employees?
What metrics and criteria were used to evaluate employ-
• 
ees’ performance?
Were the performance metrics and criteria validated?
• 
What compensation surveys or industry statistics were 
• 
used to determine compensation amounts?
If a specific employee’s compensation was affected by 
• 
special circumstances (e.g., red circling), what were the 
details of those circumstances?
It is important to create this compensation decision documentation con-
temporaneously, at the time they are made, while surveys, industry statis-
tics, evaluations, and so on are easily accessible. Creating documentation for 
compensation decisions that occurred in the past is time-consuming and 
resource-intensive. The most effective way of creating compensation decision 
documentation is to do so on an ongoing basis. 
This documentation should be not only created, but also retained. In the event 
that compensation decisions need to be re-created or justified at a future 
point in time, typically as a result of litigation or regulatory investigation, hav-
ing access to appropriate documentation from the time these decisions were 
made will facilitate this process.
A common issue that arises with respect to compensation decision documen-
tation relates to how long this documentation should be retained. The reten-
tion period of some types of compensation documentation is governed by law, 
but decision documentation typically falls outside of the scope of retention 
statues.3 Thus, the retention period for compensation decision documentation 
is a matter of judgment.
The surefire method to eliminate concern about retention is to retain every-
thing indefinitely. However, this is a very impractical solution. The appropri-
ate retention period depends on, among other things, the type of document 
retention system in use by the organization. Paper-based retention systems 
can quickly become unwieldy and ineffective, and retaining information for 
extended periods of time can become cost-prohibitive. Retaining documenta-
tion in electronic form is an efficient and cost-effective alternative and in most 
cases allows more information to be retained at a lower cost with lower 
storage requirements.
3For example, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor have laws governing 
what types of compensation documentation and employee information must be retained and 
for how long. Some employment laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, also have these 
requirements. A detailed discussion of these retention periods is given in Chapter 10.

Chapter 8 | The Changing Landscape of Pay Equity Enforcement

Note
■
■
  Ask yourself the following question before destroying any compensation decision 
document: Without this document, what compensation decision(s) will go unsupported if we are 
involved in a lawsuit or regulatory investigation?
There is no universally correct answer to the question of document retention 
period. Each employer should arrive at a unique solution to document retention 
through a cost-benefit analysis.
“Other Practice” Language
As important as document retention is, it is not the only facet of the Ledbetter 
Fair Pay Act that poses potential difficulty for employers. The act states that 
the statute of limitations resets with each new “application of a discriminatory 
compensation decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits 
or other compensation is paid.” The potential difficulty lies in two words: other 
practice.
Despite the fact that the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act has been in effect since 2009, 
the meaning of “other practices” remains unclear. In their article “The Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009: A Preliminary Report,” Joanna Grossman 
and Deborah Brake state that “the plain meaning of the Act suggests that 
it encompasses employment practices that cause an employee to receive 
lower compensation than she should have received but for the discriminatory 
practice.”4 
From this perspective, an other practice could be any seemingly legitimate, 
nondiscriminatory factor that has an effect on compensation, such as pay 
grade, department, location, or shift.
For example, assume that employees in Pay Grade 9 are paid between $40,000 
and $45,000 annually, and employees in Pay Grade 10 earn between $50,000 
and $55,000 annually. A statistical analysis of employee compensation reveals 
no evidence of discrimination with respect to gender or race in either of the 
pay grades.
Even though compensation decisions within each pay grade are made equita-
bly, an employee could make the claim that she should be in Pay Grade 10 but 
was assigned to Pay Grade 9 because of discrimination. In this case, the pay 
decision at issue is not that within the pay grade but the assignment to pay 
grade itself. Assignment to pay grade becomes the “other practice” under the 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.

Other practice claims are a relatively new area, and it is not yet clear what 
kinds of claims will be made. It is also not yet clear how successful these 
claims will be when tried in a court of law. Although it may be difficult to 
prove, it is relatively easy for an employee to claim that she was assigned to 
the wrong pay grade, department, and so on, because of discrimination. Even 
if the claim is unfounded, employers will still need to launch a defense, which 
can be expensive and time-consuming.
From a risk management perspective, this means that compensation decisions 
cannot be examined in isolation. All of these other practices are in play and need 
to be considered and incorporated into studies of compensation equity.

  Any kind of personnel decision—anywhere in the organization—likely will have a 
compensation component. In light of the other practice element of the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, 
employers should take a big-picture perspective when analyzing compensation for internal equity.
It is critical that employers take a big-picture perspective and consider all of these 
potential other factors when examining compensation for internal equity. 
The National Equal Pay Enforcement  
Task Force
In his 2010 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama stated, “We’re 
going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws—so that women get 
equal pay for an equal day’s work.”5 As a result of this renewed commitment 
to equal pay, the National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force was created.6 
The interagency task force consists of members from four different agencies: 
the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), the Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
A number of laws exist to address equal pay; the task force, however, has iden-
tified five persistent challenges to the enforcement of these equal pay laws.7

Enforcement Task Force. In recent months, however, the group has referred to itself as the 
Equal Pay Task Force. See, for example, “Equal Pay Task Force Accomplishments,” White House,

1.
Three federal agencies have responsibilities for enforc-
ing laws prohibiting pay discrimination, but they do not 
consistently coordinate those responsibilities.
2.
Employees and employers are insufficiently educated 
in their rights and obligations with respect to wage 
discrimination.
3.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has 
identified an eleven-cent wage gap between the 
average salaries of men and women in the federal 
workforce.
4.
The government’s ability to understand the full scope 
of the wage gap and identify and combat wage dis-
crimination can be improved by access to more data 
than are currently available.
5.
Existing laws do not always provide federal officials 
with adequate tools to fight wage discrimination.
Since its formation, the task force has made a variety of recommendations 
regarding interagency cooperation, education and outreach, and understand-
ing the full scope of the wage gap. The majority of these recommendations 
have resulted in proposed legislation and changes in the regulatory environ-
ment, all of which have implications for employers. The task force has also 
taken a strong position regarding the tools necessary for combating wage 
discrimination and the insufficiency of existing tools. As such, it is supporting 
a variety of proposed regulations and legislation, such as the Office of Federal 
Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) proposed compensation data 
collection tool and the Paycheck Fairness Act.
Interagency Cooperation
Interagency cooperation in enforcement of equal pay laws is a priority on the 
task force agenda, and member agencies are taking steps to streamline the 
sharing of information and coordinate enforcement efforts. In its Action Plan, 
the task force made the following recommendation: 
The EEOC, DOJ, and DOL will establish a standing working group to 
coordinate interagency enforcement of wage discrimination laws and 
to help implement Task Force recommendations. The agencies will focus 
on improving coordination and communication among the agencies, 
coordinating investigations and litigation, identifying areas in which they 
can issue joint guidance to employers and employees, and conducting 

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
215
joint training as appropriate. The agencies will confer with one another 
to promote consistency in policy and litigation positions, including 
opportunities to file amicus briefs.8
As a result of this recommendation, cooperation and coordination between 
enforcement agencies has significantly increased, agreements between agen-
cies have been created, and preexisting agreements have been reinvigorated.
EEOC–OFCCP Memorandum of Understanding
The EEOC and OFCCP have issued a Memorandum of Understanding that 
outlines a strategy to promote greater efficiency and coordination and to 
eliminate conflict and duplication of effort.
The terms of the memorandum indicate that procedures for notification and 
consultation during compliance activities will be established, and joint enforce-
ment initiatives will be developed. The EEOC and OFCCP have agreed to 
establish compliance coordination committees to increase efficiency, minimize 
duplication of efforts, and ensure coordination of enforcement activities.
In addition, the memorandum provides OFCCP with the ability to act as an 
agent of the EEOC for purposes of accepting and investigating charges of 
discrimination, as well as providing for data sharing and referring individual 
charges of discrimination from OFCCP to the EEOC. 
Specifically, the EEOC and OFCCP will share any information regarding the 
employment policies and/or practices of employers holding government con-
tracts or subcontracts that will support the enforcement mandates of each 
agency and/or their joint enforcement efforts. This information includes (but 
is not limited to) affirmative action programs, annual employment reports, 
complaints, charges, investigative files, and compliance evaluation reports.
OFCCP–DOJ Cooperation
The DOJ and OFCCP are also working to improve coordination and coopera-
tion in the enforcement of Executive Order 11246.9 Specifically, these agencies 
are working collaboratively to improve enforcement efforts and develop crite-
ria to determine when interagency referrals and/or enforcement partnerships 
8Ibid.
9Executive Order 11246 was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on September 24, 1965. It 
established requirements for nondiscriminatory practices in hiring and in employment for 
federal contractors and subcontractors. Specifically, the order prohibits federal contractors 
and subcontractors from discriminating in employment decisions on the basis of race, color, 
religion, sex, or national origin. It also requires contractors and subcontractors to “take 
affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated 
during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin.”

Chapter 8 | The Changing Landscape of Pay Equity Enforcement
216
are appropriate in cases involving compensation discrimination. On the recom-
mendation of OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu, the DOJ is authorized to initiate 
independent investigations and sue contractors it believes are in violation of 
the executive order. The DOL and the DOJ are evaluating whether this authority 
can be applied to improve enforcement efforts. 
DOJ–EEOC Pilot Project
Since early 2010, DOJ attorneys have been working closely with EEOC dis-
trict offices in Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco through 
a pilot project aimed at improved coordination in investigating discrimination 
charges against state and local public employees. Other EEOC district offices 
(Denver, New York, Indianapolis, and Washington, D.C.) have been informally 
involved in pilot project investigations. According to the task force report on 
its accomplishments, the EEOC and DOJ have consulted on more than 125 
charges of discrimination under the auspices of the pilot project.10
EEOC Directed Investigations
Based on a recommendation from the task force, the EEOC is strengthen-
ing its emphasis to include systemic enforcement and litigation to address 
patterns of pay discrimination in particular industries, occupations, and geo-
graphic areas. Currently, the commission is focusing both on individual claims 
of pay discrimination with “strong litigation or educational potential” and patterns 
and practices of pay discrimination.
The EEOC is also using its authority to conduct directed investigations into 
suspected violations of the Equal Pay Act without individual charges of dis-
crimination. In April 2012, the commission launched the Equal Pay Act Directed 
Investigation Pilot Program, based on a recommendation from the task force.
Many details of the pilot program are unknown at the time of writing. The 
EEOC has not released information on how employers are selected for a 
directed investigation, nor have they indicated the methodology used in the 
audit process or what enforcement actions would be taken in the event pay 
disparities are found.
Based on the information that is available, the directed investigation begins with 
a meeting between the EEOC and the employer. At this meeting, the EEOC 
gathers information about the employer’s compensation practices: background 
on the types of compensation provided to employees, pay system(s) in use, 
compensation and review methods, retention and management of compensation 
data, and so on.

217
After this meeting, the EEOC constructs discovery and data requests. These 
requests are specific to the employer and are based on the information gath-
ered. The employer then responds with its data and document production.
Upon receipt of the data and document production, the EEOC reviews the 
information and performs the audit. If the audit reveals any violations, the 
commission will determine what enforcement actions (if any) will be pursued 
against the employer.
According to former EEOC Vice Chair Leslie Silverman, the tone of these 
meetings has been reported to be relaxed, cooperative, and nonadversarial.11 
Currently, three district offices are participating in the pilot program and are 
actively auditing employers: New York, Chicago, and Phoenix. If the project is 
successful, it may be expanded nationwide.12 
Federal–State–Local Cooperation
This interagency cooperation is also echoed in the DOL’s Strategic Plan 2011–
2016.13 According to the plan, worker protection agencies such as the OFCCP 
are reforming their operations to increase collaboration with other federal, 
state, and local agencies to ensure compliance throughout the workplace and 
impose penalties and other remedies consistent with the seriousness of the 
violation. 
Implications for Employers
The increased interagency cooperation on enforcement of equal pay laws 
means that information supplied to one agency could be turned over to 
another, leading to further scrutiny from additional regulatory bodies. 
For example, federal contractors should be aware that information relating 
to their employment policies—affirmative action plans, annual employment 
reports, compliance evaluation reports, investigative files, and so on—may 
be turned over to the EEOC for investigation under the Memorandum of 
Understanding between the EEOC and OFCCP. Individual complaint files and 
other information obtained by the EEOC may be turned over to OFCCP, 
which could precipitate the launch of systemic investigations.

Chapter 8 | The Changing Landscape of Pay Equity Enforcement
218
Increased interagency referrals and an overall emphasis on cooperation in 
enforcement of equal pay laws have implications for employers. From a risk 
management perspective, employers should be engaging in proactive exami-
nations of compensation with respect to internal pay equity. It is critical 
that employers understand what stories their compensation data sets tell. 
Employers should prepare for multidirectional scrutiny of their compensation 
policies and practices from regulatory agencies.
Education and Outreach
As articulated by the task force, education is critical to enforcement of equal 
pay laws: 
Educating employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities 
under our nation’s equal pay laws is essential to ending the pay gap. Many 
workers are unaware of their rights and of the fact that pay discrimination 
is still a problem in the twenty-first century American workplace.14
To address the need of educating employers on their obligations and employ-
ees on their rights under equal pay laws, the task force made the following 
recommendation in its Action Plan:
Undertake a public education campaign to educate employers on their 
obligations and employees on their rights. In addition, agencies will work 
to develop enhanced training programs for their employees charged with 
identifying, investigating, and prosecuting wage discrimination and will 
improve the accessibility of publicly available information.15
Public Education and Outreach
Since its formation, members of the task force have devoted considerable 
time and resources to educating the public about equal pay laws. For example, 
in January 2012, the DOL issued an Equal Pay App Challenge that invited 
developers to use publicly available data and resources to create applications 
that accomplished one of the following four goals:16

1.	 Provide greater access to pay data broken down by 
gender, race, and ethnicity that would be helpful to 
women throughout their careers as they negotiate 
starting pay, request a promotion or raise, or consider 
switching fields to a more lucrative career path;
2.	 Provide interactive tools for early career coaching, 
creating an interactive online experience to educate 
young women on the pay gap and enable informed 
decision making when selecting a career path;
3.	 Help inform negotiations by providing feedback, tips, 
and critiques that guide users through the process 
of negotiating starting salary, pay rate, job level, or 
requesting a promotion or raise, as well as educate 
users about their legal rights;
4.	 Promote online mentoring by expanding a person’s 
access to broader communities and mentorship 
opportunities and providing a means to connect with 
others for career guidance.
On April 17, 2012, Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis announced the four win-
ners of the Equal Pay App Challenge grand prize. The winning submissions, as 
described on the Equal Pay App Challenge website, are as follows.17
• 
Aequitas: a mobile personal career management solution 
that empowers users with current wage data, interview, 
résumé, and negotiation tools. It also provides wage and 
Equal Pay Act information and connects to equal pay–related 
social networks and discussions.
• 
Close the Wage Gap: a website designed to educate users 
about the gender wage gap and arm them with informa-
tion and negotiation tools to eliminate it. By merging data 
from multiple sources and tapping into the developers’ 
own negotiation know-how, the website provides inno-
vative ways to help users take steps toward closing the 
wage gap.
• 
Gender Gap App: designed to boost public awareness of 
the salary differences between men and women who 
are doing the same jobs. Data behind the app are taken 
directly from the U.S. Department of Labor.

• 
Demand Equal Pay for Women: an application that makes it 
easy for everyone to see how the pay gap affects nearly 
every woman in every industry. The app allows users to 
compare what they make with the national averages at 
the industry and occupational level, so users know how 
hard they need to push during salary negotiations.
The DOL’s Women’s Bureau launched its own version of an equal pay applica-
tion in its website. The Equal Pay Toolkit includes a White House Equal Pay 
Day Fact Sheet, a statement from Hilda Solis on Equal Pay Day, the Women’s 
Bureau Regional Data Fact Sheet Highlighting Women’s Earnings, and charts 
demonstrating the cumulative impact of the pay gap on women’s lifetime 
earnings.
These are just two of the many examples of the public education and out-
reach efforts undertaken to inform people about the pay gap and equal pay 
laws. Other agencies, such as the EEOC and the DOJ, are reviewing their 
educational tools and materials for employees and the general public and may 
develop new resources for training individuals on their rights under equal pay 
laws and how to identify potential compensation discrimination.
Agency Employee Education
Members of the task force are also revisiting the information available to their 
employees and other agencies responsible for enforcing equal pay laws. For 
example, the EEOC is reviewing its staff training materials to improve training 
for enforcement staff on how to use wage data to identify and assess wage dis-
parity cases, how to investigate wage discrimination charges, and the differences 
in analysis between an Equal Pay Act claim and a Title VII wage claim. 
The EEOC, DOJ, and OFCCP are engaging in joint staff training and cross-
training. The EEOC has created a new compensation discrimination training 
program, which was designed in consultation with OFCCP, the DOJ, and the 
Wage and Hour Division to address opportunities for improving efficiency 
and effectiveness through interagency collaboration in enforcement activities. 
As of March 2012, the EEOC had trained approximately 2,000 enforcement 
personnel from the EEOC, OFCCP, the Wage and Hour Division, and state 
and local civil rights agencies.
OFCCP is undertaking substantial efforts to enhance its training and edu-
cation of its field staff and managers. As noted in the “Equal Pay Task Force 
Accomplishments”:
In addition to participating in EEOC’s compensation discrimination 
training, OFCCP is developing improved and expanded protocols for its 
field staff to address a broader range of compensation issues and to 

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
221
identify and address discrimination in pay. OFCCP is devoting substantial 
resources to developing and implementing national and regional training 
for its managers and compliance officers on investigating and addressing 
equal pay issues.18
Member agencies of the task force are taking steps to improve training of 
their own employees, as well as cross-train employees of other member agen-
cies. These cross-training efforts also link back into the task force’s goal of 
increased interagency cooperation.
Employer Education and Outreach
The overall education and outreach campaign also includes resources for 
employers. For example, the EEOC, DOL, and DOJ are assessing their educa-
tional tools and materials for employers. They are evaluating the development 
of guidance on how to examine pay disparities in the workplace with respect 
to equal pay for equal work and occupational segregation by gender. 
The Women’s Bureau hosted a series of meetings with employers, federal 
contractors, and advocates to highlight available resources and educational 
materials. The bureau conducted four regional events focusing on equal pay 
issues and co-sponsored an additional thirty-four events in collaboration with 
the EEOC and OFCCP. 
The EEOC is focusing a significant amount of resources on employer training 
and education. In 2011, the commission’s Training Institute hosted a series of 
technical assistance seminars on equal pay. These seminars were designed to 
help employers learn how to comply with federal equal employment oppor-
tunity laws regarding compensation.
In its Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2012–2016, the EEOC announced plans 
for several new programs aimed specifically at areas of the employer com-
munity that are historically underserved, such as small businesses and new 
businesses.19 This focus is motivated at least in part by the agency’s belief that 
discrimination can be prevented through education and outreach. As stated  
by EEOC Commissioner Chai Feldblum:
Most employers that I meet want to comply with the law. The thing is, 
they’re also just trying to make a business happen. They have a lot of other 
things on their minds. . . . I’m going from the premise that employers would 
like to comply with the law. I’m also going from the premise that some 
things about the law are very simple and straightforward, and employers

Chapter 8 | The Changing Landscape of Pay Equity Enforcement
222
don’t actually need a lot of technical assistance. . . . But other aspects of 
the law are more complex, and therefore it is our job as an agency to 
make sure that employers understand what the law actually requires, so 
they can then make sure that their supervisors and their managers are 
applying the law correctly.20
The ability to partner with the EEOC on compliance efforts will be a signifi-
cant benefit to employers, particularly those in areas of the business community 
that are historically underserved.
Implications for Employers
The implications for employers of the focus on education and outreach are 
dual. First, more resources and information are now available for ­employers 
than have been in the past. The wider availability of technical guidance and 
compliance assistance will be beneficial as employers navigate the more 
­complex areas of equal employment law.
Second, employers should understand that their employees—and the general 
public—are more sensitive to equal pay issues as a result of recent education 
and outreach efforts. In some respects, these efforts have been disproportion-
ately directed at employees and the general public. Many messages used in 
the public education and outreach campaigns cite discrimination as the cause 
of any differences in compensation among employees. Employees may not 
understand that there are legitimate nondiscriminatory factors that account 
for differences between their compensation and that of their counterparts 
and jump to the conclusion that any difference is unfair and discriminatory.
To address this concern, it is important that compensation policies are trans-
parent and that employers clearly communicate compensation policies to 
employees. Compensation decisions should be based on a set of consistent 
and well-articulated factors. It should be clear to anyone reviewing the pol-
icy what factors and metrics are used in the compensation decision making 
process. It is important that the policies and decision making processes are 
communicated to employees in a concise and easily understandable manner. 
Employees should understand how their compensation is determined and 
what is expected of them to achieve the next merit increase or incentive 
payment.

Eleven-Cent Wage Differential among  
Federal Employees
According to a White House report regarding the accomplishments of the 
task force, “members have made notable progress in efforts to ensure equal 
pay in the federal workforce.”21 Specifically:
A joint memo from the EEOC and OPM was released to 
• 
federal employees, Chief Human Capital Officers, and EEO 
directors pledging the agencies’ commitment to rigorous 
enforcement of equal pay laws for federal employees;
Under the leadership of Commissioner Feldblum, the 
• 
EEOC is working closely with the OPM, GAO, and 
experts on pay equity to determine what additional data 
may be required to better understand the eleven cent 
wage differential among federal employees;
The OPM is continuing to evaluate the role of Federal 
• 
Women Program Managers and women in the Senior 
Executive Service (SES). The OPM is working with part-
ner agencies on a pilot project to increase diversity of 
applicants for certain SES positions.
The federal government is continuing to take steps toward improving its role 
as a model employer and eliminate the reported eleven cent per hour wage 
differential among federal employees. 
Understanding the Full Scope of the Wage Gap
The task force believes that part of the difficulty in identifying and combating 
compensation discrimination is the government’s inability to understand the 
full scope of the wage gap. This limited understanding, according to the task 
force, is attributable to insufficient information and data:
Private sector employers are not required to systematically report gender-
identified wage data to the federal government. This lack of data makes 
identifying wage discrimination difficult and undercuts enforcement efforts. 
We must identify ways to collect wage data from employers that are 
useful to enforcement agencies but do not create unnecessary burdens 
on employers.
21“Equal Pay Task Force Accomplishments,” p. 8.

Chapter 8 | The Changing Landscape of Pay Equity Enforcement
224
The task force believes that having access to more compensation data from 
employers will improve its understanding of the wage gap and allow regulatory 
agencies to better target enforcement efforts. To have access to these data, 
the task force recommended that the EEOC evaluate their data collection 
needs and capabilities and make modifications to existing EEO reports. The 
task force also recommended the reinstatement of the EO Survey or similar 
instrument. This recommendation has taken on the form of the OFCCP’s 
proposed compensation data collection tool.
EEOC Data and EEO Reports
The EEOC collects workforce data from all public and private employers with 
more than 100 employees. Currently, this information is collected through 
four separate EEO reports:
• 
EEO-1 Report, also known as the Employer Information 
Report, covers all private sector employers with 100 or 
more employees and reports the composition of their 
workforces by gender and race/ethnicity category;
• 
EEO-3 Report, also known as the Local Union Report, cov-
ers all local unions and reports the composition of their 
workforces by gender and race/ethnicity category;
• 
EEO-4 Report, also known as the State and Local 
Government Report, covers all state and local govern-
ments with 100 or more employees and reports the com-
position of their workforces by gender and race/ ethnicity 
category, as well as compensation information;
• 
EEO-5 Report, also known as the Elementary-Secondary 
Staff Information Report, covers all public elementary 
and secondary school districts with 100 or more employ-
ees and reports the composition of their workforces by 
gender and race/ethnicity category.
After reviewing the EEO reports in their current form, the EEOC has con-
cluded that there is no federal data source that has employer-specific wage 
data by demographic characteristics for private sector employees. Of the four 
EEO reports, only EEO-4, covering state and local governments, collects any 
wage-related information.
To remedy this, the EEOC is in the process of commissioning an outside study 
to determine what data it should collect to most effectively enhance its wage 
discrimination law enforcement efforts. OFCCP and EEOC are working col-
laboratively on evaluating data collection needs, capabilities, and tools to avoid 
duplicative efforts.

225
Reinstatement of EO Survey or Similar Instrument
With respect to the federal contracting community, the task force has rec-
ommended the reinstatement of the OFCCP Equal Opportunity Survey or a 
similar instrument. This recommendation encompasses not only the compen-
sation data and information federal contractors would be required to provide 
to OFCCP; it also extends to the analysis methodology OFCCP may use in 
the examination of that compensation data for systemic discrimination.
Original EO Survey 
Federal contractors falling under the auspices of the OFCCP may remember 
the original Equal Opportunity Survey that was implemented in 2000. The 
survey required contractors to provide information on their affirmative 
action programs and summary data on personnel activity and compensation.
The original survey had three main goals:
1.	 Increase compliance with equal opportunity require-
ments by improving contractor self-awareness and 
encouraging self-evaluation;
2.	 Improve the deployment of scarce federal government 
resources to those contractors who were most likely 
to be out of compliance;
3.	 Increase agency efficiency by building on the tiered-
review process already accomplished by OFCCP’s 
regulatory reform efforts, resulting in better resource 
allocations.
The original Equal Opportunity Survey was discontinued in 2006 after an 
independent consulting group determined that it was not a valid tool and did 
not predict systemic discrimination. OFCCP then published The Interpretive 
Standards for Systemic Compensation Discrimination, its final document regarding 
federal contractors’ examination of compensation practices with respect to 
gender, race, and ethnicity.22
22“The Interpretive Standards for Systemic Compensation Discrimination,” 71 Federal 
Register 35124, June 16, 2006.

Chapter 8 | The Changing Landscape of Pay Equity Enforcement
226
Interpretive Standards for Systemic Compensation Discrimination
The Standards outlined the methodology for OFCCP’s evaluation of contrac-
tors’ compensation practices during compliance reviews.23 The Standards were 
intended to provide, for the first time, a definitive interpretation of the 1978 
Sex Discrimination Guidelines, codified at 41 CFR 60-20, as well as Executive 
Order 11246 with respect to systemic compensation discrimination.
On August 17, 2010, OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu announced the agency’s 
intent to rescind the Standards. According to a Federal Register notice published 
in January 2011, the underlying reason for this was as follows:
OFCCP is proposing to rescind the Standards which have limited OFCCP’s 
ability to effectively investigate, analyze and identify compensation 
discrimination. In doing so, OFCCP will continue to adhere to the principles 
of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, (Title VII) in 
investigating compensation discrimination and will re-institute flexibility in 
its use of investigative approaches and tools.24
The notice also discussed OFCCP’s belief that the methodology outlined in the 
Standards, namely, multiple regression analysis of similarly situated employee 
groupings, is too “rigid”: 
The Standard’s mandate to use a multiple regression analysis to identify 
compensation discrimination is also overly narrow and is not required 
under Title VII principles. While a multiple regression analysis may be a 
useful tool in identifying compensation discrimination, other statistical or 
non-statistical analyses may be better suited, depending on the facts of 
the case.25
The notice goes on to say that if the Standards are rescinded, “OFCCP will 
re-institute the practice of exercising its discretion to develop compensation 
discrimination investigation procedures in the same manner it develops other

Even though the Standards have not formally been rescinded as of the date 
of this writing, the general consensus among experts is that the rescission 
will take place. When the Standards are officially rescinded, federal contrac-
tors will no longer have a roadmap to the kinds of analyses OFCCP will be 
performing on contractors’ compensation data. OFCCP will be free to select 
analysis tools and methodologies—statistical and nonstatistical, formal and 
informal—at will. This, coupled with the proposed Wage Data Collection Tool, 
poses serious concerns for federal contractors regarding the manipulation of 
increasing amounts of compensation data by OFCCP. 
Compensation Data Collection Tool
Based on the task force’s belief that insufficient compensation data exist to 
understand the full scope of the wage gap, OFCCP is proposing a new com-
pensation data collection tool. This tool would provide OFCCP with a greatly 
expanded database of contractor compensation information.
According to the OFCCP Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the  
purpose of the new compensation data collection tool is as follows: 
To provide insight into potential problems of pay discrimination by 
contractors that warrant further review or evaluation by OFCCP or 
contractor self-audit. Accordingly, it is envisioned primarily as a screening 
tool, although it may have research value. The tool would allow OFCCP to 
effectively and efficiently identify supply and service contractors whose 
compensation data indicated further investigation is necessary to ensure 
compliance with the non-discrimination requirements of the Executive 
Order and would provide contractors with a self-assessment tool that 
may be used periodically to evaluate the effects of their employee 
compensation decisions. The data collected through this tool may be used 
to identify contractors for compensation focused reviews as well as full 
compliance reviews.27
In the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking OFCCP sought comments 
from stakeholders and the business community on fifteen aspects of the  
compensation data collection tool:
1.	 What data or information should be collected to assess 
whether further investigation into the contractor’s 
compensation decisions and policies is necessary?
2.	 By what set of job categories should the data referred 
to in question 1 be collected?

Register 154, August 10, 2011.

3.	 What elements of compensation should be collected?
4.	 Is there a set of questions that would capture informa-
tion that would be helpful in understanding a contrac-
tor’s compensation system, such as policies relating 
to promotion decisions, bonuses, shift pay, setting of 
initial pay?
5.	 What type of compensation trend analyses would be 
appropriate to conduct on an industry-wide basis?
6.	 What specific categories of data would be most use-
ful for identifying contractors in specific industries for 
industry-focused compensation reviews?
7.	 What specific categories of data would be most useful 
for conducting compensation analyses across a con-
tractor’s various establishments?
8.	 What practical concerns might contractors have 
regarding responding to the compensation data 
request, and how do contractors currently record and 
maintain compensation data?
9.	 What specific categories of data would be most useful 
to contractors interested in conducting self-assessments 
of their compensation decisions?
10.	 What were the strengths and weaknesses of the com-
pensation section of the 2000 EO Survey?
11.	 What factors should OFCCP take into consider-
ation if contractors are required to submit data 
electronically?
12.	 What are the benefits and drawbacks of requiring 
businesses that are bidding on future federal contracts 
to submit compensation data as part of the request 
for proposal process?
13.	 Should OFCCP decide to expand the scope of the 
compensation data collection tool beyond supply and 
service contractors to include construction contrac-
tors, what factors or issues particularly relevant to 
such contractors should be kept in mind?
14.	 Are there other constructive suggestions for the 
design, content, analysis, and implementation of a 
compensation data collection tool?

15.	 OFCCP encourages small entities to provide data 
on how they may be affected by the requirement to 
provide the compensation data requested by the new 
data collection tool.
OFCCP is contemplating collecting the following data, some of which would 
be at a very granular level:
Number of employees in each gender and race/ethnicity 
• 
category
Average starting or initial compensation (including paid 
• 
leave, health and retirement benefits, etc.)
Average pay rate
• 
Average bonus payments
• 
Minimum and maximum salary
• 
Standard deviation or variance of salary
• 
Average compensation by job series
• 
Average employee tenure
• 
Total W-2 earnings
• 
Base salaries
• 
Hourly wage rates
• 
Holiday pay
• 
Shift differentials
• 
Commissions and bonus payments
• 
Paid leave
• 
Health benefits
• 
Retirement benefits
• 
Other elements of compensation
• 
Employers may be required to produce these data separately for each job 
category. Possible candidates for job categories include two- or three-digit 
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Codes, salary bands within EEO-1 cat-
egories, and individual job titles. It is also possible that employers would be 
required to produce employee-level data for all types of compensation and 
benefits.

Chapter 8 | The Changing Landscape of Pay Equity Enforcement
230
Additionally, employers may be required to produce their policies and proce-
dures for initial pay setting, shift pay, bonus decisions, promotion decisions, and 
any other decisions affecting compensation and benefits.
According to OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu, the agency received more than 
7,000 comments in response to the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 
She pointed out that many of the comments received “were not particularly 
constructive or helpful. . . . Many of them did not answer the questions we 
asked.”28 She acknowledged that the proposed data collection tool requires 
“a great deal of analysis.”29 The tool is still in the clearance phase. OFCCP 
continues to work on its development, so it is not yet clear whether the tool 
will be adopted and, if so, what its final form will be. 
The Solution Is Not More of the Same Data
OFCCP should be commended for its efforts at creating equal opportunity 
workplaces. Undoubtedly, compensation discrimination does exist, and OFCCP 
can—and should—play a role in ending discrimination. On its face, the com-
pensation data collection tool appears to be one way to accomplish this.
However, a close review of the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
leads to the conclusion that the OFCCP’s desire to collect compensation data 
is motivated by an inaccurate understanding of the question at hand: 
Women still earn only 77 cents for each dollar earned by a man. . . . 
Potentially non-discriminatory factors can explain some of these differences. 
Even so, after controlling for differences in skills and job characteristics, 
women still earn less than men. Some scholars find that these differences 
can be explained, to some extent, by differences in education and prior 
labor market experience. Others identify job segregation as an important 
cause of the pay gap. Ultimately, the research literature still finds that an 
unexplainable gap exists even after accounting for potential explanations. 
Moreover, research literature finds that the narrowing of the pay gap has 
slowed since the 1980s. To the extent that these factors, such as type of 
job or amount of continuous labor market experience, are also influenced 
by discrimination, the “unexplained” difference may understate the true 
effect of discrimination.

The argument is predicated on the assumption of discrimination. Although 
OFCCP acknowledges the vast body of research that indicates occupation, 
industry, labor market experience, and other factors explain a large portion of 
the gender pay gap, this research is dismissed.30 Yet the data points that would 
be collected by the compensation data collection tool are the same kinds of 
data points that have been examined in this body of research.
There is no doubt that the compensation data collection tool would provide 
OFCCP with an enormous volume of data, which could be used to detect 
patterns of discrimination. However, the tool would collect the same kinds of 
compensation data that have been collected and analyzed for years. Using this 
“traditional” compensation data, we still are unable to successfully predict and 
prevent discrimination.
To successfully predict and prevent discrimination, a different approach is 
required. An understanding of how compensation expectations are formed 
(and how they differ by gender), willingness to engage in compensation negoti-
ations, and the reasons underlying personal choices made by men and women 
are necessary to advance our understanding of the gender pay gap. Continuing 
to study greater volumes of the same kinds of data we have been studying for 
years is not likely to provide deeper insight into the causes of and potential 
solutions to the pay gap. 
Implications for Employers
The task force strongly believes that the inability to understand the full scope 
of the wage gap is attributable to insufficient information and data. As a result 
of this belief, the EEOC and OFCCP are considering measures to dramatically 
enhance the depth and breadth of employer compensation data collected. 
In terms of implications for employers, there are numerous open questions 
with respect to the collection of compensation data. The EEOC is studying 
its compensation data needs and evaluating how that information should be 
collected. It is unclear when and in what form the data collection tool will be 
approved and adopted. It is likely, however, that employers will be required 
to produce expanded compensation data to the EEOC and/or OFCCP in 
the near future. Employers should begin reviewing their document retention  
policies and data collection procedures to ensure that they are capturing 
comprehensive compensation and benefits information for all employees.
30Explanations of the gender pay gap, such as occupation, industry, labor market experience, 
and so forth, are explored in Chapter 9.

Existing Laws Provide Inadequate Tools
The task force believes that existing laws governing compensation discrimina-
tion, including the Equal Pay Act of 1963, do not provide federal officials with 
adequate tools to combat compensation discrimination.31 Loopholes exist in 
the act that provide employers with “unjustified defenses to their discrimina-
tory conduct.”32
The task force made the following recommendation to remedy this problem:
Although the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was an important historical milestone, 
it has not been updated since then, despite nearly half a century of legal 
and economic developments. The Paycheck Fairness Act would significantly 
enhance the Equal Pay Act. Among other things, the new law would allow 
women to receive the same remedies for sex-based pay discrimination 
as those available under some other laws to individuals subjected to race 
or national origin discrimination. The Act would bar retaliation against 
workers who disclose their wages, and would strengthen protections against 
wage discrimination by clarifying the scope of affirmative defenses. The 
Administration will continue working with lawmakers on this legislation 
and supporting its enactment.33
Task force members are hailing the Paycheck Fairness Act as a piece of legisla-
tion that has the potential to end compensation discrimination permanently.
The Paycheck Fairness Act
The Paycheck Fairness Act would augment the Equal Pay Act, allowing for 
an expanded definition of what constitutes pay discrimination and providing 
additional remedies for victims of pay discrimination.
The Equal Pay Act of 1963 specifically addresses defenses employers may use 
with respect to differences in compensation by gender:
No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section 
shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are 
employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to 
employees in such establishments at a rate less than the rate at which 
he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishments

for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, 
effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working 
conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority 
system, (ii) a merit system, (iii) a system which measures earnings by 
quantity or quality of production, or (iv) a differential based on any 
other factor other than sex. (emphasis added)
The Paycheck Fairness Act would change the “any factor other than sex” 
defense. Employers would be required to show that the pay differential is 
caused by (1) a bona fide factor other than sex, (2) that the factor is related to 
job performance, and (3) the factor is consistent with business necessity. 
From a practical standpoint, common sense tells us that men and women who 
are similarly situated (i.e., performance of equal work under similar working 
conditions on jobs requiring the same skill, effort, and level of responsibility) 
should be paid the same, and compensation decisions should in fact be based 
on legitimate factors consistent with business necessity.
Practical Implications of the Paycheck Fairness Act
When we look closely at the Paycheck Fairness Act, however, we see that 
it has some unusual implications for the way employers compensate their 
employees. For example, consider the following three scenarios:
A.	 John and Jane have identical characteristics (educa-
tion, work experience, etc.) and differ only by gender. 
ABC Company makes offers of employment to John 
and Jane on the same day, for identical positions, at 
the same starting salary of $45,000. Jane accepts the 
offer, but John negotiates the salary and ends up with 
a starting salary of $50,000.
B.	 Sam and Sally have the same education, work experi-
ence, and so on, and are both hired by WidgetCo on 
the same day for identical positions. The company sets 
both Sam’s and Sally’s starting salary at $2,500 more 
than they were earning at their previous jobs. Sam 
was earning $37,500 at his previous job, and Sally was 
earning $36,000. Their starting salaries at WidgetCo 
are $40,000 and $38,500, respectively.
C.	 Brad and Bridget both work for Alpha Inc.; have the 
same job title, same level of responsibility, and so on; 
and are earning $100,000 a year. Brad asks for a 5% 
raise, and Bridget does not. Brad gets the raise and 
ends up earning more than Bridget.

Chapter 8 | The Changing Landscape of Pay Equity Enforcement
234
In these three examples, the differences in pay are attributable to factors other 
than gender. In the first example, the difference is attributable to John’s nego-
tiation and Jane’s failure to negotiate. In the second example, the difference is 
attributable to differences in salary histories with previous employers. In the 
third example, the difference is due to Brad asking for a raise and Bridget’s 
failure to ask for a raise. The employers’ decisions are based on factors other 
than gender. Under the current equal pay laws, these scenarios are perfectly 
fine and the employers’ decisions would not be considered discriminatory.
Under the Paycheck Fairness Act, however, the outcome would be very dif-
ferent. An employer would have to demonstrate that its pay practices are 
divorced from any discrimination in its workplace or at the employee’s prior 
workplace, that the pay practice is job-related, and that the practice is consis-
tent with business necessity.
In Scenario A, under the Paycheck Fairness Act, ABC Company would be 
required to increase Jane’s starting salary to $50,000, the same as John’s nego-
tiated starting salary. The fact that Jane’s starting salary is lower than her male 
counterpart’s due to her failure to negotiate is not job-related. Most likely, 
this decision would be found not to be dictated by business necessity. Because 
ABC was willing to pay John $5,000 more than initially offered, the company 
should be willing to pay Jane the same amount for the same job. Under the 
Paycheck Fairness Act, ABC would have to adjust for Jane’s failure to negotiate 
and offer her the same $50,000 as if she had negotiated like John did. 
Note
■
 The Paycheck Fairness Act would require employers to adjust for differences in 
employees’ or candidates’ negotiation skills and willingness to engage in compensation negotiations.
In Scenario B, under the Paycheck Fairness Act, WidgetCo would be required 
to set Sam’s and Sally’s starting salaries at the same dollar amount of $40,000. 
The fact that Sally was earning less than Sam in her previous position, whether 
due to discrimination, market forces, and so on, is not related to her job at 
WidgetCo. As in the previous example, the pay decisions are most likely not 
dictated by business necessity. Assuming that Sally’s lower previous salary was 
due to discrimination by her former employer, WidgetCo would be required 
to adjust for the prior employer’s discrimination and increase her starting sal-
ary to that of Sam’s. 
Note
■
 The Paycheck Fairness Act would limit employers’ flexibility in addressing differences 
in employee and candidate salary histories and would require employers to remedy past 
discrimination by employees’ and candidates’ former employers.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
235
In Scenario C, under the Paycheck Fairness Act, Alpha Inc. would be required 
to give Bridget a 5% raise. The fact that her salary is now lower than Brad’s 
because she failed to ask for a raise is not job-related. As in the previous 
examples, the pay decisions are most likely not dictated by business necessity. 
Under the Paycheck Fairness Act, Alpha would have to increase Bridget’s pay 
by 5% as if she had asked for a raise like Brad did, even though she did not 
do so. 
Note

■
  The Paycheck Fairness Act would limit employers’ flexibility in addressing differences in 
employee salary demands and require employers to adjust for these differences in salary demands.
These are just three examples of how the Paycheck Fairness Act would sub-
stantially alter the way U.S. businesses are permitted to compensate their 
employees. The act would limit the flexibility of employers in addressing dif-
ferent salary histories, different salary demands, and so on. Businesses would 
have to make adjustments for any gender differences in negotiating skills, as 
well as willingness to engage in negotiations. They would also be required to 
right the wrongs of employees’ previous employers if those previous employers 
engaged in discriminatory pay-setting practices.
The Paycheck Fairness Act also has implications for compensation discrimina-
tion litigation. Specifically, it would make it easier for plaintiffs to bring class-
action lawsuits.34 Under the Equal Pay Act, plaintiffs must “opt in” to a class 
action by providing written consent. If an individual fails to provide written 
consent, he or she has not opted in and is not part of the class of plaintiffs.35 
Under the Paycheck Fairness Act, individuals would automatically be included 
in the class and would have to opt out if they did not want to be a party to 
the litigation.36 Under the Paycheck Fairness Act, employees would not need 
to affirmatively join a case to be included in the class action. Because of this, 
it would be easier for plaintiffs to bring class-action lawsuits on behalf of very 
large groups of employees.
34A class-action lawsuit is a form of lawsuit in which a large group of people collectively 
bring a claim to court and/or in which a group of defendants is being sued.
35The Equal Pay Act is governed by the procedural rules of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 
which requires opt-in.
36The Paycheck Fairness Act would permit “opt-out” class actions under Rule 23 of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Chapter 8 | The Changing Landscape of Pay Equity Enforcement
236
Furthermore, damages and penalties for employers who are found guilty of dis-
criminatory compensation decisions would be altered. The Equal Pay Act pro-
vides for equitable relief, such as back pay awards. Under the Paycheck Fairness 
Act, unlimited compensatory and punitive damages would be permitted.37
Supporters of the Paycheck Fairness Act have argued that this “common-
sense” piece of legislation has the power to end the gender pay gap—and 
gender discrimination—once and for all.
Unfortunately, the Paycheck Fairness Act is destined to fail in terms of ­delivering 
on this promise. As noted by one critic:
[The Paycheck Fairness Act] isn’t as commonsensical as it might seem. It 
overlooks mountains of research showing that discrimination plays little 
role in the pay disparities between men and women, and it threatens to 
impose onerous requirements on employers to correct gaps over which 
they have little control.38
As with OFCCP’s proposed compensation data collection tool, the argument 
in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act is predicated on the assumption of 
discrimination, despite the vast body of research indicating a variety of legiti-
mate, nondiscriminatory factors explaining a substantial portion of the gender 
pay gap.
Implications for Employers
It remains to be seen whether the Paycheck Fairness Act will be signed in to 
law. It has been introduced—and defeated—in Congress several times. There 
appears to be continued support for the Paycheck Fairness Act, and members 
of Congress have promised to reintroduce it in the current session. 
Organizations should review their compensation policies and practices 
to determine which, if any, would be affected by the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
Companies should begin making some contingency plans under the assump-
tion that the act will be signed in to law. The Paycheck Fairness Act has sweep-
ing implications for all businesses, and proactive employers will begin preparing 
for those implications now.
37Compensatory damages are awarded to compensate plaintiffs for loss or harm suffered. 
Punitive damages differ in that they are not awarded to compensate plaintiffs. They 
are awarded to punish the defendant(s) for outrageous conduct and discourage the 
defendant(s) from engaging in similar behavior in the future.

Causes of the 
Gender Pay Gap
Right now, women are a growing number of breadwinners in the household. 
But they’re still earning just 77 cents for every dollar a man does—even 
less if you’re an African American or Latina woman. Overall, a woman 
with a college degree doing the same work as a man will earn hundreds 
of thousands of dollars less over the course of her career. So closing this 
pay gap—ending discrimination—is about far more than simple fairness. 
When more women are bringing home the bacon, but bringing home less 
of it than men who are doing the same work, that weakens families, it weakens 
communities, it’s tough on our kids, it weakens our entire economy.
—President Barack Obama, April 6, 2012
The movement of women into the labor force has been referred to by some 
as the greatest social transformation of our time. Figure  9-1 presents the 
gender composition of the civilian labor force from 1960 to 2010. In 1960, 
approximately one out of three workers in the civilian labor force was female. 
By 2000, 47%—nearly half—was female.

This percentage has held steady: as of August 2012, approximately 47% of the 
labor force was female.1
More opportunities for women exist now than ever before, and the presence 
of women in a wide range of workplaces is common. Yet one issue that’s still 
being discussed is the gender pay gap.
The most commonly cited statistic in the current gender pay gap discussion 
is the “77 cents” statistic: women earn 77 cents for every $1 earned by their 
male counterparts.

This statistic is presented very frequently. It has been cited by White House 
Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett, Acting EEOC Chairman Stuart Ishimaru, Secretary 
of Labor Hilda Solis, and various scholars, academics, consultants, and prac-
titioners. The 77 cents statistic has been adduced as supporting evidence in 
discussions ranging from abstract theoretical musings on the role of women in 
society to concrete policy proposals such as the Paycheck Fairness Act.
The current administration has given gender pay equity a high priority. An 
interagency task force has been created, and one of their main objectives is to 
better understand the full significance of the gender wage gap.
All of the current administration’s work, however, is being driven by the  
77 cents statistic and the assumption that the 23 cents per hour differential 
is attributable to gender discrimination. The 77 cents statistic does not accu-
rately depict the real gender pay gap. It references the raw gender pay dispar-
ity and does not consider the impact of legitimate nondiscriminatory factors.
When one examines the gender wage gap accounting for legitimate nondis-
criminatory factors such as occupational choice, industry, work experience, 
hours worked, the cash/benefits trade-off, and so on, the pay gap significantly 
narrows. In fact, there may be no gender pay gap at all.
The 77 Cents Statistic 
In September 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau released its report on income, 
poverty, and health insurance coverage.2 In that report, they indicate that 
the 2008 and 2009 ratio of female-to-male earnings of full-time, year-round 
­workers fifteen years and older was 77%.3 This ratio is consistent with the 
findings of other research.4
The first thing that many people think of when they hear this statistic is that 
women earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by men because of discrimina-
tion. In actuality, the statistic tells us nothing about gender discrimination. One 
cannot automatically assume that an observed differential in the earnings of 
men and women is attributable to gender discrimination. More important,

77 percent is the raw earnings difference, and it fails to consider a variety of 
factors that create legitimate differences between the earnings of men and 
women.
A Closer Look 
As noted by Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, “some of the raw wage gap 
is due to differences in the measured characteristics of men and women.”5 
In fact, Blau and Kahn found that approximately 59% of the raw wage gap 
could be explained by factors such as occupational category, industry, work 
­experience, race, and union status. 
As shown in Figure 9-2, 27.4% of the raw wage gap is explained by occupa-
tional category. Industry category accounts for 21.9%, and labor force experi-
ence accounts for 10.5% of the raw wage gap. Union status and race account 
for 3.5% and 2.4% of the raw wage gap, respectively.

Blau and Kahn also found that accounting for education reduces the raw wage 
gap by 6.7%.6 This is consistent with research by the U.S. Department of 
Labor, which found that women were more likely than men to graduate from 
high school, more likely to attend college,7 and more likely to earn bachelor’s, 
graduate, and professional degrees.8
After controlling for occupational category, industry category, labor force 
experience, union status, and race, a different picture of the gender wage 
gap emerges: women earn 91 cents for every $1 earned by their male coun-
terparts. But this 9-cent differential is not automatically attributable to gen-
der discrimination. It’s likely that most—if not all—of this differential can be 
explained by looking at the choices individuals make.
In 2009, the Department of Labor commissioned a study on the gender wage 
gap.9 In the foreword to this report, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal 
Contract Compliance Charles James stated:
This study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in 
compensation between men and women are the result of a multitude of 
factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to 
justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The 
differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of individual 
choices being made by both male and female workers. (emphasis added)
Some of the choices that may contribute to the gender pay gap include ­differences 
in career interruptions, willingness to negotiate, compensation ­expectations, 
hours worked, and the cash-versus-benefits trade-off. 
6Women’s educational attainment has a positive effect on the gender wage gap. An editorial 
by Christina Hoff-Summers (New York Times, September 21, 2010) cited a study indicating 
that young, childless, single urban women earn 8% more than their male counterparts. This 
is largely attributable to the fact that more of the women in this demographic category 
earn college degrees compared to their male counterparts.

Occupational Differences 
Historically, men and women have worked in different occupations. This phe-
nomenon has been referred to by researchers as occupational selection, occu-
pational sorting, and occupational segregation. Although differences in the 
occupational choices of men and women have narrowed over the past thirty 
years, the differences persist. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
we can take a closer look at the gender pay gap by occupational category.10

twenty-two major occupational categories from BLS Report 1031:

Chapter 9 | Causes of the Gender Pay Gap
246
There are some key observations from Figures 9-3A through 9-3G:
Office and administrative support occupations employ 
• 
the most individuals (14% of the total workforce aged 
sixteen and older).
Farming, forestry, and fishing occupations employ the ­fewest 
• 
individuals (0.7%).
Health care support occupations have the largest per-
• 
centage of women (88%).
Construction and extraction occupations have the smallest 
• 
percentage of women (2%).
Office and administrative support occupations have the 
• 
largest ratio of female-to-male median weekly earnings 
(ratio = 93%).
Legal occupations have the largest difference between 
• 
female and male weekly earnings (ratio = 58%).
In all occupational categories, the ratio of female-to-male median weekly earn-
ings is less than one, meaning that the typical female in the given occupation 
earns less than her male counterpart in the same occupation.
The gender pay gap can be elucidated at a more granular level by looking 
at the various positions within a given occupational category. For example, 
within the legal category, which has the smallest ratio of female-to-male earn-
ings (58% as shown in Figure 9-3C), there are four subcategories: (a) lawyers; 
(b) judges, magistrates, and other judicial workers; (c) paralegals and legal 
assistants; and (d) miscellaneous legal support workers. The gender compo-
sition of these four subcategories is shown in Figure 9-4.

Chapter 9 | Causes of the Gender Pay Gap
248
An interesting pattern emerges when we look at the gender distribution 
within the four subcategories. Three out of every four men working in the 
legal category are lawyers (75%). On the other hand, nearly two out of every 
three women working in the legal category are paralegals, legal assistants, or 
legal support workers (62%). Only 35% of women working in the legal ­category 
are lawyers.
It should come as no surprise that the earnings of paralegals and legal assis-
tants are typically less than the earnings of lawyers. This example sheds light 
on why differences in the earnings of men and women still exist even when 
controlling for broader occupation category. If we were able to refine occupa-
tion sufficiently, it may be the case that more of the gender pay gap could be 
explained. 
Unfortunately, as we refine our definition of occupation further, less and less 
data are available, making gender comparisons of earning more difficult and 
less reliable.
Industry Differences 
Industry also plays a role in the gender pay gap. Figures 9-5A through 9-5D shows 
three pieces of information for each of the thirteen broad industry categories:11
The relative size of the occupational category, in terms of 
• 
total number of workers. This is represented by the size 
of the circle.
Female workers as a percentage of all workers in the occu-
•

The ratio of female-to-male median weekly earnings. This 
• 
is shown along the horizontal axis.

In all categories, the ratio of female-to-male median weekly earnings is less 
than one, meaning that the typical female in the given occupation earns less 
than her male counterpart in the same occupation.
As with occupation, the distribution of women within each of these industry 
categories at least partly explains the overall ratios of female-to-male earnings 
of less than one.
Judith Fields and Edward Wolff examined the size of the gender wage gap 
by industry.12 They found that in some industries the wage gap was positive, 
and in others the wage gap was negative. Another interesting finding is that 
industries that pay relatively high wages to men generally also pay relatively 
high wages to women. According to Fields and Wolff, industry can account  
for as much as 22% of the gender wage gap. Furthermore, the observed  
differences in the distributions of men and women among industries can 
account for an additional 19% of the raw wage gap. Fields and Wolff found that 
in total, ­industry can account for as much as 37% of the gender wage gap. 
Prior Work Experience 
Although there is consensus surrounding the observation that accounting for 
prior work experience reduces the size of the gender wage gap, research has 
shown that the way work experience is measured affects the amount of this 
reduction.
Not surprisingly, it has been empirically demonstrated that the actual amount 
of a person’s work experience accounts for a much larger portion of the gen-
der wage gap than does potential work experience.13 Potential work experi-
ence is often measured as the person’s age minus years of schooling, minus 
age when first attending school (usually assumed to be five or six).
Frequently, potential work experience is used as a proxy for actual work 
experience. Cases in which this proxy is commonly used include situations 
in which actual work experience is unknown or unavailable, available only in 
a form that is not conducive to formal analysis (e.g., hard-copy documenta-
tion), or situations in which creating a data set for actual work experience is 
prohibitive in terms of time and/or expense.

Gap,” Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 49 (October 1995), 105–20.

on Gender Wage Levels in the United States,” International Review of Applied Economics, 
19 (July 2005), 369–77.

Chapter 9 | Causes of the Gender Pay Gap
252
The problems with using potential work experience as a proxy for actual 
work experience are twofold. First, potential work experience may not reflect 
relevant actual work experience. If an individual changes from one occupation 
to another, and the skill sets and human capital requirements are different 
for those occupations, potential work experience is likely to overstate actual 
relevant work experience. 
Second, and perhaps more important to the current discussion, using poten-
tial work experience in a compensation model can introduce an artificial gen-
der bias. This artificial gender bias stems from the fact that women typically 
experience greater periods of absence from the labor force than men because 
of childbearing and child rearing. This can distort the true picture of compen-
sation equity.
Consider the following example. A thirty-five-year-old male employee and 
a thirty-five-year-old female employee hold the same job and have identical 
educational backgrounds. Both entered the labor force at age twenty-two, 
right after completing bachelor’s degrees. Assume that the male employee has 
thirteen years of prior relevant experience, and the female employee has eight 
years of relevant prior experience because she left the labor force after giv-
ing birth and did not return until her child began elementary school. Assume 
further that the male earns $2,500 per year more than the female employee, 
and we know with certainty that this $2,500 difference is attributable to the 
five-year difference in experience and nothing else.
Using potential work experience does not, and in fact cannot, account for the 
situation just described. Our calculation of potential work experience would 
indicate that both individuals have thirteen years of experience. If we compare 
the compensation of the male employee and the female employee and control 
for gender and potential work experience, the model will indicate that the 
$2,500 difference in earnings is attributable to gender. More specifically, one 
might infer that the difference is attributable to gender discrimination, when in 
fact the difference is attributable to differences in actual work experience. 
Hours Worked 
Contributing to the gender pay gap are differences in the number of hours 
usually worked during the week by men and women, shown in Figure 9-6.14

Figure 9-6.  Usual hours worked per week by gender
Not surprisingly, the majority of male and female employees usually work 
forty hours per week: 61% of men and 55% of women.
An interesting pattern emerges when we look at those employees who usu-
ally work more than forty hours per week: they are predominantly male. 
According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one in five men (20%) 
and only one in ten women (10%) usually work more than forty hours per 
week.
It logically follows that if men are generally working more hours—specifically 
more overtime hours—their earnings will be greater than the earnings of 
women.
This raises an interesting point about the way we measure the gender pay gap. 
The majority of empirical studies examines earnings, rather than pay rates. This 
could be distorting the real picture of gender pay equity. If men are choosing 
to work more overtime hours, as indicated in Figure 9-6, then even if male 
and female employees have the same base pay rate, the male employee’s earn-
ings will be greater than the female employee’s earnings, simply because of 
overtime pay.15
15This discussion assumes that overtime is granted to male and female employees equally, 
and the only difference in overtime actually worked is attributable to individual choice.

Chapter 9 | Causes of the Gender Pay Gap
254
Career Interruptions 
As mentioned previously, work experience explains a substantial amount of 
the gender pay gap. Empirical research has found that the continuity of work 
experience also plays an important role in earnings. Judy Goldberg Dey and 
Catherine Hill found that career interruptions, such as taking a leave for child-
birth or raising children, are associated with reduced earnings.16 They also 
found that these career interruptions were more prevalent among mothers 
than among fathers.17
The results of a study by Audrey Light and Manuelita Ureta indicate that after 
a career interruption of at least one year, the earnings of men decline approxi-
mately 25% on returning to work.18 The decline in earnings among women 
is approximately 23%. Interestingly, after a career interruption of at least one 
year, women’s earnings recover faster than men’s earnings.
Light and Ureta also found that the timing of career interruptions is impor-
tant. Based on their statistical analysis, they estimate that the differences in the 
frequency, duration, and scheduling of periods of nonemployment account for 
as much as 12% of the raw gender wage gap.
Negotiation 
Research indicates that there is a substantial difference by gender in the will-
ingness to engage in negotiations. Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever examined 
compensation negotiations by students graduating from professional schools.19
Women were significantly less likely than men to engage in negotiations to 
improve on the initial compensation offer. Only 7% of the female students 
attempted negotiation, compared to 57% of the male students. Babcock and 
Laschever also found that women are twice as likely as men to feel “a great 
deal of apprehension” about negotiating.

255
As noted by Hannah Bowles, Linda Babcock, and Lei Lai, women’s reluctance 
to initiate negotiations, as compared with men, may be an “important and 
underexplored explanation” for the gender pay gap.20
Negotiating styles also differ between men and women. Studies of simulated 
salary negotiations by Cynthia Stevens and colleagues and Vicki Kaman and 
Charmine Hartel indicate that on average, men negotiate more aggressively 
than women.21
This difference in style is likely a contributing factor to the differences in 
negotiation outcomes by gender. Barry Gerhart and Sara Rynes examined the 
negotiation behaviors and salary outcomes of graduating MBA students. They 
found that monetary returns to negotiation, in terms of starting salary, were 
lower for the female students than for their male counterparts.22
Compensation Expectations 
Intertwined with negotiation is compensation expectation. As noted by Mary 
Hogue and colleagues, pay expectations play a role in the gender pay gap.23 
Considerable empirical support exists for the notion that women set lower 
compensation goals than men. 
Differences in compensation expectations likely make up a contributing fac-
tor to women’s lower willingness to engage in negotiation, as well as lower 
compensation as a result of negotiation. 
Several studies of college students indicate that female students have lower 
compensation expectations than do male students. One study showed that 
women’s estimates of “fair pay” for their first job averaged 4% less than men’s 
estimates; the estimate of fair career-peak pay by women was 23% lower than

men’s estimates.24 Another survey of undergraduate business students found 
that women’s salary expectations were between 3% and 32% lower than the 
expectations of men for the same positions.25
Melissa Williams and colleagues conducted a study in which participants were 
given pairs of male and female first names and asked to estimate their salaries. 
Women, as well as men, tended to estimate significantly higher salaries for the 
male names than for the female names.26
William Sauser and C. Michael York found that despite the fact that women 
typically earn less than men in similar positions, women’s satisfaction with 
their pay tends to be equal to or greater than that of men.27
Cash versus Benefits Trade-off 
Benefits account for nearly 30% of total compensation, yet have been largely 
ignored in studies of the gender pay gap.28 Part of the reason benefits are 
disregarded stems from the fact that pay and benefits are interrelated. Fringe 
benefits are provided more frequently to employees with relatively high lev-
els of skill, job commitment, work experience, and job tenure.29 Employees 
with these characteristics also tend to receive higher levels of wages and 
salaries. This positive correlation makes empirical analysis difficult, and statis-
tical analysis methods and data sets must be developed to account for—and 
circumvent—this correlation. 
Eric Solberg and Teresa Laughlin conducted a study that accounted for this 
positive correlation.30 They estimated the size of the gender wage gap using 
only wages as the measure of earnings. They then reestimated the size of 
the gap using an index of total compensation that included not only wages

but nine types of fringe benefits.31 Solberg and Laughlin concluded that “any 
measure of earnings that excludes fringe benefits may produce misleading 
results as to the existence, magnitude, consequence, and source of market 
discrimination.”32
The Role of Discrimination
Legitimate factors such as occupation, industry, and prior work experience 
account for approximately 54% of the gender wage gap, reducing the raw dif-
ference of 33 cents per hour to an adjusted difference of 9 cents per hour.33 
When personal choices, career interruption patterns, willingness to engage in 
compensation negotiation, compensation expectations, hours worked, and the 
cash versus benefits trade-off are considered, this 9-cents-per hour difference 
is reduced even more.34
This is not to say, however, that gender pay discrimination does not take place. 
Unfortunately, discrimination is a workplace reality, and cases of gender pay 
discrimination do occur. As discussed in previous chapters, discrimination 
may be unintentional (disparate impact), or it may be intentional (disparate 
treatment).
Gender pay discrimination may play a role in explaining the wage gap, but 
it certainly does not explain the totality of the gap. In fact, even if the gap is 
not fully explained by the legitimate factors and personal choices researchers 
have identified to date, one cannot simply infer that any remaining differential 
is attributable to gender discrimination. It is possible that the remaining dif-
ferential is attributable to gender discrimination. But it is also possible that 
other factors not yet identified and/or incorporated into quantitative models 
of gender pay equity explain the remaining difference. 
31The nine categories of benefits included in the analysis are retirement benefits, life 
insurance benefits, medical benefits, dental benefits, training and education benefits,  
profit sharing, maternity/paternity benefits, flexible work hours, and employer-subsidized 
child care.

706.
33Blau and Kahn, “The Gender Pay Gap: Have Women Gone as Far as They Can?”
34The amount of reduction after considering these factors varies by researcher, groups of 
employees studied, and how the explanatory factors are defined and calculated. There is 
consensus across this research that these factors do explain a portion of the raw gender 
wage gap.

Litigation 
Avoidance  
and Proactive  
Self-Analysis
Self-analysis of internal pay equity is a valuable tool in the employer’s risk 
management toolbox. Unfortunately, few organizations make use of this strat-
egy. In light of the changing landscape of pay equity enforcement, coupled 
with dramatic increases in employment litigation and regulatory investigation, 
employers can no longer afford to ignore this important tool.
Importance of Litigation Avoidance
Employment practices liability claims are one of the most commonly faced 
risks by companies. According to Chubb’s 2010 Private Company Risk Survey, 
more than 20% of the employers they surveyed had experienced an employ-
ment-related lawsuit in the past five years.1 The median award in employment 
practices lawsuits in 2011 was $325,000, an increase of approximately 88%

from the previous year.2 If the employer is found guilty of discrimination, the 
average amount of punitive damages awarded is $2.7 million.3
These amounts do not include legal fees; 46% of companies surveyed by 
Chubb reported legal costs associated with employment litigation ranging 
from $20,000 to $750,000. 
In addition to private litigation, regulatory litigation is also increasing. According 
to Gerald Maatman, “government enforcement litigation has reached ‘white 
hot’ levels.”4 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has received 
more than 10,000 charges of wage discrimination since January 2010, of which 
about 40% alleged wage discrimination based on sex.5
Note

  Since January 2010, the EEOC has obtained more than $62.5 million in monetary relief 
through administrative enforcement for victims of sex-based wage discrimination, obtained changes 
to workplace practices that benefit over a quarter of a million workers, and filed five cases including 
sex-based wage discrimination claims.
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has rapidly 
increased the proportion of its work dedicated to addressing pay discrimi-
nation. The OFCCP has evaluated the pay practices of more than 10,000 
businesses that employ over 4.3 million workers since January 2010.6 During 
this same time period, the OFCCP closed more than fifty compliance evalu-
ations with financial settlements remedying compensation discrimination on 
the basis of gender and race. In doing so, the agency recovered $1.4 million in 
back pay and salary adjustments for more than 500 workers. In 2011, 20% of 
the OFCCP’s financial settlements resolved matters relating to compensation 
claims, a substantial increase over previous years.7 
Employment practices litigation poses serious risks for organizations of all 
sizes in all sectors of the economy. No company is immune. The damage 
from employment litigation can be severe. Chubb’s 2010 Private Company Risk 
Survey reported that “36% of the executives responded that an [employment 
practices liability] lawsuit would cause the most financial damage to their 
company.”

The nonfinancial costs of employment litigation are more difficult to express 
in terms of dollars but are just as significant:
The non-economic costs of employment litigation that can be independently 
taxing and not as measurable include current employee-witnesses spending 
significant time talking with the employer’s attorney(s), giving depositions 
or attending court proceedings in connection with the litigation instead of 
spending time conducting the business of the employer. In addition, the 
employer is required to gather and produce every document potentially 
relating to the plaintiff’s employment with the employer, including 
electronically stored documents (which can be an expensive and onerous 
burden for which the company may not be prepared). Finally, in some cases 
(particularly involving EEOC lawsuits), employment practices changes may 
actually be compelled through a consent decree.8
Given the significant financial and noneconomic costs associated with lawsuits 
and investigations, litigation avoidance should be a top priority for any orga-
nization. With respect to compensation-related litigation, one of the most 
effective strategies for prevention is a proactive compensation self-analysis.
Business Case for Proactive Self-Analysis
In Chapter 1, the business case for internal pay equity was presented. 
Socioeconomic arguments as well as strategic arguments and competitive 
advantages were discussed. Many of the same arguments apply to the business 
case for self-analysis. Self-analysis provides employers with the opportunity to 
identify and correct potential problem areas, thereby improving internal pay 
equity. This, in turn, allows them to leverage the competitive advantages asso-
ciated with internal pay equity, as well as mitigate the risk of litigation.
As previously noted, many organizations fail to take advantage of a proactive 
compensation self-analysis. The explanations for this failure range from the 
mundane to the psychologically elaborate. Some of the more common rea-
sons include:
Denial: “The whole issue is blown out of proportion. Internal 
pay equity is not as big a deal as our attorneys or the media 
make it. It’s not going to happen to us.” Companies ignore the 
possibility of compensation litigation happening to them 
and pretend that if they don’t acknowledge it, it isn’t real.
8David Nenni, “The Costs of Employment Litigation and the Benefits of Litigation Prevention 
and Employment Audits,” National Law Review, May 10, 2011.

Chapter 10 | Litigation Avoidance and Proactive Self-Analysis  
262
Making excuses: “I know we should do it, but we just 
don’t have the time/money/personnel/buy-in from senior 
management right now. It’s on our agenda, and we’re going 
to get to it as soon as we can.” The importance of this 
preventive measure is given lip service without any real 
commitment of resources to accomplish the task.
False sense of safety based on past events: “We’ve 
never had a problem before, so we won’t have a problem in 
the future.” Events that have not occurred in the recent 
past may be subjectively judged as having a lower prob-
ability of occurrence due to the availability heuristic.9
Overconfidence: “We don’t need to do that because I 
know we’re doing things equitably.” This response is more 
commonly associated with people who have compen-
sation decision-making authority. This response may 
come from a true sense of overconfidence: an over-
estimation of their knowledge, an underestimation of 
the risks, and an exaggerated sense of ability to control 
events. In other cases, this response will be produced 
by a perceived criticism of the person’s ability to carry 
out the duties and responsibilities of his job.
Dismissal of analysis utility: “We aren’t going to learn 
anything new about our compensation policies and prac-
tices by slicing and dicing the same data different ways.” 
Companies downplay the importance of these analyses 
and discount the information that they provide.
Fear: “What if we find problems? I could lose my job if we 
find problems! I’d rather not know.” The fear of finding 
potential inequities can be so paralyzing, companies forgo 
the proactive analysis, thereby eliminating any possibility 
of correcting potential problems prior to the com-
mencement of litigation or regulatory investigation.
Most of these explanations are unfounded and incorrect. The truth of the 
matter is that internal pay equity is a priority issue for regulatory agen-
cies, lawmakers, the plaintiff’s bar, and your employees. The possibility of 
compensation-related litigation or investigation is very real, and organiza-
tions need to take proactive steps to minimize this risk. The fact that an 
organization has never faced compensation-related litigation or investiga-
tion in the past does not immunize it from future scrutiny. Without taking 
a serious look at compensation policies and practices using quantitative

about the probability of events based on how easily they can think of examples.

263
tools, companies cannot be sure that problems don’t exist. A self-analysis 
provides the organization with an opportunity to identify any potential 
problem areas and take corrective action, where appropriate, before the 
situation escalates to litigation or regulatory investigation. 
With respect to the cost of performing a compensation self-review, it is true 
that such an analysis can be expensive in terms of time and money. However, if 
problems exist and are not detected, litigating and remedying those problems 
will be even more expensive. 
To illustrate this point, consider the following example.
AstraZeneca, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, will 
pay $250,000 to 124 women who were subjected to pay discrimination 
while working at the corporation’s Philadelphia Business Center in Wayne, 
Pa. The action resolves a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor in 
May 2010 alleging that the company discriminated against female sales 
specialists by paying them salaries that were, on average, $1,700 less 
than their male counterparts. . . .
Under a consent decree and order filed with the department’s Office of 
Administrative Law Judges, in addition to making financial restitution, the 
company has agreed to work with OFCCP to conduct a statistical analysis 
of the base pay of 415 individuals employed full time as “primary care” 
and “specialty care” level III pharmaceutical sales specialists in Alabama, 
Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North 
Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and 
the District of Columbia. If the analysis concludes that female employees 
continue to be underpaid, the company will adjust salaries accordingly.10
As noted in OFCCP’s June 2011 Events and News: “If AstraZeneca fails to 
comply with the consent decree, it may be subject to sanctions, including 
cancellation of its current federal contract, valued at more than $2 billion, and 
debarment from acquiring future ones.”
In thinking about the AstraZeneca timeline, the entire sequence of events 
could have been different had the company conducted a proactive self-analysis 
of compensation. In some respects, the timeline is backward. AstraZeneca is 
conducting a statistical analysis of compensation after an OFCCP investigation, 
in addition to paying $250,000 in settlement.
Had the company conducted a statistical analysis of compensation prior to 
the involvement of OFCCP, they would have been provided with an opportu-
nity to identify any potential problem areas and take corrective action where 
appropriate.
10“Pharmaceutical Giant AstraZeneca Agrees to Pay $250,000 to Settle Sex Discrimination 
Lawsuit Brought by US Department of Labor,” OFCCP News Release, Release Number 
11-0829-PHI, June 6, 2011.

Chapter 10 | Litigation Avoidance and Proactive Self-Analysis  
264
As noted previously, there are a variety of reasons companies fail to perform 
a self-analysis of compensation, and in many cases the financial cost comes in 
to play: “We simply can’t afford to do it right now.” The AstraZeneca situa-
tion suggests an interesting counterargument. As a result of the settlement 
decree, the company is required to perform a statistical analysis of the base 
pay rates of sales specialists in thirteen states and the District of Columbia. 
If this analysis reveals any disparities, they will be required to take remedial 
action and make appropriate adjustments. The cost of performing the analy-
sis and making necessary adjustments is in addition to the $250,000 paid in 
settlement. AstraZeneca did not realize any cost savings by failing to engage 
in a statistical analysis of compensation; under the consent decree they are 
required to perform this analysis.
Had AstraZeneca performed this statistical analysis prior to OFCCP involve-
ment, they likely would have spent the same amount on the analysis as they 
now have to spend, but could have avoided the additional $250,000 settlement 
payout. In the long run, performing a self-analysis of compensation would have 
saved AstraZeneca time and money.
In light of this example, one can see how the question of “Can we afford to 
do a compensation self-analysis right now?” easily becomes “Can we afford 
to not do a compensation self-analysis right now?” There is no question that 
a compensation self-analysis has nontrivial economic and noneconomic costs. 
But like many other preventive measures, proactively spending the resources 
on a self-analysis can—and often does—result in lower resource expendi-
tures on legal fees and fines in the future. Legal fees and fines are a drain on 
the organization; those resources are better used for growing the organiza-
tion and its employees. 
Required Data and Documentation
Once the decision has been made to conduct a compensation self-analysis, a 
thorough review of the organization’s compensation data and documentation 
should be undertaken. There are a variety of laws governing what compensa-
tion and benefits-related information companies must maintain; these laws 
also specify the period of time for which this information must be retained. 
Table  10-1 summarizes the types of information required by the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Labor (DOL), the Fair Labor 
Standards Act (FLSA), and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).11
11Other regulatory agencies and employment laws have data and document retention 
requirements as well. Examples include EEOC, Title VII, the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control 
Act, Executive Order 11246, Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act, and 
Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act. Some of these requirements involve compensation 
and benefits-related information, but they are largely concerned with hiring, promotion, 
termination, disability accommodation, workforce utilization, and so on.

Because the compensation and benefits-related information listed in Table 10-1  
is legally required, it is routinely maintained by employers as part of normal 
business operations. In addition to this information, there are supplementary 
data sets and documentation that employers should be maintaining but typi-
cally do not. This information is referred to as “compensation decision docu-
mentation.” As noted by Philip Miles: 
When you, as an employer, decide your employees’ wages, salaries, pay 
increases . . . how do you arrive at a specific figure? I’m talking about 
performance reviews—what metrics were used? Signed copies of the 
completed review, signed copies of the criteria at the start of the review 
period. Often companies will conduct or purchase industry statistics  
to ensure that they’re paying people in the expected range for their 
industry. . . . Employers are not ‘dart-boarding’ compensation decisions. 
Record where these figures are coming from.12
Compensation decision documentation, such as industry surveys, external 
benchmarks, the criteria used to evaluate employees (as well as any validation 
studies of those criteria) and complete copies of performance evaluations 
signed by the evaluator and the employee should be retained. Additionally, 
employee-specific data relating to criteria used in the compensation decision-
making process, such as educational attainment, certifications and licenses, 
continuing education activities, prior employment history, and so forth, should 
be retained. Finally, any data or documentation relating to special circum-
stances of particular employees (e.g., red circling) should be retained.
This information will facilitate a quantitative self-review of compensation, and 
also allow an assessment of whether the organization’s compensation policies 
and practices are being followed. 
The Compensation Self-Analysis
Conducting a self-analysis of compensation can seem like an overwhelming 
task. Breaking the self-evaluation into distinct phases can make the process 
more manageable. The following subsections describe the compensation self-
analysis in terms of ten discrete phases, as shown in Figure 10-1. Some of 
these phases (e.g., the construction of similarly situated employee groupings) 
were discussed at length in previous chapters. In these cases, only summaries 
of the key points will be provided.

1. Involve Legal Counsel
Any proactive or potentially self-critical study should be done under the 
auspices of legal counsel. It is imperative that legal counsel be involved in 
the compensation review. In-house counsel—and ideally outside counsel as 
well—should be involved from the very beginning. Attorneys who are familiar 
with compensation reviews and the laws governing internal pay equity should 
be brought on board as early in the process as possible.
The participation of legal counsel throughout the compensation review pro-
cess will, in most cases, allow the organization to take advantage of attor-
ney–client privilege and attorney work product protections. This can help 
maintain the confidentiality and nondiscoverability of the analyses.13 Ideally, all

correspondence, communication, data exchanges, and analysis results—especially 
if outside consultants are involved—should be handled through legal counsel.
2. Establish Goals
Having a clear understanding of what the organization hopes to accomplish by 
conducting a compensation review is essential. If the goals are clearly articu-
lated, the process of tailoring the analysis to achieve those goals is greatly 
simplified.
Commonly identified goals of a compensation review include:
Assessment of an organization’s exposure to compensa-
• 
tion discrimination litigation;
Assessment of an organization’s exposure to regulatory 
• 
investigation;
Assessment of internal pay equity of all employees, irre-
• 
spective of protected class status;
Integration of new employees as a result of a merger, 
• 
acquisition, or other corporate transaction;
Assessment of the correct execution of the organiza-
• 
tion’s compensation policies and practices;
Monitoring compensation as part of an organization’s 
• 
integrated risk management strategy.
Having a clear understanding of what the organization hopes to accomplish is 
critical to successfully designing and completing an analysis that provides the 
relevant conclusions and inferences.
3. Planning
During the planning phase, the groups of employees to be studied and the 
specific compensation metrics to be examined are defined. At this stage it is 
also important to determine which internal personnel will be involved and 
how outside counsel and consultants will be used.
Areas of the Organization to Be Studied
The first issue to be addressed during the planning stage is what area(s) of 
the organization will be studied. Depending on the goals of the compensation 
review, the analysis may be limited to a particular set of job titles, specific 
departments, locations within a specific geographic region, employees reporting 

Chapter 10 | Litigation Avoidance and Proactive Self-Analysis  
270
to a given supervisor, and so on. Having a well-defined study population will 
facilitate all of the other decisions made during the planning stage, including 
what aspects of compensation will be examined, who will be involved in the 
compensation review process, and what data are required.
The choice of study population will be guided by the underlying goals of the 
analysis. If the goal is to evaluate a new sales compensation plan that was 
recently implemented, the study population may be limited to the sales force. 
If there have been formal or informal complaints of pay inequities among a 
group of employees reporting to a particular supervisor, the study population 
may consist of that supervisor’s direct reports. If the goal is to construct an 
ongoing monitoring program for risk management purposes, the entire work-
force may be chosen as the study population.
Types of Compensation to Be Studied
As noted in Chapter 4, virtually any type of compensation paid to an employee 
can be examined with a statistical review. The choice of compensation metric 
will be governed by the study population.
Because different groups of employees are likely to receive different types 
of compensation, it is important to identify which types are appropriate for 
which groups. The choice of compensation metrics may differ across employee 
groupings; this is perfectly acceptable as long as the metrics are consistent 
within each employee grouping.
Internal and External Involvement
When planning a compensation review, it is important to determine who will be 
involved in the review process. A decision should be made as early as possible 
about the external and internal personnel who will be involved in the project. 
Making this decision early in the planning process has several distinct advantages.
As previously noted, it is preferable to involve outside legal counsel in the 
review process. It may also be useful to involve outside consultants to per-
form the statistical analysis. Aside from potentially offering an additional layer 
of privilege and confidentiality, a qualified outside consultant will have the 
required expertise, experience, and statistical tools to perform the analysis 
and assist in interpreting the analysis results.
One of the biggest concerns regarding compensation reviews is confidential-
ity within the organization. Limiting the involvement of internal personnel can 
address this concern directly. Only those individuals with instrumental knowl-
edge of compensation plans and those who will be directly involved in data 
collection and production should be involved. In most cases, these individuals 
will be senior human resources, payroll, and information systems employees.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
271
4. Construction of Similarly Situated Employee 
Groupings
Considerable time was spent in Chapter 4 discussing the construction of 
similarly situated employee groupings. It is worth reiterating, however, that the 
grouping of employees for analysis must be performed with the utmost care. 
Errors in groupings can render the results generated from a compensation 
review meaningless. 
Furthermore, the similarly situated employee groupings constructed by the 
employer serve as a memorialization of the organization’s view of its employ-
ees and the functions they serve. In the event of litigation or regulatory inves-
tigation, employers may be constrained to the definitions of similarly situated 
employee groupings previously used in internal analyses.
5. The Data
The compensation review hinges on data. After defining the groups of similarly 
situated employees, the determinants of compensation within each grouping 
should be identified. As previously noted, it may be the case that the deter-
minants of compensation differ by employee grouping. It is important to have 
a thorough understanding of which determinants of compensation apply to 
which groups of employees and to build these determinants into the compen-
sation review as appropriate.
The goal of collecting and assembling data for the compensation self-analysis 
is to construct a complete and comprehensive employee-level data set that 
captures all relevant information for each employee in the study population.14 
The relevant information will be defined by the determinants of compensa-
tion for each similarly situated employee grouping. It is not enough to simply 
extract each employee’s identification number and compensation amount; 
information regarding all of the determinants of compensation, as well as any 
other relevant information, must be collected. 
In most cases, the data phase (identification, collection, assembly, cleaning, and 
verification) consumes more time than any other phase of the self-review. 
Organizations will be well served to spend the time necessary to construct 
a complete and comprehensive data set before moving forward in the self-
review process. Gaps in the data or errors in the way the data set was con-
structed (e.g., missing explanatory factors, missing job codes, and so forth) 
will greatly increase the time required and financial expense of completing the 
compensation self-review.
14Note that the study population may include multiple similarly situated employee 
groupings.

Chapter 10 | Litigation Avoidance and Proactive Self-Analysis  
272
6. Model Building and Estimation
Choosing an appropriate model specification for the compensation self-anal-
ysis will be based on the goals of the analysis, the type(s) of compensation 
metrics being examined, the determinants of compensation, and other fac-
tors unique to the organization. There is no “one-size-fits-all” specification 
for compensation models. 
Multiple regression analysis is the preferred statistical technique for identify-
ing the presence or absence of compensation discrimination. Various specifi-
cations for multiple regression models (i.e., the classical model, the separate 
equations model, the interactive model, and the overall equity model) were 
presented in Chapter 5.
In cases where multiple regression analysis is inappropriate (e.g., the number 
of individuals in the similarly situated employee grouping is too small to permit 
multiple regression analysis), there are a variety of statistical and nonstatistical 
techniques available. 
The model specification chosen will dictate how the estimation process pro-
ceeds.15 The choice of model specification will also dictate which compensa-
tion questions can be answered. For example, choosing a separate equations 
structure in which the similarly situated employee grouping is stratified on 
the basis of gender can, by definition, provide no information regarding the 
presence or absence of discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity.16 The 
inferences drawn from and questions addressed by the analysis will depend 
partly on how the model is specified.
7. Evaluation of Results
As discussed in Chapter 3, there are five key aspects to consider in the evalu-
ation of the results from a multiple regression analysis: the magnitude (and 
direction) of the estimated coefficients, the statistical significance of the esti-
mated coefficients, the practical significance of the estimated coefficients, the 
size of the sample being analyzed, and the overall explanatory power of the 
model.
When interpreting regression results, it is essential to keep two points in 
mind. First, the results cannot be interpreted in a causal manner. A statistically 
15For example, the choice of the classical model structure will naturally lead to multiple 
regression analysis. The choice of a means test will lead to the performance of a t-test.
16It is not uncommon in practice to choose a class of model structure, such as separate 
equations, and estimate multiple specifications of the model for the same similarly situated 
employee grouping. For example, the first specification may be separate equations stratified 
by gender, the second specification may be separate equations stratified by race, and so on.

Compensating Your Employees Fairly
273
significant relationship between compensation and protected group status 
does not mean that protected group status causes compensation differences. 
Second, the nature of statistics themselves should be kept in mind when inter-
preting results. The results express the likelihood of certain outcomes, not 
whether certain outcomes will or will not occur. Even though an event may be 
very rare—such as getting ten heads in ten flips of a coin—and its associated 
likelihood is small, that likelihood is not zero.
8. Follow-Up Investigations
Analysis follow-up is a crucial step in the self-review process. Without proper 
follow-up, the opportunity to learn from the analysis—and the opportunity to 
correct potential problem areas—is lost.
As noted in Chapter 7, there are various methods of follow-up at both the 
systemic and individual employee levels. The choice of follow-up will be 
dictated by the results of the analysis. If follow-up investigations reveal a  
deficiency in the compensation model, such as the omission of a determinant 
of compensation or failure to account for red-circling, this deficiency should 
be addressed, and the model should be reestimated to assess whether the 
potential inequities originally observed are still present.
If no deficiencies in the compensation model are found, and no legitimate 
explanation for potential inequities are identified, it may be necessary to make 
modifications to compensation.
9. Testing Proposed Modifications to Compensation
Depending on what is learned during the follow-up investigations, modifica-
tions to compensation may be warranted. It is strongly recommended that 
before modifications are made, they are fully discussed with legal counsel 
and empirically tested.17 What may appear to be a minor change can have 
wide-sweeping implications for the compensation structure of the entire 
organization. It is essential to understand the ramifications of the proposed 
modifications prior to implementation.
17Typically, empirical testing of the proposed modifications is reestimation of the 
compensation model(s) substituting proposed compensation, rather than actual 
compensation, as the pay metric. For example, if compensation modifications are 
proposed for ten individuals within a similarly situated employee grouping of sixty 
employees, the model would be reestimated using proposed compensation amounts 
for the ten people for whom modifications are recommended and actual compensation 
amounts for the remaining fifty individuals in the similarly situated employee grouping.

Chapter 10 | Litigation Avoidance and Proactive Self-Analysis  
274
10. Making and Communicating Modifications  
to Compensation
As noted in Chapter 7, legal counsel should also be involved in planning how 
the compensation adjustments will be communicated to employees. The 
preferred communication approach will vary depending on the number of 
employees receiving adjustments, the magnitude of the necessary adjustments, 
and whether the employer has been (or is currently) involved in compensa-
tion-related litigation or regulatory investigation, among other factors.
Generally speaking, communication with employees about pay equity adjust-
ments should emphasize that the organization is committed to a fair and non-
discriminatory workplace. In an effort to provide a fair workplace, a review 
of compensation practices was performed, and that review uncovered poten-
tial inequities. The adjustments are being made to address those potential 
problem areas and to ensure that everyone—irrespective of protected group 
status—is paid fairly and equitably.
Conclusion
The compensation self-analysis is a valuable tool that can assist employers in 
managing the risk of compensation-related litigation and regulatory investiga-
tion. It can facilitate a deeper understanding of the organization’s compensa-
tion policies and practices and provide an empirical test of whether those 
policies and practices are being followed.

The Basics  
of Statistical 
Inference
Statistics is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the collection, presenta-
tion, and analysis of quantitative information. Generally speaking, there are two 
kinds of statistics: descriptive and inferential. Descriptive statistics summarize 
information; examples include averages, medians, minimums and maximums, 
percentages, charts, and graphs. Descriptive statistics are used to describe 
what is going on in the data.
Inferential statistics is concerned with drawing conclusions from data. An 
example that most people are familiar with is an opinion poll. The researcher 
selects a subgroup of people from the general population as his sample.   
He questions the sample members on how they feel about a particular issue. 
Then, based on the responses he collects from the sample, he makes a statisti-
cal inference regarding how the population as a whole feels about the issue.
Inferential statistics can also be used to make judgments about how likely it 
is that something will—or will not—occur. The simplest example of this is 
flipping a coin.
The Coin Flip Game
To see how inferential statistics works, let’s play a game. Let’s flip a coin ten 
times. For every head that comes up, you pay me $1. For every tail that comes 
up, I pay you $1.
A P P E N D I X 

Appendix | The Basics of Statistical Inference 
276
To make things more interesting, I go behind a screen and flip the coin ten 
times. I come back out from behind the screen, tell you that I got ten heads in 
ten flips, and ask you to pay me $10.
The question that you have to answer is whether you were cheated.
What evidence do you have? You might have direct evidence. For example, if 
there was a security camera recording me flipping the coin behind the screen, 
you could review the video footage. If the video revealed that I only got six 
heads out of ten flips, you would have direct evidence that I cheated you.
You could also inspect the coin. If you discovered that it was a two-headed 
coin, or that it was weighted toward heads, this would also be direct evidence 
that you were cheated.
But what if no direct evidence exists? What if there is no video footage, and 
you cannot physically inspect the coin? What evidence would you have to 
decide whether you were or were not cheated? How will you decide whether 
to pay me or accuse me of cheating?
Probability
You could use indirect evidence to decide if you were cheated. You know that 
the likelihood of getting one head in one flip of a fair coin is 50%. Based on 
that likelihood, you would expect that out of ten flips, heads would come up 
50% of the time. You would therefore expect five heads:
10 flips × 50% chance of heads = 5 expected heads
My reported result of ten heads in ten flips is five more than you would have 
expected. We have a surplus of five heads:
10 actual – 5 expected = surplus of 5 heads
Is this surplus of five heads big enough for you to feel comfortable with accus-
ing me of cheating?
If we flip a coin ten times, more often than not we will not see exactly five 
heads. We might get four heads or six heads. The question you have to answer 
is whether ten heads out of ten flips is unlikely enough that you feel comfort-
able of accusing me of cheating.
To answer this question, we can use probability. Probability is a way of express-
ing how likely it is that something will occur. Table A-1 shows the probabilities 
associated with our coin-flipping game.

Expected result
Starting at the bottom of this table, our expected result is five heads out of 
ten flips. The likelihood—or probability—of getting six heads out of ten flips 
is about 20% (0.205), or about one in five. The probability of getting seven 
heads out of ten flips is about 12% (0.117). The probability of getting eight 
heads out of ten flips is about 4% (0.044). The probability of getting nine heads 
out of ten flips is 1% (0.010). The probability of getting ten heads out of ten 
flips is 0.1% (0.001), or about one in a thousand.
Rather than reporting how likely it is that something will occur in percent-
ages and odds, social scientists often use something called standard deviation. 
Standard deviation is another way of expressing how likely it is that something 
would occur, or how far away from the expected outcome the actual result 
is. The greater the number of standard deviations, the further away from the 
expected result the actual outcome is, and the less likely we are to actually 
observe that outcome as a result of pure chance.
The probabilities in our coin flip game are drawn from the binomial distribution. 
These probabilities can be graphically represented as shown in Figure A-1.

Appendix | The Basics of Statistical Inference 
278
As we move further away from our expected result of five heads (which is in 
the middle of the distribution) to six heads, seven heads, and so on (or to four 
heads, three heads, and so on), the likelihood of getting that number of heads 
as a result of chance gets smaller and smaller. What does this tell you about 
the likelihood that you were cheated in our coin flip game?
It is important to note that just because the actual outcome of ten heads is 
different than the expected outcome of five heads, you cannot be 100% cer-
tain that you were cheated. Deviations from expected results can occur due 
to random chance.
It is possible that I did not cheat. In fact, we would expect to see ten heads in 
ten flips once every thousand games. In the probability graph, the number of 
times we expect to get ten heads (or, in the alternate, zero heads) is not zero.
The central issue is whether ten heads in ten flips is a “sufficiently rare” out-
come where the likely explanation is not random chance.
Statistical Significance
How rare is “sufficiently” rare? Where do we draw the line?
The general rule of thumb used by social scientists is that if the actual out-
come is likely to occur less than 5% of the time, which is approximately equal 
to two units of standard deviation, it is considered to be sufficiently rare. If an 
outcome is sufficiently rare, it is said to be statistically significant.
This rule of thumb has also been adopted by courts. In Hazelwood School 
District v. United States,1 the U.S. Supreme Court held that “a disparity of at 
least two or three standard deviations” is statistically significant.
Where does this leave us in terms of our coin flipping game? Are you going to 
pay me $10 or accuse me of cheating? Based on probability, the likelihood of 
getting ten heads in ten flips is one out of a thousand, or 3.10 units of standard 
deviation. This satisfies the rule of thumb used by social scientists and satisfies 
the threshold of two or three units established by the court in Hazelwood. 
The difference between my reported ten heads and the expected five heads is 
statistically significant. Thus, you would infer that I cheated you.
There is one important point to keep in mind about probability and statistical 
significance. Even if the difference between the actual and expected outcomes 
is adverse (that is, more heads than expected, fewer members of a protected 
group hired, higher salaries for men than for women), no adverse inference 
should be drawn unless the difference is statistically significant.
1Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299 (1977).

For example, if I reported getting eight heads out of ten flips, you would not 
infer (based on probability) that I cheated you. Although eight heads in ten 
flips is three more heads than expected, it is not a statistically significant differ-
ence. The standard deviation of that difference is 1.60 units. Because it does 
not meet that two or three unit threshold, you would conclude that it was not 
sufficiently rare enough to accuse me of cheating.
From a statistical perspective, a difference that is not statistically significant 
is not different from zero. No adverse inference should be drawn unless the 
difference is statistically significant.
Sample Size
Statistical significance is a function of the size of the observed disparity—such 
as the difference between the actual and expected number of heads in a coin 
flipping game. But it is also a function of the number of things being studied.
Let’s go back to our game, but instead of flipping the coin ten times, we are 
going to flip it just once. I go behind the screen, flip the coin, and tell you that 
it came up heads.
Do you think you were cheated? Probably not, because on that one flip there 
was a fifty-fifty chance of getting heads. You do not really have enough infor-
mation based on one flip of a coin to know whether you were cheated.
Now let’s flip the coin ten times, like in the original game. I go behind the 
screen, flip the coin ten times, and report that I got eight heads in ten flips. Do 
you think you were cheated?
We know from our probability table that eight heads out of ten flips is 
expected to occur about 4% of the time. The difference between eight actual 
heads and five expected heads is 1.60 units of standard deviation. Even though 
I got more heads than expected, the difference is not statistically significant. 
Therefore, you would not accuse me of cheating.
Let’s play the game again, only this time we will flip the coin 100 times. I go 
behind the screen, flip the coin 100 times, and report that I got 80 heads. Do 
you think you were cheated?
As shown in Table A-2, the difference between the actual eighty heads and 
expected fifty heads is equal to 6.09 units of standard deviation. This result is 
statistically significant, and you would therefore infer that you were cheated.

Appendix | The Basics of Statistical Inference 
280
In the ten-flip game, I got heads 80% of the time (eight heads out of ten flips). 
In the 100-flip game, I also got heads 80% of the time (80 heads out of 100 flips). 
Why is it that the same percentage of heads is not statistically significant in the 
10-flip game (1.60 units of standard deviation) but is significant in the 100-flip 
game (6.09 units of standard deviation)?
The answer has to do with the amount of information we have. Having 100 flips’ 
worth of information about the game tells us more than the information we 
get from a 10-flip game. Similarly, we have more information from a ten-flip 
game than we do from a one-flip game.
There is a complex statistical calculation at play here, which is not discussed. 
The takeaway is that the more information we have—the more things we are 
studying—the more powerful the statistical test becomes. The more power-
ful a statistical test, the more “certain” one can be about the likelihood that an 
observed disparity is or is not the likely outcome of chance.
As the sample size gets larger, smaller differences between the actual and 
expected outcomes become statistically significant. If we were to flip the coin 
an infinite number of times and heads occurred just once more than expected, 
that difference of one head would be statistically significant. Larger sample 
sizes mean more information, and more information means it is more likely 
that an observed difference will be statistically significant.
Practical Significance
When evaluating a difference between the actual and expected outcomes, 
statistical significance is used to determine if the outcome is sufficiently rare 
and unlikely to be the result of pure chance. There is an additional question 
that needs to be addressed in some circumstances: Is the observed difference 
big enough to be important from a practical perspective?
For example, assume that within a particular grouping of employees, a statisti-
cal analysis reveals that women’s annual earnings are lower than that of men.

Further assume that the difference in male and female annual earnings is  
$20 per year. Is the difference of $20 a year big enough to matter?
What if the difference was $2,000 a year, and the average annual earnings was 
$20,000 a year? Is a difference of $2,000 a year big enough to matter? What 
if the average annual earnings were $200,000—is the difference of $2,000 a 
year big enough to matter?
If an observed difference is big enough to matter, it is said to have practical 
significance. Unlike statistical significance, there is no generally accepted rule 
of thumb for practical significance. It is a question of judgment. One person 
might argue that a $20 difference in annual earnings between men and women 
is big enough to matter, but someone else may think it’s too small to be 
consequential.
Practical significance is subjective and depends on the perspectives of the indi-
vidual reviewer. However, it does play an important role in examining internal 
pay equity from a risk management perspective.

About the Author
Stephanie R. Thomas is the CEO of 
Thomas Econometrics Inc., a consulting service 
specializing in compensation gender equity, 
equal employment opportunity issues, and 
the quantitative examination of employment 
practices in the workplace. Her clients include 
Fortune 500 companies, small businesses, major 
law firms, and federal and state governments 
and agencies such as the Department of Justice 
and the FBI.
Formerly a New York University faculty 
member, Dr. Thomas speaks to legal groups, 
industry organizations, and the media on 
equal employment opportunity and affirmative 
action compliance issues, internal equity in compensation, and employment 
discrimination litigation avoidance. She is the author of Statistical Analysis 
of Adverse Impact. Her articles on compensation gender equity have been 
featured in many professional periodicals, including Bloomberg Law Reports, 
Corporate Counselor, and Journal of Compensation and Benefits. She was an 
expert commentator on National Public Radio discussing the gender wage 
gap and the Paycheck Fairness Act, and she is the host of The Proactive Employer 
radio show, the leading weekly broadcast dedicated to equal employment 
opportunity issues.
Dr. Thomas earned her PhD and MA in Economics from the New School for 
Social Research and her BA magna cum laude from Elmira College.

Acknowledgments
In many ways, this book is the culmination of 14 years of fieldwork on the 
topic of pay equity. During this time, I have had the opportunity to learn from 
colleagues, practitioners, and legal professionals too numerous for individual 
recognition. I have benefited greatly from our exchanges, whether friendly or 
adversarial, and I thank you. 
I am grateful to my fellow Compensation Café contributors for continually 
challenging my thinking on compensation: Ann Bares, E. James (Jim) Brennan, 
Chuck Czismar, Derek Irvine, Margaret O’Hanlon, Laura Schroeder, Dan 
Walter, and Jacque Vilet.
Thank you to my editors, Robert Hutchinson and Rita Fernando, for their 
invaluable guidance at every turn. Your capable hands made the publishing 
process not only efficient but enjoyable.
I am forever grateful for the support of my family. Special thanks are due to 
Gabrielle, equally gifted with the red pen and words of encouragement, for 
her judicious use of both.
