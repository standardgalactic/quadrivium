CHAPTER 1
Linear and multilinear algebra
In this chapter we will study the linear algebra required in representation theory. Some of
this will be familiar but there will also be new material, especially that on ‘multilinear’ algebra.
1. Basic linear algebra
Throughout the remainder of these notes k will denote a ﬁeld, i.e., a commutative ring with
unity 1 in which every non-zero element has an inverse. Most of the time in representation
theory we will work the ﬁeld of complex numbers C and occasionally the ﬁeld of real numbers
R. However, a lot of what we discuss will work over more general ﬁelds, including those of ﬁnite
characteristic such as Z/p for a prime p. Here, the characteristic of the ﬁeld k is deﬁned to be
the smallest natural number p ∈N such that p1 = 1+· · ·+1 = 0 if such a number exists then k
is said to have ﬁnite characteristic), otherwise it has characteristic 0. In the ﬁnite characteristic
case, the characteristic is always a prime.
1.1. Bases, linear transformations and matrices. Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional vector
space over k, i.e., a k-vector space. Recall that a basis for V is a linearly independent spanning
set for V . The dimension of V (over k) is the number of elements in any basis, and is denoted
dim| V . We will often view k itself as a 1-dimensional k-vector space with basis {1} or indeed
any set {x} with x ̸= 0.
Given two k-vector spaces V, W, a linear transformation (or linear mapping) from V to W
is a function ϕ: V −→W such that
ϕ(v1 + v2) = ϕ(v1) + ϕ(v2),
ϕ(tv) = tϕ(v),
for v1, v2, v ∈V and t ∈k. The set of all linear transformations V −→W will be denoted
Hom|(V, W). This is a k-vector space with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication
given by
(ϕ + θ)(u) = ϕ(u) + θ(u),
(tϕ)(u) = t(ϕ(u)) = ϕ(tu)
for ϕ, θ ∈Hom|(V, W) and t ∈k.
An important property of a basis is the following extension property.
Proposition 1.1. Let V, W be k-vector spaces with V ﬁnite dimensional, and {v1, . . . , vm}
a basis for V where m = dim| V . Given a function ϕ: {v1, . . . , vm} −→W, there is a unique
linear transformation Φ: V −→W such that
Φ(vj) = ϕ(vj)
(1 ⩽j ⩽m).
We can express this with the aid of the commutative diagram

□
When using this result we will refer to Φ as the linear extension of ϕ and often write ϕ.
Let V, W be ﬁnite dimensional k-vector spaces with bases {v1, . . . , vm} and {w1, . . . , wn},
where m = dim| V and n = dim| W. By Proposition 1.1, each function ϕij : {v1, . . . , vm} −→W
(1 ⩽i ⩽m, 1 ⩽j ⩽n) given by
ϕij(vk) = δikwj
(1 ⩽k ⩽m)
extends uniquely to a linear transformation ϕij : V −→W.
Proposition 1.2. The set of functions ϕij : V −→W (1 ⩽i ⩽m, 1 ⩽j ⩽n) is a basis
for Hom|(V, W). Hence
dim| Hom|(V, W) = dim| V dim| W = mn.
A particular and very important case of this is the dual space of V ,
V ∗= Hom(V, k).
Notice that dim| V ∗= dim| V . Given a basis {v1, . . . , vm} of V , V ∗has as a basis the set of
functions {v∗
1, . . . , v∗
m} which satisfy
v∗
i (vk) = δik,
where δij is the Kronecker δ-symbol for which
δij =
(
1
if i = j,
0
otherwise.
We can view this giving rise to an isomorphism V −→V ∗under which
vj ←→v∗
j .
If we set V ∗∗= (V ∗)∗, then there is an isomorphism V ∗−→V ∗∗under which
v∗
j ←→(v∗
j )∗.
Here we use the fact that the v∗
j form a basis for V ∗. Composing these two isomorphisms we
obtain a third V −→V ∗∗given by
vj ←→(v∗
j )∗.
In fact, this does not depend on the basis of V used, although the factors do! This is sometimes
called the canonical isomorphism V −→V ∗∗.
The set of all endomorphisms of V is
End|(V ) = Hom|(V, V ),

1. BASIC LINEAR ALGEBRA

which is a ring (actually a k-algebra, and also non-commutative if dim| V > 1) with addition
as above, and multiplication given by composition of functions. There is a ring monomorphism
k −→End|(V ) given by
t 7−→t IdV
which embeds k into End|(V ) as the subring of scalars. We also have
dim| End|(V ) = (dim| V )2.
Let GL|(V ) denote the group of all invertible k-linear transformations V −→V , i.e., the
group of units in End|(V ). This is usually called the general linear group of V or the group of
linear automorphisms of V and denoted GL|(V ) or Aut|(V ).
Now let v = {v1, . . . , vm} and w = {w1, . . . , wn} be bases for V and W. Then given a linear
transformation ϕ: V −→W we may deﬁne the matrix of ϕ with respect to the bases v and w
to be the n × m matrix with coeﬃcients in k,
w[ϕ]v = [aij],
where
ϕ(vj) =
n
X
k=1
akjwk.
Now suppose we have a second pair of bases for V and W, v′ = {v′
1, . . . , v′
m} and w′ =
{w′
1, . . . , w′
n}. Then we can write
v′
j =
m
X
r=1
prjvr,
w′
j =
n
X
s=1
qsjws,
for some pij, qij ∈k. If we form the m × m and n × n matrices P = [pij] and Q = [qij], then we
have the following standard result.
Proposition 1.3. The matrices w[ϕ]v and w′[ϕ]v′ are related by the formulæ
w′[ϕ]v′ = Qw[ϕ]vP −1 = Q[aij]P −1.
In particular, if W = V , w = v and w′ = v′, then
v′[ϕ]v′ = P v[ϕ]vP −1 = P[aij]P −1.
1.2. Quotients and complements. Let W ⊆V be a vector subspace. Then we deﬁne
the quotient space V/W to be the set of equivalence classes under the equivalence relation ∼on
V deﬁned by
u ∼v
if and only if
v −u ∈W.
We denote the class of v by v + W. This set V/W becomes a vector space with operations
(u + W) + (v + W) = (u + v) + W,
λ(v + W) = (λv) + W
and zero element 0 + W. There is a linear transformation, usually called the quotient map
q: V −→V/W, deﬁned by
q(v) = v + W.
Then q is surjective, has kernel ker q = W and has the following universal property.

4
1. LINEAR AND MULTILINEAR ALGEBRA
Theorem 1.4. Let f : V −→U be a linear transformation with W ⊆ker f. Then there is a
unique linear transformation f : V/W −→U for which f = f ◦q. This can be expressed in the
diagram
V

Â?

∃! f

in which all the sides represent linear transformations.
Proof. We deﬁne f by
f(v + W) = f(v),
which makes sense since if v′ ∼v, then v′ −v ∈W, hence
f(v′) = f((v′ −v) + v) = f(v′ −v) + f(v) = f(v).
The uniqueness follows from the fact that q is surjective.
□
Notice also that
(1.1)
dim| V/W = dim| V −dim| W.
A linear complement (in V ) of a subspace W ⊆V is a subspace W ′ ⊆V such that the
restriction q|W ′ : W ′ −→V/W is a linear isomorphism. The next result sums up properties of
linear complements and we leave the proofs as exercises.
Theorem 1.5. Let W ⊆V and W ′ ⊆V be vector subspaces of the k-vector space V with
dim| V = n. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
a) W ′ is a linear complement of W in V .
b) Let {w1, . . . , wr} be a basis for W, and {wr+1, . . . , wn} a basis for W ′. Then
{w1, . . . , wn} = {w1, . . . , wr} ∪{wr+1, . . . , wn}
is a basis for V .
c) Every v ∈V has a unique expression of the form
v = v1 + v2
for some elements v1 ∈W, v2 ∈W ′. In particular, W ∩W ′ = {0}.
d) Every linear transformation h: W ′ −→U has a unique extension to a linear transfor-
mation H : V −→U with W ⊆ker H.
e) W is a linear complement of W ′ in V .
f) There is a linear isomorphism J : V
∼
=
−→W × W ′ for which im J|W = W × {0} and
im J|W ′ = {0} × W ′.
g) There are unique linear transformations p: V −→V and p′ : V −→V for which
p2 = p ◦p = p,
p′2 = p′ ◦p′ = p′,
im p = W,
im p′ = W ′,
IdV = p + p′.
We often write V = W ⊕W ′ whenever W ′ is a linear complement of W. The maps p, p′ of
Theorem 1.5(g) are often called the (linear) projections onto W and W ′. This can be extended
to the situation where there are r subspaces V1, . . . , Vr ⊆V for which
V = V1 + · · · + Vr =

and we inductively have that Vk is a linear complement of (V1 ⊕· · · ⊕Vk−1) in (V1 + · · · + Vk).
A linear complement for a subspace W ⊆V always exists since we can extend a basis
{w1, . . . , wr} of W to a basis {w1, . . . , wr, wr+1, . . . , wn} for V and then take W ′ to be the
subspace spanned by {wr+1, . . . , wn}. Theorem 1.5(b) implies that W ′ is a linear complement.
2. Class functions and the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem
In this section k can be any ﬁeld. Let A = [aij] be an n × n matrix over k.
Definition 1.6. The characteristic polynomial of A is the polynomial (in the variable X)
charA(X) = det(XIn −[aij]) =
n
X
k=0
ck(A)Xk ∈k[X],
where In is the n × n identity matrix.
This polynomial is monic and of degree n in X. The coeﬃcients cr(A) ∈k are functions of
the entries aij. The following is an important result about this polynomial.
Theorem 1.7 (Cayley-Hamilton Theorem: matrix version). The matrix A satisﬁes
the polynomial identity
charA(A) =
n
X
k=0
ck(A)Ak = 0.
Example 1.8. Let
A =
·0
−1
1
0
¸
∈R[X].
Then
charA(X) = det
· X
1
−1
X
¸
= X2 + 1.
By calculation we ﬁnd that A2 + I2 = O2 as claimed.
Lemma 1.9. Let A = [aij] and P be an n × n matrix with coeﬃcients in k. Then if P is
invertible,
charPAP −1(X) = charA(X).
Thus each of the coeﬃcients ck(A) (0 ⩽k ⩽n) satisﬁes
ck(PAP −1) = ck(A).
Proof. We have
charPAP −1(X) = det(XIn −PAP −1)
= det(P(XIn)P −1 −PAP −1)
= det(P(XIn −A)P −1)
= det P det(XIn −A) det P −1
= charA(X).
Now comparing coeﬃcients we obtain the result.
□
This result shows that as functions of A (hence of the aij), the coeﬃcients ck(A) are invariant
or class functions in the sense that they are invariant under conjugation,
cr(PAP −1) = cr(A).

1. LINEAR AND MULTILINEAR ALGEBRA
Recall that for an n × n matrix A = [aij], the trace of A, Tr A ∈k, is deﬁned by
Tr A =
n
X
j=1
ajj.
Proposition 1.10. For any n × n matrix over k we have
cn−1(A) = −Tr A
and
cn(A) = (−1)n det A.
Proof. Calculating the coeﬃcient of Xn−1 in det(XIn −[aij]) we get
−
n
X
r=1
arr = −Tr[aij].
Putting X = 0 gives
cn(A) = det([−aij]) = (−1)n det[aij].
□
Now let ϕ: V −→V be a linear transformation on a ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space with
a basis v = {v1, . . . , vn}. Consider the matrix of ϕ relative to v,
[ϕ]v = [aij],
where
ϕvj =
n
X
r=1
arjvr.
Then the trace of ϕ with respect to the basis v is
Trv ϕ = Tr[ϕ]v.
If we change to a second basis w say, there is an invertible n × n matrix P = [pij] such that
wj =
n
X
r=1
prjvr,
and then
[ϕ]w = P[ϕ]vP −1.
Hence,
Trw ϕ = Tr
¡
P[ϕ]vP −1¢
= Trv ϕ.
Thus we see that the quantity
Tr ϕ = Trv ϕ
only depends on ϕ, not the basis v.
We call this the trace of ϕ.
We can similarly deﬁne
det ϕ = det A.
More generally, we can consider the polynomial
charϕ(X) = char[ϕ]v(X)
which by Lemma 1.9 is independant of the basis v.
Thus all of the coeﬃcients ck(A) are
functions of ϕ and do not depend on the basis used, so we may write ck(ϕ) in place of ck(A).
In particular, an alternative way to deﬁne Tr ϕ and det ϕ is as
Tr ϕ = cn−1(ϕ)
and
det ϕ = (−1)n det A.
We also call charϕ(X) the characteristic polynomial of ϕ. The following is a formulation of the
Cayley-Hamilton Theorem for a linear transformation.

2. CLASS FUNCTIONS AND THE CAYLEY-HAMILTON THEOREM
7
Theorem 1.11 (Cayley-Hamilton Theorem: linear transformation version).
If ϕ: V −→V is a k-linear transformation on the ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space V , then ϕ
satisﬁes the polynomial identity
charϕ(ϕ) = 0.
More explicitly, if
charϕ(X) =
n
X
r=0
cr(ϕ)Xr,
then
n
X
r=0
cr(ϕ)ϕr = 0
where ϕ0 = IdV .
There is an important connection between class functions of matrices such as the trace
and determinant and eigenvalues. It can be shown that for a complex square matrix A (or
more generally a matrix over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k), the distinct eigenvalues are the
distinct roots of the characteristic polynomial charA(X) (thus there are at most n distinct
eigenvalues). However, on factoring charA(X) into linear factors we can get repeated linear
factors, corresponding to ‘repeated’ roots. If a linear factor (X −λ) appears to degree d say, we
say that λ is an eigenvalue of multiplicity d. If every eigenvalue of A has multiplicity 1 then A
is diagonalisable in the sense that there is an invertible matrix P satisfying
PAP −1 = diag(λ1, . . . , λn),
the diagonal matrix with the n distinct diagonal entries λk down the leading diagonal. More
generally, let
(2.1)
charA(X) = (X −λ1) · · · (X −λn)
where now we allow some of the λj to be repeated. Then we can describe Tr A and det A in
terms of the eigenvalues λj.
Proposition 1.12. We have
Tr A =
n
X
j=1
λj
and
det A = (−1)nλ1 · · · λn.
Proof. This follows by considering the degree (n−1) and constant terms in Equation (2.1)
and using Proposition 1.10.
□
We can also apply the above discussion to a linear transformation ϕ: V −→V , where an
eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ ∈C is a non-zero vector v ∈V satisfying ϕ(v) = λv.
The characteristic polynomial may not be the smallest degree polynomial satisﬁed by a
matrix or a linear transformation. By deﬁnition, a minimal polynomial of an n × n matrix A or
linear transformation ϕ: V −→V is a (non-zero) monic polynomial f(X) of smallest possible
degree for which f(A) = 0 or f(ϕ) = 0.
Lemma 1.13. For an n × n matrix A or a linear transformation ϕ: V −→V , let f(X) be a
minimal polynomial and g(X) be any other polynomial for which g(A) = 0 or g(ϕ) = 0. Then
f(X) | g(X). Hence f(X) is unique.
Proof. We give the proof for matrices, that for a linear transformation is similar.
Suppose that f(X) ∤g(X). Then we have
g(X) = q(X)f(X) + r(X)

8
1. LINEAR AND MULTILINEAR ALGEBRA
where deg r(X) < deg f(X). Since r(A) = 0 and r(X) is of degree less than f(X), we have
a contradiction. Hence f(X) | g(X). In particular, if g(X) is of the same degree as f(X),
minimality of g(X) also gives g(X) | f(X), giving f(X) = g(X) as these are both monic.
□
We write minA(X) or minϕ(X) for the minimal polynomial of A or ϕ.
Note also that
minA(X) | charA(X) and minϕ(X) | charϕ(X).
3. Separability
Lemma 1.14. Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over C and ϕ: V −→V a linear
transformation. Suppose that
0 ̸= f(X) =
m
X
r=0
crXr ∈C[X]
is a polynomial with no repeated linear factors over C and that ϕ satisﬁes the relation
m
X
r=0
crϕr = 0,
i.e., for every v ∈V
,
m
X
r=0
crϕr(v) = 0.
Then there is a basis v = {v1, . . . , vn} of V consisting of eigenvectors of the linear transformation
ϕ.
Proof. By multiplying by the inverse of the leading coeﬃcient of f(X) we can replace
f(X) by a monic polynomial with the same properties, so we will assume that f(X) is monic,
i.e., cm = 1. Factoring over C, we obtain
f(X) = fm(X) = (X −λ1) · · · (X −λm),
where the λj ∈C are distinct. Put
fm−1(X) = (X −λ1) · · · (X −λm−1).
Notice that fm(X) = fm−1(X)(X −λm), hence (X −λm) cannot divide fm−1(X), since this
would lead to a contradiction to the assumption that fm(X) has no repeated linear factors.
Using long division of (X −λm) into fm−1(X), we see that
fm−1(X) = qm(X)(X −λm) + rm,
where the remainder rm ∈C cannot be 0 since then (X −λm) would divide fm−1(X). Dividing
by rm if necessary, we see that for some non-zero sm ∈C,
smfm−1(X) −qm(X)(X −λm) = 1.
Substituting X = ϕ, we have for any v ∈V ,
smfm−1(ϕ)(v) −qm(ϕ)(ϕ −λm IdV )(v) = v.
Notice that we have
(ϕ −λm IdV ) (smfm−1(ϕ)(v)) = smfm(ϕ)(v) = 0
and
fm−1(ϕ) (qm(ϕ)(ϕ −λm IdV )(v)) = qm(ϕ)fm(ϕ)(v) = 0.
Thus we can decompose v into a sum v = vm + v′
m where
(ϕ −λm IdV )(vm) = 0
and
fm−1(ϕ)(v′
m) = 0.

4. BASIC NOTIONS OF MULTILINEAR ALGEBRA
9
Let
Vm = {v ∈V : (ϕ −λm IdV )(v) = 0},
V ′
m = {v ∈V : fm−1(ϕ)(v) = 0}.
Thus we have shown that V = Vm + V ′
m. If v ∈Vm ∩V ′
m, then from above we would have
v = smfm−1(ϕ)(v) −qm(ϕ)(ϕ −λm IdV )(v) = 0.
So Vm ∩V ′
m = {0}, hence V = Vm ⊕V ′
m. We can now consider V ′
m in place of V , noticing that
for v ∈V ′
m, ϕ(v) ∈V ′
m, since
fm−1(ϕ)(ϕ(v)) = ϕ (fm−1(ϕ)(v)) = 0.
Continuing in this fashion, we eventually see that
V = V1 ⊕· · · ⊕Vm
where for v ∈Vk,
(ϕ −λk)(v) = 0.
If we choose a basis v(k) of Vk, then the (disjoint) union
v = v(1) ∪· · · ∪v(m)
is a basis for V , consisting of eigenvectors of ϕ.
□
The condition on ϕ in this result is sometimes referred to as the separability or semisimplicity
of ϕ. We will make use of this when discussing characters of representations.
4. Basic notions of multilinear algebra
In this section we will describe the tensor product of r vector spaces. We will most often
consider the case where r = 2, but give the general case for completeness. Multilinear algebra
is important in diﬀerential geometry, relativity, electromagnetism, ﬂuid mechanics and indeed
much of advanced applied mathematics where tensors play a rˆole.
Let V1, . . . , Vr and W be k-vector spaces. A function
F : V1 × · · · × Vr −→W
is k-multilinear if it satisﬁes
F(v1, . . . , vk−1, vk + v′
k, vk+1, . . . , vr) = F(v1, . . . , vk, . . . , vr) + F(v1, . . . , vk−1, v′
k, vk+1, . . . , vr),
(ML-1)
F(v1, . . . , vk−1, tvk, vk+1, . . . , vr) = tF(v1, . . . , vk−1, vk, vk+1, . . . , vr)
(ML-2)
for vj, v′
j ∈V and t ∈k. It is symmetric if for any permutation σ ∈Sr (the permutation group
on r objects),
F(vσ(1), . . . , vσ(k), . . . , vσ(r)) = F(v1, . . . , vk, . . . , vr),
(ML-S)
and is alternating or skew-symmetric if
F(vσ(1), . . . , vσ(k), . . . , vσ(r)) = sign(σ)F(v1, . . . , vk, . . . , vr),
(ML-A)
where sign(σ) ∈{±1} is the sign of σ.
The tensor product of V1, . . . , Vr is a k-vector space V1⊗V2⊗· · ·⊗Vr together with a function
τ : V1 × · · · × Vr −→V1 ⊗V2 ⊗· · · ⊗Vr satisfying the following universal property.
UP-TP: For any k-vector space W and multilinear map F : V1 × · · · × Vr −→W, there is a
unique linear transformation F ′ : V1 ⊗· · · ⊗Vr −→W for which F ′ ◦τ = F.

When V1 = V2 = · · · = Vr = V , we call V ⊗· · · ⊗V the rth tensor power and write Tr V .
The following result provides an explicit description of a tensor product.
Proposition 1.15. If the ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space Vk (1 ⩽k ⩽r) has a basis
vk = {vk,1, . . . , vk,nk}
where dim| Vk = nk, then V1 ⊗· · · ⊗Vr has a basis consisting of the vectors
v1,i1 ⊗· · · ⊗vr,ir = τ(v1,i1, . . . , vr,ir),
where 1 ⩽ik ⩽nk. Hence we have
dim| V1 ⊗· · · ⊗Vr = n1 · · · nr.
More generally, for any sequence w1 ∈V1, . . . wr ∈Vr, we set
w1 ⊗· · · ⊗wr = τ(w1, . . . , wr).
These satisfy the multilinearity formulæ
(MLF-1)
w1 ⊗· · · ⊗wk−1 ⊗(wk + w′
k) ⊗wk+1 ⊗· · · ⊗wr =
w1 ⊗· · · ⊗wk ⊗· · · ⊗wr + w1 ⊗· · · ⊗wk−1 ⊗w′
k ⊗wk+1 ⊗· · · ⊗wr,
(MLF-2)
w1 ⊗· · · ⊗wk−1 ⊗twk ⊗wk+1 ⊗· · · ⊗wr = t(w1 ⊗· · · ⊗wk−1 ⊗wk ⊗wk+1 ⊗· · · ⊗wr).
We will see later that the tensor power Tr V can be decomposed as a direct sum Tr V =
Symr V ⊕Altr V consisting of the symmetric and antisymmetric or alternating tensors Symr V
and Altr V .
We end with some useful results.
Proposition 1.16. Let V1, . . . , Vr be ﬁnite dimensional k-vector spaces. Then there is a
linear isomorphism
V ∗
1 ⊗· · · ⊗V ∗
r ∼= (V1 ⊗· · · ⊗Vr)∗.
In particular,
Tr(V ∗) ∼= (Tr V )∗.
Proof. Use the universal property to construct a linear transformation with suitable prop-
erties.
□
Proposition 1.17. Let V, W be ﬁnite dimensional k-vector spaces. Then there is a k-linear
isomorphism
W ⊗V ∗∼= Hom|(V, W)
under which for α ∈V ∗and w ∈W,
w ⊗α ←→wα
where by deﬁnition, wα: V −→W is the function determined by wα(v) = α(v)w for v ∈V .

4. BASIC NOTIONS OF MULTILINEAR ALGEBRA
11
Proof. The function W × V ∗−→Hom|(V, W) given by (w, α) 7→wα is bilinear, and
hence factors uniquely through a linear transformation W ⊗V ∗−→Hom|(V, W). But for bases
v = {v1, . . . , vm} and w = {w1, . . . , wn} of V and W, then the vectors wj ⊗v∗
i form a basis of
W ⊗V ∗. Under the above linear mapping, wj ⊗v∗
i gets sent to the function wjv∗
i which maps
vk to wj if k = i and 0 otherwise. Using Propositions 1.2 and 1.15, it is now straightforward to
verify that these functions are linearly independent and span Hom|(V, W).
□
Proposition 1.18. Let V1, . . . , Vr, W1, . . . , Wr be ﬁnite dimensional k-vector spaces, and
for each 1 ⩽k ⩽r, let ϕk : Vk −→Wk be a linear transformation. Then there is a unique linear
transformation
ϕ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ϕr : V1 ⊗· · · ⊗Vr −→W1 ⊗· · · ⊗Wr
given on each tensor v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vr by the formula
ϕ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ϕr(v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vr) = ϕ1(v1) ⊗· · · ⊗ϕ1(vr).
Proof. This follows from the universal property UP-TP.

1. The Isomorphism and Correspondence Theorems
The three Isomorphism Theorems and the Correspondence Theorem are fundamental results
of Group Theory. We will use the notations H ⩽G and N ◁G to indicate that H is a subgroup
and N a normal subgroup of G.
Recall that given a normal subgroup N ◁G the quotient group G/N has for its elements the
distinct cosets
gN = {gn ∈G : n ∈N}
(g ∈G).
Then the natural mapping π: G −→G/N given by
π(g) = gN
is a surjective homomorphism with kernel ker π = N.
Theorem 2.1 (1st Isomorphism Theorem). Let ϕ: G −→H be a homomorphism with
N = ker ϕ.
Then there is a unique homomorphism ϕ: G/N −→H such that ϕ ◦π = ϕ.
Equivalently, there is a unique factorisation
ϕ: G π−→G/N
ϕ−→H.

Theorem 2.2 (2nd Isomorphism Theorem). Let H ⩽G and N ◁G.
Then there is an
isomorphism
HN/N ∼= H/(H ∩N);
hn ←→h(H ∩N).
Theorem 2.3 (3rd Isomorphism Theorem). Let K ◁G and N ◁G with N ◁K.
Then
K/N ⩽G/N is a normal subgroup, and there is an isomorphism
G/K ∼= (G/N)/(K/N);
gK ←→(gN)(K/N).

2. RECOLLECTIONS AND REFORMULATIONS ON BASIC GROUP THEORY
Theorem 2.4 (Correspondence Theorem). There is a one-one correspondence between sub-
groups of G containing N and subgroups of G/N, given by
H ←→π(H) = H/N,
π−1Q ←→Q,
where
π−1Q = {g ∈G : π(g) = gN ∈Q}.
Moreover, under this correspondence, H ◁G if and only if π(H) ◁G/N.
2. Some deﬁnitions and notation
Let G be a group.
Definition 2.5. The centre of G is the subset
Z(G) = {c ∈G : gc = cg ∀g ∈G}.
This is a normal subgroup of G, i.e., Z(G) ◁G.
Definition 2.6. Let g ∈G, then the centralizer of g is
CG(g) = {c ∈G : cg = gc}.
This is a subgroup of G, i.e., CG(g) ⩽G.
Definition 2.7. Let H ⩽G. The normalizer of H in G is
NG(H) = {c ∈G : cHc−1 = H}.
This is a subgroup of G containing H; moreover, H is a normal subgroup of NG(H), i.e.,
H ◁NG(H).
Definition 2.8. G is simple if its only normal subgroups are G and {e}. Equivalently, it
has no non-trivial proper subgroups.
Definition 2.9. The order of G, |G|, is the number of elements in G when G is ﬁnite, and
∞otherwise. If g ∈G, the order of g, |g|, is the smallest natural number n ∈N such gn = e
provided such a number exists, otherwise it is ∞. Equivalently, |g| = | ⟨g⟩|, the order of the
cyclic group generated by g. If G is ﬁnite, then every element has ﬁnite order.
Theorem 2.10 (Lagrange’s Theorem). If G is a ﬁnite group, and H ⩽G, then |H| divides
|G|. In particular, for any g ∈G, |g| divides |G|.
Definition 2.11. Two elements x, y ∈G are conjugate in G if there exists g ∈G such that
y = gxg−1.
The conjugacy class of x is the set of all elements of G conjugate to x,
{y ∈G : y = gxg−1 for some g ∈G}.
Conjugacy is an equivalence relation on G and the distinct conjugacy classes are the distinct
equivalence classes.

3. GROUP ACTIONS
15
3. Group actions
Let G be a group (with identity element eG) and X a set. Recall that an action of G on X
is a rule assigning to each g ∈G a bijection ϕg : X −→X and satisfying the identities
ϕgh = ϕg ◦ϕh,
ϕeG = IdX .
We will frequently make use of the notation
g · x = ϕg(x)
(or even just write gx) when the action is clear, but sometimes we may need to refer explicitly
to the action. It is often useful to view an action as corresponding to a function
Φ: G × X −→X; ϕ(g, x) = ϕg(x).
It is also frequently important to regard an action of G as corresponding to a group homomor-
phism
ϕ: G −→Perm(X);
g 7→ϕg,
where Perm(X) denotes the group of all permutations (i.e., bijections) of the set X. If n =
{1, 2, . . . , n}, then Sn = Perm(n) is the symmetric group on n-objects, and has order n!.
Given such an action of G on X, we have the following deﬁnitions:
Stabϕ(x) = {g ∈G : ϕg(x) = x},
Orbϕ(x) = {y ∈X : for some g ∈G, y = ϕg(x)},
XG = {x ∈X : gx = x ∀g ∈G}.
Then Stabϕ(x) is called the stabilizer of x and is often denoted StabG(x) when the action is
clear, while Orbϕ(x) is called the orbit of x and is often denoted OrbG(x). XG is called the
ﬁxed point set of the action.
Theorem 2.12. Let ϕ be an action of G on X, and x ∈X.
(1) Stabϕ(x) is a subgroup of G. Hence if G is ﬁnite, then so is Stabϕ(x) and moreover
by Lagrange’s Theorem, | Stabϕ(x)| | |G|.
(2) There is a bijection
G/ Stabϕ(x) ←→Orbϕ(x);
g Stabϕ(x) ↔g · x = ϕg(x).
Furthermore, this bijection is G-equivariant in the sense that
hg Stabϕ(x) ↔h · (g · x).
In particular, if G is ﬁnite, then so is Orbϕ(x) and we have
| Orbϕ(x)| = |G|/| Stabϕ(x)|.
The distinct orbits partition X into a disjoint union of subsets,
X =
a
distinct
orbits
Orbϕ(x).
Equivalently, there is an equivalence relation ∼
G on X for which the distinct orbits are the
equivalence classes and given by
x∼
Gy
⇐⇒
for some g ∈G, y = g · x.
Hence, if X is ﬁnite, then
|X| =
X
distinct
orbits
| Orbϕ(x)|

16
2. RECOLLECTIONS AND REFORMULATIONS ON BASIC GROUP THEORY
This theorem is the basis of many arguments in Combinatorics and Number Theory as well
as Group Theory. Here is an important example, often called Cauchy’s Lemma.
Theorem 2.13 (Cauchy’s Lemma). Let G be a ﬁnite group and let p be a prime for which
p | |G|. Then there is an element g ∈G of order p.
Proof. Let
X = Gp = {(g1, g2, . . . , gp) : gj ∈G, g1g2 · · · gp = eG}.
Let H be the group of all cyclic permutations of the set {1, 2, . . . , p}; this is a cyclic group of
order p. Consider the following action of H on X:
γ · (g1, g2, . . . , gp) = (gγ−1(1), gγ−1(2), . . . , gγ−1(p)).
It is easily seen that this is an action. By Theorem 2.12, the size of each orbit must divide
|H| = p, hence must be 1 or p since p is prime. On the other hand,
|X| = |G|p ≡0
(mod p),
since p | |G|. Again by Theorem 2.12, we have
|X| =
X
distinct
orbits
| OrbH(x)|,
and hence
X
distinct
orbits
| OrbH(x)| ≡0
(mod p).
But there is at least one orbit of size 1, namely that containing e = (eG, . . . , eG), hence,
X
distinct
orbits not
containing e
| OrbH(x)| ≡−1
(mod p).
If all the left hand summands are p, then we obtain a contradiction, so at least one other orbit
contains exactly one element. But such an orbit must have the form
OrbH ((g, g, . . . , g)) ,
gp = eG.
Hence g is the desired element of order p.
□
Later, we will meet the following type of action. Let k be a ﬁeld and V a vector space over
k. Let GL|(V ) denote the group of all invertible k-linear transformations V −→V . Then for
any group G, a homomorphism of groups ρ: G −→GL|(V ) deﬁnes a k-linear action of G on V
by
g · v = ρ(g)(v).
This is also called a k-representation of G in (or on) V . One extreme example is provided by
the case where G = GL|(V ) with ρ = IdGL|(V ). We will be mainly interested in the situation
where G is ﬁnite and k = R or k = C; however, other cases are important in Mathematics.
If we have actions of G on sets X and Y , a function ϕ: X −→Y is called G-equivariant or
a G-map if
ϕ(gx) = gϕ(x)
(g ∈G, x ∈X).
An invertible G-map is called a G-equivalence (it is easily seen that the inverse map is itself
a a G-map).
We say that two G-sets are G-equivalent if there is a G-equivalence between
them. Another way to understand these ideas is as follows. If Map(X, Y ) denotes the set of all
functions X −→Y , then we can deﬁne an action of G by
(g · ϕ)(x) = g(ϕ(g−1x)).

5. SOLVABLE GROUPS
17
Then the ﬁxed point set of this action is
Map(X, Y )G = {ϕ : gϕ(g−1x) = ϕ(x) ∀x, g} = {ϕ : ϕ(gx) = gϕ(x) ∀x, g}.
So MapG(X, Y ) = Map(X, Y )G is just the set of all G-equivariant maps.
4. The Sylow theorems
The Sylow Theorems provide the beginnings of a systematic study of the structure of ﬁnite
groups. For a ﬁnite group G, they connect the factorisation of |G| into prime powers,
|G| = pr1
1 pr2
2 · · · prd
d ,
where 2 ⩽p1 < p2 < · · · < pd with pk prime, and rk > 0, to the existence of subgroups of
prime power order, often called p-subgroups. They also provide a sort of converse to Lagrange’s
Theorem.
Here are the three Sylow Theorems. Recall that a proper subgroup H < G is maximal if
it is contained in no larger proper subgroup; also a subgroup P ⩽G is a p-Sylow subgroup if
|P| = pk where pk+1 ∤|G|.
Theorem 2.14 (Sylow’s 1st Theorem). A p-subgroup P ⩽G is maximal if and only if
it is a p-Sylow subgroup. Hence every p-subgroup is contained in a p-Sylow subgroup.
Theorem 2.15 (Sylow’s 2nd Theorem). Any two p-Sylow subgroups P, P ′ ⩽G are
conjugate in G.
Theorem 2.16 (Sylow’s 3rd Theorem). Let P ⩽G be a p-Sylow subgroup with |P| = pk,
so |G| = pkm where p ∤m. Also let np be the number of distinct p-Sylow subgroups of G. Then
np ≡1
(mod p);
(i)
m ≡0
(mod np).
(ii)
Finally, we end with an important result on chains of subgroups in a ﬁnite p-group.
Theorem 2.17. Let P be a ﬁnite p-group. Then there is a sequence of subgroups
{e} = P0 ⩽P1 ⩽· · · ⩽Pn = P,
with |Pk| = pk and Pk−1 ◁Pk for 1 ⩽k ⩽n.
We also have the following which can be proved directly by the method in the proof of
Theorem 2.13.
Theorem 2.18. Let P be a non-trivial ﬁnite p-group. Then the centre of P, Z(P), is non-
trivial.
Sylow theory seemingly reduces the study of structure of a ﬁnite group to the interaction
between the diﬀerent Sylow subgroups as well as their internal structure. In reality, this is just
the beginning of a diﬃcult subject, but the idea seems simple enough!
5. Solvable groups
Definition 2.19. A group G which has a sequence of subgroups
{e} = H0 ⩽H1 ⩽· · · ⩽Hn = G,
with Hk−1 ◁Hk and Hk/Hk−1 cyclic of prime order, is called solvable (soluble or soluable).

18
2. RECOLLECTIONS AND REFORMULATIONS ON BASIC GROUP THEORY
Solvable groups are generalizations of p-groups in that every ﬁnite p-group is solvable. A
ﬁnite solvable group G can be thought of as built up from the abelian subquotients Hk/Hk−1.
Since ﬁnite abelian groups are easily understood, the complexity is then in the way these sub-
quotients are ‘glued’ together.
More generally, for a group G, a series of subgroups G = G0 > G1 > · · · > Gr = {e} is
called a composition series for G if Gj+1 ◁Gj for each j, and each successive quotient group
Gj/Gj+1 is simple. The quotient groups Gj/Gj+1 (and groups isomorphic to them) are called
the composition factors of the series, which is said to have length r. Every ﬁnite group has
a composition series, with solvable groups being the ones with abelian subquotients. Thus, to
study a general ﬁnite group requires that we analyse both ﬁnite simple groups and also the ways
that they can be glued together to appear as subquotients for composition series.
6. Product and semi-direct product groups
Given two groups H, K, their product G = H × K is the set of ordered pairs
H × K = {(h, k) : h ∈H, k ∈K}
with multiplication (h1, k1) · (h2, k2) = (h1h2, k1k2), identity eG = (eH, eK) and inverses given
by (h, k)−1 = (h−1, k−1).
A group G is the semi-direct product G = N ⋊H of the subgroups N, H if N ◁G, H ⩽G,
H ∩N = {e} and HN = NH = G. Thus, each element g ∈G has a unique expression g = hn
where n ∈N, h ∈H. The multiplication is given in terms of such factorisations by
(h1n1)(h2n2) = (h1h2)(h−1
2 n1h2n2),
where h−1
2 n1h2 ∈N by the normality of N.
An example of a semi-direct product is provided by the symmetric group on 3 letters, S3.
Here we can take
N = {e, (123), (132)},
H = {e, (12)}.
H can also be one of the subgroups {e, (13)}, {e, (23)}.
7. Some useful groups
In this section we deﬁne various groups that are useful as test examples in the theory we will
develop. Some of these will be familiar although the notation may vary from that in previous
encounters with these groups.
7.1. The quaternion group. The quaternion group of order 8, Q8, has as elements the
following 2 × 2 complex matrices:
±1, ±i, ±j, ±k,
where
1 =
·1
0
0
1
¸
= I2,
i =
·i

−i
¸
,
j =
· 0

−1
0
¸
,
k =
·0
i

0
¸
.
7.2. Dihedral groups.
Definition 2.20. The dihedral group of order 2n D2n is generated by two elements α, β of
orders |α| = n and |β| = 2 which satisfy the relation
βαβ = α−1.
The distinct elements of D2n are
αr, αrβ
(r = 0, . . . , n −1).
Notice that we also have αrβ = βα−r.
A useful geometric interpretation of D2n is provided by the following.

8. SOME USEFUL NUMBER THEORY
19
Proposition 2.21. The group D2n is isomorphic to the symmetry group of a regular n-
gon in the plane, with α corresponding to a rotation through 2π/n about the centre and β
corresponding to the reﬂection in a line through a vertex and the centre.
7.3. Symmetric and alternating groups. The symmetric group on n objects Sn is best
handled using cycle notation. Thus, if σ ∈Sn, then we express σ in terms of its disjoint cycles.
Here the cycle (i1 i2 . . . ik) is the element which acts on the set n = {1, 2, . . . , n} by sending
ir to ir+1 (if r < k) and ik to i1, while ﬁxing the remaining elements of n; the length of this
cycle is k and we say that it is a k-cycle. Every permutation σ has a unique expression (apart
from order) as a composition of disjoint cycles, i.e., cycles with no common entries. We usually
supress the cycles of length 1, thus (123)(46)(5) = (123)(46).
It is also possible to express a permutation σ as a composition of 2-cycles; such a decompo-
sition is not unique, but the number of the 2-cycles taken modulo 2 (or equivalently, whether
this number is even or odd, i.e., its parity) is unique. The sign of σ is the number
sign σ = (−1)number of 2-cycles.
Theorem 2.22. The function sign: Sn −→{1, −1} is a surjective group homomorphism.
The kernel of sign is called the alternating group An and its elements are called even per-
mutations, while elements of Sn not in An are called odd permutations. Notice that |An| =
|Sn|/2 = n!/2. Sn is the disjoint union of the two cosets eAn = An and τAn where τ ∈Sn is
any odd permutation.
Here are the elements of A3 and S3 expressed in cycle notation.
A3 :
e = (1)(2)(3), (123) = (13)(12), (132) = (12)(13).
S3 :
e, (123), (132), (12)e = (12), (12)(123) = (1)(23), (12)(132) = (2)(13).
8. Some useful Number Theory
In the section we record some number theoretic results that are useful in studying ﬁnite
groups. These should be familiar and no proofs are given. Details can be found in the book
[JBF] or any other basic book on abstract algebra.
Definition 2.23. Given two integers a, b, their highest common factor or greatest common
divisor is the highest positive common factor, and is written (a, b). It has the property that
any integer common divisor of a and b divides (a, b).
Definition 2.24. Two integers a, b are coprime if (a, b) = 1.
Theorem 2.25. Let a, b ∈Z. Then there are integers r, s such that ra + sb = (a, b). In
particular, if a and b are coprime, then there are integers r, s such that ra + sb = 1.
More generally, if a1, . . . , an are pairwise coprime, then there are integers r1, . . . , rn such
that
r1a1 + · · · + rnan = 1.
These are consequences of the Euclidean or Divison Algorithm for Z.
EA: Let a, b ∈Z. Then there are unique q, r ∈Z for which 0 ⩽r < |b| and a = qb + r.
It can be shown that in this situation, (a, b) = (b, r). This allows a determination of the
highest common factor of a and b by repeatedly using EA until the remainder r becomes 0,
when the previous remainder will be (a, b).


CHAPTER 3
Representations of ﬁnite groups
1. Linear representations
In discussing representations, we will be mainly interested in the situations where k = R or
k = C. However, other cases are important and unless we speciﬁcally state otherwise we will
usually assume that k is an arbitrary ﬁeld of characteristic 0. For ﬁelds of ﬁnite characteristic
dividing the order of the group, Representation Theory becomes more subtle and the resulting
theory is called Modular Representation Theory. Another important property of the ﬁeld k
required in many situations is that it is algebraically closed in the sense that every polynomial
over k has a root in k; this is true for C but not for R, however, the latter case is important in
many applications of the theory. Throughout this section, G will denote a ﬁnite group.
A homomorphism of groups ρ: G −→GL|(V ) deﬁnes a k-linear action of G on V by
g · v = ρgv = ρ(g)(v),
which we call a k-representation or k-linear representation of G in (or on) V . Sometimes V
together with ρ is called a G-module, although we will not use that terminology. The case where
ρ(g) = IdV is called the trivial representation in V . Notice that we have the following identities:
(hg) · v = ρhgv = ρh ◦ρgv = h · (g · v)
(h, g ∈G, v ∈V ),
(Rep-1)
g · (v1 + v2) = ρg(v1 + v2) = ρgv1 + ρgv2 = g · v1 + g · v2
(g ∈G, vi ∈V ),
(Rep-2)
g · (tv) = ρg(tv) = tρg(v) = t(g · v)
(g ∈G, v ∈V, t ∈k).
(Rep-3)
A vector subspace W of V which is closed under the action of elements of G is called a G-
submodule or G-subspace; we sometimes say that W is stable under the action of G. It is usual
to view W as being a representation in its own right, using the ‘restriction’ ρ|W : G −→GL|(W)
deﬁned by
ρ|W (g)(w) = ρg(w).
The pair consisting of W and ρ|W is called a subrepresentation of the original representation.
Given a basis v = {v1, . . . , vn} for V with dim| V = n, for each g ∈G we have the associated
matrix of ρ(g) relative to v, [rij(g)] which is deﬁned by
(Rep-Mat)
ρgvj =
n
X
k=1
rkj(g)vk.
Example 3.1. Let ρ: G −→GL|(V ) where dim| V = 1. Then given any non-zero element
v ∈V (which forms a basis for V ) we have for each g ∈G a λg ∈k satisfying g · v = λgv. By
Equation (Rep-1), for g, h ∈G we have
λhgv = λhλgv,
and hence
λhg = λhλg.
From this it is easy to see that λg ̸= 0. Thus there is a homomorphism Λ: G −→k× given by
Λ(g) = λg.
21

22
3. REPRESENTATIONS OF FINITE GROUPS
Although this appears to depend on the choice of v it is in fact independent of it (exercise). As
G is ﬁnite, every element g ∈G has a ﬁnite order |g|, and hence we also have
λ|g|
g = 1,
which we also leave as an exercise. This says that λg is a |g| th root of unity. Hence, given a
1-dimensional representation of a group, we can regard it as equivalent to such a homomorphism
G −→k×.
Example 3.2. As examples of the above, let us consider the following situations.
a) Take k = R. Then the only roots of unity in R are ±1, hence we can assume that
for a 1-dimensional representation over R, Λ: G −→{1, −1}, where the codomain is a
group under multiplication. An interesting example of this is provided by the sign of
permutations, sign: Sn −→{1, −1}.
b) Now take k = C. Then for each n ∈N we have n distinct nth roots of unity in C×. We
will denote the set of all nth roots of unity by µn, and the set of all roots of unity by
µ∞=
[
n∈N
µn,
where we use the inclusions µm ⊆µn whenever m|n. These are abelian groups under
multiplication.
Given a 1-dimensional representation over C, the function Λ can be viewed as a
homomorphism Λ: G −→µ∞, or even Λ: G −→µ|G| by Lagrange’s Theorem.
For example, if G = C is cyclic of order N say, then we must have for any 1-
dimensional representation of C that Λ: C −→µN. Note that there are exactly N of
such homomorphisms.
Example 3.3. Let G be a simple group which is not abelian. Then given a 1-dimensional
representation ρ: G −→GL|(V ) of G, the associated homomorphism Λ: G −→µ|G| has abelian
image, hence ker Λ has to be bigger than {eG}. Since G has no proper normal subgroups, we
must have ker Λ = G. Hence, ρ(g) = IdV .
Indeed, for any representation ρ: G −→GL|(V ) we have ker ρ = G or ker ρ = {eG}. Hence,
either the representation is trivial or ρ is an injective homomorphism, which therefore embeds
G into GL|(V ). This severely restricts the smallest dimension of non-trivial representations of
non-abelian simple groups.
Example 3.4. Let G = {e, τ} ∼= Z/2 and let V be any representation over any ﬁeld not of
characteristic 2. Then there are k-vector subspaces V+, V−of V for which V = V+ ⊕V−and
the action of G is given by
τ · v =
(
v
if v ∈V+,
−v
if v ∈V−.
Proof. Deﬁne linear transformations ε+, ε−: V −→V , by
ε+(v) = 1
2 (v + τ · v) ,
ε−(v) = 1
2 (v −τ · v) .
It is easily veriﬁed that
ε+(τ · v) = ε+(v),
ε−(τ · v) = −ε−(v).
We take V+ = im ε+ and V−= im ε−and the direct sum decomposition follows from the identity
v = ε+(v) + ε−(v).

2. G-HOMOMORPHISMS AND IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS
23
The decomposition in this example corresponds to the two distinct irreducible representa-
tions of Z/2. Later we will see (at least over the complex numbers C) that there is always such a
decomposition of a representation of a ﬁnite group G with factors corresponding to the distinct
irreducible representations of G.
Example 3.5. Let D2n be the dihedral group of order 2n described in Section 7.2. This
group is generated by elements α of order n and β of order 2, subject to the relation
βαβ = α−1.
We can realise D2n as the symmetry group of the regular n-gon centred at the origin and with
vertices on the unit circle (we take the ﬁrst vertex to be (1, 0)). It is easily checked that relative
the standard basis {e1, e2} of R2, we get
αr =
·cos 2rπ/n
−sin 2rπ/n
sin 2rπ/n
cos 2rπ/n
¸
βαr =
· cos 2rπ/n
−sin 2rπ/n
−sin 2rπ/n
−cos 2rπ/n
¸
for r = 0, . . . , (n −1).
Thus we have a 2-dimensional representation ρR of D2n over R, where the matrices of ρR(αr)
and ρR(βαr) are given by the above. We can also view R2 as a subset of C2 and interpret these
matrices as having coeﬃcients in C. Thus we obtain a 2-dimensional complex representation
ρC of D2n with the above matrices relative to the C-basis {e1, e2}.
2. G-homomorphisms and irreducible representations
Suppose that we have two representations ρ: G −→GL|(V ) and σ: G −→GL|(W). Then
a linear transformation f : V −→W is called G-equivariant, G-linear or a G-homomorphism
with respect to ρ and σ, if for each g ∈G the diagram
V
f
−−−−→W
ρg
y
yσg
V
f
−−−−→W
commutes, i.e., σg ◦f = f ◦ρg or equivalently, σg ◦f ◦ρg−1 = f. A G-homomorphism which is
a linear isomorphism is called a G-isomorphism or G-equivalence and we say that the represen-
tations are G-isomorphic or G-equivalent.
We deﬁne an action of G on Hom|(V, W), the vector space of k-linear transformations
V −→W, by
(g · f)(v) = σgf(ρg−1v)
(f ∈Hom|(V, W)).
This is another G-representation. The G-invariant subspace HomG(V, W) = Hom|(V, W)G is
then equal to the set of all G-homomorphisms.
If the only G-subspaces of V are {0} and V , ρ is called irreducible or simple.
Given a subrepresentation W ⊆V , the quotient vector space V/W also admits a linear
action of G, ρW : G −→GL|(V/W), the quotient representation, where
ρW (g)(v + W) = ρ(g)(v) + W,
which is well deﬁned since whenever v′ −v ∈W,
ρ(g)(v′) + W = ρ(g)(v + (v′ −v)) + W =
¡
ρ(g)(v) + ρ(g)(v′ −v))
¢
+ W = ρ(g)(v) + W.
Proposition 3.6. If f : V −→W is a G-homomorphism, then
a) ker f is a G-subspace of V ;
b) im f is a G-subspace of W.

24
3. REPRESENTATIONS OF FINITE GROUPS
Proof. (a) Let v ∈ker f. Then for g ∈G,
f(ρgv) = σgf(v) = 0,
so ρgv ∈ker f. Hence ker f is a G-subspace of V
(b) Let w ∈im f with w = f(u) for some u ∈V . Now
σgw = σgf(u) = f(ρgu) ∈im f,
hence im f is a G-subspace of W.
□
Theorem 3.7 (Schur’s Lemma). Let ρ: G −→GLC(V ) and σ: G −→GLC(W) be irred-
ucible representations of G over the ﬁeld C, and let f : V −→W be a G-linear map.
a) If f is not the zero map, then f is an isomorphism.
[Remark: Part (a) holds for any ﬁeld k.]
b) If V = W and ρ = σ, then f has the form
f(v) = λv
(v ∈V )
form some λ ∈C.
Proof. (a) Proposition 3.6 implies that ker f ⊆V and im f ⊆W are G-subspaces. By the
irreducibility of V , either ker f = V (in which case f is the zero map) or ker f = {0} in which
case f is injective. Similarly, irreducibility of W implies that im f = {0} (in which case f is the
zero map) or im f = W in which case f is surjective. Thus if f is not the zero map it must be
an isomorphism.
(b) Let λ ∈C be an eigenvalue of f, with eigenvector v0 ̸= 0. Let fλ : V −→V be the linear
transformation for which
fλ(v) = f(v) −λv
(v ∈V ).
For g ∈G,
ρgfλ(v) = ρgf(v) −ρgλv
= f(ρgv) −λρgv,
= fλ(ρgv),
showing that fλ is G-linear. Since fλ(v0) = 0, Proposition 3.6 shows that ker fλ = V . As
dimC V = dimC ker fλ + dimC im fλ,
we see that im fλ = {0} and so
fλ(v) = 0
(v ∈V ).
□
A linear transformation f : V −→V is sometimes called a homothety if it has the form
f(v) = λv
(v ∈V ).
In this proof, it is essential that we take k = C rather than k = R for example, since we
need the fact that every polynomial over C has a root to guarantee that linear transformations
V −→V always have eigenvalues. This theorem can fail to hold for representations over R as
the next example shows.
Example 3.8. Let k = R and V = C considered as a 2-dimensional R-vector space. Let
G = µ4 = {1, −1, i, −i}
be the group of all 4th roots of unity with ρ: µ4 −→GL|(V ) given by
ραz = αz.

2. G-HOMOMORPHISMS AND IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS
25
Then this deﬁnes a 2-dimensional representation of G over R. If we use the basis {u = 1, v = i},
then
ρiu = v,
ρiv = −u.
From this we see that any G-subspace of V containing a non-zero element w = au + bv also
contains −bu + av, and hence it must be all of V (exercise). So V is irreducible.
But the linear transformation ϕ: V −→V given by
ϕ(au + bv) = −bu + av = ρi(au + bv)
is G-linear, but not the same as multiplication by a real number (this is left as an exercise).
Theorem 3.9 (Maschke’s Theorem). Let V be a k-vector space and ρ: G −→GL|(V ) a
k-representation. Let W ⊆V be a G-subspace of V . Then there is a projection onto W which is
G-equivariant. Equivalently, there is a linear complement W ′ of W which is also a G-subspace.
Proof. Let p: V −→V be a projection onto W. Deﬁne a linear transformation p0 : V −→
V by
p0(v) =
1
|G|
X
g∈G
ρg ◦p ◦ρ−1
g (v).
Then for v ∈V ,
ρg ◦p ◦ρ−1
g (v) ∈W
since im p = W and W is a G-subspace; hence p0(v) ∈W. We also have
p0(ρgv) =
1

p0(w) =

ρgp(ρg−1w)

|G|

g∈G
ρgρg−1w

|G|(|G|w) = w.
Hence p0|W = IdW , showing that p0 has image W.
Now consider W ′ = ker p0, which is a G-subspace by part (a) of Proposition 3.6.
This
is a linear complement for W since given the quotient map q: V −→V/W, if v ∈W ′ then
q(v) = 0 + W implies v ∈W ∩W ′ and hence 0 = p0(v) = v.

3. REPRESENTATIONS OF FINITE GROUPS
Theorem 3.10. Let ρ: G −→GL|(V ) be a linear representation of a ﬁnite group with V
non-trivial. Then there are G-spaces U1, . . . , Ur ⊆V , each of which is a non-trivial irreducible
subrepresentation and
V = U1 ⊕· · · ⊕Ur.
Proof. We proceed by Induction on n = dim| V . If n = 1, the result is true with U1 = V .
So assume that the result holds whenever dim| V < n. Now either V is irreducible or there
is a proper G-subspace U1 ⊆V . By Theorem 3.9, there is a G-complement U′
1 of U1 in V with
dim| U′
1 < n. By the Inductive Hypothesis there are irreducible G-subspaces U2, . . . , Ur ⊆U′
1 ⊆
V for which
U′
1 = U2 ⊕· · · ⊕Ur,
and so we ﬁnd
V = U1 ⊕U2 ⊕· · · ⊕Ur.
□
We will see later that given any two such collections of non-trivial irreducible subrepresent-
ations U1, . . . , Ur and W1, . . . , Ws, we have s = r and for each k, the number of Wj G-isomorphic
to Uk is equal to the number of Uj G-isomorphic to Uk. The proof of this will use characters,
which give further information such as the multiplicity of each irreducible which occurs as a sum-
mand in V . The irreducible representations Uk are called the irreducible factors or summands
of the representation V .
An important example of a G-subspace of any representation ρ on V is the G-invariant
subspace
V G = {v ∈V : ρgv = v ∀g ∈G}.
We can construct a projection map V −→V G which is G-linear, provided that the characteristic
of k does not divide |G|. In practice, we will be mainly interested in the case where k = C, so
in this section from now on, we will assume that k has characteristic 0 .
Proposition 3.11. Let ε: V −→V be the k-linear transformation deﬁned by
ε(v) =
1
|G|
X
g∈G
ρgv.
The following hold.
a) For g ∈G and v ∈V , ρgε(v) = ε(v).
b) ε is G-linear.
c) For v ∈V G, ε(v) = v. Hence, im ε = V G.

3. New representations from old
Let G be a ﬁnite group and k a ﬁeld. In this section we will see how new representations
can be manufactured out of existing ones. As well as allowing interesting new examples to be
constructed, this sometimes gives ways of understanding representations in terms of familiar
ones. This will be important when we have learnt how to decompose representations in terms
of irreducibles and indeed is sometimes used to construct the latter.
Let V1, . . . , Vr be k-vector spaces carrying representations ρ1, . . . , ρr of G. Then for each
g ∈G and each j, we have the corresponding linear transformation ρjg : Vj −→Vj. Using
Proposition 1.18 we obtain a unique linear transformation
ρ1g ⊗· · · ⊗ρrg : V1 ⊗· · · ⊗Vr −→V1 ⊗· · · ⊗Vr.
It is easy to verify that this gives a representation of G on the tensor product V1⊗· · ·⊗Vr, called
the tensor product of the original representations. By Proposition 1.18 we have the formula
(3.1)
ρ1g ⊗· · · ⊗ρrg(v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vr) = ρ1gv1 ⊗· · · ⊗ρrgvr
for vj ∈Vj (j = 1, . . . , r).
Let V, W be k-vector spaces supporting representations ρ: G −→GL|(V ) and σ: G −→
GL|(W).
Recall that the set of all linear transformations V −→W is the k-vector space
Hom|(V, W) with addition and multiplication given by the formulæ
(ϕ + θ)(u) = ϕ(u) + θ(u),
(tϕ)(u) = t(ϕ(u)) = ϕ(tu)
for ϕ, θ ∈Hom|(V, W) and t ∈k.
We can also deﬁne an action of G on Hom|(V, W) by
(τgϕ)(u) = σgϕ(ρg−1u).
This turns out to be a linear representation of G on Hom|(V, W).
As a particular example of this, taking W = k with the trivial action of G (i.e., σg = Id|),
we obtain an action of G on the dual of V , V ∗= Hom|(V, k), the contragredient representation
ρ∗. Explicitly,
ρ∗
gϕ = ϕ ◦ρg−1.
Proposition 3.12. Let ρ: G −→GL|(V ) be a representation, and v = {v1, . . . , vn} a basis
of V . Suppose that relative to v,
[ρg]v = [rij(g)]
(g ∈G).
Then relative to the dual basis v∗= {v∗
1, . . . , v∗
n}, we have
[ρ∗
g]v∗= [rji(g−1)]
(g ∈G),
or equivalently,
[ρ∗
g]v∗= [ρg−1]T .
Proof. If we write
[ρ∗
g]v∗= [tij(g)],
then by deﬁnition,
ρ∗
gv∗
s =
n
X
r=1
trs(g)v∗
r.
Now for each i = 1, . . . , n,
(ρ∗

j )(vi) =
n
X
r=1
trj(g)v∗
r(vi),

3. REPRESENTATIONS OF FINITE GROUPS
which gives
v∗
j (ρg−1vi) = tij(g),
and hence
tij(g) = v∗
j (
n
X
k=1
rki(g−1)vi) = rji(g−1).
□
Another perspective on the above is provided by the next result, whose proof is left as an
exercise.
Proposition 3.13. The k-linear isomorphism
Hom|(V, W) ∼= W ⊗
| V ∗
is a G-isomorphism where the right hand side carries the tensor product representation σ ⊗ρ∗.
Using these ideas together with Proposition 3.11 we obtain the following useful result
Proposition 3.14. For k of characteristic 0, the G-homomorphism
ε: Hom|(V, W) −→Hom|(V, W)
of Proposition 3.11 has image equal to the set of G-homomorphisms V −→W, Hom|(V, W)G
which is also G-isomorphic to (W ⊗| V ∗)G.
Now let ρ: G −→GL|(V ) be a representation of G and let H ⩽G. We can restrict ρ to
H and obtain a representation ρ|H : H −→GL|(V ) of H, usually denoted ρ ↓G
H or ResG
H ρ; the
H-module V is also denoted V ↓G
H or ResG
H V .
Similarly, if G ⩽K, then we can form the induced representation ρ ↑K
G : K −→GL|(V ↑K
G)
as follows. Take KR to be the G-set consisting of the underlying set of K with the G-action
g · x = xg−1.
Deﬁne
V ↑K
G= IndK
G V = Map(KR, V )G = {f : K −→V : f(x) = ρgf(xg) ∀x ∈K}.
Then K acts linearly on V ↑K
G by
(k · f)(x) = f(kx),
and so we obtain a linear representation of K. The induced representation is often denoted
ρ ↑K
G or IndK
G ρ. The dimension of V ↑K
G is dim| V ↑K
G= |K/G| dim| V . Later we will meet
Reciprocity Laws relating these induction and restriction operations.
4. Permutation representations
Let G be a ﬁnite group and X a ﬁnite G-set, i.e., a ﬁnite set X equipped with an action
of G on X, written gx. A ﬁnite dimensional G-representation ρ: G −→GLC(V ) over k is a
permutation representation on X if there is an injective G-map j : X −→V and im j = j(X) ⊆V
is a k-basis for V . Notice that a permutation representation really depends on the injection
j. We frequently have situations where X ⊆V and j is the inclusion of the subset X. The
condition that j be a G-map amounts to the requirement that
ρg(j(x)) = j(gx)
(g ∈G, x ∈X).
Definition 3.15. A homomorphism from a permutation representation j1 : X1 −→V1 to a
second j2 : X2 −→V2 is a G-linear transformation Φ: V1 −→V2 such that
Φ(j1(x)) ∈im j2
(x ∈X1).
A G-homomorphism of permutation representations which is a G-isomorphism is called a G-
isomorphism of permutation representations.

4. PERMUTATION REPRESENTATIONS
29
Notice that by the injectivity of j2, this implies the existence of a unique G-map ϕ: X1 −→
X2 for which
j2(ϕ(x)) = Φ(j1(x))
(x ∈X1).
Equivalently, we could specify the G-map ϕ: X1 −→X2 and then Φ: V1 −→V2 would be the
unique linear extension of ϕ restricted to im j2 (see Proposition 1.1). In the case where Φ is a
G-isomorphism, it is easily veriﬁed that ϕ: X1 −→X2 is a G-equivalence.
To show that such permutations representations exist in abundance, we proceed as follows.
Let X be a ﬁnite set equipped with a G-action. Let k[X] = Map(X, k), the set of all functions
X −→k. This is a ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space with addition and scalar multiplication
deﬁned by
(f1 + f2)(x) = f1(x) + f2(x),
(tf)(x) = t(f(x)),
for f1, f2, f ∈Map(X, k), t ∈k and x ∈X. There is an action of G on Map(X, k) given by
(g · f)(x) = f(g−1x).
If Y is a second ﬁnite G-set, and ϕ: X −→Y a G-map, then we deﬁne the induced function
ϕ∗: k[X] −→k[Y ] by
(ϕ∗f)(y) =
X
x∈ϕ−1{y}
f(x) =
X
ϕ(x)=y
f(x).
Theorem 3.16. Let G be a ﬁnite group.
a) For a ﬁnite G-set X, k[X] is a ﬁnite dimensional permutation representation of di-
mension dim| k[X] = |X|.
b) For a G-map ϕ: X −→Y , the induced function ϕ∗: k[X] −→k[Y ] is a G-linear
transformation.
Proof.
a) For each x ∈X we have a function δx : X −→k given by
δx(y) =
(
1
if y = x,
0
otherwise.
The map j : X −→k[X] given by
j(x) = δx
is easily seen to be an injection. It is also a G-map, since
δgx(y) = 1
⇐⇒
δx(g−1y) = 1,
and hence
j(gx)(y) = δgx(y) = δx(g−1y) = (g · δx)(y).
Given a function f : X −→k, consider
f −
X
x∈X
f(x)δx ∈k[X].
Then for y ∈X,
f(y) −
X
x∈X
f(x)δx(y) = f(y) −f(y) = 0,
hence f −P
x∈X f(x)δx is the constant function taking the value 0 on X. So the functions δx
(x ∈X) span k[X]. They are also linearly independent, since if the 0 valued constant function
is expressed in the form
X
x∈X
txδx

30
3. REPRESENTATIONS OF FINITE GROUPS
for some tx ∈k, then for each y ∈X,
0 =
X
x∈X
txδx(y) = ty,
hence all the coeﬃcients tx must be 0.
b) The k-linearity of ϕ∗is easily checked. To show it is a G-map, for g ∈G,
(g · ϕ∗f)(y) = (ϕ∗f)(g−1y)
=
X
x∈ϕ−1{g−1y}
f(x)
=
X
x∈ϕ−1{y}
f(g−1x),
since we have
ϕ−1{g−1y} = {x ∈X : gϕ(x) = y} = {x ∈X : ϕ(gx) = y} = {g−1x : x ∈X, x ∈ϕ−1{y}}.
Since by deﬁnition
(g · f)(x) = f(g−1x),
we have
(g · ϕ∗f) = ϕ∗(g · f).
□
Given a permutation representation k[X], we will often identify X with a subset of k[X],
using the injection j. If ϕ: X −→Y is a G-map, notice that
ϕ∗(
X
x∈X
txδx) =
X
x∈X
txδϕ(x).
We will sometimes write x instead of δx, and a typical element of k[X] as P
x∈X txx rather
than P
x∈X txδx, where tx ∈k. Another useful notational device is to list the elements of X
as x1, x2, . . . , xn and then identify n = {1, 2, . . . , n} with X via the correspondence k ←→xk.
Then we can identify k[n] ∼= kn with k[X] using the correspondence
(t1, t2, . . . , tn) ←→
n
X
k=1
tkxk.
5. Properties of permutation representations
Let X be a ﬁnite G-set. The result shows how to reduce an arbitrary permutation repre-
sentation to a direct sum of those induced from transitive G-sets.
Proposition 3.17. Let X = X1
` X2 where X1, X2 ⊆X are closed under the action of G.
Then there is a G-isomorphism
k[X] ∼= k[X1] ⊕k[X2].
Proof. Let j1 : X1 −→X and j2 : X2 −→X be the inclusion maps, which are G-maps. By
Theorem 3.16(b), there are G-linear transformations j1∗: k[X1] −→k[X] and j2∗: k[X2] −→
k[X]. For
f =
X
x∈X
txx ∈k[X],
we have the ‘restrictions’
f1 =
X
x∈X1
txx,
f2 =
X
x∈X2
txx.
We deﬁne our linear map k[X] ∼= k[X1] ⊕k[X2] by
f 7−→(f1, f2).

5. PROPERTIES OF PERMUTATION REPRESENTATIONS
31
It is easily seen that this is a linear transformation, and moreover has an inverse given by
(h1, h2) 7−→j1∗h1 + j2∗h2.
Finally, this is a G-map since the latter is the sum of two G-maps, hence its inverse is.
□
Let X1 and X2 be G-sets; then X = X1 ×X2 can be made into a G-set with action given by
g · (x1, x2) = (gx1, gx2).
Proposition 3.18. Let X1 and X2 be G-sets. Then there is a G-isomorphism
k[X1] ⊗k[X2] ∼= k[X1 × X2].
Proof. The function F : k[X1] × k[X2] −→k[X1 × X2] deﬁned by
F(
X
x∈X1
sxx,
X
y∈X2
tyy) =
X
x∈X1
X
y∈X2
sxty(x, y)
is k-bilinear. Hence by the universal property of the tensor product (Section 4, UP-TP), there
is a unique linear transformation F ′ : k[X1] ⊗k[X2] −→k[X1 × X2] for which
F ′(x ⊗y) = (x, y)
(x ∈X1, y ∈X2).
This is easily seen to to be an isomorphism and also G-linear.
□
Definition 3.19. Let G be a ﬁnite group. The regular representation over k is the G-
representation k[G], of dimension dim| k[G] = |G|.
Proposition 3.20. The regular representation of a ﬁnite group G over a ﬁeld k is a ring
(in fact a k-algebra). Moreover, this ring is commutative if and only if G is abelian.
Proof. Let a = P
g∈G agg and b = P
g∈G bgg where ag, bg ∈G. Then we deﬁne the product
of a and b by
ab =
X
g∈G
ÃX
h∈G
ahbh−1g
!
g.
Note that for g, h ∈G in k[G] we have
(1g)(1h) = gh.
For commutativity, each such product (1g)(1h) must agree with (1h)(1g), which happens if and
only if G is abelian. The rest of the details are left as an exercise.
□
The ring k[G] is called the group algebra or group ring of G over k. The next result is
left as an exercise for those who know about modules. It provides a link between the study
of modules over k[G] and G-representations, and so the group ring construction provides an
important source of non-commutative rings and their modules.
Proposition 3.21. Let V be a k vector space. Then if V carries a G-representation, it
admits the structure of a k[G] module deﬁned by
(
X
g∈G
agg)v =
X
g∈G
aggv.
Conversely, if V is a k[G]-module, then it admits a G-representation with action deﬁned by
g · v = (1g)v.

6. Calculating in permutation representations
In this section, we determine how the permutation representation k[X] looks in terms of the
basis consisting of elements x (x ∈X). We know that g ∈G acts by sending x to gx. Hence, if
we label the rows and columns of a matrix by the elements of X, the |X| × |X| matrix [g] of g
with respect to this basis has xy entry
(6.1)
[g]xy = δx,gy =
(
1
if x = gy,
0
else,
where δa,b denotes the Kronecker δ function which is 0 except for when a = b and it then takes
the value 1. Thus there is exactly one 1 in each row and column, and 0’s everywhere else. The
following is an important example.
Let X = n = {1, 2, . . . , n} and G = Sn, the symmetric group of degree n, acting on n in the
usual way. We may take as a basis for k[n], the functions δj (1 ⩽j ⩽n) given by
δj(k) =
(
1
if k = j,
0
else.
Relative to this basis, the action of σ ∈Sn is given by the n × n matrix [σ] whose ij th entry is
(6.2)
[σ]ij =

if i = σ(j),
0

An important fact about permutation representations is the following, which makes their char-
acters easy to calculate.
Proposition 3.22. Let X be a ﬁnite G-set, and k[X] the associated permutation represen-
tation. Let g ∈G and ρg : k[X] −→k[X] be the linear transformation induced by g. Then
Tr ρg = |Xg| = |{x ∈X : gx = x}| = number of elements of X ﬁxed by g.
Proof. Take the elements of X as a basis for k[X]. Then Tr ρg is the sum of the diagonal
terms in the matrix [ρg] relative to this basis. Hence
Tr ρg = number of non-zero diagonal terms in [ρg]
= number of elements of X ﬁxed by g
by Equation (6.1).
□
Our next result which that permutation representations are self-dual.
Proposition 3.23. Let X be a ﬁnite G-set, and k[X] the associated permutation represen-
tation. Then there is a G-isomorphism k[X] ∼= k[X]∗.

7. GENERALIZED PERMUTATION REPRESENTATIONS
33
Proof. Take as a basis of k[X] the elements x ∈X. Then a basis for the dual space k[X]∗
consists of the elements x∗. By deﬁnition of the action of G on k[X]∗= Hom|(k[X], k), we have
(g · x∗)(y) = x∗(g−1x)
(g ∈G, y ∈X).
A familiar calculation shows that g · x∗= (gx)∗, and so this basis is also permuted by G. Now
deﬁne a function ϕ: k[X] −→k[X]∗by
ϕ(
X
x∈X
axx) =
X
x∈X
axx∗.
This is a k-linear isomorphism also satisfying

Hence ϕ is a G-isomorphism.
□
7. Generalized permutation representations
It is useful to generalize the notion of permutation representation somewhat. Let V be a
ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space with a representation of G, ρ: G −→GL|(V ); we will usually
write gv = ρgv. We can consider the set of all functions X −→V , Map(X, V ), and this is also
a ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space with addition and scalar multiplication deﬁned by
(f1 + f2)(x) = f1(x) + f2(x),
(tf)(x) = t(f(x)),
for f1, f2, f ∈Map(X, V ), t ∈k and x ∈X. There is a representation of G on Map(X, V ) given
by
(g · f)(x) = gf(g−1x).
We call this a generalized permutation representation of G.
Proposition 3.24. Let Map(X, V ) be a permutation representation of G, where V has basis
v = {v1, . . . , vn}. Then the functions δx,j : X −→V (x ∈X, 1 ⩽j ⩽n) given by
δx,j(y) =
(
vj
if y = x,
0
otherwise,
for y ∈X, form a basis for Map(X, V ). Hence,
dim| Map(X, V ) = |X| dim| V.
Proof. Let f : X −→V . Then for any y ∈X,
f(y) =
n
X
j=1
fj(y)vj,
where fj : X −→k is a function. It suﬃces now to show that any function h: X −→k has a
unique expression as
h =
X
x∈X
hxδx
where hx ∈k and δx : X −→k is given by
δx(y) =
(
1
if y = x,
0
otherwise.
But for y ∈X,
h(y) =
X
x∈X
hxδx(y)
⇐⇒
h(y) = hy.

34
3. REPRESENTATIONS OF FINITE GROUPS
Hence h = P
x∈X h(x)δx is the unique expansion of this form. Combining this with the above
we have
f(y) =
n
X
j=1
fj(y)vj =
n
X
j=1
X
x∈X
fj(x)δx(y)vj,
and so
f =
n
X
j=1
X
x∈X
fj(x)δxj,
is the unique such expression, since δxj(y) = δx(y)vj.
□
Proposition 3.25. If V = V1 ⊕V2 is a direct sum of representations V1, V2, then there is a
G-isomorphism
Map(X, V ) ∼= Map(X, V1) ⊕Map(X, V2).
Proof. Recall that every v ∈V has a unique expression of the form
v = v1 + v2.
Deﬁne a function Map(X, V ) −→Map(X, V1) ⊕Map(X, V2) by
f −→f1 + f2
where f1 : X −→V1 and f2 : X −→V2 satisfy
f(x) = f1(x) + f2(x)
(x ∈X).
This is easily seen to be both a linear isomorphism and a G-homomorphism, hence a G-
isomorphism.
□
Proposition 3.26. Let X = X1
` X2 where X1, X2 ⊆X are closed under the action of G.
Then there is a G-isomorphism
Map(X, V ) ∼= Map(X1, V ) ⊕Map(X2, V ).
Proof. Let j1 : X1 −→X and j2 : X2 −→X be the inclusion maps, which are G-maps.
Then given f : X −→V , we have two functions fk : X −→V (k = 1, 2) given by
fk(x) =
(
f(x)
if x ∈Xk,
0
else.
Deﬁne a function Map(X, V ) ∼= Map(X1, V ) −→Map(X2, V ) by
f −→f1 + f2.
This is easily seen to be a linear isomorphism. We have
(g · f)k = g · fk,
using the fact that Xk is closed under the action of G, hence
g · (f1 + f2) = g · f1 + g · f2.
Thus this map is a G-isomorphism.
□
These results tell us how to reduce an arbitrary generalized permutation representation to
a direct sum of those induced from a transitive G-set X and an irreducible representation V .

CHAPTER 4
Character theory
1. Characters and class functions on a ﬁnite group
Let G be a ﬁnite group and ρ: G −→GLC(V ) a ﬁnite dimensional C-representation of
dimension dimC V = n. For g ∈G, the linear transformation ρg : V −→V will sometimes be
written g· or g. The character of g in the representation ρ is the trace of g on V , i.e.,
χρ(g) = Tr ρg = Tr g.
We can view χρ as a function χρ : G −→C, the character of the representation ρ.
Definition 4.1. A function θ: G −→C is a class function if for all g, h ∈G,
θ(hgh−1) = θ(g),
i.e., θ is constant on each conjugacy class of G.
Proposition 4.2. For all g, h ∈G,
χρ(hgh−1) = χρ(g).
Hence χρ : G −→C is a class function on G.
Proof. We have
ρhgh−1 = ρh ◦ρg ◦ρh−1 = ρh ◦ρg ◦ρ−1
h
and so
χρ(hgh−1) = Tr ρh ◦ρg ◦ρ−1
h
= Tr ρg = χρ(g).
□
Example 4.3. Let G = S3 act on the set 3 = {1, 2, 3} in the usual way. Let V = C[3] be
the associated permutation representation over C, where we take as a basis e = {e1, e2, e3} with
action
σ · ej = eσ(j).
Let us determine the character of this representation ρ: S3 −→GLC(V ).
The elements of S3 written using cycle notation are the following:
1, (12), (23), (13), (123), (132).
The matrices of these elements with respect to e are

Taking traces we obtain
χρ(1) = 3, χρ(12) = χρ(23) = χρ(13) = 1, χρ(123) = χρ(132) = 0.
Notice that we have χρ(g) ∈Z. Indeed, by Proposition 3.22 we have
Proposition 4.4. Let X be a G-set and ρ the associated permutation representation on
C[X]. Then
χρ(g) = |Xg| = |{x ∈X : g · x = x}| = the number of elements of X ﬁxed by g.

4. CHARACTER THEORY
The next result sheds further light on the signiﬁcance of the character of a G-representation
over the complex number ﬁeld C. This makes use of the linear algebra developed in Section 3
of Chapter 1.
Theorem 4.5. For g ∈G, there is a basis v = {v1, . . . , vn} of V consisting of eigenvectors
of the linear transformation g.
Proof. Let d = |g|, the order of g. For v ∈V ,
(gd −IdV )(v) = 0.
Now we can apply Lemma 1.14 with the polynomial f(X) = Xd −1, which has d distinct roots
in C.
□
There may well be a smaller degree polynomial identity satisﬁed by the linear transformation
g on V . However, if a polynomial f(X) satisﬁed by g has deg f(X) ⩽d and no repeated linear
factors, then f(X)|(Xd −1).
Corollary 4.6. The distinct eigenvalues of the linear transformation g on V are dth roots
of unity. More precisely, if d0 is the smallest natural number such that for all v ∈V ,
(gd0 −IdV )(v) = 0,
then the distinct eigenvalues of g are d0th roots of unity.
Proof. An eigenvalue λ (with eigenvector vλ ̸= 0) of g satisﬁes
(gd −IdV )(vλ) = 0,
hence
(λd −1)vλ = 0.
□
Corollary 4.7. For any g ∈G we have
χρ(g) =
n
X
j=1
λj
where λ1, . . . , λn are the n eigenvalues of ρg on V , including repetitions.
Corollary 4.8. For g ∈G we have
χρ(g−1) = χρ(g) = χρ∗(g).
Proof. If the eigenvalues of ρg including repetitions are λ1, . . . , λn, then the eigenvalues of
ρg−1 including repetitions are easily seen to be λ−1
1 , . . . , λ−1
n . But if ζ is a root of unity, then
ζ−1 = ζ, and so χρ(g−1) = χρ(g). The second equality follows from Proposition 3.12.
□
Now let us return to the idea of functions on a group which are invariant under conjugation.
Denote by Gc the set G and let G act on it by conjugation,
g · x = gxg−1.
The set of all functions Gc −→C, Map(Gc, C) has an action of G given by
(g · α)(x) = α(gxg−1)
for α ∈Map(Gc, C), g ∈G and x ∈Gc. Then the class functions are those which are invari-
ant under conjugation and hence form the set Map(Gc, C)G which is a C-vector subspace of
Map(Gc, C).

2. PROPERTIES OF CHARACTERS
37
Proposition 4.9. The C-vector space Map(Gc, C)G has as a basis the set of functions
∆C : Gc −→C for C a conjugacy class in G, determined by
∆C(x) =
(
1
if x ∈C,
0
if x /∈C.
Thus dimC Map(Gc, C)G is the number of conjugacy classes in G.
Proof. By the proof of Theorem 3.16, a class function α: Gc −→C function can be
uniquely expressed in the form
α =
X
x∈Gc
axδx
for suitable ax ∈Gc. But
g · α =
X
x∈Gc
ax(g · δx) =
X
x∈Gc
axδgxg−1 =
X
x∈Gc
agxg−1δx.
Hence by uniqueness and the deﬁnition of class function, we must have
agxg−1 = ax
(g ∈G, x ∈Gc).
Hence,
α =
X
C
aC
X
x∈C
δx,
where for each conjugacy class C we choose any element c0 ∈C and put aC = ac0. Here the
outer sum is over all the conjugacy classes C of G. We now ﬁnd that
∆C =
X
x∈C
δx
and the rest of the proof is straightforward.
□
We will see that the characters of non-isomorphic irreducible representations of G also form
a basis of Map(Gc, C)G. We will set C(G) = Map(Gc, C)G.
2. Properties of characters
In this section we will see some other important properties of characters.
Theorem 4.10. Let G be a ﬁnite group with ﬁnite dimensional complex representations
ρ: G −→GLC(V ) and σ: G −→GLC(W). Then
a) χρ(e) = dimC V and for g ∈G, |χρ(g)| ⩽χρ(e).
b) The tensor product representation ρ ⊗σ has character
χρ⊗σ = χρχσ,
i.e., for g ∈G,
χρ⊗σ(g) = χρ(g)χσ(g).
c) Let τ : G −→GLC(U) be a representation which is G-isomorphic to the direct sum of
ρ and σ, so U ∼= V ⊕W. Then
χτ = χρ + χσ,
i.e., for g ∈G,
χτ(g) = χρ(g) + χσ(g).
Proof.

38
4. CHARACTER THEORY
a) The ﬁrst statement is immediate from the deﬁnition.
For the second, using Theo-
rem 4.5, we may choose a basis v = {v1, . . . , vr} of V for which ρgvk = λkvk, where λk
is a root of unity (hence satisﬁes |λk| = 1). Then
|χρ(g)| = |
r
X
k=1
λk| ⩽
r
X
k=1
|λk| = r = χρ(e).
b) Let g ∈G. By Theorem 4.5 we can ﬁnd bases v = {v1, . . . , vr} and w = {w1, . . . , ws}
for V and W consisting of eigenvectors for ρg and σg with corresponding eigenvalues
λ1, . . . , λr and µ1, . . . , µs. The elements vi ⊗wj form a basis for V ⊗W and by the
formula of Equation (3.1), the action of g on these vectors is given by
(ρ ⊗σ)g · (vi ⊗wj) = λiµjvi ⊗wj.
Finally Corollary 4.7 implies
Tr(ρ ⊗σ)g =
X
i,j
λiµj = χρ(g)χσ(g).
c) For g ∈G, choose bases v = {v1, . . . , vr} and w = {w1, . . . , ws} for V and W consisting
of eigenvectors for ρg and σg with corresponding eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λr and µ1, . . . , µs.
Then v ∪w = {v1, . . . , vr, w1, . . . , ws} is a basis for U consisting of eigenvectors for τg
with the above eigenvalues. Then
χτ(g) = Tr τg = λ1 + · · · + λr + µ1 + · · · + µs = χρ(g) + χσ(g).
□
3. Inner products of characters
In this section we will discuss a way to ‘compare’ characters, using a scalar or inner product
on the vector space of class functions C(G). In particular, we will see that the character of
a representation determines it up to a G-isomorphism. We will again work over the ﬁeld of
complex numbers C.
We begin with the notion of scalar or inner product on a ﬁnite dimensional C-vector space
V . A function ( | ): V × V −→C is called a hermitian inner or scalar product on V if for
v, v1, v2, w ∈V and z1, z2 ∈C,
(z1v1 + z2v2|w) = z1(v1|w) + z2(v2|w),
(LLin)
(w|z1v1 + z2v2) = z1(w|v1) + z2(w|v2),
(RLin)
(v|w) = (w|v),
(Symm)
0 ⩽(v|v) ∈R with equality if and only if v = 0.
(PoDe)
A set of vectors {v1, . . . , vk} is said to be orthonormal if
(vi|vj) = δij =
(
1
if i = j,
0
else.
We will deﬁne an inner product ( | )G on C(G) = Map(Gc, C)G, often writing ( | ) when the
group G is clear from the context.
Definition 4.11. For α, β ∈C(G), let
(α|β)G =
1
|G|
X
g∈G
α(g)β(g).
Proposition 4.12. ( | ) = ( | )G is an hermitian inner product on C(G).

3. INNER PRODUCTS OF CHARACTERS
39
Proof. The properties LLin, RLin and Symm are easily checked. We will show that PoDe
holds. We have
(α|α) =
1
|G|
X
g∈G
α(g)α(g) =
1
|G|
X
g∈G
|α(g)|2 ⩾0
with equality if and only if α(g) = 0 for all g ∈G. Hence (α|α) satisﬁes PoDe.
□
Now let ρ: G −→GLC(V ) and θ: G −→GLC(W) be ﬁnite dimensional representations
over C. We know how to determine (χρ|χθ)G from the deﬁnition. Here is another interpreta-
tion of this quantity. Recall from Proposition 3.13 the representations of G on W ⊗V ∗and
HomC(V, W); in fact these are G-isomorphic, W ⊗V ∗∼= HomC(V, W). By Proposition 3.14, the
G-invariant subspaces (W ⊗V ∗)G and HomC(V, W)G are subrepresentations and are images of
G-homomorphisms ε1 : W ⊗V ∗−→W ⊗V ∗and ε2 : HomC(V, W) −→HomC(V, W).
Proposition 4.13. We have
(χθ|χρ)G = Tr ε1 = Tr ε2.
Proof. Let g ∈G. By Theorem 4.5 and Corollary 4.7 we can ﬁnd bases v = {v1, . . . , vr}
for V and w = {w1, . . . , ws} for W consisting of eigenvectors with corresponding eigenvalues
λ1, . . . , λr and µ1, . . . , µs. The elements wj ⊗v∗
i form a basis for W ⊗V ∗and moreover g acts
on these by
(θ ⊗ρ∗)g(wj ⊗v∗
i ) = µjλiwj ⊗v∗
i ,
using Proposition 3.12. By Corollary 4.7 we have
Tr(θ ⊗ρ∗)g =
X
i,j
µjλi = (
X
j
µj)(
X
i
λi) = χθ(g)χρ(g).
By deﬁnition of ε1, we have
Tr ε1 =
1
|G|
X
g∈G
Tr(θ ⊗ρ∗)g =
1
|G|
X
g∈G
χθ(g)χρ(g) = (χθ|χρ).
Since ε2 corresponds to ε1 under the G-isomorphism W ⊗V ∗∼= HomC(V, W) we obtain
Tr ε1 = Tr ε2.
□
Corollary 4.14. For irreducible representations ρ and θ,
(χθ|χρ) =
(
1
if ρ and θ are G-equivalent,
0
otherwise.
Proof. By Schur’s Lemma, Theorem 3.7,
dim| Hom|(V, W)G =
(
1
if ρ and θ are G-equivalent,
0
otherwise.
Since ε2 is the identity on Hom|(V, W)G, we obtain the result.
□
Thus if we take a collection of non-equivalent irreducible representations {ρ1, . . . , ρr}, their
characters form an orthonormal set {χρ1, . . . , χρr} in C(G), i.e.,
(χρi|χρj) = δij.
By Proposition 4.9 we know that dimC C(G) is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in G.
We will show that the characters of the distinct inequivalent irreducible representations form a
basis for C(G), thus there must be dimC C(G) such distinct inequivalent irreducibles.
Theorem 4.15. The characters of all the distinct inequivalent irreducible representations of
G form an orthonormal basis for C(G).

40
4. CHARACTER THEORY
Proof. Suppose α ∈C(G) and for every irreducible ρ we have (α|χρ) = 0. We will show
that α = 0.
Suppose that ρ: G −→GLC(V ) is any representation of G. Then deﬁne ρα : V −→V by
ρα(v) =
X
g∈G
α(g)ρgv.
For any h ∈G and v ∈V we have
ρα(ρhv) =
X
g∈G
α(g)ρg(ρhv)
= ρh

X
g∈G
α(g)ρh−1ghv


= ρh

X
g∈G
α(h−1gh)ρh−1ghv


= ρh

X
g∈G
α(g)ρgv


= ρhρα(v).
Hence ρα ∈HomC(V, V )G, i.e., ρα is G-linear.
Now if we apply this to an irreducible ρ of dimension n say, by Schur’s Lemma, Theorem 3.7,
there must be a λ ∈C for which ρα = λ IdV .
Taking traces, we have Tr ρα = nλ. Also
Tr ρα =
X
g∈G
α(g) Tr ρg =
X
g∈G
α(g)χρ(g) = |G|(α|χρ∗).
Hence we obtain
λ =
|G|
dimC V (α|χρ∗).
If (α|χρ) = 0 for all irreducible ρ, then as ρ∗is irreducible whenever ρ is, we must have ρα = 0
for every such irreducible ρ.
Since every representation ρ decomposes into a sum of irreducible subrepresentations, it is
easily veriﬁed that for every ρ we also have ρα = 0 for such an α.
Now apply this to the regular representation ρ = ρreg on V = C[G]. Taking the basis vector
e ∈C[G] we have
ρα(e) =
X
g∈G
α(g)ρge =
X
g∈G
α(g)ge =
X
g∈G
α(g)g.
But this must be 0, hence we have
X
g∈G
α(g)g = 0
in C[G] which can only happen if α(g) = 0 for every g ∈G, since the g ∈G form a basis of
C[G]. Thus α = 0 as desired.
Now for any α ∈C(G), we can form the function
α′ = α −
r
X
i=1
(α|χρi)χρi,

4. CHARACTER TABLES
41
where ρ1, ρ2, . . . , ρr is a complete set of non-isomorphic irreducible representation of G. For
each k we have
(α′|χρk) = (α|χρk) −
r
X
i=1
(α|χρi)(χρi|χρk)
= (α|χρk) −
r
X
i=1
(α|χρi)δi k
= (α|χρk) −(α|χρk) = 0,
hence α′ = 0. So the characters χρi span C(G), and orthogonality shows that they are linearly
independent, hence they form a basis.
□
Recall Theorem 3.10 which says that any representation V can be decomposed into irred-
ucible G-subspaces,
V = V1 ⊕· · · ⊕Vm.
Theorem 4.16. Let V = V1 ⊕· · · ⊕Vm be a decomposition into irreducible subspaces. If
ρk : G −→GLC(Vk) is the representation on Vk and ρ: G −→GLC(V ) is the representation on
V , then (χρ|χρk) = (χρk|χρ) is equal to the number of the factors Vj G-equivalent to Vk.
More generally, if also W = W1⊕· · ·⊕Wn is a decomposition into irreducible subspaces with
σk : G −→GLC(Wk) the representation on Wk and σ: G −→GLC(W) is the representation on
W, then
(χσ|χρk) = (χρk|χσ)

4. Character tables
The character table of a ﬁnite group G is the array formed as follows. Its columns correspond
to the conjugacy classes of G while its rows correspond to the characters χi of the inequiva-
lent irreducible representations of G. The jth conjugacy class Cj is indicated by displaying a
representative cj ∈Cj. In the (i, j)th entry we put χi(cj).

χ2(c2)
· · ·
χ2(cn)
...
...
χn
χn(c1)
χn(c2)
· · ·
χn(cn)
Conventionally we take c1 = e and χ1 to be the trivial character corresponding to the trivial
1-dimensional representation. Since χ1(g) = 1 for g ∈G, the top of the table will always have
the form
e
c2
· · ·
cn
χ1

Also, the ﬁrst column will consist of the dimensions of the irreducibles ρi, χi(e).

The representations corresponding to the χj will be discussed later. Once we have the character
table of a group G we can decompose an arbitrary representation into its irreducible constituents,
since if the distinct irreducibles have characters χj (1 ⩽j ⩽r) then a representation ρ on V
has a decomposition
V ∼= n1V1 ⊕· · · ⊕nrVr,
where njVj ∼= Vj ⊕· · · ⊕Vj means a G-subspace isomorphic to the sum of nj copies of the
irreducible representation corresponding to χj. Theorem 4.16 now gives nj = (χρ|χj). The
non-negative integer nj is called the multiplicity of the irreducible Vj in V .
The following
irreducibility criterion is very useful.
Proposition 4.17. If ρ: G −→GLC(V ) is a non-zero representation, then V is irreducible
if and only if (χρ|χρ) = 1.
Proof. If V = n1V1 ⊕· · · ⊕nrVr, then by orthonormality of the χj,
(χρ|χρ) = (
X
i
niχi|
X
j
njχj) =
X
i
X
j
ninj(χi|χj) =
X
j
n2
j.
So (χρ|χρ) = 1 if and only if n2
1 + · · · + n2
r = 1. Remembering that the nj are non-negative
integers we see that (χρ|χρ) = 1 if and only if all but one of the nj is zero and for some k,
nk = 1. Thus V ∼= Vk and so is irreducible.
□
Notice that for the character table of S3 we can check that the characters satisfy this criterion
and are also orthonormal. Provided we believe that the rows really do represent characters we
have found an orthonormal basis for the class functions C(S3). We will return to this problem
later.
Example 4.18. Let us assume that the above character table for S3 is correct and let
ρ = ρreg be the regular representation of S3 on the vector space V = C[S3]. Let us take as a
basis for V the elements of S3. Then
ρστ = στ,
hence the matrix [ρσ] of ρσ relative to this basis has 0’s down its main diagonal, except when
σ = e for which it is the 6 × 6 identity matrix. The character is χ given by
χ(σ) = Tr[ρσ] =
(
6
if σ = e,
0
otherwise.
Thus we obtain
(χρ|χ1) = 1
6
X
σ∈S3
χρ(σ)χ1(σ) = 1
66 = 1,
(χρ|χ2) = 1
6
X
σ∈S3
χρ(σ)χ2(σ) = 1
66 = 1,
(χρ|χ3) = 1
6
X
σ∈S3
χρ(σ)χ3(σ) = 1
6(6 × 2) = 2.
Hence we have
C[S3] ∼= V1 ⊕V2 ⊕V3 ⊕V3 = V1 ⊕V2 ⊕2V3.

4. CHARACTER TABLES
43
In fact we have seen the representation V3 already in Problem Sheet 2, Qu. 5(b). It is easily
veriﬁed that the character of that representation is χ3.
Of course, in order to use character tables, we ﬁrst need to determine them! So far we do
not know much about this beyond the fact that the number of rows has to be the same as
the number of conjugacy classes of the group G and the existence of the 1-dimensional trivial
character which we will always denote by χ1 and whose value is χ1(g) = 1 for g ∈G. The
characters of the distinct complex irreducible representations of G are the irreducible characters
of G.
Theorem 4.19. Let G be a ﬁnite group. Let χ1, . . . , χr be the distinct complex irreducible
characters and ρreg the regular representation of G on C[G].
a) Every complex irreducible representation of G occurs in C[G]. Equivalently, for each
irreducible character χj, (χρreg|χj) ̸= 0.
b) The multiplicity nj of the irreducible Vj with character χj in C[G] is given by
nj = dimC Vj = χj(e).
So to ﬁnd all the irreducible characters, we only have to decompose the regular representa-
tion!
Proof. Using the formualæ
χρreg(g) =
(
|G|
if g = e,
0
if g ̸= e,
we have
nj = (χρreg|χj) =

χρreg(g)χj(g) =

The following result also holds but the proof requires some Algebraic Number Theory.
Proposition 4.21. For each irreducible character χj, nj = (χρreg|χj) divides the order of
G, i.e., nj | |G|.
The following row and column orthogonality results for the character table of a group G are
very important.
Theorem 4.22. Let χ1, . . . , χr be the distinct complex irreducible characters of G and e =
g1, . . . , gr be a collection of representatives for the conjugacy classes of G and for each k, let
CG(gk) be the centralizer of gk.
a) Row orthogonality: For 1 ⩽i, j ⩽r,
r

b) Column orthogonality: For 1 ⩽i, j ⩽r,

b) Let ψs : G −→C be the function given by
ψs(g) =

0
if g is not conjugate to gs.
By Theorem 4.15, there are λk ∈C such that
ψs =

But then λj = (ψs|χj). We also have
(ψs|χj) =

5. Examples of character tables
Equipped with the results of the last section, we can proceed to ﬁnd some character tables.
For abelian groups we have the following result which follows from what we have seen already
together with the fact that in an abelian group every conjugacy class has exactly one element.
Proposition 4.23. Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group. Then there are |G| distinct complex
irreducible characters, each of which is 1-dimensional. Moreover, in the regular representation
each irreducible occurs with multiplicity 1, i.e.,
C[G] ∼= V1 ⊕· · · ⊕V|G|.

5. EXAMPLES OF CHARACTER TABLES

Example 4.24. Let G = ⟨g0⟩∼= Z/n be cyclic of order n. Let ζn = e2πi/n, the ‘standard’
primitive nth root of unity. Then for each k = 0, 1, . . . , (n −1) we may deﬁne a 1-dimensional
representation ρk : G −→C× by
ρk(gr
0) = ζrk
n .
The character of ρk is χk given by
χk(gr
0) = ζrk
n .
Clearly these are all irreducible and non-isomorphic.
Let us consider the orthogonality relations for these characters. We have

By row orthogonality this sum is 0. This is a special case of the following identity which is often

Proof. There are 5 conjugacy classes:
{1}, {−1}, {i, −i}, {j, −j}, {k, −k}.
As always we have the trivial character χ1. There are 3 homomorphisms Q8 −→C× given by
ρi(ir) = 1
and
ρi(j) = ρi(k) = −1,
ρj(jr) = 1
and
ρj(i) = ρi(k) = −1,
ρk(kr) = 1
and
ρk(i) = ρk(j) = −1.
These provide three 1-dimensional representations with characters χi, χj, χk taking values
χi(ir) = 1
and
χi(j) = χi(k) = −1,
χj(jr) = 1
and
χj(i) = χi(k) = −1,
χk(kr) = 1
and
χk(i) = χk(j) = −1.
Since |Q8| = 8, we might try looking for a 2-dimensional complex representation. But the deﬁni-
tion of Q8 provides us with the inclusion homomorphism j : Q8 −→GLC(C2), where we interpret
the matrices as taken in terms of the standard basis. The character of this representation is χ2
given by
χ2(1) = 2, χ2(−1) = −2, χ2(±i) = χ2(±j) = χ2(±k) = 0.
This completes the determination of the character table of Q8.

Proof. The elements of D8 are
e, α, α2, α3, β, αβ, α2β, α3β
and these satisfy the relations
α4 = e = β2,
βαβ = α−1.
The conjugacy classes are the sets
{e}, {α2}, {α, α3}, {β, α2β}, {αβ, α3β}.
There are two obvious 1-dimensional representations, namely the trivial one ρ1 and also ρ2,
where
ρ2(α) = 1,
ρ2(β) = −1.
The character of ρ2 is determined by
χ2(αr) = 1,
χ2(βαr) = −1.
A third 1-dimensional representation comes from the homomorphism ρ3 : D8 −→C× given by
ρ3(α) = −1,
ρ3(β) = 1.
The fourth 1-dimensional representation comes from the homomorphism ρ4 : D8 −→C× for
which
ρ4(α) = −1,
ρ4(β) = −1.
The characters χ1, χ2, χ3, χ4 are clearly distinct and thus orthonormal.
Before describing χ5 as the character of a 2-dimensional representation, we will determine
it up to a scalar factor. Suppose that
χ5(e) = a, χ5(α2) = b, χ5(α) = c, χ5(β) = d, χ5(βα) = e
for a, b, c, d, e ∈C. The orthonormality conditions give (χ5|χj) = δj 5. For j = 1, 2, 3, 4, we
obtain the following linear system:

and so a = ±2. So we must have the stated bottom row. The corresponding representation is
that of Example 3.5, viewed as a complex representation. This is easily seen to have χ5 as its
character.

4. CHARACTER THEORY
Remark: The groups Q8 and D8 have identical character tables even though they are non-
isomorphic! Thus character tables cannot always tell non-isomorphic groups apart.
Example 4.29. The character table of the symmetric group S4, is as follows.

Proof. Recall that the conjugacy classes correspond to the diﬀerent cycle types of which
are represented by the following list of elements where the numbers in brackets give the sizes of
the conjugacy classes:
e [1], (12) [6], (12)(34) [3], (123) [8], (1234) [6].
So there are 5 rows and columns in the character table. The sign representation sign: S4 −→C×
is 1-dimensional and its character is
χ2(e) = χ2((12)(34)) = χ2(123) = 1
and
χ2(12) = χ2(1234) = −1.
The 4-dimensional permutation representation ˜ρ4 corresponding to the action on 4 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
has character χ˜ρ4 given by
χ˜ρ4(σ) = number of ﬁxed points of σ.
So we have
χ˜ρ4(e) = 4, χ˜ρ4((12)(34)) = χ˜ρ4(1234) = 0, χ˜ρ4(123) = 1, χ˜ρ4(12) = 2.
We know that this representation has the form
C[4] = C[4]S4 ⊕W
where W is a S4-subspace of dimension 3, for which the character χ3 is determined by
χ1 + χ3 = χ˜ρ4,
and hence
χ3 = χ˜ρ4 −χ1.
So we obtain the following values for χ3
χ3(e) = 3, χ3((12)(34)) = χ3(1234) = −1, χ3(123) = 0, χ3(12) = 1.
Calculating the inner product of this with itself gives
(χ3|χ3) = 1
24 (9 + 6 + 3 + 0 + 6) = 1,
and so χ3 is the character of an irreducible representation.
From this information we can deduce that the two remaining irreducibles must have dimen-
sions n4, n5 satisfying
n2
4 + n2
5 = 24 −1 −1 −9 = 13,
and thus we can take n4 = 3 and n5 = 2, since these are the only possible values up to order.
If we form the tensor product ρ2 ⊗ρ3 we get a character χ4 given by
χ4(g) = χ2(g)χ3(g),
hence the 4th line in the table. Then (χ4|χ4) = 1 and so χ4 really is an irreducible character.

6. RECIPROCITY FORMULÆ
49
For χ5, recall that the regular representation ρreg has character χρreg decomposing as
χρreg = χ1 + χ2 + 3χ3 + 3χ4 + 2χ5,
hence we have
χ5 = 1
2
¡
χρreg −χ1 −χ2 −3χ3 −3χ4

,
which gives the last row of the table.
□
Notice that in this example, the tensor product ρ3⊗ρ5 which is a representation of dimension
6 cannot be irreducible. Its character χρ3⊗ρ5 must be a linear combination of the irreducibles,
χρ3⊗ρ5 =
5
X
j=1
(χρ3⊗ρ5|χj)χj.
Recall that for g ∈S4,
χρ3⊗ρ5(g) = χρ3(g)χρ5(g).
For the values of the coeﬃcients we have
(χρ3⊗ρ5|χ1) = 1
24 (6 + 0 −6 + 0 + 0) = 0,
(χρ3⊗ρ5|χ2) = 1
24 (6 + 0 −6 + 0 + 0) = 0,
(χρ3⊗ρ5|χ3) = 1
24 (18 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0) = 1,
(χρ3⊗ρ5|χ4) = 1
24 (18 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0) = 1,
(χρ3⊗ρ5|χ5) = 1
24 (12 + 0 −12 + 0 + 0) = 0.
Thus we have
χρ3⊗ρ5 = χ3 + χ4.
In general it is hard to predict how the tensor product of two representations decomposes in
terms of irreducibles.
6. Reciprocity formulæ
Let H ⩽G, ρ: G −→GLC(V ) a representation of G and σ: H −→GLC(W) a representation
of H. Recall that the induced representation σ ↑G
H is of dimension |G/H| dimC W, while the
restriction ρ ↓G
H has dimension dimC V . We will write χρ ↓G
H and χσ ↑G
H for the characters of
these representations. First we show how to calculate the character of an induced representation.

Taking inner products with the irreducible characters χj we obtain the following.
(χ|χ1)D8 = 1
8 (2 −2 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0,
(χ|χ2)D8 = 1
8 (2 −2 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0,
(χ|χ3)D8 = 1
8 (2 −2 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0,
(χ|χ4)D8 = 1
8 (2 −2 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0,
(χ|χ5)D8 = 1
8 (4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 1.
Hence we must have χ = χ5, giving another derivation of the representation ρ5.

S3 we take only elements of S4 lying in S3. Hence we have
n1 = (χ1 ↓S4
S3 |χσ)S3 = 1
6 (2 + 0 −2) = 0,
n2 = (χ2 ↓S4
S3 |χσ)S3 = 1
6 (1 · 2 + 0 + 1 · −2) = 0,
n3 = (χ3 ↓S4
S3 |χσ)S3 = 1
6 (3 · 2 + 0 + 0 · −2) = 1,
n4 = (χ4 ↓S4
S3 |χσ)S3 = 1
6 (3 · 2 + 0 + 0 · −2) = 1,
n5 = (χ5 ↓S4
S3 |χσ)S3 = 1
6 (2 · 2 + 0 + −2 · −1) = 6
6 = 1.
Hence we have
W ↑S4
S3∼= V3 ⊕V4 ⊕V5.

7. Representations of semi-direct products
Recall the notion of a semi-direct product group G = N ⋊H; this has N ◁G, H ⩽G,
H ∩N = {e} and HN = NH = G.
We will describe a way to produce the irreducible
characters of G from those of the groups N ◁G and H ⩽G.
Proposition 4.34. Let ϕ: Q −→G be a homomorphism and ρ: G −→GLC(V ) be a
representation of G. Then the composite ϕ∗ρ = ρ ◦ϕ is a representation of Q on V . Moreover,
if ϕ∗ρ is irreducible over Q, then ρ is irreducible over G.
Proof. The ﬁrst part is clear.
For the second, suppose that W ⊆V is a G-subspace. Then for h ∈Q and w ∈W we have
(ϕ∗ρ)hw = ρϕ(h)w ∈W.
Hence W is a Q-subspace. By irreducibility of ϕ∗ρ, W = {0} or W = V , hence V is irreducible
over G.
□
The representation ϕ∗ρ is called the representation on V induced by ϕ and we often denote
the underlying Q-module by ϕ∗V . If j : Q −→G is the inclusion of a subgroup, then j∗ρ = ρ ↓G
Q,
the restriction of ρ to Q.
In the case of G = N ⋊H, there is a surjection π: G −→H given by
π(nh) = h
(n ∈N, h ∈H),
as well as the inclusions i: N −→G and j : H −→G. We can apply the above to each of these
homomorphisms.
Now let ρ: G −→GLC(V ) be an irreducible representation of the semi-direct product G =
N ⋊H. Then i∗V decomposes as
i∗V = W1 ⊕· · · ⊕Wm
where Wk is a non-zero irreducible N-subspace. For each g ∈G, notice that if x ∈N and
w ∈W1, then
ρx(ρgw) = ρxgw = ρgρg−1xgw = ρgw′
for w′ = ρg−1xgw. Since g−1xg ∈g−1Ng = N,
gW1 = {ρgw : w ∈W1}
is an N-subspace of i∗V . If we take
˜W1 =



X
g∈G
ρgwg : wg ∈W1


,

52
4. CHARACTER THEORY
then we can verify that ˜W1 is a non-zero N-subspace of i∗V and in fact is also a G-subspace of
V . Since V is irreducible, this shows that V = ˜W1.
Now let
H1 = {h ∈H : hW1 = W1} ⊆H.
Then we can verify that H1 ⩽H ⩽G. The semidirect product
G1 = N ⋊H1 = {nh ∈G : n ∈N, h ∈H1} ⩽G
also acts on W1 since for nh ∈G1 and w ∈W1,
ρnhw = ρnρhw = ρnw′′ ∈W1
where w′′ = ρhw; hence W1 is a G1-subspace of V ↓G
G1. Notice that by the second part of
Proposition 4.34, W1 is irreducible over G1.
Lemma 4.35. There is a G-isomorphism
W1 ↑G
G1∼= V.
Proof. See the books [J&L] and [J-PS].
□
Thus every irreducible of G = N ⋊H arises from an irreducible of N which extends to a
representation (actually irreducible) of such a subgroup N ⋊K ⩽N ⋊H = G for K ⩽H but
to no larger subgroup.
Example 4.36. Let D2n be the dihedral group of order 2n. Then every irreducible repre-
sentation of D2n has dimension 1 or 2.
Proof. We have D2n = N ⋊H where N = ⟨α⟩∼= Z/n and H = {e, β}. The n distinct
irreducibles ρk of N are all 1-dimensional by Example 4.24. Hence for each of these we have a
subgroup Hk ⩽H such that the action of N extends to N ⋊Hk and so the corresponding induced
representation Vk ↑D2n
Hk
is irreducible over D2n with dimension |D2n/(N ⋊Hk)| = 2/|Hk|. Every
irreducible of D2n occurs this way.
□
For n = 4, it is a useful exercise to identify all the irreducibles in the character table in this
way.

CHAPTER 5
Some applications to group theory
In this chapter we will see some applications of representation theory to Group Theory.
1. Characters and the structure of groups
In this section we will give some results relating the character table of a ﬁnite group to its
subgroup structure.
Let ρ: G −→GLC(V ) be a representation for which dimC V = n. Deﬁne the subset
ker χρ = {g ∈G : χρ(g) = χρ(e)}
Proposition 5.1. ker χρ = ker ρ and hence ker χρ is a normal subgroup of G.
Proof. For g ∈ker χρ, let v = {v1, . . . , vn} be a basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of ρg,
so ρgvk = λkvk for suitable λk ∈C, and indeed each λk is a root of unity and so has the form
λk = etki for tk ∈R. Then
χρ(g) =
n
X
k=1
λk.
Recall that for t ∈R, eti = cos t + i sin t. Hence
χρ(g) =
n
X
k=1
cos tk + i
n
X
k=1
sin tk.
Since χρ(e) = n,
n
X
k=1
cos tk = n,
which can only happen if each cos tk = 1, but then sin tk = 0. So we have all λk = 1 which
implies that ρg = IdV . Thus ker χρ = ker ρ as claimed.
□
Now let χ1, . . . , χr be the distinct irreducible characters of G and r = {1, . . . , r}.
Proposition 5.2. Tr
k=1 ker χk = {e}.
Proof. Set K = Tr
k=1 ker χk ⩽G. By Proposition 5.1, for each k, ker χk = ker ρk, hence
N ◁G. Indeed, since N ⩽ker ρk there is a factorisation of ρk : G −→GLC(Vk),
G
p−→G/K
ρ′
k
−→GLC(Vk),
where p: G −→G/K is the quotient homomorphism. As p is surjective, it is easy to check
that ρ′
k is an irreducible representation of G/K, with character χ′
k. Clearly the χ′
k are distinct
irreducible characters of G/K and nk = χk(e) = χ′
k(eK) are the dimensions of the corresponding
irreducible representations.
By Corollary 4.20, we have
n2
1 + · · · + n2
r = |G|
since the χk are the distinct irreducible characters of G. But we also have
n2
1 + · · · + n2
r ⩽|G/K|
53

54
5. SOME APPLICATIONS TO GROUP THEORY
since the χ′
k are some of the distinct irreducible characters of G/K. Combining these we have
|G| ⩽|G/K| which can only happen if |G/K| = |G|, i.e., if K = {e}. So in fact
r\
k=1
ker χk = {e}.
□
Proposition 5.3. A subgroup N ⩽G is normal if and only it has the form
N =
\
k∈S
ker χk
for some subset S ⊆r.
Proof. Let N ◁G and suppose the quotient group G/N has s distinct irreducible repre-
sentations σk : G/N −→GLC(Wk) (k = 1, . . . , s) with characters ˜χk. Each of these gives rise to
a composite representation of G
σ′
k : G
q−→G/N
σk
−→GLC(Wk)
and again this is irreducible because the quotient homomorphism q: G −→G/N is surjective.
This gives s distinct irreducible characters of G, so each χσ′
k is actually one of the χj.
By Proposition 5.2 applied to the quotient group G/N,
s\
k=1
ker σk =
s\
k=1
ker ˜χk = {eN},
hence since ker σ′
k = q−1 ker σk, we have
s\
k=1
ker χσ′
k =
s\
k=1
ker σ′
k = N.
Conversely, for any S ⊆r, T
k∈S ker χk ◁G since for each k, ker χk ◁G.
□
Corollary 5.4. G is simple if and only if for every irreducible character χk ̸= χ1 and
e ̸= g ∈G, χk(g) ̸= χk(e). Hence the character table can be used to decide whether G is simple.
Corollary 5.5. The character table can be used to decide whether G is solvable.
Proof. G is solvable if and only if there is a sequence of subgroups
{e} = Gℓ◁Gℓ−1 ◁· · · ◁G1 ◁G0 = G
for which the quotient groups Gs/Gs+1 are abelian. This can be seen from the character table.
For a solvable group we can take the subgroups to be the lower central series given by G(0) = G,
and in general G(s+1) = [G(s), G(s)]. It is easily veriﬁed that G(s) ◁G and G(s)/G(s+1) is abelian.
By Proposition 5.3 we can now check whether such a sequence of normal subgroups exists using
the character table.
□
We can also deﬁne the subset
ker |χρ| = {g ∈G : |χρ(g)| = χρ(e)}.
Proposition 5.6. ker |χρ| is a normal subgroup of G.

2. A RESULT ON REPRESENTATIONS OF SIMPLE GROUPS

with equality if and only if cos(tk −tℓ) = 1 whenever 1 ⩽k < ℓ⩽n. But if |χρ(g)| = χρ(e) = n,
then we must have n2 ⩽n2 with equality if and only if cos(tk −tℓ) = 1 for all k, ℓ. Assuming
that tj ∈[0, 2π) for each j, we must have tℓ= tk, since we do indeed have equality here. Hence
ρ(g) = λg IdV . In fact we have |λg| = 1 since eigenvalues of ρg are roots of unity.
If g1, g2 ∈ker |χρ|, then
ρg1g2 = λg1λg2 IdV
and so g1g2 ∈ker |χρ|, hence ker |χρ| is a subgroup of G. Normality is also easily veriﬁed.
□
2. A result on representations of simple groups
Let G be a ﬁnite non-abelian simple group (hence of order |G| > 1). We already know that
G has no non-trivial 1-dimensional representations.
Theorem 5.7. An irreducible 2-dimensional representation of a ﬁnite non-abelian simple
group G is trivial.
Proof. Suppose we have a non-trivial 2-dimensional irreducible representation ρ of G. By
choosing a basis we can assume that we are considering a representation ρ: G −→GLC(C2). We
can form the composite det ◦ρ: G −→C× which is a homomorphism whose kernel is a proper
normal subgroup of G, hence must equal G. Hence ρ: G −→SLC(C2), where
SLC(C2) = {A ∈GLC(C2) : det A = 1}.
Now notice that since ρ is irreducible and 2-dimensional, Proposition 4.21 tells us that |G|
is even (this is the only time we have actually used this result!) Now by Cauchy’s Lemma,
Theorem 2.13, there is an element t ∈G of order 2. Hence ρt ∈SLC(C2) also has order 2 since
ρ is injective. Since ρt satisﬁes the polynomial identity
ρ2
t −I2 = O2,
its eigenvalues must be ±1. But by Theorem 4.5 we know that we can diagonalise ρt, hence at
least one eigenvalue must be −1. If one eigenvalue were 1 then for a suitable invertible matrix
P we would have
PρtP −1 =
·1
0
0
−1
¸
implying det ρt = −1, which contradicts the fact that det ρt = 1. Hence we must have −1 as a
repeated eigenvalue and so for suitable invertible matrix P,
PρtP −1 =
·−1
0
0
−1
¸
= −I2

56
5. SOME APPLICATIONS TO GROUP THEORY
and hence
ρt = P −1(−I2)P = −I2.
For g ∈G,
ρgtg−1 = ρgρtρ−1
g
= ρg(−I2)ρ−1
g
= −I2 = ρt,
and since ρ is injective, gtg−1 = t. Thus e ̸= t ∈Z(G) = {e} since Z(G) ◁G. This provides a
contradiction.
□
3. A Theorem of Frobenius
Let G be a ﬁnite group and H ⩽G a subgroup which has the following property:
For all g ∈G −H, gHg−1 ∩H = {e}.
Such a subgroup H is called a Frobenius complement.
Theorem 5.8 (Frobenius’s Theorem). Let H ⩽G be a Frobenius complement and let
K = G −
[
g∈G
gHg−1 ⊆G,
the subset of G consisting of all elements of G not conjugate to elements of H. Then N = K∪{e}
is a normal subgroup of G which is the semidirect product G = N ⋊H.
Such a subgroup N is said to be a Frobenius kernel of G.
The remainder of this section will be devoted to giving a proof of this theorem using Char-
acter Theory. We begin by showing that
(3.1)
|K| = |G|
|H| −1.
First observe that if e ̸= g ∈xHx−1 ∩yHy−1, then e ̸= x−1gx ∈H ∩x−1yHy−1x; the latter
can only occur if x−1y ∈H. Notice that the normalizer NG(H) is no bigger than H, hence
NG(H) = H. Thus there are exactly |G|/| NG(H)| = |G|/|H| distinct conjugates of H, with
only one element e in common to two or more of them. So there are exactly
|G|
|H|(|H| −1) + 1
elements of G which are conjugate to elements of H. Hence,
|K| = |G| −|G|
|H|(|H| −1) −1 = |G|
|H| −1.
Now let α ∈C(H) be a class function on the group H. Then we can deﬁne a function
˜α: G −→C by
˜α(g) =
(
α(xgx−1)
if xgx−1 ∈H,
α(e)
if g ∈K.
This is well deﬁned and also a class function on G. We also have
(3.2)
˜α = α ↑G
H −α(e)(χ ↑G
H −χG
1 ),
where we use the notation of Ex.
Sh. 4 Qu. 3.
In fact, χ ↑G
H −χG
1 is the character of a
representation of G.

3. A THEOREM OF FROBENIUS

Given two class functions α, β on H,

If χ is an irreducible character of H, then by Proposition 4.17 we have
(˜χ|˜χ)G = (χ|χ)H = 1.
Also, Equation (3.2) implies that
˜χ =
X
j
mjχG
j ,
where mj ∈Z and the χG
j are the distinct irreducible characters of G. Using Frobenius Reci-
procity (Theorem 4.32), these coeﬃcients mj are given by
mj = (˜χ|χG
j )G = (χ|χG
j ↓G
H)H ⩾0
since χ, χG
j
↓G
H are characters of H. As ˜χ(e) = χ(e) > 0, ˜χ is itself the character of some
representation ρ of G, i.e., ˜χ = χρ. Notice that
N = {g ∈G : χρ(g) = χρ(e)} = ker ρ.
Hence, by Proposition 5.1, N is a normal subgroup of G.
Now H ∩N = {e} by construction. Moreover,
|NH| ⩾|H|| |N| = |G|,
hence NH = NH = G. So G = N ⋊H. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.8.
An equivalent formulation of this result is the following which can be found in Chapter 6 of
[A&B].
Theorem 5.9 (Frobenius’s Theorem: group action version). Let the ﬁnite group G
act transitively on the set X, and suppose that each element g ̸= e ﬁxes at most one element of
X, i.e., |Xg| ⩽1. Then
N = {g ∈G : |Xg| = 0} ∪{e}
is a normal subgroup of G.
Proof. Let x ∈X be ﬁxed by some element of G not equal to the identity element e, and
let H = StabG(x). Then for k ∈G −H, k · x ̸= x has
StabG(k · x) = k StabG(x)k−1 = kHk−1.
If e ̸= g ∈H ∩kHk−1, then g stabilizes x and k · x, but this contradicts the assumption on the
number of ﬁxed points of elements in G. Hence H is a Frobenius complement. The result then
follows from Theorem 5.8.
□

5. SOME APPLICATIONS TO GROUP THEORY
Example 5.10. The subgroup H = {e, (12)} ⩽S3 satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 5.8.
Then
[
g∈S3
gHg−1 = {e, (12), (13), (23)}
and N = {e, (123), (132)} is a Frobenius kernel.

CHAPTER 6
Automorphisms and extensions
In this chapter we will study how a ﬁnite group G with a normal subgroup N ◁G is ‘built
up’ from N and the quotient group Q = G/N. We will also study actions of one group on
another by automorphisms.
1. Automorphisms
Let G be a group. A homomorphism ϕ: G −→G is called an endomorphism of G, and an
automorphism if it is invertible. The set of all automorphisms of G is denoted Aut(G), and
forms a group under composition of functions.
If g ∈G, then conjugation by g gives rise to a function
conjg : G −→G; conjg(x) = gxg−1,
which satisﬁes the conditions
conjg(xy) = conjg(x) conjg(y),
conjg ◦conjg−1 = IdG = conjg−1 ◦conjg,
conjg ◦conjh = conjgh .
Hence, conjg ∈Aut(G) with inverse conjg−1. Such automorphisms are called inner and form a
subgroup Inn(G) ⩽Aut(G). There is also the conjugation homomorphism
conj: G −→Aut(G); conj(g) = conjg .
The image of conj is Inn(G), while its kernel is the centre of G,
Z(G) = {c ∈G : ∀g ∈G, cg = gc}.
Theorem 6.1. For a group G, and its conjugation homomorphism conj: G −→Aut(G), we
have the following.
a) There is an isomorphism
G/ Z(G) ∼= Inn(G).
b) Inn(G) is a normal subgroup of Aut(G).
Proof. a) This follows from the above observations that ker conj = Z(G) and im conj =
Inn(G).
b) Let θ ∈Aut(G) be any automorphism and g ∈G. Then
θ ◦conjg ◦θ−1(x) = θ(gθ−1(x)g−1)
= θ(gθ−1(x)g−1)
= θ(g)θ(θ−1(x))θ(g−1)
= θ(g)(x)θ(g)−1
= conjθ(g)(x),
Hence
θ ◦conjg ◦θ−1 = conjθ(g) .
□

6. AUTOMORPHISMS AND EXTENSIONS
The quotient group Aut(G)/ Inn(G) is called the group of outer automorphisms of G, and is
denoted Out(G). An automorphism θ ∈Aut(G)−Inn(G) is often referred to as outer, although
strictly speaking we should refer to its coset θ ∈Inn(G) as an outer automorphism.
Example 6.2. Let G = ⟨γ⟩∼= Z/n, a cyclic group of order n ⩾1. Then as G is abelian,
Inn(G) = {IdG} since Z(G) = G. On the other hand, we have many outer automorphisms of G
as is shown in the following result which may be familiar; proofs can be found in many books,
including [JBF].
Theorem 6.3. Let G = ⟨γ⟩∼= Z/n be cyclic of order n ⩾1.
a) If n = ab where a, b ⩾1 and (a, b) = 1, then
G ∼= Z/a × Z/b.
Hence
Aut(G) ∼= Aut(Z/a) × Aut(Z/b).
b) If n = pk where p is a prime and k ⩾1, then
Aut(G) ∼=











Z/(p −1) × Z/pk−1
if p is odd,
Z/2 × Z/2k−2
if p = 2 and k ⩾2,
Z/2
if n = 4,
{0}
if n = 2.
c) In general, Aut(Z/n) ∼= (Z/n)×, the group of units in Z/n, and
| Aut(G)| = ϕ(n),
where ϕ is the Euler ϕ-function.
Example 6.4. The automorphism group of G = Z/2 × Z/2 has order 6 and is isomorphic
to S3.
Proof. Let
0 = (0, 0), u = (1, 0), v = (0, 1), w = (1, 1).
Then for an endomorphism θ of G, the eﬀect of θ on any element is given by its eﬀect on u and
v since every element is of the form ru + sv and hence
θ(ru + sv) = rθ(u) + sθ(v).
Moroever, such an endomorphism is an automorphism if and only if it is injective, which is true
if and only if
θ(u) ̸= 0
and
θ(v) /∈{θ(u), 0}.
Equivalently, an automorphism must permute the three elements u, v, w. In fact every permu-
tation of these extends uniquely to an automorphism (it must send (0, 0) to itself). Thus, we
see that there is a one-one correspondence between Aut(Z/2×Z/2) and Perm({u, v, w}), which
is in fact a group isomorphism. But the latter has 6 elements.
□
The group Aut(Z/2 × Z/2) is called the 2 × 2 general linear group over Z/2 and is usually
written GL2(Z/2) or just GL2(2).
Definition 6.5. For a prime p, the automorphism group of (Z/p)n = Z/p × · · · × Z/p (p
factors) is called the n × n general linear group over Z/p and is denoted GLn(Z/p) or GLn(p).
The following result will not be used in it general form, but is nevertheless important.

1. AUTOMORPHISMS
61
Theorem 6.6. For a prime p, GLn(p) is isomorphic to the group of all n × n matrices over
Z/p. The order of GLn(p) is
|GLn(p)| = (pn −1)(pn −p)(pn −p2) · · · (pn −pn−1) = p(n
2)(pn −1)(pn−1 −1) · · · (p −1).
To see where the ﬁrst part of this comes from, notice that if we write elements of (Z/p)n as
column vectors with entries in Z/p. Let ek be the column vector with all entries 0 except for 1p
in the kth place. Then for any ϕ ∈GLn(p), we can form the n × n matrix [ϕ] with
[ϕ]ij = aij
where
ϕ(ej) =
n
X
r=1
arjer.
It turns out that
[ϕ ◦ϕ′] = [ϕ][ϕ′]
and so this gives a homomorphism from GLn(p) to the group of all invertible n × n matrices;
this is in fact an isomorphism. The order of this group is obtained by a counting argument.
One reason for being interested in such groups is the following result. There is a determinant
homomorphism det: GLn(p) −→Z/p×, where the latter is the group of units in the ring Z/p
and is of order (p −1). The kernel of det, ker det is called special linear group of n × n matrices
over Z/p and denoted SLn(p). Notice that the order of SLn(p) is |GLn(p)|/(p −1) since det is
surjective.
Theorem 6.7. For each prime p and n ⩾1, the centre of SLn(p) is given by
Z(SLn(p)) = {λIn ∈SLn(p) : λ ∈(Z/p)×, λn = 1}.
which is cyclic of order equal to the highest common factor of n and (p −1), (n, p −1).
For n ⩾2 and p ̸= 2, 3, the quotient group SLn(p)/ Z(SLn(p)) is simple.
Notice that the order of SLn(p)/ Z(SLn(p)) is |GLn(p)|/(p −1)(n, p −1). For example, if
p = 7 and n = 2, the order is
7(2
2)(72 −1)(7 −1)/((7 −1) × 2) = 7 × 48/2 = 168.
Definition 6.8. A subgroup H ⩽G is called a characteristic subgroup of G if ϕ(H) = H
for each automorphism ϕ ∈Aut(G).
Proposition 6.9. A characteristic subgroup H ⩽G is a normal subgroup.
Proof. For each g ∈G, conjugation by g gives an automorphism conjg : G −→G. But
then conjg(H) = H. Expanding the deﬁnition of conjg(H), we get
conjg(H) = {ghg−1 : h ∈H} = gHg−1,
hence gHg−1 = H for every g ∈G. Thus H ◁G.
□
Proposition 6.10. The centre Z(G) and commutator subgroup [G, G] are characteristic
subgroups. More generally, the subgroups G(r), G(r), Zr(G) in the derived, lower central and
upper central series are all characteristic subgroups.
Proof. Let c ∈Z(G). Then for any ϕ ∈Aut(G) and g ∈G we have
ϕ(c)g = ϕ(c)ϕ

Hence ϕ(Z(G)) ⩽Z(G). A similar argument with ϕ−1 gives ϕ−1(Z(G)) ⩽Z(G), hence Z(G) ⩽
ϕ(Z(G)). Combining these results gives ϕ(Z(G)) = Z(G).

6. AUTOMORPHISMS AND EXTENSIONS
The commutator subgroup [G, G] is generated by all elements of the form [x, y] = xyx−1y−1
for x, y ∈G. For ϕ ∈Aut(G), we have
ϕ([x, y]) = ϕ(xyx−1y−1) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y)ϕ(x−1)ϕ(y−1) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y)ϕ(x)−1ϕ(y)−1 = [ϕ(x), ϕ(y)].
Hence, ϕ([G, G]) ⩽[G, G]. Similarly, we have ϕ−1([G, G]) ⩽[G, G]. Combining these we obtain
ϕ([G, G]) = [G, G].
The remaining cases follow by inductive arguments and are left as exercises.

2. Extensions
Let G be a group and N ◁G a normal subgroup. Then every element g ∈G acts on N by
conjugation,
g · n = gng−1.
Equivalently, the conjugation map conjg : G −→G restricts to an automorphism conjN
g : N −→
N of the group N. This will not be an inner automorphism of the group N in general. Thus
we have a homomorphism
conjN : G −→Aut(N);
g 7→conjN
g .
From now on, to ease the technical details we will assume that N = A is an abelian group.
Definition 6.11. Given groups Q and N together with a homomorphism ϕ: Q −→Aut(N),
we say that a group G is an extension of N by Q with action ϕ and sometimes write
1 −→N
j−→G π−→Q −→1,
if the following conditions apply.
Extn-1 there is an injective homomorphism j : N −→G whose image j(N) is a normal sub-
group of G, hence we can interpret N as a normal subgroup of G with j being the
inclusion map;
Extn-2 there is a surjective homomorphism π: G −→Q with kernel equal to N;
Extn-3 the action ϕ satisﬁes the equation
conjN
g = ϕ(π(g))
(g ∈G).
Given such an extension, notice the following. The homomorphism π gives rise to an iso-
morphism π: G/N ∼= Q, thus we will often identify Q with G/N. If we choose for each el-
ement gN = Ng ∈G/N a representative s(gN) ∈gN, this amounts to deﬁning a function
s: G/N −→G such that π ◦s = IdQ, i.e., π(s(gN)) = gN; we can even choose s so that
s(eN) = e. Then every element g ∈G can be uniquely written in the form g = ns(gN) where
n ∈N. Let us consider what happens when we write the product of two elements in this form.
We have
(n1s(g1N))(n2s(g2N)) = n1 s(g1N)n2s(g1N)−1s(g1N)s(g2N)
= n1 ϕ(s(g1N))(n2) s(g1N g2N)
= n1ϕ(s(g1N))(n2)ν(g1N, g2N)s(g1g2N),
where ν(g1N, g2N) ∈N is an element depending on g1N and g2N, which we will view as
determined by a function ν : Q × Q −→N.
In fact, given the data consisting of two groups N, Q, a homomorphism ϕ: Q −→Aut(N)
and a function ν : Q × Q −→N, we can build an extension E of N by Q with action ϕ as
follows, provided that ν satisﬁes certain conditions which will be discussed in the next section.
Here is an example, where we take ν(b1, b2) = eN for all b1, b2 ∈Q. To simplify the notation,
we will often put ba = ϕ(b)(a). We take
Eϕ = N × Q = {(a, b) : a ∈N, b ∈Q}

2. EXTENSIONS
63
and deﬁne a product on Eϕ by
(2.1)
(a1, b1)(a2, b2) = (a1b1a2, b1b2).
This is associative since
((a1, b1)(a2, b2)) (a3, b3) = (a1b1a2, b1b2)(a3, b3)
= (a1b1a2b1b2a3, b1b2b3)
= (a1b1(a2b2a3), b1b2b3)
= (a1, b1)(a2b2a3, b2b3)
= (a1, b1) ((a2, b2)(a3, b3)) .
We also have
(eN, eQ)(a, b) = (eN eQa, eQb) = (a, b),
and similarly
(a, b)(eN, eQ) = (a, b),
thus (eN, eQ) is an identity. Finally,
(b−1(a−1), b−1)(a, b) = (b−1(a−1)b−1a, b−1b)
= (b−1(a−1)b−1a, eQ)
= (b−1(a−1a), eQ)
= (b−1eN, eQ)
= (eN, eQ)
= (aa−1, eQ)
= (aeQ(a−1), eQ)
= (abb−1(a−1), eQ)
= (ab(b−1(a−1)), bb−1)
= (a, b)(b−1(a−1), b−1),
which implies that (a, b) has inverse
(a, b)−1 = (b−1(a−1), b−1).
Combining these results we see that Eϕ is a group. There is an inclusion map j : N −→Eϕ
deﬁned by
j(a) = (a, eQ),
and a quotient map π: Eϕ −→Q deﬁned by
π(a, b) = b,
both of which are homomorphisms.
This extension Eϕ is called the semi-direct product of N and Q for the action ϕ and written
Eϕ = N ⋊
ϕ H.
If ϕ(b) = IdN for all b ∈Q we have Eϕ = N × Q, the direct product of N and Q. So the
semi-direct product generalises the direct product.
Proposition 6.12. Let G be a group, N ◁G, H ⩽G and suppose that G = HN = NH and
H ∩N = {e}. Then G is an extension of H by N and moreover, G ∼= N ⋊ϕ H.

64
6. AUTOMORPHISMS AND EXTENSIONS
Proof. Here we use the notation
AB = {ab : a ∈A, b ∈B}
for two subgroups A, B ⩽G. Warning: in general this is not a subgroup of G! If A or B is
normal in G, then AB = BA and this is a subgroup of G.
We will deﬁne a homomorphism ϕ: H −→Aut(N). Notice that since N is normal in G, for
each h ∈H, hNh−1 = N, hence we can take
ϕ(h) = conjN
h ∈Aut(N).
We take j : N −→G to be the inclusion map and deﬁne q: G −→H by using the fact that
there is a composite homomorphism
θ: H −→G −→G/N
deﬁned by
h 7−→hN.
This is an injection since hN = eN if and only if h ∈H ∩N = {e}. It is surjective since for
every g ∈G, g = hn with h ∈H and n ∈N, hence gN = hnN = hN. Thus we can take
q: G −→H to be the composite
G −→G/N
θ−1
−−→H
which is surjective since the quotient map G −→G/N is. It is now straightforward to verify
that the above conditions for an extension hold.
□
Given an action homomorphism ϕ: Q −→Aut(N), two extensions
1 −→N
j1
−→G1
π1
−→Q −→1,
1 −→N
j2

π2

are said to be equivalent if there is a homomorphism θ: G1 −→G2 for which the following

in the sense that θ ◦j1 = j2 and π2 ◦θ = π1. Note that such a homomorphism is necessarily an
isomorphism. An extension which is equivalent to a semi-direct product is called split.
Example 6.13. The symmetric group S3 is a split extension of Z/3 by Z/2 with the non-
trivial action of Z/2 ∼= (Z/3)×.
Proof. We will use Proposition 6.12. For the normal subgroup N take N = ⟨(123)⟩∼= Z/3,
and for H take H = ⟨(12)⟩∼= Z/2. Then the action of H on N is given by
(12)((123)k) = (123)2k = (123)−k.
Clearly we have N ∩H = {e}. Hence S3 ∼= N ⋊H with the above action.
□
Example 6.14. The dihedral group of order 2n is generated by D2n two elements α, β of
orders |α| = n and |β| = 2 which satisfy the relation
βαβ = α−1.
Then D2n is split extension of Z/n ∼= ⟨α⟩by Z/2 ∼= ⟨β⟩with the action given by
β(αk) = α−k.

3. CLASSIFYING EXTENSIONS [OPTIONAL EXTRA MATERIAL]
65
Proof. Again we will use Proposition 6.12.
For the normal subgroup N take N = ⟨α⟩∼= Z/n, and for H take H = ⟨β⟩∼= Z/2. Clearly
we have N ∩H = {e}. Hence D2n ∼= ⟨α⟩⋊⟨β⟩.
□
Example 6.15. Let Q8 be the quaternion group of order 8, discussed in Subsection 7.1,
with elements
±1, ±i, ±j, ±k.
In this group, the centre is Z(Q8) = {±1}.
If we let Z/2 × Z/2 act trivially on Z(Q8) ∼= Z/2, then Q8 is a non-split extension of Z/2 by
Z/2 × Z/2.
Proof. If Q8 = {±1} ⋊H for some H ⩽Q8, we would have H ∼= Z/2 × Z/2. Notice that
apart from the identity element every element of this group is of order 2. But the elements of
Q8 −{±1} are all of order 4, hence there can be no such subgroup H.
□
3. Classifying extensions [optional extra material]
We will now discuss the classiﬁcation of extensions of N by Q for a given action ϕ: Q −→
Aut(N). To ease the technical details we will assume that N = A is an abelian group. We will
continue to use the notation ba = ϕ(b)(a) for a ∈Q and a ∈A. Using properties of the action
ϕ we obtain the identities
b(a1a2) = ba1ba2,
b1b2a = b1 ³
b2a
´
.
So suppose that we have an extension
1 −→A
j−→G π−→Q −→1
with action ϕ: Q −→Aut(A). We will view j as the inclusion of a normal subgroup and also
interpret Q as the quotient group G/A with π the projection given by π(g) = gA.
Suppose that we have a function s: Q −→G with the following properties:
π(s(x)) = x
(x ∈Q);
(i)
s(eQ) = eG.
(ii)
The function s is called a section and its image im s is called a transversal of A in G. Since G
is the disjoint union of the distinct cosets Ag = gA and these have empty intersection, the ﬁrst
of these conditions amounts to the fact that any g ∈G has a unique expression as
g = as(π(g))
(a ∈A).
For a ∈A and b ∈Q we have
ba = s(b)as(b)−1.
Notice that this is independant of the actual function s used, since A is abelian and hence for
a second section s′, we have s′(b)s(b)−1 ∈A, giving
s′(b)as′(b)−1 = (s′(b)s(b)−1)s(b)as(b)−1(s′(b)s(b)−1) = s(b)as(b)−1.
For b1, b2 ∈Q we also have
s(b1)s(b2) ∈As(b1b2)
since s(b1b2) ∈Ab1b2 = Ab1 Ab2.
Hence we can deﬁne a function ν : Q × Q −→A by the
equation
ν(b1, b2) = s(b1)s(b2)s(b1b2)−1.

66
6. AUTOMORPHISMS AND EXTENSIONS
The following equations are then satisﬁed by ν:
s(b1)s(b2) = ν(b1, b2) + s(b1b2)
and
ν(eQ, b) = eA = ν(b, eQ)
(b ∈Q).
A function f : Q × Q −→A is called a factor set or 2-cocycle with respect to the action ϕ
if the following hold.
f(eQ, x) =0 = f(x, eQ)
(b ∈Q);
(CoCy-1)
xf(y, z) + f(x, yz) = f(xy, z) + f(x, y)
(x, y, z ∈Q).
(CoCy-2)
Then the function ν discussed above is a 2-cocycle. Given two 2-cocycles f1, f2 the function
f1 · f2 deﬁned by
(f1 · f2)(x, y) = f1(x, y)f2(x, y)
is easily be veriﬁed to be another 2-cocycle (this uses the fact that A is abelian). In fact, the
set of all 2-cycles Z2
ϕ(Q, A) (with respect to the given action ϕ) becomes an abelian group,
with identity element the constant function taking the value eA, and the inverse of f being the
function f(−1) for which
f(−1)(b1, b2) = f(b1, b2)−1.
A 2-cocycle f is a 2-coboundary with respect to the action ϕ if there is a function F : Q −→A
for which
f(b1, b2) = b1F(b2)F(b1b2)−1F(b1) = δF(b1, b2).
(CoCy)
The set of all 2-cocyles B2
ϕ(Q, A) also a forms an abelian group which is a subgroup of Z2
ϕ(Q, A).
We deﬁne the 2nd cohomology group with respect to the action ϕ to be the quotient group
H2
ϕ(Q, A) = Z2
ϕ(Q, A)/B2
ϕ(Q, A).
To see why 2-coboundaries are of interest, consider what happens if we change the section s
above to another s′. Then the function F : Q −→A given by
F(b) = s′(b)s(b)−1 ∈A
and the 2-cocycle ν′ associated with s′ satisfy
ν′(b1, b2) = δF(b1, b2)ν(b1, b2),
hence they represent the same element of H2
ϕ(Q, A).
Theorem 6.16. Let ϕ: Q −→Aut(A) be an action with A abelian.
Let 1 −→A
j−→G −→Q
q−→1 be an extension with associated action ϕ of Q on A. Then the
coset ν B2
ϕ(Q, A) ∈H2
ϕ(Q, A) is independent of the section s used to deﬁne it. This element of
H2
ϕ(Q, A) only depends on the extension up to equivalence of extensions.
Conversely, given an element ν B2
ϕ(Q, A) ∈H2
ϕ(Q, A), any representative ν deﬁnes an
extension 1 −→A
j−→G −→Q
q−→1, which is unique up to equivalence of extensions.
These constructions set up a bijection
equivalence classes of extensions 1 −→A
j−→G π−→Q −→1
elements of H2
ϕ(Q, A).
Corollary 6.17. In this correspondence, the split extensions correspond to the identity
element in H2
ϕ(Q, A).
Proof. For a split extension we can take ν(b1, b2) = eA.
□

Theorem 6.18. Let A and G be ﬁnite groups with A abelian. If |A| = m and |Q| = n with
m, n coprime, i.e., (m, n) = 1, then any extension of A by Q is split.
Proof. We give an outline of the proof.
First note that in A the equation xn = a always has a solution, since m and n are coprime,
hence for some r, s ∈Z, rm + sn = 1 in A. As |a| | |A| we have a = armasn = (as)n. This
solution is unique since if xn = yn = a then (yx−1)n = eA and as |yx−1| | m, this implies y = x.
Let ν be a two cocycle. For each b ∈Q there is a unique solution in A of the equation
xn =
Y
b′∈Q
ν(b, b′),
hence there is a unique function F : Q −→A for which
F(b)n =
Y
b′∈Q
ν(b, b′).
Now we have
δF(b1, b2) = ν(b1, b2)
and hence ν ∈B2
ϕ(Q, A), which implies that the extension is trivial.
□
A more general version of this is contained in the following result for which a proof can be
found in [A&B], chapter 3, §9.
A subgroup H ⩽G is called a Hall subgroup if |H| and |G : H| are coprime. If N ◁G is a
normal subgroup, then a subgroup Q ⩽G for which G = N ⋊Q is called a complement of N
in G (notice that G is then a split extension of N by Q).
Theorem 6.19 (Schur–Zassenhaus Theorem). Let G be ﬁnite group with a normal Hall
subgroup N ◁G. Then N has a complement Q ⩽G in G. Moreover, any other such complement
Q′ is conjugate to Q in G.
We end with some information about extensions of the form
1 −→Z/2n −→G −→Z/2 −→1
for n ⩾1. Let ε: Z/2 −→Aut(Z/2n) denote the trivial action and τ : Z/2 −→Aut(Z/2n) the
action given by
τ(1)(t) = −t.
Lemma 6.20. We have
H2
ε (Z/2, Z/2n) ∼= Z/2 ∼= H2
τ (Z/2, Z/2n).
For the case trivial action, it is easy to see that two inequivalent extensions are
1 −→Z/2n −→Z/2n × Z/2 −→Z/2 −→1,
and
1 −→Z/2n −→Z/2n+1 −→Z/2 −→1
and these can be formed with the 2-cocycles for which
ν(1, 1) = 0,
ν(1, 1) = 2.
For the action τ, we have extensions
1 −→Z/2n −→D2n+1 × Z/2 −→Z/2 −→1

68
6. AUTOMORPHISMS AND EXTENSIONS
and
1 −→Z/2n −→Qn+1 −→Z/2 −→1
with 2-cocycles for which
ν(1, 1) = 0
and
ν(1, 1) = 2n−1.
The ﬁrst type of group is a dihedral group of order 2n+1, while the second is a quaternion group
of order 2n+1. If n = 2, these are the familiar dihedral and quaternion groups.

CHAPTER 7
Some further applications
In this chapter we will see some other applications of representation theory in mathematics
and in other subject areas.
1. Fourier series and the circle group
A ‘reasonable’ function f : R −→C which is periodic of period 2π can be expended in a
Fourier series
F(t) =
∞
X
−∞
cneti,
where the Fourier coeﬃcients cn ∈C are given by
cn = 1
2π
Z π
−π
f(t)e−ti dt.
Such a function can be viewed as deﬁning a function ˜f : T −→C on the unit circle
T = {z ∈C : |z| = 1}
which is an abelian group under multiplication (in fact, the multiplication and inverse maps are
continuous and even diﬀerentiable functions). This function is given by
˜f(eti) = f(t).
A natural question to ask is whether there is a some sort of representation theory for such a
group.
Let us ﬁrst consider the set of all ‘square integrable’ functions T −→C, L2(T). Such a
function f is required to have integrals such as
R π
−π |f(eti)|2 dt. There is an inner product on
L2(T),
(f|g) = 1
2π
Z π
−π
f(eti)g(eti) dt
which is Hermitian. Notice that
(f|f) = 1
2π
Z π
−π
|f(eti)|2 dt ⩾0,
with equality if and only if f = 0. Since T is abelian, L2(T) can be thought of as the set of
class functions on T. However, unlike the case of a ﬁnite group, L2(T) is an inﬁnite dimensional
vector space over C (in fact it is a Hilbert space). The functions χn(t) = eti (n ∈Z) form an
orthonormal set since
(χm|χn) = δm,n.
Moreover, since any function in L2(T) has a Fourier expansion, the χn actually span in the sense
that every f ∈L2(T) can be expressed in the form
f =
∞
X
n=−∞
cnχn.
Thus the χn form an orthonormal basis for L2(T) (in the sense of Hilbert space theory).
69

70
7. SOME FURTHER APPLICATIONS
What about representations of T? For each n ∈Z, there is a (continuous) 1-dimensional
representation ρn : T −→C× given by
ρn(z) = zn.
The character of this is the function χn. In fact, these ρn are the only irreducible (continuous)
representations of T. It can be shown that any ‘reasonable’ representation can be decomposed
into something like a direct sum of copies of the representations ρn. Moreover, the rˆole of the
regular representation is played by the vector space L2(T) on which T acts by
w · f(z) = f(w−1z)
(z, w ∈T).
The multiplicity of ρn in L2(T) is 1.
Thus Fourier expansions are intimately related to representation theory. In fact, any com-
pact subgroup G of a group GLC(Cn) is a compact Lie group and there is similarly a good
theory of continuous representations of G. This is the subject of Harmonic analysis on compact
Lie groups. It can even be extended to noncompact groups such as GLC(Cn) and is a major
area of research.
