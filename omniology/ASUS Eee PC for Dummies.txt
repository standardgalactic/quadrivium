About the Author
Joel McNamara started using computers in the Dark Ages (1980 to be 
precise), and if the words NorthStar Horizon, ARPANET, PDP-11, Kaypro, and 
Apple Lisa mean anything to you, like in the movie Zelig, he was there. Over 
the years Joel has worked, among other things, as a programmer, technical 
writer, and manager for a number of companies in the high-tech sector. He 
currently writes and consults on technology he fi nds interesting (like little 
Linux laptops).
Joel is also the author of GPS For Dummies, Geocaching For Dummies, and 
Secrets of Computer Espionage: Tactics & Countermeasures (all published by 
Wiley).

Next, I’d like to thank the members of the band. On bass (my Wiley acquisi-
tions editor) Kyle Looper, on drums (technical editor) Charlton Ho, on guitar, 
copy editor Mary Lagu, and on keyboard, the man who brings it all together, 
Marvelous Mark Enochs (project editor maximus). Also, everyone else at

ASUS Eee PC For Dummies 
xviii

Introduction
I
’ve used a lot of personal computers over the years. The Apple II, 
Northstar Horizons, IBM and clone PCs, Macs, Palm Pilots, and a host of 
other machines long gone and forgotten. (Saying all this is suddenly making 
me feel pretty darn old.) Having seen lots of technology come and go, I must 
admit I can be a bit jaded when new products hit the market; especially those 
that arrive with an overabundance of hype.
When I first heard all the buzz about the Eee PC, I was skeptical. The Internet 
is filled with vocal fanboys for just about any product you can think of, and I 
figured this was yet another example. Then I got my hands on an Eee PC. And 
after a couple of days, the jaded skepticism turned into surprise and satisfac-
tion as I found myself using the little laptop more and more.
Light and small (right around two pounds and about the size of this book), 
durable enough not to mind getting knocked about a bit, and considerably 
cheaper than a MacBook Air or high-end Ultra Mobile Portable Computer, 
it boots up in less than half a minute with a solid state hard drive. Eee PC is 
loaded all the hardware and software (a friendly version of Linux comes with 
lots of programs) that you need to access the Net and do personal, work and 
entertainment-related tasks from home or on the road. Sweet!
But aside from all the technical goodness, one of the things that impressed 
me the most was the Eee PC’s functional simplicity. We are living in a time 
of over-complexity. The world around us is becoming ever complicated; 
especially the electronic gadgets we use on a daily basis. The Eee PC was a 
refreshing digital breath of fresh air. It is easy to use (that’s what one of the 
Es in Eee PC stands for by the way) and almost more of an appliance than a 
traditional personal computer.
Now I won’t kid you. The Eee PC isn’t a perfect computer (if such a thing even 
exists). On most models the keys are small and I certainly wouldn’t want to 
write the great American novel on it (although I did work on this book with the 
little laptop when I was away from home). Battery life is okay, but not stellar. 
Xandros, a version of Linux, has its quirks. Hard drive space is limited.
But these are really minor nits, because the Eee PC works incredibly well for 
what it was designed to be — an affordable, highly-mobile, easy-to-use com-
puter you can use anywhere, inside or outside the home or office.
As you already guessed from the title, this book is about the Eee PC. I tell you 
everything you need to know about ASUS’ Lilliputian wonder; its capabilities, 
limitations, and how to get the most from it.

ASUS Eee PC For Dummies 
Who This Book Is For
If you’re browsing through this book at your favorite bookstore right now 
and are trying to decide whether this book is for you, ask yourself these 
simple questions:
 
✓ Are you thinking about buying an Eee PC?
 
✓ Have you recently purchased an Eee PC (or lucky you, gotten one as 
a gift)?
 
✓ Have you owned an Eee PC for a while, but want to get more out of it?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, stop reading and immediately 
proceed to the cash register because this book is indeed for you. (If you’re 
still not convinced, feel free to continue flipping through the pages to see 
what I mean.)
Although the user manual that comes with the Eee PC manual covers the 
basics, it doesn’t go into a whole lot of depth (which is perfectly understand-
able from ASUS’ perspective; you don’t want a voluminous user manual when 
you’re interested in producing an affordable computer).
With this book I take you beyond the user guide and the online help, expand-
ing on topics and programs, presenting a variety of subjects that aren’t cov-
ered, and pointing out places to get more information on the Internet. All in 
the trademarked For Dummies’ easy-to-read-and-understand style.
When the Eee PC first debuted, it was only available in models that ran a ver-
sion of the Linux operating system (you could install Windows XP if you had 
a copy). Now Windows XP comes preinstalled on certain models.
Considering this, ASUS Eee PC For Dummies is written especially for the Linux 
newbie (there’s no shame in that, we all had to start to somewhere). The 
Eee PC is a great computer to get a taste of what Linux is all about. The icon-
based Xandros version of Linux that comes installed on the Eee PC is simple 
to use, and you don’t need to worry about any scary command-line prompts 
that Linux is known for. I step you through using the operating system and 
installed programs, which is, honestly, a lot like using Windows. If you want 
to go beyond the icons and menus, I also gently introduce you to some of the 
more technical aspects of Linux.

 Introduction
Setting Some Expectations
Before getting started, I’d like to set a few expectations about the content 
you’ll be reading, just so we’re all on the same page:
 
✓ As I just mentioned, the Eee PC comes with either Linux or Microsoft 
Windows XP. I am not going to take sides (remember those fanboys I 
mentioned earlier?), but will objectively point out advantages and disad-
vantages of each operating system.
 
✓ Because Windows is so widely known and used, I spend more time dis-
cussing the Linux aspects of the Eee PC. If you own or are interested in 
a Windows model, I do have several chapters devoted to the Microsoft 
operating system. The chapters on hardware and Internet resources 
are useful for both operating systems. Even if you’re a diehard Windows 
user, you might be interested in reading the Linux chapters just to see 
how the other half lives. You might even want to try running Xandros to 
see what it’s like.
 
✓ Although I spend a fair amount of time talking about the Linux operat-
ing system and applications that come with the Eee PC, this book is not 
meant to be a manual on how to use Linux. Although I introduce you to 
the basics of using command-line Linux (which you need to know a little 
about if you want to go beyond the default Xandros user interface), it’s 
not my goal to turn you into a Linux guru.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is conveniently divided into several different parts. The content in 
each part tends to be related but, by all means, feel free to skip around and 
read about what interests you the most.
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC
This part of the book introduces you to the Eee PC. I tell you all about the 
laptop, describing available models and where to get them, walking you 
through the default hardware and software, and explaining what the Eee PC 
is (and more important, what it is not). In addition to descriptions, I also pro-
vide you with practical advice on using the Eee PC for the first time, including 
navigating through the basic user interface and connecting to the Internet 
and Windows networks.

ASUS Eee PC For Dummies 
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC
Linux versions of the Eee PC have a simple tabbed desktop user interface. 
You click a tab and available programs in a category are displayed. The 
tabs are Internet, Work, Learn, Play, Settings, and Favorites. For example to 
browse the Web, you click the Internet tab and then click a browser icon. In 
Part II, I devote chapters to each of the tabs and their associated programs. I 
describe the programs and give you helpful tips for using them and where to 
find more information. I close the part with a discussion of Windows XP on 
the Eee PC, including how it differs from Linux, what comes preinstalled on 
Windows models, and how to install your own copy of Windows XP on an Eee 
PC running Linux.
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC
After you have a grasp of the basics from the previous sections, you may 
be interested in installing different software titles on your Eee PC. I’ll walk 
you through the installation basics in the first chapter of Part III. Chapter 
13 covers popular Linux programs and how to install them. Chapter 14 is 
devoted to what I consider the best free Windows programs around (along 
with a few Eee PC specific utilities). 
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories 
for the Eee PC
With a cutting-edge solid-state drive, 802.11 wireless, an Ethernet jack, and 
Web cam (on most models), you might think the Eee PC is all ready to go. Au 
contraire. You’ll definitely want to expand the storage with SD cards, maybe 
add a DVD player/writer, perhaps charge the laptop in a car or plane, or con-
nect any number of different peripherals to the USB and VGA ports. Part IV 
is about add-on Eee PC hardware and accessories, and I discuss everything 
from adding internal memory to appropriate carrying cases to using solar 
panels to powering the laptop off the grid.
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics
Up to this point in the book, I haven’t really gotten all that techy, but in this 
part I do. Here you find chapters on backing up and restoring the Eee PC, 
how to install Advanced Desktop mode in Linux (which gives you more of a 
Windows-like desktop environment), the ins and outs of using the console 
and the Linux command line, and customizing the Xandros user interface.

 Introduction
Part VI: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books have a part called The Part of Tens, and this one is no 
exception. In Part VI, you find a chapter devoted to troubleshooting tips and 
a chapter listing what I consider to be the best Eee PC Web sites, blogs, and 
forums on the Internet. 
Bonus Chapters
In addition to the chapters you have here in the book, there are two bonus 
chapters on the companion Web site (www.dummies.com/go/asuseee
pcfd). The first provides information about installing other Linux distribu-
tions on the Eee PC. The second bonus chapter offers a handy collection of 
power-saving tips to keep your Eee PC going, and going, and . . .
Icons Used in This Book
If you’ve ever read a Dummies book before, you probably know that all sorts 
of icons are scattered through the book. This one is no different and some of 
the icons you’ll encounter include:
 
This is just a gentle little reminder about something of importance. Because I 
can’t be there to mention it in person, this icon will have to do.
 
You can easily use only the programs that come with the Eee PC and be per-
fectly happy (I’m a self-admitted geek, and after much experimenting, I found 
myself going back to using the default Easy Mode just like it came out of the 
box). However, because the Eee PC is running Linux, sometimes technical stuff 
does creep in. In such cases I’ll either give you a plain-English explanation or 
point you off to a Web site where you can get additional details.
 
This is good stuff designed to make your life easier; usually gained from practi-
cal experience and typically not found in the user guide or online help; or if it 
is there, it’s buried deep in some obscure paragraph.
 
The little bomb icon signifies some potential bad juju. When you start tin-
kering with Linux, especially if you don’t know what you are doing and just 
blindly start typing in commands, there’s a chance you can mess things up. 
(The good news is the Eee PC is quick and easy to restore.) When you see the 
bomb, pay attention! There might be something lurking in the shadows that 
causes mental, physical, emotional, or monetary suffering of some degree.

ASUS Eee PC For Dummies 
 
When I started writing this book, ASUS only offered a few Eee PC models. But 
very quickly many more models became available, and with the Eee PC 901, 
ASUS rolled out their second generation of mini-laptops. The 901 and later 
models have a few differences compared to their predecessors (first genera-
tion models are still valuable by the way, and are great values). When you see 
this icon, I point out noteworthy differences between newer and older models.
Some Things to Keep in Mind
Before you get going with the rest of the book, and I know you can’t wait, I’d 
like to mention a couple of things:
 
✓ Although this book has a whole lot more information in it than the Eee 
PC user manual, it’s a good idea to read through the manual to get the 
official ASUS word on things.
 
✓ Linux Eee PCs come bundled with a lot of software. Many of these pro-
grams have entire books devoted to their use. My goal is to introduce 
you to the programs, get you going with them, and show you where to 
go to get more information.
 
✓ There are lots of references to Web sites in this book. Unfortunately 
Web sites change just about as fast as the latest celebrity scandals. If for 
some reason a link doesn’t work, you should have enough information to 
find what you’re looking for by using common sense and Google.
 
✓ You’re not going to find every Eee PC–compatible program in existence 
mentioned in the book. I’ve tried to list and describe many of the more 
popular programs, but the realities of page-count constraints prevents 
this book from turning into an encyclopedia. So please don’t get upset if 
I didn’t mention a program you use or feel slighted because I ended up 
talking about one program more than another.
 
✓ When it comes to technology, it’s a given that after you commit some-
thing to paper it changes. I personally think there’s a conspiracy by 
hardware and software manufacturers to immediately make changes to 
their products the minute a book or two is published about them. So if 
what’s on your Eee PC screen doesn’t match how I describe it a couple 
of months after this book comes out, remember, it’s a conspiracy. I’ll 
take my tinfoil hat off now, thank you.
 
✓ Finally, the Eee PC is a wonderful little computer for kids and adults of 
all levels of technical proficiency. I’ve written this book so that if you 
have an Eee PC, you can easily follow along, doing the things I describe. 
But don’t spend all your time with your nose glued to the book. Use it 
as a guide to learning about the Eee PC and then, as my mentor told me 
years ago when I first started working with computers, “Get your fingers 
dirty on the keyboard.” Discover, experiment, and have fun!

Part I
Getting Started 
with the Eee PC

In this part . . .
I
n the fall of 2007, a small laptop appeared on the 
market that took the world by storm. Manufactured by 
Asian computer powerhouse ASUS and dubbed the Eee 
PC, the Lilliputian laptop ushered in a new era of afford-
able and ultra-mobile personal computing. Go-anywhere, 
do-anything PCs had been around for years, but ASUS 
found the just right, magic combination of size, price, and 
performance; and customers eagerly opened their wallets 
and purses.
This part introduces you to the Eee PC and explains why 
the laptop is so popular. You learn all the basics about the 
Eee PC, including differences between available Linux and 
Windows XP models, navigating the Linux user interface, 
and how to get started using the computer. Because the 
Internet and the Eee PC go together like Bogart and Bacall, 
I also provide everything you need to know about con-
necting the laptop to the Net.

Chapter 1
Meet the Eee PC
In This Chapter
▶ Not your average laptop
▶ Popular Eee PC misconceptions
▶ Reviewing Eee PC models
▶ Selecting an Eee PC
▶ Purchasing an Eee PC
T
his chapter introduces you to the ASUS Eee PC. (Eee PC is pronounced 
with a single E, not multiple EEEs, as in “Eeek, a mouse!”) If you’re won-
dering where all those Es came from, it’s from a marketing campaign that 
states the computer is “Easy to learn, easy to work, and easy to play.”
In this chapter, I tell you what the Eee PC is — and just as important, what it 
isn’t. I then list available models, describe their specifications, and conclude 
by giving you tips on selecting and purchasing an Eee PC.
Eee PC: Not Your Average Laptop
The Eee PC (see Figure 1-1) has been called a mini-laptop, a subnotebook, a 
Mobile Internet Device (MID), and a netbook (a catchy marketing buzzword for 
small, Internet-centric laptops). Whatever you call it, the Eee PC is a shrunk-
down, lightweight laptop that has these key features:
 
✓ Small — At just a bit over two pounds and roughly the size of this book, 
the 7-inch and 8.9-inch screen models are designed to be go-anywhere, 
do-anything personal computers. To fit in such a small package, keys on 
the Eee PC are smaller than those found on a typical laptop keyboard — 
right around 83 percent of normal. After you get used to the small size 
it’s possible to touch type with some practice. ASUS also offers several 
Eee PC models with larger cases (weighing around three pounds) that 
feature more usable keyboards — around 95 percent of normal size.

10
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
 
 To see how the Eee PC compares in size to other laptops, visit a great 
Web site called sizeasy (http://sizeasy.com) that compares physi-
cal dimensions of various products. Do a search for Eee PC.
 
✓ Easy to use — The Eee PC comes with a version of Linux that features 
a simple Linux user interface — it’s great for kids or adults with limited 
computer experience. Don’t let the big icons and child-like appear-
ance fool you, however, because the full Linux operating is available 
under the hood. Eee PCs with Microsoft Windows XP are also available. 
(Although it’s possible for a user to load her own copy of Vista on an Eee 
PC, the current models just don’t have enough processor horsepower to 
run Microsoft’s latest operating system.)
 
✓ Quick power up and shutdown — With the preinstalled version of Linux, 
the Eee PC boots up and is ready to use in less than 30 seconds — and 
shuts down in about half that amount of time. The laptop accomplishes 
this by doing two things:
 
• Using a Solid State Drive (SSD) — Instead of relying on spinning 
platters found in standard hard drives, an SSD uses memory to store 
data. SSDs don’t have any mechanical parts — making them more 
robust and less prone to failure. They start up and power down very 
quickly, are quiet, and have fast read and write times. SSDs are the 
wave of the future for laptops, but at present they are more expen-
sive than traditional hard drives. (ASUS has also recently added 
conventional hard drive models to its mini-laptop line.)
 
• Loading a simplified user interface version of Linux — The 
simple Linux interface doesn’t require very many system resources 
and loads rapidly. In addition, some processes are still loading in 
the background when the interface comes up and is ready to use.
 
✓ Expandable — The Eee PC features three USB 2.0 slots, a Secure Digital 
(SD) card reader, and a VGA video out port. On most models, internal 
memory can be expanded.
 
✓ Internet-enabled — The Eee PC has an 802.11 b/g wireless card (some 
models feature 802.11 b/g/n wireless) and an Ethernet jack that makes 
accessing the Internet a snap.
 
✓ Entertainment-ready — Sound card, built-in speakers, and microphone 
(as well as jacks for external speakers and microphone), a Web cam (on 
most models), and a processor and graphics chip capable of playing 
videos turn the Eee PC into a portable entertainment device.
 
✓ Lots of useful, preinstalled software — The Linux version of the Eee PC 
comes installed with all the software you need including:
 
• Open Office
 
• Firefox (Web browser)

11
 Chapter 1: Meet the Eee PC
 
• Thunderbird (e-mail)
 
• Acrobat Reader (PDF viewer)
 
• Amarok (a music player)
 
• Pidgin (an IM client)
 
• Skype (Internet phone calls)
 
• MPlayer (a media player)
 
• A photo manager
 
• Graphics programs
 
• Educational programs
 
• Several utilities
 
 The Windows XP version comes with everything that’s normally 
included with Windows in addition to Microsoft Works, Star Office, and a 
few other utility programs.
 
✓ Affordable — Even with all its features, the Eee PC is designed to be a 
low-cost, affordable computer. Depending on its features, models are 
available from around $250 to $600.

12
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
When you see an Eee PC for the first time, don’t let the toy-like appearance 
of the mini-laptop fool you. This is a real computer, and for the most part it 
can do just about anything a normal PC can (with a few exceptions, which I 
discuss later).
Because of its small size and portable nature, the mini-laptop can get a lot of 
use while on the road or around the house. I find the Eee PC especially useful 
for the following:
 
✓ Checking and sending e-mail
 
✓ Browsing the Web
 
✓ Watching videos
 
✓ Listening to music
 
✓ Instant messaging and Skyping
 
✓ Working on word processing and spreadsheet documents when away 
from a primary computer
 
✓ Viewing digital photos
 
✓ Traveling (especially on airplanes, trains, and buses)
Popular Eee PC Misconceptions
If you read the preceding section, you should have a pretty good idea of what 
the Eee PC is. But how about what it isn’t? To set the record straight, I’d like 
to spend a moment or two discussing popular misconceptions about the mini-
laptop. In no particular order, here is what the Eee PC wasn’t meant to be:
Who’s ASUS?
Eee PCs are manufactured by ASUS (pro-
nounced ah-sooss). ASUSTek (www.asus.
com) is a Taiwan-based company that makes 
computer components, peripherals, cell 
phones, PDAs, and notebook computers. The 
firm has been around since 1989, and its name 
comes from Pegasus, the mythological winged 
horse. In addition to its own products, the 
company also produces components for Sony 
(PlayStation), Apple (iPods and MacBooks), HP, 
and Compaq.

13
 Chapter 1: Meet the Eee PC
 
✓ Your primary computer — The Eee PC isn’t a replacement for your primary 
desktop PC or laptop. On most Eee PC models, the screen and keyboard 
size, slower processor, and limited internal storage space pale in com-
parison to current PCs. Think of the Eee PC as a secondary or accessory 
laptop versus a primary computer — even new Eee PC models with larger 
keyboards, screens, and drives are limited by a relatively slow processor 
(performance of the Intel Celeron and Atom chips are comparable).
 
✓ An oversized PDA — An Eee PC is a real computer. Unlike Palms, Pocket 
PCs, and smart phones, it can run most Linux and Windows programs.
 
✓ Yet another cheap laptop — I’ve often heard, “Why buy an Eee PC when 
I could get a real laptop for the same price or a little more?” Yes, in the 
same general price range you can buy a cheap, full-size laptop that has 
a DVD drive, more memory, a real keyboard, a large screen, and more 
storage. But this is like comparing apples and oranges. The Eee PC is 
designed to be used in places where lugging around a six pound plus, 
full-size laptop is a hassle.
 
✓ A high-horsepower workstation or gaming machine — The processor 
and graphics card inside the Eee PC really don’t have enough oomph to 
play graphics-intensive games or perform tasks such as video editing or 
complex image rendering.
Eee PC Models
When the Eee PC was first introduced in the fall of 2007, only a handful of 
models were available. Now a year later, you can choose from over a dozen 
Eee PC models — and according to the rumor mill, even more are on the way.
Eee PC and the OLPC XO
The origins of the Eee PC can be traced to the 
One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative started by 
Nicholas Negroponte. OLPC’s (www.laptop.
org) goal was to design an educational laptop 
that would cost $100 and make it available to 
children throughout the world; especially those 
in developing countries. The result was the 
OLPC XO-1, a technologically advanced Linux 
mini-laptop with a user interface called Sugar, 
expressly developed for kids and education.
Unfortunately, the $100 price point has yet to 
be realized, and various politics have mired 
down OLPC’s ambitions (the project may get a 
jump start, however, with Microsoft’s recent 
announcement that Windows XP would be 
available on the XO-1). On a positive note, the 
OLPC project spurred interest in small, func-
tional, inexpensive laptops, which led to the Eee 
PC and a growing number of similar computers.

14
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
ASUS has been incredibly aggressive in announcing and releasing new 
models, and it can be a little bewildering trying to keep track of them all. To 
help you sort through what’s available, here is a brief overview of all models 
currently on the market. For quick reference, Table 1-1 provides the basic 
specifications and prices, and Table 1-2 lists key features by model.
 
Be sure to check the ASUS Eee PC Web site at http://eeepc.asus.com for 
the latest information on available models and specifications — just in case 
some new mini-laptops are introduced after this book goes to press.
 
The prices I list are in U.S. dollars and are current as of the summer of 2008. 
I wouldn’t be surprised to see prices drop because of increased competition 
in the mini-laptop market. These days, just about everyone is offering his own 
version of an Eee PC-type laptop.
Eee PC 2G Surf
The Eee PC 2G (as in 2GB for the drive) Surf is the most basic and inexpen-
sive Eee PC. It runs Xandros Linux (check out the “Linux, Xandros, KDE, and 
Windows” sidebar in Chapter 11 for more information) and comes with a 
7-inch screen, a 900 Mhz Celeron processor, 512K of non-expandable RAM, 
and a small 2GB Solid State Drive. It doesn’t have a Web cam and uses a fairly 
low-capacity battery (expect about 2 hours, 45 minutes of run time). It is 
available in white, black, blue, green, and pink. Retail price is $299.
 
ASUS formerly called the Eee PC 2G Surf the 700 model and designated the Eee 
PC 4G, 4G Surf, and 8G mini-laptops as the 701 models. If you see references to 
these numbers on the Internet, you’ll know what people are talking about.
Eee PC 4G Surf, 4G
These models have the same case, keyboard, screen, and processor 
(although running at a slightly higher clock speed), as the Eee PC 2G, but 
offer expanded hardware — at a higher price point. The Eee PC 4G series 
have socketed RAM — which means memory can be expanded from the 
default 512K up to 2GB. Multiple colors are available, and you have your 
choice of either Linux or Windows XP. Models in the series include
 
✓ Eee PC 4G Surf — Similar to the 2G Surf, including the low-capacity bat-
tery, but with a 4GB Solid State Drive (SSD) and expandable memory.
 
✓ Eee PC 4G — 4GB SSD, Web cam, and higher capacity battery with a run 
time of around 3 hours, 30 minutes. Retail price is $349.

15
 Chapter 1: Meet the Eee PC
 
If you see references to an Eee PC 8G model on the Internet, this is a discontin-
ued Eee PC 4G that comes with an 8GB SSD, 1GB RAM, Web cam, and higher-
capacity battery.
 
The Eee PC is like most computers in that advertised hard drive size doesn’t 
mean you have that much storage available out of the box. For example on a 
Eee PC 4G loaded with Linux, I had around 1.3GB of free space available, with 
the operating system and installed applications taking up the remainder of the 
space.
Eee PC 701SD
The Eee PC 701SD has the same specifications as the Eee PC 4G, but comes 
with an 8GB internal SSD and a 30GB USB external drive. If that’s not enough 
space for you, ASUS also provides 10GB of online storage.
Eee PC 900 series
One of the downsides to Eee PC 2G, 4G, and 701 models is the tiny 7-inch 
(800-x-480) screen. Sure it’s usable, but a little more screen real estate is nice, 
especially when browsing the Web.
ASUS bumped up the screen size in the 900 Eee PC series. The 900 models 
have an ever so slightly larger case, but retain most of the same features as 
the 7-inch screen models (including the small keyboard) with these notable 
exceptions:
 
✓ An 8.9-inch, 1024-x-600 screen
 
✓ 1GB of RAM
 
✓ Expanded drive space
 
✓ Higher resolution Web cam (1.3 versus .3megapixel found in the 701 
series)
 
✓ Larger surface touchpad with MultiTouch support
Three Eee PC 900 series models are available:
 
✓ Eee PC 900 — This is the base model. It comes with a 4GB primary SSD 
and a second SSD for storage (20GB for Linux models, 12GB for Windows 
XP models). Retail prices range from $499 to $549 depending on model.

16
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
 
✓ Eee PC 900 16G — This model comes with a single 16GB SSD — initial 
reports seem to indicate the drive isn’t as speedy as the SSD found in 
the base model 900. Linux and Windows XP models are available, priced 
around $349.
 
✓ Eee PC 900A — The 900A is a Linux-only Eee PC. It features an energy 
efficient Intel Atom processor instead of the Celeron processor found in 
the other 900 series models. 8GB and 16GB of SSD storage are available. 
It uses a lower-cost .3-megapixel camera. The price of this new model 
has yet to be released.

* ASUS hasn’t announced prices for these new models as this book goes to press. See the 
“Purchasing an Eee PC” section at the end of this chapter for several online retail sites you can 
check for current prices.
Eee PC 901
Shortly after ASUS released the Eee PC 900 model in late spring of 2008, the 
company announced the Eee PC 901 (see Figure 1-2). This is a second genera-
tion Eee PC with the same basic features as the 900, but with these additions:
 
✓ A new case (similar dimensions, but with a more upscale look including 
metal trim and a redesigned hinge).
 
✓ Built-in Bluetooth.

18
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
 
✓ 1.6 GHz Intel Atom processor (lower power consumption with roughly 
the same performance as the 900 MHz Celeron).
 
✓ 802.11b/g/n wireless card (faster speeds, greater range, better 
connectivity).
 
✓ Improved speakers.
 
✓ Enhanced touchpad.
 
✓ Additional function keys.
 
✓ 20GB of online, Internet storage
 
✓ Power-mode control (Super Hybrid Engine) that allows you to change 
the processor’s speed to increase battery life.
 
✓ High-capacity battery. (Coupled with the Atom chip, expect battery life 
in the 4.5 to 5 hour range with WiFi on.)
For the extra features of an Eee PC 901, expect to pay around $499.

Eee PC 904HD
During the summer of 2008, ASUS announced plans for a new Eee PC that is 
a cross between the Eee PC 901 and 1000 models — I discuss the 1000 series 
next. The Eee PC 904 HD is an Intel Celeron-powered laptop that combines 

19
 Chapter 1: Meet the Eee PC
the 8.9-inch screen of an Eee PC 901 with the case and larger keyboard of the 
1000 series. The mini-laptop comes with an 80GB hard drive and is available 
in Linux and Windows XP models. A price has yet to be announced.
Eee PC 1000 series
Although the 900/901 models addressed the original Eee PC’s small screen 
size, there was still the issue of the undersized keyboard. For some users, the 
small keys just didn’t work.
Responding to customer demand, ASUS upped the ante again, and during the 
summer of 2008, it announced the Eee PC 1000 (shown in Figure 1-2 next to an 
Eee PC 901 for size comparison). This model is similar to the 901, but sports 
a larger 10-inch screen and a bigger, more usable keyboard (about 92 percent 
the size of a normal PC keyboard).
The 1000 series departs from the small form factor of the original Eee PC, and 
enters the mainstream subnotebook realm. These laptops are more expen-
sive than their smaller ASUS siblings, but are still priced considerably less 
than traditional subnotebooks — just keep in mind they also don’t have the 
performance and features typically found in costlier subnotebooks.
Three 1000 series models are currently available:
 
✓ Eee PC 1000 — This is the top-of-the-line Linux-only model that comes 
with a 40GB Solid State Drive. With the larger screen and same size bat-
tery, expect run time to be a bit less than the 901. It’s priced at $599.
 
✓ Eee PC 1000 H — The H stands for hard drive and this was the first 
Eee PC to come with a traditional hard drive — 80GB to be precise. It’s 
cheaper than the Eee PC 1000 model with the Solid State Drive, is a little 
heavier, and only comes with Window XP or Linux preinstalled.
 
✓ Eee PC 1000 HD — The third model in the 1000 series is called the 
1000 HD. It’s just like the 1000 H with an 80GB hard drive, but instead of 
an Atom processor, it uses a 900 MHz Celeron CPU (and an 802.11 b/g 
instead of b/g/n wireless card). Battery life isn’t as long, but the less-
expensive hardware components mean a lower retail price.
 
Eee PCs come in a variety of colors including basic black (ASUS calls it Galaxy 
black) and a Macintosh-inspired white. Hues of blue, green, pink, and purple 
are available with some models. Unlike other laptops, your choice of color 
doesn’t influence the price; although some colors tend to be more available 
than others.

 Chapter 1: Meet the Eee PC
Selecting an Eee PC
With the wide array of available models, if you’re interested in an Eee PC, all 
the choices can leave you a little bewildered.
My first suggestion is to review Tables 1-1 and 1-2 to get a handle on features 
and specifications of different models. Figure out which features are impor-
tant to you and narrow down your list from there.
If you’re still feeling overwhelmed, here are some general suggestions for 
selecting an ASUS mini-laptop based on who will be using it:
 
✓ Children — The Eee PC 2G and 4G models make a great introductory 
computer for kids. They’re relatively inexpensive and are fairly immune 
to minor bumps and drops. The smaller keyboard is perfect for little 
hands.
 
✓ Students — The first generation Eee PC 4G is still popular with students 
because of its small size and low price. If your budget allows, I’d look 
at the Eee PC 901 (or another model that uses the Atom processor), 
because of its longer battery life and bigger screen — Bluetooth is also a 
plus if you’ve got a compatible cell phone. Second choice would be the 
lower-priced Eee PC 900 model.
 
✓ Business people — The Eee PC 1000 series and the Eee PC 904HD offer 
more usably sized keyboards and screens. Keep in mind that with these 
models you’re trading away size and portability — refer to Figure 1-2 to 
see the difference between the Eee PC 1000 and 901 models. If you want 
small, opt for an Eee PC 901. Go for an Atom processor for increased bat-
tery life.
 
✓ Home computer users — The Eee PC is a great second computer. If you 
have a wireless access point at home, the Eee PC’s light weight and size 
make it perfect for accessing the Internet anywhere you want — kitchen, 
patio, bedroom, wherever. It’s also convenient to toss in a bag or purse 
when you head to the coffee shop. If you’re on a tight budget, I’d recom-
mend an Eee PC 4G, followed by a Eee PC 900 or 901 if you have a little 
more to spend — the larger screen is better for browsing. If you don’t 
mind a bigger case, an Eee PC 904HD offers a more usable keyboard.
 
✓ Senior citizens — For seniors I recommend an 8.9-inch or 10-inch screen 
model — they’re much easier on the eyes. A larger keyboard might be 
a plus, depending on the person. If you’re going to be using the mini-
laptop mostly around home, you can opt for a lower-priced model with a 
Celeron processor because a power outlet is always nearby.

22
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
 
✓ Techies — Take your pick — depending on how much you’ve got to 
spend in your wallet or purse. The Eee PC’s hardware and software both 
lend themselves to tinkering and customization.
 
You’ll still need to decide whether you should get a model that runs Linux or 
Windows XP. I offer some advice on that decision in Chapter 11.
Purchasing an Eee PC
If you’ve made up your mind that you want an Eee PC, and are all set to buy a 
mini-laptop, where should you go to get one? You’ve got a few options.
The easiest way is to have your credit card ready and use the Internet. Eee 
PCs can be purchased from a number of large online retailers, including the 
following:
 
✓ Amazon — www.amazon.com
 
✓ NewEgg — www.newegg.com
 
✓ Buy.com — www.buy.com
If you want to check out an Eee PC in person before purchasing, your options 
are bit more limited. As of yet, ASUS doesn’t have an extensive retail distribu-
tion network and, depending on where you’re located, it may be tough to find 
an Eee PC for a hands-on evaluation. Larger retailers such as Best Buy (www.
bestbuy.com) may stock the mini-laptop, but check around.
Before you buy, I’d suggest using Google to search for other local or online 
retailers that carry the Eee PC.
 
Almost a year after the release of the Eee PC, because of their extreme popu-
larity, a fire in a manufacturing facility that makes batteries for ASUS, and a 
shortage of Atom processors, the diminutive laptops can be scarce in certain 
markets. Internet retailers frequently sell out quickly and waiting lists are 
common. With a tight supply and big demand, don’t expect to find below-retail 
bargains. That may be changing in the very near future though. The surprise 
popularity of the Eee PC has caused just about everyone and their brother to 
start offering their own mini-laptop models. Competition is already starting to 
drive prices down and likely will into the future.

Chapter 2
First Steps with the Eee PC
In This Chapter

▶ Getting in touch with the touchpad
▶ Using a Linux Eee PC
▶ Powering off your mini-laptop
I
n this chapter, I tell you everything you need to know about getting your 
Eee PC up and running. I begin with turning on the mini-laptop for the first 
time, and then I give you some details about using the touchpad — even if 
you’re an experienced laptop user, skim through this section to see how the 
Eee PC’s touchpad may be different from your other laptop.
Eee PCs are available with either Linux or Microsoft Windows XP operating 
systems installed. Because Windows is much more widely known and used 
than the version of Linux used on the mini-laptop (a custom version of a 
product known as Xandros), I spend some time bringing you up to speed on 
the fundamentals of using a Linux Eee PC. The Linux interface is very easy 
to use, but it’s different enough from Windows to warrant a bit of discussion 
and explanation.
(If you have an Eee PC that runs Windows XP or are planning to purchase 
one, feel free to skip the section on Linux. Or better yet skim through it — 
you may decide you want to install Linux on your mini-laptop to give it a try.)
Because I start with turning on the Eee PC, it makes sense to conclude the 
chapter with turning off the mini-laptop — specifically the ins and outs of 
shutting down.
Powering On for the First Time
There’s a little more to turning on your Eee PC for the first time than simply 
pressing the power button. Read on as I explain.

24
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
Charging the battery
If you just got a new Eee PC, I’m sure you’re eager to use it. But before power-
ing on your Eee PC for the first time, I recommend you fully charge your mini-
laptop’s battery. That means
 
1. Make sure the battery is properly inserted into the mini-laptop.
 
2. Plug the power supply into a wall socket.
 
 The power supply that comes with the 900, 901, and 1000 models 
outputs a higher voltage than the 7-inch screen models. Do not use 
these power supplies with an Eee PC 2G, 4G or 8G. It’s easy to tell the 
power supplies apart because the 900/901/1000 models use a cord that 
detaches from the power supply.
 
3. Plug the power supply adapter into the Eee PC.
 
 The Eee PC is rated to handle between 100 to 120 and 220 to 240 volts of 
AC (alternating current). That means you can use the computer almost 
anywhere in the world where you can get electricity from a wall socket. 
Depending on where you travel, you may need to purchase an inexpen-
sive adapter so the plug fits the socket-type correctly.
 
4. Wait until the orange battery status light goes out.
 
 No light means the battery is fully charged. Depending on the battery’s 
discharge state, this can take up to two hours (or longer for newer Eee PC 
models such as the 901 and 1000 which have larger capacity batteries).
Status LED lights
On the right corner of the Eee PC are four LED 
status lights. Ordered from left to right, they are
 ✓ Power — When the green light is glowing, 
the Eee PC is turned on. If the light is blink-
ing, the Eee PC is in standby mode.
 ✓ Battery — When the Eee PC is turned on, 
the orange battery status light has three 
states:
 
 ✓ 
On — The battery is charging.
 
 ✓ 
Off — The battery is fully charged.
 
 ✓ 
Flashing — The battery has less than
 
10 percent life remaining. Time to find 
 
a power outlet!
 ✓ Drive — Whenever there’s drive activity, 
this light flashes.
 ✓ Wireless — When the internal wireless 
card is turned on, so is this blue light.

25
 Chapter 2: First Steps with the Eee PC
If you’re impatient and can’t wait to use your new laptop, you won’t hurt your 
Eee PC if you don’t initially top off the battery. It’s just good practice to do 
this with any battery-powered device, however, and it helps prolong overall 
battery life.
 
When the Eee PC is plugged into a wall socket, the USB ports are powered 
even if the computer is turned off. This means you can use the Eee PC to 
charge your USB devices (such as MP3 players) even when the laptop isn’t 
turned on.
Powering on
After the battery is charged, open up the Eee PC’s lid, and press the power 
button to turn it on.
The first time you run your Eee PC, you are greeted with a series of setup 
screens. Setup is obviously different depending on whether you’re run-
ning Linux or Windows, but generally it works the same. You are prompted 
for information such as which nationality keyboard you’ll be using, a user 
account name and password, your time zone, and other settings. After setup 
is done, your mini-laptop is ready to use.
 
Although Linux is a multiuser operating system, the version of Linux that 
comes installed on the Eee PC only supports creating a single-user account. 
However, running Windows XP allows you to create multiple user accounts.
Touchpad Basics
Using the touchpad on an Eee PC is just like using any other laptop. In the 
following section, however, I cover the 900/901/1000 models, which are a bit 
different.
On the Eee PC 2G, 4G, and 8G, the silver bar directly below the touchpad 
(the recessed rectangular area below the keyboard) is the mouse button. 
Although it looks like only a single button, there are actually two.
 
✓ Click the left side of the bar to left-click the mouse button.
 
✓ Click the right side of the bar to right-click the mouse button.
The 900/901/1000 models have two distinct mouse buttons like most laptops.

26
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
 
If the mouse buttons feel a little stiff and clunky, you may prefer to use the 
touchpad, which supports tapping (a tap on the touchpad is treated as a mouse 
click). I discuss configuring the touchpad on a Linux Eee PC for tapping in 
Chapter 9. In Windows, you can change touchpad settings in the Control Panel.
If you’ve never used a touchpad before, read on. Experienced laptop 
users, feel free to skip the first part of this section. However, if you have a 
900/901/1000 model, read about some important differences in the “Multi-
touch” sidebar.
The touchpad is the recessed rectangle below the keyboard. It’s the laptop 
version of a mouse.
Lightly drag your finger (whichever one feels the most natural) across the 
touchpad surface to move the onscreen cursor. Drag to the right, the cursor 
moves right. Drag up, the cursor goes up. You get it.
To move the cursor more than a short distance, simply lift your finger when 
it starts to go off the touchpad, put it back down on the touchpad, and drag 
again. Repeat until the cursor is where you want it to be.
The touchpad has what looks like a blunt sewing needle printed on its right 
side. This is a visual clue that the touchpad supports scrolling. That means if 
you drag in the touchpad scrolling area, you can control programs that dis-
play a vertical scrollbar. Drag up to scroll up. Drag down to scroll down.
 
You can change many touchpad settings, including sensitivity and whether 
tapping and scrolling are enabled. Check out Chapter 9 if you have a Linux Eee 
PC or with Windows, use the Control Panel to change settings.
Multi-touch
The Eee PC 900/901/1000 models have a larger 
touchpad that supports a feature called multi-
touch.
Multi-touch lets you use two fingers at the 
same time to navigate the screen. It’s the same 
technology found in Apple’s iPhone, iPod touch, 
MacBook Air, and Pro products.
Multi-touch is pretty cool state-of-the-art tech-
nology. In Linux programs like OpenOffice Writer 
and Impress (and various Windows applications), 
you can zoom out by placing two fingers on the 
touchpad and moving them apart — pinch them 
together to zoom in. You can also scroll windows 
by placing both fingers together on the touchpad 
and then together dragging them up or down. 
Most programs support two-finger scrolling, 
but not all programs support finger zooming.

27
 Chapter 2: First Steps with the Eee PC
 
If you’re so inclined, you can always plug a USB mouse into the Eee PC (a 
Bluetooth mouse if the model supports it) and use it instead of the touchpad.
 
In addition to the touchpad, quite obviously you can use the keyboard. Check 
out the cheat sheet in the front of the book for a list of all Eee PC function keys 
and what they do.
Using a Linux Eee PC
When you turn on a Linux Eee PC for the first time, you undoubtedly think, 
“This sure isn’t Windows.”
Linux Eee PCs run a customized version of Xandros — which features a 
tabbed desktop user interface as shown in Figure 2-1. Unlike Windows, where 
you can copy, paste, and move desktop icons around, the icons in the Linux 
desktop are fixed.
 
The Eee PC Linux desktop interface is known as Easy Mode — the interface is 
built on the IceWM window manager. Technically it’s not really a true desktop, 
since a tab window is always displayed. By default, you don’t have much con-
trol over customizing the interface as you do with Windows. This really isn’t a 
downside because it makes the Eee PC an easy-to-use computing appliance. If 
you want to tinker though, I describe some advanced techniques for custom-
izing the interface in Chapter 21.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Linux Eee 
PC desktop.
 

28
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
Reviewing the tabs
There are six tabs at the top of the desktop window. When you click a tab, it 
displays program icons associated with the tab’s label. The tabs include the 
following:
 
✓ Internet — Programs for connecting to and accessing the Internet, 
including applications for Web browsing, e-mail, instant messaging, and 
making online phone calls.
 
✓ Work — Work-related programs including a word processor, spreadsheet, 
presentation application, PDF reader, file manager, and accessories.
 
✓ Learn — A collection of educational applications including several 
graphics editors.
 
✓ Play — This tab contains a media player, music player, photo manager, 
Web cam and sound-recording utilities, and popular desktop games.
 
✓ Settings — The Settings tab has, you guessed it, programs for changing 
various Eee PC settings.
 
✓ Favorites — The last tab is Favorites. Here you add shortcuts to any of 
the Eee PC programs. It’s a convenient place to keep links to all the pro-
grams you frequently use.
In Part II, I devote chapters to each of the tabs, describing programs and 
giving you tips for using them.
 
Although the Eee PC Linux desktop is easy to use, it’s not Windows — which 
is probably the system you already have experience with. Be patient as you 
come up to speed. Learning a new operating system and user interface doesn’t 
happen overnight.
Navigating the tabs and running programs
Navigating through the Linux desktop tabs is simple. Click a tab to show the 
programs associated with it. For example, Figure 2-2 shows programs on the 
Work tab. The tab that’s currently selected is highlighted.
To run a program inside a tab, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cursor over a program icon.
 
 A highlighted rectangle appears around the icon.
 
2. Left-click the selected icon.
 
 Just once, please. You don’t double-click as you do in Windows.

29
 Chapter 2: First Steps with the Eee PC
 
You can also press the Enter key to run a highlighted program.
The program window appears on top of the desktop. The program name 
appears at the bottom of the screen in the taskbar — more about the taskbar 
coming up.
 
Hold down Alt+Tab to display all the currently running programs. While con-
tinuing to hold the Alt key down, press Tab to scroll through the programs. 
When you release Alt+Tab, the selected program is brought to the front.
Some icons in the desktop tabs are directories, even though they aren’t 
depicted as folders — for example Accessories in the Work tab. You open a 
directory just as you run a program, by single-clicking. An open directory is 
shown in Figure 2-3.
 
Directories and folders are the same thing. Some longtime Linux users will use 
the term directories (since the operating system is command-line based and 
lacks file system icons). Other users refer to folders — popularized by modern 
graphical user interface operating systems. Either term is acceptable in talking 
about where you store a group of files.
You can always tell you’re inside a directory because, to the right above the 
program icons, is a button with an arrow. Click the button to go back to the 
tab you were previously viewing.

Navigating program windows and menus
After you start running programs, you’ll find the Eee PC’s Linux user interface 
is very similar to Microsoft Windows. Generally, here’s how things work:
 
✓ Minimize, Maximize, and Close buttons for windows look and function 
the same way.
 
✓ You can resize some windows by dragging the bottom right-hand corner.
 
✓ Horizontal and vertical scroll bars look and behave the same.
 
✓ Dialog box controls work the same — you can tab through controls and 
use the spacebar and Enter keys to select and execute controls.
 
✓ Menus appear and work similarly — including keyboard shortcuts such 
as invoking a menu by holding down the Alt key and typing the under-
lined letter of a menu item.
Probably the biggest difference is the visual appearance of windows, con-
trols, dialog boxes, fonts, and icons. Although everything looks familiar, it’s 
just different enough to let you know you’re not using a Microsoft operating 
system.
 
A few Linux programs have quirky user interfaces; but for the most part, if 
you’re comfortable using Windows you shouldn’t have any trouble using a 
Linux Eee PC.

 Chapter 2: First Steps with the Eee PC
Using the taskbar
At the bottom of the Linux desktop is the taskbar (as shown in Figure 2-4).
The taskbar contains information about your Eee PC including running pro-
grams, network connections, keyboard caps and number lock status, speaker 
volume, and time. In addition, you can use the taskbar to switch between 
open programs.
The taskbar is always shown unless you choose to hide it. I discuss this in a 
minute.
 
Move the cursor over a taskbar icon to get to more information about it. For 
example, if you have a USB thumb drive inserted, placing the cursor over the 
USB icon displays pop-up information that shows how much free space is on 
the device.
 
Figure 2-4: 
Linux Eee 
PC desktop 
taskbar. 
Where’s the button?
At times you may encounter a Linux program 
that displays a window that extends off the 
screen — usually it’s a dialog box. This can be 
a problem if there are buttons or other controls 
you need to use but can’t see or click them, and 
there doesn’t seem to be any way to move the 
window up.
There’s a little trick you should know. Here’s 
what to do:
 1. Hold down the Alt key and click the left-
mouse button. The cursor turns into a cross 
with four arrows.
 2. While continuing to hold down Alt and the 
left-mouse button with one hand, use your 
other hand use to drag the window up with 
the touchpad.
 3. After you get to the bottom of the window, 
release Alt and the left-mouse button.
You can now click the button or control that 
previously appeared offscreen.

32
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
Items that are shown in the task bar include the following:
Home
The icon at the left of taskbar that looks like a house is Home. Click it to show 
the desktop. (You can also press the key with a house on it to bring the desk-
top to the front.)
Running programs
Whenever you run a program, its icon and name (or the name in the pro-
gram’s window title) appears in the taskbar. Click a program in the taskbar to 
bring it to the front.
 
You can also right-click a program in the taskbar to bring up a pop-up menu 
and close the program.
Status icons
To the right of any running programs in the taskbar are a series of status 
icons. Some status icons may be added to the taskbar and the order of icons 
changes. For example, the SD card icon appears only when you have an SD 
card inserted.
Status icons include
 
✓ Wireless — Click the Wireless icon (it looks like radio waves with a 
wrench) to display a window with available access points. Access point 
names, whether or not they use encryption, and signal strength are 
shown. (I talk more about wireless connections in Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Power — When you are running on batteries, a battery icon with white 
bars is displayed. Four bars indicate a full battery — the number of 
bars decreases as your battery discharges. When the power supply is 
plugged in, the icon changes to a power cord.
 
 Move the cursor over the battery icon to see how much battery life you 
have left. Numbers are rounded to the nearest 10 percent. The Eee PC 
provides several warnings before your battery completely discharges.
 
✓ Network Connection — There are three network status icons:
 
• If you’re connected to a wireless access point, a radio waves icon 
appears.
 
• If you’re connected to the Internet with an Ethernet cable, an icon 
with two PCs is displayed.
 
• If you’re not connected to a network, an icon with two PCs and a 
red and white X is shown.
 
 Click the Network icon to display the Network Connections dialog box. I 
discuss connecting to the Internet in Chapter 3. 

33
 Chapter 2: First Steps with the Eee PC
 
✓ Num Lk — When you press the Num Lk (Numbers Lock) key, the square 
icon with a number 1 in the center turns green. When Numbers Lock is 
turned off, the icon is dimmed to gray.
 
✓ Caps Lock — When you press the Caps Lock key, the square icon 
with an A in the center turns green. When Caps Lock is off the icon is 
dimmed.
 
 If you’re having problems correctly entering a password, always check 
whether the Caps Lock is turned on.
 
✓ SD card — If you have an SD or MMC card inserted in the card reader, a 
blue icon that looks like an SD card displays.
 
 To avoid losing data, whenever you eject an SD or MMC card, right-click 
this taskbar icon and select the Safely Remove menu item.
 
✓ Input method — This icon is for controlling the Smart Common Input 
Method (SCIM) — a way to change input for the Eee PC based on differ-
ent languages. (Depending on the model and the market the Eee PC was 
sold in, this icon may or may not be present.) Unless you’re switching 
between English and Chinese, you shouldn’t need this program.
 
✓ Volume — Single right-click the speaker icon to change speaker and 
microphone settings including volume, balance, and muting. The icon 
has a red slash through it when the volume is muted.
 
✓ USB device — When you insert a USB device, such as a thumb drive, a 
USB icon is displayed. Up to three icons may appear depending on how 
many devices you have plugged in at once. Move the cursor over an icon 
to get a short description of the device.
 
 Just as you do with an SD card, whenever you unplug a USB device, 
right-click the taskbar icon and select Safely Remove.
 
✓ Programs — Some programs may insert an icon in the taskbar when 
they are running — instead of appearing to right of the Home icon. For 
example, Notes adds an icon that looks like a sticky note. Right-click a 
program icon to display a pop-up menu of commands.
 
✓ Time — The current system time is displayed in 24-hour format.
 
 There’s not a quick way to change the clock setting to AM/PM. However 
in Chapter 21, I tell you about techniques for modifying the taskbar — 
including changing the time format.
Task Manager
The green square icon to the right of the time is the Task Manager — if you 
move the cursor over it, the letters SOS appear. The Task Manager (shown 
in Figure 2-5) shows all processes — a process is a program or piece of code 
that’s running.
You can select a process and stop it with the Kill button. This is useful if a 
program is hung and you can’t exit out of it.

34
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
 
Figure 2-5: 
The Task 
Manager

Be careful killing processes. If you stop a system process without knowing 
what you’re doing, you may be forced to restart your Eee PC.
Tips
Clicking the yellow smiley face icon opens the Web browser and displays a 
collection of Eee PC tips and tricks. Although it’s a relatively short list, it’s 
worth reading.
Shutting down
Click the taskbar’s Shut Down icon (it’s a red circle to the right of the smiley 
face) to shut down your Eee PC. I tell you more about this in the upcoming 
“Powering Down” section.
Hiding and showing the task bar
The last item on the far-right side of the taskbar is a right-facing arrow icon. 
This icon lets you hide and show the taskbar — with the Eee PC’s small 
screen, every bit of real estate can count.
 
✓ Click the arrow to hide the taskbar. The arrow icon still appears, but 
now it points left.
 
✓ Click the arrow again to show the taskbar. The arrow goes back to point-
ing right.

35
 Chapter 2: First Steps with the Eee PC
Powering Down
Using your Eee PC is a lot of fun, but at some point you must turn it off. 
Here’s what you need to know, depending if you’re running Linux or 
Windows.
Linux
If you have a Linux Eee PC, click the Shut Down icon in the taskbar — it’s the 
red circle at the far right. A window is displayed with five options (as shown 
in Figure 2-6).
 
Pressing the power button once is the same as clicking the Shut Down icon. 
However, see the following warning about pressing the button too long.
The options are as follows:
 
✓ Task Manager — Runs the Task Manager.
 
✓ Standby — Puts the laptop in standby mode — the screen goes black, 
power is reduced, and memory is written to the drive. Press the power 
button to come out of standby and resume using the Eee PC.
 
 When you close your Eee PC’s lid and it’s powered on, you also put the 
laptop into standby mode.
 
✓ Restart — Shuts the Eee PC down and then restarts it, just as you turned 
it off and then powered it back up again.
 
✓ Shut Down — Turns the Eee PC off.
 
✓ Cancel — Click Cancel in case you changed your mind and want to con-
tinue using the laptop. The Shut Down window closes.
Windows
If you’re running Windows XP, click the Start button and select Turn Off 
Computer.
 
On both Linux and Windows Eee PCs, if you press and hold the power button 
for several seconds, your mini-laptop turns off. I don’t recommend this 
because the system won’t have a chance to perform normal housekeeping 
tasks associated with shutting down. You likely won’t hurt your Eee PC, but 
you may lose data.

Getting Connected with the Eee PC
In This Chapter
▶ Connecting to the Internet
▶ Managing wired and wireless connections
▶ Finding your MAC address
▶ Using the Network Connection Wizard
▶ Integrating a Linux Eee PC into a Windows network
W
ith a built-in wireless card, wired Ethernet adaptor, and preinstalled 
networking software, the Eee PC is ready to connect to the Internet 
and local area networks.
In this chapter I tell you the ins and outs of getting connected with the Eee PC 
(I focus primarily on Linux models). I show you how to set up wired and wire-
less Internet connections, how to manage connections to networks, and how 
to connect to a Windows network so you can share files, folders, and printers.
Connecting to the Internet
Probably, one of the first things you want to do with your Eee PC is connect 
to the Internet (I discuss Internet-related programs that come bundled with 
the Linux Eee PC in Chapter 4).
You have two options: Connect wirelessly with the mini-laptop’s 802.11 WiFi 
card; or go the old-fashioned wired way, and plug a cable into the Eee PC’s 
10/100 Mbps Ethernet adapter.
Wireless connections
Anytime you want to get a wireless Internet connection, the first thing you 
do is glance down to see if the blue LED light on your powered-on Eee PC is 
illuminated. If it’s not, that means the wireless card is turned off. To turn it 
on, press Fn+F2.

38
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
With that small gotcha out of the way, here is how to find and connect to a 
wireless access point.
Finding access points
To get a wireless Internet connection, you need to be in range of a wireless
access point. To view available access points and networks, click the 
Wireless Networks icon in the desktop’s Internet tab.
 
You can also click the taskbar icon that looks like a wrench on top of radio 
waves.
This runs a program that displays visible wireless access points, as shown in 
Figure 3-1.
 
Figure 3-1: 
The 
Wireless 
Networks 
utility shows 
visible wire-
less access 
points.
 
For each access point, the following information is provided:
 
✓ Security — A lock icon indicates whether the access point is secured. 
An unlocked icon means the network is open and anyone can connect 
to it. A locked icon indicates the network is encrypted with WEP or WPA 
(two standard wireless security options) and a password is required to 
connect.
 
✓ Network Name — The name of the wireless network (by the way, ESSID 
stands for Extended Service Set ID, which is what the network name is 
officially called).
 
✓ Signal — The strength of the access point signal, shown with a bar and a 
numeric percentage value. Obviously, the stronger the signal, the better 
the possible connection.

39
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected with the Eee PC
 
You can get additional information about an access point by selecting it in the 
list and clicking the Details button.
 
Available networks and signal strength don’t automatically update if you move 
your Eee PC. You must click the Refresh button to get the most current infor-
mation about access points.
Connecting to an access point
To connect to an Internet access point, run the Wireless Networks program, 
and follow these steps:
 
1. Select an available access point from the list.
 
2. Click the Connect button.
 
3. If the access point is secured, specify the encryption type and provide 
a password.
A dialog box with status information is displayed while a connection is made. 
The dialog box closes after successfully connecting.
 
If the dialog box continues to be displayed (often Pending status is reported), 
the connection failed. This could result from an incorrect password or occur for 
other reasons. Click the Details button to view a log of detailed status messages.
 
The Eee PC can have difficulties connecting to wireless access points secured 
with WPA encryption if the password includes spaces or special characters. If 
you have trouble connecting to a WPA-secured access point, try changing the 
password so only letters and numbers are used.
If you continue to have troubles connecting, refer to Chapter 22 where I pres-
ent some tips for troubleshooting problematic wireless connections.
Automatically connecting
If you want a wireless connection (let’s say, one you frequently use at home) to 
automatically start when you boot your Eee PC, here’s what you need to do:
 
1. In the Linux desktop Internet tab, click Network.
 
2. Select the wireless connection in the Network Connections dialog box.
 
3. Click the Properties button below the list of connections.
 
4. In the Connection Properties dialog box, select On Boot in the Start 
mode drop-down list (as shown later in Figure 3-4).
 
5. Click OK.
The next time you turn on your Eee PC, it automatically connects to the 
selected network.

40
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
 
If your connection doesn’t automatically start, run the Network program, 
select the wireless network, and click the Connection button to manually con-
nect. Once connected, click the Properties button and change the Start mode 
drop-down list item to On Boot. If you’re connecting to multiple networks, 
sometimes the settings confuse the Eee PC, causing this problem. If you con-
tinue to have problems, try deleting a connection and creating a new one. I 
talk about this in the upcoming section “Managing Your Connections.”
Ethernet cable connections
The other alternative for connecting your Eee PC to the Net is to use a 
cable (this method is faster than wireless, if you have a choice). You need 
an Ethernet cable (look for a Category 5, also known as CAT 5, cable) and 
a router/switch or network wall outlet to plug into. (I always carry a short 
length of CAT 5 cable with me while on the road with my Eee PC, just in case I 
have the option of a wired connection.)
 
If you have an active wireless connection, I suggest disconnecting before you 
connect with a cable. Although it’s possible to have two simultaneous Internet 
connections, this can potentially lead to network glitches.
By default, the Eee PC assumes you are connecting to a network that uses 
dynamically assigned IP addresses (DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol). That means you shouldn’t have to do anything, just plug the cable 
in and voilà, an instant, high-speed Internet connection.
 
If you’re connecting to a network that doesn’t automatically assign an IP 
address, read the section “Using the Network Connection Wizard” later in this 
chapter. It covers connecting to a network that uses static IP addresses.
Managing Your Connections
Information about your connections, both past and present, can be found 
with the Network Connections utility. You use this program to manage your 
connections.
To run Network Connections, do the following:
 
1. In the desktop Internet tab, click the Network icon.
 
 You can also click the Network icon in the Linux desktop taskbar to run 
the program.

41
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected with the Eee PC
 
2. The Network Connections window opens, as shown in Figure 3-2. You 
can now see information for the following:
 
• Connection Name — The name you’ve given a connection, such as 
the wireless network name.
 
• Type — Whether the connection is wireless, dial-up, or local area 
network (LAN). An icon representing the network type is also 
displayed.
 
• Status — The status of the connection, such as enabled discon-
nected, or pending. (Pending means the Eee PC is waiting for some-
thing to complete the connection.)
 
Figure 3-2: 
Network 
Connections 
utility for 
managing 
connections. 
 
Connecting and disconnecting
To connect, disconnect, or reconnect, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the connection (such as a wireless access point).
 
2. Click the Connection button, which displays a drop-down list where 
you can go to connect, disconnect, or reconnect.
Certain commands may not be available depending on the connection status. 
For example if a selected connection is enabled, the Connect item in the 
drop-down list is dimmed and can’t be chosen.
A dialog box displays with status information. Click the Details button as 
the network connects or disconnects to view detailed messages as shown in 
Figure 3-3.

42
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
 
Figure 3-3: 
Detailed 
status 
information 
is shown 
while a 
network 
connects.
 
 
After you’ve connected to a wireless access point, instead of using the 
Wireless Networks program to connect to the access point in the future, use 
the Network program in the Linux desktop Internet tab. Each time you connect 
to a network, the settings information is stored in the Network Connections 
list. Wireless Networks is more of a tool for discovering and initially connect-
ing to access points.
Deleting, renaming, and copying
Clicking the Manage button gives you three options for a selected connection:
 
✓ Delete — Delete removes the connection from the list. If the connection 
is enabled, you must first disconnect it. Use this button for cleaning up 
the list by removing connections you previously made — for example, 
while traveling.
 
✓ Rename — Rename enables you to give the selected connection a 
new name. Type the name in the Connections list and click Another 
Connection to save the new name.
 
✓ Make Copy — This option makes a copy of the connection settings 
under a different name that you provide. The new connection appears 
in the Connections list. This is handy for duplicating an existing connec-
tion for editing, instead of using the Network Connection Wizard (which 
I discuss later in this chapter).

43
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected with the Eee PC
Getting and setting information
To get information about a connection, as well as to change some of its set-
tings, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the connection from the list.
 
2. Click the Properties button.
 
 A tabbed, window labeled Connection Properties is displayed as shown 
in Figure 3-4.
 
Figure 3-4: 
Properties 
window of 
a wireless 
connection.
 
Here in the Properties window, you get information about a connection and 
can edit various settings. (Be sure to first disconnect from the connection 
before making any changes.)
Click the tabs to view and set different types of information. A few of the tabs 
may be different depending on the type of connection you selected. For example, 
a wireless connection has a Wireless tab, whereas a LAN connection does not.
Finding Your MAC Address
All network adaptors have a unique identifier called a Media Access Control 
(MAC) address. The MAC address is composed of six groups of two-digit 
hexadecimal numbers. An example looks like this: 01-23-45-67-89-ab.

44
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
 
The first six digits are a vendor code identifying the manufacturer that made 
the network adaptor. The remaining digits identify the adaptor (no two net-
work adaptors have the same MAC address — although it is possible to tem-
porarily change a MAC address with software so it matches another network 
adaptor’s address). If you know a MAC address and want to look up the manu-
facturer, check out this Web site: http://coffer.com/mac_find/.
When you configure security settings on a wireless access point, it’s possible 
to use something called MAC address authentication. This means you pro-
vide a list of MAC addresses for the computers that you want to have access 
to the wireless network. Computers with MAC addresses not on the list won’t 
be able to get a wireless connection.
 
This isn’t necessarily bulletproof security because anyone who knows the 
MAC address of one of the trusted computers can change the MAC address of 
his own laptop to match it (called spoofing). With a wireless sniffer, it’s easy to 
view the MAC addresses of computers currently connected to an access point.
If you need to know the MAC address of your Eee PC, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Linux desktop Settings tab, click Diagnostic Tools.
 
2. Click the Details button.
 
3. Select Ethernet in System Information.
The MAC addresses for both the wireless card (wifi0) and wired Ethernet 
adaptor (eth0) are displayed as shown in Figure 3-5. Notice there’s a device 
named ath0 that has the same MAC address as wifi0. This is the physical 
wireless card, which is an Atheros-based card, thus ath0.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Eee PC MAC 
addresses.
 

45
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected with the Eee PC
 
You can also find out your MAC address using the Linux console (which I thor-
oughly describe in Chapter 20) and this command: sudo ifconfig –a.
Using the Network Connection Wizard
Up until now, I’ve been discussing how to access networks that are immedi-
ately available. But what if you want to set up a connection to a network you 
currently don’t have access to? Or perhaps you have a USB modem and need 
to set up a connection to a dial-up account? Or you’re dealing with a network 
that doesn’t dynamically assign IP addresses?
Your solution is to use the Eee PC’s Connection Wizard. Here’s how:
 
1. On the Linux desktop Internet tab, click the Network icon.
 
2. Click the Create button.
 
 This runs the Connection Wizard as shown in Figure 3-6.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Eee PC 
Network 
Connection 
Wizard.
 
 
3. Select the type of connection you want to make and click Next.
 
 Specify which hardware you’ll be using to make the connection, whether 
you’ll use a static or dynamic IP address, the phone number and login 
information (for dialup accounts), a name for the connection, and 
whether you want to automatically connect when the Eee PC starts up.
 
4. Click Finish to save the connection settings.
 
 The connection now appears in the Network Connections list. Click the 
Manage button to delete, rename, or make a copy of the settings.

46
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
Connecting to a Windows Network
If you have a Windows network at home (or perhaps work), your Eee PC can 
connect to it. This means that the Linux mini-laptop can access shared files, 
folders, and printers on Windows computers in the network.
 
Okay, I have to warn you. Theoretically you should be able to connect to a 
Windows network with no problems. However, sometimes it’s a pain to get 
Windows PCs even to talk to each other on a Windows network, so don’t be 
too shocked if you encounter unexplained difficulties in getting your Linux 
Eee PC onto the network. I present some troubleshooting advice in the follow-
ing sections and in Chapter 22. If that doesn’t work, I suggest you consult the 
EeeUser.com forums (http://forums.eeeuser.com). And if you’re still 
tearing your hair out, take the path of least resistance and set up a sneakernet. 
That’s where you use a USB thumb drive and walk between computers (using 
your sneakers, get it) to transfer files.
Accessing shared Windows folders
Let’s say you want to copy some files from a Windows PC on a network to 
your Eee PC. You first need to set up a shared folder on the Windows PC 
(refer to Windows online help for how to do this). After you have a shared 
folder and moved the files you’d like to share into it, you access the folder 
from your Eee PC by doing the following:
Do the Samba
Whenever you connect Linux and Windows 
computers over a network, you have to deal 
with Samba. No, I’m not talking about some 
geeks appearing on Dancing with the Stars. I’m 
referring to an open-source software package 
that allows penguins (as in Tux) and PCs to talk 
to each other.
Samba gets its name from SMB (Server 
Message Block), which is the protocol used 
by the Microsoft Windows network file system. 
Linux computers use a different networking 
protocol, and it’s Samba that provides a way for 
the two operating systems to talk to each other 
so you can access shared files, directories, and 
printers.
ASUS keeps most of the Samba nuts and bolts 
hidden from you, so you don’t need a deep 
understanding of the software and the proto-
col. If everything is working correctly, it’s just 
a matter of clicking to access Windows shares 
from your Linux Eee PC.
If you’re interested in learning more about 
Samba, visit the official project Web site at 
www.samba.org.

47
 Chapter 3: Getting Connected with the Eee PC
 
1. In the Linux desktop Work tab, click File Manager.
 
2. In the left window pane, click Windows Network.
 
 The default Windows workgroup name is Workgroup. If you have given 
your workgroup a different name, it should also appear.
 
3. Double-click your workgroup.
 
 If your Eee PC successfully connects to the workgroup, a list of comput-
ers in the workgroup is displayed as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
4. Double-click a computer to display shared resources.
 
 Any files, folders, or printers that have been shared on that computer 
are shown. An example of a connected PC running Windows is shown in 
Figure 3-8.
If no workgroups are displayed, do the following:
 
1. Right-click Windows Network and select Find.
 
 This brings up the Find Computers dialog box.
 
2. Click Start Search to look for networked computers.
 
 Any computers found are displayed in a list.
 
3. Choose a computer, right-click, and select Explore.
 
 This opens a window that displays any shared folders. (If you can’t find 
any networked computers, you may need to change your workgroup 
name. I tell you how to do this at the end of this chapter.)

If you’re running Vista and want to share resources on a Windows network, 
be sure to refer to this Microsoft Technet article: http://technet.
microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx.
Sharing a directory
To share the contents of a directory on your Eee PC across a Windows net-
work, here’s what you need to do:
 
1. On the Linux desktop Work tab, click File Manager.
 
2. Select the folder you want to share and right-click.
 
3. In the pop-up menu, choose Sharing➪Windows Sharing.
 
 This displays the Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-9, where 
you can set sharing options.
 
4. Check Share This Item and Its Contents.
 
5. Click OK to make the folder available to other computers on the 
network.
An upturned hand appears on the folder icon in File Manager, indicating that 
the folder is shared.

49

properties 
for sharing.
 
In the Permissions tab of the folder’s properties (right-click a folder a select 
Properties from the pop-up menu), you can password-protect the directory 
and make it read-only, so no one other than you can make changes to the 
contents.
To turn off sharing on a folder, select the folder and follow the same steps

Accessing shared Windows printers
If you’re sharing a printer on a Windows network, your Eee PC may be able to 
use it to print over the network.
 
Notice I said may be able to use it. A shared printer is no guarantee your Eee 
PC can print. It depends completely on the printer and whether it supports 
Linux. If a Linux driver is available, you should have no problems. If there’s no 
driver available, you are probably out of luck. I talk about printer issues like 
this and offer possible solutions in Chapter 9.
 
Before following the upcoming steps for accessing a shared printer, I recom-
mend you first check whether the printer is Linux compatible by visiting the 
Linux Foundation’s OpenPrinting Database at: http://openprinting.org/
printer_list.cgi
If the printer doesn’t look like it’s supported under Linux and you’re the 
patient type, you may still want to try to get it working. (I, personally, 
wouldn’t hold my breath.)

50
Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
If the shared Windows printer does get a Linux thumbs-up in the database, 
perform the following steps:
 
1. In the Linux desktop Settings tab, click Printers.
 
2. Click the Add button.
 
3. Select Network printer and click Next.
 
4. Select Windows as the network type.
 
5. Click the Browse button to select a shared Windows printer.
 
 Figure 3-10 shows a shared Windows printer being selected.
 
 Alternatively, you can skip browsing if you know the network path to the 
printer. In that case, just enter the full network path in the Path text box. 
For example, \\Wally\Multipass points to a shared printer named 
Multipass on a computer named Wally in a Windows network.
 
6. Select the printer manufacturer and model from the drop-down lists. 
The correct driver is selected for you.
 
 If your printer isn’t shown, try a similar model or Generic.
 
7. Optionally, print a test page and click Finish.
 
If you can’t get your printer to work, try not to get too obsessed. Life is too 
short, and it’s easy enough to transfer files on a USB thumb drive from your 
Eee PC to a computer with a working printer.

 Chapter 3: Getting Connected with the Eee PC
Changing your computer’s name
On a Windows network, your computer’s name appears as eeepc-something. 
The something is whatever you named the computer when you ran it for the 
first time (usually your name, if you followed the instructions).
If you want to change your computer’s name, here’s how:
 
1. Start a Linux console session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. Enter sudo kcontrol.
 
 This runs the KDE Control Center program where you can make various 
changes to the desktop environment.
 
3. Click the plus sign next to Network in the left window.
 
4. Click Network Connections.
 
5. In the Identification tab, enter the new name of the computer.
 
 Figure 3-11 shows the Identification tab.
 
6. Click Apply and exit the KDE Control Center.

Part I: Getting Started with the Eee PC 
Changing your workgroup name
By default, the Eee PC uses WORKGROUP as its Windows network workgroup 
name. This is the same default workgroup name that Windows uses when you 
create a network. If you didn’t change the network’s name, the Eee PC should 
happily connect to WORKGROUP.
If you did change the Windows network workgroup name to something other 
than WORKGROUP (such as HOME, MYNETWORK, and so on) and your Eee PC 
doesn’t display that workgroup in File Manager, here’s what you need to do:
 
1. Start a Linux console session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. Enter sudo kcontrol.
 
 This is the same KDE Control Center program we just used to change the 
computer’s name.
 
3. Click the plus sign next to Network in the left window.
 
4. Click Windows Networking.
 
 Windows Networking settings appear as shown in Figure 3-12.
 
5. Enter the name of your workgroup in all caps and click Apply.
With the workgroup name changed, you now should be able to connect to 
shared Windows network resources in that workgroup.

Part II
Day to Day with 
the Eee PC

In this part . . .
L
inux Eee PC models come bundled with a large, 
comprehensive collection of software. Essential 
Internet programs, work-related applications, games and 
entertainment programs, a variety of utilities, and even 
some educational packages for the kids, are all preinstalled. 
In this part, I describe the software that comes with Linux 
models (conveniently organized by the Internet, Work, 
Learn, Play, and Settings tabs in the user interface) and 
show you how to get started using it.
Microsoft Windows users shouldn’t feel left out because I 
also discuss the differences between Linux and Windows, 
provide instructions for installing your own copy of 
Windows on a Linux Eee PC, and tell you how to get the 
most out of models that come preinstalled with Windows.

Cruising the Internet
In This Chapter
▶ Browsing the Web with Firefox
▶ Accessing Web mail
▶ Making calls with Skype
▶ Instant messaging with Pidgin
▶ Using other Web services
▶ Reading e-books
I
n this chapter, I discuss the programs found on the Internet tab of the Eee 
PC, as shown in Figure 4-1. As you might have guessed, all the icons in this 
tab relate to the Internet in one way or another.
The Internet tab offers a Web browser, an instant messaging program, Skype, 
and other icons for accessing Web e-mail and other services. (ASUS also 
includes icons for a world clock and e-book reader that, although not directly 
related to the Net, are still useful.)
 
Keep in mind that not every icon represents a program. In a number of cases, 
icons are simply links to Web pages. Think of them as easy-to-find, preset 
bookmarks. For example when you click Internet Radio, a spiffy radio program 
doesn’t pop up as you might expect. Instead, a Web site with a list of radio 
shows is loaded (if you’re connected to the Internet, that is).
I cover the Network and Wireless Networks icons in Chapter 3. I assume you 
have an Internet connection, so let’s get started.
 
Basic instructions for all the programs that I describe in this chapter can be 
found in the Eee PC online help. On the Linux desktop, click the Help menu 
item and, when you are inside the Help file, click the Internet tab.

Browsing the Web
When you click the Web icon, the Eee PC loads the Firefox Web browser 
(shown in Figure 4-2). Firefox (www.mozilla.com/firefox) is a popular, 
free, open-source browser with versions that run in Linux, Windows, and 
Macintosh OS X.
901 Eee PC and Beyond
On 901 and later Eee PCs, you might find some 
additional icons in the desktop Internet tab. 
These include:
 ✓ Google Search — Displays the search page 
(www.google.com) in the browser.
 ✓ Google Maps — Displays the street map 
Web page (http://maps.google.
com).
 ✓ Video Search — Loads the YouTube 
video site (www.youtube.com) in the 
browser.
 ✓ YOStore — Runs a program for transfer-
ring files to and from your Eee PC via the 
Internet and an online storage site.
 ✓ EeeConnect — Runs a utility that allows Eee 
PCs to remotely connect over the Internet.
For more information on these icons and pro-
grams, refer to your user manual or consult the 
online help.

57
 Chapter 4: Cruising the Internet
 
Figure 4-2: 
Browsing 
the Web 
with Firefox.
 
 
If you’ve been using Windows and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, Firefox is very 
similar. A few interface differences are explained on the following site: www.
mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/switch.html.
Firefox features
Most browsers share basic functions and generally work the same way, but if 
you’ve never used Firefox before, I want to mention a few features that make 
it my preferred browser on the Eee PC (as well as other computers).
 
✓ Built-in spell checking — Words that aren’t in the browser’s spelling 
dictionary are underlined in red as you type. This is especially useful for 
composing Web e-mails.
 
✓ Enhanced security — Having done a lot of computer security work over 
the years, it’s my humble opinion that Firefox takes top honors when it 
comes to browser security. You’ll find phishing and spyware protection, 
easy private data clearing, and prompt update releases when security 
vulnerabilities are discovered.
 
✓ Multiple search integration — Type something in the toolbar and then 
select where you’d like to search — such as Google, Yahoo, Wikipedia, 
eBay, or any other.
 
✓ Pop-up blocking — Firefox can automatically block annoying (and some-
times malicious) pop-up windows.
 
✓ RSS reader — Get RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds such as blog 
entries, news headlines, and Web site updates from within the browser.

58
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
✓ Session restore — If your computer crashes while Firefox is running (or 
you shut it down), the browser remembers and loads all the Web sites 
you had open the next time it runs.
 
✓ Speed — Firefox is quick, even on the Eee PC with its small amount of 
memory and not exactly blazing-fast processor.
 
✓ Tabbed browsing — Firefox pioneered the use of tabs versus separate 
windows for browsing, and it has a number of different options for maxi-
mizing tabbed Web surfing.
 
While cruising the Net with your Eee PC, you might sometimes get a “Server 
Not Found” error after entering a Web site address. Carefully check the link 
you just typed. With the Eee PC’s small keyboard, it’s easy to accidentally 
enter a comma instead of a period in a Web address.
I could go on listing more features, but your best bet is to start using the 
browser and discover what it has to offer. If you do want to read more 
about browsing the Firefox way, visit the official Web site at: http://
support.mozilla.com or check out the forums at http://forums.
mozillazine.org.
 
Because of Eee PC’s small screen, you may frequently find yourself using the 
horizontal scrollbar to view content that appears off the screen. This is a Web 
site formatting issue. Some Web sites dynamically format content based on 
the PC’s screen size so you don’t have to scroll to the right. Other sites use 
fixed length lines of text, assuming the user will be viewing with a normal-sized 
monitor. There’s not much you can do in Firefox (or any other browser) to 
address this, aside from getting a larger screen Eee PC or connecting an exter-
nal monitor to your Eee PC.
What’s in a name?
Maybe you’ve noticed the name Mozilla and 
you’re wondering what it has to do with Firefox. 
Back in the early days of the Web, the first 
Web browser was called Mosaic. When Marc 
Andreesen, who co-founded Netscape, devel-
oped a browser to compete against Mosaic, it 
was internally dubbed Mozilla (a play on words 
with Mosaic and Godzilla, foretelling what was 
going to happen to the rival browser). Netscape 
was eventually acquired by AOL, and the Mozilla 
browser became an open-source project. Along 
the way some developers thought Mozilla was 
getting too bloated, and they decided to create 
a leaner, meaner version. That browser was 
first called Phoenix (as in rising from Mozilla’s 
ashes), but there were trademark issues with 
the name. Next it became Firebird, but there 
was already an open-source database with 
that name. The developers finally settled on 
Firefox (it was similar to Firebird, and they liked 
the sound of it) in 2004, and the name has stuck 
ever since.

59
 Chapter 4: Cruising the Internet
Installing and using Firefox add-ons
One of the advantages Firefox has over other browsers is the large number of 
add-on programs and themes people have written for it.
Add-ons come in three different types:
 
✓ Extensions — Small programs designed to extend the browser’s 
functionality.
 
✓ Languages — A feature that changes the language of the user interface.
 
✓ Themes — Code that alters the browser’s user interface.
Add-ons tend to be relatively small in size and don’t take up a lot of disk 
space — which is important when it comes to the Eee PC.
They are also very easy to install. The Firefox add-ons Web site (https://
addons.mozilla.org) contains descriptions, links, and reviews of over 
1,000 available add-ons. Installation, which I talk about in the next section, is 
a matter of clicking a few buttons.
Finally, add-ons are platform independent. That means if you run Firefox in 
Windows and have a favorite add-on, you can also use it with your Eee PC.
Installing an add-on
To download and install a Firefox add-on, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an add-on you want to install from the Firefox add-on site.
 
2. Click the Add to Firefox button.
 
 A software installation dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the Install Now button.
 
 A dialog box is displayed that provides status information about the 
download and install process. Wait until the install is successfully 
completed.
 
4. Click the Restart Firefox button.
 
 Firefox must restart before you can use the newly installed add-on.
After Firefox has restarted, the add-on is now available to use.
Running and setting preferences
Once you’ve got the add-on installed, it’s time to take it for a spin. To run an 
add-on or set its preferences, follow these steps:

60
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
1. From the Tools menu, select Add-ons.
 
 A dialog box is shown with the add-ons and themes that are currently 
installed in the browser.
 
2. You have two options at this point:
 
• By selecting an add-on extension, you can click the Preferences 
button to set preferences, the Disable or Enable button to control 
whether the add-on is running, or the Uninstall button to remove it.
 
• By selecting a theme, you can choose to use that theme or unin-
stall it. When you change themes, you restart Firefox for the theme 
to take effect.
For setting preferences and issuing commands, depending on the add-on, you 
might see an icon placed on the toolbar or a menu item added to the Tools 
menu.
To get you started with add-ons, here are a few of my favorites that you may 
want to try:
 
✓ Adblock Plus — Blocks Web site advertisements, which is espe-
cially useful for the Eee PC with its small screen: https://addons.
mozilla.org/firefox/addon/1865.
 
✓ Forecastfox — A slick little weather add-on that gets forecasts from 
Accuweather.com and displays them in the status bar: https://
addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/398.
 
✓ NoScript — If you’re concerned about Java and JavaScript security, use 
this add-on to execute scripts from only the sites you trust: https://
addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722.
 
✓ Video DownloadHelper — Saves YouTube and other online videos 
to your drive: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/3006.
Have fun with add-ons. With the large number of available titles, you can 
spend hours browsing through the add-on database, reading reviews and 
descriptions, and downloading different versions.
 
If you’ve installed an add-on and no longer use it, be sure to uninstall it to save 
space. Owning an Eee PC means paying attention to drive space.
 
Add-ons take up memory and processor cycles, so if you go crazy installing 
a lot of them, Firefox’s performance will begin to suffer. If this happens, just 
start removing add-ons as I described in the preceding section.

61
 Chapter 4: Cruising the Internet
Maximizing screen space for the Eee PC
Although screen space is at a premium on the Eee PC, you can maximize the 
viewing area in Foxfire in several ways. Try some of the following:
 
✓ Hide the Eee PC taskbar — Click the arrow on the far-right side of the 
desktop taskbar to hide it. (Clicking the arrow again shows the taskbar.)
 
✓ Hide Firefox toolbars — In Firefox’s View menu, select Toolbars. Then 
uncheck Navigation Toolbar and Bookmarks Toolbar.
 
✓ Hide the Firefox status bar — In the View menu, uncheck Status Bar.
 
✓ Use a Firefox add-on — Several add-on themes can help you maximize 
screen space. They include
 
• miniFox — Maximizes space between interface elements: 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/607.
 
• Tiny Menu — Replaces the default menu with a reduced size 
version: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/1455.
 
• Compact Menu — Provides several ways of compressing the 
menu: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/4550.
 
• Full Fullscreen — Starts up Firefox in full-screen mode, and hides 
the toolbars: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/
firefox/addon/1568.
 
There are other add-on themes for small laptop screens besides the ones I just 
mentioned. Visit the Firefox add-ons site (https://addons.mozilla.org/
firefox/) and do a search for compact.
Accessing Your Web Mail
I’m a big fan of using Web mail accounts on the Eee PC. They’re convenient, 
you don’t need to worry about running out of disk space on the Eee PC’s 
small drive, and you don’t have e-mails scattered between your primary com-
puter and the mini-laptop.

62
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
Figure 4-3: 
Web mail 
options.
 
When you click the Web Mail icon, it opens a new window with four icons (as 
shown in Figure 4-3). The icons are links to popular Web mail services, and 
include
 
✓ Gmail — Google’s e-mail service
 
✓ Hotmail — Microsoft’s e-mail service
 
✓ Yahoo — Yahoo’s e-mail service
 
✓ AOL — America Online’s e-mail service
When you click an icon, the Web browser loads the e-mail service you selected. 
(If Firefox is already running, the Web mail service is loaded into a new tab.)
If you don’t have a free account with one of these services, you can create 
one on the login Web page that is displayed.
 
For a great comparison of features that the different Web e-mail services offer, 
visit: http://blogs.swebee.com/e-mail-service/free-webmail-
services-comparison/2008-05-01_69-1.html.
When the browser is running, you can click the Home icon in the taskbar to 
return to the desktop. To return the Internet tab, click the arrow above the 
Web mail icons.
 
For some reason ASUS decided to put the e-mail client icon in the Work tab 
instead of the Internet tab. I discuss Thunderbird, the preinstalled e-mail 
client, in Chapter 6.

63
 Chapter 4: Cruising the Internet
Making Calls with Skype
If you’ve never heard of Skype, it’s a program and service that allows you to 
make free-of-charge telephone calls to other Skype users over the Internet 
(the technical term for this is Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP). With a 
subscription fee, you can also make phone calls to cell phones and landlines 
(cutting down on your long distance bills). In addition to phone calls, Skype 
supports instant messaging features and file transfer.
After you have an Internet connection, plug a speaker/microphone headset into 
your Eee PC, click the Skype icon, log in, and you’re ready to use the program.
Skype is very popular. (At the beginning of 2008, over 300 million accounts were 
in use with the service.) Free versions of the program are available for Linux, 
Windows, and Mac OS X; these all have the same basic features and work simi-
larly. (Setting Skype preferences on the Eee PC is shown in Figure 4-4).
If you’ve used Skype on a PC or laptop before, you’ll find it functions the 
same way when you run it on an Eee PC — with two exceptions:
 
✓ When you run Skype, it adds an icon to the Linux desktop taskbar. Right-
click the icon to display a pop-up menu with program commands.
 
✓ When the Eee PC was first released, it shipped with a version of Skype 
that didn’t support videoconferencing (Web cam support for the Linux 
version was in beta test at the time). If you’re using a version of Skype 
that’s less than 2.0, you can download a newer version that supports 
Web cams. I discuss how to download software updates in Chapter 12.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Setting 
Skype 
preferences.
 

64
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
If you haven’t used Skype and want to give it a try, you need to sign up for a 
free account (there is a link for creating one when you run the program).
Before doing that, I suggest you visit the Skype Web site at www.skype.com 
to learn more about the service.
 
To get help on using Skype, check out the Skype Community site at http://
forum.skype.com/.
Instant Messaging
If you want to use your Eee PC for instant messaging (IM), click the 
Messenger icon on the Internet tab. This runs a popular open-source IM 
client named Pidgin (in the old days, the program was known as GAIM). 
Pidgin works with most popular instant messaging networks including AIM, 
Google Talk, ICQ, IRC, MSN, MySpaceIM, Yahoo!, and others.
The first time you run Pidgin, you’re asked to add account information for 
any IM accounts you already have (as shown in Figure 4-5).
Adding an existing account is simple. You specify an IM service from a drop-
down list box and provide your user ID, password, and nickname.
 
Figure 4-5: 
Setting up 
Pidgin for 
instant 
messaging.
 

65
 Chapter 4: Cruising the Internet
After you’ve successfully logged onto an IM network (remember, you need 
an Internet connection), your Buddy List (personal instant messaging phone-
book) appears, and you’re ready to start chatting.
 
Pidgin supports simultaneously logging into multiple IM networks. That means 
you can be talking with buddies on AIM and Yahoo at the same time. This is a 
great feature if you have multiple personalities.
Pidgin has most of the same features as other IM clients, such as file trans-
fers, away messages, and notifications, as well as an extensive collection of 
add-on programs that extend its functionality.
 
Pidgin adds an icon to the Eee PC’s taskbar. Right-click the icon to display a 
pop-up menu with commands.
You can learn more about Pidgin by selecting Online Help in the program’s 
Help menu. Or, you can visit the Pidgin project Web site at: www.pidgin.im.
Getting the Facts with Wikipedia
When you click the Wikipedia icon, the Web browser opens and loads the 
Wikipedia home page (http://wikipedia.org/). If the browser is already 
running, Wikipedia opens in a new tab.
If you’ve never used Wiki before (most users drop the –pedia when they refer 
to it), the Web site is a multilingual, free encyclopedia. The Wiki home page is 
shown in Figure 4-6. Select which language version of the encyclopedia you’d 
like to view to get started.
Making the connection
If you don’t have an instant messaging account, 
here are some Web links to Pidgin-compatible 
services where you can register for one:
 ✓ AIM: www.aim.com
 ✓ Google: http://mail.google.com/
mail/signup
 ✓ ICQ: http://web.icq.com/
register
 ✓ MSN (if you have Hotmail email): http://
registernet.passport.com/
 ✓ MSN (to use a non-Hotmail email address): 
http://register.passport.
net/
 ✓ Yahoo: http://edit.yahoo.com/
config/eval_register
Fill in the requested information to create a free 
account, which you can then add to Pidgin.

66
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
Figure 4-6: 
Wikipedia’s 
home page.
 
What makes Wiki unique is that all the content (including text and images) 
has been added to the site by its users. People from all over the world con-
tribute information about topics they know (and/or are passionate about). 
Other users have the ability to add to the content or edit it to enhance accu-
racy and increase comprehensiveness.
 
User-created and -edited content has generated controversy for Wiki over the 
years, especially as there have been cases where incorrect information was 
purposely submitted. Despite this, Wiki still remains an excellent general, one-
stop-shopping, information resource for a wide variety of subjects. However, if 
you are researching something of importance, always check multiple sources. 
Don’t put all your eggs in the Wiki basket.
After you get inside Wiki, on the right side of the page is a search text box. 
Type in whatever you are interested in looking for and click the Go button. 
Wiki searches its database and displays a matching article. (If there are mul-
tiple articles, you can select the one that most closely matches what you are 
seeking.)
Wiki is easy to use and has online help to assist you with searching and using 
the encyclopedia.
Using Google Docs
Clicking the Google Docs icon loads the Google Docs (http://docs.
google.com) Web site into the Eee PC’s Firefox browser.

67
 Chapter 4: Cruising the Internet
Google Docs is a free, online suite of office programs, including a word pro-
cessor, spreadsheet, and presentation application. Instead of the conven-
tional approach of using standalone programs installed on your PC, Google 
Docs lets you create, edit, and store documents online, using a Web browser 
and an Internet connection. The Google Docs interface is shown in Figure 4-7.
 
You need a free Google account to use Google Docs. Either sign in with your 
existing account information or create a new account.
Some of Google Docs’ features include
 
✓ A simple, easy-to-use interface
 
✓ The capability to save documents in PDF and other common formats
 
✓ The capability to import Microsoft Office and OpenOffice (which is 
preinstalled on the Linux Eee PC and which I talk about in Chapter 5) 
documents
 
✓ Collaboration options that allow documents to be shared, opened, and 
edited by multiple users at the same time
 
✓ The capability to publish documents as Web pages
 
New features are regularly added to Google Docs. To keep up with the latest, 
check out the Google Docs development team’s blog at: http://google

Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Being able to store your documents online and work on them from anywhere 
there’s an Internet connection is pretty appealing. However, before you start 
relying completely on Google Docs, you should be aware of a few limitations.
 
✓ Internet connection required — It goes without saying, “No Net, no 
access to documents.” Google Docs does, however, allow you to save 
documents to your own drive.
 
✓ Basic features — The word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation 
programs have basic features. If you need advanced functions and fea-
tures, you should turn to a conventional office program.
 
✓ Document size and total storage space — There are limitations on how 
large a single document can be as well as the total number of documents 
that can be stored online.
 
✓ Theoretical security issues — There are some theoretical security and 
privacy issues with using Google Docs. Not to be overly paranoid, but I 
wouldn’t use it to work on a document that contains sensitive information.
I’ve just scratched the surface on Google Docs, and there’s a lot more to 
learn, so pay a visit to http://documents.google.com/support/.
Custom Start Pages with iGoogle
Clicking the iGoogle icon on the Internet tab takes you to Google’s service 
for creating a customizable start page (www.google.com/ig, as shown in 
Figure 4-8).
iGoogle allows you to easily build your own personalized home or start page. 
You have a choice of a number of different themes as well as gadgets that dis-
play RSS feeds, weather, YouTube videos, and more. If you use other Google 
services such as Gmail, Google Docs, or Google Calendar, the page provides a 
quick, centralized way to access them.
 
You need a Google account to set up an iGoogle page. Either sign in with your 
account information or create a new account.
After you’ve created an iGoogle page, you can set it as your Firefox home 
page, so the page is displayed when you start the browser. With the iGoogle 
page displayed follow these steps:
 
1. In the Firefox Edit menu, select Preferences.
 
2. Click the Main tab and set the iGoogle page as your home page with 
the Use Current Page button.
 
3. Click Close.

Listening to Internet Radio
When you click the Internet Radio icon, your Web browser goes to the 
mediaU home page (www.mediayou.net), as shown in Figure 4-9. This is a 
Taiwanese site that allows you to use your browser to listen to music and 
radio programs from all over the world. The interface is a bit busy, but it 
gives you some decent media selections.
 
If you’re learning a foreign language, international Internet radio stations are a 
great resource for practicing your listening skills.
Listen to the music
Lots of other Web sites provide free Internet 
radio or directories of online stations. Some 
popular radio sites to consider dialing in on your 
Eee PC include:
 ✓ Live365: www.live365.com
 ✓ Radio Tower: www.radiotower.com
 ✓ SHOUTCast: www.shoutcast.com

Keeping Track of World Time
Clicking on the World Clock icon displays a nifty map of the globe, showing 
where it’s day and where it’s night (as seen in Figure 4-10). You’ll have to 
ask ASUS what this program has to do with the Internet, because I sure don’t 
know. Maybe because the Internet spans the globe? But I digress, so back to 
the clock.

 Chapter 4: Cruising the Internet
 
In Eee PC 901 and later models, the World Clock appears in the desktop 
Work tab.
Move the cursor anywhere on the map to display time zone information, 
including nearby cities and the current date and time.
If you right-click the map, a pop-up menu is displayed that allows you to 
change program settings. Options include the following:
 
✓ Flags — You can select different color flags and place them on the map.
 
✓ Clocks — This command lets you add clocks below the map that show 
the current time in a selected time zone. Right-click a clock to remove it.
 
✓ Map Theme — This command displays a flat or physical relief map.
 
✓ Show Daylight — This command toggles day and night display on and off.
 
✓ Show Cities — This option controls whether time zone information is 
shown when you move the cursor on the map.
 
✓ Show Flags — This command displays or hides flags.
 
✓ Save Settings — This command saves any changed settings.
 
To learn more about using the World Clock, check out the KDE World Clock 
documentation at http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdetoys/kworld
clock/index.html.
Reading e-Books
The Eee PC comes with an e-book (electronic book) reader called FBReader 
(as shown in Figure 4-11). Click the e-Book icon to run the program.
 
In case you don’t see it, the e-book reader icon has a habit of disappearing 
on some Eee PCs. (I discuss disappearing desktop icons and remedies in 
Chapter 22.)
Whether the icon is present or not, the open-source FBReader is still there, 
allowing you to read your favorite e-books on your Eee PC. Some of its fea-
tures include
 
✓ Support for multiple e-book formats, including
 
• HTML (Web page formatting)
 
• CHM (Microsoft Compiled HTML; frequently used for Windows 
help files and technical e-books)

72
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
• RTF (Rich Text Format)
 
• Plain text
 
• Other common formats, including plucker, PalmDoc, and ZTxt
 
 FBReader doesn’t support Digital Rights Management (DRM) formatted 
books (e-books you purchase that have some form of copy protection). 
Also, to read an e-book saved in the PDF format, use the PDF Reader in 
the Eee PC’s desktop Work tab.
 
✓ Rotating text so the Eee PC can be held like an open book
 
✓ Selectable fonts and sizes
 
✓ Searchable text
 
✓ Keyboard and button navigation
 
In 901 and later Eee PC models, ASUS also includes an e-Book program called 
MeReader. Run the program by clicking the Mebook icon in the Eee PC’s desk-
top Learn tab.
 
Figure 4-11: 
FBReader 
in action.
 

73
 Chapter 4: Cruising the Internet
Using the eBook icon
When you click the eBook icon, it runs the File Manager (which I discuss in 
Chapter 6) and displays the contents of My EBooks in the My Documents 
folder directory. The idea is for you to store all your ebooks in this directory; 
whether you do is completely up to you.
When you’re in the File Manager, follow these steps:
 
✓ Double-click an e-book to display it. For example, in the My EBooks 
folder there is a file named manual.chm (which happens to be an Eee PC 
user manual for all the installed Linux programs). FBReader displays the 
user manual when you double-click the file.
 
✓ Use the File Manager Open with command. Select the e-book file you’d 
like to read, right-click it, and then choose E-book reader from the Open 
With… menu item.
When there’s no eBook icon
If there’s no eBook icon, you can always use the File Manager to open an 
e-book by double-clicking on the e-book’s file icon. But there’s also an 
advanced method to run FBReader:
 
1. Press Ctl+Alt+T.
 
 This brings up a Linux command-line console window. I tell you much 
more about this in Chapter 20.
 
2. Type FBReader.
 
 Make sure to capitalize exactly as you see it here, and then press the 
Enter key after you’re done.
This runs the FBReader program. Congratulations! You just successfully used 
command-line Linux. If you know the names of other programs, you can use 
these same steps to run them, too. Because you’re done with the console, 
you can close its window to tidy up.
To learn more about FBReader, visit the project’s Web site at www.
fbreader.org.

Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
No library card needed
If you want to use your Eee PC as a portable 
library, here are a few of my favorite links 
to Web sites where you can download free 
e-books to view with FBReader.
 ✓ Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.
org/wiki/Main_Page) — The grand-
daddy of free book sites includes thousands 
of titles, including many classics.
 ✓ MemoWare (www.memoware.com) — 
Originally started for PDAs (Palms and 
Pocket PCs), but now equally applicable for 
mini-laptops.
 ✓ Many Books (http://manybooks.
net) — Books from the Gutenberg collec-
tion and others, but in more formats.
 ✓ University of Virginia Electronic Text 
Center (h t t p : / / e t e x t . l i b .
virginia.edu/ebooks) — The 
University of Virginia Library houses an 
extensive collection of fiction, literature, 
history, and children’s books.
 ✓ Munsey’s (www.munseys.com/) — A 
great collection of old, pulp-fiction novels 
(adult themes and racy covers, so for 
mature audiences only please).
There are lots of other sites with free e-books. 
If you exhaust these sources, Google is your 
friend.

Getting Down to Work I: 
OpenOffice
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing OpenOffice
▶ Word processing with Writer
▶ Spreadsheets with Calc
▶ Presentations with Impress
▶ Databases with Base
▶ Graphics with Draw
C
onsidering its small size, the Eee PC is a surprising little workhorse. The 
Linux version of the mini-laptop comes preinstalled with virtually every-
thing you need for word processing, spreadsheet calculations, creating and 
giving presentations, and performing other work-related activities. All these 
programs are conveniently located in the Linux desktop’s Work tab.
There are lots of programs in the Work tab, so I use two chapters to tell you 
all about them. In this chapter, I discuss the Documents, Spreadsheets, and 
Presentations programs, which are actually part of a nifty, free, open-source 
application suite similar to Microsoft Office called OpenOffice. I continue get-
ting down to work in Chapter 6, presenting the remaining programs found in 
the Work tab.
Before I get started, keep in mind that I only have a limited amount of space 
to give you a general overview of OpenOffice and its features. But don’t fear. I 
list lots of Internet resources for you to find out more about using and getting 
the most from the application suite.
 
Basic instructions for all of the programs I describe in this chapter can be 
found in the Eee PC online help. On the desktop, click the Help menu item and 
then, at the top of the help page, select the Work tab.

76
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
Some Linux Eee PC models come installed with StarOffice, a variation of 
OpenOffice. The programs and commands are generally the same, and aside 
from some minor differences in dialog boxes and other user interface ele-
ments, everything I discuss in this chapter applies to both office suites.
Opening Up OpenOffice
OpenOffice is an office application suite of programs. Think of it as a free, 
open-source Microsoft Office alternative (with a few more features, actually).
 
Just so you know, the trademark to the OpenOffice name is held by someone 
other than the OpenOffice, open-source project. To resolve this sticky legal 
situation, the project trademarked the name OpenOffice.org (abbreviated 
OOo); which is now the official name for the program suite. Everyone still 
seems to call it OpenOffice though, so whenever you see OpenOffice in the 
upcoming pages, I’m really talking about OpenOffice.org. And that statement 
should keep all the lawyers in the house happy, I hope.
OpenOffice started life in the late 1990s as StarOffice, a commercial office appli-
cation suite. Sun Microsystems (which was in a pitched battle with Microsoft 
at the time) purchased the software from a German company and then made it 
available for free. In 2000, Sun released the source code and OpenOffice became 
an open-source project. Over the years it has evolved from a slightly clunky col-
lection of programs to a full-featured, viable alternative to Microsoft Office.
 
StarOffice, which comes preinstalled with Windows XP Eee PCs and some 
Linux models, has most of the same programs and interfaces as OpenOffice.
Getting back to the Linux Eee PC again, it has three icons in the Work tab (as 
shown in Figure 5-1) for running OpenOffice programs. They include
 
✓ Documents — OpenOffice Writer: A word processor that has a similar 
set of features (and a similar look and feel) as Microsoft Word.
 
✓ Spreadsheets — OpenOffice Calc: A spreadsheet program similar to 
Microsoft Excel.
 
✓ Presentations — OpenOffice Impress: A presentation program similar to 
Microsoft PowerPoint.
In addition to these programs, OpenOffice also includes
 
✓ OpenOffice Draw — A vector graphics program with features compa-
rable to early versions of CorelDRAW.
 
✓ OpenOffice Base — A database application similar to Microsoft Access.
 
✓ OpenOffice Math — A utility for creating and editing mathematical equa-
tions (similar to Microsoft Equation Editor if you’re a math/science type).

77
 Chapter 5: Getting Down to Work I: OpenOffice
 
Figure 5-1: 
The 
OpenOffice 
icons in the 
Work tab.
 
Depending on the Eee PC model, Draw and Math might not have icons in the 
Work tab. However, you can access them, and Base, from the other three 
OpenOffice programs (I show you how coming up).
Now I don’t want you to think I’m one of those pushy, high-pressure open-
source salesmen. I’m not going to say you should get rid of all your Microsoft 
software and only use Linux and open-source programs. That choice is up 
to you.
What I do want to sell you on is this. For the most part OpenOffice is com-
patible with Microsoft Office format files. That means you can copy a Word 
file from your PC onto a USB thumb drive, plug it into the Eee PC, and work 
on the document with OpenOffice. And when you get back to your main PC, 
Word will happily read all the edits you made on your Eee PC.
 
You will likely run into compatibility troubles if your Microsoft Office docu-
ments have complex graphics, fancy fonts and formatting, nested tables, com-
plicated macros, and embedded OLE objects. Also, new Microsoft Office file 
formats such as DOCX and XLSX are not supported. (There are conversion utili-
ties so you can use these files, and they will be supported in OpenOffice 3.0.)
 
And speaking of file types, OpenOffice programs can save files in Adobe 
Acrobat PDF format so there’s no need for commercial or free conversion 
applications. Now that’s what I call a feature.
Versions of OpenOffice are available for Linux (obviously), Windows, and 
Mac. To learn more about OpenOffice or to download a version for your pri-
mary computer (hint, hint) visit: www.openoffice.org.

78
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
If you want to give OpenOffice a try in Windows without installing it on your 
hard drive, check out this portable version: http://portableapps.com/
apps/office/openoffice_portable. It runs on a USB thumb drive or SD 
card with about 250 MB of free space available. After you’ve installed it, just 
plug in the drive or card and run OpenOffice on any Windows PC.
Shared OpenOffice Commands
Before I talk about the OpenOffice suite of programs, I want to give you a 
quick overview of how to perform some common tasks. The OpenOffice 
applications conveniently share ways of doing certain things (such as open-
ing and saving documents). For example, you use the same steps to create a 
new document in Writer as you would in Calc.
But before we get to those steps, here’s the scoop on OpenOffice’s extensive 
online help system. It’s indispensable for learning how to use and take advan-
tage of all the suite’s features (although OpenOffice is similar to Microsoft 
Office, the menus, commands and dialog boxes are somewhat different). 
If you’ve never used OpenOffice before, I suggest you get started with the 
following.
Getting help
Two types of help are available inside OpenOffice programs, What’s This? and 
a traditional online help system. Here are the basics for using both.
What’s This?
What’s This? provides summarized information about the command icons 
and other OpenOffice elements you see on the screen. To use the What’s 
This? Feature, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Help menu, select What’s This?
 
 The cursor turns into a question mark.
 
2. Move the cursor over toolbar items and buttons to learn more 
about them.
 
 A pop-up box provides information about the command (as shown in 
Figure 5-2).
Click the mouse (the cursor can be anywhere on the screen) to turn off help 
and return the cursor to normal.

79
 Chapter 5: Getting Down to Work I: OpenOffice

The What’s 
This? pop-
up box.
 
Online Help
OpenOffice programs also feature a built-in online help system. To view the 
online help, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Help menu, select OpenOffice.org Help.
 
 The help system is loaded as shown in Figure 5-3. You can also press F1.
 
Figure 5-3: 
OpenOffice 
online help.
 

80
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
2. Use the left pane to select what information you want to view.
 
 The right window pane is where detailed help content is shown.
There are four, tabbed options at the top of the left pane for displaying 
information:
 
✓ Contents — This tab shows a table of contents with available help 
topics. Double-click a book icon to expand it. Double-clicking a question 
mark icon displays help for that particular topic in the right window 
pane.
 
✓ Index — An alphabetical list of subjects. Double-click a subject to dis-
play information about it.
 
✓ Find — This tab allows you to search for words in the help database. 
Enter a word and click Find. Matches are shown, and you can double-
click each one to display the associated help information.
 
✓ Bookmarks — You can assign bookmarks to help topics by clicking the 
star icon in the toolbar. Bookmarks are displayed in this tab.
 
The drop-down list box above the tabs allows you to display help for other 
OpenOffice programs.
Internet help resources
If you can’t find an answer to your question in OpenOffice’s online help, then 
consult these indispensable Internet resources
 
✓ OpenOffice main support page — http://support.openoffice.org/
 
✓ OpenOffice Wiki — http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/
wiki/Main_Page
 
✓ OpenOffice User Guides: Authors documentation project — http://
documentation.openoffice.org/manuals/oooauthors2/index.
html
 
✓ Tutorials for OpenOffice — www.tutorialsforopenoffice.org

Creating a new document
By default, when you run an OpenOffice program it starts with an empty 
document that you can immediately start working on.

81
 Chapter 5: Getting Down to Work I: OpenOffice
If you’re editing a file you’ve previously saved and want to create a new docu-
ment, simply select New from the File menu. However, because OpenOffice is 
an integrated program suite, when you create a new document, you first need 
to specify the type (as shown in Figure 5-4).
This means if you are in a Calc spreadsheet and you decide you need a new 
word-processing document, you don’t need to go back to the desktop and 
click the Documents icon. In Calc’s File menu, just select the file type in the 
New menu item.
The following file types are available:
 
✓ Text document — A word processing file.
 
✓ Spreadsheet — A spreadsheet document.
 
✓ Presentation — A PowerPoint-like presentation document.
 
✓ Drawing — A graphics file.
 
✓ Database — A database file.
 
✓ HTML Document — A Web page (Writer also serves as an HTML editor).
 
✓ XML Form Document — An Xform document (Web page that contains 
forms).
 
Figure 5-4: 
Select from 
different 
types
 of new 
documents.
 

82
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
✓ Master Document — An index file for organizing other documents (for 
example a Master Document could contain chapters, an index, and a 
table of contents for a book).
 
✓ Formula — A mathematical equation (you can format the equation with 
math symbols).
 
✓ Labels — Labels for printing.
 
✓ Business Cards — You guessed it, business cards.
 
✓ Templates and Documents — A collection of templates (resumes, 
letters, and so on).
The OpenOffice program associated with a file type runs (if it’s not already 
running), and a new window is opened. You can now start working on the 
document.
 
If you’re new to OpenOffice, experiment by opening different file types to see 
what happens. You won’t break anything, trust me.
Saving a document
After you’ve worked on a document, you undoubtedly want to save it.
With a new document, use the Save or Save As command in the File menu. A 
Save As dialog box appears as shown in Figure 5-5.
If you are editing a document you previously created (either with an 
OpenOffice or Microsoft Office program), use the Save command in the File 
menu. The format the file was originally saved in is retained. Use the Save As 
command in the File menu to save the file in a different format or give the file 
a new name.
 
By default, all OpenOffice documents are saved to the /My Documents/My 
Office directory. However, you can save the file anywhere you like.
You can specify the file format of a document with the Filter drop-down 
list box in the Save As dialog box. If you plan to edit the document with a 
Microsoft Office program, be sure to select a compatible file type, such as 
.doc, .xls, or .ppt.
To save a file to a USB thumb drive you have plugged into your Eee PC, follow 
these steps:
 
1. In the File menu, select Save As.
 
2. Click the My Eee PC icon.
 
 The My Eee PC icon has a penguin, whose name is Tux by the way.

83
 Chapter 5: Getting Down to Work I: OpenOffice
 
Figure 5-5: 
The 
OpenOffice 
Save As 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Double-click All File Systems.
 
4. Double-click the name of the USB drive.
 
 It should look something like this: /media/Cruzer Mini/partition1 or 
/media/D:.
 
5. Type a name for your file and click OK.
 
Instead of associating letters with mounted volumes as you do in Windows 
(for example D:), older Eee PC models use a Linux file system convention with 
volume names and partition numbers (such as /Cruzer/partition1). Newer Eee 
PC models incorporate the more user-friendly letters (such as D:).
Opening a document
To open a previously saved document (either created with OpenOffice or a 
compatible Microsoft Office program), do the following:
 
1. In the File menu, select Open.
 
 An example Open dialog box is shown in Figure 5-6.
 
2. Navigate through directories, select a file, and click OK.
 
 By default, the /My Documents/My Office directory is opened first.
 
You can open all compatible OpenOffice documents. For example if you are in 
Writer, you can select a spreadsheet and Calc runs and loads the file.

84

Opening a document on a USB drive
To open a document that is on a USB thumb drive you have plugged into 
your Eee PC, follow these steps:
 
1. In the File menu, select Open.
 
2. Click the My Eee PC icon.
 
3. Double-click All File Systems.
 
4. Double-click the name of the USB drive.
 
 It will look something like this: /media/Cruzer Mini/partition1 or 
/media/D:.
 
5. Select the file you want to open and click OK.
 
Open documents appear on the Linux desktop taskbar. If you have multiple 
documents open, click a document in the taskbar to bring it to the front.
Writing and Editing
Writer is similar to Microsoft Word. Run the program by clicking the 
Documents icon in the Work tab.

85
 Chapter 5: Getting Down to Work I: OpenOffice
 
Figure 5-7: 
The 
OpenOffice 
Writer word 
processor.
 
You’ll find that using OpenOffice Writer (shown in Figure 5-7) is pretty much like 
working with any other word processor. It’s a snap to create new documents 
as well as edit existing ones (remember, OpenOffice is compatible with most 
Microsoft Word formatted files). The Eee PC in combination with Writer is ideal 
for taking notes and editing documents on the road.
 
The tiny screen on the Eee PC can be challenging for older eyes; especially 
when doing a lot of writing. Here’s a tip that will help. In the View menu, select 
Zoom. You can zoom to 130% and see the entire page without needing to hori-
zontally scroll (after you center the scrollbar). The larger page size is a bless-
ing for the eyes.
To learn more about how to use Writer’s features, check out the OpenOffice 
Writer FAQ at http://documentation.openoffice.org/faqs/word_
processing/index.html.
Installing a dictionary
Because the Eee PC is sold all over the world, a spelling dictionary doesn’t 
come installed with OpenOffice. (You’d run out of drive space pretty quick if 
you included all the available language dictionaries.)
 
The Dictionary icon found in the desktop Work tab is a separate program that 
doesn’t work with OpenOffice. I discuss this dictionary in Chapter 6.
However it’s easy to install an English or other language dictionary, as well as 
thesaurus and hyphenation files. Here’s how:

86
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
1. In the File menu, select Wizards➪Install new dictionaries….
 
2. The DicOOo window is shown. Click the English link.
 
3. Click the Start DicOOo button and then follow the steps in the Wizard 
dialog box.
 
 You are prompted to retrieve dictionary, hyphenation, and thesaurus 
files. Specify English (United States) for each.
 
4. After the files have successfully downloaded, quit and then restart 
OpenOffice Writer.
 
5. In the Tools menu, choose Options➪Language Settings➪Writing Aids
 
6. Check each of the Available language modules.
 
7. Click OK.
You can now spell check your documents. You can also use these same steps 
to add other language dictionaries to OpenOffice.
Using the standard OpenOffice toolbar
If you’re getting to know OpenOffice using some of the Internet resources I 
previously mentioned, you may find that some tutorials refer to icons and 
commands that don’t appear in the toolbar. Here’s why.
The version of Writer that comes with the Eee PC doesn’t display the default, 
standard OpenOffice toolbar that many tutorials reference. Instead, ASUS 
uses a simplified toolbar named eeePC that contains a limited number of 
command icons.
To display Writer’s default toolbar, follow these steps:
 
1. In the View menu, select Toolbars.
 
2. Uncheck eeePC.
 
3. Check Standard.
The Standard toolbar, with a full collection of tools, is now shown.
Spreadsheet Calculations
Calc is the OpenOffice cousin of Microsoft Excel. Run the program by clicking 
on the Spreadsheets icon in the Work tab. You find an example spreadsheet, 
showing the interface, in Figure 5-8.

87
 Chapter 5: Getting Down to Work I: OpenOffice
 
Figure 5-8: 
Keep track 
of your 
spread-
sheets with 
OpenOffice 
Calc.
 
If you’ve used Excel before, aside from a few differences in the user interface, 
you should have no trouble working with Calc. Calc is compatible with .XLS 
files, and unless your spreadsheet has some advanced calculations, macros 
or Visual Basic scripts, you should be able to open and edit files you’ve cre-
ated on your primary desktop or laptop PC.
 
To read the FAQ for OpenOffice Calc, go to http://documentation.
openoffice.org/faqs/spreadsheet/index.html.
Making Presentations
Impress is the OpenOffice equivalent of Microsoft PowerPoint. Click the 
Presentations icon in the Work tab to run the program. An example presenta-
tion, showing the Impress interface, is shown in Figure 5-9.
Presentations are one of the areas where the Eee PC really shines. With its 
small size and VGA port, the Eee PC is the ultimate portable presentation 
machine. (I discuss changing desktop settings for presentations in Chapter 
9.) Even when not connected to a projector, the Eee PC is still great for 
making up-close presentations for one or two people sitting around the 
mini-laptop. 

88
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
Figure 5-9: 
Create 
presenta-
tions with 
OpenOffice 
Impress.
 
Impress enables you to load, edit and run PowerPoint presentations (basic 
ones, that is — complex presentations with sound, animation and other mul-
timedia elements can be problematic). You can also create presentations 
with Impress and save them in a number of different formats — including 
Flash, which makes it easy to add a presentation to a Web page.
While you can create presentations with Impress on your Eee PC, it’s much 
easier to build a presentation on your primary desktop or laptop using 
PowerPoint (or Impress), copy the file to a USB thumb drive or SD card, and 
then move the presentation to the Eee PC for display. A larger screen makes 
a big difference when creating and formatting a presentation.
 
It takes a while for Impress to load a PowerPoint format presentation. To 
speed things, after the presentation is loaded, save it as an OpenDocument 
Presentation (ODP) file. This is Impress’ internal file format which makes load-
ing and editing quicker. PowerPoint isn’t compatible with ODP files, so you 
need to save the presentation as a PPT file before transferring it back to your 
primary PC.
 
Sometimes when you open a PowerPoint presentation in Impress, the transi-
tions don’t work correctly. Here’s a link to a tutorial that shows you how to fix 
the problem: www.tutorialsforopenoffice.org/tutorial/Convert_
PowerPoint_To_Impress_Presentation.html.
I suggest visiting the official Impress FAQ to learn more about the program’s 
features and how to use it: http://documentation.openoffice.org/
faqs/word_processing/index.html.

89
 Chapter 5: Getting Down to Work I: OpenOffice
Working with Databases
Base is similar to Microsoft’s Access database. Although there isn’t an Eee PC 
desktop icon for the application, you can run the program by opening Writer, 
Calc or Impress, selecting New from the File menu, and specifying a database 
file. A wizard guides you through the initial steps of creating a new database 
or you can open an existing one.
OpenOffice Base is SQL-compatible and like other databases has easy-to-use 
tools for creating Tables, Queries, Forms, and Reports (the form design tool 
is shown in Figure 5-10).
 
You might find the Eee PC’s small screen a challenge when creating databases. 
If you need a database, I recommend building at least the forms interface with 
OpenOffice on your primary PC and then copying it to the Eee PC’s drive or 
loading the database file from a USB thumb drive. If you need a simple, list-
oriented database, consider using Calc instead of Base.
Unlike other OpenOffice applications that are compatible with their Microsoft 
counterparts, you cannot directly open Access .MDB files.
To read more about Base’s features, point your browser to the OpenOffice 
wiki at http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Database.
To learn how to use Base, I suggest this tutorial: http://sheepdogguides.

Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Creating Graphics
OpenOffice comes with a graphics program named Draw (shown in Figure 5-11). 
To run the program, while in Writer, Calc or Impress, select New from the File 
menu and then choose the Drawing menu item.
 
Draw is a vector graphics program. That means it uses objects such as points, 
lines, and shapes to create images. A raster graphics program (such as Paint) 
uses individual bits to create an image. Vector graphics programs are primar-
ily used for commercial art, drawing floor plans or schematics, and creating 
organizational charts. Raster graphics programs are for editing digital photos 
or scanned images.
Considering the Eee PC’s small screen and touchpad and its relatively under-

Draw is fine for working on simple graphics or sketching out ideas during a 
meeting, but leave everything else for your primary PC.

T
he Linux Eee PC’s Work tab is where you go to get things done. In 
Chapter 5, I bring you up to speed on OpenOffice applications that come 
with the mini-laptop. In this chapter, I continue with the productivity theme 
by presenting the other programs located in the Work tab (as shown in 
Figure 6-1).
In this tab you find a PDF viewer, e-mail client, file manager, calculator, 
Personal Information Manager, and other useful productivity applications.
So let’s get down to work and investigate them.
 
You can find basic instructions for all the programs I describe in this chapter 
in the Eee PC’s online help. At the Linux desktop, click the Help menu item and 
then select the Work tab.

Viewing PDF Documents
PDF files (Portable Document Format files), more commonly known as Adobe 
Acrobat files, are just about everywhere you look. Recognizing this, ASUS 
included a program to view them on the Eee PC.
When you click the PDF Reader icon in the Work tab, Adobe Reader runs as 
shown in Figure 6-2.
This is a full version of Adobe Reader for Linux, with the same basic user inter-
face and features found in Windows releases of the program. Because Adobe 
Reader is so widely known, I won’t take up space describing how to use it.
If you need more information on the program, consult the online help or visit 
www.adobe.com/products/reader/.
 
The bottom of the Print dialog box in Adobe Reader appears off the screen on 
Eee PCs with smaller monitors. This means you can’t click the Print button. 
Press the Alt key, hold down the left mouse button, and then drag up the 
dialog box with the touchpad to get to the button.
 
If your Eee PC came with version 7.0 of Adobe Reader, you might be wonder-
ing whether you should upgrade to the latest version (8.0 at the time of this 
writing). My recommendation for upgrading any software that comes pre-
installed on the Eee PC is this: If you don’t have a compelling reason, don’t 
upgrade. I discuss the reasons for this seemingly controversial approach in 
Chapter 12.

E-mail with Thunderbird
When you click the Mail icon in the Work tab, it loads a popular open-source 
e-mail client called Thunderbird, as shown in Figure 6-3. This program is from 
the same folks that bring you the Firefox Web browser. (Note: If you have a 
2G Eee PC, Thunderbird doesn’t come preinstalled.)

client.
 

94
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Some of Thunderbird’s features include the following:
 
✓ Outstanding spam filtering
 
✓ Easy access to Gmail and .Mac/MobileMe Web mail accounts
 
✓ Built-in spell checking
 
✓ Customizable themes and user interface
 
✓ Integrated newsreader
 
✓ Phishing (scam Web site) protection
 
An alternative to Thunderbird and other traditional e-mail clients is to use a 
Web-based e-mail account, such as Hotmail, Gmail, or Yahoo Mail. Advantages 
include no synchronization issues with e-mail messages spread across differ-
ent computers and no need to worry about large volumes of e-mail taking up 
precious drive space.
To learn more about Thunderbird (or to download a Windows or Mac ver-
sion) visit http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/.
If you have a support question, check out the forums at http://forums.
mozillazine.org.
Importing and exporting data
You can import and export data between Thunderbird and many e-mail and 
PIM programs as well as Web mail services. The following is a link to step-
by-step instructions on importing and exporting e-mail data for a variety of 
popular programs and services:
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Importing_and_exporting_your_mail
If you want to import data to your Eee PC running Thunderbird, follow the 
directions and save the data from the other e-mail program or service to a 
USB thumb drive.
After you have done so, follow the instructions for importing, using the USB 
thumb drive plugged into the Eee PC as the data source.
Enhancing Thunderbird with add-ons
Thunderbird has a number of free add-ons to expand its functionality and 
usefulness.

95
 Chapter 6: Getting Down to Work II: Other Programs
Add-ons come in three different forms:
 
✓ Extensions — Small programs designed to extend Thunderbird’s 
features.
 
✓ Languages — Changes the user interface language (for example, the Eee 
PC comes with several Chinese-language packs installed so localized 
programs can be used in Chinese markets).
 
✓ Themes — Code that changes Thunderbird’s appearance.
Add-ons tend to be relatively small in size and typically don’t take up a lot of 
drive space.
They are also very easy to install. The Thunderbird add-ons Web site 
(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) contains 
descriptions, links, and reviews of available add-ons. Installation is a matter 
of clicking a few buttons as I describe in the following section.
Finally, add-ons are platform independent. That means if you run 
Thunderbird in Windows and have a favorite add-on, you can also use it with 
your Eee PC.
Installing a Thunderbird add-on
To download and install a Thunderbird add-on, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an add-on that you want to install from the Thunderbird add-on 
Web site.
 
2. Right-click the add-on link and choose Save Link As to download and 
save the file to your Eee PC’s drive.
 
3. In the Thunderbird Tools menu, select Add-ons.
 
4. At the bottom of the dialog box, click the Install button.
 
5. Select the file you downloaded and click Open.
 
6. Click the Install Now button in the Software Installation dialog box.
 
7. Click the Restart Thunderbird button.
After Thunderbird restarts, the add-on is available to use.
Setting preferences
You can set preferences for an add-on you just installed. In the Tools menu, 
select Add-ons. A dialog box is shown with add-ons that are currently installed 
in Thunderbird. You can use it to make modifications to the following:

96
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
✓ An add-on extension — You can click a button to set preferences, dis-
able or enable the add-on, or uninstall it.
 
✓ A theme — You can choose to use that theme or uninstall it. When you 
change themes, you need to restart Thunderbird for the theme to take 
effect.
 
✓ A language — You can enable or disable a language pack.
To set preferences, an add-on may install an icon in the toolbar or add a 
menu item to the Tools menu.
 
If you’ve installed an add-on and no longer use it, be sure to uninstall to save 
drive space.
To get you started with add-ons, here are a few of my favorites that you may 
want to try and where you can find them:
 
✓ Lightning — Adds a calendar features to Thunderbird (https://
addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/2313).
 
✓ miniBird — A theme well-suited for the Eee PC that shrinks 
Thunderbird’s interface (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/
thunderbird/addon/1064).
 
✓ Signature Switch — Changes your e-mail signature (great if you’re using 
multiple accounts) (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/
thunderbird/addon/611).
 
✓ Contacts Sidebar — Displays an address books in a sidebar (https://
addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/70).
Managing Files
When you click File Manager in the Work tab, it loads the Xandros File 
Manager (as shown in Figure 6-4). With the File Manager you can do the 
following:
 
✓ Access and display files on the internal drive and external storage 
devices (SD cards, USB thumb and hard drives, and CD/DVD drives)
 
✓ Copy, delete, and rename files
 
✓ Search for files
 
✓ Access shared network resources

97
 Chapter 6: Getting Down to Work II: Other Programs
 
Figure 6-4: 
The Eee 
PC File 
Manager.
 
If you have experience using Windows Explorer, the Eee PC’s File Manager 
generally works the same. Here are a few tips to get you started:
 
✓ Double-click a folder to open it.
 
✓ Select a file by single-clicking. You can then copy it to a folder by 
dragging.
 
✓ Double-click a file to load it and run the associated program (if the Eee 
PC doesn’t know which program to use, it asks you).
 
✓ Right-click a file to display properties.
 
✓ Use the View menu to change how files are displayed (icons, thumbnails, 
detailed listings, and so on).
 
✓ Use the Window menu to change how windows and files are displayed.
To learn more about the File Manager and how to use all its features, go to 
the Help menu and select File Manager Handbook.
 
By default, the File Manager only allows you to access files and directories in 
your Home directory and on external devices. To view all files and directories, 
including hidden ones, in the File Manager’s View menu select Show Hidden 
Files and Show All File Systems.

98
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Accessing external storage
Whenever you insert an SD card or a USB device (thumb drive, hard drive, or 
CD/DVD drive) into the Eee PC, a dialog box is displayed that asks if you want 
to view the contents in the File Manager. If you click OK, the File Manager 
runs, and directories and files on the card or drive are displayed.
External storage devices are shown in the left window below the My Home 
icon (as shown in Figure 6-4). On older Eee PC models that don’t have the 
latest operating system updates, note the following:
 
✓ USB devices are labeled with the name of the device.
 
✓ SD cards are labeled MMC-SD.
Click the plus sign to the left of the device icon to display the contents in the 
right window.
With SD cards and USB drives, on older Eee PC models a folder named parti-
tion1 is shown. Click the partition1 folder to display files and directories on 
the card or USB drive.
Newer models and older Eee PCs that have the latest system updates display 
devices and drives with letters (such as D:), just like you’re used to with 
Windows. Click the device letter to show files and directories.
Accessing network resources
If you are connected to a network, you can use the File Manager to access 
other computers on the network.
At the bottom of the left window are two icons, labeled as follows:
 
✓  Windows Network
 
✓ NFS Network (Network File System — widely used with UNIX-type 
computers)
You may want to connect to a Windows network (such as a workgroup 
you’ve created at home, so multiple computers can share files). I discuss Eee 
PC networking in Chapter 3, but here are some quick steps on how to access 
a network with the File Manager:
 
1. Double-click the Windows Network icon.
 
 A list of available workgroups is displayed in the right window. (The Eee 
PC lists the default named Workgroup and any other workgroups that 
are available.)

99
 Chapter 6: Getting Down to Work II: Other Programs
 
2. Double-click the name of your workgroup.
 
 Computers that have been set up to share files and printers are shown.
 
3. Double-click the computer you want to connect to.
 
 If a password is required, enter the password. Shared folders and print-
ers associated with the computer are shown.
 
4. Double-click a folder to access files stored inside.
 
The File Manager also can serve as a Web browser. In the View menu, select 
Toolbars➪Address Bar. If you have an Internet connection, you can now enter 
a Web site address, and it will be displayed in the right window. Although this 
is a browsing option, I still recommend using Firefox as your primary browser.
Helpful Accessories
Clicking the Accessories icon in the Work tab displays the three icons shown 
in Figure 6-5:
 
✓ Calculator is, drum roll please, a calculator program.
 
✓ PIM is a Personal Information Manager.
 
✓ Screen Capture allows you to take a picture of whatever is on your Eee 
PC’s screen.
Read on for more information about these programs.

Adding things up with Calculator
Clicking Calculator runs a program called KCalc. KCalc (shown in Figure 6-6) 
is a scientific calculator. To use it, click a number or symbol button or type 
with the Eee PC keyboard. You can add different types of function buttons 
(such as statistics, logic, and trigonometric) in the Settings menu.

To learn more about the calculator, in the Help menu select KCalc Handbook 
or read the user manual on the Web at http://docs.kde.org/kde3/en/
kdeutils/kcalc/index.html.
Managing personal information
When you click the PIM (Personal Information Manager) icon, an open-source 
program named Kontact runs. Kontact (its interface is shown in Figure 6-7) 
brings together several KDE applications that are installed on your Eee PC 
but aren’t readily available through desktop icons. These programs include
 
✓ E-mail client
 
✓ Contact list

101
 Chapter 6: Getting Down to Work II: Other Programs
 
✓ Calendar
 
✓ To-do list
 
✓ Journal
 
✓ Pop-up notes
 
Other components including RSS feeds, news, and synchronization, are also 
available. In the Settings menu, choose Select Components to add these other 
programs to the PIM.
If you’re using another program or Web service to manage contact, calendar, and 
e-mail information, you may want to share the data with Kontact. Here’s how:
 
✓ Microsoft Outlook — Use the free, open-source Outport utility, which 
exports Outlook data in a variety of formats. You can then import the 
data into Kontact. Visit http://outport.sourceforge.net/ to 
learn more.
 
✓ Google Apps — You can easily sync data from Google Apps (such as 
Gmail and Google Calendar) with Kontact. Here’s a link to a step-by-step 
tutorial: www.linux.com/feature/122054.
To find out more about Kontact, in the Help menu select Personal Information 
Manager Handbook or visit the project Web site at: www.kontact.org/.

Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Capturing screens
Clicking the Screen Capture icon runs a program called KSnapshot (as 
shown in Figure 6-8). KSnapshot is a screen-grabber utility. It’s similar to 
the Windows Prnt Screen function in that it takes a snapshot of the Eee PC’s 
screen. KSnapshot offers additional capabilities such as
 
✓ Capture the full screen, a window, or a region.
 
✓ Display a preview of the captured image.
 
✓ Save, the screen directly to a named file.
 
✓ Support multiple graphics formats (BMP, JPG, and PNG to name a few).
 
✓ Delay taking a snapshot (in seconds).
Instead of running KSnapshot by using the Screen Capture icon, press Fn+Ins — 
the Ins key is also labeled Prt Sc.
 
If you’re using the Advanced Desktop mode that I describe in Chapter 19, 
press Ctrl+Fn+PrtSc to save the screen to the clipboard. Alt+Fn+PrtSc saves 
the currently selected window to the clipboard. You can then paste the clip-
board contents into a graphics program and save the screen image to a file.

103
 Chapter 6: Getting Down to Work II: Other Programs
To learn more about the screen capture utility, click the Help button in the 
dialog box and then select Ksnapshot Handbook in the pop-up menu. You can 
also read the user manual on the Web at http://docs.kde.org/stable/
en/kdegraphics/ksnapshot/.
Using the Dictionary
When you click the Dictionary icon, as you might have guessed, a dictionary 
is displayed. (Note that depending on the model and the country the Eee PC 
was destined for, the dictionary program may not be installed.)
On older Eee PC models, users were greeted with a Mandarin Chinese inter-
face that can’t easily be switched to English (as shown in Figure 6-9). Ah, 
mysteries of the East. If you have this version of the dictionary, you can still 
look up English words. Click the Eng-Eng icon (that’s English to English) and 
then select a word in the left window pane. Its definition appears to the right.
ASUS does have an updated version of Longman Dictionary that has a config-
urable English interface that’s easier to use (see the difference in Figure 6-10). 
If you have an older version of the dictionary, you can download and install 
the new version with the Add/Remove Software program in the desktop 
Settings tab. (I tell you about adding and removing software in Chapter 12.)

Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
Figure 6-10: 
The updated 
Longman

interface.
 
 
Updating to the newer version of the dictionary can potentially remove 
or change desktop icons. Before you update, I recommend backing up the 
simpleui.rc file. I show you how to do this in Chapter 21.
 
The quality of the definitions in this dictionary (at least, in English) isn’t that 
great and, if you have kids in the house, be forewarned. It contains a fair 
number of X-rated words with some rather interesting definitions.
If you’re looking for a better dictionary, I’d recommend using Stardict (http://
stardict.sourceforge.net/). Refer to this post from the EeeUser Forum 
site for information on installing http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.
php?id=6198.
The alternative is to use a Web dictionary, such as
 
✓ http://dictionary.reference.com/
 
✓ www.merriam-webster.com/
 
✓ www.thefreedictionary.com/
 
✓ www.websters-online-dictionary.org/

105
 Chapter 6: Getting Down to Work II: Other Programs
Posting Notes
The Eee PC comes with a program called KNotes for adding pop-up notes 
to the Linux desktop (a sample note is shown in Figure 6-11). These resem-
ble the common, yellow paper sticky notes that seem to be magnetically 
attracted to computer monitors.
 
KNotes is a part of the Kontact personal information manager (PIM) that I 
described earlier in the chapter. You can also access the notes program from 
within the PIM.
KNotes installs an icon in the taskbar — the icon resembles a pad of yellow 
sticky notes. Right-click the taskbar icon to display a pop-up menu with com-
mands and settings.
Right-click the title of a note on the desktop to display a pop-up menu with 
commands.
To learn more about KNotes, in the Help menu, select Popup Notes 
Handbook or read the user manual on the Web at http://docs.kde.org/

901 Eee PC and Beyond
On the 901 and later model Eee PCs you might 
find some additional icons in the desktop Work 
tab. These include:
 ✓ Draw — OpenOffice Draw graphics editor.
 ✓ Math — OpenOffice Math equation editor. 
(Keep in mind that you can still run both 
of these OpenOffice programs even if the 
icons aren’t present. I briefly discuss them 
in Chapter 5.)
 ✓ Freemind — An open-source mind-mapping 
program written in Java. For more information

to your user manual or consult the online help.

Chapter 7
Eee PC for Kids
In This Chapter
▶ Studying science
▶ Learning about language
▶ Majoring in math
▶ Getting an A in Art
▶ Using education resources on the Web
O 
 ne of the Es in Eee PC is easy to learn. Now obviously, easy to learn can 
mean easy to figure out. But in this case, I think learn has more of an 
educational connotation.
The Eee PC, particularly models running Linux, serves as a great computer 
for education and kids. Why you ask?
 
✓ It’s affordable.
 
✓ Smaller fingers like smaller keyboards.
 
✓ It can survive an occasional bump and drop (within reason).
 
✓ The operating system is stable and easy-to-use.
 
✓ Lots of productivity and educational software comes with it. (Children 
can start with kids programs and then move on to Internet and office 
applications as they progress.)
 
✓ Basic computing concepts and skills carry over to other PCs operating 
systems, and programs.
ASUS obviously views kids as potential Eee PC users, considering there’s a 
tab named Learn in the Linux desktop. The tab contains icons for all sorts of 
educational software (as shown in Figure 7-1).

108

I describe these programs in the upcoming pages as well as list other helpful 
resources for using the Eee PC as a learning tool.
If you’re a parent or grandparent considering purchasing an Eee PC for your 
child (or thinking about sharing yours with him or her every now and then,) 
read on.
 
Basic instructions for all the programs I describe in this chapter can be found 
in the Eee PC’s online help. At the Linux desktop, click the Help menu item and 
then select the Learn tab in the online help file.
Studying Science
I always liked science classes in school, so that’s where I’ll start. Clicking the 
Science icon in the Learn tab, displays two icons (as shown in Figure 7-2):
 
✓ Periodic Table is a program for learning about chemical elements.
 
✓ Planetarium is an astronomy program for viewing stars and planets.
In this section, I give you an overview of these two science programs.

109
 Chapter 7: Eee PC for Kids
 
Figure 7-2: 
The science 
programs 
in the 
Learn tab.
 
It’s elementary: The Periodic Table
Unless you’re a scientist or a teacher, you’ve probably forgotten all about the 
Periodic Table. To refresh your memory, it’s a table that contains information 
about all the known chemical elements (remember, everything on the planet 
is made up from some combination or another of these elements).
 
Get some bonus points with your kids when you tell them that Dmitri Ivanovich 
Mendeleev is credited with creating the first Periodic Table in 1869 and that 
periodic means recurring, as in recurring trends of the elements’ properties.
When I was in school, Periodic Tables were rather boring posters filled with 
little colored squares, element symbols, and other arcane information you 
had to memorize.
Times have changed, and the Periodic Table that comes with the Eee PC is 
actually kind of fun and interesting. The program (shown in Figure 7-3) is an 
open-source application called Kalzium (that’s German for Calcium in case 
you’re wondering).

110
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
Figure 7-3: 
The Kalzium 
Periodic 
Table 
brings the 
elements 
to life.
 
It has all the same information that appeared on those old classroom posters, 
but is designed to be highly interactive. You can click an element and see a 
picture of what it looks like and different element groupings. You can move a 
control to see if an element is liquid, solid, or gas at different temperatures, 
and much more.
For more on using the Periodic Table, go to the Help menu and select 
Periodic Table Handbook. You can also visit the program’s Web site at 
http://edu.kde.org/kalzium/.
Stargazing with Planetarium
If you or your child has ever looked up in the night sky and wondered about 
the stars and planets, the Eee PC comes with the perfect program for you.
Clicking the Planetarium icon runs an open-source application called KStars 
(see Figure 7-4). The stargazing program displays a simulation of the night 
sky from anywhere on Earth (for any given date and time). The extensive 
database charts over 130,000 stars, 13,000 deep-sky objects (that’s anything 
outside our solar system), constellations, the Sun, the Moon, all the planets, 
and thousands of comets and asteroids. You can zoom in, zoom out, and 
move around. It’s like having NASA inside your mini-laptop.

111
 Chapter 7: Eee PC for Kids
 
Figure 7-4: 
KStars

planetarium 
program.
 
The Eee PC is so light and portable, you can grab it at a moment’s notice and 
head outside on a clear night to see what’s out shining above. By default, 
KStars is synched to the laptop’s clock, so what you see on the screen is 
what’s in the sky at that time (stars and planets move in real time). The 
Eee PC with KStars is the perfect companion for the novice or experienced 
astronomer.
 
In the Settings menu, select Color Schemes➪Night Vision to display the stars 
and labels in a subdued red. This helps you maintain your night vision when 
you’re looking at the screen.
KStars isn’t just for kids. It’s actually a sophisticated astronomy program that 
can control telescopes and cameras, calculate celestial coordinates, show 
fields of view (it displays a circle that matches what you’d see from a pair of 
binoculars or a telescope), and more.
I recommend spending some time reading the extensive online help by select-
ing Desktop Planetarium Handbook in the Help menu. Or visit the KStars Web 
site at http://edu.kde.org/kstars/.
 
In later Eee PC models, ASUS includes a program called Stellarium in the 
Science tab. Stellarium is similar to KStars but includes photo-realistic images 
of the sky. If your Eee PC doesn’t have Stellarium preinstalled, I tell you how 
to download and install the program in Chapter 13. To learn more about 
Stellarium, visit www.stellarium.org.

Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Learning about Language
As you probably guessed, the Language tab (inside the Learn tab) relates to 
learning about letters and words (English in this case, no foreign language 
lessons here). Three programs are contained in the Language directory (as 
shown in Figure 7-5).
 
✓ Typing is a typing tutor program.
 
✓ Letter Game displays jumbled words that you need to unscramble.
 
✓ Hangman Game is an electronic version of the old kid’s game where you 
need to guess letters in a word and eventually the whole word.
Read on for more about each of these programs.
Teaching typing
When you click the Typing icon, it starts an open-source typing tutor pro-
gram called Tux Typing 2 (Figure 7-6 shows the main screen).
Tux Typing 2 (or TuxType for short), helps kids learn how to type. It three 
components are

✓ Fish Cascade — Fish with letters or words drop out of the sky, and you 
must type the correct letter or word to help feed a hungry penguin.
 
✓ Comet Zap — Comets from outer space, again with letters or words on 
them, threaten cities; and only a penguin and you can save the day by 
typing letters and words that match.
 
✓ Lessons — In addition to the two games, you can write scripts to create 
more conventional typing lessons.

Just who is Tux?
If you’re running Linux on your Eee PC, you may 
have noticed lots of references to penguins. You 
might wonder or your kids may ask, “What’s the 
deal with the cute, little penguin?”
That’s just Tux, the official mascot of Linux. 
Here’s his story.
In 1996, developers were trying to think up a 
mascot for Linux. Sharks and eagles were con-
sidered, but Linus Torvalds (the father of Linux, 
as in LInus uNIX) mentioned he was fond of 
penguins. That sealed it. A contest was then 
proposed to come up with a suitable-looking 
bird, but when Larry Ewing showed his version 
of a cuddly penguin, everyone agreed it was the 
one. Because penguins appear to be wearing 
tuxedos, someone suggested the name Tux, 
and the rest is history.
That’s the Reader’s Digest version. If you want 
the full, illustrated history of Tux, head over 
to: www.sjbaker.org/wiki/index.

Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
The games have lots of sounds with colorful animations and get high marks 
from young children in the fun department. You can set a number of different 
options, including difficulty, to make things more challenging and interesting 
as a child masters different levels.
The program has online help or, if you want to explore more, visit the project 
Web site at http://tuxtype.sourceforge.net/.
Rearrange the letters
Clicking the Letter Game icon runs a program called KMessedWords (many 
KDE programs start with the letter K, if you haven’t noticed). This is a game 
where a scrambled up word appears on the screen, and you have to suc-
cessfully enter the correct unjumbled word. The program screen is shown in 
Figure 7-7.
Three levels of difficulty make the game suitable for all ages. That includes 
adults, too. Commercial brain fitness software products often have similar 
programs for giving your mind a workout.
 
A bug sometimes causes the Letter Game icon to disappear from the Eee PC 
desktop. (I discuss the problem of vanishing icons in Chapter 22.) You can still 
run the program by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T (which brings up the Linux terminal), 
typing kmessedwords, and pressing the Enter key.

 Chapter 7: Eee PC for Kids
To learn more about playing the game, in the Help menu select Letter Order 
Game Handbook. You can also visit the program’s home page at http://
edu.kde.org/old/kmessedwords/.
Learning words with Hangman
The last program in the Language directory is Hangman Game. It’s actually an 
open-source program called KHangMan that’s based on the pencil and paper 
game where you have to figure out which letters are in a word. For each 
wrong guess, a part to the hangman is added (the game is rated G, as the 
default hangman is holding onto the rope instead of it being wrapped around 
his neck). Figure 7-8 shows a sample screen.
There are different levels of difficulty, and you can change the appearance of 
the game.
As with the other programs, Hangman offers online help (in the Help menu 
select KHangMan Handbook) or visit the game’s Web site at http://edu.
kde.org/old/khangman/.

Boning Up on Math
When you click the Math directory icon (in the Learn tab), the following four 
math-related learning programs are displayed, as shown in Figure 7-9:
 
✓ Fraction Tutorial — Test your knowledge of fractions with this drill 
program.
 
✓ TuxMath — Help Tux the Linux penguin save the world by solving math 
problems.
 
✓ Geometry — Explore the fundamentals of geometry with this interactive 
program.
 
✓ Function Plotter — Plot mathematical functions that you enter.
Here is a brief overview of each of the math programs.
Figuring out fractions
When you click Fraction Tutorial, the KBruch program runs (in German, 
Bruch means fraction — a number of developers from Germany have been 
involved in creating educational programs for KDE).
KBruch is a skill-and-drill program (a sample screen is shown in Figure 7-10) 
where you’re presented with different problems to solve, including
Sugar, Sugar
The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) XO laptop 
has a unique user interface and set of pro-
grams that were designed from the ground up 
for education. Known as Sugar, the interface 
abandons the familiar desktop metaphor found 
in Windows, OS X, and KDE (Linux) for a unique, 
activity- and group-based approach to comput-
ing. (Sugar is a bit hard to describe in words 
alone so point your browser at wiki.sugar
labs.org to get a better idea of what it’s all 
about.) 
With the OLPC project drifting away from Linux 
and towards the Windows operating system, 
Walter Bender, Sugar’s developer and former 
OLPC president of software and content estab-
lished Sugar Labs, a non-profit organization that 
works on new versions of Sugar.
When he began Sugar Labs, Bender stated he 
would like to bring Sugar to low-cost laptops 
such as the Eee PC. This would provide yet 
another option for using the Eee PC for educa-
tion. Because it’s possible to boot another oper-
ating system off of a USB thumb drive or SD 
card, you can conceivably run Sugar for your 
kids while keeping the installed version of Linux 
or Windows intact. Stay tuned to the Sugar Labs 
wiki mentioned above for more information.

The program keeps track of right and wrong answers, and you can change 
various options to make things easier or harder. (As an adult, this application 
kind of makes my brain hurt — I’m glad I’m not in school anymore.)
 
In the Help menu, select KBruch Handbook to get extensive information about 
using the program or visit http://edu.kde.org/kbruch/.
Tux the math tutor
When you click TuxMath, the Tux of Math Command game runs. (It’s a lot like 
the old arcade game Missile Command; see Figure 7-11.)
Falling fireballs threaten cities, and you and Tux have to save the world by 
entering answers to math equations. Type the correct answer and a laser 
beam blasts the fireball. The primary audience is children ages 4 to 10.
 
Figure 7-11: 
Tux of Math 
Command.
 
Lots of sound effects, color, and animation make this a fun, but educational 
game. You can change speed and the types of math problems to increase the 
difficulty.

119
 Chapter 7: Eee PC for Kids
It’s easy to figure out the game instructions, but a help option is available 
when you start the game in case you need it. (There’s more about TuxMath at 
http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org/.)
Getting in line with geometry
Clicking on the Geometry icon runs an open-source program called Kig (as in 
KDE Interactive Geometry) — a sample screen is shown in Figure 7-12. Kig is 
designed for high school (or beyond) geometry students and teachers.
Instead of using a classroom blackboard to work through geometry concepts 
and problems, Kig allows you to interactively explore geometric figures — 
you can move components to see how other parts change as a result. In addi-
tion, you can create mathematical figures with Kig to insert as illustrations in 
other documents.
Kig is a fairly advanced program that doesn’t have much use outside of geom-
etry. You can get thorough online help by selecting Kig Handbook in the Help 
menu. Or visit the Kig Web site at http://edu.kde.org/kig/.

geometry 
program.

Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Plotting functions
The last icon, Function Plotter, runs a program called KmPlot (as shown 
in Figure 7-13). KmPlot is an application for learning about relationships 
between mathematical functions and their graphical representation in a 
coordinate system. As with Kig, this is an advanced program suited for high 
school or college use.
An online manual is available in the Help menu, or you can visit the KmPlot 
home page at http://edu.kde.org/kmplot/.

KDE Education Project
The KDE Education Project is an initiative to 
create and distribute free Linux educational 
software that uses the KDE interface. Its focus 
is developing software for children ages 3 to 
18. Many of the educational programs included 
with the Eee PC are part of this project.
ASUS elected not to bundle a number of titles 
with the Eee PC, including programs for language, 
math, science, and geography. (In addition, 
the KDE Education Project is an ongoing effort, 
and new programs are occasionally added to the 
collection.)
Visit the project Web site at http://edu.
kde.org to see what programs are available. 
If you’re interested in a program that doesn’t 
come preinstalled on the Eee PC, in Chapter 12, 
I describe how to install Linux software.

 Chapter 7: Eee PC for Kids
The Next DaVinci
The Eee PC comes with several art programs. These aren’t art history or fine 
art applications, but graphics, paint-type programs. The Paint icon is actually 
a directory; and when you click it, the following two icons appear as shown in 
Figure 7-14:
 
✓ Tux Paint — A graphics application with a kids-oriented user interface.
 
✓ Paint — A traditional paint program, similar to Paint that comes with 
Microsoft Windows but with more features.
Here is more about each program.
Tux Paint for kids
Tux Paint (as shown in Figure 7-15) is designed for kids between 3 and 12 
years old. It’s a fun, easy-to-use graphics application with a surprising number 
of features (versions of Tux Paint are also available for Windows and the 
Mac). You can learn more about Tux Paint by visiting www.tuxpaint.org.
If you turn a kid loose with the program, he or she will soon figure it all out 
by experimentation and trial and error. (Consider turning the speaker volume 
down if you’re in the room because the sounds can get a little annoying.)
 
Figure 7-14: 
Linux paint 
programs.
 

122
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
Figure 7-15: 
Tux Paint 
for kids.
 
However if you’re not a kid, here are a few tips on getting started using the 
program — just in case junior has a question or two.
Tools
On the left side of the window (see Figure 7-15) are a series of tools — each 
icon has a symbol and a name so you have a general idea of what it does. 
Click an icon to select the tool. Tux the penguin gives you some additional 
guidance at the bottom of the screen.
On the right side of the window are more icons. These icons change depend-
ing on the tool you select. For example, when you click the Paint tool, dif-
ferent brushes appear. Or if you click the Text tool, a choice of fonts is 
displayed.
 
The Magic tool in the toolbar has lots of special effects, including darkening, 
lightening, blurring, and paint fill.
Below the drawing area is a line of color icons. Click an icon to select its asso-
ciated color for drawing.
Opening and Saving
Files are stored in an easy-to-use thumbnail directory (a number of coloring-
book style, line drawings are included to get a child started). The directory is 
displayed when you click the Open tool. Select a picture you want to edit and 
then click the Open button.

123
 Chapter 7: Eee PC for Kids
When you save a picture, you’re not prompted for a name. The file is saved 
to the drive, and the picture appears in the directory when you use the Open 
tool. If you make changes to an existing picture, the program asks if you want 
to replace the old picture or save a new one.
 
That’s enough with the tips. You’ll need to play with the program to learn 
more. And be sure not to have too much fun.
Mastering mtPaint
If you’re looking for a graphics program that’s more suited for older kids and 
adults, click the Paint icon. This runs an open-source program called mtPaint 
(the mt stands for Mark Tyler by the way, the developer, as in Mark Tyler’s 
Painting Program).A sample screen is shown in Figure 7-16.
mtPaint is a raster graphics program, which means it’s designed to work with 
individual pixels. It supports BMP, GIF, JPEG, and PNG file formats and has a 
number of advanced features.
I find mtPaint especially useful for reducing the size of digital photos for 
e-mail or blogs and doing quick edits. The Eee PC’s portability makes it easy 
to carry around with a digital camera. Shoot some photos, insert the cam-
era’s SD card into the Eee PC, and you’re ready to go. When you’re done with 
your edits, find a wireless connection, and share your photos with the world.
 
Figure 7-16: 
mtPaint is 
for older 
kids and 
adults.
 

124
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
In the Load Image File dialog box, if you can’t traverse folders by clicking, 
select the folder you want to open and then press Enter.
The mtPaint online manual doesn’t come installed; so if you want to learn 
more about the program, go to http://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/.
Learning on the Web
When you click the Web Learn icon (on the Learn tab), it opens the browser 
and, if you have an Internet connection, loads a site called Skoool (www.
skoool.ie). This is an interactive education project designed to serve 
Ireland’s secondary and high school students. The online program debuted 
in 2002, and has won many awards. Its model is being adopted in other coun-
tries around the world with sponsorship from Intel. To visit other Skoool 
projects and to find out more, go to www.skoool.com.
I want to mention a few other education-related sites that the Eee PC doesn’t 
reference. Parents and teachers may find these useful.
Internet4Classrooms
Internet4Classrooms (alias I4C) is an amazing collection of links, tutorials, and 
other resources for K-12 teachers. Even if you’re not a teacher, this is a great 
place to find educational activities for your kids to supplement their school 
curriculums. The site is located at www.internet4classrooms.com.
Edubuntu
Edubuntu (www.edubuntu.org) is an edu-
cational version of the popular Ubuntu Linux 
distribution. It comes with a large number of 
education-related programs for kids as well 
as the usual Internet and office applications. 
Edubuntu has most of the same learning pro-
grams that come with the Eee PC plus some 
different ones. (Check the Web site for details.)
It’s possible to install Edubuntu on an Eee PC — 
either on a bootable USB drive or by reformatting 
the drive and replacing Xandros. However, the 
full versions of Edubuntu and Ubuntu are both 
rather resource intensive and can tax the Eee 
PCs memory and processor (especially the 2G 
and 4G models).
Instead, use a light version of Ubuntu (such as 
eeeXbuntu) and then install any of education 
programs you’re interested in. Or see if any of 
the programs are available in the repositories I 
discuss in Chapter 12.

125
 Chapter 7: Eee PC for Kids
Curriki
Curriki (as in Curriculum Wiki) is where teachers share curriculum and 
resources. You can find lesson plans, lectures in PowerPoint, and all manner 
of classroom-proven material. Visit the site at www.curriki.org.
Ed Tech Review
If you want to keep up with technology in education (including software, Web 
sites, and hardware), Ed Tech Review (www.edtechreview.net) is a great 
blog to consult. Besides the new content, it’s worthwhile spending some time 
going through the archives and reading older posts.
AOL Kids Homework Help
Whereas the other sites I’ve just mentioned have been for grown-ups, this 
one is for children. America Online (AOL) developed a kid-friendly (and safe) 
Web site called KOL (Kids Online). One of the featured sections is called 
Homework Help, which has a number of educational resources and links 
for kids. You can check out the site at http://kids.aol.com/KOL/1/
HomeworkHelp.
 
AOL ran a pretty good educational Web site called AOL@SCHOOL (www.aolat
school.com) with content for both students and teachers. The educator tools 
and resources are now housed at the National Education Association’s (NEA) 
Academy Web site (www.nea.org/classroom/aol.html).
More Learn icons
On the 901 and later model Eee PCs you might 
find some additional icons in the desktop Learn 
tab. These include:
 ✓ Mebook — The MeReader e-book viewer
 ✓ Go Chinese — A program that teaches you 
the basics of Chinese languages
 ✓ Kids Game — A collection of children’s 
educational games
 ✓ Star Map — The Stellarium star program 
that I describe in the Studying Science sec-
tion of this chapter
For more information on these programs, refer 
to your user manual or consult the online help.

Eee PC at Play
In This Chapter
▶ Playing Eee PC games
▶ Watching videos
▶ Listening to music
▶ Working with digital photos
▶ Using the Web cam
▶ Recording sound
A
ll work and no play makes the Eee PC a dull computer (or something 
like that). ASUS recognized this universal truth, and decided to include 
a variety of programs on the mini-laptop that are expressly designed for your 
enjoyment and entertainment.
In this chapter, I look at programs found in the Linux desktop Play tab (as 
shown in Figure 8-1). These include a collection of games (some new ones 
and a few familiar old favorites), a media player for watching videos, a music 
manager for playing tunes, a digital photo manager, a Web cam utility, and a 
sound recorder.
So kick back and relax, and let’s get down to the serious business of play.
 
You can find basic instructions for all the programs I describe in this chapter 
in the Eee PC’s online help. At the Linux desktop, click the Help menu item and 
then in the browser window, select the Play tab.

Playing Games
You can’t have a computer without games, so it should be no surprise that 
lots of games come installed on the Eee PC.
Clicking the Games icon in the Play tab displays seven program icons shown 
in Figure 8-2. These icons include
 
✓ Solitaire is the ever-popular, time-wasting card game.
 
✓ Frozen Bubble is a game where you shoot colored bubbles to form 
groups of the same color.
 
✓ Crack Attack is a variation of the popular Tetris Attack, a Super 
Nintendo game.
 
✓ Penguin Racer turns Tux the penguin into a bobsled that you guide 
down snowy mountains.
 
✓ Sudoku is an electronic version of the popular number-based, logic 
puzzle.
 
✓ Potato Guy is the game where you dress up a potato (and other 
characters).
 
✓ LTris is a Linux version of the classic Tetris game.
Read on for more information about all these games.

Solitaire
When you click the Solitaire icon, you’re rewarded with the card game 
that bosses love to hate, as shown in Figure 8-3. It’s a Linux version named 
KPatience. (Americans call the game Solitaire, whereas Europeans call it 
Patience — the developers who wrote this program were Europeans.)
More games
In addition to the games I just listed, if you have 
a 901 or later model Eee PC you’ll find several 
more games preinstalled. These include
 ✓ TuxPuck is a virtual air hockey game (see 
http://home.no.net/munsuun/
tuxpuck/).
 ✓ Supertux is a Linux version of the popular 
SuperMario arcade games (see http://
supertux.lethargik.org/).
 ✓ BOS Wars is a real-time strategy war 
game — with an economic twist (see 
www.boswars.org/).
 ✓ Mahjongg is the classic Chinese board 
game where you match tiles (see www.
lcdf.org/xmahjongg/).
 ✓ Enigma is a puzzle game where you 
uncover pairs of colored stones (see www.
nongnu.org/enigma/).
For more information on these programs, refer 
to your user manual or consult the online help. 
If you don’t have these games installed but are 
interested in them, I tell you how to download 
and install Linux software in Chapter 12.

Frozen Bubble
Frozen Bubble (as shown in Figure 8-4) is one of more popular Linux arcade-
style games. You control a small cannon that dispenses colored bubbles (you 
aim with right- and left-arrow keys and the up-arrow key fires). You shoot at 
bubbles at the top of the screen, trying to group three or more bubbles of the 
same color. When you match a group, the bubbles come falling down. The 
goal is to get all the bubbles to fall.

Use the arrow keys and Enter to select options when you first start the game. 
Press the Esc key to end the game.
You can play the game solo or with others (including over the Net), at dif-
ferent difficulty levels. Read the basic instructions when you start Frozen 
Bubble, or visit the game’s home page at www.frozen-bubble.org.
Crack Attack
Crack Attack (as shown in Figure 8-5) is based on the Tetris Attack game 
for Super Nintendo. Crack Attack gets its name from its fiendishly addictive 
nature.
The goal of the game is to keep a rising stacks of blocks from reaching the top 
of the screen (as time goes on, the speed of the rising blocks increases). Get 
rid of blocks by lining up three or more blocks of the same color. You do this 
using a set of brackets controlled by the arrow keys. Press the spacebar to 
switch the positions of two blocks between the brackets or to move a single 
block. Use the brackets to line up same colored blocks or make them drop.
 
Press P to pause. Press P again to resume.
If you get addicted to the game on your Eee PC, versions are available for 
Windows and Mac and can be downloaded at: www.nongnu.org/crack-
attack.

Penguin Racer
When you click Penguin Racer, a game called PlanetPenguin Racer loads. This 
is a version of the popular Tux Racer game. Tux is Linux’s penguin mascot, 
who in this case is sliding down a mountain on his front side like an avian 
bobsled (see what I mean in Figure 8-6).
 
Figure 8-6: 
The Planet-
Penguin

133
 Chapter 8: Eee PC at Play
You control Tux with the right- and left-arrow keys. The down arrow slows 
him down and the up arrow paddles his flippers, which makes him go faster 
at low speeds. (Use the cursor to click Configuration when the game first 
loads to see other keyboard commands.)
Keep the penguin on course between the race flags and score extra points by 
collecting fish on the way down the hill. Press Esc when you’re done playing.
For more on the game, check out the Wiki entry at http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Tux_Racer.
Sudoku
Sudoku (as shown in Figure 8-7) is the digital version of the internationally 
popular number puzzle that appears in newspapers, magazines, and books. 
The game features nine large squares (blocks), with each block composed of 
nine smaller squares. The goal is to fill the squares so each column, row, and 
each of the blocks contains the numbers 1 to 9 only one time each.
Click a square, and then enter a number. If that number is already in a 
column, row, or block, it turns red. If you need a little assistance, click the 
Hint icon in the toolbar (it looks like a lifesaving ring) to show what possible 
values can fit in the currently selected square.
This is a great “brain training” game for improving your observation, logic, 
and reasoning skills.

Potato Guy
Click the Potato Guy icon to play a kids game called KTuberling (you may 
have noticed some of the KDE programs have rather unique K names; in this 
case, a potato is also known as a tuber). This is a digital version of the old 
Mr. Potato Head game, where you stick eyes, a nose, a mouth, and other dec-
orative ornaments on a spud (as shown in Figure 8-8). You can also dress up 
Tux the penguin and create a deep sea aquarium scene. When you’re finished 
with your masterpiece you can print or save the picture.
Potato Guy is pretty straightforward to play, but if you need documentation, 
in the Help menu, select KTuberling Handbook or read the user manual on

LTris
LTris is a clone of the classic 1980s computer game Tetris. If you wonder 
where the name Tetris came from, it’s a mix of tetra (all the pieces contain 
four segments) and tennis, the author’s favorite sport.
The goal of the game is to, well, keep playing. Prevent the falling pieces from 
stacking up and reaching the top of the screen by arranging the blocks so 
they form an unbroken horizontal line across the playing area. This elimi-
nates that row of blocks. An example screen is shown in Figure 8-9.

Here are some of its features:
 
✓ Support for common file formats including MPEG, DivX, Windows Media, 
RealAudio/Video, and QuickTime
 
✓ DVD playback
 
✓ Extensive subtitle support
 
✓ Internet audio and video streaming support
 
✓ User-created playlists
 
✓ Multiple playback speeds

 Chapter 8: Eee PC at Play
 
Many Eee PC users run a DVD-ripping program on their primary computer, 
and then save the DVD movie to an SD card. This makes it easy to watch 
movies on the Eee PC without an attached DVD player. If you’ve never ripped 
a DVD before (converted a DVD to a file that can be played on a computer 
using SMPlayer or another media player), a number of free programs make the 
process easy. For more information on the programs and the process, visit 
www.doom9.org/.
 
The version of MPlayer that comes with the Eee PC does not support h.264 
format QuickTime videos. This means you won’t be able to play videos cre-
ated for the Apple iPod. You can convert the videos to another format or do 
a bit of hacking and install an older version of MPlayer that supports h.264 
videos. Here’s a tutorial on installing the older version: http://wiki.
eeeuser.com/downgradingmplayer.
SMPlayer doesn’t come with online help, so to learn more about the program, 
visit the project Web site at: http://smplayer.sourceforge.net/.
Adding additional codecs
If you have a video that SMPlayer won’t play, it’s probably because an associ-
ated codec isn’t present. A codec (which stands for coder-decoder or com-
pressor-decompressor) is a program (or file with instructions for a program) 
to compress or decompress audio and video. Depending on how the video 
was encoded, you may need to install another codec to view it.
For example, if you save a YouTube video (in FLV, Flash Video format) to 
your Eee PC, SMPlayer plays the video with no audio. However, after you 
install additional codes, as I describe in the following section, the video plays 
with sound.
A program called Codec Pack is compatible with SMPlayer. It contains a 
number of different codecs. Here’s how to install the Pack:
 
1. Connect to the Internet.
 
2. Open a Linux console window by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
3. Enter the following: sudo /usr/share/mplayer/scripts/binary_
codecs.sh install.
This runs a shell script that installs the codecs. Status messages are dis-
played during the installation. After the Codec Pack is successfully installed 
you should be able to play the video you initially had troubles with.

Watching DVDs
If you have a USB DVD player and want to use SMPlayer to watch DVD movies 
on your Eee PC, you first download and install some additional files.
 
The files needed to view DVDs are in a library called libdvdcss. This library 
contains code for accessing and unscrambling DVDs encrypted with the 
Content Scramble System (CSS) protection scheme.
To download and install the files required to watch a DVD, follow these steps:
 
1. On your Eee PC, go to this Web site at http://download.videolan.
org/pub/libdvdcss/1.2.9/.
 
2. Click the deb/ directory.
 
3. Click libdvdcss2_1.2.9-1_i386.deb.
 
4. Select Save to Disk and click OK
 
5. Click the Save button to save the file to My Documents.
 
6. With the File Manager, go to the My Documents directory.
 
7. Right-click libdvdcss2_1.2.9-1_i386.deb, and from the pop-up menu 
select Install DEB File….
 
 You must provide the password you set the first time you ran your Eee 
PC. A dialog box tells you when the installation is complete.
After the files are installed (and the DVD player is connected to your Eee PC 
with a DVD inserted), run SMPlayer. From the Open menu, select DVD from 
drive to watch your movie.
 
If the audio and video don’t synch, in the SMPlayer Options menu select 
Preferences. Check Allow frame drop and click OK.

139
 Chapter 8: Eee PC at Play
 
On 901 and later model Eee PCs, ASUS includes a standalone, commercial 
DVD program in the desktop Play tab called LinDVD. The program is easy 
to use and doesn’t require all the tweaking that SMPlayer does in order to 
watch DVDs.
Managing and Playing Music
Clicking the Music Manager icon runs an open-source program called Amarok 
(as shown in Figure 8-11). As the icon name suggests, Amarok is a digital 
music player and organizer. You can listen to music stored on
 
✓ The Eee PC’s drive
 
✓ An inserted SD card
 
✓ An inserted USB thumb or hard drive
 
✓ A commercial music CD using an external USB CD/DVD player
 
✓ The Internet
 
Figure 8-11: 
The Amarok 
music 
player.
 

140
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Some of Amarok’s features include
 
✓ Compatibility with common media formats such as MP3, WMA, FLAC, 
WAV and others. (However, Amarok doesn’t play files with Digital Rights 
Management protection, such as music downloaded from iTunes or 
other commercial sources.)
 
✓ Internet audio streaming and podcast support.
 
✓ MP3 player synchronization.
 
✓ Cover art display.
 
✓ File tagging including MusicBrainz searches. (MusicBrainz.org is a 
free online database that supplies artist and recording information.)
 
✓ The capability to look up and attach lyrics to songs.
 
✓ Visual effects.
 
✓ User-created playlists.
 
When you run Amarok, it adds an icon to the taskbar. Right-click the icon to 
Quit. If only the small, play window is displayed, click the PL button to show 
the main playlist window.
To learn more about using Amarok, in the Help menu select Music Manager 
Handbook or visit the project Web site at http://amarok.kde.org/.
iPod info
If you have an Apple iPod (and who doesn’t 
these days?), here’s the lowdown on using it 
with the Eee PC.
First off, currently no iTunes compatible pro-
grams run on Linux. So don’t expect to be able 
to use iTunes on your Eee PC (unless it’s run-
ning Windows XP).
Amarok will synch up music with your iPod 
just like iTunes. But, there’s a big catch, so 
pay close attention. If you have version 1.4.3 of 
Amarok (select About Music Manager in the 
Help menu to see) and an iPod that’s newer than 
June 2007, do not try to synch your iPod with 
Amarok. A problem with this release of Amarok 
can corrupt the iPod’s song database. You may 
be forced to reload all your songs on the iPod 
(always a good idea to have them synched on 
another computer, just in case) or perform a 
system reset. This problem doesn’t seem to be 
present with older iPods. If you have a newer 
iPod, either update Amarok or use a Linux iPod 
program called gtkPod (www.gtkpod.org). 
A tutorial for installing gtkPod on the Eee PC 
can be found at http://wiki.eeeuser.
com/gtkpod.
You can charge your iPod on the Eee PC without 
running Amarok. In fact, the Eee PC even pro-
vides power from its USB ports when it’s turned 
off (as long as it’s plugged into a wall socket).

 Chapter 8: Eee PC at Play
Viewing Photos and Graphics Files
The Eee PC comes with a great image viewer named Gwenview. When you 
click the Photo Manager icon, the image viewer loads and displays thumb-
nails of graphics files in the My Pictures folder of your My Documents direc-
tory (if image files are in a subfolder, you open the folder first). Figure 8-12 
show Gwenview in action, displaying the contents of the sample Album folder 
that comes with the Eee PC.
 
Right-click a thumbnail to copy, rename, move, or delete an image file. You 
can also edit a file by selecting a graphics program called KolourPaint from the 
External Tools pop-up menu.
Some of Gwenview’s features include
 
✓ Browse, view, and open graphics files (including BMP, EPS, JPEG, PNG, 
and other common formats)
 
✓ Resize and rotate images
 
✓ Play a slide show
 
✓ Display images in full screen mode
 
✓ Use KIPI add-ons (KDE Image Plugin Interface — small add-on programs 
for manipulating images)

To learn more about using Gwenview, in the Help menu select Photo Manager 
Handbook or visit the project Web site at http://gwenview.source
forge.net/.
 
If you upgrade to a newer version of Photo Manager and the Plugins menu is 
no longer displayed, check out this fix courtesy of the EeeUser.com Wiki at 
http://wiki.eeeuser.com/gwenviewui-rc_file_fix.
Organizing Video Files
Don’t expect a video-related program with this icon! When you click Video 
Manager, the File Manager runs and opens the My Videos folder in your My 
Documents folder of your Home directory. Otherwise, Video Manager isn’t an 
application, but just a quick way to view any videos you have stored in the 
My Videos folder.
You can copy, delete, and rename files as well as use any of the other File 
Manager commands.
Smiling for the Web Camera
When you click the Web Cam icon a program called ucview runs. Ucview 
works with the Eee PC’s built-in Web cam and allows you to record videos 
Viewing digital camera photos
Instead of looking at the photos you just took 
on your digital camera’s small screen, put 
Gwenview and your Eee PC to work. You can 
view individual photos or use Gwenview’s slide-
show feature to automatically display a series 
of images.
The two ways to view digital photos are
 ✓ Insert the camera’s SD card into the Eee 
PC and select the folder you want to display 
with Gwenview.
 ✓  If your digital camera comes with a USB 
cable, connect the camera to the Eee PC. 
Then turn on the camera, select the camera, 
and choose the camera folder you want to 
display within Gwenview.
To connect your camera to an Eee PC, the 
camera must be able to function as a USB stor-
age device; often called UMS (Universal Mass 
Storage) or MSC (Mass Storage Class). Read 
your camera user manual to see if it has this 
feature and how to turn it on. If your camera 
can serve as a USB device, you can also view 
and access photos with File Manager.

143
 Chapter 8: Eee PC at Play
and still images. The program’s main window displays what the camera sees, 
as shown in Figure 8-13.
 
When the Web cam is turned on, a green light next to the camera lens is lit up.
You control the program with the following command icons in the toolbar:
 
✓ Pause pauses recording. Click Pause again to resume.
 
✓ Save Image saves a JPEG file of the current Web cam image.
 
✓ Record Video starts recording video (and sound). Click Record Video 
again to stop recording. The video is processed and saved to the My 
Videos folder in My Documents. Double-click a video in File Manager to 
play the file with an SMPlayer.
 
Videos are saved in OGG Theora file format (see http://theora.org for 
additional information). Ogg Theora is an open-source alternative to the MPEG 
format. If you want to play an OGG video on another computer, you may need 
to install a codec for your media player or install VLC (www.videolan.org/
vlc/), a multi-platform media play that can play OGG files as well as most 
other video formats.
 
✓ Adjustments lets you change brightness, contrast, and other color 
settings.
 
✓ Preferences controls the video quality and specifies where the video 
and still images are saved to.

Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
If you’re going to be shooting a lot of video, especially if you have an Eee PC 
with a small amount of drive space, set the file save path to an SD card instead 
of to the internal drive.
There’s not much online documentation available for ucview, so if you run 
into a question or problem, I suggest posting a message to the EeeUser.com 
forums that I discuss in Chapter 10.
Recording Voice and Sounds
You can take advantage of the Eee PC’s soundcard, built-in microphone (or 
use an external one), and preinstalled software to record voice, music, and 
sounds. When you click the Sound Recorder icon, a program named krecord 
runs (as shown in Figure 8-14).
Some of krecord’s features include
 
✓ Easy-to-use interface
 
✓ The capability to record and play WAV files
 
✓ Variable recording options including sample rate, number of channels, 
and 8- or 16-bit PCM
 
✓ Multiple file support
 
✓ Input level and frequency spectrum displays
 
WAV files are uncompressed and can take up a fair amount of memory and 
drive space. For example, with default settings, 30 seconds of recording is 
over 5MB. You can reduce size of a recorded sound by changing the audio 
format to 8-bit, using mono instead of stereo, and lowering the sampling rate.
For more on using krecord, in the Help menu select Sound Recorder 
Handbook.
Web cam wizardry
You can manually turn the Web cam on and 
off with the following console commands. First 
press Ctrl+Alt+T to display a console window.
To turn the camera on, type
sudo echo 1 > /proc/acpi/
asus/camera
To turn the camera off, type
sudo echo 0 > /proc/acpi/
asus/camera

More Play icons 
On the 901 and later model Eee PCs you might 
find some additional icons in the desktop Play 
tab. Besides the new games I mention in the 
“Playing Games” section at the start of the 
chapter, added programs include
 ✓ DVD Player — A standalone, commercial 
DVD player called LinDVD. Remember, 
you’ll need an external DVD player to watch 
movies on your Eee PC.
 ✓ Picasa — The popular program for manag-
ing, editing, and sharing digital photos (see 
http://picasa.google.com).
For more information on these programs, refer 
to your user manual or consult the online help.

I
nside the Eee PC’s Linux desktop Settings tab (shown in Figure 9-1) you 
find a number of programs for changing system settings and handling 
administrative tasks. Think of the Settings tab as the Eee PC’s control center.
 
Figure 9-1: 
The Eee PC 
Settings tab.
 

148
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
There are utilities for setting personalization options, speaker and micro-
phone volume, touchpad preferences, time and date, and external display 
device parameters. You can install printers, check for viruses, get system 
information (as well as run diagnostic tests), and update software. There’s 
even a program for starting up programs with voice commands.
In this chapter, I discuss these programs and describe how to use them.
Viewing System Info
Click the System Info icon to display system information about your Eee PC. 
A dialog box is displayed (like the one shown in Figure 9-2), that lists 
specifics such as the BIOS version, operating system version, CPU, and 
memory. If you ever need to get support for your Eee PC, it’s good to have 
this information handy.
 
Figure 9-2: 
You’ll find 
important 
info in the 
System Info 
dialog box.
 
Personalizing Your Eee PC
The Eee PC comes with several programs that allow you to personalize your 
mini-laptop. You can change the desktop theme and add frequently used 
programs to the Favorites tab, as well as change your account name and 
password. Here’s the lowdown on doing these tasks and more.
Using Personalization
Click the Personalization icon in the Settings tab to configure account name, 
password, desktop appearance, and other settings. You can see the 
Personalization program window in Figure 9-3.

149
 Chapter 9: Configuring the Eee PC
 
Figure 9-3: 
Personal-
ization 
program 
setting 
options.
 
Editing your account name and password
When you run your Eee PC for the first time, you are prompted to provide an 
account name and a password. Use the personalization program to change 
these two settings.
Changing the account name is simply a matter of typing in something new.
To change your password, enter the current one and then type in the new 
password twice; just to make sure you got it right. Passwords are displayed 
in asterisks, so if you make a typo, you won’t know what you did. If the two 
passwords don’t match, try again.
Setting the desktop theme
The Personalization program also allows you to change the desktop’s theme. 
You don’t have a lot of options for customizing the appearance as you do on 
many other computers. In fact you’re limited to choosing from the following 
four desktop color schemes:
 
✓ Silver (the default theme)
 
✓ Green
 
✓ Blue
 
✓ Sunset
Give each one a try, and see which one you like best.
 
If you want to go beyond these simple themes, check out Chapter 21 where I 
describe some advanced techniques for customizing the desktop.
Other personalization options
Other settings in the Personalization program, include

150
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
✓ The Keyboard Layout drop-down menu — This lets you change your 
keyboard to one of several preinstalled settings. You’re best to leave 
this one alone unless you have a good reason.
 
✓ The Log Me In Automatically control — If this is checked, you won’t be 
prompted for a password each time the Eee PC starts up. If you keep 
sensitive information on your mini-laptop, I recommend leaving this 
option unchecked.
 
✓ The Turn Off Display After 5 Minutes of Inactivity check box — If you 
haven’t used the keyboard or touchpad for five minutes, the screen goes 
black. Brush the touchpad or press any key (Esc is always a good one), 
to turn the monitor back on.
Adding favorites
I’m going to jump out of the desktop Settings tab for a moment and talk 
about the Favorites tab, because it also has to do with personalizing your Eee 
PC (plus there’s not enough in this tab to devote an entire chapter to it).
The default content of the Favorites tab has two icons (as shown in 
Figure 9-4). The icons include
 
✓ ASUS.com — Runs the browser and takes you to the ASUS Web site 
(if you’re connected to the Net).
 
✓ Customize — Runs a program that allows you to copy icons from other 
preinstalled programs to the Favorites tab.
 
Figure 9-4: 
The 
Favorites 
tab.
 

151
 Chapter 9: Configuring the Eee PC
 
On 901 and later model Eee PCs, ASUS also includes a Suggestion Box icon you 
can click to provide online feedback about your mini-laptop.
The idea is you can keep a collection of commonly used programs in a single 
handy location. For example, if you often find yourself using Documents 
(word processor), File Manager, Web (browser), and Solitaire, add them to 
Favorites so you don’t need to jump between desktop tabs. (The program 
icons still remain in their original tabs; a copy of the icon is just added to 
Favorites.)
The Customize program displays a list of preinstalled program icons (see 
what I mean in Figure 9-5). Several commands are available.
 
✓ Select a program name in the Available Favorites list and then click Add 
to move the program to the Current Favorites list. The program then 
appears in the Favorites tab.
 
✓ Select a program name in Current Favorites and click the Up or Down 
buttons to change the order of appearance in the Favorites tab.
 
✓ Use the Remove button to remove a selected Current Favorites file from 
the Favorites tab.
 
The Remove button does not uninstall the program. It only removes the icon 
from the Favorites tab.
Click OK to save your changes. The Favorites tab is now updated with the 
program icons you added or removed.

Changing the Date & Time
If you travel with your Eee PC, you may want to update the current time 
(and possibly date) before or after you reach your destination.
Click the Date & Time icon in the Settings tab to set the current day and 
time. A window is displayed with a calendar, clock, and command buttons 
(as shown in Figure 9-6).
 
Figure 9-6: 
Setting the 
date and

To set the current date
Follow these steps to set the date on your Eee PC:
 
1. Use the blue arrows above the calendar to scroll through the months 
and years.
 
 Single arrows move forward or backward a month; double arrows move 
forward or backward a year.
 
2. Click the current day.
 
3. Click the Apply button to save the changed date.
 
You can use the Date & Time program to scroll through the calendar to 
find what day of the week a date falls on. Find the month and year you’re 
interested in and then click Cancel instead of OK.
To set the current time
Click the digital clock beneath the analog clock hands to set the current time. 
You can either type in a number or use the up and down arrows to increment 
or decrement the current time value (the up arrow advances; the down 
arrow goes back).

4. Click the Time Zone button and select the current time zone (if it’s 
changed).
 
5. Click the Apply button to save the time change.
 
Setting the time and date is pretty straightforward, but if you need additional 
assistance, click the Help button to display online help.
Setting Speaker and Microphone Volume
The Volume icon in the Settings tab controls the speaker and microphone 
volume. Normally this program automatically runs when you start your Eee 
PC, and nothing happens when you click it. (You’ll know if the program is 
running if a speaker icon appears in the taskbar.)
Click the speaker icon in the taskbar to display volume controls as shown in 
Figure 9-7.
Use the vertical sliders to set speaker (labeled Volume) and microphone 
(labeled Mic) volume levels. Move the slider up to increase the volume. Move 
the slider down to decrease the volume.

Moving the cursor over the speaker icon in the taskbar shows the current 
volume level setting.
 
✓ Click the Mute checkboxes to turn the speaker or microphone off.
 
✓ Use the horizontal slider to control speaker balance. The default setting 
provides an equal amount of sound to each speaker, but you can change 
the value to add more to the left or right.
If the speaker icon doesn’t appear in the taskbar, click the Volume icon in the 
Settings tab.
Configuring Printers
Clicking the Printers icon runs a program that enables you to add and 
configure printers to use with your Eee PC. (If you’re interested in connecting 
to a shared Windows printer, I talk more about this is Chapter 3.)
In this section, I give you a quick overview on how to install and configure 
printers. For more information, refer to the online help by clicking the Help 
button at the bottom of the Printers window (as shown in Figure 9-8). Also, 
be sure to read the “Linux and printers” sidebar.
Adding and configuring printers
To install a printer to use with your Eee PC, follow these steps:
Linux and printers
Not all printers will work with Linux. Because 
Microsoft has been the dominant provider of 
operating systems over the years, a number 
of printer manufacturers have elected only to 
provide Windows drivers (the software that 
interfaces a printer with a computer). That’s 
changing with the growing popularity of Linux 
and Macs, but there are many printers out there 
that you won’t be able to use with your Eee PC.
The best Web site to see if your printer is com-
patible with Linux is the Linux Foundation’s 
OpenPrinting Database at http://open
printing.org/printer_list.cgi.
Enter a manufacturer and model number to find 
out about compatibility.
You can also check the back of your Eee PC 
user manual, which contains a list of compatible 
printers or the EeeUser.com Wiki (http://
wiki.eeeuser.com), which maintains a 
hardware compatibility list.

155
 Chapter 9: Configuring the Eee PC
 
1. Click the Add… button.
 
 This launches the Add Printer Wizard, which steps you through the 
process.
 
2. Select Local printer or Network printer and click Next.
Adding a local printer
If you decide to add a local printer (which you can connect to the Eee PC 
with a USB cable), follow these steps:
 
1. Give the printer a name and choose which port to use (USB Printer is 
selected by default).
 
2. Choose the printer manufacturer and model from the drop-down lists. 
The correct driver is selected for you.
 
 The Eee PC has a built-in database of compatible printers and drivers. If 
your printer isn’t shown, you can try a similar model or Generic.
 
3. Optionally print a test page and click Finish.
Adding a network printer
If you elected to add a network printer, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a network type (Windows, Unix, or other), provide a printer 
name, and specify a printer path (use the Browse button).
 
2. Choose the printer manufacturer and model from the drop-down lists. 
The correct driver is selected for you.
 
 If your printer isn’t shown, try a similar model or Generic.
 
3. Optionally, print a test page and click Finish.

156
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Configuring a printer
After you have added a printer, it appears in the list of installed printers 
(as shown in Figure 9-8). Four buttons under the list enable you to configure 
the printers.
 
✓ Add — Adds a printer, as I just described.
 
✓ Delete — Uninstalls the selected printer and removes it from the list.
 
✓ Properties — Displays a dialog box with settings for the selected 
printer, including name, paper size, ink color, and other printer-specific 
options.
 
✓ Set as Default — If you have multiple printers installed, this option sets 
the selected printer as default when you print. The default printer has a 
checkmark on its icon.
If your printer doesn’t work
If you can’t get a printer to work with your Eee PC (because of compatibility 
or other issues), here are my suggestions:
 
✓ Ask for help on the EeeUser.com forums (http://forum.eeeuser.
com) — Mention the printer model and what type of problems you’re 
having. Before posting the query, be sure to do a quick search for 
mention of your printer in the forums — to see if anyone has already 
asked the same question and had it answered.
 
✓ Print on another computer — Copy the file you want to print onto a 
USB thumb drive or SD card and print it on another computer with 
a printer that works. This is a low-tech, but effective solution.
 
 Honestly, getting certain printers to work on the Eee PC can be a time-
consuming challenge, even for a Linux guru. Sometimes it’s best to go 
with the path of least resistance.
 
✓ Purchase a compatible printer — Check the back of your Eee PC user 
manual for a list of compatible printers (unfortunately, many of these 
printers are fairly old, so a number of them are discontinued). Also 
check the EeeUser.com Wiki for a hardware compatibility list, based on 
user experiences (http://wiki.eeeuser.com/#compatibility_
information).
Changing Touchpad Settings
Clicking the Touchpad icon runs a program for changing touchpad settings. 
The Touchpad Preferences window, as shown in Figure 9-9, has four tabs. 
The following sections explain what each tab contains.

157
 Chapter 9: Configuring the Eee PC
 
Figure 9-9:

options.
 
General
The General tab contains two controls:
 
✓ Enable Touchpad — Make sure this is checked. If it’s not, you won’t 
be able to use your touchpad.
 
✓ Sensitivity — Set’s how much pressure the touchpad requires to work. 
High means lightly touching the surface moves the cursor. Low means 
you must press down harder on the surface.
 
If your cursor doesn’t seem to be responsive, always try changing the 
sensitivity setting.
Tapping
The Tapping tab has three controls that, you guessed it, allow the touchpad 
to support tapping. When tapping is enabled, the touchpad serves as a 
mouse button. Tap once to single-click. Tap twice to double-click.
 
✓ Enable Tapping — When checked, this option allows you to tap the 
touchpad to emulate mouse clicks.
 
✓ Tapping Time — This option sets the time duration for a recognized 
mouse click. Short is a fast tap. Long is a slow tap.
 
✓ Enable Faster Tapping — Check this box if you tap really fast, and your 
taps aren’t being recognized.

158
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Scrolling
Normally, to scroll in a window, you move the cursor on a scrollbar and click. 
The Eee PC also supports using the touchpad to scroll. Just place your finger 
on the edge of the touchpad and drag up or down. Three types of scrolling 
are available on the touchpad, vertical, horizontal, and circular.
 
Although most programs support vertical scrolling, not all programs support 
horizontal and circular scrolling.
Vertical scrolling
When Enable Vertical Scrolling is checked, you can drag up or down in the 
right corner of the track pad to scroll a window. A slider control enables you 
to specify drag speed.
Horizontal scrolling
Enable Horizontal Scrolling is turned off by default, but if you check this 
option, you can horizontally scroll a window by dragging on the bottom edge 
of the touchpad. You can also control drag speed.
Circular scrolling
Circular scrolling allows you to scroll long distances with fewer motions. You 
scroll in a circular motion around the touchpad edges. For example, to scroll 
up, start dragging at the bottom of the touchpad and continue around the 
edges in a counter-clockwise motion. (If you have an iPod, circular scrolling 
is like using the click wheel.) Set where on the touchpad you want to start 
your circular scrolls.
 
Although it’s possible to enable all three types of scrolling at once in the 
Preferences window, that doesn’t mean they will all work at the same time. For 
example if circular scrolling is checked, horizontal scrolling won’t work even 
though it is enabled.
Edge
These options tell the touchpad how to behave when you drag along the 
edges. You can specify to scroll or treat dragging along the edge as 
cursor movements. (Some Eee PC models also don’t include the Edge tab, 
incorporating these options into other tabs.)

 Chapter 9: Configuring the Eee PC
 
On Eee PC models that have multi-touch touchpads, an additional tab named 
Two Finger appears. Here you can change multi-touch settings.
Using the Disk Utility
The Disk Utility isn’t really a disk utility in the true sense of the word. When 
you click this icon, a window is displayed that shows how much space is 
available on your drive (as shown in Figure 9-10). System, Used, and Available 
space are the options presented in several different ways.
On Eee PCs with a single internal drive, the Extra Drive tab doesn’t provide 
any information; even if you have an SD card inserted or a USB thumb or hard 
drive connected. This is normal behavior.

Running Diagnostic Tools
The Diagnostic Tools program provides detailed information about your 
Eee PC and has a series of hardware tests to ensure everything is working 
properly.
The three options in the program are System Info, System Test, and Contact 
Us. Click an associated icon (as shown in Figure 9-11) to run that option. Here 
is a brief description of each option.

System Info
System Info (which is displayed by default), contains all sorts of information 
about your Eee PC. A general summary is shown, but you can also click the 
Details button to get more in-depth information on various system hardware 
components.
System Test
System Test (as shown in Figure 9-12) offers a variety of hardware tests. If 
you think something is wrong with a hardware component, click its icon to 
run the test. You can also click the Test All button to run the entire series 
of hardware tests.
Each of the tests gives you instructions before running and provides 
feedback with test results.

Contact Us
The last Diagnostic Tools option is Contact Us. Two choices are available:
 
✓ View Support Website — Click this button to load the browser and visit 
the ASUS support site. You need to be connected to the Internet. This 
may give you a solution to your problem.
 
✓ Send Feedback with System Log — If you’re still having problems, 
click this button to send an e-mail to ASUS support. This launches 
Thunderbird, where you can compose a message describing your issue. 
A log file is attached to the message with system details that can help 
support staff diagnose your problem. (If you haven’t used Thunderbird, 
the first time you use it, a wizard steps you through setting up the 
program.)
Changing Settings for Presentations
The Desktop Mode icon’s name and appearance are a little deceiving. This 
program has nothing to do with the Linux desktop, but instead relates to 
using the Eee PC with an external monitor that’s connected to the VGA port. 
Click this icon to configure settings when you’re giving presentations and 
using a projector or monitor. The External Display program is shown in 
Figure 9-13.

162

settings for 
using an

If your Eee PC isn’t hooked up to an external monitor, a number of options are 
grayed out.
 
Always connect the external monitor or projector first, turn the power on, and 
then boot the Eee PC.
Three self-explanatory External Device radio buttons control what gets 
displayed where:
 
✓ View both external and internal displays.
 
✓ View external display only.
 
✓ View internal display only.
Select which you prefer and click Apply.
 
You can rotate through these display settings by pressing Fn+F5 (there’s 
a picture of a monitor on the F5 key as a reminder). This key combination can 
be used at any time even if the External Display program isn’t running.
In addition to the display settings, there are two radio buttons for Resolution:
 
✓ Automatically adjust — The default setting. Use this unless you’re 
having problems with the screen resolution on the external display 
device.
 
✓ Manual — Allows you to manually set one of several predefined 
monitor sizes.
Click the Apply button to change the settings and then OK to exit the 
program.

 Chapter 9: Configuring the Eee PC
Adding and Removing Software
Add/Remove Software is ASUS’s program for providing Eee PC software 
updates. When you run the program, it connects to an ASUS server over the 
Internet, checks which versions of software you currently have installed, and 
sees if any new versions are available. It also displays any new ASUS software 
that’s available for the Eee PC.
 
This process can take awhile, depending on the current ASUS server load.
After the program is done checking, it displays a tabbed window similar to 
the Linux desktop. Click a tab to display updated programs that are available. 
For example, clicking the Internet tab (as shown in Figure 9-14) displays a list 
of updated Internet programs that you can download and install.
 
The Remove button doesn’t allow you to remove preinstalled software. It only 
removes the update and then rolls back to the original version. You cannot 
use the program to remove preinstalled software.
So far, so good. But pay attention now please. Some users report that 
after running the program to update their software, desktop icons have 
disappeared and some programs no longer work correctly.
If you’re going to use the Add/Remove Software program, please read 
Chapter 12 where I discuss this issue in depth and offer solutions for getting 
around potential installation and upgrade woes.

Using VoiceCommand
If you’re a fan of Star Trek and always wanted to tell your computer what to 
do, the Eee PC can fulfill your fantasies of sitting in the captain’s chair on the 
Enterprise, barking out orders.
When you click the VoiceCommand icon in the Settings tab, it installs 
a small icon in the taskbar (it’s a little hard to make out what it is, perhaps a 
tiny speaker). Right-click the icon to display a pop-up menu as shown in 
Figure 9-15.
Select Enable to turn on a feature called VoiceCommand. VoiceCommand 
runs certain programs when you speak out loud. For example if you say, 
“Computer Clock,” the Eee PC replies “Clock” and then runs the world time 
clock program. All the voice commands are shown in the pop-up menu.
 
Make sure the microphone is enabled. You also may need to adjust the mic 
volume depending on how loud you speak and how far away you are from the 
mini-laptop.
Select Disable in the pop-up menu to turn off VoiceCommand or select Quit 
to exit the program.
VoiceCommand leans more toward geeky fun than a productivity tool, and is 
great to impress your friends with (especially fans of Kirk and Spock).
 
Figure 9-15:

165
 Chapter 9: Configuring the Eee PC
 
For 901 and later model Eee PCs, ASUS uses a different voice recognition pro-
gram called Dr. Eee. It serves the same purpose as the earlier VoiceCommand, 
but has a different interface. Check the online help for more information on 
using the program.
Keeping the Viruses Out
When you click the Anti-Virus icon (don’t you just love those little bugs and 
the shield), a program called Clam AntiVirus runs. Popularly known as 
ClamAV, this is an open-source, anti-virus utility (you can learn more about 
the program at: www.clamav.net/).
But I thought Linux didn’t get viruses?
So what’s the deal with including an anti-virus program with the Eee PC? 
You may have heard you don’t need to worry about viruses and malicious 
software if you’re running Linux. Only Windows users require protection 
software.
This is true to an extent; at present, there are only a few known Linux viruses 
compared to an estimated several hundred thousand or more viruses that 
plague Windows users. But here are two good reasons why the Eee PC has an 
anti-virus utility:
 
✓ Insurance for the future — As Linux becomes more popular, there’s a 
possibility the platform could be targeted by malicious programmers. 
ClamAV adds a level of security insurance for the future.
 
✓ Windows — Because many people use SD cards and USB thumb drives 
to exchange files between their Eee PC and primary Windows computer, 
there’s always a chance of an infected file. Although a Windows virus 
shouldn’t affect a Linux computer (there are a handful of cross-platform 
viruses out there, but not enough to worry about), it’s nice for the Eee 
PC to be able to catch a problem file and let you know about it.
Performing a scan
To check for viruses, while in the Scan tab (as shown in Figure 9-16), follow 
these steps:

166
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
Figure 9-16: 
ClamAV 
anti-virus 
utility.
 
 
1. Click the blue folder button to the left of the Scan button to select a 
location to scan.
 
 This opens a dialog box where you can select a file, directory, or a 
device to scan. USB drives and SD cards should appear in the User 
directory.
 
2. Select the location and click OK.
 
3. Click the Scan button to search for viruses.
 
 After a scan starts, you can Pause or Cancel.
 
Before you perform a scan, click the Update tab and download the latest 
version of the virus database.
ClamAV then starts scanning. At the bottom of the window, the name of the 
file currently being scanned is shown. Above that is the Scan Summary, with 
information about the number of files that have been scanned and how many 
(if any) were infected.
Complete online help is available for ClamAV. To view it, select Anti-Virus 
Handbook in the Help menu.
 
For 901 and later model Eee PCs, instead of ClamAV, ASUS uses a commercial 
anti-virus program called NOD32 (see: www.eset.com). NOD32 is more of a 
full-featured anti-virus utility compared to ClamAV. Check the online help for 
more information on using this program.

 Chapter 9: Configuring the Eee PC
Shutting Down
The Instant Shutdown icon sounds like it’s something special, but in reality 
it just launches the shutdown program (as shown in Figure 9-17). This is 
identical to clicking the Shut Down icon (red circle at the far right) in the 
Linux taskbar. (I tell you everything you need to know about shutting down 
in Chapter 2.)
 
Figure 9-17: 
Shut Down 
options.
 
More Settings icons
On the 901 and later model Eee PCs you might 
find some additional icons in the desktop 
Settings tab. Added programs include:
 ✓ Bluetooth — On models with built-in 
Bluetooth, this utility makes Bluetooth con-
nections, transfers files, and configures the 
wireless card.
 ✓ EeeAP — ASUS makes an 802.11 wireless 
access point, and if you have one, this is the 
configuration program to use with it.
 ✓ Instant Key — On models that have con-
figurable Instant Keys, use this program to 
associate a program with a key. When you 
press the key, the program runs.
For more information on these programs, 
refer to your user manual or consult the 
online help.

Getting Help
In This Chapter
▶ Using Eee PC online help
▶ Navigating the ASUS support Web site
▶ Joining the EeeUser.com community
T
he Eee PC is pretty easy to use, but sooner or later you’re going to 
have a question about one thing or another. You’ll likely consult the user 
manual first (as well as this book, I hope), but what if you can’t find what 
you’re looking for? Where do you turn next?
That’s what this chapter is all about. I list and describe various Eee PC help 
and support resources.
I start by covering how to use Help tools that come installed on the Eee PC — 
actually there are more than meet the eye. My primary focus is on Linux 
models, but I also briefly touch on Eee PCs running Windows XP.
I then continue by telling you where to go on the Internet to get answers to 
all of your Eee PC questions. I describe what the ASUS support site has to 
offer (including how to use it), and then I steer you toward a Web-based 
community that is the best and most comprehensive source of Eee PC infor-
mation on the planet (covering all models of Eee PCs, including those running 
default Xandros Linux, Windows XP, and even other versions of Linux).
So if you have a burning Eee PC question right now, or want to know where to 
turn in the future, follow me to the answers.
Using Eee PC Online Help
You can get help on Eee PCs in a number of ways, many of which come 
installed with Xandros Linux. Help is scattered throughout the user interface 
in some obvious and not so obvious places. Here is where to look.

170
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
If you lost your printed user manual, read the upcoming section on using the 
ASUS support site, where I tell you how to download Eee PC manuals in PDF 
format. You can then keep a copy on your mini-laptop for handy reference.
Desktop online help
The most obvious source of help is the Help command at the top of the Linux 
desktop (it’s to the far right of the program category tabs). When you click 
Help, the Web browser is loaded with a file that contains basic instructions 
for using the desktop and preinstalled programs.
At the top of the Help page (as shown in Figure 10-1) are a series of tabs, just 
like those that appear on the desktop.
Click a tab to get information about programs that are associated with the 
tab. A general description and brief instructions for using the program are 
included. A fair amount of information is included in each tab, so you’ll need 
to scroll down to view it all.
 
The desktop online Help covers a lot of material that isn’t discussed in the 
printed user manual. You may want to print the pages. If your Eee PC isn’t 
connected to a printer, use the Save Page As… command in the browser File 
menu and save the Help file to a USB thumb drive or SD card. You can then 
open the file with the Web browser on your desktop PC and print the page. 
When you print or save, remember that a separate help page is associated 
with each desktop tab.
 
Figure 10-1: 
Linux Eee 
PC desktop

171
 Chapter 10: Getting Help
E-book online help
An identical version of the desktop Help is also available as an e-book. To 
view it, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Work tab, run the File Manager.
 
2. Open the My Documents folder.
 
3. Open the My Ebooks folder.
 
4. Double-click the manual.CHM file to start the e-book reader and view 
the file (as shown in Figure 10-2).
 
If the .CHM file isn’t in the EBooks folder, you can download it from http://
support.asus.com/download.
There are several advantages to accessing desktop Help as an e-book:
 
✓ The text appears in a larger font than in the browser and is easier 
to read.
 
✓ The e-book reader offers options for configuring viewing preferences.
 
✓ The e-book reader remembers what you were viewing when you close 
the program and displays that text when you run the program the 
next time.

172
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
There is no vertical scroll bar in the e-book reader. Use the up and down 
arrow keys to move up and down through the text.
Eee PC Tips
On the far right side of the taskbar is the Eee PC Tips icon which looks like a 
yellow smiley face — check out Chapter 2 for more on what the taskbar icons 
look like and do. When you click this icon, a series of tips are displayed in the 
Web browser (as shown in Figure 10-3). These are common ASUS support 
questions with brief answers.
Online program help
Always check to see if there is a Help menu in the program you’re using. 
The amount and quality of online help varies from one program to another. 
Additionally, an Internet connection may be required to use this help 
because selecting a Help menu item might load a support Web site.
 
In this book, I mention additional information sources for many of the prein-
stalled Linux programs. Read the appropriate chapter where I discuss a 
program to see if any Web-based references may be of help. (For example if 
you want to learn more about the games that come with the Eee PC, check out 
Chapter 8, which has lots of Web links relating to the games.)

taskbar.
 

173
 Chapter 10: Getting Help
KDE and Linux help
The Eee PC uses a version of Linux with the KDE user interface. The default 
Linux desktop is a very simplified user interface and doesn’t offer the full 
power of KDE. (In Chapter 19, I describe how you can enable Advanced 
Mode, which makes the complete KDE user interface, desktop, and programs 
available.)
If you’re new to Linux and want to learn more about the operating system 
itself and KDE, you can run a program called Help Center. This is a 
complete online help system for the KDE interface, KDE programs, and 
UNIX commands. This is a great way to see what KDE and Linux are all about. 
Here’s how to run the program:
 
1. Press Ctl+Alt+T.
 
 This brings up a Linux command-line console. I tell you everything you 
need to know about using the console in Chapter 20.
 
2. Type khelpcenter.
 
 Since Linux is case sensitive, make sure to capitalize the word exactly as 
you see it here and then press Enter after you’re done typing. (If you 
enter a command and get a command not found error message, you’ve 
either made a typo or a letter is incorrectly capitalized. Try again.)
 
3. Search for the help topic you’re interested in.
The Help Center is shown in Figure 10-4. It’s intuitive to use, but here are a 
few general instructions:
 
✓ The panel on the left is an index of help information, Click categories 
and topics to display them in the right panel.
 
✓ Use the Search icon (the magnifying glass) in the toolbar to search 
for text.
 
✓ Click the Glossary tab to display a complete glossary of KDE and 
Linux terms.
When you’re done browsing through the help pages, in the Help Center File 
menu, select Quit and then close the Linux console window.
 
Help Center is also displayed when you use the Help menu in some prein-
stalled Linux programs, such as File Manager.

Using the Internet to Get Help
If the user manual, online help, or even this book (perish the thought) 
doesn’t answer your burning Eee PC question, then it’s time to fire up your 
browser and head to the Internet. I recommend two sites for all Eee PC 
models, regardless of the operating system they run.
Eee PC Windows online help
Compared to the Linux models, ASUS doesn’t 
add much Eee PC–specific online help to its 
mini-laptops that come with Windows XP. That 
makes sense, because Windows is so widely 
used, and people are more familiar with it than 
they are with Linux. The printed manual that 
comes with Windows models gives you enough 
information to get started using your Eee PC. 
From there, you can access the online help that 
comes with programs as well as Windows’ 
built-in help system (click the Start button and 
then select Help and Support).
If your user manual doesn’t answer a Windows-
related Eee PC question, I’d recommend not 
bothering to look in online help, but proceeding 
directly to the EeeUser.com Web site which I 
describe later in this chapter. Here you will find 
forums that deal specifically with Windows 
issues and knowledgeable users willing to help 
answer your questions.

175
 Chapter 10: Getting Help
 
Don’t feel obligated to use your Eee PC to access these sites. In fact, if I’m 
troubleshooting my Eee PC, I’ll use a desktop or laptop PC to browse for 
support information. A larger screen is nice when searching for help, plus I 
can put the mini-laptop next to the bigger computer, which makes it easy to 
follow instructions as I read them.
 
Web sites are always changing; keep that in mind just in case something I 
describe doesn’t match a Web site when you visit. Even if a Web site’s 
appearance is different, you still should have a good idea of how to access 
the information I discuss.
Navigating the ASUS support site
Our first stop is ASUS’s support site at http://support.asus.com/. As 
shown in Figure 10-5, the site has six main sections. To start finding your way 
around, click a section link. Sections include
 
✓ Download — Download file utilities, drivers, software updates, and user 
manuals.
 
✓ FAQ — View frequently asked questions organized by product.
 
✓ Forum — Participate in a support forum for various ASUS products.
 
✓ Member — Join a free membership program for ASUS customers.
 
✓ Registration — Register your product online.
 
✓ Troubleshooting — Look at product troubleshooting information.
You should be primarily interested in the Download, FAQ, and Forum 
sections. After you click one of these section links, specify some product 
information to get to the good stuff. All these sections use the same 
interface to get to the Eee PC department, so . . .
 
✓ In the Select Product drop-down list, choose EeePC.
 
✓ In the Select Series drop-down list, choose Eee PC Series.
 
✓ In the Select Models drop-down list, choose your model (such as Eee PC 
4G/Linux).
A dialog box opens, and asks what operating system you’re running.
Click the Search button to continue and go to the section you’re interested 
in. Here is what’s inside each one.

176
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
 
Figure 10-5: 
The ASUS 
support 
Web site.
 
Download
A new Web page opens with a series of tabs across the top. Click the tab to 
display files in that category. For example the Manual tab displays different 
language user manuals for your Eee PC.
 
Use the Operating System drop-down list box (located above the tabs) to 
display only those files that relate to Linux or Windows XP. This saves you the 
time of going through a long list of all files.
The file list includes the filename, version, date posted, operating system, 
and a description (usually quite terse and often not too helpful).
Beneath each file, different server locations around the world are shown. To 
download a file, select the nearest server, right-click, and then use the pop-up 
menu command to save the link to disk. (If a server is slow or doesn’t 
respond, try another one.)
FAQ
In this section, a list of frequently asked questions about your Eee PC model 
is displayed. When you click a question, a new page opens with the question 
and the reply from ASUS. Use your browser’s Back button to return to the 
FAQ list.

177
 Chapter 10: Getting Help
You can specify the number of questions to appear on the page as well as 
display questions posted within a certain timeframe; such as from the last 
seven days.
 
Just to prepare you, some of the questions and answers aren’t in the most 
fluent English, and you may need to ponder both the question and answer a 
bit to grasp the actual meaning.
Forum
Click the Eee PC forum to view questions and replies users have posted. 
Although this is the official ASUS support forum, if you have a question 
I recommend you post it instead to the unofficial forums at EeeUser.com — 
which is a perfect introduction to the next section.
Community-based help from EeeUser.com
In my humble opinion, the best place to go for Eee PC help is a Web site appro-
priately named EeeUser.com (www.eeeuser.com). This definitive site opened 
for business several months before the Eee PC first hit the store shelves and 
has turned into the destination of choice for Eee PC users all over the world.
This is very much an unofficial site. ASUS doesn’t run it, and its users don’t 
pull any punches when discussing Eee PC pros and cons. Opinions are loudly 
voiced, but practical information and sage wisdom are also gladly shared; 
including an expansive collection of tips, tricks, and techniques.
Two parts of the site are oriented toward support and help: the wiki 
(http://wiki.eeeuser.com) and the forums (http://forum.eeeuser.
com). You can access each one at the top of EeeUser’s main Web page by 
clicking their respective links.
Here is a quick look at what you’ll find.
E-mail support from ASUS
If you can’t find an answer to your question 
after consulting the ASUS support site’s refer-
ences, try the company’s e-mail support ser-
vice. At the top of the main Web page, click 
Support in the menu bar and then choose 
Technical Inquiries.
A new page is displayed, where you enter 
which model of Eee PC you own. You are nicely 
reminded to first check the Download, FAQ, and 
Forum sections to see if your question has 
already been answered. If not, at the bottom of 
the page is a link named Technical Inquiry Form. 
Click it, fill in the form describing your support 
issue, and click Submit.
ASUS support staff will be in touch with an 
e-mail reply.

Wiki
A wiki is a Web site that allows users to collectively add and edit content. 
Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, is the most well-known wiki (if you’re 
wondering where the word wiki came from, it’s based on wiki wiki, which is 
Hawaiian for rapidly, rapidly).
The EeeUser Wiki (as shown in Figure 10-6) is the go-to place for Eee PC 
information and how-to instruction. The large and comprehensive compila-
tion of content has been assembled by experienced Eee PC users, eager to 
share their knowledge. Wikis are living, growing entities, and new information 
is always being added (and older information tweaked and refined).
There are two basic ways to navigate the wiki:
 
✓ Table of contents: At the right of the page is a Table of Contents 
organized by category (including Basics, Networking, and Installing 
Operating Systems). Click a category to view information associated 
with it.
 
✓ Search: At the top of the page is a text box next to a Search button. Type 
in something you’re looking for and click Search. A list of wiki entries 
that match your search criteria is displayed. Click one that looks like it 
fits the bill.

Wiki.
 

179
 Chapter 10: Getting Help
 
If you are a new Eee PC owner, or even an experienced one, I highly recom-
mend you spend some time reading the Wiki’s Basics and Common Problems 
sections.
Forums
The wiki is a great source of encyclopedic knowledge, but if you’re looking 
for more interactive, real-time help, the place to visit is the Eee PC forums 
(shown in Figure 10-7).
Over 35 forums are devoted to various aspects of the Eee PC. There are 
forums for different models, different operating systems, hardware hacking, 
accessories, and even foreign language forums for non-English speakers 
(Italiano is quite active).
Click a forum to view a list of posted subjects (posts are displayed 
chronologically, with the most recent appearing first) and then click a 
post title to read the complete thread (usually a question and subsequent 
replies).
 
Figure 10-7: 
Eee
User.com 
forums.
 

180
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Some of the forums receive a large amount of daily traffic, and it would take 
days or weeks to read through all the old posts. If you’re looking for specific 
information, instead of scrolling through months of older posts, use the 
Search command at the top of the page. You can enter specific text associ-
ated with a question and get a list of posts that contain that text. For example 
if you wanted to know about connecting your iPod to your new Eee PC, you 
could do a search for iPod.
You don’t need an account to browse through and search the forums (lurking 
is encouraged), but if you want to post a question or a reply, you need to sign 
up for a free account. This is a painless process that you can start by clicking 
Register at the top of the page.
 
Before you post a question, read the wiki and search the forums to see if 
someone else has already asked the same question and had it answered. This 
is simple common courtesy. Although the forum members are friendly, if you 
post a question without doing your homework first, don’t be surprised if you 
get a few grumpy, scolding replies.
 
In addition to the ASUS and EeeUser.com Web sites, a number of blogs are 
devoted to the Eee PC that provide news and general information on using the 
mini-laptop. I share links to my favorite Eee PC blogs in Chapter 23.

number of steps. As the mini-laptop increased in popularity, ASUS decided to 
begin offering models that came installed with Microsoft Windows XP right 
out of the box.
In this chapter, I tell you all about Windows XP and the Eee PC — that has a 
nice ring, doesn’t it? I start off by listing advantages of both Windows and 
Linux — just in case you’re trying to make up your mind which type of Eee PC 
to buy. I then describe what programs you find preinstalled on a Windows 
Eee PC. And I finish up explaining how to replace Linux with a copy of 
Windows on your mini-laptop — including how to slim down the operating 
system to save space and get better performance.
Windows versus Linux
On a number of Eee PC models, you have a choice between preinstalled 
Linux or Microsoft Windows XP operating systems — keep in mind it’s also 
possible to load Windows XP on just about any Eee PC, as I discuss later 
in the chapter. If you’re thinking about getting an ASUS mini-laptop, you need 
to decide which operating system is best for you.

Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
I’m not going to advocate for one system or the other (there are already 
enough flame wars on the Internet about this very subject). Like most things, 
each operating system has its pros and cons. To give you some perspective, 
here are a few key advantages of each.
Windows advantages
 
✓ More familiar user interface
 
✓ More programs available (including specialized applications)
 
✓ Commercial applications tend to have a more polished user interface
 
✓ Better hardware compatibility (especially with printers and scanners)
Linux advantages
 
✓ Free, resulting in a lower price compared to Windows Eee PC — some 
Linux mini-laptops may have more drive capacity than their same-priced 
Windows cousins.
 
✓ Many free, open-source programs (with similar functionality to popular 
Windows applications).
 
✓ More secure (fewer viruses, worms, and Trojans).
 
✓ Better performance on computers with slower processors and less 
memory.
Which to choose?
Because Windows is so widely used and known, much of this book is focused 
on Eee PCs running Linux — most people already know a fair amount about 
Windows. Skimming through the chapters should give you a pretty good idea 
of what using a Linux Eee PC is all about. You can then compare and contrast 
with your own Windows experience to decide which operating system is best 
for you.
If you’re still having trouble making up your mind, here are a few suggestions 
to steer you in the right direction.
Pick Windows if you . . .
 
✓ Have experience with Windows and don’t want to learn the nuances of a 
different operating system’s user interface. (Be aware that the KDE Linux 
interface isn’t really that difficult to use.)
 
✓ Plan on using Windows programs that aren’t available for Linux
 
✓ Have hardware (printer, scanner, and so on) that isn’t compatible 
with Linux.

183
 Chapter 11: Eee PC and Windows XP
 
If you decide a Windows Eee PC is for you, I highly recommend visiting the 
Windows XP section of the EeeUser.com forums located at http://forum.
eeeuser.com/viewforum.php?id=13. There you find lots of information 
and tips for getting the most out of your Windows mini-laptop.
Pick Linux if you . . .
 
✓ Don’t have much computer experience and want a simple-to-use 
computer to perform basic tasks (e-mail, Web browsing, and word 
processing).
 
✓ Like the idea of free, open-source software.
 
✓ Are technically inclined — you don’t need to be a techie to use a Linux 
Eee PC, but being a little more technical just makes it easier to do 
advanced procedures at times.
 
If you buy a Linux Eee PC and have an old copy of a Windows XP installation 
disc lying around, it’s fairly easy to replace Linux with Windows — and then 
restore Linux later if need be. Conversely, if you purchase a Windows Eee PC, 
you can replace the operating system with Linux — and reinstall Windows 
down the road.
Linux, Xandros, KDE, and Windows
On most Eee PC models, you have a choice 
between Linux and Microsoft Windows operat-
ing systems. Here’s a little more information 
about your operating system options.
There are a number of Linux distributions — 
distros if you want to sound clued in. You may 
have heard or Ubuntu, Fedora (formerly RedHat), 
PCLinuxOS, or Slackware; to name a few. 
A company, organization or group of people 
creates a distribution based on a version 
of a common Linux kernel. It includes various 
packages and software. The distribution is 
packaged up and then released on CD-ROM, 
DVD, or for download. (Head over to www.
linux.org to learn more about all the 
different distributions.)
ASUS uses a Linux distribution called Xandros, 
optimizing and customizing it for the Eee PC. 
Xandros (www.xandros.com) is based on a 
core distro named Debian. It uses a modified 
version of KDE (www.kde.org) as its graphi-
cal user interface. Linux, which is based on 
UNIX, started out as a command-line operating 
system. In an effort to modernize Linux with a 
desktop, windows, and menus, two graphical 
user interface projects were started: KDE and 
Gnome (www.gnome.org). Both generally 
work the same, but have a slightly different 
look-and-feel and associated programs. KDE is 
Windows-like; Gnome is more Mac-like. A Linux 
distribution typically uses either KDE or Gnome 
as its user interface.
For Windows models, Windows XP is used — it 
doesn’t make sense to use Vista on the mini-
laptop because the latest version of Windows 
requires a lot of system resources. Microsoft 
was planning on officially stopping distribution 
of XP at the end of June, 2008, but because of 
the growing mini-laptop market, it elected to 
continue making it available to manufacturers 
of small PCs.

184
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Preinstalled Windows XP
If you purchase an Eee PC that has Microsoft Windows XP preinstalled, 
ASUS has added a few features in addition to the programs, accessories, and 
utilities that normally come with the operating system.
 
Be sure to check out Chapter 14, where I describe a number of free Windows 
programs you can download that are well-suited for the Eee PC. 
Here is a brief summary of the preinstalled programs you find when you start 
your Windows XP Eee PC:
 
✓ Acrobat Reader — The ubiquitous utility for viewing PDF files.
 
✓ ASUS Update — A program for updating the Eee PC’s BIOS.
 
 If you update the BIOS, be sure to have a fully charged battery and the 
mini-laptop plugged into an electrical outlet. If you lose power midway 
through a BIOS upgrade (or something goes wrong), there’s a good 
chance you can turn your mini-laptop into a paperweight. I recommend 
updating the BIOS if you are experiencing a problem that only a newer 
version of the BIOS will fix, or if there is a significant new feature in a 
later BIOS release that you really need. Other than those two occasions, 
I say if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
 
✓ Eee PC Tray — This utility is accessed in the Windows system tray. 
With it you can change screen resolution, change the resolution of an 
external monitor or media projector, and enable/disable the WiFi card, 
Web cam, and Bluetooth (on models with the wireless service built in).
 
✓ Ethernet Utility — This program is for configuring the Ethernet 
network card.
 
✓ Instant Key (on some models) — A utility for configuring two Instant 
Keys (above the function keys) to run user-defined programs. By 
default these two keys launch Super Hybrid Engine and Skype.
 
✓ InterVideo DVD XPack (on some models) — A simple media and 
DVD player.
 
✓ Microsoft Works — This is a basic business suite of programs (word 
processor, spreadsheet, database, and calendar). The programs 
are fairly underpowered and I’d recommend uninstalling Works to 
save drive space and replacing it with OpenOffice (www.openoffice.
org) — if your mini-laptop also came with Star Suite, use it instead. 
You can find out more about Microsoft Works at www.microsoft.com/
PRODUCTS/works/default.mspx.

185
 Chapter 11: Eee PC and Windows XP
 
✓ OS Cleaner (on some models) — A utility that deletes the contents of 
various system directories to save drive space.
 
✓ Outlook Express (on some models) — A reduced-feature version of 
Microsoft’s Outlook e-mail client. (I recommend using Thunderbird for 
your e-mail program at www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/.)
 
✓ Skype — The popular instant messaging and video conferencing pro-
gram. If you don’t have a Skye account, register for a free one before 
using (www.skype.com).
 
✓ Star Suite (on some models) — Star Suite is a commercial version of 
OpenOffice from Sun Microsystems — check out Chapter 5 for more on 
OpenOffice, which runs on both Linux and Windows. To learn all about 
Star Suite, visit www.sun.com/software/staroffice/index.jsp.
 
✓ Super Hybrid Engine (on some models) — A program that changes 
the clock speed of the processor in order to increase battery life. Super 
Performance mode runs at the highest processor speed. The other 
settings lower the clock speed, resulting in longer battery life.
 
✓ U1 Utility (on some models) — An application for configuring a USB 
Skype phone sold by ASUS.
 
✓ YoStore (on some models) — An online data storage service. If your Eee 
PC comes with this feature, activate it with a code found in your user 
manual. After you register, a virtual disk drive icon is created in the My 
Computer directory. You can use the virtual drive to transfer files 
between your mini-laptop and an Internet-hosted server.
 
Consult your user manual and online help for more information on all these 
programs and how to use them.
The Windows support DVD
In addition to preinstalled programs, your 
Windows XP comes with a support DVD. The 
DVD contains an image of the operating system, 
in case you need to restore it — I tell you how 
to reinstall Windows in Chapter 18. The disc 
also has copies of various programs, drivers, 
and utilities. The drivers, which are preinstalled 
on your Eee PC, are essential for hardware 
components such as the monitor, touchpad, 
Web cam, and network cards to work under 
Windows.
You need an external USB DVD drive to use the 
disc — I discuss selecting a drive in Chapter 15. 
Normally, the setup program automatically runs 
when you insert the support disc in the drive. If 
it doesn’t, in Windows Explorer, look for a file 
named AsSetup.exe and double-click it. This 
runs the setup program. Select which drivers, 
utilities, or programs you’d like to install. I dis-
cuss using the AsSetup program in the section 
“Installing Windows on a Linux Eee PC.”

186
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Installing Windows on a Linux Eee PC
If you have a Windows XP Home installation CD-ROM from a computer you’re 
no longer using, you can install the Microsoft operating system on a Linux 
Eee PC (as shown in Figure 11-1).
 
You need an installation disc with the Windows setup program. Some PCs 
come with CD-ROMs that contain a drive image of the operating system. If 
you need to reinstall Windows, the image is written to your hard drive instead 
of using the Microsoft installation program. You can’t use a manufacturer-
provided CD that contains a drive image to install Windows on your Eee PC.
Installing Windows is fairly easy, although it is a little time-consuming. If, 
after you install the operating system, you don’t like it and decide you want 
Linux back, just use the recovery disc that came with your mini-laptop. I tell 
you how to do this in Chapter 18.
Hardware and software requirements
Before you change operating systems, gather up everything you need. Here 
is a list of the required components for installing Windows XP on your 
mini-laptop.
 
Figure 11-1:

XP running 
on a 4G 
Eee PC that

ran Linux.
 

187
 Chapter 11: Eee PC and Windows XP
Eee PC
The first item on the list is a no-brainer. You can install Windows on any 
model of Eee PC; however, there are a few important things to note.
Even though the Eee PC 2G and 4G models use a 900 MHz Intel Celeron 
processor, they are not running at full speed — the chip speed is reduced to 
571 and 630 MHz respectively; to limit power consumption. The Eee PC 900, 
which uses the same Celeron processor, runs at the full 900 MHz — you can 
optionally lower the processor speed in a BIOS setting to increase battery life.
After installing Windows XP on a 4G, I’ve found its performance isn’t quite as 
snappy as when running the default Xandros Linux. In my opinion, the faster 
processor of the Eee PC 900 (and later models that use an Atom processor) 
makes these mini-laptops a better candidate for installing Windows.
 
It’s possible to boost the processor speed of a 2G or 4G up to 900 MHz using 
a Windows program called eeectl (www.cpp.in/dev/eeectl/) — this is 
known as overclocking. This makes your Eee PC a little faster at the expense 
of shorter battery life and a higher amount of heat generated.
 
If you have a 2G or 4G, one of your biggest limitations is the small amount of 
drive storage space — especially on a 2G. With a little work, you can reduce 
the size of Windows XP to around 400 to 550MB (a normal installation is 
in the 800MB to 1GB range). I discuss slimming down Windows in an upcoming 
section.
DVD/CD Drive
Although it’s possible to install a copy of Windows from an SD card or USB 
thumb drive, it’s much easier to use an external CD or DVD drive, with a 
Windows installation CD — I discuss selecting DVD drives in Chapter 15.
 
If you don’t have an external drive and would rather not purchase one, check 
this Web page for the lowdown on adding Windows XP installation files to an 
SD card: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:installxp.
Windows XP
You need a copy of a Windows XP Home or Professional installation CD. 
This has to be an installation disc that includes at least the Service Pack 2 
updates — the earlier version of XP won’t support connecting an external 
USB DVD drive to the Eee PC.
 
A full Windows install takes up a lot of precious drive space. An alternative is 
to create a customized version of the installation CD with fewer features and 
files. See the “Shrinking Windows with nLite” sidebar for more information.

188
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
Eee PC Support DVD
You also need the support DVD that came with your Eee PC — it contains the 
Windows drivers and utilities for built-in Eee PC hardware. Alternatively, you 
can download the drivers and utilities from the ASUS support Web site 
(http://support.asus.com/download) and then install them.
Installing Windows XP
After you’ve got everything together, it’s time to play operating system 
switcheroo. Here are the steps involved:
 
1. Make sure you’ve backed up any files you want to keep.
 
 Your drive is reformatted during the installation process.
 
2. Connect an external CD or DVD drive to the Eee PC and insert the 
Windows installation disc.
 
3. Turn on your Eee PC.
 
4. Press Esc when the Eee PC startup screen appears.
 
 This displays the boot device selection window.
 
5. Select the USB external drive and press Enter.
 
 The CD boots and the Windows setup program runs. Follow the on-
screen instructions. Be patient, it takes awhile for all the files to load.
 
6. Delete partitions and format the drive as NTFS.
 
 By default, Linux Eee PCs can have up to four drive partitions. You must 
manually delete each partition — follow the on-screen directions. After 
you delete all the partitions, format the drive as NTFS. Setup begins by 
copying files from the installation CD to the internal drive.
 
Some Eee PC models that use Solid State Drive (SSD) technology come with 
two drives. If an Eee PC is advertised as having 20GB of storage, it actually 
may have 4GB on one SSD and 16GB on a second drive. The operating system, 
whether Windows or Linux, resides on the smaller, faster drive. As SSD prices 
fall, I expect ASUS to start using single drives.
That’s pretty much it for installation. Follow the directions and prompts and 
you should have a successful install. Upon completion, the setup program 
reboots the Eee PC, and Windows runs from the internal drive.

189
 Chapter 11: Eee PC and Windows XP
You’re not quite done yet, however. You must still install a few drivers and 
utility programs, which is what I talk about next.
Installing Eee PC drivers
After you’ve installed Windows XP, you must install the Eee PC drivers and 
configuration utilities so the operating system can properly work with the 
mini-laptop hardware — including the Web cam, networking cards, and 
touchpad. These files are on the support DVD (or CD-ROM) that came with 
your Eee PC.
 
If you don’t have the disc or an external drive, you can download the files on 
another PC from http://support.asus.com/download — copy them 
to a USB thumb drive and then install on your mini-laptop. The support site 
contains the latest versions of the drivers and utilities.
Insert the support disc into an external USB drive connected to your Eee PC. 
The ASUS Setup program should automatically run. If it doesn’t, use Windows 
Explorer to locate AsSetup.exe (look in the Bin folder) and run the program.
ASUS Setup, as shown in Figure 11-2, has a tabbed interface. Click a tab to 
display options. You are primarily interested in the Drivers and Utilities tabs.
 
Figure 11-2: 
The ASUS 
Setup pro-
gram on 
the support 
disc.
 

190
Part II: Day to Day with the Eee PC 
You have two choices for installing files from the support disc:
 
✓ Install drivers and utilities individually — Click a single driver or utility 
to install it.
 
✓ Use ASUS InstAll Wizard — This is a program for installing several files 
at once — see Figure 11-3. One version is for drivers and one for utilities. 
Click the wizard to start it, and then check which files you want to 
install. The wizard shows file version numbers and lists files that have 
already been installed.
 
Some drivers and utilities require the Eee PC to be rebooted after installation.
After you have installed the drivers and configuration utilities, your Windows 
Eee PC should be ready to use.
 
Figure 11-3: 
The ASUS 
InstAll 
Wizard lets 
you install 
multiple files 
at once.
 
Optimizing Windows XP for the Eee PC
With limited drive space and not the speediest processor in the world, some 
Eee PC models need all the help they can get when running Windows XP. 
Whether you’re using a mini-laptop that came preinstalled with XP or you 
decided to install your own copy of Windows (I recommend using nLite — 
see the associated sidebar), you can use a variety of methods to free up drive 
space and increase performance.

191
 Chapter 11: Eee PC and Windows XP
Some proven options to consider are
 
✓ Disabling the pagefile (or setting it to a smaller size)
 
✓ Disabling hibernation
 
✓ Removing unneeded Windows programs and services
 
✓ Turning on File Compression
 
✓ Turning off System Restore
 
✓ Turning off indexing
 
✓ Turning off animated user interface elements
For more information about these options (including how-to instructions) 
refer to: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/optimizingwinxp.
 
One of my favorite Web sites for information on tweaking Windows XP to 
improve its performance is appropriately called http://tweakxp.com. 
If you run Windows XP on any computer, not just the Eee PC, I highly 
recommend spending some time at this site.
Shrinking Windows with nLite
nLite (www.nliteos.com) is a slick utility 
for creating your own customized installation of 
Windows XP. You start with a Windows instal-
lation CD, run the nLite program, and then select 
what features and services you want to include. 
This is ideal for reducing the size of XP to shoe-
horn onto a limited capacity Eee PC drive. When 
you’re finished, nLite creates a bootable instal-
lation CD that works just like the original version 
from Microsoft.
When using nLite, it’s easy to get carried away 
when specifying programs and services not to 
include on the installation CD. If you eliminate 
certain things, Windows isn’t going to work 
right (if at all) after you install it on your Eee PC. 
If that happens, go back to the drawing board 
and create a new installation CD — this time try 
not to remove critical components.
To help you figure out what should stay and 
what should go, here’s a link to detailed steps 
(including screenshots) on using nLite to create 
a slimmed down version of Windows XP for the 
Eee PC: www.i64x.com/eeexp.php.

Adding Software 
to the Eee PC

In this part . . .
L
inux versions of the Eee PC come preinstalled with 
just about all the software you need for everyday 
office-type work and for accessing the Internet (whether 
it’s e-mail, Web sites, instant messages, or Skype). But 
many more free, open-source Linux programs are avail-
able that you might be interested in. I begin this part by 
discussing the ins and outs of adding software to a Linux 
Eee PC (it’s a little less straightforward than using 
Windows). I then describe some popular, open-source 
software you may want to consider installing.
For Eee PC Windows XP users, I devote a chapter to what I 
consider are the best free software titles for XP; covering 
Internet, productivity, entertainment, and security 
applications.

Chapter 12
Installing Linux Software
In This Chapter
▶ Fundamentals of Linux software installation
▶ Using the Add/Remove Software utility
▶ Installing programs with Synaptic Package Manager
▶ Command-line installation with Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)
S
o, you decided to go for a Linux Eee PC. Congratulations! You made 
a great choice. However if you’re just getting started, and don’t have 
much Linux experience, installing software on a Linux PC can seem a little 
intimidating compared to doing it on a Windows PC. With Linux you deal with 
things called packages and repositories, decide whether to use something 
known as pinning, and then choose from several installation utilities to do 
the actual downloading and installing.
That all sounds complicated, but in this chapter, I take the mystery and con-
fusion out of installing programs on your Linux Eee PC. I explain fundamental 
installation concepts and give you the pros and cons of using various instal-
lation tools; including the default Add/Remove Software program, Synaptic 
Package Manager, and APT.
By the end of the chapter, you’ll have it all figured out and will be able to con-
fidently install, upgrade, and remove Linux programs from your Eee PC.
Let’s get started with the basics.
Basic Installation Concepts
Before I tell you how to install Linux software on your Eee PC, I want to 
familiarize you with some basic concepts. Linux approaches installation dif-
ferently than does Windows, and it’s important to understand some of the 
differences. Here are a few key terms and concepts:

196
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
 
✓ Package — A package is software (and support files) compressed in a 
single file, using a specific file format. Think of it as a ZIP file with detailed 
installation instructions included. You download a package for a particu-
lar Linux program (or library) that you want to install. Different versions 
of Linux use different package formats. Eee PC packages have a .deb 
(for Debian) file extension. There are other package types, such as .rpm 
(Redhat Package Manager), but you can’t use them with the Eee PC.
 
✓ Package manager — This is a program that installs, upgrades, config-
ures, and removes packages. I describe three package managers you can 
use to manage software on your Eee PC in the next sections.
 
✓ Repository — An Internet server that contains a collection of packages. 
Packages can be downloaded with a package manager or manually trans-
ferred from a Web site or FTP server. I show you how to access reposito-
ries containing Eee PC–compatible software later in the chapter.
 
✓ Pinning — Because various repositories may have different versions of 
the same package, pinning prioritizes which repositories to use when 
downloading. Pinning protects you from accidentally downloading and 
installing packages that might make your system unstable. I explain how 
to pin repositories coming up.
With these concepts in mind, let’s now discuss the different options you have 
for installing and managing software.
Eee PC eccentricities
When it comes to installing new Linux software 
or upgrading existing programs on your Eee PC, 
be aware of a few of its eccentricities. Don’t 
worry about these peculiarities; just recognize 
them for what they’re worth.
 ✓ Limited drive space — Because most Eee 
PC models have considerably less drive 
capacity than a traditional laptop, storage 
space is at a premium. Be aware of avail-
able space to ensure you don’t fill the drive 
up with too many newly installed packages. 
If you run out of space, a package manager 
will tell you. But it’s better to be aware 
ahead of time.
 ✓ UnionFS — Because of UnionFS (which I 
fully describe in Chapter 18), you cannot 
remove programs and operating system 
components that are preinstalled on Linux 
Eee PCs. The operating system and default 
programs are stored on a read-only drive 
partition; which allows F9 system recover-
ies. This means if you update a preinstalled 
program to a new version, you end up with 
two copies — both the old version of the 
program (on the read-only partition) and 
the new version (on the user partition). This 
restricts available drive space even further. 
(It’s possible to remove UnionFS, but this 
is an advanced move, and you’ll lose the 
capability to use F9.)
 ✓ Xandros— The Eee PC uses a variation of 
Xandros Linux. Xandros doesn’t update pack-
ages as often as other Linux distributions,

197
 Chapter 12: Installing Linux Software
Installing and Uninstalling with 
Add/Remove Software
The Add/Remove Software utility in the desktop Settings tab is the ASUS 
default method of installing and uninstalling Eee PC Linux software. It’s a very 
simplified, easy-to-use package manager designed to fit well with the Easy 
Mode user interface. To use the program, make sure you have an Internet 
connection and then follow these steps:
 
1. In the desktop Settings tab, click Add/Remove Software.
 
 A dialog box is displayed as the Eee PC checks for software updates — 
the program compares what is installed on your mini-laptop to what is 
available in the official ASUS repository. This can take awhile, depending 
on the server load.
 
2. Click a tab (as shown in Figure 12-1) to display updated software asso-
ciated with that tab.
 
 Packages that are available for download and installation are organized 
by tab. The name of a program, its version number, and a brief descrip-
tion is shown.
 
Don’t expect to see every Linux program on the planet — far from it actually. 
Add/Remove Software only displays a very small collection of supported pro-
grams that reside in ASUS repositories. Use Synaptic Package Manager or APT 
if you want to install other programs that aren’t listed.
 
Just because Add/Remove Software says a package is available for download 
doesn’t mean you should automatically install it. If you don’t know what it is 
or don’t have a use for it, resist the temptation. The same is true for upgraded 
versions of programs, system files, and the BIOS.
so newer versions of some programs may 
not be available in the Xandros and Eee PC 
repositories. (If you don’t like this, you can 
always install a different version of Linux or 
even Windows.)
 ✓ Add/Remove Software — This is the 
default Linux Eee PC program for installing 
software — it’s located in the Settings tab. 
Some users have reported the utility can 
cause system problems. I provide more 
details in the “Installing and Uninstalling 
with Add/Remove Software” section in this 
chapter.
When it’s time to install software, I like to think 
of the Eee PC as a favorite, semi-eccentric 
uncle. It’s got a few quirks, but overall it’s still 
friendly and fun to be around.

198
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
 
Figure 12-1: 
Add/
Remove 
Software 
tabs and 
programs.
 
Use a command button to carry out an installation action. Command buttons 
are displayed to the right of each package icon. The following buttons are 
available:
 
✓ Open — If multiple packages are present, click the Open button to dis-
play them. You can then use the other buttons listed next for installing.
 
✓ Install — Downloads and installs a package.
 
✓ Update — Updates a previously installed package.
 
✓ Remove — Removes a previously installed package.
 
The Remove button only uninstalls and deletes packages you have personally 
installed. You cannot use it to remove preinstalled programs — if, for exam-
ple, you’re trying to free up space. Default Linux Eee PC programs are kept on 
a read-only partition. New programs and updates are saved to a user partition, 
which is read-write.
Available command buttons depend on the package’s status. For example, if 
a new package is listed that hasn’t been installed yet, the Remove button is 
not shown.
 
Despite its simple-to-use appearance, the Add/Remove Software utility has 
caused grief for some Eee PC users — I’ve personally been burned a time or 
two by the program myself. Here’s what you need to know about it.

199
 Chapter 12: Installing Linux Software
If you visit the EeeUser.com forums, you find a number of posts from users 
who have run into problems using Add/Remove Software. Program icons dis-
appear, programs don’t work correctly, and some users have been forced to 
use F9 to restore their computer to factory settings. (On the other hand, other 
users report successfully using Add/Remove Software with no troubles.)
Because of these currently mixed reviews (with no causes identified or fixes 
suggested), I recommend that if you plan to install or update software on 
your Eee PC, you use Synaptic Package Manager or APT instead of Add/
Remove Software. (Or, don’t worry about updating as I discuss in the “Update 
nation” sidebar.)
If you do decide to use the Add/Remove Software program and your Eee PC 
doesn’t work properly afterwards, here are your options to get things back to 
normal:
 
✓ Try restoring lost program icons with the methods I describe in Chapter 21.
 
✓ Perform an F9 system recovery, which I discuss in Chapter 18. If that 
doesn’t work, you can reinstall the operating system — which I also 
detail in the same chapter. Just remember, all your files will be deleted 
with F9 and DVD recovery methods, so be sure to back them up first.
Update nation
The Internet has fueled a psychosis I like to call 
update-itis. On most PCs, at least a couple of 
times a week, a dialog box appears that pro-
claims, “New version available. Update now?” 
(or something like that). Maybe it’s an operat-
ing system security patch or perhaps a new 
feature update for a program. If you have a Net 
connection and you’re not seeing these dialog 
boxes, it’s probably because at some point you 
elected to automatically install updates, so you 
aren’t constantly bothered by the annoying 
messages.
Most people’s reaction is, “They’re telling me I 
should update, so there must be a good reason 
for it.” Or, “If I don’t update, the hackers will 
get in.”
Call me a Luddite, but I think the “newer must be 
better” attitude is out of control. Most software 
updates contain “nice-to-have” versus “need-
to-have” features. And the bulk of security 
patches are fixes for theoretical versus realis-
tic threats. (I’m convinced the keys to effective 
computer security are simple common sense 
about where you visit and what you download, 
a good firewall, and decent anti-virus software. 
It’s as simple as that.)
How does this apply to the Eee PC? I say if your 
mini-laptop is running and working fine, don’t 
feel compelled to update it (especially with 
Add/Remove Software). Out of the box, I view 
the Eee PC as a computing appliance. And how 
often do you update your TV, cell phone, or 
blender? If it’s not broken, don’t fix it.

Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
Installing with Synaptic 
Package Manager
Synaptic Package Manager, or Synaptic for short (see Figure 12-2), is a user-
friendly, graphical user interface for the command-line Advanced Packaging 
Tool (APT), which I discuss in the next section.
 
Figure 12-2: 
Synaptic 
Package 
Manager.
 
Synaptic displays available packages (based on selected repositories), shows 
which packages your Eee PC has installed, and can automatically download 
and install programs for you. It’s considerably more advanced and powerful 
than the Add/Remove Software utility and doesn’t seem to cause the random 
system problems that some users encounter when installing new software 
and upgrades.
 
For lots more on using Synaptic, because I don’t have the space in this chapter 
to fully cover all its features, check out this how-to: https://help.ubuntu.
com/community/SynapticHowto.
The Easy Mode desktop doesn’t have an icon for Synaptic Package Manager, 
so you start a console session to run it. Here’s how:
 
1. Press Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. Enter sudo synaptic.
 
3. Use Synaptic to install and remove software.

201
 Chapter 12: Installing Linux Software
When Synaptic is loaded, a window like the one shown in Figure 12-2 is 
displayed. The primary elements of the window are:
 
✓ Sections: The Sections list allows you to filter which packages are dis-
played, by type — in Figure 12-2, All, Base System, Communication, and 
so on are sections. By default, All is selected; which shows all packages. 
Select a Section type for the packages you are interested in seeing. For 
example if you select the Editors section, only text editor packages are 
shown.
 
 Click the Status button below the Sections list to display all packages 
currently installed, uninstalled, or those that can be upgraded. Click the 
Sections button to return to the Sections list.
 
✓ Packages: To the right of the Sections list is a list of packages corre-
sponding to the currently selected Section — in Figure 12-2, acpid, acro-
read, and so on are packages. If a package has a filled box to the left of 
its name, it has been installed. Unfilled boxes indicate a package hasn’t 
been installed. All the packages shown in the Add/Remove Software 
program are available, plus more. (If you know the name of a program or 
package, you can search for it to see if it’s available in a repository.)
 
✓ Description: When you select a package, a description is shown in the 
text box below the list of packages. In Figure 12-2, the description for the 
Adobe Reader (acroread) package is displayed.
 
Right-click a package and select Properties to get more detailed information 
about a package, including its size, version, and file dependencies.
Installing and removing packages
The first thing you should always do when running Synaptic is click the 
Reload button in the toolbar. This downloads the latest repository informa-
tion, which is important to keep up-to-date.
If you see a program that you’d like to download in the Packages list, here is 
how to install it on your Eee PC:
 
1. Select the package you want to install.
 
2. Right-click and choose Mark for Installation.
 
3. Click the Apply button in the Synaptic toolbar.
 
 A dialog box appears with information about the package.
 
4. Click Apply in the dialog box.
 
 You may need to hold down the Alt key and drag the cursor because the 
Apply button may appear at the bottom, off the screen.

202
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
Status information is shown as the package downloads, and the program is 
installed. When installation is successfully completed, you can run the new 
(or upgraded) program.
 
In case you’re thinking of installing a program on an SD card to save drive 
space, hold on a minute. If you are using Synaptic or APT, Eee PCs running 
the default version of Xandros Linux cannot install programs to an SD card 
or other external device. It’s possible to mount an SD card as the user parti-
tion, which would allow you to install programs to the card, but this is a fairly 
involved process. If you’re up for the challenge, read this comprehensive 
message thread in the EeeUser.com forums: http://forum.eeeuser.com/
viewtopic.php?id=7694.
 
If you’ve downloaded an Eee PC–compatible package (with a .deb extension) 
from a Web site or FTP server, you can install the program with File Manager. 
Select the .deb file, right-click, and choose Install DEB File from the pop-up 
menu. Just be forewarned that if there are dependent files and libraries not 
included inside the package, they won’t be installed — if you used a package 
manager they would be. If dependent files aren’t installed, the program won’t 
run correctly.
Uninstalling a program with Synaptic follows the same procedure as installing:
 
1. Select the package you want to uninstall.
 
2. Right-click and choose Mark for Removal.
 
3. Click the Apply button in the Synaptic toolbar.
 
4. Click Apply in the dialog box.
 
If you don’t exactly know what a package is and does, don’t remove it. You 
can potentially make your system unstable if you remove something you 
shouldn’t. If that happens, it’s probably time to perform an F9 or DVD restore.
Creating desktop shortcuts
After a package has been installed, create a desktop icon so you can run the 
program (the alternative is to use the console and type the program’s name 
each time you run it).
Unfortunately, Synaptic doesn’t create these icons for you (or add them to one 
of the desktop tabs). Instead you can use SimpleUI Editor or one of the other 
tools I describe in Chapter 21. This is usually a straightforward process.

203
 Chapter 12: Installing Linux Software
 
Because package names aren’t always the same as program names, at times 
finding where a program was installed can be a little challenging — if you 
don’t know the program path, you can’t create a desktop icon for it. Use File 
Manager for your search. Programs are typically installed in the /usr direc-
tory, often in the /bin subdirectory.
Adding a repository
By default, Synaptic only uses official ASUS repositories — which include 
only a small number of ASUS-supported programs. If a program you’d like to 
install isn’t shown in the list of available packages, get it from another Eee 
PC–compatible repository.
To manually add a single repository to Synaptic, make sure you have an 
Internet connection and then do the following:
 
1. In Synaptic’s Settings menu, select Repositories.
 
 The Repositories window is displayed showing a list of currently refer-
enced repositories.
 
2. Click the New button.
 
 Text boxes for filling in information about the repository you want to 
add are displayed (as shown in Figure 12-3).
 
Figure 12-3: 
Synaptic’s 
Repositories 
window —

a new 
repository.
 

204
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
 
3. Enter a URL for the new repository.
 
 For example, http://download.tuxfamily.org/eeepcrepos/.
 
4. Enter the Distribution.
 
 Such as p701.
 
5. Enter the Section.
 
 In most cases, this will be main.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The new repository is added to the list.
Click the Reload button in the Synaptic toolbar to update the list of available 
packages.
When the Repositories window is displayed, repositories that have a check 
box are enabled. Check and uncheck repositories to choose which ones you 
want to access.
 
I show you how to edit several configuration files to add repositories as 
well as pin them (prioritize for downloading) in the section, “Adding More 
Repositories” at the end of the chapter. There I provide instructions for 
including several repositories at once as well as the important instructions for 
pinning.
All about APT
APT stands for Advanced Packaging Tool. This command-line installation util-
ity is found in many Linux distributions — including the Eee PC.
APT isn’t a standalone program, but a collection of function libraries for man-
aging packages. If you’re comfortable using the console, which I describe in 
Chapter 20, APT is a fast and efficient way to install, remove, and update Eee 
PC software.
When you run an APT command, status messages appear in the console. 
During the install process, APT may also ask you to confirm some operations.
 
Synaptic Package Manager is a graphical user interface for APT — it uses APT 
settings files and transparently passes commands to the function library. 
Synaptic is much easier to use because of its point-and-click nature. APT is 
faster.

205
 Chapter 12: Installing Linux Software
Here is a list of some commonly used APT commands that you enter in the 
console:
 
✓ apt-cache search packagename — Searches repositories for a 
named package. Package names and their descriptions are examined for 
a match (searches are not case-sensitive).
 
 If you search for a common term, such as xandros, you need to pipe to 
the Less command to see all the results — if none of that made sense, 
check out Chapter 20.
 
✓ apt-get clean — Cleans up the package cache. Do this every so often 
to save disk space.
 
 Because apt-get commands require administrative privileges, precede 
them with the word sudo. For example, sudo apt-get clean.
 
✓ apt-get install packagename — Installs the named package. If 
other packages are required for the program to run correctly, APT auto-
matically downloads and installs them.
 
✓ apt-get remove packagename — Uninstalls a package.
 
✓ apt-get update — Updates repository information. Always run this 
command before you install a package.
There’s much more to APT, and the best way to come up to speed is to visit 
the official how-to site at www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/.
Adding More Repositories
The ASUS repositories used by Synaptic Package Manager and APT contain 
Eee PC system and program updates and new, officially supported programs 
for the mini-laptop. In keeping with the theme of the Eee PC as a computing 
appliance, these repositories are fairly small — which makes the mini-laptop 
easy to use and support.
However, as you already may know, a large amount of free, open-source 
Linux software is available on the Internet. To download and install these 
programs, you should make additional repositories available to the package 
managers.
Previously in this chapter, I told you how to add a single repository to 
Synaptic. I now want to show you can access the most popular, current Eee 
PC–compatible repositories and ensure that you get the most optimal pack-
age versions by using pinning.

206
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
Adding multiple repositories
Here’s how to add all the current Eee PC–compatible repositories at once. 
After you do this, you can to download many more Eee PC programs with 
Synaptic or APT.
 
1. Start a console session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. Enter sudo kwrite /etc/apt/sources.list.
 
 This opens a configuration file used by both Synaptic and APT with the 
KWrite word processor. The ASUS repositories are listed at the beginning.
 
3. Add the following four lines to the file:
 
deb http://xnv4.xandros.com/xs2.0/upkg-srv2 etch main contrib non-free
deb http://dccamirror.xandros.com/dccri/ dccri-3.0 main
deb http://www.geekconnection.org/ xandros4 main
deb http://download.tuxfamily.org/eeepcrepos/ p701 main etch
 
 These are Web site references and description information for each of 
the repositories. All the repositories contain Eee PC–compatible soft-
ware. Be sure not to accidentally remove the reference to the ASUS 
repository. 
 
 If you don’t feel like risking a typo, go to this link and copy and paste the 
four lines: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/addingxandrosrepos.
 
4. Save the file and quit KWrite.
The four additional repositories are now available to Synaptic and APT.
 
To view all the available packages, click the Reload button in Synaptic or the 
Apt-Get Update command to refresh the repository list. If you get a warning 
message about an invalid public key, just ignore it.
As you hear about new Eee PC–compatible repositories, just add a new entry 
to the sources.list file with a text editor. You can also use Synaptic to add a 
repository as I described earlier, because it uses sources.list.
Pinning repositories
Before you start downloading packages, I highly recommend that you pin 
the repositories — and no, I’m not talking about using your ATM personal 
identification number. Pinning forces the package manager to select specific 
package versions that may be available in different versions on multiple 
repositories. This ensures that packages are not upgraded to versions which 
may conflict with other packages or the system.

207
 Chapter 12: Installing Linux Software
 
If you’re just using the default ASUS repositories, you don’t need to worry 
about pinning.
If repositories aren’t pinned and copies of the same-named package exist 
on several repositories (but with different versions), the package manager 
always chooses the package with the highest version number. This can cause 
problems if a newer package hasn’t been fully tested or perhaps is not com-
patible with the system.
Pinning involves assigning a number to a repository that sets its priority 
when a package is downloaded. A package from a repository with the high-
est number always takes greater download precedence over other reposito-
ries that have the same package. For example, the primary ASUS repository 
should always get the highest pin-priority number.
Here’s how to pin the repositories you just added:
 
1. Start a console session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. Enter sudo kwrite /etc/apt/preferences.
 
 Pinned repositories are set in the file. This command opens the file (or 
creates it if it doesn’t exist).
 
3. Add the pin information.
 
 You must enter quite a bit of text in the file, so instead of listing it here 
and asking you to type it, go to: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/adding
xandrosrepos and copy the pin information to paste into the prefer-
ences file.
 
4. Save the file and exit KWrite.
That’s it. Now when you use Synaptic or APT, you can be assured you always 
get the right package from the right repository.
 
For lots more information on repositories and the Eee PC, spend some time 
reading this excellent how-to at the EeeUser.com Wiki: http://wiki.
eeeuser.com/addingxandrosrepos.
Automating the process
Now that you know how to manually add repositories and pin them, I have 
to tell you that the Tweakeee and Pimpmyeee.sh utilities, which I describe in 
Chapter 21, both have options that add Eee PC–compatible repositories to 
the sources.list file and then pin them.
Why didn’t I tell you earlier, and save you all of that work (and reading)? I’m 
not being mean (really). I just think it’s important to understand how things 
work before you break out the black box tools and put them to work.

208
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
Eee Download Web site
As I put the finishing touches on this chapter, 
a new Web site from ASUS has appeared. 
Dubbed Eee Download (http://eee
download.asus.com), the Web site offers 
yet another alternative for installing programs 
on Linux Eee PCs.
The official ASUS site claims to have over 3,000 
programs that can be installed with just a few 
mouse clicks. A large number of productivity 
applications, games, and utilities are listed and 
described. You need a copy of Eee PC Linux 
version 1.6 or later to use the site, but there’s 
presently little to no information on how 
to upgrade to this release or use the down-
load site.
My guess is Eee Download is currently a work 
in progress, and at this point, it isn’t ready for 
prime time. However I encourage you to pay 
a visit to the site when you read this, to see if 
it’s live and has information on how to use it. 
From initial appearances, Eee Download just 
might provide the easiest and fastest way to 
download and install programs on your Linux 
Eee PC.

I
n Chapter 12, I tell you how to install Linux programs with Synaptic Package 
Manager and APT. But what’s the use of knowing how to install programs if 
you don’t know which cool Linux programs to run on your Eee PC?
That’s what this chapter is about. I tell you about a variety of cool programs 
for your Linux Eee PC. In addition to briefly describing the programs, I also 
tell you how to download and install (and uninstall) them. To be successful at 
this, I make a few assumptions:
 
✓ You’re connected to the Internet.
 
✓ You’ve added the repositories I mention in Chapter 12 (and pinned 
them). It wouldn’t hurt to have skimmed through that chapter so you 
have an idea of how Linux software installation works.
 
✓ You know how to start a console session — just press Ctrl+Alt+T. I show 
you some simple APT commands for installing the programs. Although 
you can certainly use Synaptic, apt-get is faster (and easier to use 
because you don’t have to mess with a bunch of menu items, buttons, 
and lists). To come up to speed on command-line Linux, visit Chapter 20.
 
✓ You understand these programs aren’t supported by ASUS. You should 
go to Web sites and community forums if you have questions.

210
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
After you install a program, you want to create a desktop icon for it. I explain 
how to create program icons in Chapter 21. Or you can always run the pro-
gram by entering its name at the console — I show you the command you 
type to run the program.
Many Linux programs weren’t designed for the tiny 7-inch Eee PC screen. If a 
dialog box appears off the bottom of the screen, hold down the Alt key and use 
the cursor to drag the window up so you can see the rest of the dialog box.
Editing Graphics with GIMP
If you need a little more oomph than the preinstalled paint programs on your 
Linux Eee PC can provide, consider the GIMP. GIMP stands for the Gnu Image 
Manipulation Program (as shown in Figure 13-1). It’s a powerful, raster graph-
ics image editor — think of it as a free, open-source alternative to Adobe 
Photoshop.
If you’re a photographer, be sure to read this how-to for using GIMP with 
the Eee PC to edit RAW format images: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/

To install GIMP: sudo apt-get install gimp.
The GIMP relies on a number of different libraries and support files, so be 
patient as it downloads.
To run GIMP: gimp
To uninstall GIMP: sudo apt-get remove gimp
Cataloging Digital Photos with Picasa
Picasa is a popular program for organizing and editing digital photos and 
graphic images (you can see a sample screen in Figure 13-2). The name is a 
play on the name of the artist Pablo Picasso as well as combining pic (pic-
tures) and casa (Spanish for house). You can catalog, view, and sort images 
by different criteria and perform basic edit functions (red-eye removal, color 
correction, special effects).
A similar Linux program called Gwenview is already installed on your Eee PC — 
I tell you all about it in Chapter 8.
Don’t scan the entire drive when Picasa first starts up. If you do, be prepared 
for a lengthy wait. You’ll be amazed at all the small graphics files (icons, but-
tons, window ornaments, and so on) that are tucked away inside various Eee 
PC directories.
In the Gnus
When you start using Linux, you see a lot of ref-
erences to Gnu. Gnu-this, Gnu-that. Here’s the 
news on all of those Gnus.
GNU (for GNU’s Not Unix) is a UNIX-compatible 
operating system composed of entirely free 
software that dates back to the mid-1980s. 
It was fathered by Richard Stallman, a pro-
grammer and founder of the Free Software 
Foundation (www.fsf.org). In addition to 
the operating system, the GNU Project also 
created a compiler and other utilities. In 1991, 
Linus Torvalds used GNU development tools to 
create the Linux kernel.
GNU is as much a philosophy as it is an expres-
sion of technology, and over the years a number 
of programs have adopted the GNU moniker in 
their names to support and promote the notion 
of free software.
For more on GNU, visit: www.gnu.org.

To uninstall Picasa: sudo apt-get remove picasa
Some Eee PC models might have Picasa pre-installed. If it’s already on your 
mini-laptop, there’s no need to install it again.
Traveling the World with Google Earth
Google Earth (as shown in Figure 13-3) is a free program that displays satel-
lite imagery of the entire planet. You can zoom in on a location and get a 
detailed bird’s-eye view of a place — resolution varies, depending on avail-
able satellite data. It’s an amazing program, kind of like having your own per-
sonal spy satellite, and it is indispensable if you travel with your mini-laptop.

Google Earth is designed to run on at least a 1024-x-768 screen, but still works 
on the Eee PC — performance can be a bit pokey though, considering the Eee 
PC’s relatively under-powered processor.
If, after you install Google Earth, it’s running as slow as molasses, here’s what 
to do:
 
✓ If you have a pre-4.3 version of the program, apply some speed 
patches that are documented at http://wiki.eeeuser.com/

performance.)

Editing Sound Files with Audacity
Audacity (as shown in Figure 13-4) is a powerful, digital sound editor. It’s 
a souped-up version of the Sound Recorder found in the Play tab that can 
record sounds and edit the generated WAV file. The program can also save 
WAV files in compressed MP3 format — a space-saving must if you’re using 
your Eee PC to take and save lecture notes.

BitTorrenting with FrostWire
FrostWire is a peer-to-peer (Gnutella and BitTorrent) file-sharing program. 
The open-source application, shown in Figure 13-6, is written in Java and 
is a variation of LimeWire; a popular Gnutella client. In addition to many 
advanced P2P features, it also includes a built-in media player.
In the Tools menu, select Options. Here you can specify whether to save 
downloaded files to an SD card or to a USB thumb drive. If you do a lot of 
BitTorrenting, the Eee PC’s small internal drive can fill up pretty fast.

Stargazing with Stellarium
I’m kind of a sucker for astronomy programs. Although Planetarium/KStars 
in the Learn tab is pretty cool (I tell you all about it in Chapter 7), an even 
better sky-watching tool is called Stellarium, shown in Figure 13-7.
Stellarium is an open-source planetarium program that gives you a photo-
realistic view of the night sky. It’s just like looking at the stars (and planets) 
with binoculars or a telescope. Set coordinates for any place on earth, and 
see what the sky looks like at a certain date and time.

Figure 13-7:

Initially, Stellarium won’t run on an Eee PC and displays an error message 
about an incorrect screen size. To use the program, you need to make a few 
changes to a configuration file. Here’s how:
 
1. Using File Manager (in the desktop Work tab), go to your Home 
directory.
 
 In the View menu, make sure Show Hidden Files is checked.
 
2. Open the .stellarium directory.
 
3. Double-click config.ini.
 
4. Change settings to the following:
[video]
fullscreen = true
screen_w = 800

Here’s what you need to type at the command line:
To install Stellarium: sudo apt-get install stellarium

Some Eee PC models might have Stellarium pre-installed. If it’s already on 
your mini-laptop, there’s no need to install it again.
Balancing Your Checkbook 
with GnuCash
If you want to track finances on your Eee PC, check out an open-source program 
called GnuCash — think of it as a free alternative to Quicken or QuickBooks. 
GnuCash (a sample screen is shown in Figure 13-8) allows you to track bank 
accounts, stocks, income, and expenses. You can use it for personal or business 
finances.
To find out more about GnuCash, visit www.gnucash.org.

Word Processing with AbiWord
If you don’t like the OpenOffice word processor, try a popular free alternative
called AbiWord (shown in Figure 13-9). AbiWord is a fast and easy-to-use 
word processor with all the features you need to write papers and reports.
If you want to exchange documents with Microsoft Word, your best bet is to 
use Rich Text Format (RTF). Keep in mind that OpenOffice supports many 
more import file formats than AbiWord.
After installation, the only configuration you may need to perform to get 
AbiWord working with your Eee PC involves the spell checker.
If Check spelling as you type is enabled in the Preferences dialog box (in the 
Edit menu, select Preferences), the Check Spelling item in the Tools menu is 
dimmed. Turn off automatic checking and try spell checking the document.

If spell checking still isn’t working, download a spell checker package and 
create a link to it. This is a simple task. Quit AbiWord, and in the console, 
enter these commands: 
sudo apt-get install ispell
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/ispell /usr/share/enchant/ispell
The next time you run AbiWord, spell checking should work.
To learn more about AbiWord, go to www.abisource.com/.
Here’s what you need to type at the command line:
To install AbiWord: sudo apt-get install abiword
To run AbiWord: abiword
To uninstall AbiWord: sudo apt-get remove abiword
Running Windows Programs with Wine
Wine is a program that enables you to run Windows programs inside of Linux — 
Wine stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator, in case you’re curious. Wine started 
development back in 1993, and the 1.0 version was finally released in the 
summer of 2008. Its goal is to allow many different types of Windows programs 
to function under Linux — for example, a Windows utility running on a Linux 
Eee PC is shown in Figure 13-10.
 
Figure 13-10:
 Wine 
running a 
Windows 
utility on 
a Linux 
Eee PC.
 

221
 Chapter 13: Popular Linux Programs
Keep in mind that not all Windows programs work with Wine, and there are 
some limitations in using it. I recommend that, if you regularly run Windows 
applications, you’re probably better off getting a Windows XP Eee PC — 
despite what Linux fanboys say.
To learn more about Wine, visit the official project site at www.winehq.org. 
There’s also an extensive tutorial on installing and running Wine on the Eee 
PC at http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:wine.
To install Wine, type this at the command line: sudo apt-get install wine.
If you want to use Synaptic to install Wine on your Eee PC, check out Laptop 
Magazine’s easy-to-follow how-to at www.laptopmag.com/advice/
how-to/eee-pc-wine.aspx.
To run a Windows program after you’ve installed Wine, follow these steps:
 
1. In File Manager, choose the Windows program.
 
2. Right-click and select Open With.
 
3. In the /usr/bin directory, choose Wine
 
 If the program is compatible with Wine and the emulator is configured 
correctly, the program opens up in a window and runs just like a Linux 
application.
To uninstall Wine, type this at the command line: sudo apt-get remove wine.
Got game?
I couldn’t end this chapter without mentioning 
games. Although Linux Eee PCs come with a 
few fun games, if you’re a serious gamer, you 
might find them, well, rather lame. Granted, the 
small screen and limited processor and graph-
ics card don’t make the Eee PC the most killer 
game machine, but you can play a surprising 
number of “real” games on the mini-laptop. 
Here are a few resources to consult to get 
game:
 ✓ Linux Gaming forum — The EeeUser.
com forums host a forum devoted to Linux 
games: http://forum.eeeuser.
com/viewforum.php?id=29.
 ✓ List of Eee PC compatible games —

 ✓ Eee PC Crysis and Quake 4 — A little hard 
to believe you say? Here’s a YouTube 
video with proof (www.youtube.com/
watch?v=Y4cUl9WFv7g). This magic 
is made possible by streaming the game 
from a Windows PC to the Eee PC. Check

Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 

Chapter 14
Popular Free Windows Programs
In This Chapter
▶ Essential Internet applications
▶ Programs for work and play
▶ Keeping your Eee PC secure
▶ Software download sources
L
et’s face it. Linux Eee PCs come with a lot more preinstalled software than 
their Windows cousins. That’s a benefit of open-source software; ASUS 
can load Linux mini-laptops up with all sorts of free and useful programs.
If you’re running Windows XP, don’t feel slighted. You still have several options 
for loading up your Eee PC with more software. You can do the following:
 
✓ Buy commercial software (however, hold off for a minute and read this 
chapter before you do that).
 
✓ Install commercial software you already own (following the licensing 
agreements of course).
 
✓ Download some great free programs.
That last option is what this chapter is all about. I list and describe what I feel 
are the best free Windows programs in a variety of categories. Many of these 
programs are especially well-suited to the Eee PC because they are fairly 
lightweight — that means they don’t consume a lot of system resources like 
memory, CPU cycles, and drive space; all of which are at a premium in the 
mini-laptop.
In addition to the top 20 or so applications, I also point you to a number of 
Web sites that contain even more free Windows software. By the end of this 
chapter, you’ll investigate some new and useful programs for your Eee PC — 
and your other Windows desktops or laptops for that matter. So read on.

224
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
 
Some software installs a program only to a hard (or solid state) drive. If you 
want to install a program to an SD card to save drive space, an installation pro-
gram may prevent you from browsing to and choosing the card as the destina-
tion. To get around this, determine the card reader’s drive letter (for example, 
D:), and then type in the path where you want the program installed — such 
as, D:/CoolProgram.
Essential Internet Programs
The Eee PC shines as a highly portable and easy-to-use appliance for access-
ing the Internet. You want to have the mini-laptop loaded with everything you 
need to browse, e-mail, download, and chat. Although Windows XP models 
do come bundled with several Net programs, I recommend a few alternatives 
that work quite well on the Eee PC.
Firefox (browser)
Yes, I know. Windows XP already comes with the Internet Explorer Web 
browser. So why should you take up precious drive space installing another 
browser? I have three words for you, “Speed, security, and features.” The 
Firefox browser is faster (and consumes less system memory), is more secure, 
and has a whole lot of innovative features that makes browsing easier.
You owe it to yourself to give Firefox a spin — especially the 3.0 and later ver-
sions. Try it, you’ll like it. And if you don’t, it’s easy to uninstall. For more infor-
mation and to download the browser, go to www.mozilla.com/firefox/.
 
I briefly discuss Firefox running under Linux in Chapter 4, so if you’ve never 
used the browser, you might want to give the section a quick read. The Linux 
version has the same basic features and interface as the Windows release. 
I also discuss some add-on programs that make it easier to use Firefox on 
the Eee PC’s small screen; regardless of whether you’re running Linux or 
Windows.
Opera (browser)
Another free Internet Explorer alternative to consider is the Opera browser. 
Actually Opera is more than a browser because it can send and receive 
e-mail, manage RSS and newsfeeds, download files with BitTorrent, and a 
whole lot more. Opera is fast, and its screen configuration and keyboard com-
mands lend themselves quite well to the Eee PC.
Check this multiplatform browser out at www.opera.com.

225
 Chapter 14: Popular Free Windows Programs
Thunderbird (e-mail)
For your e-mail needs, instead of Windows Mail or Outlook, consider 
Thunderbird; a popular open-source e-mail client. To learn more about 
Thunderbird, refer to Chapter 4 where I cover the Linux version of the e-mail 
program — which has the same basic features and interface as the one for 
Windows. Or, visit the project Web site at www.mozilla.com/thunderbird.
µTorrent (BitTorrent)
If you use BitTorrent, you may already have a favorite Windows client. Just 
be aware, however, some BitTorrent clients use a lot of system resources 
(Azureus and BitComet both come to mind) and really aren’t well-designed 
for use on small-screen laptops.
For torrenting on a Windows Eee PC, I recommend using µTorrent, which is 
both small and stingy with system resources.
 
µTorrent is also known as Micro Torrent (the little squiggly character at the 
front is the Greek letter Mu, which is used in science to represent micro; one-
millionth) or You Torrent (µ looks like you, and because µ is hard to find on the 
keyboard, many people use the letter u as in uTorrent).
To learn more about µTorrent and download the program, visit www.
utorrent.com.
 
Your Eee PC doesn’t have hundreds of gigabytes of free drive space available 
like your primary PC. So remember to go easy with the torrent downloading.
Pidgin (instant messaging)
For instant messaging (IM), Windows comes with Live Messenger (formerly 
called MSN Messenger). If you use MSN for your chatting, this IM client is 
sufficient (although I personally like an open-source program called aMSN, 
which has more features — download it from www.amsn-project.net). If 
you’re wondering what aMSN stands for, it’s Alvaro’s Messenger (MSN) — 
the name of original developer Alvaro Iradier.
If you’re using AIM, Yahoo, or another IM network, you can obviously use the 
network’s proprietary software, or better yet, give a multinetwork IM client 
called Pidgin a try (www.pidgin.im). I describe the Linux release of Pidgin 
in Chapter 4 — it has the same basic features and interface as the Windows 
version.

226
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
 
For Internet phone calls, Skype comes bundled with Windows XP Eee PCs. If 
you installed Windows on a Linux mini-laptop and need Skype, you can down-
load it at www.skype.com.
Work and Entertainment Applications
If you purchased an Eee PC with Windows, you’ll find it has Microsoft Works 
(a very basic office suite that’s not fully compatible with Microsoft Office), 
StarSuite (a proprietary office product that shares OpenOffice programs), 
and Adobe Reader. That’s it for the work-related programs. For entertain-
ment, you’ve got the old, standard-issue Windows games and accessories and 
Windows Media Player.
Portable apps
Back in the old days of personal computing, 
most programs were truly standalone. You could 
copy a program on to a floppy disk, insert it in 
any compatible PC, and then run the program. In 
those long ago days, programs had to be small 
and efficient because memory and drive space 
was limited. Then came lots of memory, big hard 
drives, and complex operating systems which 
led to bigger programs and more complicated 
installations (because of support libraries and 
registries). Just like the floppy disk, the days of 
simply being able to move a program from one 
computer to another went by the wayside.
But lately, thanks to cheap USB thumb drives, 
portable applications are making a comeback. 
The general idea is to put a Windows program 
on a thumb drive, plug the drive into any PC, and 
then run the program without worrying about 
registry entries, support files, and other issues 
that typically keep a program chained to the 
C: drive.
In order to do this, an application needs to be 
rewritten or be initially developed with por-
tability in mind. The good news is that many 
free and open-source Windows programs are 
jumping on the portability bandwagon, includ-
ing a fair number of the ones I mention in this 
chapter (such as Firefox, Thunderbird, Pidgin, 
and OpenOffice).
This is a pretty slick solution for a space-con-
strained Windows Eee PC because you can 
install your favorite programs on a USB thumb 
drive or SD card, thus freeing up internal drive 
space. You can then move the drive or card 
between computers and always have your 
favorite programs handy.
For free Windows portable apps, check 
out http://portableapps.com, 
www.pendriveapps.com, and www.
portablefreeware.com. Here you find 
complete collections of take-anywhere, essential 
programs.

227
 Chapter 14: Popular Free Windows Programs
Now just because these programs are preinstalled, that doesn’t necessarily 
mean you have to use them — especially when there are alternatives avail-
able, such as those I discuss in the following sections.
OpenOffice (office suite)
My first piece of advice is, unless you have very limited and simple comput-
ing needs, forget about Microsoft Works. It’s not a serious office suite.
That leaves you with the preinstalled StarSuite, which is based on OpenOffice 
(I tell you all about that open-source project in Chapter 5). I’d get rid of that 
program, too, and opt for the latest release of OpenOffice. Although StarSuite 
and OpenOffice share the same programs, support is better with OpenOffice, 
thanks to an extensive user community. You also get more frequent updates. 
You can download OpenOffice and get more information at www.open
office.org.
 
As you may have guessed, I’m a big fan of open-source software. However, I 
still give a slight node to older versions of Microsoft Office over OpenOffice 
for speed and usability on an Eee PC. OpenOffice is a great free alternative to 
Microsoft Office, but if you have an older version of Office lying around (spe-
cifically the 1997, 2000, or the XP version — later releases are kind of resource 
hogs, to put it bluntly), you’ll probably prefer it over OpenOffice.
FoxIt (PDF reader)
How do I put this politely? Adobe Reader has gotten, er, rather bloated in its 
old age. It consumes a lot of system resources and has a number of features 
the average user never touches. So for reading PDF files, I recommend FoxIt, 
a free, slick little PDF reader that’s less filling and tastes great. You can down-
load it at www.foxitsoftware.com.
Paint.Net (graphics)
Although the Paint accessory that comes with Windows XP is perfectly fine 
for doing basic graphics work, if you want a program that’s a little more 
Photoshop-like in terms of features, check out Paint.net (www.getpaint.
net). Paint.net is free, and (for all its whistles, bells, and tools) it runs pretty 
well on an Eee PC.

228
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
VLC (video player)
Instead of using the default Windows Media Player, give VLC a try. VLC is 
a popular, free, cross-platform media player that supports all the common 
video formats, streaming video and playing DVD movies (plus, it’s not as 
resource intensive as Windows Media Player). You can download VLC and 
learn more about it at www.videolan.org/vlc.
 
Another alternative media player that’s not as widely known, but still is well 
suited to the Eee PC because of its low resource usage, is the GOM Media 
Player. Check it out at www.gomlab.com/eng/.
AsTray Plus
AsTray Plus is a free Windows utility that 
increases an Eee PC’s screen resolution. 
Although it’s impossible for any software pack-
age to add more pixels to a display monitor, it 
is possible for a clever programmer to do some 
tricks with fonts, color depth, and other settings 
to make it appear that you’ve got a larger screen 
(although if you set the resolution to 1024 x 768, I 
challenge you to make out any text that appears 
on a 7-inch screen).
For more on installing AsTray Plus, visit the 
EeeUser.com Wiki article at http://wiki.
eeeuser.com/astrayplus.
There’s also a forum thread devoted to discuss-
ing the program, including the latest on new 
releases, at http://forum.eeeuser.
com/viewtopic.php?id=18260&p=1.
Freeware XP games
Linux Eee PCs come with a pretty decent col-
lection of games. The games that are bundled 
with Windows XP, are, well, just a little bit stale. 
Even Solitaire and Mine Sweeper get old after 
awhile. Although you can plunk down some 
hard-earned cash for commercial game soft-
ware, before you do, just be aware there are 
thousands of free Windows games out there.
One of the best places to find Windows games is 
Andrew K’s XP Games Web page at http://
home.comcast.net/~SupportCD/
XPGames.html. This is a comprehensive 
list of many of the better freeware Windows 
games — conveniently organized by type, with 
a brief description and download link.
Another place to check out is Gameeer (www.
bourdeaux.net/eeepc/), a Web page 
that focuses on playing Windows games exclu-
sively on the Eee PC.
If you want to get your game on, both of these 
sites are well worth the visit.

229
 Chapter 14: Popular Free Windows Programs
foobar2000 (music player)
Although Windows Media Player can play MP3 and other audio files, for the 
Eee PC, I prefer a free audio player called foobar2000 (foobar is an inside 
joke among programmers because foo and foobar are often used as tem-
porary variable names in programs). Foobar2000 has all the options you’d 
expect to find in an audio player, plus it is resource frugal, has a great user 
interface, and an extensive feature set. To find out more, head to http://
foobar2000.org.
Safety and Security Utilities
One of the advantages to running Linux is that you don’t worry about the 
large amount of malicious software that continuously plagues Windows 
users. If you run Windows and use the Internet (or come in contact with files 
from other people), it’s essential that you have a collection of good security 
programs to keep you and your computer safe.
Although you can go the standard security suite route with Norton or 
MacAfee, keep in mind these commercial products often consume a tremen-
dous amount of system resources (which are at a premium on the Eee PC). 
They also tie you to yearly subscription fees.
Instead I suggest using a combination of lightweight, free security programs 
that have a proven track record. In this section, I give you my picks for Eee-
PC–suitable anti-virus, firewall, and spyware software.
 
Many security software companies offer both free and commercial versions 
of their products. The commercial software tends to have more features, but 
for the average user, the basic features in a free version usually provide an 
adequate level of protection.
Virus defenders
Because Windows XP doesn’t come preinstalled with software to protect you 
from viruses, one of the first things I’d suggest doing after you get your Eee 
PC is to install some anti-virus software. Two free Windows programs fit the 
bill, providing you with real-time virus protection (the software runs in the 
background and is always on the lookout for viruses).

230
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
Avast!
Avast! is a very popular anti-virus program that hails from the Czech 
Republic. It was first made available in 1988 and, as of the spring of 2008, it 
has over 50 million registered users worldwide. The software has a number 
of different features that protect you from all sorts of malicious threats. 
Download the free version and get more information at www.avast.com.
AVG
AVG is another widely used anti-virus application from the former 
Czechoslovakia (do the Czechs know viruses or what?). Avast! has a few 
more features and a cleaner interface in my opinion, but I always recommend 
downloading and evaluating both these programs to see which works best 
for you. AVG’s Web site is http://free.grisoft.com/.
 
Your Eee PC’s start-up time increases when you use anti-virus software that 
provides real-time protection — more system resources are also used because 
the program is always running. An alternative is to use the open-source 
ClamAV utility (www.clamav.net). ClamAV only searches for viruses and 
Trojans when you run the program (that means no real-time protection). If 
you have a low risk of picking up a virus, use this program to scan your drive 
every week or so to check for infections.
Firewall shields
When you’re computing at home, I highly recommend you have a router or a 
switch between your computer and the broadband connection. Routers and 
switches provide a hardware firewall that keeps the bad guys out and makes 
your PCs fairly invisible to the rest of the world.
In addition you should also be running some type of software firewall. If your 
computer becomes infected and covertly tries to send data to someone, the 
firewall lets you know and blocks any outgoing traffic. A software firewall is 
also essential if you’re on the road, accessing the Internet through a wired or 
wireless connection.
Although you can use Microsoft’s firewall that comes with Windows XP, it 
doesn’t support blocking outbound connections. Because of this, I recom-
mend two free firewalls (both of which have received high marks in indepen-
dent evaluations).
Comodo
Comodo’s free personal firewall has scored number one in several tests 
designed to measure firewall effectiveness (beating out a number of commer-
cial products I might add). Strong security, relative ease of use, and frequent 
updates make this Windows firewall my personal pick. For more information, 
go to www.personalfirewall.comodo.com.

231
 Chapter 14: Popular Free Windows Programs
Online Armor
This is another highly regarded firewall with a simpler user interface than 
Comodo. To read about its features or download it, visit www.tallemu.com.
Spyware protectors
Spyware is a broad term that relates to any ill-intentioned program or file that 
is installed on your PC without your knowing about it. Spyware is designed to 
take control or monitor your computer — without your permission.
 
Adware is often lumped together with spyware and refers to surreptitiously 
installed programs that display unwanted advertisements. Some people also 
consider cookies that are used for tracking Web site visits a form of spyware.
Spyware can be covertly installed on your computer when you run a pro-
gram or visit a Web site. It is so pervasive these days (especially targeted at 
Windows PCs), a number of both free and commercial utilities are available 
for detecting and removing unwanted pests.
Ad-Aware Free
Ad-Aware Free started out as a utility for alerting you to advertising Web 
sites that were secretly tracking your visits. Since then, the program has 
evolved into a complete spyware detection and removal tool — it identifies 
dialers, Trojan horses, keyloggers, browser hijackers, and other privacy-
violating malware. For more information and to download the program, visit 
www.lavasoft.com.
Spybot SD
Spybot SD (for Search and Destroy) is the granddaddy of spyware detection 
and removal programs. Although it’s been around forever, it’s still a valu-
able tool to have in your protection arsenal. You can learn about it at www.
safer-networking.org.
CCleaner
CCleaner (the first C stands for Crap), really isn’t a dedicated spyware detec-
tor, per se. Instead it cleans up temporary files, browser histories, cookies, 
and unused registry entries. Although spyware can hide data in some of 
these places, CCleaner is even more indispensable on a Windows Eee PC for 
getting rid of unneeded files that take up valuable drive space. To download 
the utility, go to www.ccleaner.com.
 
Call me paranoid, but I have all three of these programs installed on my 
Windows PCs. In the past there have been times when I’ve found one utility 
will detect and deal with something malicious that the others missed.

232
Part III: Adding Software to the Eee PC 
Encryption
The small form factor of the Eee PC makes it easy to carry around. It also 
makes it easy to lose or steal. If you store sensitive information on your mini-
laptop, I highly recommend you use some type of encryption to secure the 
data. (Encryption software scrambles files, requiring a password to restore 
them.)
By far the best encryption application for keeping your files safe is called 
TrueCrypt. The program is an on-the-fly encryption utility — any files you 
copy, move, or write to a protected volume are automatically encrypted. 
TrueCrypt uses several strong encryption algorithms that even the NSA 
would have difficulty cracking.
To get the lowdown on the program (you don’t need a top secret clearance), 
visit www.truecrypt.org.
More free Windows software
This chapter contains just a sampling of great, 
free Windows programs for your Eee PC. Many, 
many more free applications of all types are 
available.

Part IV
Hardware and 
Accessories for 
the Eee PC

In this part . . .
T
he Eee PC contains a surprising number of features 
for such a small and affordable laptop. But you might 
want to consider a variety of accessories and hardware 
add-ons to enhance your Eee PC’s functionality and 
usability. That’s what this part of the book is about.
You learn about expanding storage and memory, how to 
connect all sorts of different peripherals (including moni-
tors, keyboards, modems, Bluetooth, and more), and what 
you need to keep your mini-laptop powered up on the 
road (spare batteries, car chargers, and even solar power 
if you end up far off the beaten track). I also cover options 
for toting your Eee PC around town and include some tips 
on turning your mini-laptop into a fashion statement.

Chapter 15
Expanding Storage and Memory
In This Chapter
▶ Expanding storage with Secure Digital cards
▶ Using USB thumb drives
▶ USB hard drive options
▶ DVD drives and the Eee PC
▶ Upgrading memory
You have to make compromises when designing a small, light, and 
energy-efficient computer. One of those compromises in mini-laptops 
like the Eee PC is the amount of internal storage. Presently, you can’t shoe-
horn a hard drive with the kind of gigabytes you find in a larger laptop into a 
small platform — the physical dimensions of the drive are too big, and they 
consume too much power. That will change in the future as technologies 
such as Solid State Drives offer more capacity at affordable prices, but in the 
meantime you have to make do with a limited amount of storage.
The good news is that, if the Eee PC’s internal drive is just too miniscule for 
your needs, you have a number of ways to get around the gigabyte crunch. 
ASUS didn’t compromise on including a number of ways to inexpensively 
expand storage.
That’s what this chapter is about. In it, I explore SD cards, USB thumb drives, 
and other types of external USB drives you can use to save your files. The nice 
thing about all these storage options is they allow you to easily transfer data 
back and forth between your Eee PC and traditional desktop and laptop PCs.
In addition to telling you about ways to expand storage, I also cover expand-
ing your Eee PC’s internal memory with up to 2GB of RAM (that’s a bunch of 
memory in such a small computer).
That’s enough of an introduction; let’s get the show on the road.

236
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
Secure Digital Card Tricks
Because of the small amount of drive space available on Eee PC models, 
many users find the mini-laptop’s MMC/SD card reader essential for storing 
programs and data. At under $25 for a 4GB, with prices always seeming to be 
going down, SD cards (one is shown in Figure 15-1 later in this chapter) are a 
cheap way to expand storage. This section explains what you need to know 
about using them.
 
When you’re done using a SD card, be sure to use the Safely Remove (Linux) 
or Safely Remove Hardware (Windows) taskbar commands before ejecting 
the card.
Supported cards
You can use several types of memory cards with your Eee PC. They include
 
✓ SD — Secure Digital. Flash memory cards that range from 8MB to 4GB.
 
✓ SDHC — Secure Digital High Capacity. This is an extension of the SD 
standard that debuted in 2006. It allows for memory cards with capaci-
ties higher than 4GB. The size and shape of SDHC cards are identical 
to those of SD cards; however older card readers can’t read the new 
format. (High capacity cards are labeled SDHC, so you can tell the two 
cards apart.)
 
 Based on the SDHC specification, these cards can theoretically have up 
to 2,048GB of storage. Wow! However, at present, card manufacturers 
have set a maximum limit of 32GB. Don’t be surprised if that goes up in 
the future.
 
✓ MMC — SD and SDHC cards are derived from an older standard known 
as MultiMedia Cards. MMCs are slower and have less storage capacity. 
SD and SDHC cards have surpassed MMCs in popularity.
Check your Eee PC user manual for an official list of supported SD cards 
(by manufacturer and model) — just keep in mind this list isn’t complete. 
These are only the cards ASUS had tested when the manual was written. The 
EeeUser.com Wiki also maintains a user-submitted list of SD cards that work 
with Eee PCs at http://wiki.eeeuser.com/hardware:eee_un_
supported_devices.
 
If you can’t save files to an SD card, check that the write protection tab hasn’t 
been switched on accidentally. If you still can’t write data, check out Chapter 
22 where I present additional troubleshooting tips.

Formatting SD cards
You might think with an SD card, you can easily move it from your Linux 
Eee PC, to your digital camera, to a Windows or Mac PC. After all, it fits in all 
three devices. Just keep in mind these two gotchas:
 
✓ SDHC compatibility — The Eee PC can read and write SDHC cards, but 
your camera or the card reader on your Windows PC may not.
 
✓ Formatting — MMC, SD, and SDHC cards can be formatted several differ-
ent ways. Depending on how you format a card, it might not be readable 
by another device.
Eee PC file system formatting options include
 
✓ Ext2 — A Linux file system (as in second extended file system)
 
✓ Ext3 — An enhanced version of ext2
The heat is on?
If you’re having problems with corrupted files 
on an SD card or one that refuses to format cor-
rectly, the cause may be heat. Some users on 
the EeeUser.com forums (http://forum.
eeeuser.com) speculate that after the Eee 
PC has been running awhile, the card reader 
controller chip starts to overheat and cause 
troubles; especially when writing large files. 
Whereas various users have reported solving 
SD card problems by temporarily placing their 
Eee PC in a refrigerator or next to a fan or air 
conditioner, others have tried these cooling 
solutions and still had problems.
This seems to be an intermittent issue that 
doesn’t affect all Eee PCs. If you’re having SD 
card issues similar to the ones I just mentioned, 
before you put your Eee PC on ice, here are 
some things to try:
 ✓ Make sure the card isn’t defective. It’s not 
uncommon to get a bad SD card. Try using 
it on another computer. If it doesn’t work 
on any computers, then you’ve got a bad 
card.
 ✓ Make sure the card reader on the Eee PC 
isn’t defective. Again, try using the card 
with another PC. If it works on another com-
puter, you’ve got a bad card reader.
 ✓ Reformat the card (see the section 
“Formatting SD cards” in this chapter).
 ✓ Placing an Eee PC on a soft surface can 
block the cooling vents, so keep it on a hard 
surface.
 ✓ For Windows Eee PCs, try running eeectl 
(www.cpp.in/dev/eeectl/) and 
setting CPU voltage to medium. The lower 
voltage decreases CPU temperature, which 
lowers the overall heat.
 ✓ If you need to transfer large files, do so 
before the mini-laptop starts to warm up.

238
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
 
If you have a Linux computer and format a SC card as ext2 or ext3, Macs, 
Windows PCs or digital cameras are not able to read the card unless special 
drivers are installed.
 
✓ FAT16 — FAT stands for File Allocation Table — in this case, 16-bit. This 
format goes dates back to the mid-1970s and is the primary file system 
for DOS and Windows. Maximum file size is 2GB.
 
✓ FAT32 — An enhanced, 32-bit version of FAT that debuted in 1996 offer-
ing larger volume and maximum file sizes.
 
Most SD and SDHC cards come formatted as FAT16 or FAT32. You shouldn’t 
need to format them before using.
If you need to reformat an SD card (if it somehow gets corrupted or is in a dif-
ferent format), here’s how to do it with your Eee PC. First, insert the card and 
then follow these steps:
Formatting with Windows
To format an SD card with a Windows Eee PC
 
1. Right-click the Start button and select Explore.
 
2. In Windows Explorer, select the drive letter associated with the card 
you want to format.
 
3. Right-click and select Format from the pop-up menu.
 
4. Select the format type and give the card a name.
 
 One of the options is NTFS. For compatibility with the Eee PC and other 
devices, don’t use this option. Stick with one of the versions of FAT 
instead.
 
5. Click Start.
 
If you want to use the SD Card Association’s (the SD standards group) official 
formatting utility, you can download a Windows version at this site: www.
sdcard.org/about/downloads/.
Formatting with Linux
On a Linux Eee PC, use the command line to format an SD card.
For example, the following console commands format an SD card as FAT32:
sudo -i
umount /dev/sdb1
mkdosfs -F 32 -n volume_name /dev/sdb1

239
 Chapter 15: Expanding Storage and Memory
Replace volume_name with whatever you want to call the card (up to 11 
characters). If there’s a space in the name, enclose it in quotes.
Here’s a link to a tutorial for formatting a card to other formats: http://
wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:format_sd.
 
If you need to format an SD or SDHC card, instead of using your Linux Eee 
PC, use a Windows PC or Mac. It’s easier and as long as you format the card 
as FAT16 or FAT32, you can use it with Linux, Mac, and Windows PCs, digital 
cameras, and other electronic devices.
Disabling the Device Detection dialog box
Whenever you insert an SD card or USB device into the Linux Eee PC, a dialog 
box appears and politely asks you if you’d like to run a program to open files 
(such as music or videos) or use File Manager to view the contents of the 
device. This is nice and user-friendly, but can get a little annoying if you leave 
an SD card in the reader and the dialog box always shows up when you turn 
the mini-laptop on. If you have a 2G, 4G, or 8G Linux Eee PC, here’s how to 
disable the feature:
 
1. Start a command-line console session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. At the command line, enter sudo chmod a-x /usr/bin/xandros_device_
detection_dialog.
chmod a-x is a file permission command that changes a program (the 
Device Detection dialog box, in this case) setting so it is no longer execut-
able. To restore the program, in the console, enter:
sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/xandros_device_detection_dialog
This simple command disables the dialog box whenever a SD card or USB 
device is inserted. But if you just want to disable the dialog box when the Eee 
PC starts up (if there’s an SD card already in place), it’s a little more compli-
cated. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Start a command-line console session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. Enter: sudo mv /usr/bin/xandros_device_detection_dialog /usr/bin/
xandros_device_detection_dialog.bak
 
 This renames the file that contains the Device Detection dialog code.
 
3. Enter sudo kwrite /usr/bin/xandros_device_detection_dialog.
 
 Now create a new file, with the same name as the original.

240
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
 
4. Add the following to the new file:
#!/bin/sh
awk ë$1 < 40 { exit 1 }í /proc/uptime && xandros_device_
detection_dialog.bak ì$@î &.
 
 You can also go to this link, where you can copy the preceding text and 
paste it directly into the new file: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:
tempdisabledevicedetection.
 
5. Save the file.
 
6. At the console, enter the following:
sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/xandros_device_detection_dialog
 
 This sets the permission so the new file is executable.
The modified code checks if the Eee PC has just started up when an SD card 
is present. If it has, it doesn’t display the Device Detection dialog box. If 
the Eee PC has been running for awhile and a card is inserted, the Device 
Detection dialog box is displayed.
In a Flash: USB Thumb Drives
Back in the day, floppy disks were the technology of choice for saving files 
and moving data between computers. In 2000, IBM and Trek Technology 
introduced a slick alternative to the floppy disk that would change the course 
of personal computing. Dubbed the thumb drive the product was a flash 
memory card with a USB connector, enclosed in a small plastic case. Plugged 
into a PC’s USB port, the drive offered a whopping 8MB of storage (around 
five times more than a 3.5-inch floppy disk).
The rest is history, and USB thumb drives (also known as flash drives, pen 
drives, jump drives, key drives, and UFDs — USB Flash Drives) have become 
a ubiquitous part of everyday computing (several drives are shown in Figure 
15-1). Now small storage devices are available in sizes up to 32GB (it’s dif-
ficult to find new drives under 1GB these days). Capacities seem to always be 
rising with prices falling. As I write this, if you shop around you can get a 4GB 
thumb drive for around $30.
The Eee PC has three USB 2.0 ports (which are compatible with older and 
slower 1.1 USB thumb drives, as well as the more modern, faster 2.0 drives). 
Just plug a thumb drive into either Linux or Windows versions of the mini-
laptop and use File Manager or Windows Explorer respectively to access 
your files.

241

When you’re done using a thumb drive, be sure to use the Safely Remove 
(Linux) or Safely Remove Hardware (Windows) taskbar commands before 
removing the drive.
Thumb drive life cycles
Nothing lasts forever, and that statement holds 
true for thumb drives. Several criteria determine 
the life span of a thumb drive.
The first is the type of flash memory used. The 
most common is called MLC (multilevel cell). 
There’s also SLC (single-level cell), which is 
twice as fast (as well as twice as expensive). 
SLC also boasts a longer life cycle of 100,000 
write/erase cycles compared to MLC’s 10,000 
write cycles. (Unfortunately, most manufac-
turers don’t label their products, so you won’t 
know if a more expensive thumb drive is using 
SLC or not.)
Right around the maximum number of write 
cycles, a thumb drive slowly starts to fail — 
parts of its memory can no longer be used. 
Many thumb drives have a five-year warranty, 
and under normal use should last beyond that.
The other factor that limits a thumb drive’s life is 
the USB connector. Manufacturers use a figure 
known as mating durability (I’m not kidding) to 
predict the maximum number of connections 
before failure. That number is about 1,500.
I wouldn’t get too concerned about thumb 
drive cycles. I’m convinced the biggest risks 
for thumb drives to be cut down in the prime 
of their lives comes from the owner’s losing 
the darn things or accidentally sending them 
through the wash.

242
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
I’ve yet to find a thumb drive that doesn’t work with the Eee PC, but check 
your Eee PC user manual for the official list of supported USB drives (by 
manufacturer and model) — just keep in mind, the list is far from complete. 
The EeeUser.com Wiki also maintains a list of thumb drives users have had 
success with at http://wiki.eeeuser.com/hardware:eee_un_
supported_devices.
 
If your MP3 player can serve as a USB mass storage device (often referred to 
as MSC or UMS), you can use it with your Eee PC to transfer and save files. 
Just connect the player to the mini-laptop with a USB cable, and the player’s 
memory or drive appears as a volume in File Manager (Linux) or Windows 
Explorer (Windows XP).
 
If you’re a Windows user who frequently defragments your hard drive to 
keep it running well, you may have thought about defragmenting your USB 
thumb drive. Don’t bother. Defragmentation works by optimizing access to 
data on a drive with spinning platters and moving heads. Flash memory is 
random-access, and you don’t get any performance gains with defragmenting. 
Additionally, because defragmentation moves data around for optimization, 
the write/erases decrease the flash memory’s life (see the “Thumb drive life 
cycles” sidebar).
USB “Not That Hard” Drives
If an SD card or thumb drive doesn’t meet your storage needs, a simple solu-
tion is to use a portable USB hard drive. These are traditional external hard 
drives, with smaller enclosures, designed to be easily moved around (an 
example is shown in Figure 15-2). Just plug a drive into your mini-laptop and, 
voilà, you’ve got hundreds of gigabytes at your disposal. Plus, the drive is 
easy to move between different computers.
USB hard drives come in a variety of sizes, but I like the small ones you can 
easily slip inside a pocket. These portable devices use small hard drives that 
limit the amount of available space (generally in the 120 to 320GB size range). 
If you don’t plan on taking your hard drive on the road much, you can always 
opt for a physically larger drive with more storage space (just be aware that 
a larger drive may require two USB ports as I discuss in the “USB power con-
siderations” sidebar).
 
When you’re done using a USB hard drive, be sure to use the Safely Remove 
(Linux) or Safely Remove Hardware (Windows) taskbar commands before 
removing the drive.

USB power considerations
USB ports not only transfer data back and forth, 
but can also provide power to a connected 
device. (That’s where an external drive is get-
ting its juice from, unless it uses its own power 
supply.)
Ideally, you plug a USB hard drive or DVD into 
your Eee PC and everything works, with the files 
and folders all displayed in File Manager (Linux) 
or Windows Explorer. However, to function cor-
rectly, some drives need more power than a 
single USB port can provide.
This is addressed with a special USB Y-cable. 
You plug the two ends of the cable into two Eee 
PC USB ports and the single end into the hard 
drive. This supplies enough power to run the 
drive from the two ports.
Drives that require power from a single USB 
port are more energy efficient, which means 
longer battery life when you’re not plugged into 
a wall socket. They also don’t tie up a second 
USB port. If you have a choice, always go with 
a drive that only needs a single cable.

244
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
Prices for smaller portable drives range from around $100 to $200. Popular 
USB drive manufacturers include
 
✓ Iomega — www.iomega.com
 
✓ Maxtor — www.maxtor.com
 
✓ Seagate — www.seagate.com
 
✓ SimpleTech — www.simpletech.com
 
✓ Western Digital — www.westerndigital.com
 
If you have an IDE or SATA internal hard drive from an old PC lying around 
collecting dust, consider turning it into a cheap storage device for your Eee 
PC. Just pick up a USB IDE adaptor. Plug one end into the old hard drive (or 
an old internal CD or DVD drive for that matter), hook up the included power 
supply if needed, and then plug the USB connector into the Eee PC. The adap-
tors are reasonably priced at under $25 and are available from a number of 
online retailers. Do a Google search for usb ide adaptor.
Check your Eee PC user manual for an official list of supported USB hard 
drives (by manufacturer and model) — remember the list doesn’t give you 
everything that works. Visit the EeeUser.com Wiki for a user-submitted 
record of compatible USB hard drives: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/

DVD Drives for Dummies
Unlike traditional laptops, and Eee PC doesn’t come with a built-in DVD drive — 
considering the size, there’s no place to put it. Realistically, because of Eee PC’s 
role as an ultra-portable laptop, you can easily get by without a DVD drive for it.
Swapping SSDs
Some Eee PCs (notably the 900 and later 
models) come with a socketed slot that makes 
it easy to replace the Solid State Drive (SSD). 
As this book goes to press, third-party SSDs 
are starting to appear that offer more storage 
and faster data read and write speeds than the 
default ASUS drives. Do-it-yourself installation 
is simple. You open the bottom of your Eee PC, 
unplug the old drive, and swap it with the new 
one. Prices depend on the type of flash memory 
(faster SLC memory is more expensive than 
slower MLC) and the amount of memory you 
want. Since the third-party SSD market is in its 
infancy, don’t expect the cheap prices you’d 
pay for a conventional hard drive. A 16GB SLC 
drive currently runs around $200. Prices will 
fall as SSDs become more widely used, but for 
now, you are charged a premium price.

245
 Chapter 15: Expanding Storage and Memory
A couple of reasons might lead you to purchasing a DVD drive, however. For 
example, if you want to do any the following:
 
✓ Watch movies on commercial DVDs. If you want to watch rented or pur-
chased movies on your Eee PC’s DVD player, you must add some addi-
tional files to your Linux Eee PC. I tell you how in Chapter 8.
 
✓ Restore your system from the recovery DVD that came with your com-
puter. With a Linux Eee PC you can create a recovery USB thumb drive 
on a Windows PC that has a DVD drive. However, if you have a Windows 
Eee PC and you want to restore your system, you need an external DVD 
drive connected to the mini-laptop to use the recovery DVD. (I discuss 
restoring your Eee PC in Chapter 18.)
 
✓ Access files you have stored on DVDs.
To use DVDs with your Eee PC, you need a portable, USB DVD drive such 
as the one shown in Figure 15-3. (This is an LG model GSA-E50N by the way, 
which is very popular with Eee PC users and works quite well with both 
Linux and Windows models.) Portable DVD drives are priced between $100 
and $150 and are available online or from most large electronics retailers.
 
If you have an old internal DVD drive from a desktop PC or laptop, you may be 
able to connect it to your Eee PC with an IDE to USB converter. See the previ-
ous section on hard drives to find out more.

Check your Eee PC user manual for an official list of supported USB DVD 
drives (by manufacturer and model) — remember, just because a drive 
doesn’t appear on the list doesn’t mean it’s not compatible. Check out the 
EeeUser.com Wiki for DVD drives users have had success with: http://
wiki.eeeuser.com/hardware:eee_un_supported_devices.
More Memory
With most Eee PC models, you can expand the system memory up to 2GB — 
the 2G Surf is the exception because its 512K of memory is soldered into 
place. Here’s everything you need to know about purchasing and installing 
memory.
Eee PCs use DDR2-667 SODIMM memory chips — DDR2 laptop memory 
that runs at a speed of 667 MHz (also known as PC2-5300). This memory is 
commonly used in many different laptops. Depending on the brand, where 
you purchase it, and how much memory you buy (1 or 2GB), expect to pay 
between $20 and $50. (Like the stock market, memory prices seem to always 
be going up or down.)
 
A number of different memory brands are available. Check out this active and 
ongoing forum thread for a discussion of what brands have worked well (and 
not so well) for Eee PC users: http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.
php?id=26317&p=1.
Is more memory worth it?
Is boosting your Eee PC’s memory really worth 
it? It depends on what model of mini-laptop you 
have and how you use it. For most people, the 
amount of memory that comes with their Eee PC 
is more than adequate for day-to-day use. But, 
if you’re thinking about upgrading your memory, 
here are my recommendations.
If you’re running Linux on an Eee PC with 512K of 
RAM, you may see a small performance increase 
if you upgrade RAM (especially if you frequently 
run multiple programs at the same time). For 
what it’s worth, I’ve been perfectly happy with 
the performance of a 512K Linux 4G.
If you’re running Windows XP on an Eee 
PC with 512K of RAM, you get an increase in 
performance with more memory (not a differ-
ence of day-and-night, but one that is notice-
able). I’d lean toward upgrading if you’re 
comfortable installing the memory yourself.
If your Eee PC comes with a gigabyte of memory, 
2GB gives you a bit more performance (but not 
much). Unless you have a real need for another 
gigabyte (or must always have the most avail-
able memory), I’d pass on upgrading.
Memory does help, but remember you still have 
a relatively underpowered processor that’s 
holding you back from having a machine as fast 
as your primary desktop PC or laptop.

247
 Chapter 15: Expanding Storage and Memory
 
The Eee PC doesn’t have empty slots to add more memory. To expand your 
RAM, replace the existing memory with a larger amount — which means a 1GB 
or 2GB module. If you have a 512K Linux model, you can currently only expand 
to 1GB of memory (I describe a way around this in the “Beating the 1GB limit” 
sidebar). Also, don’t bother spending the extra money to get RAM faster than 
667 MHz, as the performance gains don’t justify the additional cost.
After you’ve purchased memory, installation is a quick (couple of minutes) 
and easy process that consists of these steps:
 
1. Turn off the Eee PC.
 
2. Open the panel on the bottom of the Eee PC (held in place with 
several screws).
 
3. Remove the old memory.
 
4. Put the new memory into the empty slot.
 
5. Reattach the panel.
 
6. Turn the Eee PC on and check that it works.
 
If you want to see what upgrading memory on an Eee PC is all about, check 
out this great Web tutorial with detailed instructions (including photos and a 
video) at: www.wikihow.com/Upgrade-Memory-in-an-Asus-Eee-PC.
Beating the 1GB limit
On 2G, 4G, and 8G Eee PCs running Linux, the 
Xandros system can only access up to 1GB 
of RAM (900 and later models don’t have this 
issue). That means if you buy 2GB of RAM, your 
Eee PC will only use half of it. (This doesn’t 
apply to these mini-laptops if they’re running 
Windows or other versions of Linux.)
To get around this barrier, recompile the Linux 
kernel. This is a pretty advanced move (even 
for the average techie), requiring you to make 
a few changes in the operating system source 
code, use a compiler to create new binary code, 
and then install the new kernel on your Eee PC. 
Definitely not for the faint of heart!
If you’re a little technically inclined though and 
want to max out your RAM, you can download 
and install a precompiled version of the kernel 
with the necessary changes and use instructions 
from this how-to: http://wiki.eeeuser.
com/howto:install2gigkernel.
If this whole process looks intimidating, don’t 
sweat it. Be happy with 1GB of RAM. The extra 
GB doesn’t make that much of a difference.

Essential Eee PC Accessories
In This Chapter
▶ Eee PC carrying cases
▶ Mice and keyboards
▶ Bluetooth accessories
▶ Personalizing your Eee PC
▶ Dial-up modems
▶ External monitors and projectors
▶ GPS and the Eee PC
T
he Eee PC is ready to use out of the box. But if you’re like most people, 
you probably want to pick up some accessories to go with your mini-
laptop. Some popular accessories include carrying cases, wireless mice, 
Bluetooth gadgets, and GPS receivers.
In this chapter, I give you the lowdown on these Eee PC accessories and 
more — including keyboards, dial-up modems, external monitors, and 
presentation projectors. I even tell you how to personalize the outside of 
your Eee PC and turn it into the ultimate fashion accessory.
 
The most widely used type of Eee PC accessory is some form of external 
storage device — such as an SD card, USB thumb drive, or DVD drive. I devote 
Chapter 15 to discussing these and other storage-related accessories.
Getting Carried Away
Although the Eee PC is small and light enough to carry around in your hand, I 
recommend using some type of a case when it’s time to leave the house or 
office. A carrying case offers added protection from bumps and drops, isn’t 
as likely to slip out of your hands, and can provide much-needed room for 
your wall charger, spare battery, and other accessories.

250
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
Because of the Eee PC’s diminutive size, you have many options available 
when selecting a suitable carrying case — especially compared to larger 
laptops. Sure you can always buy a laptop case fitted for the Eee PC 
(as mini-laptops become more popular, expect lots of options), but don’t 
discount more frugal alternatives. Some of the creative ways Eee PC users 
are toting around their mini-laptops include
 
✓ DVD player cases
 
✓ Hardware store tool bags
 
✓ Padded lunch sacks
 
✓ Camera bags
 
✓ Bible cases (from Christian bookstores)
 
✓ Shoulder travel bags and purses
 
✓ Mailing envelopes (with bubblewrap padding)
My favorite way to protect and carry an Eee PC is with a case designed for a 
portable DVD player. The smaller model Eee PCs match the general dimen-
sions of many travel DVD players, and there are a lot of nice, padded cases 
on the market — I personally like the Case Logic brand. These products don’t 
cost an arm and a leg; they can be had for under $20 — an example is shown 
in Figure 16-1.

 Chapter 16: Essential Eee PC Accessories
 
If you have a sewing machine in the house, and someone who knows how to 
use it, here’s a great illustrated tutorial for making your own Eee PC carrying 
case out of fabric: http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?id
=13300.
If whatever you carry your Eee PC in isn’t padded, use a protective sleeve — 
priced around $10 or less. I like neoprene sleeves (the same material used in 
wetsuits) the best because of the extra padding and water-shedding qualities. 
Custom-fit sleeves for the Eee PC are available from many online retailers 
who stock accessories for the mini-laptop.
Mice and Keyboards
If the Eee PC’s touchpad or keyboard is a little too small for your personal 
tastes, you can always take advantage of the mini-laptop’s three USB ports 
and use a different mouse or keyboard. Here’s the scoop.
 
If you use an external keyboard and mouse with your Eee PC, temporarily 
turning it into more of a desktop computer, be sure to raise the mini-laptop so 
the screen is closer to eye level. Good ergonomic practices make a difference 
if you’re going to be spending hours typing away.
Mice
In the mouse department, you have two types to choose from:
 
✓ Cable — This is the traditional mouse that comes with desktop PCs. 
If you’ve got a spare USB mouse lying around, just plug it into the 
Eee PC, and you’re in business. In addition to larger mice, a number of 
companies make smaller mice designed for laptops and travel. (ASUS 
also makes mice in a number of different colors for the Eee PC.)
 
✓ Wireless — Wireless mice ditch the cable and work with radio signals 
that are sent between the mouse and computer. These mice either use a 
proprietary transmitter/receiver that plugs into a USB port or rely on 
Bluetooth (either built-in or as an add-on).
One of the more popular wireless mice for the Eee PC (and other laptops 
for that matter), is Logitech’s VX Nano — shown in Figure 16-2. This mini-
mighty-mouse runs on two AAA batteries and communicates with the Eee PC 
through a tiny dongle that plugs into a USB port. The dongle is so small that 
it can be stowed away inside the mouse — a handy feature to prevent loss. 
VX Nanos are priced around $55.

If you have a Linux Eee PC, check out this how-to information on configuring 
all the buttons on a VX Nano: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/configure_
logitech_vx_nano.
Mice come with many different features such as three buttons, scroll wheels, 
retractable cables, and lasers for more precise tracking. For a new mouse, 
expect to pay between $25 and $100 depending on the features.
 
Wireless mice consume more power than wired mice, so if you’re trying to 
maximize battery life, go for a mouse with a tail.
Keyboards
Until some of the latest Eee PC models with larger keyboards were available, 
one of the biggest grouses about the mini-laptop was its undersized key-
board. With a little practice, most people get used to small keyboard — be 
patient, it does take some time. But if you’re just not getting the hang of the 
small keys, consider these three types of third-party USB keyboards:
 
✓ Conventional — Got an old desktop PC with a USB keyboard gathering 
dust in a closet? Just plug the keyboard into your Eee PC. Not the most 
portable solution in the world, but there are also reduced-size travel 
keyboards available for under $40.
 
✓ Folding — If a travel keyboard is still a little too bulky for you, an 
alternative is to get a folding keyboard. As the name suggests, these 
keyboards fold in half when not in use. Models range from full to travel 
size and are priced in the $40 to $60 range.

253
 Chapter 16: Essential Eee PC Accessories
 
✓ Roll-up — Your last option is to forget about a conventional, hard plas-
tic keyboard and go with a soft keyboard that rolls up. These flexible, 
water-resistant keyboards (as shown in Figure 16-3) are produced by a 
number of companies and are priced between $20 and $40. A drawback 
is that the soft silicone keys are silent (which takes some time getting 
used to) and don’t have the best tactile feel.
Do a Google search for travel keyboard, folding keyboard, or flexible keyboard 
for manufacturers and dealers.
 
If your Eee PC has Bluetooth support, wireless keyboards are also available.
Honestly, I think toting an external keyboard around detracts from the porta-
bility and purpose of the Eee PC. If the 2G, 4G, 900, and 901 keyboards are too 
small for you, my advice is to go for an Eee PC with a larger keyboard.
 
If all your USB ports are in use and you need more, invest in a hub. This is a 
USB version of an electrical extension cord with multiple outlets. You plug the 
USB hub into one of your Eee PC’s USB ports. This makes more ports (often 
four) available. Just remember, a single USB port puts out only a limited 
amount of power. You may need a self-powered hub that gets juice from its 
own power supply if you plan on using several USB devices that need power.

Bluetooth Blues
Bluetooth has turned into the de facto standard for short range wireless 
communications. Compatible cell phones, GPS receivers, mice, keyboards, 
laptops, PDAs, and other devices all use Bluetooth to exchange data over 
radio airwaves.
When the Eee PCs were first introduced, if you wanted Bluetooth support, 
you purchased a Bluetooth adapter that plugged into one of the mini-laptop’s 
USB ports. Starting with the Eee PC 901 and later models, ASUS begin includ-
ing built-in Bluetooth. (You can configure Bluetooth in the Linux Settings tab 
or the Windows XP Control Panel.)
If you want to add Bluetooth to your Eee PC, my recommendation is to go 
with one of the smallest Bluetooth adaptors around, made by Mogo — see 
Figure 16-4 comparing its size to a Logitech wireless mouse dongle.
With any Bluetooth adaptor, if you’re running Windows XP, first see if the 
device works by just plugging it in. If it doesn’t, follow the directions that 
came with the adaptor and install the correct driver.
If Bluetooth doesn’t come built-in, getting Bluetooth to work with a Linux Eee 
PC is a bit more complicated. You first enter some commands at the console 
and modify a system configuration file or two. You can find all the details at: 
http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:bluetoothdongles.
Expect to pay between $25 and $50 for a USB Bluetooth adaptor.
I saw the light
Some Eee PC users begin to develop a fear of 
the dark. Well, maybe not a fear but just a little 
dread. When the lights go out and you can’t 
clearly peek down at the keys, the number of 
typos starts to go up — unless you’re a very 
accomplished touch typist with lots of practice 
on the small keyboard. Yet another scary 
thought is using your mini-laptop for a presen-
tation in a darkened room, and continually 
hitting the wrong keys to advance to the next 
slide — been there, done that.
To quote the Robert Cray tune, “Don’t be afraid 
of the dark.” Instead, pick up a USB powered 
LED light. These handy little accessories are 
perfect for when the lights go down — LED 
bulbs also don’t consume much juice, so your 
battery doesn’t take too much of a power hit 
when you use them.
Most lights sport a flexible gooseneck that 
allows you to optimally position the beam. 
Depending on the model and features, prices 
range between $5 and $20. (I’d pass on the 
dollar store varieties, as they often use low-
quality LEDs and cheap goosenecks prone to 
breaking.)

Personalizing Your Eee PC
In Chapter 21, I present a number of ways you can personalize the user 
interface of your Linux Eee PC. If you want to express yourself even more, 
how about sprucing up the outside of your mini-laptop? You don’t need 
to be an artist to turn your ho-hum black or white Eee PC into a modern art 
masterpiece like the one shown in Figure 16-5.
The growing popularity of laptops (of all sizes) has spurred several compa-
nies to offer a variety of decals designed to uniquely personalize your PC. 
Commonly referred to as skins, these aren’t cheap “slap on your car” bumper 
stickers, but instead are quality vinyl decals with a reusable adhesive that 
doesn’t leave sticky goo when you pull them off. Priced around $20, they 
come in solid colors, fine art prints, nature scenes, you name it — you can 
even submit graphics files to create your own custom decals.
 
Figure 16-5: 
A Schtickers 
decal on 
an Eee PC.
 

256
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
Here are several skin sources to check out:
 
✓ Schtickers — www.schtickers.com
 
✓ DecalGirl — www.decalgirl.com
 
✓ GelaSkins — www.gelaskins.com
 
Most companies offer skins to fit standard laptop screen sizes. If the Eee PC 
isn’t listed, order a custom size. 8.5-x-5.5 inches should work for 700 and 900 
series models, with no extra cutting required.
 
If you’re a do-it-yourselfer and want to save a few bucks, invest in some inkjet 
adhesive vinyl sheets. Or take your artwork in PDF format to a commercial 
print shop (like FedEx/Kinkos) and have them print the file on an 8.5-x-11–inch 
clear adhesive label. Carefully cut the label to match your Eee PC’s dimen-
sions, and you have a custom skin for less than a couple of dollars. (Consider 
getting two labels, one for the skin and the other to stick over it as a protec-
tive layer.) The do-it-yourself approach works great with white Eee PCs, but 
leaves a little to be desired appearance-wise on the black models. If you have a 
black Eee PC you want to dress up, I’d recommend using opaque white labels.
Modem Madness
With wireless broadband and cable/DSL modems, dial-up modems seem like 
archaic relics of the past — “what’s that funny screeching noise?” But 
depending on the location, a dial-up modem may be the only way for some 
people to get Internet access. If you’re in that boat, read on.
Because the Eee PC doesn’t have a PC Card slot like many other laptops, you 
need a dial-up modem that plugs into one of the USB slots. These dial-up 
modems are readily available and cost in the $40-to-$50 price range.
If you’re running Windows XP on your mini-laptop, it’s usually just a matter 
of inserting the USB modem and configuring it in the Control Panel — 
depending on the modem, you may have to install a driver.
Getting a dial-up modem to work under Linux can be more of a challenge. 
Most USB modems have drivers only for Windows, and if they do have Linux 
drivers, these typically require a lot of configuration (including recompiling 
the kernel).
If you regularly use a dial-up modem with your Eee PC, I’d recommend a 
Windows XP mini-laptop just for ease of installation and use.

257
 Chapter 16: Essential Eee PC Accessories
If you’re set on running Linux, users have found success with the Zoom 3095 
V92 USB Mini modems — as shown in Figure 16-6. (It also works with 
Windows by the way). Just keep in mind you must do a fair amount of 
configuration to get it working. You can find details and a discussion of 
what’s required at this link: http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.

You may be able to use your cell phone as a modem with your Eee PC through 
a USB or Bluetooth connection. Search the EeeUser.com forums (http://
forum.eeeuser.com) for your phone model to see if there are instructions. 
If not, post a message to see if anyone has gotten a similar model phone 
working with the mini-laptop.

External Monitors and Projectors
In my opinion, the Eee PC makes the perfect laptop for training and presenta-
tions. It’s easy to bring the mini-laptop to meetings, classrooms, or confer-
ences; and with its VGA output, hooking the Eee PC up to external monitors 
and projectors is a snap.

258
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
In this section, I want to share a few tips for using external monitors and 
projectors — be sure to read Chapter 9, where I discuss how to change 
external monitor settings in Linux; for Windows, use Display in the Control 
Panel. I’ll start with monitors first.
External monitors
Whether you’re going to hook up your Eee PC to a desktop PC monitor or a 
big-screen TV, getting the best and most viewable display on an external 
monitor often is a trial-and-error process. Try a number of different monitor 
settings until you find the one that works the best. This is because the Eee PC 
supports only a limited number of screen resolutions.
Generally, a traditional monitor with a 4:3 screen ratio (square in shape) 
produces the best results. A more contemporary 16:9 ratio (widescreen) 
monitor may display a distorted image and require a bit more tweaking.
 
External monitor resolutions that aren’t compatible with the Eee PC produce 
distorted images. This is because the pixels are no longer square, but are 
elongated or squashed.
If you get a grainy or distorted picture, try another monitor setting until you 
get the best appearance.
Projectors
Up until a few years ago, presentation projectors were bulky and expensive 
devices. Prices and sizes have fallen, and now home theater and business 
projectors are readily available for under $1,000.
With the Eee PC, multimedia projectors (often called PowerPoint projectors) 
are a bit easier to deal with than external monitors because they only 
support several standard resolutions. It’s usually just a matter of plugging a 
projector into the mini-laptop so what’s displayed on the screen appears on 
the wall.
 
Always connect and power-on the external monitor or projector first and then 
start the Eee PC. If the mini-laptop is running when the display device is 
plugged in, it may not work correctly with the external device.

259
 Chapter 16: Essential Eee PC Accessories
I’ll be honest with you. From a presentation standpoint, Windows XP on the 
Eee PC is a better choice than Linux. This is because of its full support for 
Microsoft PowerPoint and a little better control in selecting screen resolution 
and settings.
Don’t get me wrong, I like OpenOffice, and it works great with basic Power-
Point presentations — in Chapter 5, I tell you all about using OpenOffice with 
PowerPoint files. But if you have a PowerPoint presentation with lots of multi-
media elements, OpenOffice can run into problems. If one of the primary uses 
of your Eee PC is going to be PowerPoint presentations, I’d lean toward a 
Windows XP model.
If you’re set on a Linux Eee PC and plan on using it for lots of presentations, 
there is a sneaky way to successfully use PowerPoint files that misbehave 
under OpenOffice. You need two pieces of software:
 
✓ Wine — Wine (www.winehq.org) is a program that allows Microsoft 
Windows programs to run under Linux. I discuss Wine in Chapter 13.
  
✓ PowerPoint Viewer — Microsoft’s PowerPoint Viewer is a handy 
utility that plays presentations on any computer running a copy of 
Windows XP (or Wine) — you don’t need a copy of Office, but remember 
you can’t create or edit files with Viewer. PowerPoint Viewer 2007 
works with Microsoft Office 2007 and earlier versions of PowerPoint 
presentations. (You can also download older viewers that work with 
earlier versions of Office — they tend to be smaller if you’re trying to 
conserve drive space.) Visit the Downloads section at http://office.
microsoft.com.
After you have Wine working, run PowerPoint Viewer and then open and start 
your presentation. All those multimedia effects that were misbehaving under 
OpenOffice should now work.
 
Creating presentations on the Eee PC can be a bit challenging because of 
the small screen and cramped keyboard. I typically build a presentation on 
a desktop PC or a full-size laptop and then copy it to the mini-laptop.
Staying Found with GPS
GPS (Global Positioning System) is hot these days. These handy little gadgets 
use satellite signals to tell you where you are and the best routes for getting 
between Point A and B. Although you can purchase a standalone GPS device 
designed for your car, you can also connect certain types of GPS receivers to 
your Eee PC so you never get lost (I hope).

260
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
The two types of GPS receivers you can use with your mini-laptop are
 
✓ USB — This is a GPS receiver that connects to the Eee PC’s USB port. 
The GPS device might not have a screen and might only send location 
data to the laptop. It could also be a handheld receiver primarily 
designed for outdoor use. GPS receivers with cables give you more 
latitude in mounting the device to get the best satellite reception. An 
example is shown in Figure 16-7.
 
✓ Bluetooth — If your Eee PC is Bluetooth enabled, a number of small 
receivers wirelessly send GPS data to your mini-laptop.
 
Figure 16-7: 
Eee PC 
connected 
to a USB 
GPS 
receiver.
 
After it is connected, the GPS receiver sends location data to a map program 
running on your Eee PC. The program displays your current position 
on a map and can optionally leave a breadcrumb trail (called a track) that 
shows where you’ve been. Most commercial programs allow you to enter 
an address, and the program plots and displays the best route for getting 
there including spoken directions. GPS data is also used to display current 
and average speed, distance traveled, and your destination’s estimated 
arrival time.
If you’re thinking about frequently putting your Eee PC to work as a portable 
navigation device, it’s easier and you have more options if you’re running 
Windows XP., Many more digital map programs are available for Windows 
than Linux. Windows’ popularity also ensures you can use the mini-laptop 
with just about any GPS receiver that can exchange data with a PC.
 
Older handheld GPS receivers use serial ports to communicate with PCs. The 
Eee PC doesn’t have a serial port, so you need a USB-to-serial port adaptor if 
you want to use a non-USB GPS receiver.

261
 Chapter 16: Essential Eee PC Accessories
 
There’s a whole lot more to GPS than I have the pages to devote to the 
subject. In fact, I wrote an entire book on GPS and digital maps. If you’re 
interested, be sure to check out GPS For Dummies, Second Edition (Wiley 
Publishing).
Linux GPS resources
Although it’s easier to use GPS with a Windows 
Eee PC, if you’re running Linux, there’s no need 
to feel lost. Here are some Linux-oriented GPS 
resources to steer to:
 ✓ Tuxmobil is the definitive source for 
anything (hardware or software) to do with 
GPS and Linux — http://tuxmobil.
org/linux_gps_navigation_
applications.html.
 ✓ Roadnav is an open-source Linux street 
navigation program — http://road
nav.sourceforge.net/.
 ✓ GPSDrive is a free program that supports 
street maps and satellite imagery — www.
gpsdrive.de/.
 ✓ gpsd (as in GPS daemon) is system 
software that allows a GPS receiver to 
interface with a map program — http://
gpsd.berlios.de/.
And finally, here’s a how-to tutorial that puts 
together all the pieces so you can get GPS 
working on your Eee PC — http://wiki.

Power to the Eee PC
In This Chapter
▶ ASUS, third-party, and universal batteries
▶ Cigarette lighter power adapters
▶ Automotive inverters
▶ Electricity from the sun
▶ Muscle power options
Just like any computer, your Eee PC needs power. No juice from a battery 
or an electrical outlet means your mini-laptop is now a nice, plastic 
paperweight, which isn’t really all that useful.
Most people find the battery and wall charger that are included with the Eee 
PC meet their basic power needs. But what if there’s no electric outlet 
nearby? What if you’re always on the go and a single battery doesn’t cut it for 
your computing needs?
You’re in luck because that’s what this chapter is all about. In it I explore 
ways you can power your Eee PC — both Linux and Windows varieties. I 
cover batteries (of all different types), charging and running your Eee PC 
while on the road (or in the air), and some off-the-grid options in case you’re 
headed for some place with limited or no power.
Read on for both useful and electrifying (sorry, I just couldn’t resist that pun) 
details.
The Juice on Batteries
Unlike a desktop PC that spends its entire life tethered to a power cord and 
electrical wall socket, your Eee PC is designed to go places. Thanks to its 
small size, you can use it just about anywhere. That is, as long as you’ve got a 
charged battery.

264
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
In this section, I give you the juice on batteries. Maybe, after lots of use, your 
Eee PC’s battery is starting to give up the ghost. Or perhaps you’ve found 
that one battery doesn’t do the trick on those transoceanic flights, long 
commutes, or day outings at the beach. If you need a battery, this is where to 
learn about your options.
ASUS batteries
If you’re shopping for a new Eee PC battery (your old one doesn’t seem to 
last very long and you need a replacement, or you’re considering a second 
battery so you can use your mini-laptop longer), you probably first turn 
to an ASUS brand battery, as shown in Figure 17-1.
This makes sense because you know a battery from the manufacturer is 
guaranteed to work with your Eee PC. Manufacturer batteries are also 
covered by warranties, whereas third-party batteries may not be.
 
Aside from eventually wearing out, it’s rare that laptop batteries have 
problems — there were those exploding Dell laptop batteries in 2006, but 
despite all the panic, relatively few actual cases were reported.
Battery Briefs
Here are some important facts to know about 
your Eee PC’s battery (or any laptop for that 
matter):
Cells — Even though they look like it, laptop 
batteries aren’t one big battery. They’re com-
posed of a series of cells (smaller, individual 
batteries) that are connected inside the sealed 
plastic case. More cells typically mean longer 
battery life, but also make the battery heavier.
mAh — This stands for milliampere-hour, a 
measurement of how much energy is stored in 
a battery. Generally, the more mAh, the longer 
the battery life. (Keep in mind that battery life 
depends on what you’re doing. An Eee PC with 
a lower mAh battery may run longer than the 
same Eee PC with a higher capacity battery — 
if you are word processing with the wireless 
card off rather than watching videos with a 
wireless Net connection.)
Battery Memory — You may have heard that 
batteries have memories and occasionally need 
to be fully discharged. Not true with Lithium Ion 
(Li-Ion) batteries, which most laptops use these 
days. They don’t have a memory (like older 
Nickel Cadmium batteries), and there’s no need 
to fully discharge them. Actually, to maximize 
battery life, Li-Ions should be charged when 
they’re down to around 50 percent.
Battery Life — Sooner or later, your battery is 
going to bite the dust. Batteries have a limited 
life span that depends on how many times 
they’ve been charged and how they’ve been 
maintained. As a battery starts to wear out, the 
amount of charge it holds slowly decreases 
until eventually it won’t power your laptop at all. 
Depending on use, expect a battery to last one 
to three years.

265
 Chapter 17: Power to the Eee PC
 
Figure 17-1: 
The Eee PC 
battery.
 
Currently, ASUS offers the following Lithium-Ion batteries for the 2G, 4G, 8G, 
and 900 models (these batteries can be used in any of these models).
 
✓ 4,400 mAh — 4 cell
 
✓ 5,200 mAh — 4 cell
 
✓ 5,800 mAh — 4 cell
For the 901 and 1000 models, ASUS offers this battery:
 
✓ 6,600 mAh — 6 cell
There have been reports that ASUS will be offering higher capacity batteries 
in the future, but at this time there are no firm details.
 
Batteries come in white and black. Be sure to order one that matches your Eee 
PC (unless you go for two-tone colors).
Generally, the more mAh (milliampere-hours), the longer the battery will 
last — and the more expensive it will be. Prices tend to range from $65 to 
$125 depending on capacity, and it’s worthwhile to shop around on the 
Internet for the best deal.

266
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
 
Although 4,400 mAh batteries are readily available as I write this, finding 
higher-capacity batteries can be a bit of a challenge. In March, 2008, a fire 
broke out at LG Chem’s Ochang, South Korea battery plant. This severely 
impacted ASUS, Dell, and HP laptop battery availability. (An earlier fire in 
October 2007 at a battery factory in Japan had already caused laptop battery 
shortages.) Supply issues should be ironed out by the end of the year.
 
Speaking of batteries, don’t miss out on Bonus Chapter 2 on the companion 
Web site (www.dummies.com/go/asuseeepcfd), where I give you tips on 
maximizing your Eee PC’s battery life.
Third-party batteries
An alternative to using ASUS-brand batteries is to go with a third-party 
battery. Many generic batteries use the same components as the original 
batteries that come with the laptops. They don’t have the brand-name on the 
label and are priced slightly lower because of reduced business overhead 
costs.
Third-party batteries typically have the same mAh ratings as manufacturer 
batteries, but also may be available in even higher-capacity models. For 
example, some third-party Eee PC batteries have a huge 10,400 mAh rating.
 
When buying batteries that have above normal capacity, always check a photo 
of the battery and its dimensions. In some cases the battery may be physically 
larger than the one that comes with your Eee PC — otherwise don’t expect 
a flush fit, since the bigger battery will stick out beyond the back of the mini-
laptop’s case.
Before you buy a third-party battery (especially from eBay), check the 
EeeUser.com forums (http://forum.eeeuser.com) to learn what people 
have to say about a particular battery and vendor. For example, Mugen 
Power Batteries (www.mugenpowerbatteries.info) has received a 
number of favorable reviews.
Universal batteries
Instead of purchasing a battery expressly built for your Eee PC, look into 
getting a universal battery. These external Lithium-Ion batteries can power 
all sorts of electronic devices — not just your Eee PC. Plug one into the mini-
laptop’s power jack (where you normally plug in the wall charger), and the 
Eee PC runs on the external battery until it discharges. When the external 
battery runs out, the Eee PC automatically starts using its internal battery. 
Pretty slick.

267
 Chapter 17: Power to the Eee PC
My favorite universal batteries are the Tekkeon MyPower All products (as 
shown in Figure 17-2). Two models are available:
 
✓ MP3450 — Provides up to 19 volts, has a USB charging port, and can be 
expanded with a spare battery pack. Priced around $130.
 
✓ MP3300 — A lower cost model without all the features of the MP3450, 
but still providing up to 14 volts of power.
Connected to an Eee PC 4G, the MP3450 provides around three and a half to 
four hours of power before the internal battery takes over. (You charge the 
MyPower All with an included AC or DC adapter.)
Universal batteries aren’t quite as lightweight and trim as the Eee PC’s 
internal battery (they’re still very portable though), but they do offer more 
functionality for right around the same price. They’re especially handy if you 
have another laptop or need to power other portable electronic devices.
For more information on the MyPower Alls, visit www.tekkeon.com/site/
products-mypowerall.php.
 
When I’m on the road I always carry a small, wall socket plug with multiple 
outlets. Public spots in airports for recharging electronic devices are always at 
a premium, and a multiple outlet plug lets you share the juice from a single 
outlet with other travelers.

Getting (Car) Charged Up
A car (or truck) can power your Eee PC or charge its battery — although 
with gas prices these days, it’s a pretty expensive generator. If you’re 
going to be on the road with your mini-laptop, you have two options for 
keeping it charged; a cigarette lighter adapter or an inverter. Here’s the 
lowdown on both.
Cigarette lighter adapters
Cigarette lighters first started appearing in cars in the 1920s — they were 
originally designed for lighting cigars; that’s why they’re the size they are. 
With the advent of modern automotive cigarette lighters in the 1950s, it 
became possible to use the 12-volt, direct current generated by a car to 
power electrical devices. By using a cigarette lighter adapter (CLA) like the 
one in Figure 17-3, you can run and charge your Eee PC.
 
CLAs have circuitry that converts the car’s 12-volt electricity into power that’s 
usable by the Eee PC. CLAs also have fuses to protect your mini-laptop in case 
a higher than normal amount of current comes through the lighter.

269
 Chapter 17: Power to the Eee PC
The popularity of the Eee PC is bringing many accessories to market, 
including CLAs. If you’re interested in a CLA, here are several possibilities 
(Google eee pc cigarette lighter for more):
 
✓ ASUS — ASUS sells Eee PC car chargers for $79 — check out the ASUS 
e-store at http://estore.asus.com.
 
✓ Brando — Brando is a large, Hong Kong–based supplier of electronics 
accessories. The company offers several Eee PC CLAs (be sure you get 
the right one for your particular model). At $18, not including shipping, 
the chargers are reasonably priced and have a good reputation. The 
only downside is shipping to the U.S. can take several weeks. For more 
information on the chargers and other Eee PC accessories, go to

✓ Radio Shack — If you have a local Radio Shack (www.radioshack.
com) store, stop by and pick up a High-Power Universal DC Adapter 
(Model 273-1818). You’ll also need an Adaptaplug C to fit the mini-laptop. 
Set the charger to the right voltage, and you’re ready to go. (The charger 
is a bit pricey at $38, plus $6.50 for the plug, but you can use it with lots 
of other electronic devices.)
 
If you use a multivoltage charger, be sure you use the correct voltage for your 
Eee PC. The 2G, 4G, and 8G models are expecting 9.5 volts with 2.315 amps. 
900, 901, and 1000 models need 12 volts at 3 amps. The mini-laptop’s power 
supply can handle a little over and under its rated voltage, but if you use too 
many volts, you risk damaging the computer. You also need to ensure the 
power tip is the correct polarity (in the Eee PC’s case, the tip is positive and 
the outer sleeve is negative). Always check a device’s user guide or online 
specifications to find out about its power requirements.
 
Some airlines offer DC power outlets in their seats (usually business and first 
class). If you do a lot of flying in addition to driving, CLA chargers are available 
that work in both car and plane receptacles.
Inverters
Another option for powering an Eee PC while on the road is to use an 
inverter. Inverters convert one type of voltage to another. For example, an 
automotive inverter converts a car’s 12-volt DC (direct current) to 120-volt 
AC (alternating current) — what comes out of standard United States 
electrical outlets.
Car inverters (two are shown in Figure 17-4) have one or more electrical 
outlets that work just like a wall socket. Just plug in any electrical device and 
you can run it from your car’s electrical system. (When the car is running, its 
battery is being charged, so you don’t need to worry about it discharging.)

Inverters are rated at different wattages. The more watts an inverter can 
handle, the more it costs. Make sure you have a large enough inverter to 
accommodate the device(s) you plan on using. Because Eee PCs draw well 
under 30 watts, you can use a relatively inexpensive (around $20) 75-watt 
inverter.
 
All electrical devices have an attached label that lists their wattage. If the 
device doesn’t show watts, but only lists volts and amps, use this simple 
formula: 
Watts = Volts × Amps
The advantage to an inverter is you can use a variety of electrical devices 
with it and not need special plugs or adapters. Inverters are available in the 
automotive or electronics sections of most large chain stores.
 
Many car inverters now come with USB jacks, so you can charge MP3 players 
and other devices.
Off-the-Grid Power Solutions
One of the Eee PC’s nicer features is its low energy use. Compared to a typi-
cal full-size laptop, the Eee PC is a frugal, gas-sipping hybrid (to continue with 
the analogy, a larger laptop is a mid-size economy car, and a desktop PC is a 
big, gas-gulping SUV).

271
 Chapter 17: Power to the Eee PC
 
According to my trusty Kill-A-Watt meter (www.p3international.com), an 
Eee PC 4G uses about 15 watts of power with wireless turned on and a video 
playing. (It uses under 10 watts with wireless off while doing less energy-
intensive tasks such as word processing). If I’m charging the battery while 
using the mini-laptop, I need 20 to 25 watts. By comparison, my full-size laptop 
consumes about twice as many watts as the mini-laptop. Even worse my 
desktop PC slurps an obscene ten times more power.
Low power consumption is important if you plan on taking your Eee PC to 
remote places without friendly public utilities that supply electricity. The Eee 
PC is well suited for situations like working for a humanitarian organization in 
the third world, living off the grid, or documenting a wilderness expedition.
In this section, I discuss renewable power sources for your Eee PC — perfect 
for when the closest wall socket may be a couple of hundred miles (or more) 
away. I focus on smaller and more portable approaches that generate a 
limited amount of electricity versus larger-scale technologies designed to 
power an entire house.
 
Two of my favorite e-tailers for portable renewable energy gadgets are Modern 
Output (www.modernoutpost.com) and Real Goods (www.realgoods.
com). If you’re even the slightest bit of a green geek, you’ll appreciate their 
online catalogs.
I saw the sine
The two types of inverters are true-sine wave 
and modified-sine wave. True-sine wave invert-
ers produce power like the kind you get from 
your electric company. When you look at the 
power wave through an oscilloscope, it appears 
as a smooth sine wave.
Modified-sine wave (also called square wave) 
inverters are the most common type of inverter. 
They’re considerably cheaper than true-sine 
inverters and produce more of a squared-off 
looking wave.
Modified-sine wave inverters work fine for 
powering laptops and most household 
appliances. True-sine inverters are required for 
devices that might have problems using an 
electrical current with a modified sine wave. 
These include fax machines, laser printers, 
plasma TVs, and other specialized devices.
There have been a few reports of Eee PC touch-
pads behaving erratically when plugged into 
an inverter. However the majority of people 
using inverters and laptops have never experi-
enced these problems. If your touchpad is 
misbehaving, this is likely a case of noisy power 
(originating from the inverter, the car’s electri-
cal system, or even the laptop). Try another 
inverter.

Solar
The thought of plugging your Eee PC into a solar panel and having the little 
laptop powered by the sun is certainly appealing. However it’s not that 
simple. You need to know a few things first. So here’s a quick introduction to 
using solar with your Eee PC.
Let’s start with solar panels. They come in all different sizes. First you need 
to figure out how big of a panel you’ll need. Solar panels are rated by the 
number of watts they produce — the bigger the panel, the more watts. 
Generally, the Eee PC uses about 15 watts while running under a full load, and 
25 watts under the same conditions if the battery is being charged. (The 
newer 901 and 1000 models use less with their frugal Atom processor.)
That means you need, at the very least, a 25-watt solar panel to directly 
power your mini-laptop while it’s running. It’s possible to use lower wattage 
solar panels to charge the Eee PC’s internal battery with the computer turned 
off. I wouldn’t recommend anything less than 15 watts though — the more 
watts the faster the charge. You can forget about small solar chargers 
designed for cellular phones and MP3 players because they produce well 
under 5 watts.
 
A solar panel’s rated wattage is the maximum amount of power produced 
under the most optimal conditions. That means direct, bright sunshine. Add 
some clouds and the watts starts to fall off — the more clouds the less power. 
Higher panel wattage ratings (the more watts, the higher the price and larger 
the panel) increase the chances you’ll get the power you need in less than 
optimal conditions.
Now that you know how many watts a solar panel needs to produce, it’s time 
to select the type of panel. You have two choices:
 
✓ Rigid — These are traditional solar panels enclosed by a frame and 
encased by glass or plastic. Because of their size and weight, they’re 
designed to be used in fixed locations. They’re typically connected to 
the battery that you use to power your electrical devices. You can get a 
30-watt panel for between $200 and $250. (Solar panel prices are starting 
to decline and will continue to fall due to technology advances and 
increased demand.)
 
✓ Flexible — Flexible solar panels (as shown in Figure 17-5) are designed 
for portability and can be rolled up or folded. They’re lighter and more 
compact, but can be up to double the price of a rigid panel for the same 
wattage (for example a Sunlinq 30-watt, foldable panel is priced over 
$500). Most of these portable solar chargers have a female, 12-volt 
cigarette lighter outlet, so if you have a cigarette lighter power adapter 
for your Eee PC, you can directly plug your mini-laptop into the panel. 
Popular flexible solar panel lines include Sunlinq (www.globalsolar.
com), SolarRolls (www.brunton.com), and PowerFilm (www.
powerfilmsolar.com).

273

After you’ve decided on a panel type, you next decide how you’re going to 
use it. The two general approaches to powering your Eee PC with the sun 
both require a cigarette lighter adapter.
 
✓ Directly from the panel — As long as you have enough sun (and 
wattage), your Eee PC is powered directly from the solar panel. 
If the watts drop below what you need, your internal battery starts 
supplying power.
 
✓ From an external battery — Your mini-laptop is getting its power from 
an external battery (12-volt or universal battery) that’s connected to a 
solar panel. The panel keeps the battery charged as the Eee PC draws 
power from the battery.
 
Although it’s possible to plug a 12-volt car inverter into the solar panel and 
then plug the Eee PC’s wall charger into the inverter, I don’t recommend this. 
Automotive inverters are inefficient and waste energy during the conversion 
process. When it comes to solar, waste not, want not — you want every bit of 
sunshine-derived power running and charging your laptop (or other devices).
If you’re using a solar panel to charge external batteries, you need something 
called a charge controller to place between the panel and the battery. The 
charge controller prevents overcharging. If you don’t use one, it’s possible to 
ruin the battery by pumping too much juice into it. You can purchase charge 
controllers for under $30 (even Amazon.com stocks them).

274
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
Depending on your needs, don’t discount the idea of using multiple solar 
panels. Many types of panels can be connected (this allows you to potentially 
get enough electricity from two smaller panels to keep your mini-laptop 
powered). Also, with several solar panels you can devote one to powering 
your Eee PC during the day, while another charges a 12-volt battery for 
nighttime use.
 
If you’re just looking to keep your Eee PC’s battery charged, check out 
products from Voltaic Systems (www.voltaicsystems.com). The company 
offers backpacks and messenger bags with built-in solar panels that can 
charge your laptop and other electronic devices as you transport them. 
They’re not cheap, but they’re pretty cool.
Because I only have a limited number of pages to tell you about using your 
Eee PC with the sun, here are a few online resources for additional general 
information on using solar power:
 
✓ Home Power Magazine — www.homepower.com
 
✓ SolarPower Forum — www.solarpowerforum.net
 
✓ OtherPower.com — www.fieldlines.com/section/solar
Solar battery basics
If you plan on using an external battery with a 
solar panel to keep your Eee PC charged, here 
are a few tips:
 ✓ Use a deep cycle marine or golf cart bat-
tery. These batteries are designed for stor-
ing power, unlike a car battery that’s 
primarily used for starting the engine.
 ✓ 12-volt solar batteries should never be dis-
charged to less than 50 percent of their 
total charge. If you run a battery below this 
level, you risk permanently damaging it.
 ✓ f you’re using a non-sealed battery, regu-
larly check the cells and make sure they’re 
topped off with distilled water. It’s easy to 
kill a battery if you don’t. (There’s more 
good information on battery maintenance at 
this site: www.wholesalesolar.
com/Information-SolarFolder/
battery.maintenance.html.)
 ✓ An alternative to a conventional battery is 
to use a Xantrex XPower Powerpack (www.
xantrex.com). These are portable, 
backup batteries that have built-in invert-
ers, gauges, lights, and air compressors. 
They can be charged with a solar panel or 
through a standard electrical outlet. 
Powerpacks come in a variety of capacities 
and are priced from around $75 up.

 Chapter 17: Power to the Eee PC
Human power
Solar is hot these days (literally), but you probably guessed the technology 
has some serious limitations when it’s dark or the skies are cloudy. If you’re 
located in an area where you can’t rely on getting power from the sun, an 
alternative to keeping your Eee PC powered up is to use good-old fashioned 
elbow-grease — by that I mean a gadget that produces electricity from you 
and your muscles. Here are several currently available options.
Weza
One of my favorite human-powered, electrical device manufacturers is 
Freeplay Energy (www.freeplayenergy.com). The company started out 
producing rugged, hand-crank radios for use in Africa and third-world 
countries. Since then, they’ve expanded their products to a number 
of different human-powered gadgets.
Of particular interest to off-the-grid Eee PC users is the Weza (a Swahili word 
that means power). Weza is built around a 12-volt lead-acid battery. You can 
charge the battery by plugging it into an electrical outlet or solar panel or by 
stepping on its foot treadle, as shown in Figure 17-6.
 
Figure 17-6:

276
Part IV: Hardware and Accessories for the Eee PC 
Plug an Eee PC equipped with a cigarette lighter adapter into the Weza to 
charge the mini-laptop’s internal battery. (You need to stomp on the Weza 50 
to 60 steps a minute to generate 30 watts of power. At that rate, to produce 
enough energy to charge a 5,200 mAh Eee PC battery, plan on an hour-and-15-
minute workout.)
You probably won’t want to take a Weza (weighing in at just a little less than 
18 pounds) backpacking with you, but it is a very viable, compact, human-
powered generator if weight isn’t an issue. If you shop around, you can find 
the Weza in the $200 to $250 price range.
FreeCharge 12V
If Weza is a bit too large, another Freeplay product to consider is the 
FreeCharge 12V (see Figure 17-7). This is a small, lightweight, 12-volt hand-
held generator. Attach a cigarette lighter adaptor to your Eee PC, plug it into 
FreeCharge, and start cranking (at 120 revolutions per minute or more).
OK, FreeCharge isn’t really designed to charge laptops — its main purpose is 
to give cell phones a quick hit of electricity. FreeCharge’s output is about half 
of the Weza’s, so figure somewhere between two to two-and-a- half hours of 
cranking to fully charge an Eee PC battery. I hope you have some friends 
around to help (and a massage therapist to take care of your arms the 
next day).

277
 Chapter 17: Power to the Eee PC
 
FreePlay Energy is working on a clamp-mounted charger for the OLPC-XO 
laptop (attaching a clamp to the FreeCharge would make it much easier and 
less taxing to use). Potenco, another alternative-energy company (www.
potenco.com), has developed a pull-cord power generator for the XO, which 
should be easier to use than a crank device. At this time, neither product is 
commercially available, but will be soon.
Pedal power
The least demanding human-powered way to run and charge your Eee PC is 
with a pedal-powered power source. This is a stationary bike hooked up to a 
generator. As you pedal, the generator creates electricity that you can use to 
directly power an electronic device or charge a 12-volt battery.
For more information on this option, check out these two sources:
 
✓ Windstream — This company produces a number of renewable energy 
products, including a bike power generator (the basic model is priced at 
$595). For details, go to www.windstreampower.com.
 
✓ Pedal-Powered Generator — If you’re more of a do-it-yourselfer, David 
Butcher has comprehensive information and plans for building your own 
bike generator. His Web site is at www.los-gatos.ca.us/davidbu/

espite its toy-like appearance and easy-to-use 
demeanor, beneath the surface of the Eee PC lurks a 
powerful computer, ready to be unleashed by a user with 
a little technical inclination.
In this part of the book, I present advanced Eee PC topics. 
Although you can be perfectly happy using an out-of-the-box 
version of the Eee PC, the little computer does lend itself to 
tinkering — especially when it comes to the operating 
system.
In the upcoming chapters I present the fundamentals of 
backing up and restoring your Eee PC, changing the 
appearance of the default Linux desktop, invoking a more 
powerful user interface known as Advanced Desktop 
Mode, and using the Linux command line.
Although some of this may sound daunting, I provide 
clear instructions and helpful resources for the average 
Eee PC user who likes to experiment and wants to go 
beyond the basics.

A
s you may have suspected from the title, this chapter is about backing 
up and restoring your Eee PC.
I know some people who are absolutely manic and compulsive about backing 
up their PCs, making complete copies of their hard drives every night. I also 
have a few laissez faire friends who never back up any of their files (and have 
yet to lose data after decades of using computers).
In my book, what you back up and how often you do it tend to be personal 
choices. I’m not going to get up on a soapbox and start harping about how 
and when you should back up your mini-laptop. That’s up to you.
Instead I want to tell you about the alternatives you have for backing up your 
Eee PC (both Linux and Windows models). I also want to cover what to do if 
your system somehow experiences a serious meltdown and you need to rein-
stall the operating system (it can happen).
Let’s start with looking at different backup strategies.

282
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
Eee PC Backup Strategies
Your primary desktop or laptop PC probably has at least a 100GB or larger 
hard drive. Due to the sheer volume of data, backing up these drives can be 
both time consuming and challenging (you may have said to yourself, “How 
many DVDs do I need to back up all these files?”).
Thankfully, the relatively small drive size (in all Eee PCs except those with 
conventional hard drives) makes backing up the mini-laptop fairly quick and 
easy. A full backup of your system is measured in minutes versus hours and, 
depending on the method you use, is usually fairly painless.
Two backup approaches to consider are copying individual files and folders 
and imaging the Eee PC’s drive. Here’s the lowdown on each.
Copying files and folders
This is the most straightforward approach and best for the casual backer-
upper. You just copy files you’ve saved on the Eee PC’s drive to external stor-
age media such as a USB thumb drive, SD card, or even over a network to a 
shared directory on another computer. There are two ways to do this:
 
✓ File Manager: On a Linux Eee PC, use File Manager; with Windows, use 
Explorer (the file explorer, not Internet Explorer, the Web browser). 
Simply select and drag (or copy and paste) the files and/or directories 
you want to back up.
 
 On Linux Eee PCs, settings and data for many programs are stored in 
hidden directories in the Home directory. In File Manager’s View menu, 
select the Show Hidden Files and Show All File Systems items to see all 
files. You can then back up these files and folders by copying and pasting.
 
 If you’re a Windows Eee PC user, I recommend a free program called 
MozBackup for backing up Firefox and Thunderbird settings and data. 
Download it at http://mozbackup.jasnapaka.com. Additional 
Windows XP backup-related tools and tutorials can be found at this 
site: www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/learnmore/
bott_03july14.mspx.
 
✓ Command line: Use a Linux shell script or a Windows command line 
script (depending on the operating system you’re running) to automate 
the copying process. With scripts you can do all sorts of cool stuff like 
incremental and timed backups. I discuss the basics of command-line 
Linux in Chapter 20. For Windows, check out http://command
windows.com for more information about old-school, DOS batch 
file–style commands.

283
 Chapter 18: Backing Up and Restoring the Eee PC
After you’ve copied your files, you can restore them by using File Manager 
or Explorer (or a script if you’re more technically adept) to move the copied 
files back to your Eee PC. Or open and edit any documents on another com-
puter if, perish the thought, your Eee PC is broken, lost, or stolen.
Imaging the drive
An alternative to copying individual files and directories is to image your Eee 
PC’s drive. You use a program that creates a byte-by-byte mirror image of the 
drive contents. If you ever need to restore your Eee PC, the program writes 
the saved image back to the drive. The advantage to this method is every-
thing is saved; including files, the operating system and settings, installed 
programs and their settings, too. It takes a little longer than individually 
copying files, because every byte on the drive is duplicated, but it’s the gold 
standard for data insurance.
Several Linux and Windows imaging programs for mirroring your Eee PC’s 
drive are listed in the following sections.
Linux
At the present, there really aren’t any user-friendly, click-a-single-button 
imaging programs for Linux Eee PCs. If you want to mirror your drive, here 
are two best bets:
 
✓ dd: dd (which stands for Data Definition, although many people believe 
it’s Data Dump) is a utility program found in all versions of Linux. It 
copies and converts raw data. It is what most techies use for imaging 
drives. If you’re mostly a point-and-clicker and aren’t interested in using 
the command line, this option isn’t for you. If you want to learn how to 
Online backup options
With the introduction of the Eee PC 901, ASUS 
began offering users 20GB of secure online 
storage on some mini-laptop models (complete 
details are in your user manual). This added 
online storage certainly helps, considering 
the mini-laptop’s small drive size, plus it offers 
another option for backing up critical files.
ASUS is not the only game in town when it 
comes to online storage. In fact, online backup 
services are big business these days. In the next 
decade it is estimated 70 to 75 percent of all PCs 
will be using some form of online storage.
If you’re considering using online storage, 
whether ASUS’s offering or another, check 
out a Web site called Backup Review (www.
backupreview.info), which provides 
information and ratings on many online storage 
services.

284
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
use dd, however, you can find a great tutorial at the EeeUser.com Wiki: 
http://wiki.eeeuser.com/backup_restore.
 
 You can’t image a drive with dd if the operating system on the drive is 
running. The solution is to install some other version of Linux on a USB 
thumb drive, use it to boot, and then run dd from the thumb drive to 
mirror the internal Eee PC drive. If you have enough storage capacity, 
USB thumb drives and SD cards work great for saving the image. I per-
sonally like USB hard drives because they offer more space and aren’t as 
easy to lose or misplace.
 
✓ EeeBackup: If command-line dd sounds a bit intimidating, try an alterna-
tive called EeeBackup. This program installs on a USB thumb drive and 
has options to back up and restore full disk images or individual parti-
tion images. It also has several rescue utilities in case the backup pro-
gram doesn’t work. With compression, an image of a 4GB drive is around 
2GB and takes around 20 minutes to make. EeeBackup has a text inter-
face, but is simple to use (especially compared to dd). To download the 
utility and get more information go to this site: www.glost.eclipse.
co.uk/gfoot/eee/eeebackup/.
 
There’s a good tutorial for using EeeBackup at http://wiki.eeeuser.
com/backup_procedure_for_eee_with_xandros.
Windows
If you’re running Windows on your Eee PC, I recommend two drive-imaging 
programs:
 
✓ Acronis True Image: A number of commercial Windows drive-mirroring 
products are on the market, but in my opinion the best is Acronis’ True 
Image. The program is easy to use and comes with an amazing number of 
features. The $49.99 price tag is cheap data insurance (a free trial version is 
also available). You can download and learn more at www.acronis.com.
 
✓ Macrium Reflect: If you don’t want to shell out the bucks for True 
Image, check out Macrium’s Reflect. It has basic features without all the 
whistles and bells of True Image, but it gets the job done for free. For 
more information, visit: www.macrium.com/ReflectFree.asp.
Restoring Linux Factory Settings with F9
Sometimes, installing a new program, updating the system, or poking around 
not knowing fully what you’re doing (especially if you’re a novice), can make 
the Linux operating system unstable (to be fair, these actions can have the 
same results in Windows). If this happens, don’t panic.

285
 Chapter 18: Backing Up and Restoring the Eee PC
ASUS incorporated a slick-and-easy way to restore the Linux operating 
system to its default, fresh-from-factory state. Just press F9 during start-up 
and, in less than a minute, the mini-laptop is restored to its original condi-
tion (the operating system that is — F9 isn’t designed to recover your Eee PC 
from an accidental drop out of a second story window).
In many cases, you won’t need to worry about plugging in a recovery DVD 
and waiting around for the operating system to be fully reinstalled, as you 
would with other computers.
 
F9 does not perform a restore on Eee PCs running Windows XP or other ver-
sions of Linux.
This magic is thanks to something called UnionFS (read the “State of the 
UnionFS” sidebar for details). A read-only copy of the operating system and 
preinstalled files are kept on the drive and are always available for a restore.
That means if you installed some new software or changed a system setting 
that’s making your operating system misbehave, you can quickly get things 
back to normal by using F9.
 
The downside to an F9 restore is you lose all the files you’ve saved on the 
mini-laptop’s internal drive, any new programs you’ve installed, and whatever 
system settings you’ve changed. All this data is stored on the user-space drive 
partition that’s cleared during a restore.
Before you perform an F9 restore, make sure you save any files you want to 
keep. (Some users, who like to experiment with the operating system, save all 
their files to an SD card. Because an F9 restore doesn’t affect documents on 
an SD card or USB thumb drive, there’s no worry over losing files.)
Here’s how to do an F9 restore:
 
1. After you’ve powered on or rebooted, when the Eee PC start-up screen 
is first displayed, immediately press and hold the F9 key.
 
 A text window is shown with three choices (use the arrow keys to 
choose an option and Enter to select). When this window appears, you 
can release F9.
 
 Timing is a little critical on when to press F9. If you don’t get it right the 
first time, restart, and then rapidly (and repeatedly) press F9 when you 
see the start-up screen.
 
2. Select Restore Factory Settings.
 
 If you decide not to do the restore, choose Normal boot to continue.
 
3. A message warns you that you are about to restore the Eee PC to fac-
tory settings, and all user data will be lost. Type yes and press Enter to 
continue with restoring.

286
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
 
 This is your last chance before user data is erased. If you enter some-
thing other than yes, the Eee PC reboots as normal with all your data 
retained.
 
4. The Eee PC is restored to its factory settings. Press Enter to reboot.
When the mini-laptop reboots, it’s just like the first time you got the com-
puter and turned it on. Briefly, here is what happens next:
 
1. The license agreement shows.
 
 If you want to use the Eee PC, you need to agree to it.
 
2. Specify the keyboard layout (such as English/US).
 
3. Enter your name (or whatever you want the computer to be called).
 
4. Enter a password to use.
 
 The second text box is for confirming the password in the first text box; 
just in case you make a typo.
 
5. Specify whether you want to be logged in automatically (checked by 
default).
 
 Uncheck this option to require a password whenever the Eee PC starts up.
 
6. Enter your time zone, the correct date, and the local time.
Your Eee PC starts up, and you’re back in business.
State of the UnionFS
700 and 900 series Linux Eee PCs come installed 
with a file system service known as UnionFS 
(later Eee PC models use Aufs, which is based 
on UnionFS with some improvements). ASUS 
uses UnionFS and Aufs as part of its F9 system 
recovery scheme. It works like this.
Linux Eee PCs have four drive partitions. The 
first partition (/dev/sda1) contains a read-only 
version of the operating system. The second 
partition (/dev/sda2) is the read-write user parti-
tion which is mounted on top of the first partition 
using UnionFS or Aufs. (The other two partitions 
are small, unused Windows FAT partitions.)
Any files you save or changes you make to 
the operating system are written to the user 
partition. When you use F9, the second parti-
tion is erased (losing all your changes and files), 
leaving the read-only first partition still intact. 
It’s a little like a fresh start, without needing 
to reformat the entire drive and reinstall the 
operating system.
The downside to this scheme is it consumes 
more drive space. Because the first partition is 
read-only, you can’t delete any unwanted prein-
stalled programs to free up space. Additionally, 
when you update a program with a new version, 
you end up with two copies — the read-only 
original version on the first partition and the 
updated version on the second partition.

 Chapter 18: Backing Up and Restoring the Eee PC
Using the Linux Recovery DVD
If you can’t fix things with an F9 restore or your Eee PC refuses to boot, it’s 
time to break out the recovery DVD that came with your Linux mini-laptop.
The DVD contains everything you need to perform a complete system restore 
(this includes reformatting the drive and installing the operating system and 
preinstalled programs).
You can use the recovery DVD to
 
✓ Create a bootable USB recovery thumb drive (this is handy if you don’t 
have or don’t want to purchase a compatible USB DVD drive to use with 
the Eee PC).
 
✓ Boot the Eee PC and reinstall the operating system (obviously you need 
a DVD drive for this).
The following sections give you the lowdown on each of these options.
 
Always back up any files you want to keep before performing a system 
reinstallation with the DVD or a USB recovery drive. A system recovery 
involves formatting the internal drive, and all files and programs on the 
drive are erased.
USB recovery thumb drives
With a USB recovery thumb drive, you can perform a complete system rein-
stall of your Eee PC without attaching a DVD drive to the mini-laptop. All the 
recovery files you need are copied from the DVD to a USB thumb drive. The 
thumb drive is formatted so it can boot the Eee PC.
You need a Windows PC with a DVD drive and a USB thumb drive (2GB or 
larger). When you’re ready, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert a 2GB or larger USB thumb drive into a PC that’s running 
Windows XP or later.
 
 All the data is erased on the USB drive, so be sure to back it up.
 
2. Insert the Recovery DVD into the Windows PC.
 
 AsusSetup.exe should automatically start. If it doesn’t, find it on the 
DVD and run the program.
 
3. Click the Utilities tab and select ASUS Linux USB Flash Utility (as 
shown in Figure 18-1).

288
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
 
Figure 18-1:

4. Choose the USB drive to copy the Linux files to, select Copy Eee PC 
image files to USB flash and make it bootable, and click Run (as shown 
in Figure 18-2).
 
Figure 18-2:

the USB 
thumb drive

5. A dialog box is displayed that warns you the USB drive will be format-
ted. Click Yes to continue and follow the instructions.
A few minutes go by and the utility creates your USB Linux recovery drive. 
You can use it immediately or store it in a safe place until you need it.

289
 Chapter 18: Backing Up and Restoring the Eee PC
 
The utility formats the USB drive so that it is Linux bootable. If you want to 
use the drive for transferring data with another Windows PC, reformat the 
thumb drive. Run the program you used to create the recovery drive but 
select the Format the USB flash disk back to Windows format (FAT16) option (as 
shown in Figure 18-2). This reformats the drive so you can use it for storing 
files again.
After you’ve created the USB recovery drive, follow these steps to use it to 
reinstall the Linux operating system on your Eee PC:
 
1. After you’ve powered on or rebooted, when the Eee PC start-up screen 
is displayed, immediately press and hold ESC.
 
 This displays the boot device window (when you see the window, you 
don’t need to press ESC any longer). You can select whether to boot 
from the internal drive, or (depending on what’s plugged in) an SD card, 
a USB thumb drive, DVD player, or hard drive.
 
2. Select the USB drive thumb drive.
 
 Some status messages are displayed about Linux being loaded.
 
3. When you’re asked if you want to image the drive, type yes and press 
Enter to continue.
 
 If you type anything else, the reinstallation ends and the system reboots 
normally. Otherwise, the program starts to copy data from the USB drive 
and writes it to the Eee PC’s internal drive. (Status information about 
progress isn’t displayed aside from a message saying the process takes 
about five minutes; I’ve found it usually takes less.)
 
 If you have files on your Eee PC that you forgot to back up, this is your 
last chance to stop the reinstallation so you can copy the files.
 
4. When the reinstallation is complete, press Enter to reboot.
 
 After the reboot, enter your name, password, and other information, just 
as you did when you powered on your Eee PC for the first time.
Recovering with the DVD
Reinstalling the operating system from the recovery DVD is the same basic 
process as using a USB thumb drive that I describe in the previous section. 
The only difference is that instead of plugging in the recovery thumb drive 
you created, you use the DVD directly with a DVD drive connected to your 
mini-laptop.
To reinstall Linux with the DVD, follow these steps.

290
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
 
1. Connect a compatible USB DVD drive to your Eee PC.
 
 I discuss DVD drives in Chapter 15.
 
2. Insert the recovery DVD into the drive.
 
3. Turn on the Eee PC. When the mini-laptop’s start-up screen is dis-
played, immediately press and hold ESC.
 
 The boot device window is displayed (you can release the ESC key now). 
Select the DVD drive as shown in Figure 18-3.
 
Figure 18-3: 
Selecting a 
DVD drive 
as the boot 
device.
 
 
4. When you’re asked if you want to image the drive, type yes and press 
Enter to continue.
 
 I don’t want to belabor the point, but did you copy any files on the 
internal drive that you want to save? If not, type something other 
than yes.
 
5. When the reinstallation is complete, press Enter to reboot.
 
 Enter your name, a password and other information, just as when you 
first got your Eee PC.
Using the Windows Recovery DVD
If your Eee PC came preinstalled with Windows XP, a support DVD is included 
with your mini-laptop. The disc has drivers, utilities, and various programs, 
as well as an image of the Windows operating system.
To use the DVD to perform a system recovery, you need a DVD drive to con-
nect to your Eee PC (I discuss selecting a DVD drive in Chapter 15).

291
 Chapter 18: Backing Up and Restoring the Eee PC
 
Unlike the Linux recovery DVD, the Windows version doesn’t allow you to 
create a bootable USB recovery thumb drive.
 
If your Windows Eee PC crashes, it won’t boot. If you have important files on 
the drive that you haven’t backed up, consider this alternative before you 
bite the bullet and perform a system reinstall. Install a version of Linux on a 
USB thumb drive and try booting from it. In many cases you can successfully 
copy files from the unbootable internal drive before you format it and reinstall 
Windows. I discuss using different versions of Linux with the Eee PC and how 
to do this in Bonus Chapter 1.
The following list shows you how to perform a complete Windows reinstalla-
tion. There are a fair number of steps, but it’s all pretty straight forward.
 
1. Plug a USB DVD drive into your Eee PC.
 
2. Insert the Windows recovery DVD into the drive.
 
3. Turn on the Eee PC. At the start-up screen, press F2 to enter the BIOS 
setup.
 
4. Use the right-arrow key to display the Advanced tab.
 
5. Use the down-arrow key to highlight OS Installation and then press 
Enter.
 
 This displays an Options window with two choices, Finished and Start.
 
6. Use the down-arrow to select Start and then press Enter.
 
7. Use the arrow keys to highlight Onboard Devices Configuration and 
ensure all the devices all enabled.
 
8. Press F10 to save the change and reboot.
These steps prepare the BIOS for the operating system to be installed. Now 
it’s time to install the Windows disk image, so right after the mini-laptop 
reboots, follow these steps:
 
1. When the Eee PC’s start-up screen is displayed, immediately press and 
hold ESC.
 
 The boot device window is displayed (you can release the Esc key now). 
Select the DVD drive (as shown in Figure 18-3).
 
2. You’re prompted to press any key to start the recovery.
 
3. A window appears and asks if you want to continue. Click OK. 
Another window is displayed querying you one more time if you want 
to proceed. Click Yes.
 
 Are you really, really sure you want to continue? If you haven’t backed 
up files that you want to keep, now is a very good time to say No.

292
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
 
4. When the operating system installation is complete, you’re asked to 
remove the DVD and restart your Eee PC. Click OK to reboot.
You’re not quite done yet though. You still need to change a setting in the 
BIOS, just as you did at the beginning. After the reboot, follow these steps:
 
1. When the start-up screen appears, press F2 to enter the BIOS setup.
 
2. Use the right-arrow key to display the Advanced tab.
 
3. Use the down-arrow key to highlight OS Installation and then press 
Enter.
 
4. Use the down-arrow to select Finished and press Enter.
 
5. Press F10 to save the change and reboot.
That does it. Windows XP has been reinstalled, and your Eee PC is now just 
as it was when you took it out of the box.

A Real Desktop: Advanced Mode
In This Chapter
▶ Differences between Easy and Advanced Modes
▶ Enabling Advanced Mode
▶ Using Advanced Mode
▶ Uninstalling Advanced Mode
O
ut of the box, Linux Eee PCs come with a simple, tabbed user interface. 
Programs are grouped together by type in a series of tabs, and when 
you click an icon a program runs. You can’t get much simpler than that.
This simple user interface fits with the design goal of the Eee PC being an 
easy-to-use computing appliance (in fact, the interface is even called Easy 
Mode). And although the mini-laptop doesn’t use the more familiar desktop 
metaphor found in Windows, Mac, or other versions of Linux, it still enables 
you to get all your work (or play) done quickly and efficiently.
However, some users just can’t get used to the simplicity of Easy Mode, and 
think they need more of a grown-up–looking operating system. If that sounds 
like you, you’ve come to the right place. In this chapter, I tell you about an 
undocumented Linux Eee PC feature called Advanced Mode.
Advanced Mode (also known as Full Desktop) gives you access to a complete 
KDE desktop, including a real desktop with movable icons, a taskbar with a 
start menu, overlapping program windows, and lots of customization options.
Read on to find out about the differences between Easy and Advanced 
Modes, how to install and uninstall Advanced Mode, how to use the KDE 
desktop. You also pick up some tips for switching back and forth between the 
two modes.

294
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
Differences between Easy 
and Advanced Modes
A picture is worth a thousand words (or something like that), so to begin 
explaining the differences between Easy and Advanced Modes, take a look at 
Figure 19-1, which shows the default, Easy Mode interface that comes with 
Linux Eee PCs. If you’ve read other chapters in the book, you should be very 
familiar with it by now.
 
Figure 19-1: 
Linux Eee 
PC default 
Easy Mode.
 
Now cast your eyes on Figure 19-2, which shows Advanced Mode running. 
Wow, some difference, eh? It’s a real computer!
The same Linux operating system is running and all the programs and files 
are the same, but the Easy Mode appliance-like user interface has been 
replaced by a more familiar, desktop-oriented, KDE user interface.
 
If the Eee PC is your first experience with Linux, most modern versions of 
the operating systems have full desktop interfaces that are similar to KDE in 
Advanced Mode. The Easy Mode interface is exclusive to ASUS Eee PCs.

295
 Chapter 19: A Real Desktop: Advanced Mode

Advanced Mode advantages
Some of the reasons to consider using Advanced Mode include
 
✓ More familiar, desktop interface
 
✓ Access to more programs and greater functionality
 
✓ Customizable background and themes
Advanced Mode disadvantages
Advanced Mode is not without its disadvantages, and you should be aware of 
a few of the drawbacks:
 
✓ Must be installed (although not it’s not that difficult, as you’ll soon see)
 
✓ Uses more memory
 
✓ Takes up a little more drive space (under 10MB)
 
✓ Requires slightly longer start-up and shutdown times
 
✓ On a small screen, the desktop metaphor gets a bit cramped
 
✓ Is unsupported by ASUS

296
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
 
That last item is a big one. Don’t expect technical support from ASUS if you 
enable Advanced Mode. Easy Mode comes installed for a very good reason. If 
you’re a Linux newbie and start playing with things that you don’t understand 
in Advanced Mode, you can easily mess up your system, perhaps requiring an 
F9 system restore as I describe in Chapter 18.
Enabling Advanced Mode
If you’re interested in giving Advanced Mode a try, you have two simple ways 
to enable Advanced Mode on your Eee PC.
 
Actually, there are several other methods too. If you want to check them 
all out, visit the EeeUser.com Wiki entry on the subject at http://wiki.
eeeuser.com/howto:getkde. 
Using pimpmyeee
In Chapter 21, I discuss customizing the Eee PC’s user interface (especially 
in Easy Mode), and mention several tools and utilities. One of them is a shell 
script named pimpmyeee (that’s not a word in a foreign language word; 
instead it’s a run-on filename that translates out to pimp my eee pc).
 
A shell script is a like a DOS or Windows batch file. It’s a text file that contains 
a number of commands that automate some process (you can open up the 
pimpmyeee shell with a word processor, if you’d like, and examine the 
commands). Shell scripts typically run in the console and have a simple text 
interface.
One of the features of this particular customization shell script is enabling 
Advanced Mode. If you don’t already have pimpmyeee, you can download it 
with your Web browser from http://code.google.com/p/pimpmyeee/ 
(right-click the file link and Save link as).
In addition to the shell script, you also need a connection to the Internet. 
After you have both, follow these steps:
 
1. Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a console session.
 
2. Enter sh pimpmyeee-1.0.2.sh.
 
 Or depending on the version, whatever the filename of the latest script 
is. You’re greeted with several options. You want the one that says 
F - Enable Full Desktop (KDE).

297
 Chapter 19: A Real Desktop: Advanced Mode
 
3. Enter F as your choice.
 
 Some messages scroll by and, if you are successful, the last message 
reads Full desktop enabled. It takes less than a minute for all the files to 
download and be installed.
 
4. Press Enter to return to the shell script and then enter Q to quit.
That’s it, Advanced Mode is now installed. You can now close the console 
window.
Manually installing
Although shell scripts make life easy, unless you take the time to open them 
in a text editor, you don’t know what they’re doing. (I always recommend 
looking at a shell script before running it. As a Linux novice you may not 
know all the commands, but at least you have a general sense of what’s going 
on inside.)
I want to show you how to manually install Advanced Mode. If you’ve read 
Chapter 12 on installing Linux software, some of this should look familiar. 
Remember, you need an Internet connection.
 
If you’ve added any repositories for installing other programs, before install-
ing Advanced Mode I suggest you enable only the default ASUS repositories 
and disable any others (you can use Synaptic Package Manager to do this). 
This ensures you get the files you need from the right place. I tell you all about 
this in Chapter 12.
Follow these steps (coincidentally, these are the same commands that 
pimpmyeee uses, too):
 
1. In a console window enter sudo bash.
 
2. Enter apt-get update.
 
 This updates the package repository information; just in case you 
disabled any other non-default repositories as I suggested earlier.
 
3. Enter apt-get install ksmserver kicker.
 
 ksmserver is KDE’s session manager. When the computer starts up, the 
session manager launches auto-start programs and restores programs 
from the previous session. kicker is the main KDE panel that contains 
the taskbar and system tray. You are installing the Eee PC–specific 
versions of these two packages that allow you to run Advanced Mode.

298
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
 
4. Watch the status messages and reply Y (for yes) to any questions.
If no error messages appear, less than a minute goes by and Advanced Mode 
has successfully been installed.
Running Advanced Mode
After you installed Advanced Mode, you probably noticed that nothing 
happened. The big icons of Easy Mode are still happily staring up at you. 
No worries; you didn’t make a mistake. Here are two ways to switch over to 
Advanced Mode:
 
✓ In the desktop Settings tab, click the Instant Shutdown icon,
 
✓ In the taskbar, click the Shut Down icon.
The Shutdown window appears, but a new button appears at the far left 
labeled Full Desktop (as shown in Figure 19-3). Yep, you guessed it. Click the 
Full Desktop button to run Advanced Mode — first, be sure to close any 
programs that are running. Well what are you waiting for?
 
Figure 19-3: 
The Full 
Desktop 
button

Shutdown 
window.
 
After you enter Advanced Mode and the full desktop, you can return to Easy 
Mode with one quick menu selection.

299
 Chapter 19: A Real Desktop: Advanced Mode
 
I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but be careful with Advanced 
Mode. Loading it won’t hurt your system; it’s just the standard user interface 
to the same operating system. However, blindly playing with settings in this 
mode is probably the leading cause of Eee PC headaches and frustration for 
many Linux novices — and may require a F9 system restore. The Eee PC is 
fast and rock solid in Easy Mode (that’s what I use most of the time). Do you 
absolutely need to run Advanced Mode to perform day-to-day tasks? The 
answer for most people is no.
Using Advanced Mode
I don’t have the space to give you a detailed tutorial on using KDE (entire 
books and Web sites are devoted to subject), but I do want to give you some 
basic directions for getting started.
Navigating KDE
The full KDE desktop is very intuitive to use if you’ve had some experience 
with Windows or Mac. Here are a few quick tips for finding your way around.
 
✓ Double-click the Home icon to run File Manager and display your Home 
directory.
 
✓ Click the Launch button to display a pop-up menu with programs. This 
is similar to the Windows Start button.
 
✓ To access File Manager in Administrator mode, in order to perform 
file operations with administrative privileges, click the Launch button 
and select Applications➪System➪Administrator Tools➪File Manager 
(Administrator).
 
✓ To customize the desktop (including changing colors, wallpaper, and 
themes), click the Launch button and select Control Center. Click the 
Display icon and choose Background, Panel/Taskbar, Screen Saver, or 
Theme to change desktop settings and appearance. You can also right-
click the desktop and select Properties from the pop-up menu.
 
Check out the KDE Eyecandy Web site at www.kde-look.org/ for a variety 
of custom themes and backgrounds. You can preview and download some of 
these directly from the Control Center.
 
✓ To the right of the clock in the taskbar, click the blue arrow to hide the 
taskbar. Click it again to restore the taskbar.

300
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
 
✓ Right-click the Launch button to edit and configure the taskbar and 
programs in the Launch pop-up menu.
 
✓ The two rectangles in the taskbar numbered 1 and 2 are desktops. One 
of Linux’s standard features is multiple desktops. With multiple desk-
tops, you can run one or more programs in one desktop and additional 
programs in the other desktop. This reduces screen clutter. 
 
✓ To return to Easy Mode, click the Launch button and select Easy Mode.
 
✓ To shutdown or restart, click the Launch button and select Logout user.
 
To access KDE’s online help system, click the Launch button and then select 
Help (look for the lifesaving ring icon). Or, for much, much more detail on 
using KDE, check out the official User Guide at http://docs.kde.org/
development/en/kdebase-runtime/userguide/index.html.
Booting into Advanced Mode
After installing Advanced Mode, if you want to automatically boot into it 
instead of Easy Mode when your Eee PC starts up, here’s how:
 
1. Return to Easy Mode.
 
2. In the Settings tab, click the Personalization icon.
 
3. Under Login Mode, select Full Desktop Mode.
 
 This option (as shown in Figure 19-4) is only available when Advanced 
Mode is installed. You won’t see it otherwise.
 
4. Click OK.
 
Figure 19-4: 
Setting up 
Full Desktop 
Mode in the 
Personal-
ization 
dialog.
 

301
 Chapter 19: A Real Desktop: Advanced Mode
The next time you turn on or restart your mini-laptop, Advanced Mode loads 
and runs. If you decide you’d rather start up in Easy Mode, just go back into 
Personalization and change the Login Mode setting.
 
Two small drawbacks to this technique are that, first, the system double 
boots; it starts Easy Mode and then it loads Advanced Mode. That means 
slower start-up times. The second issue occurs if you move any file icons 
onto the desktop in Advanced Mode. Each time you reboot, the icons disap-
pear (the files are still on drive though). The way to address both of these 
problems is to modify certain system configuration files. For instructions on 
how to do this, go to the EeeUser.com Wiki at http://wiki.eeeuser.com/
howto:getkde. If you visit the site with your Eee PC, you can easily copy 
the required changes from the Web page and paste the text directly into the 
system files you need to edit.
Uninstalling Advanced Mode Files
In the event you want to uninstall the Advanced Mode files (let’s say you 
find you aren’t using the full desktop very much), it’s a simple process. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Return to Easy Mode.
 
2. Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a console session.
 
3. In a console window enter sudo bash.
 
4. Enter apt-get remove ksmserver kicker.
 
 This removes ksmserver and kicker which are required for Advanced 
Mode to run.
 
5. Enter Y to continue.
 
 Status messages appear and in less than 10 seconds Advanced Desktop 
is no more. To double check, shut down. The Full Desktop button should 
no longer appear in the Shutdown window.
 
There is an uninstall version of pimpmyeee called unpimpmyeee, but it 
doesn’t remove the Advanced Mode files.
 
If you ever perform an F9 system restore or have to restore your Eee PC from 
the recovery DVD, you must reinstall the Advanced Mode files.

Command-Line Linux
In This Chapter
▶ Reasons to use command-line Linux
▶ Choosing between xterm and Konsole
▶ Clueing in on console concepts
▶ Basic Linux commands and references
W
hen dinosaur operating systems ruled the earth, you instructed a 
computer what to do by typing in commands at a terminal keyboard 
(before that you used punch cards, but we’re not going to set the Wayback 
Machine that far back today).
In those days, UNIX, DOS, and just about every other operating system didn’t 
have user-friendly desktops. Instead, they had a Command-Line Interface 
(CLI), which required you to memorize all sorts of arcane commands. 
Thankfully, those days are long gone, and the CLI has been replaced by famil-
iar mice, menus, and windows.
Although the command line is for the most part a dusty relic of the past (you 
can happily use your Linux Eee PC and never have to worry about entering 
text-based commands), it’s still available, and you actually have some com-
pelling reasons for knowing a little about it.
In this chapter, I gently introduce you to command-line Linux on the Eee PC. 
My goal is not to turn you into a keyboard Linux guru, but to explain the basics 
of using the command line just in case you want (or need) to put it to use.
Conquering the Console
To begin with you must know exactly where to enter Linux commands. You 
use a dedicated window called a console (it’s also known as shell or terminal).

304
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
You type commands in the console, ending each line by pressing the Enter 
key. The Eee PC then executes the commands. If the Eee PC doesn’t under-
stand the command (let’s say you made a typo), it displays an error message.
So why use the console when you have a perfectly good touchpad or mouse 
for clicking icons and menu commands? There are some good reasons for 
using the console, including
 
✓ It’s faster for navigating the file system and entering commands.
 
✓ It teaches you more about what’s going on behind the scenes.
 
✓ It offers a consistent way of entering commands when dealing with dif-
ferent Linux user interfaces.
 
✓ You can create and run shell scripts (the Linux version of a DOS or 
Windows batch file) to automate tasks.
 
✓ You can impress your friends, family, and coworkers with your 3l33t 
skillz (that translates out to elite computer skills for you non-hackers).
 
When you hear people talking about bash, it’s not necessarily what they 
want to do to their Eee PC when it misbehaves. Instead they’re referring to 
the Bourne Again Shell (BA Shell, get it?). Bash is the default shell on most 
Linux distributions. It interprets and processes console commands. Bourne is 
Stephen Bourne who wrote the original Unix shell, which was called sh.
Let the Console Session Begin
The version of Linux installed on the Eee PC does a pretty good job of hiding 
the console from you. You won’t find a console, terminal, or shell icon in 
any of the desktop tabs. This makes sense, in a way, because the Eee PC 
is designed to be a simple computing appliance — ASUS limits the ways a 
novice Linux user can possibly get into trouble.
That said, two versions of consoles are available on the Eee PC (both are 
preinstalled). Here’s a little about each, as well as how to start them. 
Consolation prize: xterm
When you press Ctrl+Alt+T, a console window is displayed as in Figure 20-1. 
This is a version of console named xterm (the underlying windows system for 
Linux is called X Windows, thus xterm, as in terminal).
 
You don’t need to be at the desktop to open an xterm window. You can be in 
most any program, and Crtl+Alt+T will pop up a console session.

305
 Chapter 20: Command-Line Linux
 
Figure 20-1: 
The xterm 
console.
 
 
Each time you press Ctrl+Alt+T a new console window opens. You can have 
multiple consoles open at once.
xterm is a very basic console, and Linux novices may find several limitations 
in using it, including
 
✓ Small text size
 
✓ Fixed text and background colors
 
✓ Difficulty in copying and pasting between programs
 
Although it’s possible to change xterm settings, it’s not straightforward for a 
Linux newbie. To learn more about xterm settings and options, visit its manual 
page at www.xfree86.org/4.0.1/xterm.1.html.
After the xterm window is displayed, you can start entering commands. If you 
want to try out a simple console command now, type ls and then press the 
Enter key. The contents of the current directory are shown, and the console 
waits for the next command. (I describe more commands coming up.)
To close an xterm console window, you have two choices:
 
✓ Click the window close box (the red square with the white X in the 
upper right corner).
 
✓ Type exit in the console.

Komputing with Konsole
The other console available in Linux Eee PCs is called Konsole. Konsole 
is KDE’s default console (it’s shown in Figure 20-2). Compared to xterm, 
Konsole looks more like a real program. It has menus, dialog boxes, and
windows. It’s more user-friendly and has many features, including
 
✓ Bookmarking for frequently used commands
 
✓ Easy copying and pasting between programs
 
✓ Variable text size and fonts
 
✓ Vertical scrolling for when more than one screen of information is 
displayed
 
✓ History with searching for previously entered commands
 
Figure 20-2: 
The Konsole 
console.
 
 
Konsole also has a number of advanced features. To learn about them, select 
Konsole Handbook in the Help menu. Or visit the program’s home page at: 
http://konsole.kde.org/.
There are two ways to run Konsole. The first is to use the xterm console. (I 
know, using a console to run another console sounds a bit silly.)
 
1. Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a console.
 
2. Type konsole.

307
 Chapter 20: Command-Line Linux
The other method is to run Konsole from within the File Manager.
 
1. In the desktop Work tab, click File Manager.
 
2. In the Tools menu, select Open Console Window.
The Konsole window appears, and you can start entering commands.
When you’re done with Konsole, in the Session menu, select Quit.
Which console to choose?
Choosing a console is a lot like choosing a flavor of ice cream. There is no 
right answer, so try out both consoles to see which works best for you.
If I want to enter some quick commands, I use xterm. It’s fast and gets the 
job done.
If I’m going to be using console for awhile, I switch to Konsole. It’s easier on 
the eyes, copying and pasting is simpler, and I have quick menu access to 
advanced features.
 
You can change a setting with the TweakEEE utility that changes Konsole to 
the default console when you press Ctrl+Alt+T. I describe how to do this in 
Chapter 21.
Console Concepts
Now you know about the consoles you can use with the Eee PC. But before 
I show you some basic Linux commands, I want to briefly cover a few 
fundamental console concepts.
The first and most important thing to remember is that when it comes to 
commands, Linux is case-sensitive. If you type Konsole to run the program, 
you get an error message. If you type konsole, the program runs. Pay 
attention to capitalization or lack thereof.
The second point is that many Linux commands are simply programs. If you 
start nosing around in directories with the console, you find these programs 
in the /bin directory. If you know the name of a program, you can run it by 
entering its name while using the console.
 
When you type a command in the console, press the Enter key to run the com-
mand. When I talk about commands in this chapter, assume Enter is pressed 
unless I tell you otherwise.

308
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
 
If you don’t know what you’re doing at the console, you can really mess up 
your system. Although the Linux Eee PC is incredibly easy to restore if you 
make a bad boo-boo at the console, I encourage you to take the time to 
understand what commands mean before you blindly start typing, copying, or 
pasting commands shown on Web sites or forums.
Command help
Even though console is text-based, it does have a fair amount of online help 
available. If you want to learn more about a Linux command when you’re 
using the console, use a command named man.
man is short for manual — as in the user guide variety. Enter man (followed 
by a space) and the command you want help with. For example, to find out 
about the pwd command (which displays the name of the directory you’re 
currently in), type: man pwd.
After help is displayed, several keyboard commands enable you to view and 
navigate through the manual information. Here are some of most common 
keyboard commands:
 
✓ Space or PgDn shows the next screen of text.
 
✓ PgUp shows the previous screen of text.
 
✓ Up- and down-arrow keys moves up or down a line at a time.
 
✓ Q exits the manual.
 
Information displayed with man tends to be terse and sometimes not the 
easiest to understand. If something doesn’t make sense, head to Google. 
Many Web sites provide in-depth and easy-to-understand explanations of 
Linux commands including examples.
Arguments
If you use the console long enough, at some point you will enter a command 
and things won’t work out as you expected. You’re certain that you’re right 
and the computer is wrong. But that’s not the type of argument I’m talking 
about here.
Many commands have arguments (sometimes called switches). This is an 
optional bit of text added to a command that changes its behavior. Typically, 
arguments are distinguished with a hyphen.

309
 Chapter 20: Command-Line Linux
Here are some simple arguments you can try:
 
✓ ls shows the contents of a directory.
 
✓ ls -a shows the contents of a directory, including invisible files and 
directories.
 
✓ ls -l shows the contents of a directory in long listing format, including 
filenames, creation dates and permissions.
Use man, which I discussed in the previous section, to see what arguments 
are available for a selected command.
Sudo
Computer geeks tend to like science fiction, but sudo has nothing to do with 
Mr. Sulu from Star Trek. Instead, sudo is an acronym for Super User Do. 
Here’s what this command is all about.
In order to run some Linux commands and programs, you must have admin-
istrative privileges. These commands and programs relate to activities such 
as changing the operating system or how it runs — typically tasks that only a 
system administrator can perform.
When you start a console session, it’s running in a nonprivileged state, so 
to execute certain commands you need to type sudo (followed by a space) 
before you enter the command. This gives you the privileges you need to 
execute a command or run a program.
For example if you want to run File Manager in a privileged state (let’s say 
you want to customize the user interface, as I describe in Chapter 21, and add 
your own icons to a system directory), at the console you enter
sudo XandrosFileManager
 
When it comes to sudo, “with great power, comes great responsibility.” With 
administrative privileges you can modify and delete system files you normally 
couldn’t. Be careful out there! Sudo should not be used for everything.
 
In other Linux distributions, you supply an administrator password with sudo. 
This is not the case with Xandros and the Eee PC. Some people believe this is 
a bit of a security flaw.

310
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
Directories and files
You can use the cd and ls commands at the console to connect to directories 
and list their contents. In addition to File Manager, two undocumented programs 
also enable you to view everything on your drive.
Konqueror
Konqueror is the default KDE file manager (as shown in Figure 20-3). Its 
menus, icons, and windows are intuitive and easy to use (online help is 
available), and it offers full access to the Eee PC file system.
 
Figure 20-3: 
Konqueror, 
the default 
file 
manager.
 
To run Konqueror, at the console type konqueror.
Midnight Commander
Midnight Commander is a Linux, text-based file manager that you can use 
to view files and directories on your Eee PC (all well as copy, delete, and 
rename files, and do other things, too). Use the cursor to run commands and 
move through the directory structure. Midnight Commander is shown in 
Figure 20-4.
To run Midnight Commander, at the console type mc.
 
If you’re new to Linux, please only use Konqueror and Midnight Commander 
for exploring. Avoid the copy, delete, rename, and other power commands 
that might get you in trouble if you don’t know what you’re doing.

311
 Chapter 20: Command-Line Linux
 
Figure 20-4: 
Midnight 
Commander.
 
 
Wondering what all those /bin, /etc, /sbin, and /usr directories are? Here’s a 
link that explains and describes Linux’s directory structure: www.tuxfiles.
org/linuxhelp/linuxdir.html.
Redirecting and piping
Many Linux commands send their outputs to the screen. If you want to save 
the contents of command output to a file, you can redirect the output, using 
the > character.
For example, to save the contents of a directory listing to the file 
mydirectory.txt, you enter
ls > mydirectory.txt
 
Two > characters (>>) append command output to a file. For example 
ls >> mydirectory.txt adds the directory listing to existing data in the 
text file, whereas a single > overwrites the file with new data.
The pipe command also redirects output, but to other commands or pro-
grams instead of files. The | character (Shift+\) pipes the output of a com-
mand to another command.
For example if you use the ls command to view the contents of a large 
directory, and the files fly off the screen before you can see them, you can 
use piping like this;

312
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
ls | less
This redirects the directory listing output to a program named less. Less 
is normally used to view text files, but can also process text output from 
commands. You can now leisurely browse through the directory listing, 
using less to display a screen full of files at a time.
Keyboard shortcuts
The console (specifically, the bash shell) has a number of keyboard shortcuts 
to make life easier when you’re using it. Here are a few useful shortcuts to 
know:
 
✓ Ctrl+A — Goes to the beginning of the line you’re typing.
 
✓ Ctrl+C — Cancels the command that is currently running.
 
✓ Ctrl+E — Goes to the end of the line you’re typing.
 
✓ Ctrl+K — Clears all text after the cursor.
 
✓ Tab — Auto-completes a command, file or directory name.
 
✓ Up- and down-arrow keys — The bash shell keeps a history of previ-
ously entered commands; the arrow keys scroll through them.
 
✓ Right- and left-arrow keys — If you’re typing a command and notice 
a typo, use the right- or left-arrow keys to move the cursor to the 
character after the mistake. Fix the typo by using Backspace and enter-
ing the correct text.
 
Here is a link to a complete list of bash shell keyboard shortcuts: www.
bigsmoke.us/readline/shortcuts.
More on command-line Linux
There’s much more to using command-line 
Linux than I have the pages to describe. Here 
are some excellent, online learning resources:
 ✓ http://linuxcommand.org/ — A 
great tutorial and reference site
 ✓ www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/
cli.html — Linux command line tutori-
als for newbies
 ✓ www.freeos.com/guides/lsst/ — 
Linux shell scripting tutorials
The Eee PC is a perfect computer for experi-
menting with and learning Linux. Don’t be 
intimidated by command line Linux. It’s not that 
difficult to master if you spend a little time with 
it. The return is definitely worth the investment.

Customizing the User Interface
In This Chapter
▶ Learning about simpleui.rc
▶ Editing tabs and icons with Launcher Tools
▶ Modifying IceWM preferences
▶ Tweaking the interface with TweakEEE
▶ Changing desktop themes with Theeemer
▶ Other customization tools
I
n Chapter 9 and the section about personalizing your Linux Eee PC, you 
see that aside from being able to change the background color, you can’t 
do much else to customize the Eee PC’s desktop.
ASUS wanted to keep the Linux Eee PC simple and sweet, so it doesn’t pro-
vide a control panel for personalizing the mini-laptop. Or at least that’s how 
it appears on the surface. But I’ll let you in on a little secret.
You actually can add a touch of personality to the Easy Mode desktop inter-
face and even do a little tweaking to make it easier to use. It’s not that hard if 
you know a few simple tricks and employ some easy-to-use tools written by 
several Eee PC users.
In this chapter, I fill you in on what you need to know to modify the default 
Linux desktop interface. I show you how to add program icons and tabs, 
bring back icons that mysteriously disappeared, modify the taskbar, change 
backgrounds, and use different themes.
simpleui.rc Explained
First, some background to help you understand how the Eee PC works. The 
mini-laptop uses a file named simpleui.rc to store a number of Linux desktop 
settings. This text file contains information about the desktop tabs and which 
program and folder icons are found inside each of the tabs. A program named 
AsusLauncher uses the settings in simpleui.rc to create the Eee PC desktop.

316
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
By editing simpleui.rc, you can customize which programs appear in the 
tabs — changing their icons and even adding new tabs. (Remember, if 
changes to simpleui.rc make your Eee PC misbehave, you can always use an 
F9 restore that I describe in Chapter 18 to get back to normal.)
 
simpleui.rc can sometimes get corrupted when you add or update software — 
this is what causes program icons to disappear. You can restore vanished icons 
with the Launcher Tools programs that I discuss later in this chapter or keep a 
backup copy of simpleui.rc to replace a corrupted copy.
 
If you’re a techie and like to do everything by hand, check out this how-to 
on backing up and modifying simpleui.rc: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/
howto:backupsimpleui. Keep in mind that simpleui.rc may be installed in 
different locations depending on the Eee PC model. Do a search for simpleui.rc 
in the http://forum.eeeuser.com forums for more information.
You can back up simpleui.rc with console commands and edit the file with a 
text editor (the data elements in the file are called parcels). However several 
programs make the job much easier — even for Linux gurus. I tell you about 
them next.
Adding Icons and Tabs 
with Launcher Tools
If I want to modify the Easy Mode Linux desktop, the first place I turn is 
Launcher Tools. Launcher Tools is a collection of programs (shown in Figure 
21-1) that includes
 
✓ SimpleUI Editor — A graphical user interface tool for editing the sim-
pleui.rc file
 
✓ Iconifier — An application that creates desktop icons from graphics 
files
 
✓ Reload GUI — A program that reloads the desktop so you can view 
changes without restarting your Eee PC
 
✓ Uninstall — A utility that removes all the Launcher Tools if you don’t 
need them any more (a nice feature because of the limited drive space 
on many Eee PC models)

317
 Chapter 21: Customizing the User Interface
 
Figure 21-1: 
Launcher

Favorites 
tab.
 
To install a copy of Launcher Tools, follow these steps: 
 
1. With your Eee PC Web browser, go to www.3eportal.com.
 
 Click the Downloads button at the top of the page. Go to the Launcher 
Tools information link.
 
2. Download the latest version of altools (right-click the link and Save 
Link As).
 
 This saves a copy of altools (the Launcher Tools installation file) to your 
My Home directory.
 
3. With File Manager open, right-click the altools file, and select Install 
DEB File from the pop-up menu.
 
 The installation program runs. Follow the instructions.
A copy of Launcher Tools is now installed in the desktop tab you specified. 
Click the Launcher Tools icon to display the programs.
 
After installing, you can also run the SimpleUI Editor from Launcher Tools by 
typing suieditor at the command line. 
You can make many changes to the desktop using SimpleUI Editor, but here 
I want to focus on a few basic customization techniques. SimpleUI Editor is 
pretty simple to figure out, and you’ll be personalizing your desktop in no 
time.

318
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
Changing a program’s icon
If a program icon in a tab doesn’t suit you, you can easily change its appear-
ance with SimpleUI Editor. Run the program and then follow these steps:
 
1. Select the program icon you want to change, right-click, and choose 
Properties from the pop-up menu.
 
2. In the Icon drop-down list box, select an icon.
 
 A list of preinstalled icons is displayed.
 
3. Click Apply.
 
4. Click Save Changes at the top of the window.
 
 Whenever you save changes, SimpleUI Editor always makes a backup 
copy of simpleui.rc. In the Save Changes dialog box, the program tells 
you how to revert to the backup file.
 
5. Click Reload AsusLauncher at the top of the window.
A new program icon is associated with the program.
 
Desktop icons are saved in PNG format in the /opt/xandros/share/
AsusLauncher/ directory — you need administrator privileges to add files to 
this directory — on later Eee PC models the icons may appear in the /var/
lib/AsusLauncher/ directory. See Chapter 20 for more information. For a quick 
tutorial on creating your own icons, visit http://wiki.eeeuser.com/
customizeeasymodeicons. You can also use the Iconifier program that 
comes with Launcher Tools to create icons from existing PNG files.
Adding a program icon to a tab
If you just installed a program on your Eee PC and want it to appear in one of 
the desktop tabs, run SimpleUI Editor and follow along:
 
1. Right-click in the tab area (not on a program icon) and select New 
Program in the pop-up menu.
 
2. In the dialog box, select the tab you want the program added to.
 
3. Enter the program name you want to appear in the tab.
 
4. Select an icon to associate with the program.
 
 A number of preinstalled icons are available.
 
5. In the Command text box, enter the program’s path.

319
 Chapter 21: Customizing the User Interface
 
 If you don’t know the exact path, try entering the name of the program 
and press the Enter key. SimpleUI Editor searches directories where 
programs are commonly installed. If it finds a match, it uses that path. 
Remember, Linux is case-sensitive, so the program and path must be 
capitalized correctly.
 
6. Click Create.
 
7. Click Save Changes at the top of the window.
 
8. Click Reload AsusLauncher.
A new program icon is now available in the desktop. Click the icon to run the 
program.
 
You can also use the same steps to create folders within tabs. In Step 1, 
choose New Folder from the pop-up menu instead of New Program.
To delete a program or folder icon from a tab, run SimpleUI Editor, select the 
icon, right-click, and choose Delete from the pop-up menu.
Restoring a vanished icon
In the simpleui.rc file, each desktop icon has a link to a program that runs 
when you click the icon. If the link is blank or points to a program that 
doesn’t exist (often an incorrect path), the icon won’t be displayed in a tab.
This is a frequent culprit in the case of the vanishing icons. Link information 
accidentally gets changed when you run Add/Remove Software, and the icon 
disappears. To restore the icon, SimpleUI Editor is your friend. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select the tab containing the vanished icon.
 
2. Select the program icon that disappeared, right-click, and choose 
Properties from the pop-up menu.
 
 The Item Properties dialog box is displayed as shown in Figure 21-2.
 
3. In the Command text box, enter the full path of the program.
 
 If the path is blank or it says Invalid Command! underneath, there’s 
your problem! If you don’t know the program’s full path, type in the 
program’s name (for example, FBReader) and press Enter. This auto-
searches for a program with that name’s correct path. (Remember, 
Linux is case-sensitive, so use exact uppercase and lowercase spelling.) 
If Valid Command! appears under the path, you’re set.

 If you don’t know the name of a program, refer to the chapters 
in Part II of this book where I discuss each desktop tab and its 
respective program. Program names and paths for preinstalled 
programs can also be found here: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/
doc:icewmstartmenutemplates.
 
 You may notice icons for programs you’ve never seen before. These may 
have been added when you ran Add/Remove Software. You can delete 
any unused icons (which is good housekeeping) or leave them alone.
 
4. Click Apply.
 
5. Click Save Changes at the top of the window.
 
6. Click Reload AsusLauncher.
The program icon should now be restored to the desktop, and you can 
happily use it again.
Adding a new tab to the desktop
If you’re a little bored with the standard Internet, Work, Learn, Play, Settings, 
and Favorites tabs, why not add a tab of your own? It’s simple. Use the Tab 
Management menu in SimpleUI Editor.
 
1. Select New Tab from the menu.
 
2. Specify a JPG background file to use.

321
 Chapter 21: Customizing the User Interface
 
 Backgrounds are saved in JPG format and are stored in the /opt/xandros/
share/AsusLauncher/ directory (or /var/lib/AsusLauncher/ in some Eee PC 
models).
 
3. Give the tab a name.
 
4. Choose an icon for the tab.
 
5. Provide a Tab ID.
 
 It can be the same as the name — as long as the ID is unique.
 
6. Specify where you want the tab to appear.
 
 You can choose if it appears before one of the existing tabs or after the 
Favorites tab.
 
7. Click Create.
 
8. Click Save Changes at the top of the window.
 
9. Click Reload AsusLauncher.
You now can use SimpleUI Editor to add program icons to your newly 
created tab.
 
To change the properties of an existing tab, including the name and back-
ground image, select Properties Current Tab from the Tab Management menu. 
You can also delete tabs with this menu.
Chilling with IceWM
IceWM is a Linux window manager that’s popular on PCs that don’t have 
screaming fast processors and lots of memory — it doesn’t require many 
system resources. That’s one of the reasons it’s used by the AsusLauncher 
program to display the Eee PC’s desktop interface.
IceWM is very customizable. It uses a preferences file for storing informa-
tion about elements of the window manager desktop and how the elements 
appear. Like simpleui.rc, you can modify settings in this preferences file to 
change your Linux Eee PC’s default user interface.
You have two options. Modify the preferences file by hand (here’s a tutorial 
with some basics: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:icewmstartmenu); 
or if that’s a little intimidating, change settings with the TweakEEE and 
Theemer programs that I tell you about coming up next.

322
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
 
For everything you always wanted to know about IceWM but were afraid to 
ask, visit the project Web site at www.icewm.org and check out the IceWM 
user manual (www.icewm.org/manual/icewm-1.html).
Tweaking the Interface with TweakEEE
Launcher Tools is great for modifying the tabbed desktop, but if I want to 
make even more changes to the interface I use a nifty all-purpose utility 
called TweakEEE (as shown in Figure 21-3).
 
Figure 21-3: 
Customize 
the inter-
face with 
TweakEEE.
 
To install a copy of TweakEEE, follow these steps:
 
1. With your Eee PC Web browser, go to www.infinitedesigns.org/
archives/195.
 
2. Right-click the download link and Save Link As.
 
 This saves a copy of TweakEEE to your My Home directory.
 
3. With File Manager open, right-click the TweakEEE file, and select 
Install DEB File from the pop-up menu.
 
 The installation program runs. Follow the instructions.

323
 Chapter 21: Customizing the User Interface
A copy of TweakEEE is now installed in the desktop tab you specified. Click 
the TweakEEE icon to run the program.
 
In addition to modifying the interface, TweakEEE can also download and 
install a number of popular programs, back up interface-related files, change 
the default console, add extra repositories, and perform a number of other 
Swiss-army-knife–like tasks. Spend some time exploring the program to learn 
about all its features.
Showing the Start button
If you’re a Windows user, you’re certainly familiar with the Start button in 
the lower-left corner of the Windows taskbar. TweakEEE can add a similar 
button to the desktop interface, making it easier to navigate programs. Run 
TweakEEE and then
 
1. In the Appearance tab, check Show Start Menu and Menu Template.
 
2. Click Apply.
A Start button is added to the taskbar as shown in Figure 21-4. Use it to run 
installed programs.
 
Figure 21-4: 
Add a Start 
button to the 
desktop.

Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
Changing the taskbar clock format
By default, the clock in the taskbar displays the time only in a 24-hour format — 
with no apparent way to change it to the more familiar AM/PM format. At least 
not until you use TweakEEE.
Click the Appearance tab and then scroll to the bottom until you come to the 
Clock Format option. You have a choice of
 
✓ Time displayed in 24-hour format (13:00)
 
✓ Time displayed in AM/PM format (1:00 PM)
 
✓ Time and date displayed numerically (7/12/08 - 01:00 PM)
 
✓ Day of the month and time displayed (12 - 01:00 PM)
 
✓ Month, day and time displayed (July 12 - 01:00 PM)
Select a format and click Apply. The taskbar clock now reflects the new 
setting.
Removing taskbar icons
You may not use certain icons in the Linux desktop taskbar very often, and 
so they just take up space. These icons include the following:
 
✓ SOS — Runs the Task Manager. You can also run SOS from the 
Shutdown dialog.
 
✓ EEEPC Tips — Displays a brief list of Eee PC-related tips in the browser.
 
✓ Shutdown — Runs the Shutdown program. You can also run Shutdown 
by clicking Instant Shutdown in the Settings tab or pressing the power 
button.
 
✓ SCIM — Switches between Chinese and English as the input method.
 
✓ Num and Caps Lock — Shows whether the Caps Lock and NumLk keys 
are depressed.
To turn off these icons in the taskbar, click the TweakEEE Configuration tab, 
choose the icons you don’t want displayed, and click Apply. (You may need 
to click the taskbar to refresh it.)
To turn an icon back on, uncheck it and click Apply.

 Chapter 21: Customizing the User Interface
Custom Themes with Theeemer
Downloading themes (or skins) is a popular way to personalize a PC. A 
program, written by the author of Launcher Tools, lets you do just that with 
your Eee PC.
Theeemer (Th-Eee-mer, get it?), as shown in Figure 21-5, can modify a number 
of different IceWM settings to give you a custom user interface.
 
Figure 21-5: 
Use 
Theeemer 
to change 
desktop 
themes.
 
When you run the program, four tabs are displayed. Click a tab to see options 
for making changes to various user interface elements.
 
✓ Manage Themes — Select a theme from the drop-down list box (a pre-
view appears, showing you what the taskbar looks like using the theme). 
Replace the current theme with the selected one and click Apply. A 
sample theme is shown in Figure 21-6. To add additional themes (files 
with a .emt extension), use the Browse button and click Install Theme. 
That theme now appears in the drop-down list box.
 
 Notice that many themes don’t show a preview taskbar. That’s because 
these themes are more generically suited for Linux PCs. There aren’t 
many custom themes designed specifically for the Eee PC yet (the ones 
that are available show the preview taskbar). You can get several Eee PC 
themes on the Theeemer download page (www.3eportal.com). Look 
for more themes in the future and for programs that make it easier to 
create and save themes.

✓ Login Screen — This option lets you replace the default login screen 
at start-up with a JPG graphics file of your own. (There are convenient 
Restore and Default buttons, just in case.)
 
✓ Backgrounds — Similar to the Login Screen option, this selection is for 
replacing the background of a desktop tab with a JPG file of your choice.
 
✓ Launcher — With Launcher you can change individual elements of the 
taskbar. Move the cursor over an element to display pop-up information 
about the image name (a PNG file) and its dimensions. Right-click an 
element to change its color or replace the image with your own. (It’s 
quick and easy to go back to the default settings in case you’re not 
happy with your changes.)
As with other programs, the best way to learn about Theeemer is to spend 
some time experimenting. To install a copy of the program, follow these 
steps:
 
1. With your Eee PC Web browser, go to www.3eportal.com.
 
 Click the Downloads button at the top of the page. Go to the Theeemer 
program information link.
 
2. Download the latest version of Theeemer (right-click the link and 
choose Save Link As).
 
 This saves a copy of Theeemer to your My Home directory.
 
3. In File Manager, right-click the Theeemer file and select Install DEB 
File from the pop-up menu.
 
 The installation program runs. Follow the instructions.

327
 Chapter 21: Customizing the User Interface
A copy of Theeemer is now installed in the Settings tab. Click its icon to run 
the program.
 
If Theeemer didn’t appear to install or if nothing happens when you click the 
program icon, open a console session (by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter: 
theeemer. If you get an error message about no valid themes, enter this 
command at the console to copy themes into a required directory: cp -rf /usr/
share/icewm/themes ~/.icewm.

http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?id=15049.
Using Other Customization Tools
In addition to Launcher Tools, TweakEEE, and Theemer, you can use several 
other tools to customize your Eee PC’s user interface.
Pimpmyeee.sh
Pimpmyeee (pimp-my-eee) is a shell script for customizing your Eee PC. You 
can download it with your Web browser by visiting http://code.google.
com/p/pimpmyeee/ (right-click the file link and choose Save link as).
With the script, you can do the following:
 
✓ Enable Advanced Mode desktop.
 
✓ Disable SCIM input and remove its taskbar icon.
 
✓ Install several themes.
 
✓ Remove SOS and Eee PC Tips from taskbar.
 
✓ Enable extra repositories.
 
✓ Enable all codecs.
After you’ve downloaded Pimpmyee.sh, follow these steps to run the utility:
 
1. Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a console session.
 
2. Enter sh pimpmyeee-1.0.2.sh.
 
 Or depending on the version, whatever the correct filename is. You’re 
greeted with several options. (You need an Internet connection for some 
of the choices).
 
3. Select the interface option you want to change.

328
Part V: Eee PC Advanced Topics 
 
4. Press Enter to return to the shell script and then press Q to quit.
There’s also an Unpimpmyee.sh utility to revert some of the changed options 
to original form.
 
Shell scripts are just text files. You can open them with a word processor to 
see the commands that are being executed. Anytime you work with a shell 
script you should do this.
Easy Mode Editor
Easy Mode Editor (also known as EM Editor) is another program for modifying 
simpleui.rc. It has a different interface than SimpleUI Editor, but shares many of 
the same features. To download the program and learn more about it (including 
seeing some screen shots of the utility), visit http://download.
projectsakura.com/eeepc/emeditor.html.
 
In this chapter, I focus on how to modify the Easy Mode desktop. However, if 
you’re using Advanced Mode (the full desktop), you don’t need to hand modify 
preferences files or use third-party programs to personalize your Eee PC. Many 
customization options are available in the KDE Control Center. I tell you how to 
install Advanced Mode and access the Control Center in Chapter 19.

Part VI
Part of Tens

In this part . . .
A
ll Dummies books have a part called The Part of 
Tens, and this one is no exception. This is a rather 
eclectic collection of Eee PC–related information. You find 
a chapter devoted to troubleshooting common Eee PC 
problems and another one that presents essential Internet 
information sources.

Chapter 22
Ten Eee PC Troubleshooting Tips
In This Chapter
▶ Disappearing icons
▶ Unresponsive (or too responsive) touchpads
▶ Wacky Web cams
▶ Shutdown when closed, instead of suspend
▶ Forgotten passwords
▶ Wireless connection problems
▶ Freezes and hangs
▶ Unwritable SD cards and USB thumb drives
▶ Mystery ailments
▶ Dead as a doornail Eee PCs
T
he Eee PC is a reliable little computer, but every now and then gremlins 
can creep in and cause some trouble.
In this chapter, I list ten Eee PC ailments you may run into some day. 
For each problem, I describe the symptom and then provide one or two 
possible solutions. (Some of the solutions involve using the Linux console 
and entering text commands, but I walk you gently through the process.)
 
It’s always convenient (and sometimes justified) to blame the Eee PC, its 
operating system, or a program for a problem you’re encountering. Before you 
do this though, take a minute to ensure it’s not a PEBKAC situation — that’s 
Problem Exists between Keyboard and Chair.
My Icon(s) Disappeared!
Symptom: You used the Add/Remove Software program to update your Linux 
Eee PC, and now one or more icons have gone missing from the desktop.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Solution: Elementary, Watson. The simpleui.rc (which contains information 
about desktop icons) has gotten corrupted. If you’ve backed up this file, as I 
discuss in Chapter 21, simply replace the corrupted file with your backup.
You can also use an icon utility such as SimpleUI Editor (part of Launcher 
Tools) or Easy Mode Editor to bring the icon(s) back. I tell you all about 
these tools and how to use them in Chapter 21.
The last resort solution is to perform an F9 recovery. This restores your 
Linux Eee PC to how it came from the factory. The one gotcha with this tech-
nique is that any data you’ve saved on the Eee PC’s drive (including new pro-
grams, files, and operating system settings) are deleted. Be sure to back up 
your files onto an SD card or USB thumb drive. I tell you all about performing 
an F9 restore in Chapter 18.
My Touchpad Has Problems Scrolling
Symptom: When you use the touchpad you need to exert a lot of pressure to 
move the cursor, or you barely brush the touchpad and the cursor goes flying.
Solution: Touchpads work by using sensors to measure the electrical charge 
in your finger. Your touchpad can be working fine, but suddenly starts mis-
behaving because something changes the way the electrical charge (known 
as capacitance) is measured. This could be increased heat, humidity, or even 
sweat on your skin. To remedy the problem, change the sensitivity settings 
to make the touchpad more or less sensitive. With Linux, use the Touchpad 
program in the Settings tab; with Windows, go to the Control Panel and 
change the Elantech touchpad properties.
 
If you run Windows XP and continue to have problems with the touchpad, 
try installing the latest touchpad driver from the ASUS support Web site 
(http://support.asus.com).
My Web Cam Doesn’t Work
Symptom: You try to use your Web cam, but it doesn’t work.
Solution: First, determine if this is a hardware or software problem. Is it just 
one particular program that won’t work with the Web cam or all programs? 
For example, the version of Skype that originally shipped with Linux Eee PC 
4G may need to be upgraded to a later version to work with the Web cam.
 
In Windows, make sure the Web cam is enabled in the Eee PC tray utility.

333
 Chapter 22: Ten Eee PC Troubleshooting Tips
 
If you installed your own copy of Windows XP and used nLite or a similar 
utility to shrink the size, be sure you didn’t remove the Windows Image 
Acquisition (WIA) module. The Web cam needs these files to function.
If the Web cam doesn’t work with any programs, there’s a chance it somehow 
has become disabled in the BIOS settings. Here’s how to re-enable it:
 
1. Turn on or reboot your Eee PC.
 
2. At the start-up screen, press F2 to enter the BIOS setup.
 
3. Use the right-arrow key to go to the Advanced tab.
 
4. Use the down-arrow key, select Onboard Devices Configuration. Then 
press Enter.
 
5. With the down-arrow key, select Onboard Camera. Make sure it is 
marked Enabled.
 
 If it’s not, press Enter, select Enabled from the menu, and press Enter 
again.
 
6. Press Esc to return to the Advanced tab.
 
7. Use the down-arrow key to select OS Installation. Make sure it’s 
marked Finished.
 
 If it’s not, press Enter, select Finished from the menu, and press Enter 
again.
 
8. Press F10 to save your changes and exit.
The Eee PC reboots, and your camera should now be working.
 
Speaking of Web cams, I need to make a pitch for a cool little open-source 
program called Dorgem (http://dorgem.sourceforge.net/). Dorgem 
turns your Windows Eee PC’s Web cam into a stealthy security monitor with 
motion detection code that snaps a photo when the camera detects move-
ment. This is the perfect tool for spying on your cats when you’re not home.
My Eee PC Suspends When 
I Close the Lid
Symptom: You close the lid on your Linux Eee PC, go off to do something, 
and when you come back, the battery has drained.
Solution: By default, when you close your Linux Eee PC’s lid, it goes into a 
Suspend state. A reduced amount of power is still being used during suspend, 
and the battery can fully drain — depending how much of a charge it has and 
how long you leave it sitting.

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
There is a way to have your Linux Eee PC shut down instead of suspending 
when you close the lid. (Sorry, there’s no way to do this with Windows; you 
can only change settings to have the Eee PC suspend or do nothing when you 
close the lid.) To shut down instead of suspend, you modify a shell script. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Open a console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. Enter sudo kwrite /etc/acpi/lidbtn.sh.
 
 This loads the shell file you need to change.
 
3. In the file, look for the following lines:
      if [ $LID_STATE = “closed” ] ; then
        /etc/acpi/suspend2ram.sh
 
4. Change the lines to read:
      if [ $LID_STATE = “closed” ] ; then
        # /etc/acpi/suspend2ram.sh
        /sbin/fastshutdown.sh
 
 The # in front of the line turns it into a comment so the command isn’t 
executed. The added line that follows is an instruction to run a shell 
script that shuts down the Eee PC.
 
5. Save the file and quit the word processor.
Your Eee PC should now shut down when you close the lid. Give it a try.
 
For other ways to control a Linux Eee PC’s behavior when the lid closes, check 
out this how-to: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/close_lid_shutdown.
I Forgot My Password
Symptom: You forgot your password and now can’t log in to your Eee PC. Ouch!
Solution: First, make sure Caps Lock isn’t on when you log in, then read on.
Windows
If you’re running Windows XP and forget your password, you can log in to 
a PC in several ways. Check this handy how-to for one simple method that 
involves booting into Safe Mode as Administrator: www.wikihow.com
/Log-on-to-Windows-XP-if-You-Forget-Your-Password.
After you’re logged in, change your account password to something more 
memorable (and consider writing it down in case there’s a future memory 
lapse).

335
 Chapter 22: Ten Eee PC Troubleshooting Tips
Linux
If your Eee PC is running the default version of Linux, ASUS officially says 
you’re out of luck if you forget your password — you must do an F9 system 
restore (which will erase all your files).
However, what ASUS doesn’t tell you is that you have two sneaky ways to 
access a password-protected Eee PC without losing all your data. If you 
promise to use these methods only for good, and not evil, I’ll share them 
with you.
 
✓ Boot from another version of Linux — Most computer users don’t realize 
that if someone has physical access to a PC he or she can easily bypass 
an operating system start-up password — this holds true for both Linux 
and Windows. Instead of booting from the internal drive (which prompts 
you for a password), boot from a different operating system on a CD/DVD, 
USB thumb drive, or SD card. Presto! You’ve got access to the contents 
of the hard drive and can copy files or reset the password (to learn more 
about this, Google for Linux root password reset). If you want to try this 
approach, I tell you all about using other versions of Linux with the Eee 
PC in Bonus Chapter 1 on the companion Web site.
 
✓ Use console commands — Using another operating system to breech 
a PC’s security, is a tried-and-true technique. But there’s a faster and 
easier method to get around the password prompt. You can use an 
undocumented method to put your Eee PC into a special console mode 
at start-up. In this mode, you can enter certain commands to bypass the 
password prompt and then reset your password.
Here’s how to use the console commands:
 
1. Immediately press and hold F9 when you see the start-up screen.
 
 This displays boot loader options (the program running is called Grub, 
by the way).
 
2. Press the e key to select the Normal Boot option.
 
 This displays different boot commands.
 
3. Use the arrow key to select the line that starts with kernel and press 
the e key.
 
 You can now edit the boot command line.
 
4. At the end of the line, type a space, then XANDROSBOOTDEBUG=y.
 
 This puts the Eee PC in debug mode when you reboot.
 
5. Press Enter.
 
 You’re back at the main boot loader screen. Make sure the line starting 
with kernel is selected.

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
6. Press the b key.
 
 The boot command executes, and the BusyBox command prompt 
appears.
 
 BusyBox is a small program that provides versions of several essential 
Linux commands. It’s known as the Swiss army knife of embedded Linux 
and is found in a number of Linux hardware devices.
 
7. Enter the following commands:
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt-user/
cd /mnt-user/home/user/
rm .AsusLauncher/requireLogin
exit
These commands mount the Eee PC’s drive and delete a configuration file 
responsible for requesting a password at start-up. The mini-laptop reboots 
and no longer asks you for a password.
With the start-up password bypassed, you’re halfway there. You still need 
to deal with that pesky password you forgot (the Personalization program in 
the Settings tab won’t let you change your password unless you know the old 
one). Here’s how to do a password reset from the command line:
 
1. Open a console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. Enter sudo passwd user.
 
 This changes the user password. Type in a new password (write it down 
this time) and press Enter. If you’re prompted to enter the password a 
second time, do it.
 
3. Enter sudo passwd.
 
 This changes the root password. Use the same password that you just 
entered.
 
4. Close the console window.
Whew, that was kind of a pain. But if everything went okay, you’re back in 
business with a new password and all your files intact.
 
Although this procedure is as smooth as silk on an Eee PC 4G, I can’t guaran-
tee it works on other Eee PC models. (There’s always a possibility ASUS could 
change the location of the password prompt configuration file.) You can learn 
a little more about using the BusyBox console and the Eee PC here: http://
wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:installrescuemode.

337
 Chapter 22: Ten Eee PC Troubleshooting Tips
 
If you set a BIOS password and forgot it, you have two options. Open the Eee 
PC case (your mini-laptop should be powered off, not connected to power) 
and remove the BIOS battery — it’s similar to the type used in watches and 
calculators. This clears BIOS settings. Wait a few minutes, reinstall the battery, 
put your Eee PC back together, and power on. The other option is to install a 
new version of the BIOS as I discuss in Chapter 12.
My Wireless Connections Aren’t Working
Symptom: Your Eee PC’s wireless connection unexpectedly stops working, 
won’t reconnect, or you’ve never been able to get a connection.
Solution: Wireless problems can be both tricky and mysterious to resolve (I 
once had networking troubles that I swear were related to the phase of the 
moon). Usually the culprit is a setting that was inadvertently changed or a 
temporary glitch in the wireless card, router, or either’s interface software. 
You can try a number of things if you run into wireless difficulties. Check out 
the following:
 
✓ Is wireless enabled on your Eee PC? Is the blue light on? If it’s not, 
wireless is disabled. Press Fn+F2 to enable your wireless and wait for a 
connection.
 
✓ Is your wireless router/access point to blame? If you have another 
laptop, can you successfully get a Net connection? If not, reboot or turn 
the router off and on again. Wait about a minute until it reconnects to 
the Internet and then try connecting again with your Eee PC. (Typically, 
I’ll power my Eee PC off and then restart it after the wireless router’s 
status lights indicate there’s a connection.)
 
 Check which version of firmware the wireless router is running. If it’s not 
the most recent, upgrade to the latest version. Check your user manual 
or the manufacturer Web site for details.
 
✓ Does your router have any security settings (such as MAC address filter-
ing, WEP or WPA) that may be preventing the Eee PC from connecting? 
Some Linux Eee PC’s have difficulty connecting to a wireless router 
using WPA encryption when the required password contains a space — 
use a different password.
 
✓ Are you having troubles connecting to just one access point? Try con-
necting to a free public WiFi network (at a library, coffee shop, or col-
lege). If you’re successful, delete the problem connection and create a 
new connection (I tell you how to do this in Chapter 3). There’s a chance 
something in the settings got corrupted.

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Some Linux users have reported that upgrading to the 1.05 desktop with Add/
Remove Software resolved their wireless issues. I discuss upgrading your Eee 
PC in Chapter 12. 
My Eee PC Hangs at Shutdown
Symptom: You shut down your Eee PC, but it stays on. The shutdown screen 
may stay displayed or the screen goes black.
Solution: Press and hold the power button until the Eee PC turns off. The 
operating system got a little confused about something during the shutdown 
process and is stuck in a loop. Restart your mini-laptop and see if it shuts 
down normally.
If shutdown woes continue, try upgrading to the latest version of the BIOS as 
I describe in Chapter 12.
I Can’t Write to an SD Card 
or a USB Drive
Symptom: On a Linux Eee PC, you can’t save, move, or delete files on an SD 
card or a USB thumb drive. Your mini-laptop displays cryptic messages and 
won’t let you write to the card or drive.
Solution: First, check that the write protect tab isn’t switched on (all SD 
cards have this as well as some USB thumb drives). If the write protect tab is 
flipped on, switch it to the other position and you’re in business.
If that doesn’t do the trick, there’s a good chance the volume permissions are 
set to read-only, so any write operations to the device are being denied. The 
first thing to try is
 
1. Start a console session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. Enter sudo XandrosFileManager.
This runs File Manager with administrative privileges. Try copying, moving, 
or deleting files you previously had trouble with it. If you’re successful, great!

339
 Chapter 22: Ten Eee PC Troubleshooting Tips
You don’t want to be using File Manager with administrative privileges all the 
time, however, so make some changes to a configuration file that has permis-
sions settings. Here’s how:
  
1. Open a console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 
2. Enter sudo kwrite /etc/udev/rules.d/50-xandros-udev.rules.
 
 This loads the configuration file you need to change.
 
3. In the file, find this line:
 
BUS==”usb”, KERNEL==”sd[!0-9]”, NAME=”%k”, 
MODE=”0660”, GROUP=”floppy”, SYMLINK+=”disks/
Removable/%k”, RUN+=”/usr/bin/usbstorageapplet 
zip %k”
 
4. Change MODE from “0660” to “0666”.
 
 This sets permission for all users to read and write to the device. Change 
MODE to “0777” to allow read, write, and execute (run programs).
 
5. Save the file.
 
6. In the console enter sudo /sbin/udevstart.
 
 This last step reloads the changed configuration file. You should now be 
able to write files to your SD card or thumb drive.
My Eee PC Isn’t Working Right
Symptom: Your Eee PC just isn’t working correctly and seems to be suffering 
from some mystery ailment. 
Solution: The first question to ask is always: “What did I do right before my 
Eee PC started misbehaving?” Did I install a new program, upgrade to a later 
version, or make a change to the operating system? Nine times out of ten the 
answer provides an important clue.
With Linux, the default Easy Mode is pretty stable. When you start using 
Advanced Desktop, make undocumented changes to the operating system, or 
enter commands at the console (especially if you don’t fully understand what 
you’re doing), you risk making your system unstable. The solution is to per-
form an F9 restore (which I describe in depth in Chapter 18). If that doesn’t 
work, do a full reinstallation of the operating system with the recovery DVD.
Windows is a little more forgiving when it comes to making system changes 
(unfortunately, however, there’s no F9 system restore). The first thing to try 

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
is reinstalling any Eee PC drivers for the devices (touchpad, Web cam, or 
keyboard) that may be giving you problems. The drivers are on the DVD that 
came with the mini-laptop, or you can visit the http://support.asus.com 
Web site to get the latest versions.
If you used nLite or a similar program to try to reduce the size of Windows 
XP to save drive space, make sure you didn’t delete something that was 
required. (I talk nLite and shrinking Windows in Chapter 11.)
If you’re still having problems, the last resort is to perform a complete 
system reinstallation.
 
Whether you’re running Linux or Windows, you did back up any important 
files before doing a system restore, didn’t you?
My Eee PC Is Dead
Symptom: I saved the worst case scenario for last. You turn on the power 
and nothing happens. Or maybe the green power and blue wireless LED 
status lights come on, but the screen is black. Your Eee PC seems to be, to 
quote an old Monty Python skit, “pushin’ up the daisies.”
Solution: Don’t panic (panicking really never gets you anywhere, anyway).
First, try plugging the Eee PC into an electrical outlet. There’s a chance the 
battery has completely discharged, and there’s no power left.
If that doesn’t work, with the mini-laptop still plugged into the wall charger, 
read Chapter 18 for instructions on restoring your system with the DVD that 
comes with the Eee PC.
No luck with that? It sounds like it’s probably a hardware or BIOS problem. 
If it’s a failed motherboard or power supply, there’s not much you can do 
(unless you’re handy with a soldering iron and know your way around the 
insides of a PC, in which case you probably don’t need this chapter for 
advice).
If the BIOS has somehow become corrupted (say you tried to upgrade it, but 
something happened), you’ve got a last-resort option. Check out your user 
manual or this Wiki entry for information on installing a new copy of the 
BIOS: http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:updatebios.
Failing that, cross your fingers that your mini-computer is still under 
warranty and contact ASUS (defective Eee PCs are replaced rather than 
repaired).

Chapter 23
Top Ten Eee PC Internet Resources
In This Chapter
▶ ASUS - supported Web sites
▶ EeeUser Wiki and Forums
▶ Best of the blogs
T
raditional paper and ink books like this one are handy references — 
especially because they don’t require electricity and are pretty easy to 
tote around just about anywhere. However, a tremendous amount of informa-
tion and shared collective knowledge can be found on the Internet.
In this chapter, I list and describe what I consider to be the top ten (well, 
maybe more than that, but who’s counting) Internet resources for the Eee 
PCs. Here you find official and unofficial support and download sites, blogs 
devoted to the Eee PC, and other indispensable links.
The Official Word
Let’s start with two Web sites hosted by ASUS. Drum roll please!
 
✓ Eee PC (http://eeepc.asus.com/) — This is ASUS’s official Eee 
PC Web site. You find product information, news, and announcements 
related to the mini-laptop. It’s a bit sparse and some of the unofficial 
Web sites provide more and better information, but it’s still a good place 
to visit.
 
✓ ASUS Support (http://support.asus.com) — This is the general 
support site for all ASUS products. Here you can access official FAQs, 
download updates and utilities, and contact support staff.
 
Because ASUS is an international company, it has a presence in many countries. 
I’ve found Eee PC information (including downloads) can vary between ASUS 
country Web sites. If you feel like doing a little globe-trotting and exploring, 
check out ASUS’s main site at www.asus.com and then click a country link.

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
A lesser publicized ASUS resource, but incredibly useful if you know what 
you’re looking for (such as Windows drivers, user manuals for different 
models, and other utilities) is the company’s FTP site at:
ftp://ftp.asus.com/pub/ASUS/EeePC/
Directories are organized by model, and you can click a folder to view 
available files. The descriptions are nonexistent to minimal, so this site is 
more for the advanced user with some technical savvy. To download a file, 
move the cursor over the name, right-click, and use your browser’s Save Link 
As pop-up menu command.
Answers to Just About Any Question
If I have a question I need answered or want to keep up-to-date with what’s 
happening in the technical part of the Eee PC world, the first place I turn to 
(even before the ASUS sites) is the EeeUser community at www.eeeuser.com.
Put together by an Eee PC enthusiast who goes by the name of Ant, this is 
the most widely used and read Web site devoted to ASUS’ wee wonder. The 
site made its debut months before the Eee PC was publicly available and 
has turned into the definitive online Eee PC information resource — ASUS 
customer support is even known to steer users to the site.
Pay special attention to two parts of the EeeUser community:
 
✓ EeeUser Forums (http://forum.eeeuser.com/) — An extensive 
series of forums, organized by subject, where you can post questions 
and get answers from experienced Eee PC users from all over the world. 
There’s quite a bit of information-sharing that goes on in the forums, so 
don’t be shy about registering for a free account and participating. (Or if 
you’re shy, just sit back, lurk, and soak up lots of Eee PC knowledge.)
 
 Most forum members are friendly and helpful, but they ask you to do 
two things before posting a question. First, use the Search command 
at the top of the window and see if your question has already been 
discussed. Second, visit the Wiki. What Wiki you say? The one I talk 
about next.
 
✓ EeeUser Wiki (http://wiki.eeeuser.com/) — If you’re not familiar 
with the concept of a wiki, it’s a Web page where anyone can contribute 
knowledge and information. The EeeUser Wiki is devoted to sharing tips, 
tricks, and techniques related to the Eee PC. It offers a large number of 
how-tos and tutorials, ranging from novice guides to technical instruc-
tions for experienced Linux users. The Wiki is indexed and searchable. I 
highly recommend this resource because it covers a variety of advanced 
topics that I don’t have room to discuss in this book.

343
 Chapter 23: Top Ten Eee PC Internet Resources
 
In addition to the EeeUser forums, two other forum sites exist that, while they 
don’t quite get the large volume of traffic, still have good information. You can 
find them at www.eeeplace.com and www.eeeasy.com.
Best of the Blogs
If you want to stay up-to-date on all the latest news about Eee PCs (including 
new product releases, reviews, rumors, and general gossip), a number of 
blogs are devoted to your favorite mini-laptop. In alphabetical order, my top 
blog picks include
 
✓ All About Eee PC (www.allabouteeepc.com) — This blog started 
in February 2008, and so far is one of my top picks — mostly because 
it’s frequently updated and, in addition to news and views, contains a 
number of how-to articles.
 
✓ ASUS EEE Hacks (http://asuseeehacks.blogspot.com) — Another 
one of my favorite daily reads, with fresh news and useful information.
 
✓ Blogeee (www.blogeee.net) — This is an Eee PC blog from France 
that has posted a number of exclusive news stories including yet to be 
released, upcoming Eee PC models. Because I’ve forgotten most of my 
high school French, I use Google’s translation service at: www.google.
com/translate_t to see what the Web site has to say.
 
✓ Eee Guides (www.eeeguides.com) — This blog doesn’t get a lot of 
updates, but it does have some excellent tutorials.
 
✓ EEE PC Unofficial Blog (http://eeepc.net) — Primarily an Eee PC 
news blog with good content and frequent updates.
 
✓ EeeUser (www.eeeuser.com) — Home of the EeeUser forums and Wiki 
that I mentioned earlier in this chapter. Ant and other contributors also 
run this blog devoted to, you guessed it, the Eee PC.
 
✓ JKK Mobile (http://jkkmobile.com) — A great site covering 
ultra-mobile computers with an emphasis on the Eee PC. In addition 
to typical blog entries, the hosts also post a number of review and 
technical information videos.
 
✓ Liliputing (www.liliputing.com) — Another site devoted to small 
laptops. Lilliputian computing, get it? A good resource for the latest 
ASUS news as well as coverage of Eee PC competitors.
