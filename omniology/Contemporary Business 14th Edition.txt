“The 14th edition of Contemporary Business is dedicated to Joseph S. Heider, who brought me to 
John Wiley & Sons. Thank you, Joe.”
—Dave

During Dave Kurtz’s high school days, no one in Salisbury, Maryland, would 
have mistaken him for a scholar. In fact, he was a mediocre student, so bad that his father 
steered him toward higher education by finding him a succession of backbreaking sum-
mer jobs. Thankfully, most of them have been erased from his memory, but a few linger, 
including picking peaches, loading watermelons on trucks headed for market, and working 
as a pipefitter’s helper. Unfortunately, these jobs had zero impact on his academic standing. 
Worse yet for Dave’s ego, he was no better than average as a high school athlete in football 
and track.
But four years at Davis & Elkins College in Elkins, West Virginia, turned him around. 
Excellent instructors helped get Dave on a sound academic footing. His grade point aver-
age soared—enough to get him accepted by the graduate business school at the University 
of Arkansas, where he met Gene Boone. Gene and Dave became longtime co-authors; 
together they produced more than 50 books. In addition to writing, Dave and Gene were 
involved in several entrepreneurial ventures.
This long-term partnership ended with Gene’s death in 2005. But, this book will 
always be Boone & Kurtz’s Contemporary Business.
Today, Dave is back teaching at the University of Arkansas, after tours of duty in 
Ypsilanti, Michigan; Seattle, Washington; and Melbourne, Australia. He is the proud 
grandfather of six “perfect” kids and a sportsman with a golf handicap too high to men-
tion. Dave, his wife, Diane, and four demanding canine companions (Daisy, Lucy, Molly, 
and Sally) live in Rogers, Arkansas. Dave holds a distinguished professorship at the Sam M. 
Walton College of Business in nearby Fayetteville, home of the Arkansas Razorbacks.

Learning Styles
Have you ever repeated something to yourself over and over to help remember it? Or does your best friend ask you to draw a map 
to someplace where the two of you are planning to meet, rather than just tell her the directions? If so, then you already have an intui-
tive sense that people learn in different ways, Researchers in learning theory have developed various categories of learning styles. Some 
people, for example, learn best by reading or writing. Others learn best by using various senses—seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting, or even 
smelling. When you understand how you learn best, you can make use of learning strategies that will optimize the time you spend study-
ing. To find out what your particular learning style is, www.wiley.com/college/boone and take the learning styles quiz you find there. The 
quiz will help you determine your primary learning style:
Visual Learner 
 
 
Auditory Learner 
 
 
Haptic Learner 
 
 
Olfactory Learner
Print Learner 
 
 
Interactive Learner  
 
Kinesthetic Learner  
Then, consult the information below and on the following pages for study tips for each learning style. 
This information will help you better understand your learning style and how to apply it to the study of business.
Study Tips for Visual Learners
If you are a Visual Learner, you prefer to work with images and diagrams. It is important that you see information.
Visual Learning
• Draw charts/diagrams during lecture.
• Examine textbook figures and graphs.
• Look at images and videos on WileyPLUS 
and other Web sites.
• Pay close attention to charts, drawings, and 
handouts your instructor uses.
• Underline; use different colors.
• Use symbols, flowcharts, graphs, different 
arrangements on the page, white spaces.
Visual Reinforcement
• Make flashcards by drawing tables/charts on 
one side and definition or description on the 
other side.
• Use art-based worksheets; cover labels on 
images in text and then rewrite the labels.
• Use colored pencils/markers and colored 
paper to organize information into types.
• Convert your lecture notes into “page pic-
tures.” To do this:
– Use the visual learning strategies outlined 
above.
– Reconstruct images in different ways.
– Redraw pages from memory.
– Replace words with symbols and initials.
– Draw diagrams where appropriate.
– Practice turning your visuals back into 
words.
 
If visual learning is your weakness: If 
you are not a Visual Learner but want to 
improve your visual learning, try re-keying 
tables/charts from the textbook.
Study Tips for Print Learners
If you are a Print Learner, reading will be important but writing will be much more important.
Print Learning
• Write text lecture notes during lecture.
• Read relevant topics in textbook, especially 
textbook tables.
• Look at text descriptions in animations and 
Web sites.

endings.
• Write your lists in outline form.
• Arrange your words into hierarchies and 
points.
 
If print learning is your weakness: If you 
are not a Print Learner but want to improve 
your print learning, try covering labels of figures 
from the textbook and writing in the labels.
Study Tips for Auditory Learners
If you are an Auditory Learner, then you prefer listening as a way to learn information. Hearing will be very important, and sound helps you focus.
Auditory Learning
• Make audio recordings during lecture.

that you both ask and answer questions.
• Work in small group discussions, making a 
verbal and written discussion of what others say.

In Conclusion
I would like to thank Sue Nodine, Ingrid Benson, Heather Johnson, and the staff at Elm 
Street Publishing Services. Their unending efforts on behalf of Contemporary Business were 
truly extraordinary. I would also like to thank Tim Hatten at Mesa State College for his 
valuable feedback.
Let me conclude by noting that this new edition would never have become a reality 
without the outstanding efforts of the Wiley editorial, production, and marketing teams. 
Special thanks to George Hoffman, Lisé Johnson, Karolina Zarychta, Franny Kelly, and 
Maria Guarascio.

 I f the first thing you do when preparing to 
curl up with a good textbook like this one is to reach 
for your Snuggie, you have plenty of company. Sales 
of the funky blanket with sleeves were expected to 
reach as high as 20 million units in just the second 
year the cozy accessory was available. Combined 
with the 5 million blankets sold in the first year, that 
volume will bring the value of total retail sales of the 
Snuggie to more than $300 million.
That’s a respectable profit for an inexpensive product 
whose unique design and ungainly shape have made 
it the butt of YouTube parodies and late-night talk-
show jokes. It means Allstar Marketing Group, which 
markets the Snuggie, is obviously doing something 
right, though Scott Boilen, president of the company, 
does admit to being surprised at his unlikely 
product’s rapid rise to pop-culture success.
Despite being compared to a backwards coat, the 
fleecy Snuggie has ridden its growing popularity in 
two new directions: into much greater availability in 
a wider variety of stores and into a whole new range 
of styles and colors. Originally introduced in a now-
famous television ad that encouraged viewers to 
respond with a phone call to place their order, the 
Snuggie was soon being distributed directly through 
a few store chains, including obvious choices like 
Bed Bath & Beyond and drug store chains like 
Walgreens. By its second year, however, it was also 
available at campus bookstores and such high-end 
retailers as Lord & Taylor.
The Snuggie has so far been the centerpiece of two 
annual New York City fashion runway shows, the 
second of which brought an avalanche of publicity 
from the more than 300 news reports that followed 
the event. The blanket helped increase Internet sales 
from about 5 percent of Allstar’s business to about 
half over the last few years. And it’s become an 
official accessory of the rock band Weezer, which 
collaborated with Allstar to feature its own 
custom Snuggie (also available for sale) in a music 
video.
New Snuggie varieties include animal-print designs, 
Snuggies for kids, Snuggies for dogs (available in 
pet stores), and attention-getting Snuggies in a wide 
selection of official college colors complete with 
logos. More innovation is sure to come.
A recent spell of cold weather nearly exhausted 
stock of the Snuggie, and Allstar temporarily stopped 
its marketing effort while it replenished supplies. 
Being out of stock “is a nice problem to have,” said 
the company’s vice president of marketing, “but 
when people want their Snuggies, they want them 
now.” Some detractors have complained about the 
product’s quality, but its appeal has more to do 
with its status as a hot cultural icon than with its 
fit or even its durability. Meanwhile ardent Snuggie 
fan groups have organized Snuggie pub crawls, 
competitions, and get-togethers across the United 
States. Facebook boasts more than 300 Snuggie fan 
pages and twice as many groups.
Looking back on his surprise hit and the variety of 
ways in which consumers have become aware of it, 
Scott Boilen said, “You always need a combination 
of luck and a well-timed strategy. Snuggie took 
off with viral campaigns that were not part of us. 
Once we started seeing that, our whole marketing 
team got behind it.” While the Snuggie may be an 
unusual product, its story is one that’s becoming 
increasingly common in business today.1

Overview
1
Business is the nation’s engine for 
growth. A growing economy—one that 
produces more goods and services with 
fewer resources over time—yields income 
for business owners, their employees, and 
stockholders. So a country depends on the 
wealth its businesses generate, from large 
enterprises like the Walt Disney Company to 
tiny online startups, and from venerable firms 
like 150-year-old jeans maker Levi Strauss & 
Company to powerhouses like Google. What 
all these companies and many others share 
is a creative approach to meeting society’s 
needs and wants.
Businesses solve our transportation 
problems by marketing cars, tires, gasoline, 
and airline tickets. They bring food to our 
tables by growing, harvesting, processing, 
packaging, and shipping everything from 
spring water to cake mix and frozen shrimp. 
Restaurants buy, prepare, and serve food, 
and some even deliver. Construction compa-
nies build our schools, homes, and hospitals, 
while real estate firms bring property buyers 
and sellers together. Clothing manufacturers 
design, create, import, and deliver our jeans, 
sports shoes, work uniforms, and party wear. 
Entertainment for our leisure hours comes 
from hundreds of firms that create, pro-
duce, and distribute films, television shows, 
videogames, books, and music CDs and 
downloads.
To succeed, business firms must know 
what their customers want so that they can 
supply it quickly and efficiently. That means 
they often reflect changes in consumer tastes, 
such as the growing preference for sports 
drinks and vitamin-fortified water. But firms 
can also lead in advancing technology and 
other changes. They have the resources, 
the know-how, and the financial incentive 
to bring about real innovations, such as 
the iPad, new cancer treatments, and 
alternative energy sources like wind power. 
Thus, when businesses succeed, everybody 
wins.
You’ll see throughout this book that 
businesses require physical inputs like auto 
parts, chemicals, sugar, thread, and electric-
ity, as well as the accumulated knowledge and 
experience of their managers and employees. 
Yet they also rely heavily on their own abil-
ity to change with the times and with the 
marketplace. Flexibility is a key to long-term 
success—and to growth.
In short, business is at the forefront of 
our economy—and Contemporary Business is 
right there with it. This book explores the 
strategies that allow companies to grow and 
compete in today’s interactive marketplace, 
along with the skills that you will need to 
turn ideas into action for your own success in 
business. This chapter sets the stage for the 
entire text by defining business and revealing 
its role in society. The chapter’s discussion 
illustrates how the private enterprise system 
encourages competition and innovation while 
preserving business ethics.

What Is Business?
What comes to mind when you hear the word busi-
ness? Do you think of big corporations like ExxonMobil 
or Target? Or does the local bakery or shoe store pop 
into your mind? Maybe you recall your first summer 
job. The term business is a broad, all-inclusive term that 
can be applied to many kinds of enterprises. Businesses 
provide the bulk of employment opportunities, as well 
as the products that people enjoy.
Business consists of all profit-seeking activities and 
enterprises that provide goods and services necessary to 
an economic system. Some businesses produce tangible 
goods, such as automobiles, breakfast cereals, and digital 
music players; others provide services such as insurance, 
hair styling, and entertainment ranging from Six Flags 
theme parks and sports events to concerts.
Business drives the economic pulse of a nation. It 
provides the means through which its citizens’ standard 
of living improves. At the heart of every business endeavor is an exchange between a buyer 
and a seller. A buyer recognizes a need for a good or service and trades money with a seller 
to obtain that product. The seller participates in the process in hopes of gaining profits—a 
main ingredient in accomplishing the goals necessary for continuous improvement in the 
standard of living.
Profits represent rewards for businesspeople who take the risks involved in blending 
people, technology, and information to create and market want-satisfying goods and services. 
In contrast, accountants think of profits as the difference between a firm’s revenues and the 
expenses it incurs in generating these revenues. More generally, however, profits serve as 
incentives for people to start companies, expand them, and provide consistently high-quality 
competitive goods and services.
The quest for profits is a central focus of business because without profits, a company 
could not survive. But businesspeople also recognize their social and ethical responsibilities. 
To succeed in the long run, companies must deal responsibly with employees, customers, 
suppliers, competitors, government, and the general public.
Not-for-Profit Organizations
What do Ohio State’s athletic department, the U.S. Postal Service, the American Red 
Cross, and your local library have in common? They are all classified as not-for-profit 
organizations, businesslike establishments that have primary objectives other than return-
ing profits to their owners. These organizations play important roles in society by placing 
public service above profits, although it is important to understand that these organizations 
need to raise money so that they can operate and achieve their social goals. Not-for-profit 
organizations operate in both the private and public sectors. Private-sector not-for-profits 
include museums, libraries, trade associations, and charitable and religious organizations.

Government agencies, political parties, and labor unions, all of which are part of the public 
sector, are also classified as not-for-profit organizations.
Not-for-profit organizations are a substantial part of the U.S. economy. Currently, more 
than 1.5 million nonprofit organizations are registered with the Internal Revenue Service in 
the United States, in categories ranging from arts and culture to science and technology.2 
These organizations control more than $2.6 trillion in assets and employ more people than 
the federal government and all 50 state governments combined.3 In addition, millions of vol-
unteers work for them in unpaid positions. Not-for-profits secure funding from both private 
sources, including donations, and government sources. They are commonly exempt from 
federal, state, and local taxes.
Although they focus on goals other than generating profits, managers of not-for-profit 
organizations face many of the same challenges as executives of profit-seeking businesses. 
Without funding, they cannot do research, obtain raw materials, or provide services. St. Jude 
Children’s Research Hospital’s pediatric treatment and research facility in Memphis treats 
nearly 5,000 children a year for catastrophic diseases, mainly cancer, immune system prob-
lems, and infectious and genetic disorders. Patients come from all 50 states and all over the 
world and are accepted without regard to the family’s ability to pay. To provide top-quality 
care and to support its research in gene therapy, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplanta-
tion, and the psychological effects of illness, among many other critical areas, St. Jude relies 
on contributions, with some assistance from federal grants and investments.4
Other not-for-profits mobilize their resources to respond to emergencies, as the Red 
Cross and Doctors without Borders did following the devastating earthquake in Haiti that 
left hundreds of thousands of families homeless. Relief agencies around the world struggled 
to supply enough tents and tarpaulins for immediate shelter and turn their attention to more 
permanent construction as soon as it was feasible.5

Some not-for-profits sell merchandise or set up profit-generating arms to provide goods 
and services for which people are willing and able to pay. College bookstores sell everything 
from sweatshirts to coffee mugs with school logos imprinted on them, while the Sierra 
Club and the Appalachian Mountain Club both have full-fledged publishing programs. The 
Lance Armstrong Foundation has sold more than 40 million yellow LiveStrong wristbands 
as well as sports gear and accessories for men, women, and children in the United States 
and abroad, with the money earmarked to fight cancer and support patients and families.6 
Handling merchandising programs like these, as well as launching other fund-raising cam-
paigns, requires managers of not-for-profit organizations to develop effective business skills 
and experience. Consequently, many of the concepts discussed in this book apply to 
not-for-profit organizations as well as to profit-oriented firms.
Factors of Production
An economic system requires certain inputs for successful operation. Economists use 
the term factors of production to refer to the four basic inputs: natural resources, capital, 
human resources, and entrepreneurship. Table 1.1 identifies each of these inputs and the 
type of payment received by firms and individuals who supply them.
Natural resources include all production inputs that are useful in their natural states, 
including agricultural land, building sites, forests, and mineral deposits. The largest wind 
farm in the world, the Roscoe Wind Complex near Roscoe, Texas, generates enough power 
to support almost a quarter million homes. Natural resources are the basic inputs required in 
any economic system.
Capital, another key resource, includes technology, tools, information, and physical 
facilities. Technology is a broad term that refers to such machinery and equipment as com-
puters and software, telecommunications, and inventions designed to improve production. 
Information, frequently improved by technological innovations, is another critical factor 
because both managers and operating employees require accurate, timely information for 
effective performance of their assigned tasks. Technology plays an important role in the 
success of many businesses. Sometimes technology results in a new product, such as hybrid 
autos that run on a combination of gasoline and electricity. Most of the major car companies 
have introduced hybrid versions of their best-sellers in recent years.
Sometimes technology helps a company improve a product. Amazon.com’s popular 
wireless reading device, the Kindle, uses Sprint’s high-speed wireless network to free e-book 
readers from the need to download books via computer. Already in its second generation, it’s

also small and comfortable enough to be held in your hands with improved battery life and 
storage capacity. Weighing in at considerably less than a pound, the Kindle reflects light for 
ease of reading and generates little heat.7
And sometimes technology helps a company operate more smoothly by tracking deliv-
eries, providing more efficient communication, analyzing data, or training employees. The 
U.S. Postal Service, for example, is cutting costs by expanding the electronic side of its 
business. Although its attempts to provide electronic bill payment proved unsuccessful, the 
USPS lets customers order stamps and shipping supplies online and offers merchants like 
L.L. Bean and eBay the means to buy postage online and create merchandise shipping and 
return tickets. Automation, bar coding, and electronic kiosks are providing many services 
postal clerks used to perform.8
To remain competitive, a firm needs to continually acquire, maintain, and upgrade its 
capital, and businesses need money for that purpose. A company’s funds may come from 
owner-investments, profits plowed back into the business, or loans extended by others. 
Money then goes to work building factories; purchasing raw materials and component parts; 
and hiring, training, and compensating workers. People and firms that supply capital receive 
factor payments in the form of interest.
Human resources represent another critical input in every economic system. Human 
resources include anyone who works, from the chief executive officer (CEO) of a huge 
corporation to a self-employed editor. This category encompasses both the physical labor 
and the intellectual inputs contributed by workers. Companies rely on their employees as 
a valued source of ideas and innovation, as well as physical effort. Some companies solicit 
employee ideas through traditional means, such as an online “suggestion box” or in staff 
meetings. Others encourage creative thinking during company-sponsored hiking or rafting 
trips or during social gatherings. Effective, well-trained human resources provide a signifi-
cant competitive edge because competitors cannot easily match another company’s talented,

motivated employees in the way they can buy the same computer system or purchase the 
same grade of natural resources.
Hiring and keeping the right people matters, as we’ll see later in the case at the end of 
this chapter. SAS continues to be a great place to work in part due to the attention the firm 
pays to retain their employees.9
Entrepreneurship is the willingness to take risks to create and operate a business. An 
entrepreneur is someone who sees a potentially profitable opportunity and then devises a 
plan to achieve success in the marketplace and earn those profits. Craig Rabin has big plans

U.S. businesses operate within an economic system called the private enterprise system. 
The next section looks at the private enterprise system, including competition, private prop-
erty, and the entrepreneurship alternative.
The Private Enterprise System
No business operates in a vacuum. All operate within a larger economic system that 
determines how goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed in a society. 
The type of economic system employed in a society also determines patterns of resource use. 
Some economic systems, such as communism, feature strict controls on business ownership, 
profits, and resources to accomplish government goals.
In the United States, businesses function within the private enterprise system, an 
economic system that rewards firms for their ability to identify and serve the needs and 
demands of customers. The private enterprise system minimizes government interference in 
economic activity. Businesses that are adept at satisfying customers gain access to necessary 
factors of production and earn profits.
Another name for the private enterprise system is capitalism. Adam Smith, often iden-
tified as the father of capitalism, first described the concept in his book The Wealth of Nations, 
published in 1776. Smith believed that an economy is best regulated by the “invisible hand” 
of competition, the battle among businesses for consumer acceptance. Smith thought that 
competition among firms would lead to consumers’ receiving the best possible products and 
prices because less efficient producers would gradually be driven from the marketplace.
The “invisible hand” concept is a basic premise of the private enterprise system. In the 
United States, competition regulates much of economic life. To compete successfully, each 
firm must find a basis for competitive differentiation, the unique combination of orga-
nizational abilities, products, and approaches that sets a company apart from competitors in 
the minds of customers. Businesses operating in a private enterprise system face a critical 
task of keeping up with changing marketplace conditions. Firms that fail to adjust to shifts in 
consumer preferences or ignore the actions of competitors leave themselves open to 
failure. Google, for instance, continues to challenge Microsoft’s dominance in the market 
for business word-processing and spreadsheet software. It is expected to enable its Marketing 
Solutions Web site to sell third-party software to Google Apps customers. In the short time 
since it began its expansion into enterprise business applications, Google reports adding 
almost 2 million organizations for Gmail and Google Docs, an aggressive launch to which 
Microsoft must respond.11

In early 2010 Google launched the NexusOne in an effort to compete in the smart 
phone market; see the “Hit & Miss” feature.
Throughout this book, our discussion focuses on the tools and methods that 21st-
century businesses apply to compete and differentiate their goods and services. We also 
discuss many of the ways in which market changes will affect business and the private enter-
prise system in the years ahead.
Basic Rights in the Private Enterprise System
For capitalism to operate effectively, the citizens of a private enterprise economy must 
have certain rights. As shown in Figure 1.1, these include the rights to private property, 
profits, freedom of choice, and competition.
The right to private property is the most basic freedom under the private enterprise 
system. Every participant has the right to own, use, buy, sell, and bequeath most forms of 
property, including land, buildings, machinery, equipment, patents on inventions, individual 
possessions, and intangible properties.
The private enterprise system also guarantees business owners the right to all profits—
after taxes—they earn through their activities. Although a business is not assured of earning a 
profit, its owner is legally and ethically entitled to any income it generates in excess of costs.

Google took a big step into Microsoft-dominated territory with 
its introduction of home and office tools like Gmail and Google Docs, 
and especially with its own operating system, Chrome OS, to challenge 
Microsoft’s long-running Windows series. Google even has a Web 
browser, also called Chrome, to compete with Microsoft’s entrenched 
Internet Explorer, while Microsoft challenges Google’s dominance in 
Internet searches with its new search engine, Bing. 
Google has long supported Web-based applications, as opposed 
to the desk-top applications that have been Microsoft’s specialty, but 
Microsoft is fighting back. It’s creating browser-based versions of its 
desktop Office products including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to 
compete with Google’s cloud-computing tools. Microsoft’s applications, 
often known for growing by adding more and more features in each 
new generation, will have to match Google’s successful focus on speed 
and ease of use. Google has used these characteristics to promote a 
great user experience with its PC products, an advantage it hopes to 
import into the business applications market. “We want to spoil people 
like heck in their personal lives,” says Google’s vice president of prod-
uct management. “Then when they go to work, they should be asking 
the question, ‘Why are things so hard?’”
Google credits some of its success to its design teams’ unwilling-
ness to settle for the status quo. “I don’t think our Docs team has ever 
been fundamentally happy with their product,” said the president of 
the company’s enterprise group. That restlessness means shortfalls in 
any Google product’s performance may be short-lived. Google Docs, 
for instance, can’t yet match Microsoft Word’s editing and page layout 
features, while Google Spreadsheets offers limited performance and 
scaling capabilities.
Google is so determined to solve such problems, however, that it’s 
helping to shape the creation of the World Wide Web’s new HTML5 
language, the standard for structuring and presenting content on Web 
pages and Web-based documents. “We view the Web as a platform,” 
says Google’s enterprise product management director. “We don’t view 
it as a companion to the desktop. . . . We want the vast majority of 
users of Microsoft Office to be able to easily switch to Google Docs.”

Freedom of choice means that a private enterprise system 
relies on the potential for citizens to choose their own employ-
ment, purchases, and investments. They can change jobs, negoti-
ate wages, join labor unions, and choose among many different 
brands of goods and services. People living in the capitalist 
nations of North America, Europe, and other parts of the world 
are so accustomed to this freedom of choice that they sometimes 
forget its importance. A private enterprise economy maximizes 
individual prosperity by providing alternatives. Other economic 
systems sometimes limit freedom of choice to accomplish gov-
ernment goals, such as increasing industrial production of cer-
tain items or military strength.
The private enterprise system also permits fair competition 
by allowing the public to set rules for competitive activity. For 
this reason, the U.S. government has passed laws to prohibit 
“cutthroat” competition—excessively aggressive competitive prac-
tices designed to eliminate competition. It also has established 
ground rules that outlaw price discrimination, fraud in financial 
markets, and deceptive advertising and packaging. The Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) recently closed a loophole 
in its rules that will help increase competition in the cable industry by forcing major compa-
nies to give up their exclusive rights to broadcast certain sports channels. “Consumers who 
want to switch video providers shouldn’t have to give up their favorite team in the process,” 
the FCC chairperson said. “Today the Commission levels the competitive playing field.”12
The Entrepreneurship Alternative
The entrepreneurial spirit beats at the heart of private enterprise. An entrepreneur is 
a risk taker in the private enterprise system. You hear about entrepreneurs all the time—two 
college students starting a software business in their dorm room or a mom who invents a 
better baby carrier. Many times their success is modest, but once in a while, the risk pays off 
in huge profits. Individuals who recognize marketplace opportunities are free to use their 
capital, time, and talents to pursue those opportunities for profit. The willingness of individ-
uals to start new ventures drives economic growth and keeps pressure on existing companies 
to continue to satisfy customers. If no one were willing to take economic risks, the private 
enterprise system wouldn’t exist.
By almost any measure, the entrepreneurial spirit fuels growth in the U.S. economy. 
Of all the businesses operating in the United States, about one in seven firms started opera-
tions during the past year. These newly formed businesses are also the source of many of 
the nation’s new jobs. Every year, they create more than one of every five new jobs in the 
economy. Most measures of entrepreneurship count the smallest or youngest businesses on 
the assumption that they are the enterprises in which entrepreneurship is most significant. 
These companies are a significant source of employment or self-employment. Of the nearly 
27 million U.S. small businesses currently in operation, more than 20 million are self-
employed people without any employees. More than 21 million U.S. employees currently 
work for a business with fewer than 20 employees.13 Does starting a business require higher 
education? Not necessarily, although it can help. Figure 1.2 presents the results of a survey 
of small-business owners, which shows that about 24 percent of all respondents had gradu-
ated from college, and 19 percent had postgraduate degrees.

Besides creating jobs and selling products, entre-
preneurship provides the benefits of innovation. In 
contrast to more established firms, start-up companies 
tend to innovate most in fields of technology that 
are new and uncrowded with competitors, making 
new products available to businesses and consum-
ers. Because small companies are more flexible, they 
can make changes to products and processes more 
quickly than larger corporations. Entrepreneurs often 
find new ways to use natural resources, technology, 
and other factors of production. Often, they do this 
because they have to—they may not have enough 
money to build an expensive prototype or launch a 
nationwide ad campaign. Sometimes an entrepreneur 
may innovate by simply tweaking an existing idea. 
Eric Hansen, owner of Competitive Lawn Care, a 
small lawn-care service in Illinois, wanted to prepare 
his business for a potential downturn during the 
2009–2010 recession. He came up with the idea of 
running all the company’s lawnmowers on propane, 
which would save money and reduce noise. A year-long journey to make his idea a reality 
took him from local government offices to obtain approval for opening the first private pro-
pane filling station in the country, to Kentucky to search for new equipment, and all the way 
to Europe to research technology from around the world. Says Hansen, “I am proud to say 
that after a year of hard work, Competitive Lawn Service Inc. will be the first company in 
the country to have a commercial lawn maintenance crew to operate 100 percent on propane 
as an alternative fuel, as well as a private propane fill station at our location. And our grow-
ing list of commercial and residential clients are listening and applauding. The future looks 
bright . . . and we are ready. Ready to branch out, expand, open new locations, and go where 
no company has gone before in the direction of alternative fuels, quality service, and a pas-
sion for making a difference in this world.”14
Entrepreneurship is also important to 
existing companies in a private enterprise 
system. More and more, large firms are rec-
ognizing the value of entrepreneurial thinking 
among their employees, hoping to benefit 
from enhanced flexibility, improved innova-
tion, and new market opportunities. Apple 
reaches out to its customers as well, invit-
ing individual entrepreneurs of all kinds to 
develop applications for the iPhone and mak-
ing it possible for them to profit from their 
efforts if the apps are successful. There are 
already more than 140,000 different applica-
tions for the device, including some devel-
oped by Apple itself, and all together they’ve 
been downloaded billions of times.15

neurs have played a vital role in the history of

industries, developed successful new business methods, and improved U.S. standing in global 
competition.
Six Eras in the History of Business
In the roughly 400 years since the first European settlements appeared on the North 
American continent, amazing changes have occurred in the size, focus, and goals of U.S. busi-
nesses. As Figure 1.3 indicates, U.S. business history is divided into six distinct time periods: 
(1) the Colonial period, (2) the Industrial Revolution, (3) the age of industrial entrepreneurs, 
(4) the production era, (5) the marketing era, and (6) the relationship era. The next sections 
describe how events in each of these time periods have influenced U.S. business practices.
The Colonial Period
Colonial society emphasized rural and agricultural production. Colonial towns were 
small compared with European cities, and they functioned as marketplaces for farmers and 
craftspeople. The economic focus of the nation centered on rural areas, because prosperity 
depended on the output of farms and plantations. The success or failure of crops influenced 
every aspect of the economy.
Colonists depended on England for manufactured items as well as financial backing for 
their infant industries. Even after the Revolutionary War (1776–1783), the United States 
maintained close economic ties with 
England. British investors continued 
to provide much of the financing for 
developing the U.S. business system, 
and this financial influence contin-
ued well into the 19th century.
The Industrial 
Revolution
The Industrial Revolution 
began in England around 1750. It 
moved business operations from an 
emphasis on independent, skilled 
workers who specialized in building 
products one by one to a factory 
system that mass-produced items by 
bringing together large numbers of 
semiskilled workers. The factories 
profited from the savings created by 
large-scale production, bolstered by 
increasing support from machines 
over time. As businesses grew, they 
could often purchase raw materi-
als more cheaply in larger lots than

before. Specialization of labor, limiting each worker to a few specific tasks in the production 
process, also improved production efficiency.
Influenced by these events in England, business in the United States began a time of 
rapid industrialization. Agriculture became mechanized, and factories sprang up in cities. 
During the mid-1800s, the pace of the revolution was increased as newly built railroad sys-
tems provided fast, economical transportation. In California, for example, the combination 
of railroad construction and the gold rush fueled a tremendous demand for construction.
The Age of Industrial Entrepreneurs
Building on the opportunities created by the Industrial Revolution, entrepreneurship 
increased in the United States. In 1900, Arthur R. Wilson and several partners paid $10,000 
in gold coins for a 27-acre parcel of granite-rich land in California. This natural resource was 
the basis for the Granite Rock Co., which provided the material for roads and buildings in 
California’s booming economy. The company, now called Graniterock, evolved in response 
to technological, competitive, and marketplace demands and continues to survive in the 21st 
century. Today the firm, which has stores throughout California, offers consumer products 
such as granite countertops as well as many “green” products made from recycled materials.16
Inventors created a virtually endless array of commercially useful products and new pro-
duction methods. Many of them are famous today:
 
•  Eli Whitney introduced the concept of interchangeable parts, an idea that would later 
facilitate mass production on a previously impossible scale.
 •  Robert McCormick designed a horse-drawn reaper that reduced the labor involved in 
harvesting wheat. His son, Cyrus McCormick, saw the commercial potential of the reap-
er and launched a business to build and sell the machine. By 1902, the company 
was producing 35 percent of the nation’s farm machinery.
 •  Cornelius Vanderbilt (railroads), J. P. Morgan (banking), and Andrew Carnegie (steel), 
among others, took advantage of the enormous opportunities waiting for anyone willing 
to take the risk of starting a new business.
The entrepreneurial spirit of this golden age in 
business did much to advance the U.S. business system 
and raise the overall standard of living of its citizens. 
That market transformation, in turn, created new 
demand for manufactured goods.
The Production Era
As demand for manufactured goods continued to 
increase through the 1920s, businesses focused even 
greater attention on the activities involved in producing 
those goods. Work became increasingly specialized, and 
huge, labor-intensive factories dominated U.S. business. 
Assembly lines, introduced by Henry Ford, became 
commonplace in major industries. Business owners 
turned over their responsibilities to a new class of

managers trained in operating established companies. Their activities emphasized efforts to 
produce even more goods through quicker methods.
During the production era, business focused attention on internal processes rather than 
external influences. Marketing was almost an afterthought, designed solely to distribute 
items generated by production activities. Little attention was paid to consumer wants or 
needs. Instead, businesses tended to make decisions about what the market would get. If you 
wanted to buy a Ford Model T automobile, your color choice was black—the only color 
produced by the company.
The Marketing Era
The Great Depression of the early 1930s changed the shape of U.S. business yet again. 
As incomes nose-dived, businesses could no longer automatically count on selling everything 
they produced. Managers began to pay more attention to the markets for their goods and 
services, and sales and advertising took on new importance. During this period, selling was 
often synonymous with marketing.
Demand for all kinds of consumer goods exploded after World War II. After nearly five 
years of doing without new automobiles, appliances, and other items, consumers were buy-
ing again. At the same time, however, competition also heated up. Soon businesses began to 
think of marketing as more than just selling; they envisioned a process of determining what 
consumers wanted and needed and then designing products to satisfy those needs. In short, 
they developed a consumer orientation.
Businesses began to analyze consumer desires before beginning actual production. 
Consumer choices skyrocketed. Automobiles came in a wide variety of colors and styles, and 
car buyers could choose among them. Companies also discovered the need to distinguish 
their goods and services from those of competitors. Branding—the process of creating an 
identity in consumers’ minds for a good, service, or company—is an important marketing 
tool. A brand can be a name, term, sign, symbol, design, or some combination that identi-
fies the products of one firm and differentiates them from competitors’ offerings.
The Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement specialty retailer, operates 
more than 2,200 retail stores in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and China and exports 
products around the world. Its carefully guarded brand name stands for excellent customer 
service, an entrepreneurial spirit, and the desire to give something back to the communi-
ties in which it operates. The company sells thousands of products, some under its own 
sub-brands including RIDGID® tools, BEHR® paint, LG® appliances, and Toro® lawn 
equipment.17
The marketing era has had a tremendous effect on the way business is conducted today. 
Even the smallest business owners recognize the importance of understanding what custom-
ers want and the reasons they buy.
The Relationship Era
As business continues in the 21st century, a significant change is taking place in the ways 
companies interact with customers. Since the Industrial Revolution, most businesses have 
concentrated on building and promoting products in the hope that enough customers will 
buy them to cover costs and earn acceptable profits, an approach called transaction 
management.

In contrast, in the relationship era, businesses are taking a different, longer-term 
approach to their interactions with customers. Firms now seek ways to actively nurture 
customer loyalty by carefully managing every interaction. They earn enormous paybacks 
for their efforts. A company that retains customers over the long haul reduces its advertis-
ing and sales costs. Because customer spending tends to accelerate over time, revenues 
also grow. Companies with long-term customers often can avoid costly reliance on price 
discounts to attract new business, and they find that many new buyers come from loyal cus-
tomer referrals.
Business owners gain several advantages by developing ongoing relationships with cus-
tomers. Because it is much less expensive to serve existing customers than to find new ones, 
businesses that develop long-term customer relationships can reduce their overall costs. 
Long-term relationships with customers enable businesses to improve their understanding 
of what customers want and prefer from the company. As a result, businesses enhance their 
chances of sustaining real advantages through competitive differentiation.
The relationship era is an age of connections—between businesses and customers, 
employers and employees, technology and manufacturing, and even separate companies. 
The world economy is increasingly interconnected, as businesses expand beyond their 
national boundaries. In this new environment, techniques for managing networks of people, 
businesses, information, and technology are critically important to contemporary business 
success. As you begin your own career, you will soon see how important relationships are, 
including your online presence; see the “Business Etiquette” feature for suggestions on 
presenting yourself in a positive way through social networking.
Managing Relationships through Technology
Increasingly, businesses focus on relationship management, the collection of activi-
ties that build and maintain ongoing, mutually beneficial ties with customers and other 
parties. At its core, relationship management involves gathering knowledge of customer 
needs and preferences and applying that understanding to get as close to the customer as 
possible. Many of these activities are based on technology, or the business application of 
knowledge based on scientific discoveries, inventions, and innovations. In managing rela-
tionships with customers, technology most often takes the form of communication, via the 
Internet and cell phone.
Blogs are growing more influential as a link between companies and their custom-
ers, and more companies are beginning to take advantage of their directness. Some that 
are connecting with customers in a positive way through their company blogs are Kodak, 
Walmart, Patagonia, and LinkedIn.18 Google recently used its corporate blog both to 
announce its new Buzz social networking product and to calm angry users with announce-
ments about needed changes in the service; see the “Hit & Miss” feature for an example of 
relationship-building through technology.
Strategic Alliances
Businesses are also finding that they must form partnerships with other organizations to 
take full advantage of available opportunities. One form of partnership between organiza-
tions is a strategic alliance, a partnership formed to create a competitive advantage for the 
businesses involved.

Social Networking
Most young people hear a lot of career advice, and one reliably good tip is to 
build a network of personal contacts in your chosen ﬁ eld. The social networks 
blossoming online make this especially easy—but the Internet’s informality 
can also make it tricky to network in a professional way. Here are suggestions 
for presenting yourself in a positive light on sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and 
others.
1 
Know the purpose of the networking site you choose. Most people con-
sider Facebook more social, while LinkedIn purposely maintains a more 
professional look and feel.
2 
Remember that potential employers, mentors, and other professionals will 
check your Facebook page to learn about you, despite the site’s mostly 
fun-oriented proﬁ le. Look objectively at what they’ll see there.
3 Review and edit posted photos to be sure they present the image you’re 
after.
4 
Resist the impulse to share. Keep your posts brief and neither overly de-
tailed nor overly personal. People you hope to tap for potential job leads 
don’t need to know what you had for breakfast. Strictly limit information 
about family members, too.
5 
To network with someone you haven’t met, ﬁ nd someone you have in 
common and ask that person to make an online introduction.
6 
Contribute to the community. “Help the people around you and you help 
yourself,” advises one author. Posting interesting information about your 
area of professional expertise is one way of helping the community and 
building relationships.
7

E-business has created a whole new 
type of strategic alliance. A firm whose entire 
business is conducted online, such as Amazon 
or Overstock.com, may team up with traditional 
retailers that contribute their expertise in buying 
the right amount of the right merchandise, as 
well as their knowledge of distribution. 
Overstock.com, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, 
is an online-only retailer designed for bargain 
hunters looking for brand-name consumer 
goods including clothing, appliances, electronics, 
and sporting goods at discount prices. The 
manufacturers and distributors that Overstock.
com partners with gain a new avenue for reduc-
ing their inventory and allow the firm to carry 
over 2 million different products on its Web site. 
Overstock.com earned revenues of more than 
$800 million in one recent year and received 
several top customer service awards.19
The Green Advantage
Another way of building relationships is 
to incorporate issues that your customers care 
about into your business. As environmental 
concerns continue to influence consumers’ 
choices of everything from yogurt to cloth-
ing to cars and light bulbs, many observers say 
the question about “going green” is no longer 
whether, but how. The need to develop envi-
ronmentally friendly products and processes is 
becoming a major new force in business today. 
Companies in every industry are researching 
ways to save energy, cut emissions and pollu-
tion, reduce waste, and, not incidentally, save 
money and increase profits as well. The family-
owned Bigelow Tea Company is working with 
Connecticut’s Clean Energy Fund to install 
solar panels on four different building levels 
at its headquarters in Fairfield. The panels are 
expected to supply almost 7 percent of the build-
ing’s electrical energy needs, equivalent to the 
power used by 22 average homes.20
Energy is among the biggest costs for most 
firms, and carbon-based fuels such as coal are 
responsible for most of the additional carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere. Ford Motor Company 
is upgrading lighting fixtures in its manufacturing

facilities, replacing old inefficient equipment with fluorescent lighting that saves energy 
and money and including motion detectors that reduce energy use during periods of low 
activity.21 Clean solar energy is coming into its own and may soon be more viable and more 
widely available. SolarCity, a California installer of rooftop solar cells, is having trouble 
keeping up with growing demand. “It is hard to find installers,” says the company’s CEO. 
“We’re at the stage where if we continue to grow at this pace, we won’t be able to sustain 
the growth.”22
Some “green” initiatives can themselves be costly for firms. General Electric, however, 
with its Ecomagination line of environmentally friendly products, is among those that have 
realized thinking “green” can satisfy not only consumers’ environmental concerns but also 
those of shareholders by saving money and earning profits. “We’ve sold out in eco-cer-
tified products for [a year in advance],” says Bob Corcoran, the company’s vice president 
for corporate citizenship, and energy-saving wind turbines are backordered for two years. 
Once criticized for its pollution of New York’s Hudson River, the firm has helped form 
the U.S. Climate Action Partnership to push for a cap on carbon emissions in the United 
States. GE believes it is doing what its shareholders expect it to do. “No good business can 
call itself a good corporate citizen if it fritters away shareholder money,” Corcoran says.23
Each new era in U.S. business history has forced managers to reexamine the tools and 
techniques they formerly used to compete. Tomorrow’s managers will need creativity and 
vision to stay on top of rapidly changing technology and to manage complex relationships in 
As originally conceived, Google’s Buzz must have sounded like a 
great idea: “a new way to start conversations about things you find 
interesting” that was “built right into Gmail, so you don’t have to 
peck out an entirely new set of friends from scratch—it just works.” 
Unfortunately, the features designed to make adopting Buzz effortless 
created an instant uproar over users’ privacy.
Planned to compete with Facebook and Twitter, Buzz offered 
users a ready-made social network through an “auto-follow” func-
tion that automatically networked their most frequent Gmail contacts. 
It also automatically connected users with Picasa photo albums and 
links and videos shared on Google Reader. Tens of millions around 
the world reportedly sampled the new service in its first two days, 
posting more than 9 million messages and comments. Most, 
however, were angry and dismayed to discover how much personal 
information the auto-follow and other features made public within 
the network.
Within 48 hours Google announced steps to correct privacy con-
cerns, including changing to an auto-suggest feature and making it 
easier for users to modify or disable the program. “We’re very sorry for 
the concern we’ve caused and have been working hard ever since to 
improve things based on your feedback,” Buzz’s product manager told 
users. “We’ll continue to do so.”
Though some observers still worried that “Gmail users are being 
driven into a social networking service . . . they didn’t sign up for,” 
others conceded the high level of interest in Buzz suggested “Google 
might have a minor hit on its hands already.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Can a company carry its customer relationship-building 
efforts too far?
2. Do you think Google will recover customers’ goodwill 
after introducing new privacy features into its Buzz net-
work?

Exelon Bets on Nuclear
“Time is not our friend with respect to global climate change. . . . 
the usual approach—doing too much, too late—will not work.” So 
says John Rowe, CEO of the utility company Exelon, a recent winner of 
the National Safety Council’s Green Cross for Safety. Exelon is betting 
on the world’s growing demand for renewable energy sources to cre-
ate a sound financial future for the company and its stakeholders while 
minimizing its environmental impact.
Created in 2000 from a merger between utility companies in 
Chicago and Philadelphia, Exelon sold most of its underperforming coal 
plants to focus on nuclear power generation. Its fleet of 17 reactors is 
the world’s third-largest, topped only by utilities in France and Russia. 
Exelon earns $17 billion in sales and close to $3 billion in profits a year, 
returning more than twice as much to shareholders as other utilities. 
Its nuclear plants produce about 130 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity 
each year and have reduced greenhouse gas emissions more than 
35 percent from earlier levels. That’s equivalent to taking a million 
passenger cars off the road.
Legislation to cap or more heavily regulate carbon emissions will 
force Exelon’s carbon-dependent competitors to raise prices. “I thought 
climate legislation would come sooner or later and that I’d rather have 
my money in the nuke fleet,” says Rowe. The company plans to further 
shrink its carbon footprint by 2020 by eliminating more than 15 million 
metric tons of potential greenhouse gas emissions every year.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Exelon has tried and failed to acquire three smaller rival 
companies. What role, if any, do you think strategic part-
nerships might play in the company’s future?
2. Exelon is the most valuable U.S. utility company in terms 
of market value and derives 92 percent of its power from 
nuclear plants. Do you think being environmentally aware 
and being profitable are compatible goals for a business? 
Why or why not?

the global business world of the fast-paced 21st century. As green operations become more 
cost-effective, and consumers and shareholders demand more responsive management, few 
firms will choose to be left behind. For a look at management issues in the energy industry, 
see the “Going Green” feature.
Today’s Business Workforce
A skilled and knowledgeable workforce is an essential resource for keeping pace with 
the accelerating rate of change in today’s business world. Employers need reliable workers 
who are dedicated to fostering strong ties with customers and partners. They must build 
workforces capable of efficient, high-quality production needed to compete in global mar-
kets. Savvy business leaders also realize that the brainpower of employees plays a vital role 
in a firm’s ability to stay on top of new technologies and innovations. In short, a first-class 
workforce can be the foundation of a firm’s competitive differentiation, providing important 
advantages over competing businesses.
Changes in the Workforce
Companies now face several trends that challenge their skills for managing and devel-
oping human resources. Those challenges include aging of the population and a shrinking 
labor pool, growing diversity of the workforce, the changing nature of work, the need for 
flexibility and mobility, and the use of collaboration to innovate.
Aging of the Population and Shrinking Labor Pool By 2030, the 
number of U.S. workers 65 or older will reach 72 million—double what it is today—and 
many of them will retire from the workforce, taking their experience and expertise with 
them. As Table 1.2 shows, the U.S. population as a whole is trending older. Yet today, many 
members of the Baby Boom generation, the huge number of people born between 1946 
and 1964, are still hitting the peaks of their careers. At the same time, members of so-called 
Generation X (born from 1965 to 1981) and Generation Y (born from 1982 to 2005) are 
building their careers, so employers are finding more generations in the workforce simul-
taneously than ever before. This broad age diversity brings management challenges with 
it, such as accommodating a variety of work-life styles, changing expectations of work, and 
varying levels of technological expertise. Still, despite the widening age spectrum of the 
workforce, some economists predict the U.S. labor pool could soon fall short by as many as 
10 million people as the Baby Boomers retire.
More sophisticated technology has intensified the hiring challenge by requiring work-
ers to have ever more advanced skills. Although the number of college-educated workers has 
doubled in the past 20 years, the demand is still greater than the supply of these individuals. 
Because of these changes, companies are increasingly seeking—and finding—talent at the 
extreme ends of the working-age spectrum. Teenagers are entering the workforce sooner, 
and some seniors are staying longer—or seeking new careers after retiring from their 
primary careers. Many older workers work part-time or flexible hours. Dick Chevrette

worked for 38 years as a manager at Massachusetts General Hospital. When he hit 62, 
he wanted to still be mentally challenged and active so he scaled back his hours but didn’t 
stop working. Meanwhile, for those older employees who do retire, employers must 
administer a variety of retirement planning and disability programs, retraining, and 
insurance benefits.
Increasingly Diverse Workforce The U.S. workforce is growing more 
diverse, in age and in every other way as well. The two fastest-growing ethnic populations in 
the U.S. are Hispanics and people of Asian origin. Currently, Hispanics represent about 
16 percent of the U.S. population, a number expected to triple by 2050, and Asians represent 
about 5 percent and are expected to represent more than 9 percent by 2050.24 Considering 
that minority groups now make up more than one-third of the U.S. population and will 
account for half within a generation, managers must learn to work effectively with diverse 
ethnic groups, cultures, and lifestyles to develop and retain a superior workforce for 
their company.
Diversity, blending individuals of different genders, ethnic backgrounds, cultures, 
religions, ages, and physical and mental abilities, can enhance a firm’s chances of suc-
cess. Some of the firms that made the top ten in a recent list of “Top 50 Companies 
for Diversity” were also leaders and innovators in their industries, including Johnson & 
Johnson (number one on the list), AT&T, the accounting firm Ernst & Young, Marriott 
International, and The Coca-Cola Company and IBM.25 Several studies have shown that 
diverse employee teams and workforces tend to perform tasks more effectively and develop 
better solutions to business problems than homogeneous employee groups. This result is 
due in part to the varied perspectives and experiences that foster innovation and creativity 
in multicultural teams.
Practical managers also know that attention to diversity issues can help them avoid dam-
aging legal battles. Losing a discrimination lawsuit can be very costly, yet in a recent survey, 
a majority of executives from racial and cultural minorities said they had seen discrimination 
in work assignments.26

Outsourcing and the Changing Nature of Work Not only is the U.S. 
workforce changing, but so is the very nature of work. Manufacturing used to account for 
most of U.S. annual output, but the balance has now shifted to services such as financial 
management and communications. This means firms must rely heavily on well-trained ser-
vice workers with knowledge, technical skills, the ability to communicate and deal with peo-
ple, and a talent for creative thinking. The Internet has made possible another business tool 
for staffing flexibility—outsourcing, using outside vendors to produce goods or fulfill ser-
vices and functions that were previously handled in-house. In the best situation, outsourcing 
allows a firm to reduce costs and concentrate its resources on the things it does best while 
gaining access to expertise it may not have. But outsourcing also creates its own challenges, 
such as differences in language or culture.
Offshoring is the relocation of business processes to lower-cost locations overseas. This 
can include both production and services. In recent years, China has emerged as a dominant 
location for production offshoring for many firms, while India has become the key player 
in offshoring services. Some U.S. companies are now structured so that entire divisions or 
functions are developed and staffed overseas—the jobs were never in the United States to 
start with. Another trend in some industries is nearshoring, outsourcing production or ser-
vices to nations near a firm’s home base.
Flexibility and Mobility Younger workers in particular are looking for some-
thing other than the work-comes-first lifestyle exemplified by the Baby Boom generation. 
But workers of all ages are exploring different work arrangements, such as telecommuting 
from remote locations and sharing jobs with two or more employees. Employers are also hir-
ing growing numbers of temporary and part-time employees, some of whom are less inter-
ested in advancing up the career ladder and more interested in using and developing their 
skills. While the cubicle-filled office will likely never become obsolete, technology makes 
productive networking and virtual team efforts possible by allowing people to work where 
they choose and easily share knowledge, a sense of purpose or mission, and a free flow of 
ideas across any geographical distance or time zone.
Managers of such far-flung workforces need to build and earn their trust, in order to 
retain valued employees and to ensure that all members are acting ethically and contributing 
their share without the day-to-day supervision of a more conventional work environment. 
These managers, and their employees, need to be flexible and responsive to change while 
work, technology, and the relationships between them continue to evolve.
Innovation through Collaboration Some observers also see a trend toward 
more collaborative work in the future, as opposed to individuals working alone. Businesses 
using teamwork hope to build a creative environment where all members contribute their 
knowledge and skills to solve problems or seize opportunities.
The old relationship between employers and employees was pretty simple: work-
ers arrived at a certain hour, did their jobs, and went home every day at the same time. 
Companies rarely laid off workers, and employees rarely left for a job at another firm. But all 
that—and more—has changed. Employees are no longer likely to remain with a single com-
pany throughout their entire careers and do not necessarily expect lifetime loyalty from the 
companies they work for. They do not expect to give that loyalty either. Instead, they build 
their own careers however and wherever they can. These changes mean that many firms now 
recognize the value of a partnership with employees that encourages creative thinking and 
problem solving and that rewards risk taking and innovation.

The 21st-Century Manager
Today’s companies look for managers who are intelligent, highly 
motivated people with the ability to create and sustain a vision of how 
an organization can succeed. The 21st-century manager must also 
apply critical-thinking skills and creativity to business challenges and 
lead change.
Importance of Vision
To thrive in the 21st century, businesspeople need vision, the abil-
ity to perceive marketplace needs and what an organization must do 
to satisfy them. David B. Snow Jr., chair and CEO of Medco Health 
Solutions, has been recognized by several pharmaceutical industry 
groups for his dedication to improving patient health and to shaping a 
future in which medical prescriptions can be tailored to the individual’s 
own genetic makeup. Medco serves more approximately 65 million 
workers, retirees, and seniors nationwide; employs more than 23,000 
people globally (3,000 of them pharmacists and 600 nurses); and 
operates a chain of specialty pharmacies, a diabetes-care company, and 
several international operations. During Snow’s tenure it has been named one of the most 
trustworthy U.S. companies (Forbes magazine) and one of the most admired in the world 
(Fortune) for its innovation and people management.27
Importance of Critical Thinking and Creativity
Critical thinking and creativity are essential characteristics of the 21st-century work-
force. Today’s businesspeople need to look at a wide variety of situations, draw connections 
between disparate information, and develop future-oriented solutions. This need applies not 
only to top executives, but to midlevel managers and entry-level workers as well.
Critical thinking is the ability to analyze and assess information to pinpoint 
problems or opportunities. The critical-thinking process includes activities such as 
determining the authenticity, accuracy, and worth of information, knowledge, and argu-
ments. It involves looking beneath the surface for deeper meaning and connections that can 
help identify critical issues and solutions. Without critical thinking, a firm may encounter 
serious problems.
Creativity is the capacity to develop novel solutions to perceived organizational prob-
lems. Although most people think of it in relation to writers, artists, musicians, and inven-
tors, that is a very limited definition. In business, creativity refers to the ability to see better 
and different ways of doing business. A computer engineer who solves a glitch in a software 
program is executing a creative act; so is a shipping clerk who finds a way to speed deliv-
ery of the company’s overnight packages. Sometimes a crisis calls for creative leadership. 
Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who famously guided US Airways Flight 1549 to a safe land-
ing in New York’s Hudson River, had to make immediate and critical decisions when both 
his engines quit after hitting birds upon take-off. His passengers’ and crew members’

lives—and lives on the ground—depended on his quick thinking and years of training. 
“Losing thrust on both engines, at low speed, at a low altitude, over one of the most densely 
populated areas on the planet. Yes, I knew it was a very challenging situation,” he said. 
Losing altitude, Sullenberger ruled out returning to La Guardia Airport or attempting to 
land at a nearby New Jersey airport, opting instead to splash down in the river close to a 
ferry terminal. “I needed to touch down with the wings exactly level . . . the nose slightly 
up . . . [and] just above our minimum flying speed, but not below it.” He accomplished those 
seemingly impossible feats and saved all 155 people on board.28
Some practice and mental exercise can cultivate your own ability to think creatively. 
Here are some exercises and guidelines:
 
• In a group, brainstorm by listing ideas as they come to mind. Build on other 
people’s ideas, but don’t criticize them. Wait until later to evaluate and organize 
the ideas.
 • Think about how to make familiar concepts unfamiliar. A glue that doesn’t stick very 
well? That’s the basis for 3M’s popular Post-it® notes.
 • Plan ways to rearrange your thinking with simple questions such as, “What features can 
we leave out?” or by imagining what it feels like to be the customer.
 • Cultivate curiosity, openness, risk, and energy as you meet people and encounter new 
situations. View these encounters as opportunities to learn.
 • Treat failures as additional opportunities to learn.
 • Get regular physical exercise. When you work out, your brain releases endorphins, and 
these chemicals stimulate creative thinking.
 • Pay attention to your dreams and daydreams. You might find that you already know the 
answer to a problem.
Creativity and critical thinking must go beyond generating new ideas, however. 
They must lead to action. In addition to creating an environment in which employees 
can nurture ideas, managers must give them opportunities to take risks and try new 
solutions.
Ability to Lead Change
Today’s business leaders must guide their employees and organizations through the 
changes brought about by technology, marketplace demands, and global competition. 
Managers must be skilled at recognizing employee strengths and motivating people to move 
toward common goals as members of a team. Throughout this book, real-world examples 
demonstrate how companies have initiated sweeping change initiatives. Most, if not all, have 
been led by managers comfortable with the tough decisions that today’s fluctuating condi-
tions require.
Factors that require organizational change can come from both external and internal 
sources; successful managers must be aware of both. External forces might include feedback 
from customers, developments in the international marketplace, economic trends, and new 
technologies. Internal factors might arise from new company goals, emerging employee 
needs, labor union demands, or production problems.

What Makes a Company Admired?
Who is your hero? Is it someone who has achieved great feats in sports, government, 
entertainment, or business? Why do you admire the person—does he or she run a company, 
earn a lot of money, or give back to the community and society? Every year, business maga-
zines and organizations publish lists of companies that they consider to be “most admired.” 
Companies, like individuals, may be admired for many reasons. Most people would mention 
solid profits, stable growth, a safe and challenging work environment, high-quality goods 
and services, and business ethics and social responsibility. Business ethics refers to the stan-
dards of conduct and moral values involving decisions made in the work environment. Social 
responsibility is a management philosophy that includes contributing resources to the com-
munity, preserving the natural environment, and developing or participating in nonprofit 
programs designed to promote the well-being of the general public. You’ll find business 
ethics and social responsibility examples throughout this book, as well as a deeper explora-
tion of these topics in Chapter 2. For businesses to behave ethically and responsibly, their 
employees need to have strong moral compasses that guide them. The “Solving an Ethical 
Controversy” feature debates the responsibility that watchdogs have when they fail to per-
form their duties.
As you read this text, you’ll be able to make up your mind about why companies 
should—or should not—be admired. Fortune publishes two lists of most-admired companies 
each year, one for U.S.-based firms and one for the world. The list is compiled from surveys 
and other research conducted by the Hay Group, a global human resources and organiza-
tional consulting firm. Criteria for making the list include innovation, people management, 
use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of management, and quality of products 
and services.29 Table 1.3 lists the top ten “Most Admired Companies” for a recent year.
What’s Ahead
As business speeds along in the 21st century, new technologies, population shifts, and 
shrinking global barriers are altering the world at a frantic pace. Businesspeople are catalysts 
for many of these changes, creating new opportunities for individuals who are prepared to 
take action. Studying contemporary business will help you prepare for the future.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was created by 
Congress in 1934 to protect investors by monitoring the securities 
industry. According to the SEC’s Web site, “The laws and rules that 
govern the securities industry in the United States derive from a simple 
and straightforward concept: all investors, whether large institutions or 
private individuals, should have access to certain basic facts about an 
investment prior to buying it, and so long as they hold it. To achieve 
this, the SEC requires public companies to disclose meaningful financial 
and other information to the public.”
Recently, however, a whopping $65 billion securities fraud came 
to light when the investment company run by Bernard Madoff turned 
out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time. Madoff used new 
investors’ funds to pay off the older ones. All the investment prof-
its Madoff claimed were an illusion. Independent investigator Harry 
Markopolos told Congress he had been warning the SEC about 
Madoff’s activities for years. “I gift-wrapped and delivered the larg-
est Ponzi scheme in history to them and somehow they couldn’t be 
bothered to conduct a thorough and proper investigation because they 
were too busy on matters of higher priority,” Markopolos testified. 
Thousands of individual and institutional investors faced financial ruin 
as Madoff’s scheme evaporated.
Does the SEC bear part of the blame for investor

Madoff pled guilty to charges of felony securities fraud and was sentenced to 150 years in prison. The SEC is conducting 
an internal investigation to discover why it failed to act on information about him that Markopolos and others provided over the 
years.

PRO
1. A $65 billion fraud could flourish only under a flawed regula-
tory system. “Our current fragmented regulatory system can allow bad 
actors to engage in misconduct outside the view and reach of some 
regulators,” said an officer of the securities industry’s watchdog organi-
zation. “It is undeniable that . . . the system failed to protect investors.”
2. “The SEC is . . . captive to the industry it regulates, and it is 
afraid of bringing big cases against the largest, most powerful firms,” 
said Markopolos. “Clearly the SEC was afraid of Mr. Madoff.”
CON
1. The SEC’s director of enforcement told a Senate committee, 
“We don’t turn a blind eye to fraud. If we see it and we suspect it, we 
pursue it. We don’t want fraudsters out there.”
2. The director also said the SEC doesn’t have enough resources to 
pursue all the tip-offs of potential fraud that come before it: “If we had 
more resources we could clearly do more.” Other regulators blamed 
lack of coordination among government agencies for the lapses in 
oversight that allowed Madoff to operate.

Summary of Learning Objectives
Distinguish between business and not-for-profit 
organizations.
Business consists of all profit-seeking activities that provide 
goods and services necessary to an economic system. Not-
for-profit organizations are business-like establishments 
whose primary objectives involve social, political, govern-
mental, educational, or similar functions—instead of profits.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 What activity lies at the heart of every business 
endeavor? At the heart of every business endeavor is an 
exchange between a buyer and a seller.
1.2 What are the primary objectives of a not-for-profit 
organization? Not-for-profit organizations place public 
service above profits, although they need to raise money in 
order to operate and achieve their social goals.
Identify and describe the factors of production.
The factors of production consist of four basic inputs: natu-
ral resources, capital, human resources, and entrepreneur-
ship. Natural resources include all productive inputs that are 
useful in their natural states. Capital includes technology, 
tools, information, and physical facilities. Human resources 
include anyone who works for the firm. Entrepreneurship is 
the willingness to take risks to create and operate a business.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 Identify the four basic inputs to an economic sys-
tem. The four basic inputs are natural resources, capital, 
human resources, and entrepreneurship.
2.2 List four types of capital. Four types of capital are 
technology, tools, information, and physical facilities.
Describe the private enterprise system, including basic 
rights and entrepreneurship.
The private enterprise system is an economic system that 
rewards firms for their ability to perceive and serve the 
needs and demands of consumers. Competition in the pri-
vate enterprise system ensures success for firms that satisfy 
consumer demands. Citizens in a private enterprise economy 
enjoy the rights to private property, profits, freedom of 
choice, and competition. Entrepreneurship drives economic 
growth.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 What is an alternative term for private enterprise 
system? Capitalism is an alternative word for private enter-
prise system.
3.2 What is the most basic freedom under the private 
enterprise system? The most basic freedom is the right to 
private property.
3.3 What is an entrepreneur? An entrepreneur is a risk 
taker who is willing to start, own, and operate a business.
Identify the six eras of business, and explain how the rela-
tionship era—including alliances, technology, and environ-
mental concerns—influences contemporary business.
The six historical eras are the Colonial period, the 
Industrial Revolution, the age of industrial entrepreneurs, 
the production era, the marketing era, and the relation-
ship era. In the Colonial period, businesses were small and 
rural, emphasizing agricultural production. The Industrial 
Revolution brought factories and mass production to busi-
ness. The age of industrial entrepreneurs built on the 
Industrial Revolution through an expansion in the number 
and size of firms. The production era focused on the growth 
of factory operations through assembly lines and other effi-
cient internal processes. During and following the Great 
Depression, businesses concentrated on finding markets for 
their products through advertising and selling, giving rise 
to the marketing era. In the relationship era, businesspeople 
focus on developing and sustaining long-term relationships 
with customers and other businesses. Technology promotes 
innovation and communication, while alliances create a 
competitive advantage through partnerships. Concern for 
the environment also helps build strong relationships with 
customers.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 What was the Industrial Revolution? The Industrial 
Revolution began around 1750 in England and moved 
business operations from an emphasis on independent, 
skilled workers to a factory system that mass-produced 
items.
4.2 During which era was the idea of branding devel-
oped? The idea of branding began in the marketing era.
4.3 What is the difference between transaction 
management and relationship management? 
Transaction management is an approach that focuses on 
building, promoting, and selling enough products to cover 
costs and earn profits. Relationship management is the 
collection of activities that build and maintain ongoing ties 
with customers and other parties.
Explain how today’s business workforce and the nature of 
work itself is changing.
The workforce is changing in several significant ways: (1) it 
is aging and the labor pool is shrinking, and (2) it is becom-
ing increasingly diverse. The nature of work has shifted 
toward services and a focus on information. More firms now 
rely on outsourcing, offshoring, and nearshoring to pro-
duce goods or fulfill services and functions that were previ-
ously handled in-house or in-country. In addition, today’s 
workplaces are becoming increasingly flexible, allowing 
employees to work from different locations and through dif-
ferent relationships. And companies are fostering innovation 
through teamwork and collaboration.

Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 Define outsourcing, offshoring, and nearshoring. 
Outsourcing involves using outside vendors to produce 
goods or fulfill services and functions that were once 
handled in-house. Offshoring is the relocation of business 
processes to lower-cost locations overseas. Nearshoring is 
the outsourcing of production or services to nations near a 
firm’s home base.
5.2 Describe the importance of collaboration and 
employee partnership. Businesses are increasingly focusing 
on collaboration, rather than on individuals working alone. 
No longer do employees just put in their time at a job they 
hold their entire career. The new employer–employee part-
nership encourages teamwork and creative thinking, prob-
lem solving, and innovation. Managers are trained to listen 
to and respect employees.
Identify the skills and attributes that managers need to 
lead businesses in the 21st century.
Today’s managers need vision, the ability to perceive market-
place needs and the way their firm can satisfy them. Critical-
thinking skills and creativity allow managers to pinpoint 
problems and opportunities and plan novel solutions. Finally, 
managers are dealing with rapid change, and they need skills 
to help lead their organizations through shifts in external 
and internal conditions.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 Why is vision an important managerial quality? 
Managerial vision allows a firm to innovate and adapt to 
meet changes in the marketplace.
6.2 What is the difference between creativity and 
critical thinking? Critical thinking is the ability to 
analyze and assess information to pinpoint problems or 
opportunities. Creativity is the capacity to develop 
novel solutions to perceived organizational 
problems.
Outline the characteristics that make a company 
admired by the business community.
A company is usually admired for its solid profits, stable 
growth, a safe and challenging work environment, high-
quality goods and services, and business ethics and social 
responsibility.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 Define business ethics and social responsibility. 
Business ethics refers to the standards of conduct and moral 
values involving decisions made in the work environment. 
Social responsibility is a management philosophy that 
includes contributing resources to the community, 
preserving the natural environment, and developing or 
participating in nonprofit programs designed to promote 
the well-being of the general public.
7.2 Identify three criteria used to judge whether a 
company might be considered admirable. Criteria in 
judging whether companies are admirable include three 
of the following: solid profits, stable growth, a safe 
and challenging work environment, high-quality 
goods and services, and business ethics and social 
responsibility.

Projects and Teamwork Applications
1. The entrepreneurial spirit fuels growth in the U.S. economy. 
Choose a company that interests you—one you have worked 
for or dealt with as a customer—and read about the com-
pany in the library or visit its Web site. Learn what you can 
about the company’s early history: Who founded it and why? 
Is the founder still with the organization? Do you think the 
founder’s original vision is still embraced by the company? If 
not, how has the vision changed?
2. Brands distinguish one company’s goods or services from its 
competitors. Each company you purchase from hopes that 
you will become loyal to its brand. Some well-known brands 
are Burger King, Coca-Cola, Hilton, and Old Navy. Choose 
a type of good or service you use regularly and identify the 
major brands associated with it. Are you loyal to a particular 
brand? Why or why not?
3. More and more businesses are forming strategic alliances 
to become more competitive. Sometimes, businesses pair 
up with not-for-profit organizations in a relationship that 
is beneficial to both. Choose a company whose goods or 
services interest you, such as Timberland, FedEx, General 
Mills, or Target. On your own or with a classmate, research 
the firm on the Internet to learn about its alliances with not-
for-profit organizations. Then describe one of the alliances, 
including goals and benefits to both parties. Create a presen-
tation for your class.
4. This chapter describes how the nature of the workforce is 
changing: the population is aging, the labor pool is shrink-
ing, the workforce is becoming more diverse, the nature of 
work is changing, the workplace is becoming more flexible 
and mobile, and employers are fostering innovation and 
collaboration among their employees. Form teams of two 
to three students. Select a company and research how that 
company is responding to changes in the workforce. When 
you have completed your research, be prepared to present 
it to your class. Choose one of the following companies 
or select your own: State Farm Insurance, Archer Daniels 
Midland, 3M, Marriott, or Dell.
5. Many successful companies today use technology to help 
them improve their relationship management. Suppose a 
major supermarket chain’s management team has asked you 
to assess its use of technology for this purpose. On your 
own or with a classmate, visit one or two local supermarkets 
and also explore their corporate Web sites. Note the ways 
in which firms in this industry already use technology to 
connect with their customers, and list at least three ideas 
for new ways or improvements to existing ones. Present 
your findings to the class as if they represented the man-
agement team.
Web Assignments
1. Using search engines. Gathering information is one of the 
most popular applications of the Web. Using two of the major 
search engines, such as Google and Bing, search the Web for 
information pertaining to brand and relationship management. 
Sort through your results—you’re likely to gets thousands of 
“hits”—and identify the three most useful. What did you learn 
from this experience regarding the use of a search engine?

CASE 1.2
Case 1.1
SAS Is Still a Great Place to Work
The employee benefits and perks at SAS, a pri-
vately held business software company in Raleigh, North 
Carolina, are so many and varied it boggles the imagina-
tion. The company’s 300-acre campus houses a gym, 
weight room, meditation garden, sauna, and Olympic-size 
swimming pool. It seems unlikely any of the complex’s 
4,200 employees would fall ill with such health-building 
options to choose from, but just in case, there’s a health-
care center with a staff of 56 including four doctors, ten 
nurses, physical therapists, and a psychologist. All care is 
free. “We charge you for one thing,” says the health ser-
vice director, “if you miss your appointment and don’t give 
us notice. That’s $10.”
Free or subsidized programs include Pilates, Zumba, 
yoga, weight management, smoking cessation, Wii 
bowling, massage, and aerobics. Two subsidized 
daycare centers care for 600 children, and there’s 
a summer camp. Job sharing, telecommuting, and 
domestic partner benefits for same-sex couples are 
offered. Employees can get their clothes dry cleaned, 
car detailed, and income tax return prepared while they 
work. They can eat in any of three subsidized cafete-
rias during the day (one has a piano player who takes 
requests) and grab take-out for the family at day’s end. 
They can prepare their own snacks in one of the many 
kitchens. But with free snacks every day, including Krispy 
Kremes (Fridays) and M&Ms (a long-standing Wednesday 
tradition), why would they?
Jim Goodnight, the company’s only CEO in its 34 
years, believes treating employees well is simply good 
business. Rather than thinking it’s unusual for SAS to be 
so generous, he wonders why other companies don’t fol-
low suit. And with revenues that have risen every year of 
the firm’s existence, recently topping $2.3 billion despite 
the global recession, it appears he’s right. SAS has been 
one of Fortune’s best companies to work for in each of the 
last 13 years and recently earned the number-one spot 
on the list. “Some may think that because SAS is family-
friendly and has great benefits we don’t work hard,” says 
a communications employee. “But people do work hard 
here, because they’re motivated to take care of a com-
pany that takes care of them.” That sentiment expresses 
the culture of trust Goodnight has worked to create. 
“What we don’t do is treat our employees like they’re all, 
you know, criminals,” says his vice president of human 
resources.
Employee turnover among the 11,000 SAS employees 
worldwide is 2 percent, well below the industry average, 
and the company receives about 100 résumés for every 
open position. (About half its employees work in the 
United States.) The typical employee works 35 hours per 
week and many make their own schedules; no one counts 
sick days. Average tenure is ten years.
About 17,000 customers worldwide use SAS data 
mining software, including IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, national 
retailers, banks, insurance and pharmaceutical firms, 
universities, the Census Bureau, and even professional 
baseball teams. Goodnight spends much of his time on 
the road meeting and talking with these clients, though he 
sometimes admits he would rather be programming. But 
he’s well aware of where the real value of the company 
lies, and that’s the reason he’s willing to spend so much 
on making SAS a great place to work. “My chief assets 
drive out the gate every day,” he says. “My job is to make 
sure they come back.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Explain how flexible and family-friendly policies 
have played a role in SAS’s success.
2. What kind of relationship does SAS seem to 
have with its employees? With its customers?

Among the many business projects launched 
by entrepreneur Paul English is a Web site called 
gethuman.com, designed to help frustrated consumers 
short-cut their way through large companies’ automated 
phone systems. English’s main job, however, is running 
a popular travel search engine he co-founded with Steve 
Hafner called Kayak.com, and in keeping with his fanatical 
focus on good customer service (just what those auto-
mated phone systems often don’t provide), he and Kayak’s 
engineers take regular turns personally responding to cus-
tomers’ e-mails and telephone calls. To those who say he 
could get the customer service job done for much less than 
an engineer’s salary, English says, “If you make the engi-
neers answer e-mails and phone calls from the custom-
ers, the second or third time they get the same question, 
they’ll actually stop what they’re doing and fix the code. 
Then we don’t have those questions any more.”
When English, who is also the company’s chief tech-
nology officer, takes the calls himself, he’s likely to give 
out his personal cell phone number and tell the caller, 
“If you have any follow-up questions, my name is Paul 
English; I’m the co-founder of the company.” Only a 
handful of people will call him back, he says, “but they’re 
blown away when I do that.”
Kayak’s staff of about 100 employees all talk, Twitter, 
or e-mail customers every day. Their work supports a Web 
site that lets millions of users compare prices for air travel, 
hotels, vacation deals, and rental cars. There are offices 
in Connecticut, where Hafner lives, Massachusetts, where 
English lives, and California, where the two bought a com-
peting firm in 2007, as well as local sites across Europe. 
Hafner and English phone or instant-message each other 
every day. “We can practically read each other’s minds,” 
says English. “If an issue comes up, I know how he’s 
going to weigh in and vice versa. We trust each other.” 
They also trust their engineers and encourage them to 
chime in with solutions to problems.
English, who has founded three other firms and sold 
one of them to Intuit several years ago, is an early riser 
who describes himself as having “more ideas than I can 
get done in a day.” After checking e-mail, practicing yoga, 
and taking his son to school, he arrives at work for a day 
that might start with meetings, including with nonprofits 
like Partners in Health or Village Health Works in which 
he plays an advisory role. “There are certain fundamental 
rights that I believe all people should have,” he says. 
“Kids shouldn’t be dying of drinking dirty water.” English 
likes to leave half his day free of scheduled appointments 
and spend the time walking around the office’s open-plan 
environment to “see what’s going on and work on prod-
uct issues and design strategy.”
Acknowledging the company’s growing success, and 
mindful that it needed more sophisticated marketing to 
keep it in the forefront of travel customers’ minds, 
Kayak recently launched a national advertising campaign, 
which the cofounders took an active part in shaping. 
With a new logo and the tagline, “Search one and done,” 
Kayak.com hopes to make more people aware that, as 
their ad agency’s founder says, “it doesn’t make sense to 
start their travel search anywhere else.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How does Paul English typify an entrepreneur? 
In what ways do you think his experience, 
background, or attitudes are unusual for an 
entrepreneur?
2. How well do you think Kayak.com manages its 
relationships with its users? If it grows consider-
ably larger over the next few years, how do you 
think this may change that relationship?

New Harvest Coffee Roasters Brews Up Fresh 
Business
CASE 1.3
Case 1.3
If you’re one of those people for whom the scent of 
freshly roasted coffee is irresistible, you have something in 
common with RikKleinfeldt. Kleinfeldt, the co-founder and 
president of New Harvest Coffee Roasters, is a self-pro-
claimed coffee fanatic. He dwells on the aroma and flavor of 
coffee. He measures the freshness of roasted coffee in hours 
and days, instead of weeks and months. Kleinfeldt started 
New Harvest Coffee Roasters ten years ago as a way to pay 
homage to fresh coffee and build a business around it.
Kleinfeldt observes Starbucks’ tremendous success at cre-
ating gathering places for people to enjoy coffee and tea—as 
well as baked goods—in a relaxed social atmosphere. But 
he also notes with humor that, although cafes and coffee 
bars were thriving a decade ago, these popular hang-outs 
“weren’t really about coffee. They were about smoothies and 
cookies. I thought, maybe it’s time to get back to basics and 
roast some coffee.” Kleinfeldt recalls that friends and col-
leagues—fellow coffee fans—felt the same way. He believed 
that he had a basis to start a business. “We’re coffee peo-
ple,” he explains. “There is a like-minded group of people.”
Kleinfeldt also points out that the movement toward 
locally grown or produced foods has been a big help in 
establishing and building support for his business. “The idea 
of local coffee starts with the local roaster,” he explains. 
Although the coffee beans themselves are grown else-
where—mostly on farms in Costa Rica—they are roasted at 
New Harvest’s facility in Rhode Island, where the company 
is based. “Freshness is a huge factor” in a good cup of cof-
fee, says Kleinfeldt. “Once it’s roasted, it’s good for about 
two to twelve days, which is a good incentive to buy local.”
Buying local is exactly what retailers and coffee 
shops like Blue State Coffee do, creating a collaborative 
relationship with New Harvest. Alex Payson, COO of Blue 
State Coffee—a thriving shop in Rhode Island—observes 
that most of his customers live within a five or ten-minute 
walk from his business. Blue State customers are educated 
about the coffee they drink. “They want to know,” says 
Payson smiling. “We connect with our coffee farmers. Our 
customers ask about the story behind our coffee,” includ-
ing farming practices and working conditions. Payson and 
his colleagues from New Harvest have traveled together 
to some of the coffee farms in Costa Rica that grow the 
beans they purchase. In fact, loyal customers can view the 
progress of trips like this on New Harvest’s Facebook page.
Relationships with companies like Blue State Coffee 
as well as with consumers are the basis for New Harvest’s 
growth as a business. “We need strategic alliances,” says 
RikKleinfeldt. “Blue State is a great example of that. “They 
buy into what we’re doing and we support what they are 
doing. They collaborate with us—what’s good for Blue 
State is also good for New Harvest.” Blue State educates its 
customers and employees about the benefits of buying from 
a local firm like New Harvest, which in turn works with 
certified organic, free trade growers. When Blue State’s 
workers are able to discuss their products knowledgeably 
with customers—including where and how they are grown, 
harvested and roasted—a relationship is developed.
Sharing activities, comments, news, and anecdotes 
with customers, retailers, and coffee shops through social 
media such as Facebook and Twitter allows New Harvest 
to broaden its base without spending more dollars on mar-
keting and advertising. These connections also put a per-
sonal face on the company and allow New Harvest to gain 
important knowledge about the views and preferences of 
its customers. In addition, they provide valuable opportuni-
ties to showcase some of the company’s work in the com-
munity as well as its support for organizations such as the 
Rainforest Alliance and New England GreenStart.
“Our mission is to be the leader in our region in 
developing the palate and expectations of coffee drinkers, 
in order to create a permanent market for the coffee pro-
duced by passionate and skilled growers,” states the New 
Harvest Web site. For RikKleinfeldt’s company and custom-
ers, coffee is much more than a hot cup of joe in the morn-
ing. Coffee—organically grown, freshly roasted, and served 
locally—represents a sustainable way to do business.

 Larry’s Beans Roasts a 
Greener Cup of Coffee
 I    n the aftermath of the recent recession, small 
businesses—which account for almost 97 percent of 
all businesses across America—have been looking 
for ways to reduce their expenses, sometimes simply 
in order to survive. Many are finding that cutting 
their energy consumption not only lowers costs but 
is also good for the environment. Some are finding 
that environmentally sound management practices 
and production methods save money, too.
Having fallen in love with coffee while studying 
economics in Seattle, Larry Larson founded Larry’s 
Beans, in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1994. (Kevin 
Bobal, the co-owner, joined later.) With just 16 
employees, Larry’s Beans is dedicated to roasting 
“ridiculously small” batches of beans for maximum 
flavor. All the coffees are 100 percent shade grown 
and organic or transitional organic.
Larry’s original goal was simple: he “just wanted 
better coffee.” His quest took him to coffee-growing 
regions around the world, where he got to know 
individual farmers and saw their farms for himself. 
He came to the conclusion that environmentally 
sound growing methods, which nourish the soil and 
protect the rain forests, were crucial to growing 
better beans.
The quality of the beans is not the only contributing 
factor to Larry’s success. The company is also 
dedicated to the idea that energy conservation 
and sustainability are key to maintaining a good 
working environment—and for turning out a high-
quality finished product. The plant is a mix of new 
and second-hand elements, including reclaimed 
wood. Even Larry and Kevin’s desks were bought 
at the local Habitat for Humanity resale store. The 
coffee-roasting facility itself is illuminated entirely 
by 400 square feet (37 square meters) of skylights 
for daytime lighting. Other lighting is supplied by 
low-wattage fluorescent bulbs. Solar-powered hot-
water collectors provide heating. The plant has 
taken advantage of a recent city ordinance and 
collects rainwater to operate the low-flush toilets. 
The recently renovated warehouses have walls 
that are insulated with nontoxic spray foam made 
without formaldehyde or chlorofluorocarbons. The 
roofs and warehouse siding are made of silver-white 
metal alloy panels whose thermal reflectivity lowers 
heating and cooling expenses. Heaters mounted 
in the ceiling are intended to warm only the area 
immediately beneath them and can be turned on or 
off as workers enter or leave the area. The summer 
heat is mitigated by two insulated garage doors 
that can be opened to let in the cool morning air. 
Employees can also move to secondary work stations 
in cooler parts of the building. A casual dress code 
permits shorts and T-shirts for additional comfort.
Larry’s has recently developed biodegradable bags 
that take only about nine months to break down—
although the company encourages customers to 
reuse them.
The company’s two delivery trucks run on recycled 
waste vegetable oil collected from local restaurants. 
In fact, Larry’s operates the only biodiesel fuel pump 
in Raleigh.
In addition to cultivating environmentally sound 
business practices in the office, Larry’s Beans has 
become involved in community causes ranging from 
local water conservation and pet adoptions to Coffee 
Kids, whose aim is to improve the quality of life of 
children in coffee-growing regions.
When planning their renovations, Larry and Kevin 
encountered difficulties in finding contractors that 
met their standards of low costs, low or green 
technology, and use of reclaimed materials wherever 
possible. But they didn’t give up. Larry says, “Don’t 
let people tell you you can’t do something. If a 
contractor says it is going to cost a million dollars, 
you’re talking to the wrong guy. Just get started, 
and you’ll find that the more you do, the more you 
will want to do.”1

Overview
2
Larry’s Beans’s efforts to create sustain-
able operations are not unique in the world 
of business—they just occur on a smaller 
scale than those of many other firms. Many 
companies are concerned about the environ-
ment and their societies. Sometimes that 
means growing more slowly than they might 
or reducing short-term profits for longer, 
sustained benefits. In the case of Larry’s 
Beans, it means not only changing its own 
operations to help the environment but also 
persuading consumers that “greener” coffee 
is better for the environment, too.
Although most organizations strive to 
combine ethical behavior with profitable 
operation, some have struggled to overcome 
major ethical lapses in recent years. Ethical 
failures in a number of large or well-known 
firms led to lawsuits, indictments, and 
judgments against firms. The image of 
the CEO—and of business in general—
suffered as the evening news carried reports 
of executives pocketing millions of dollars 
in compensation while their companies 
floundered.
But sometimes bad news is a prelude 
to good news. In the wake of such stories, 
both the government and companies have 
renewed their efforts to conduct themselves 
in an ethical manner and one that reflects a 
responsibility to society, to consumers, and 
to the environment. In 2004 the Federal 
Sentencing Commission strengthened its 
guidelines for ethics compliance programs, 
and more and more firms began to pay 
attention to formulating more explicit stan-
dards and procedures for ethical behavior. 
Companies also began to recognize the 
enormous impact of setting a good example 
rather than a bad one. Today you are likely 
to hear about the goodwill that companies 
such as Target Corporation, Ford Motor 
Company, and Starbucks generate when 
they give back to their communities through 
youth reading programs, undertake recycling 
or energy-conservation programs, or seek to 
pay fair prices to suppliers.
As we discussed in Chapter 1, the under-
lying aim of business is to serve customers 
at a profit. But most companies today try 
to do more than that, looking for ways to 
give back to customers, society, and the 
environment. Sometimes they face difficult 
questions in the process. When does a com-
pany’s self-interest conflict with society’s and 
customers’ well-being? And must the goal of 
seeking profits conflict with upholding high 
principles of right and wrong? In response 
to the second question, a growing number of 
businesses of all sizes are answering no.
Concern for Ethical 
and Societal Issues
An organization that wants to prosper over the long term is well advised to consider 
business ethics, the standards of conduct and moral values governing actions and deci-
sions in the work environment. Businesses also must take into account a wide range of social 
issues, including how a decision will affect the environment, employees, and customers. 
These issues are at the heart of social responsibility, whose primary objective is the 
business ethics 
Standards of conduct and 
moral values regarding 
right and wrong actions in 
the work environment.

Chapter 2  Business Ethics and Social Responsibility

enhancement of society’s welfare through philosophies, policies, procedures, and actions. In 
short, businesses must find the delicate balance between doing what is right and doing what 
is profitable. In 2010, General Motors announced that it would begin full-scale production 
of the fully electric plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt. The Volt will run for 40 miles after its 
battery pack is charged at an ordinary household outlet. After that, an internal-combustion 
engine takes over—to generate electricity to power the car farther. Planning to offer the car 
in limited markets at first, GM hopes to woo buyers with the prospect of owning a car that 
can achieve an astonishing 150 miles per gallon of liquid fuel.2
In business, as in life, deciding what is right or wrong in a given situation does not 
always involve a clear-cut choice. Firms have many responsibilities—to customers, to 
employees, to investors, and to society as a whole. Sometimes conflicts arise in trying to 
serve the different needs of these separate constituencies. The ethical values of executives 
and individual employees at all levels can influence the decisions and actions a business takes. 
Throughout your own career, you will encounter many situations in which you will need to 
weigh right and wrong before making a decision or taking action. So we begin our discussion 
of business ethics by focusing on individual ethics.
Business ethics are also shaped by the ethical climate within an organization. Codes 
of conduct and ethical standards play increasingly significant roles in businesses in which 
doing the right thing is both supported and applauded. This chapter demonstrates how a 
firm can create a framework to encourage—and even demand—high standards of ethical 
behavior and social responsibility from its employees. The chapter also considers the com-
plex question of what business owes to society and how societal forces mold the actions of 
businesses. Finally, it examines the influence of business ethics and social responsibility on 
global business.

The Contemporary 
Ethical Environment
Business ethics are now in the spotlight as never before. Companies realize that they 
have to work harder to earn the trust of the general public, and many have taken on the 
challenge as if their very survival depends on it. This movement toward corporate social respon-
sibility should benefit all—consumers, the environment, and the companies themselves.
Most business owners and managers have built and maintained enduring companies 
without breaking the rules. One example of a firm with a longstanding commitment to 
ethical practice is Johnson & Johnson, the giant multinational manufacturer of healthcare 
products. The most admired pharmaceutical maker and the ninth-most-admired company 
in the world, according to Fortune, Johnson & Johnson has abided by the same basic code of 
ethics, its well-known Credo, for more than 50 years. The Credo, reproduced in Figure 2.1, 
remains the ethical standard against which the company’s employees periodically evaluate 
how well their firm is performing. Management is 
pledged to address any lapses that are reported.3
Many companies are conscious of how ethical 
standards can translate into concern for the environ-
ment. In the fall of 2009, Walmart announced a plan 
to pursue three sustainability goals:
1. to use only renewable energy sources
2. to recycle all of its waste
3.  to sell products that “sustain people and the envi-
ronment,” according to Matt Kistler, the company’s 
senior vice president for sustainability.
That summer, the company conducted a survey 
of its suppliers on their sustainability practices as a 
first step in developing a “sustainability index” to 
help its customers assess the impact—on the envi-
ronment and on society—of products in its stores. In 
addition, so far 40 Walmart stores make use of pho-
tovoltaic cells that generate electricity directly from 
sunlight.4
Although not all companies set and meet 
high ethical standards, the ethical climate seems 
to be improving despite the recent recession. The 
National Business Ethics Survey, conducted by the 
Ethics Resource Center, found that 49 percent of 
employees surveyed “witnessed misconduct on the 
job” in 2009, down from 56 percent in 2007. More 
employees said they reported misconduct when they 
saw it, up to 63 percent in 2009 from 58 percent in 
2007. However, about one-quarter of employees said 
that the recession had had a negative impact on their

Our Credo 
We believe our ﬁrst responsibility is to the doctors, nurses and patients, to 
mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services. In 
meeting their needs everything we do must be of high quality. We must 
constantly strive to reduce our costs in order to maintain reasonable prices. 
Customers’ orders must be serviced promptly and accurately. Our suppliers 
and distributors must have an opportunity to make a fair proﬁt. 
We are responsible to our employees, the men and women who work with us 
throughout the world. Everyone must be considered as an individual. We 
must respect their dignity and recognize their merit. They must have a sense 
of security in their jobs. Compensation must be fair and adequate, and 
working conditions clean, orderly and safe. We must be mindful of ways to 
help our employees fulﬁll their family responsibilities. Employees must feel 
free to make suggestions and complaints. There must be equal opportunity 
for employment, development and advancement for those qualiﬁed. We 
must provide competent management,
and their actions must be just and ethical.
We are responsible to the communities in which we live and work and to the 
world community as well. We must be good citizens—support good works 
and charities and bear our fair share of taxes. We must encourage civic 
improvements and better health and education. We must maintain in good 
order the property we are privileged to use, protecting the environment and 
natural resources.
Our ﬁnal responsibility is to our stockholders. Business must make a sound 
proﬁt. We must experiment with new ideas. Research must be carried on, 
innovative programs developed and mistakes paid for. New equipment must 
be purchased, new facilities provided and new products launched. Reserves 
must be created to provide for adverse times. When we operate according to 
these principles, the stockholders should realize a fair return.

company’s ethics culture. In such cases, misconduct rose 16 points. About 10 percent said 
their company had lowered its ethical standards in order to survive the recession.5
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 established new rules and regulations for securities 
trading and accounting practices. Companies are now required to publish their code of ethics, 
if they have one, and inform the public of any changes made to it. The law may actually 
motivate even more firms to develop written codes and guidelines for ethical business behavior. 
The federal government also created the U.S. Sentencing Commission to institutionalize 
ethics compliance programs that would establish high ethical standards and end corporate 
misconduct. The requirements for such programs are shown in Table 2.1.
The current ethical environment of business also includes the appointment of new corporate 
officers specifically charged with deterring wrongdoing and ensuring that ethical standards are 
met. Ethics compliance officers, whose numbers are rapidly rising, are responsible for conducting 
employee training programs that help spot potential fraud and abuse within the firm, investigat-
ing sexual harassment and discrimination charges, and monitoring any potential conflicts of inter-
est. But practicing corporate social responsibility is more than just monitoring behavior. Many 
companies now adopt a three-pronged approach to ethics and social responsibility:
1. engaging in traditional corporate philanthropy, which involves giving to worthy causes
2. anticipating and managing risks
3. identifying opportunities to create value by doing the right thing.6

Individuals Make a Difference
In today’s business environment, individuals can make the difference in ethical expecta-
tions and behavior. As executives, managers, and employees demonstrate their personal 
ethical principles—or lack of ethical principles—the expectations and actions of those who 
work for and with them can change.
What is the current status of individual business ethics in the United States? Although 
ethical behavior can be difficult to track or define in all circumstances, evidence suggests that 
unfortunately some individuals act unethically or illegally on the job. The National Business 
Ethics Survey identifies such behaviors as putting one’s own interests ahead of the organiza-
tion, lying to employees, misreporting hours worked, Internet abuse, and safety violations, 
among others.7
Technology seems to have expanded the range and impact of unethical behavior. For 
example, anyone with computer access to data has the potential to steal or manipulate the 
data or to shut down the system, even from a remote location. Recently Radisson Hotels 
alerted customers that their credit-card security system had experienced a data breach in 
some U.S.-based and Canadian hotels. The cost of dealing with a data breach can total up to 
$6.6 million per incident.8 While some might shrug these occurrences away, in fact they have 
an impact on how investors, customers, and the general public view a firm. It is difficult to 
rebuild a tarnished image, and long-term customers may be lost.
Nearly every employee, at every level, wrestles with ethical questions at some point or 
another. Some rationalize questionable behavior by saying, “Everybody’s doing it.” Others 
act unethically because they feel pressured in their jobs or have to meet performance quotas. 
Yet some avoid unethical acts that don’t mesh with their personal values and morals. To help 
you understand the differences in the ways individuals arrive at ethical choices, the next sec-
tion focuses on how personal ethics and morals develop.
Development of Individual Ethics
Individuals typically develop ethical standards in the three stages shown in 
Figure 2.2: the preconventional, conventional, and postconventional stages. In 
stage 1, the preconventional stage, individuals primarily consider their own needs 
and desires in making decisions. They obey external rules only because they are 
afraid of punishment or hope to receive rewards if they comply.
In stage 2, the conventional stage, individuals are aware of and act in response 
to their duty to others, including their obligations to their family members, 
coworkers, and organizations. The expectations of these groups influence how 
they choose between what is acceptable and unacceptable in certain situations. 
Self-interest, however, continues to play a role in decisions.
Stage 3, the postconventional stage, represents the highest level of ethical and 
moral behavior. The individual is able to move beyond mere self-interest and duty 
and take the larger needs of society into account as well. He or she has developed 
personal ethical principles for determining what is right and can apply those prin-
ciples in a wide variety of situations. One issue that you may face at work is an 
ethically compromised or “sticky” situation; the “Business Etiquette” feature lists 
some tips to consider in deciding how to handle such a dilemma.
An individual’s stage in moral and ethical development is determined by a 
huge number of factors. Experiences help shape responses to different situations. 
Stage 3: Postconventional
Individual follows personal
principles for resolving ethical
dilemmas. He or she considers
personal, group, and societal
interests.
Stage 2: Conventional
Individual considers the interests
and expectations of others in
making decisions. Rules are
followed because it is a part of
belonging to the group.
Stage 1: Preconventional
Individual is mainly looking out
for his or her own interests. Rules
are followed only out of fear of
punishment or hope of reward.

A person’s family, educational, cultural, and 
religious backgrounds can also play a role, as 
can the environment within the firm. Individuals 
can also have different styles of deciding ethical 
dilemmas, no matter what their stage of moral 
development.
To help you understand and prepare for 
the ethical dilemmas you may confront in your 
career, let’s take a closer look at some of the 
factors involved in solving ethical questions 
on the job.
On-the-Job Ethical Dilemmas
In the fast-paced world of business, you 
will sometimes be called on to weigh the ethics 
of decisions that can affect not just your own 
future but possibly the futures of your fellow 
workers, your company, and its customers. As 
already noted, it’s not always easy to distinguish 
between what is right and wrong in many business 
situations, especially when the needs and concerns 
of various parties conflict. In the recent past, 
some CEOs (or their companies) who were 
accused of wrongdoing simply claimed that they 
had no idea crimes were being committed, but 
today’s top executives are making a greater effort 
to be informed of all activities taking place in 
their firms.
Many clothing retailers donate unworn, 
unsold garments to charities such as clothing 
banks. In January 2010, a graduate student dis-
covered that the H&M store on New York’s 34th 
Street was destroying unsold clothing instead. 
When she contacted store officials and then the 
company’s headquarters in Sweden, her requests 
for information and offers of help to put H&M in 
contact with aid organizations went unanswered. 
She then contacted The New York Times, which 
published a story detailing how H&M—among 
other retailers—routinely mutilated unsold gar-
ments before discarding them to render them 
unsalable by street vendors or other black-market 
sellers. The New York City Clothing Bank, 
founded by the city’s mayor during the 1980s, 
accepts unsold garments and slightly defaces 
them—not to destroy them but to protect retail-
ers by negating the garments’ street value. When 
How to Handle Ethical Dilemmas at Work
How Can Business Support an Ethical Environment?
“Doing well begins with doing right,” according to Sharon Allen, Deloitte 
LLP’s chairman of the board. Her advice to companies in the current economy 
is to concentrate on ethics and by encouraging employees to work to high 
ethical standards, the organization will end up with strong performers.
Unethical behavior in the workplace can lead to lost earnings and dam-
aged personal lives. In a recent survey the Association of Certiﬁ ed Fraud 
Examiners discovered that U.S. companies lose approximately 7 percent of 
their annual revenues to fraud. On the reverse side, companies that were 
deemed highly ethical on Ethisphere’s list saw increased growth.
Employees are eager to work for those companies that demonstrate 
good corporate social responsibility and high standards for ethical business 
conduct and customers put more trust into those organizations as well. To 
ensure the good ethical conduct for both employees and customers, compa-
nies should have ethical leaders, a code of ethics or similar policies, and ethics 
training for employees.
What Can You Do about an Ethical Dilemma?
The business journalist Suzy Welch claims that ethical dilemmas are difﬁ cult 
to resolve because we tend to jump to conclusions based on insufﬁ cient infor-
mation. Welch suggests the following steps if you suspect unethical behavior 
in the ofﬁ ce:
1 
Get all the facts. Ask tactful questions of people you know are 
trustworthy—not sources of rumors or gossip. In return, beware of 
revealing anything told to you in conﬁ dence. Talk to your company’s 
human resources department. Be investigative, not aggressive.
2 
When you have the facts, ask yourself, Is this really a moral dilemma? Or 
is it a case of ofﬁ ce politics? What may look like an ethical problem could 
be a power play in disguise.
3 
If the situation really is an ethical dilemma, explain the issue to a trusted 
friend outside the company—and outside your family. That person may 
be able to take an unbiased view and advise you about what to do next.

the story was published, H&M promised that it would stop destroying 
unsold clothing and instead donate the garments to charity. A company 
spokeswoman in New York declared, “It will not happen again. We 
are committed 100 percent to make sure this practice is not happening 
anywhere else, as it is not our standard practice.”9
Businesses may sometimes refuse to purchase goods or services 
from a particular country because of civil rights abuses by the govern-
ment of that country. Some of the world’s largest and most prestigious 
jewelers, including Cartier and Tiffany & Co., announced that they 
would not purchase rubies and other gems from Myanmar (formerly 
Burma) because of the government’s crackdown on protests by stu-
dents and monks, as well as other civil rights violations. In addition, 
the United States and the European Union agreed to ban the import 
of gems from Myanmar.10
Solving ethical dilemmas is not easy. In many cases, each possible 
decision can have both unpleasant consequences and positive benefits 
that must be evaluated. The ethical issues that confront manufacturers 
with unsold merchandise are just one example of many different types 
of ethical questions encountered in the workplace. Figure 2.3 identi-
fies four of the most common ethical challenges that businesspeople face: conflict of interest, 
honesty and integrity, loyalty versus truth, and whistle-blowing.
Conflict of Interest A conflict of interest occurs when a businessperson is faced 
with a situation in which an action benefiting one person or group has the potential to harm 
another. Conflicts of interest may pose ethical challenges when they involve the businessper-
son’s own interests and those of someone to whom he or she has a duty or when they involve 
two parties to whom the businessperson has a duty. Lawyers, business consultants, or advertis-
ing agencies would face a conflict of interest if they represented two competing companies: 
a strategy that would most benefit one of the client companies might harm the other client. 
Similarly, a real estate agent would face an ethical conflict by representing both the buyer and 
seller in a transaction. Handling the situation responsibly would be possible, but it would also 
be difficult. A conflict may also exist between someone’s personal interests and those of an 
organization or its customers. An offer of gifts or bribes for special treatment creates a situa-
tion in which the buyer, but not necessarily the company, may benefit personally.
A conflict of interest may also occur when one person holds two or more similar jobs 
in two different workplaces. Ethical ways to handle conflicts of interest include (1) avoiding 
them and (2) disclosing them. Some companies have policies against taking on clients who 
are competitors of existing clients. Most businesses and government agencies have written 
policies prohibiting employees from accepting gifts or specifying a maximum gift value. Or 
a member of a board of directors or committee might abstain from voting on a decision in 
which he or she has a personal interest. In other situations, people state their potential con-
flict of interest so that the people affected can decide whether to get information or help 
they need from another source instead.
Honesty and Integrity Employers highly value honesty and integrity. An 
employee who is honest can be counted on to tell the truth. An employee with integrity 
goes beyond truthfulness. Having integrity means adhering to deeply felt ethical principles 
in business situations. It includes doing what you say you will do and accepting responsibility

for mistakes. Behaving with honesty and integrity 
inspires trust, and as a result, it can help build long-
term relationships with customers, employers, sup-
pliers, and the public. Employees, in turn, want their 
managers and the company as a whole to treat them 
honestly and with integrity.
Unfortunately, violations of honesty and integrity 
are all too common. Some people misrepresent their 
academic credentials and previous work experience on 
their résumés or job applications. Although it may seem 
tempting to embellish a résumé in a competitive job 
market, the act shows a lack of honesty and integrity—
and eventually it will catch up with you. A recent news 
report details a city worker in Ohio, who after years of 
listing a bachelor’s degree on her résumé had to admit 
that she only attended the school for six months and 
never graduated. She stepped down from her position.11
Others steal from their employers by taking home 
supplies or products without permission or by carrying 
out personal business during the time they are being 
paid to work. For example, Internet misuse during the 
work day is increasing. Employees use the Internet during work hours for personal e-mail, 
shopping, gaming, and visiting bulletin boards and blogs or social networking sites such as 
Facebook and YouTube. The use of laptops, cell phones, and other wireless devices makes 
all of this misconduct easier to hide.12 While the occurrence of such activity varies widely—
and employers may feel more strongly about cracking down on some activities than others—
most agree that Internet misuse is a problem. Some have resorted to electronic monitoring 
and surveillance. Compliance with laws regarding the privacy and security of client informa-
tion is another major reason given for the continuing increase in such monitoring.
Loyalty versus Truth Businesspeople expect their employees to be loyal and to 
act in the best interests of the company. But when the truth about a company is not favor-
able, an ethical conflict can arise. Individuals may have to decide between loyalty to the 
company and truthfulness in business relationships. People resolve such dilemmas in various 
ways. Some place the highest value on loyalty, even at the expense of truth. Others avoid 
volunteering negative information but answer truthfully if someone asks them a specific 
question. People may emphasize truthfulness and actively disclose negative information, 
especially if the cost of silence is high, as in the case of operating a malfunctioning aircraft or 
selling tainted food items.
Whistle-Blowing When an individual encounters unethical or illegal actions at 
work, that person must decide what action to take. Sometimes it is possible to resolve the 
problem by working through channels within the organization. If that fails, the person 
should weigh the potential damages to the greater public good. If the damage is significant, 
a person may conclude that the only solution is to blow the whistle. Whistle-blowing is an 
employee’s disclosure to company officials, government authorities, or the media of illegal, 
immoral, or unethical practices.
A whistle-blower must weigh a number of issues in deciding whether to come forward.

higher-level managers cooperate. A company that values ethics will try to correct a problem, 
and staying at a company that does not value ethics may not be worthwhile. In some cases, 
however, people resort to whistle-blowing because they believe the unethical behavior is 
causing significant damage that outweighs the risk that the company will retaliate against 
the whistle-blower. Those risks have been real in some cases. State and federal laws protect 
whistle-blowers in certain situations, such as reports of discrimination, and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 now requires that firms in the private sector provide procedures for 
anonymous reporting of accusations of fraud. Under the act, anyone who retaliates against 
an employee for taking concerns of unlawful conduct to a public official can be prosecuted. 
In addition, whistle-blowers can seek protection under the False Claims Act, a law that was 
passed in the 1800s, under which they can file a lawsuit on behalf of the government if they 
believe that a company has somehow defrauded the government. Charges against healthcare 
companies for fraudulent billing for Medicare or Medicaid are examples of this type of law-
suit. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009—also known as the “stimulus 
package”—grants protection to other whistle-blowers. If an employee of a nonfederal orga-
nization (including state or local government) believes that organization has misused funds 
it received under the stimulus package, he or she will be protected against retaliation after 
reporting this information.13
Despite these protections, whistle-blowing still has its risks. For several years, George 
Green worked as an architect in Texas. He discovered activities of fraud on state construc-
tion projects including kickbacks and other gifts from contractors to supervisors in return 
for ignoring noncompliance issues. When Green reported the alleged illegal activities, he 
was instead investigated for abusing his sick days and making long-distance phone calls, 
and was subsequently fired. In order to clear his name, he filed a lawsuit under the Texas 
Whistleblower Act. Green won his lawsuit and was awarded $13.7 million in compensatory 
and punitive damages. Instead of collecting his judgment, the Texas Legislature refused 
to pay. Green lost everything—his job, his fiancée, and his home. “I lived all my life with 
what I thought was decency and courtesy, always respecting and deferring to authority,” 
George Green says, “. . . I had truth on my side and lost. I lost everything but 
my self-respect.”14
Obviously, whistle-blowing and other ethical issues arise relatively infrequently in 
firms with strong organizational climates of ethical behavior. The next section examines 
how a business can develop an environment that discourages unethical behavior 
among individuals.
How Organizations 
Shape Ethical Conduct
No individual makes decisions in a vacuum. Choices are strongly influenced by the stan-
dards of conduct established within the organizations where people work. Most ethical lapses 
in business reflect the values of the firms’ corporate cultures.
As shown in Figure 2.4, development of a corporate culture to support business ethics 
happens on four levels:
1. ethical awareness
2. ethical reasoning

3. ethical action
4. ethical leadership.
If any of these four factors is missing, the ethical climate 
in an organization will weaken.
Ethical Awareness
The foundation of an ethical climate is ethical awareness. 
As we have already seen, ethical dilemmas occur frequently in 
the workplace. So employees need help in identifying ethical 
problems when they occur. Workers also need guidance about 
how the firm expects them to respond.
One way for a firm to provide this support is to develop 
a code of conduct, a formal statement that defines how the 
organization expects employees to resolve ethical questions. 
Johnson & Johnson’s Credo, presented earlier, is such a code. At the most basic level, a code 
of conduct may simply specify ground rules for acceptable behavior, such as identifying the 
laws and regulations that employees must obey. Other companies use their codes of conduct 
to identify key corporate values and provide frameworks that guide employees as they resolve 
moral and ethical dilemmas.
The aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, and with 
branch offices around the world, has issued a code of conduct to define its values and help 
employees put them into practice. The code of conduct emphasizes “maintaining a culture 
of integrity” and defines three basic core values: “do what’s right; respect others; perform 
with excellence.” The code applies to “all Lockheed Martin employees, members of the 
Board of Directors, agents, consultants, contract labor or others, when they are represent-
ing or acting for the corporation.” All employees at every level are expected to treat fellow 
employees, suppliers, and customers with dignity and respect and to comply with environ-
mental, health, and safety regulations. The code reminds leaders that their language and 
behavior must not put or even seem to put pressure on subordinates that might induce 
them to perform in a way that is contrary to the standards set forth in the code. The code 
also outlines procedures for reporting violations to a local company ethics officer, prom-
ising confidentiality and nonretaliation for problems reported in good faith. Lockheed 
Martin issues a copy of this code of conduct to each employee and also posts it (in more 
than 20 languages) on its Web site.15
Other firms incorporate similar codes in their policy manuals or mission statements; 
some issue a code of conduct or statement of values in the form of a small card that 
employees and managers can carry with them. Harley-Davidson has developed a brief 
code of ethics that employees can apply both at work and in their personal lives. It reads: 
“Tell the truth, keep your promises, be fair, respect the individual and encourage 
intellectual curiosity.”
Ethical Education
Although a code of conduct can provide an overall framework, it cannot detail a solution 
for every ethical situation. Some ethical questions have black-and-white answers, but others

do not. Businesses must provide the tools employees need to evaluate the options and arrive 
at suitable decisions.
Many firms have either instituted their own ethics training programs or hired organi-
zations such as Syrus Global, which provides outsourced ethics and compliance programs 
to businesses. Among other services, Syrus hosts employee reporting services with an 
anonymous hotline and an ethics case management system. It also helps companies develop 
appropriate ethics codes with ethics training customized to each company’s needs, including 
specialized online, interactive training systems.16
Many authorities debate whether ethics can be taught, but training can give employees 
the chance to practice applying ethical values to hypothetical situations before they face real-
world situations. Similar strategies are being used in many business school ethics programs, 
where case studies and practical scenarios work best. Convicted white-collar criminal Walter 
Pavlo, a former employee at telecommunications firm MCI, speaks at colleges and universi-
ties about his experiences in the firm and prison. Pavlo, who along with other MCI associ-
ates stashed $6 million in offshore accounts, speaks about his actions in an effort to warn 
students of the consequences of cheating.
Ethical Action
Codes of conduct and ethics training help employees recognize and reason through ethi-
cal problems. In addition, firms must provide structures and approaches that allow decisions 
to be turned into ethical actions. Texas Instruments gives its employees a reference card to 
help them make ethical decisions on the job. The size of a standard business card, it lists the 
following guidelines:
 
• Is the action legal?
 • Does it comply with our values?
 • If you do it, will you feel bad?
 • How will it look in the newspaper?
 • If you know it’s wrong, don’t do it!
 • If you’re not sure, ask.
 • Keep asking until you get an answer.
Goals set for the business as a whole and for individual departments and employees 
can affect ethical behavior. A firm whose managers set unrealistic goals for employee 
performance may find an increase in cheating, lying, and other misdeeds, as employees 
attempt to protect themselves. In today’s Internet economy, the high value placed on 
speed can create a climate in which ethical behavior is sometimes challenged. Ethical 
decisions often require careful and quiet thought, a challenging task in today’s fast-paced 
business world.
Some companies encourage ethical action by providing support for employees faced with 
dilemmas. One common tool is an employee hotline, a telephone number that employees 
can call, often anonymously, for advice or to report unethical behavior they have witnessed. 
Ethics compliance officers at some firms, as mentioned previously, guide employees through 
ethical minefields.
CLASS ACTIVITY: 
Ask students if they can 
think of any examples 
where an action may be 
legal but unethical. 

Chapter 2  Business Ethics and Social Responsibility
47
Ethical Leadership
Executives must not only talk about ethical behavior but also demonstrate it in their 
actions. This requires employees to be personally committed to the company’s core values 
and be willing to base their actions on them. The recent recession exposed executive-level 
misdeeds that damaged or even destroyed entire organizations and wiped out people’s life 
savings. In the aftermath, two students at the Harvard Business School interviewed 
corporate leaders in their native India and Pakistan whom they regarded as highly moral. 
The students concluded that these “ethical mavericks” follow a moral code with three simple 
characteristics:
1. use clear, explicit language rather than euphemisms for corrupt behavior
2. encourage behavior that generates and fosters ethical values
3. practice moral absolutism, insisting on doing right, even if it proves financially costly.17
However, ethical leadership should also go one step further and charge each employee at 
every level with the responsibility to be an ethical leader. Everyone should be aware of prob-
lems and be willing to defend the organization’s standards.
Unfortunately, not all organizations are able to build a solid framework of business 
ethics. Because the damage from ethical misconduct can powerfully affect a firm’s 
stakeholders—customers, investors, employees, and the public—pressure is exerted on 
businesses to act in acceptable ways. But when businesses fail, the law must step in to enforce 
good business practices. Many of the laws that affect specific industries or individuals are 
described in other chapters in this book. For example, legislation affecting international 
business operations is discussed in Chapter 4. Laws designed to assist small businesses are 
examined in Chapter 5. Laws related to labor unions are described in Chapter 8. Legislation 
related to banking and the securities markets is discussed in Chapters 16 and 17. Finally, for 
an examination of the legal and governmental forces designed to safeguard society’s interests 
when businesses fail at self-regulation, see Appendix A, “Business Law.”
Acting Responsibly 
to Satisfy Society
A second major issue affecting business is the question of social responsibility. In a gen-
eral sense, social responsibility is management’s acceptance of the obligation to consider 
profit, consumer satisfaction, and societal well-being of equal value in evaluating the firm’s 
performance. It is the recognition that business must be concerned with the qualitative 
dimensions of consumer, employee, and societal benefits, as well as the quantitative measures 
of sales and profits, by which business performance is traditionally measured. Businesses may 
exercise social responsibility because such behavior is required by law, because it enhances 
the company’s image, or because management believes it is the ethical course of action. The

Starbucks Introduces a New Store-Design Strategy
In June 2009, the coffee-selling giant Starbucks announced that 
as it builds new stores and renovates existing ones worldwide, the 
company plans to design them with two goals in mind: reflecting the 
character of the neighborhood and striving for a reduced environmental 
impact.
The project is part of Starbucks’ efforts to reposition itself. Arthur 
Rubinfeld, the president of Starbucks Global Development, said, “We 
recognize the importance of continuously evolving with our customers’ 
interests, lifestyles and values in order to stay relevant over the long 
term.”
The company will employ local artisans and materials and use 
recycled and reclaimed materials to make each store unique. It has 
also commited itself to conserving water and energy, recycling 
where possible, and using “green” construction methods. Among its 
goals are:
 •
to use renewable resources for 50 percent of the energy used in its 
stores
 •
to make its stores 25 percent more energy efficient to reduce green-
house gas emissions
 •
to meet U.S. Green Building Code LEED (Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design) certification standards for all its new stores
 •
to implement a 100 percent reusable or recyclable cup supply by 2015
 •
to have recycling in stores where it controls waste collection by 2015.
The company has already put some of these goals into practice. 
For instance, it reduces its prices by 10 cents for customers who bring 
their own travel cups. The company is also replacing incandescent light 
bulbs with LED bulbs to save energy and expense. Special signs will be 
installed in new and renovated stores to explain their “green” and sus-
tainable features and construction methods.
Three stores now embody this new strategy: two in Starbucks’ 
hometown of Seattle and one at the Paris Disney Village.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How do Starbucks’ new plans for its stores reflect its sense 
of social responsibility?
2. How has Starbucks involved its customers in these efforts?

Historically, a company’s social performance has been measured by its contribution to the 
overall economy and the employment opportunities it provides. Variables such as total wages paid 
often indicate social performance. Although profits and employment remain important, today 
many factors contribute to an assessment of a firm’s social performance, including providing equal 
employment opportunities; respecting the cultural diversity of employees; responding to environ-
mental concerns; providing a safe, healthy workplace; and producing high-quality products that 
are safe to use.
A business is also judged by its interactions with the community. To demonstrate their social 
responsibility, many corporations highlight charitable contributions and community service in 
their annual reports and on their Web sites. The Mercadien Group, an accounting and busi-
ness consulting firm based in Princeton, New Jersey, participates in the Toys for Tots program 
with the U.S. Marine Corps. The company’s office is an official drop-off site for the program, 
and employees at all levels take part. Mercadien also invites its clients and other contacts to 
participate.18
Through its Box Tops for Education program, General Mills has helped more than 30,000 
grade and middle schools across the nation to raise funds for everything from books to food ser-
vice. According to the program’s Web site, more than $200 million has been raised by consumers 
who cut out and submitted to participating schools “box top” coupons from General Mills’s prod-
ucts such as Progresso soups, Green Giant vegetables, and cereals like Cheerios.19
Some firms measure social performance by conducting social audits, formal procedures 
that identify and evaluate all company activities that relate to social issues such as conservation,

employment practices, environmental protection, 
and philanthropy. The social audit informs manage-
ment about how well the company is performing in 
these areas. Based on this information, management 
may revise current programs or develop new ones.
Outside groups may conduct their own evalu-
ations of businesses. Various environmental, reli-
gious, and public-interest groups have created 
standards of corporate performance. Reports on 
many of these evaluations are available to the 
general public. The New York–based Council 
on Economic Priorities is one such group. Other 
groups publicize their evaluations and include cri-
tiques of the social responsibility performance of 
firms.
As Figure 2.5 shows, the social responsibilities 
of business can be classified according to its rela-
tionships to the general public, customers, employees, and investors and other members of 
the financial community. Many of these relationships extend beyond national borders.
Responsibilities to the General Public
The responsibilities of business to the general public include dealing with public health 
issues, protecting the environment, and developing the quality of the workforce. Many 
would argue that businesses also have responsibilities 
to support charitable and social causes and organiza-
tions that work toward the greater public good. In 
other words, they should give back to the communi-
ties in which they earn profits. Such efforts are called 
corporate philanthropy.
Public-Health Issues One of the most 
complex issues facing business as it addresses its ethi-
cal and social responsibilities to the general public is 
public health. Central to the public-health debate is 
the question of what businesses should do about dan-
gerous products such as tobacco and alcohol. Tobacco 
products represent a major health risk, contributing 
to heart disease, stroke, and cancer among smokers. 
Families and coworkers of smokers share this dan-
ger as well, as their exposure to secondhand smoke 
increases their risks for cancer, asthma, and respira-
tory infections. Many cities have not only banned 
smoking in public places, but also commercial busi-
nesses such as restaurants.
Heart disease, diabetes, and obesity have become 
major public health issues as the rates of these three 
conditions have been rising. A reported 5 million

overweight. Three-quarters of obese teenagers will become obese adults at risk for these 
diseases. Jared Fogle became famous for losing 245 pounds over a two-year period through 
exercise and a diet that included SUBWAY sandwiches. He has since set up the Jared 
Foundation with the goal of fighting childhood obesity by encouraging children to develop 
healthy diet and exercise habits. Spreading his message through speaking tours, grants 
to schools, and programs for children and their families, Fogle says, “My goal is to help 
children avoid the physical and emotional hardships I went through living with obesity.” 
SUBWAY’s Web site lists the nutritional values of its menu items and sources of diet and 
nutrition advice. The Web site also features a linked page supporting the Jared Foundation 
and its mission.20
Substance abuse is another serious public health problem worldwide. Revelations of the 
use of illegal steroids by many athletes, particularly in professional baseball, highlights the 
difficulty of devising accurate tests for performance-enhancing and muscle-building drugs 
and fairly evaluating the results. Many of the drugs in question are so similar to compounds 
naturally present in the body that identification is extremely difficult. With regard to drug 
testing, athletes’ individual rights to privacy have been questioned, particularly due to their 
widespread influence on youthful fans. Steroid use is on the rise among high school athletes, 
despite the publicity about the dangers of such drugs. Tougher penalties for professional 
players who fail drug tests are being formulated. In January 2010, Mark McGwire, who had 
hit a record-breaking 70 home runs in the 1998 season, admitted that he had used steroids 
during the 1990s.21 The “Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature explores a related public 
health issue: whether advertisements for prescription drugs are informative or harmful to 
consumers.
To do their part to aid the general public, SUBWAY and the Jared Foundation focus on encouraging children to eat 
healthfully in the hopes of avoiding obesity problems later in life.

Protecting the Environment Businesses consume huge amounts of energy, 
which increases the use of fossil fuels such as coal and oil for energy production. This activity 
introduces carbon dioxide and sulfur into the earth’s atmosphere. Meanwhile, the sulfur from 
fossil fuels combines with water vapor in the air to form sulfuric acid. The acid rain that results 
can travel across continents, killing fish and trees and polluting groundwater. Although acid rain 
has been tracked for many decades now, companies are still being cited and punished for viola-
tions. Duke Energy was recently fined $1.75 million for violating provisions of the Clean Air 
Act and must spend roughly $85 million to reduce air pollution from a power plant in Indiana.22
 
Since 1985 in the United States, drug manufacturers have used 
direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) to market name-brand prescrip-
tion drugs. DTCA increased dramatically after 1997, when the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) no longer required detailed lists of pos-
sible side effects. In 2009, pharmaceutical companies spent $4.5 billion 
on advertising. New Zealand is the only other developed country where 
DTCA is legal.
Americans now spend more on prescription drugs than on any 
other area of health care. One reason is the sheer number of pre-
scriptions. Another is that advertising costs have raised the prices of 
brand-name prescription drugs. Drug companies also market heavily to 
doctors. The medical community has voiced concern that DTCA may be 
harming both the public and the healthcare system.
Does direct-to-consumer advertising benefi t the 
American public?
Summary
Congress has repeatedly tried and failed to curb DTCA. Some proposals would end tax deductions 
for drug companies’ advertising expenses or require a waiting period before advertising a new drug. 
Pharmaceutical companies have tried to introduce DTCA in Europe, but European Union countries voted 
overwhelmingly against even an “information to patients” section of a proposed regulation.

PRO
1. DTCA encourages people to ask their doctors about potentially 
harmful conditions that may be helped by nonsurgical treatment if 
caught early enough.
2. Drug companies use their profits to develop new drugs. This 
process involves considerable research and testing to win FDA approval 
of drugs that can improve or even save lives.
CON
1. Drug advertisements appeal to people’s emotions while mini-
mizing potential side effects. Advertisements may even persuade 
people to ask for unnecessary treatments.
2. Pharmaceutical companies usually advertise new drugs that have 
not been tested over time and are more expensive than slightly different, 
older drugs with well-known side effects. DTCA sometimes backfires.
Are Prescription Drug Advertisements Helpful or Harmful to 
Consumers?

Other production and manufacturing methods leave behind large quanti-
ties of waste materials that can further pollute the environment and fill already 
bulging landfills. Some products themselves, particularly electronics that contain 
toxins such as lead and mercury, are difficult to reuse or recycle. Few manufac-
turers are really equipped to deal with recycled materials; some refurbish junked 
products and sell them abroad—where later recycling is even less likely. Hewlett-
Packard, however, is making its scanners with a combination of new and recycled 
plastics. Lead, mercury, and cadmium will soon be banned from new equipment 
manufactured in Europe. As stricter laws on electronic recycling come into effect, 
many manufacturers and retailers are offering take-back, mail-in, and trade-in 
programs for discarded electronic equipment. For example, all Best Buy stores 
now accept televisions, DVD players, computer monitors, cell phones, and other 
electronic devices. The stores charge a small fee for televisions 32 inches and 
under, CRTs (cathode ray tubes, now obsolete), monitors, and laptops, but will 
give customers a gift card in an equal amount.23
For many managers, finding ways to minimize pollution and other environ-
mental damage caused by their products or operating processes has become an 
important economic, legal, and social issue. When General Motors unveiled the 
Chevrolet Volt, the new car instantly vaulted past conventional hybrids that run 
on a combination of electricity and gasoline. As we saw earlier, the Volt is entirely 
electric. After its battery runs down, a gasoline engine powers an on-board gen-
erator that recharges the battery. General Motors settled on a 40-mile range for 
the battery because Department of Transportation studies have shown that over 
three-quarters of commuters drive about that distance to and from work every 
day, and half of all American households drive even less per day. GM’s 
Vehicle Line Director Tony Posawatz notes, “The beauty of the Volt is the size 
of the battery.”24
Despite the difficulty, however, companies are finding that they can be 
environmentally friendly and profitable, too. Another solution to the problems of 
pollutants is recycling—reprocessing used materials for reuse. Recycling can sometimes 
provide much of the raw material that manufacturers need, thereby conserving the world’s 
natural resources and reducing the need for landfills. The “Hit & Miss” feature describes 
a company with a creative twist on recycling, turning used restaurant oil and grease into 
clean, biodegradable biodiesel fuel.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, discarded electronic items now 
make up as much as 40 percent of the lead in landfills in the United States. The Institute of 
Scrap Recycling Industries estimates that about 2.8 billion pounds (1.4 million tons) of elec-
tronic equipment were recycled in a recent year. This amount comprised 65 million units of 
computer equipment such as CPUs, monitors, and printers. Electronics recycling processes 
resulted in 1.3 billion pounds of recyclable materials; more than half this amount consisted 
of metals. It is estimated that consumer electronics alone will soon amount to 3 million 
tons a year.25 Manufacturers and federal agencies are struggling to devise a viable system 
for managing the problem; one possibility is a surcharge consumers would pay on each 
electronics purchase. In the meantime, as we have seen, Best Buy, Staples, and other 
retailers accept all gadgets for recycling no matter where they were purchased, and 
Hewlett-Packard and Dell have agreed not to send waste materials overseas. Cisco 
Systems has opened a green-technology center in a joint program with one of China’s 
major universities as part of its long-term investment in that country. This will be a

Many consumers have favorable impressions of environmentally conscious businesses. 
To target these customers, companies often use green marketing, a marketing strategy that 
promotes environmentally safe products and production methods. A business cannot simply 
claim that its goods or services are environmentally friendly, however. The Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) has issued guidelines for businesses to follow in making environmental 
claims. A firm must be able to prove that any environmental claim made about a product has 
been substantiated with reliable scientific evidence. In addition, as shown in Figure 2.6, the 
FTC has given specific directions about how various environmental terms may be used in 
advertising and marketing.
Other environmental issues—such as finding renewable sources of clean energy and 
developing sustainable agriculture—are the focus of many firms’ efforts. Vinod Khosla, 
founder of Sun Microsystems, is now working with a group of high-powered entrepreneurs 
and investors in Silicon Valley to develop a new generation of energy.27 Solar energy, geo-
thermal energy, biodiesel, and wind power are just a few of the renewable sources of energy 
being developed by entrepreneurs, large energy firms, and small engineering companies. As 
we have seen in the “Hit & Miss” feature above, Pacific Biodiesel started with one plant and 
now has branches nationwide.
Mars Incorporated, the maker of Dove Chocolate and other candies, has committed to 
buying 100,000 tons of cocoa from Rainforest Alliance–certified farms. It is also working in 
conjunction with the market-oriented sustainability program UTZ Certified and intends to 
use sustainably grown cocoa in all of its chocolate products by 2020.28

In 1980, Robert King founded King Diesel on the island of Maui in 
Hawaii. The company used conventional diesel fuel to run the genera-
tors at the Central Maui Landfill, but in 1995, King became concerned 
at the large amounts of used cooking oil being dumped. He contacted 
Daryl Reece at the University of Idaho. Reece helped develop a process 
that successfully converted used restaurant oils into biodiesel fuel. 
Together they founded Pacific Biodiesel, using biodiesel to run the 
generators at the landfill in one of America’s first commercially viable, 
community-based biodiesel plants. Today Pacific Biodiesel and its asso-
ciated companies produce and sell biodiesel fuel and design, build, and 
support biodiesel plants around the country.
Biodegradable and nontoxic, biodiesel fuel can be used in any 
diesel engine. It is produced from renewable resources such as cooking 
oil and soybean oil, which would otherwise be dumped in landfills or 
down drains. Biodiesel significantly cuts down on many pollutants and 
reduces dependence on foreign oil.
On Maui, restaurants pay haulers to take their used cooking oil to 
the landfill. The haulers pay the county of Oahu for the right to dump 
garbage at waste facilities. Pacific Biodiesel’s facility at the landfill is 
rent free. The haulers’ fees cover most of the county’s payment to Pacific 
Biodiesel for processing the waste. Shipping this waste off island would 
be much more expensive; recycling it prolongs the useful life of the 
landfills and guarantees a local source of energy. On Maui alone, Pacific 
Biodiesel recycles about 200,000 gallons of oil and grease each year.
King says, “We definitely took a leap of faith, but . . . we wanted 
to do more . . . something to contribute to society. . . . [I]t is important 
to do . . . something that brings you happiness—because the feeling 
you get by ‘doing the right thing’ never disappears.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How might Pacific Biodiesel spread the message that 
recycling is good business as well as good for the environ-
ment? How might it reach out to other industries?
2. How does Pacific Biodiesel fulfill its responsibilities to the 
general public?

Developing the Quality of 
the Workforce In the past, a 
nation’s wealth has often been based 
on its money, production equipment, 
and natural resources. A country’s 
true wealth, however, lies in its peo-
ple. An educated, skilled workforce 
provides the intellectual know-how 
required to develop new technol-
ogy, improve productivity, and com-
pete in the global marketplace. It is 
becoming increasingly clear that to 
remain competitive, U.S. business 
must assume more responsibility for 
enhancing the quality of its work-
force, including encouraging diver-
sity of all kinds.
In developed economies like that 
of the United States, many new jobs 
require college-educated workers. With demand high for workers with advanced skills, the 
difference between the highest-paid and lowest-paid workers has been increasing. Education 
plays an important role in earnings, despite success stories of those who dropped out of col-
lege or high school to start businesses. Workers with professional degrees earn an average 
of $2,749 a week, whereas those with some high school but no diploma earn about $449.29 
Businesses must encourage students to stay in school, continue their education, and sharpen 
their skills. Cheerios supports Spoonfuls of Stories, a national program to encourage young 
children and their parents to read together by distributing more than 40 million books in 
specially marked cereal boxes. It also contributes to First Book, a nonprofit that gives chil-
dren from low-income households the chance to own their first new book.30
Organizations also face enormous responsibilities for helping women, members of vari-
ous cultural groups, and those who are physically challenged to contribute fully to the econ-
omy. Failure to do so is not only a waste of more than half the nation’s workforce but also 
devastating to a firm’s public image. Some socially responsible firms also encourage diversity 
in their business suppliers. Retail giant JCPenney’s Partnership Program is designed to fos-
ter relationships with minority- and women-owned businesses—an effort the company has 
worked at for more than 30 years.
Through a commitment to developing employee diversity, The Coca-Cola Company 
strives to create an inclusive atmosphere, offers diversity training for employees and manag-
ers, and encourages regular dialogue among colleagues, suppliers, customers, and stakehold-
ers. “By building an inclusive workplace environment, The Coca-Cola Company seeks to 
leverage its worldwide team, which is rich in diverse people, talent, and ideas,” says the com-
pany Web site.31 For a global organization to function competitively, diversity is vital.
Corporate Philanthropy As Chapter 1 pointed out, not-for-profit organiza-
tions play an important role in society by serving the public good. They provide the human 
resources that enhance the quality of life in communities around the world. To fulfill this 
mission, many not-for-profit organizations rely on financial contributions from the business 
community. Firms respond by donating billions of dollars each year to not-for-profit orga-
nizations. This corporate philanthropy includes cash contributions, donations of equip-
ment and products, and supporting the volunteer efforts of company employees. Recipients

include cultural organizations, adopt-a-school programs, community development agencies, 
and housing and job training programs.
Corporate philanthropy can have many positive benefits beyond the purely “feel-good” 
rewards of giving, such as higher employee morale, enhanced company image, and improved 
customer relationships. General Mills, for instance, is a major contributor to the Susan G. 
Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, through its line of yogurt products marketed under the 
Yoplait brand name. Yoplait’s target market is health-conscious women, the same group 
most likely to know of or become involved with the Komen Foundation’s fund-raising 
efforts. The firm also sponsors its My Hometown Helper program, a nationwide initiative 
that provides grants to communities, not-for-profit groups, and public schools for commu-
nity improvement projects.32
Companies often seek to align their marketing efforts with their charitable giving. Many 
contribute to the Olympics and create advertising that features the company’s sponsorship. 
This is known as cause-related marketing. In a recent survey, nearly nine out of ten young 
people said they believed companies had a duty to support social causes, and nearly seven in 
eight said they would switch brands in order to reward a company that did so. Consumers 
are often willing to pay even more for a product, such as Newman’s Own salad dressings and 
salsa, because they know the proceeds are going to a good cause.
Another form of corporate philanthropy is volunteerism. In their roles as corporate 
citizens, thousands of businesses encourage their employees to contribute their efforts to 
projects as diverse as Habitat for Humanity, the Red Cross, and the Humane Society. In 
addition to making tangible contributions to the well-being of fellow citizens, such programs 
generate considerable public support and goodwill for the companies and their employ-
ees. In some cases, the volunteer efforts occur mostly during off-hours for employees. In 
other instances, firms permits their workforces to volunteer during regular working hours. 
Sometimes volunteers with special skills are indispensable. After the devastating earthquake 
in Haiti, the pilots’ union at the shipping giant UPS volunteered to transport supplies and 
personnel in the relief effort.33
Responsibilities to Customers
Businesspeople share a social and ethical responsibility to treat their customers fairly and 
act in a manner that is not harmful to them. Consumerism—the public demand that a busi-
ness consider the wants and needs of its customers in making decisions—has gained wide-
spread acceptance. Consumerism is based on the belief that consumers have certain rights. A 
frequently quoted statement of consumer rights was made by President John F. Kennedy in 
1962. Figure 2.7 summarizes these consumer rights. Numerous state and federal laws have 
been implemented since then to protect these rights.
The Right to Be Safe Contemporary businesspeople must recognize obliga-
tions, both moral and legal, to ensure the safe operation of their products. Consumers 
should feel assured that the products they purchase will not cause injuries in normal use. 
Product liability refers to the responsibility of manufacturers for injuries and damages 
caused by their products. Items that lead to injuries, either directly or indirectly, can have 
disastrous consequences for their makers.
Many companies put their products through rigorous testing to avoid safety problems. 
Still, testing alone cannot foresee every eventuality. Companies must try to consider all pos-
sibilities and provide adequate warning of potential dangers. When a product does pose a 
threat to customer safety, a responsible manufacturer responds quickly to either correct the 
consumerism Public 
demand that a business 
consider the wants and 
needs of its customers in 
making decisions.

responsibility of manu-
facturers for injuries and 
damages caused by their 
products.
Corporate philanthropy can 
enhance a company’s customer 
relationships. Through sales of 
its Yoplait yogurt line, General 
Mills contributes to the Susan G.

a charity that is important to the 
health-conscious consumers who

problem or recall the dangerous product. Although we take for granted 
that our food supply is safe, sometimes contamination leaks in, causing 
illness or even death among some consumers. Ippolito International 
once voluntarily recalled more than 1,700 cartons of bunched spinach 
after random testing found that some bunches were contaminated with 
salmonella, a microorganism that produces infections and sometimes 
death in young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune 
systems. Fortunately, no illnesses were reported.34
The Right to Be Informed Consumers should have 
access to enough education and product information to make respon-
sible buying decisions. In their efforts to promote and sell their goods 
and services, companies can easily neglect consumers’ right to be fully 
informed. False or misleading advertising is a violation of the Wheeler-
Lea Act, a federal law enacted in 1938. The FTC and other federal 
and state agencies have established rules and regulations that govern 
advertising truthfulness. These rules prohibit businesses from making 
unsubstantiated claims about the performance or superiority of their 
merchandise. They also require businesses to avoid misleading con-
sumers. Businesses that fail to comply face scrutiny from the FTC and 
consumer protection organizations. For instance, Dannon Company settled a class-action 
lawsuit that charged the company with false advertising. Dannon claimed that two of its 
yogurt products, Activia, and DanActive, improved the immune system of the digestive tract. 
The company agreed to make changes in the labeling and advertising of those products, 
claiming instead that they merely interact with the immune system. Dannon also set up a 
Web site with information about the settlement and agreed to refund customers up to $100, 
depending on how much yogurt each customer bought.35
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which sets standards for advertising con-
ducted by drug manufacturers, eased restrictions for prescription drug advertising on televi-
sion. In print ads, drug makers are required to spell out potential side effects and the proper 
uses of prescription drugs. Because of the requirement to disclose this information, prescrip-
tion drug television advertising was limited. Now, however, the FDA says drug ads on radio 
and television can directly promote a prescription drug’s benefits if they provide a quick way 
for consumers to learn about side-effects, such as displaying a toll-free number or Internet 
address. As we have seen, the “Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature on page 51 discusses 
the pros and cons of such advertising.
The FDA also monitors “dietary supplements,” including vitamins and herbs. This 
includes protecting consumers against fake and sometimes harmful versions of name-brand 
supplements. In 2010, the FDA issued a public alert to warn consumers about counterfeit 
versions of Alli, an over-the-counter weight-loss supplement. Instead of the correct active 
ingredient, the counterfeit Alli contained a controlled substance that should not be used 
without a doctor’s supervision and that may actually harm certain patients. In addition, the 
packaging of the counterfeit was missing a “lot” code and differed in other, subtle ways from 
the genuine packaging. The fake capsules were different in size and shape from the real ones, 
too. Apparently all the fake Alli had been sold over the Internet rather than in stores, so cus-
tomers could not inspect the packaging or the capsules before receiving the product.36
The responsibility of business to preserve consumers’ right to be informed extends 
beyond avoiding misleading advertising. All communications with customers—from sales-
people’s comments to warranties and invoices—must be controlled to clearly and accurately

inform customers. Most packaged-goods firms, personal-computer makers, and other makers 
of products bought for personal use by consumers include toll-free customer service num-
bers on their product labels so that consumers can get answers to questions about a product.
To protect their customers and avoid claims of insufficient disclosure, businesses often 
include warnings on products. As Figure 2.8 shows, sometimes these warnings go far beyond 
what a reasonable consumer would expect. Others are downright funny.
The Right to Choose Consumers should have the right to choose which goods 
and services they need and want to purchase. Socially responsible firms attempt to preserve 
this right, even if they reduce their own sales and profits in the process. Brand-name drug 
makers have recently gone on the defensive in a battle being waged by state governments, 
insurance companies, consumer groups, unions, and major employers such as General Motors 
and Verizon. These groups want to force down the rising price of prescription drugs by 
ensuring that consumers have the right and the opportunity to select cheaper generic brands.
The Right to Be Heard Consumers should be able to express legitimate com-
plaints to appropriate parties. Many companies expend considerable effort to ensure full 
hearings for consumer complaints. The auction Web site eBay assists buyers and sellers 
who believe they were victimized in transactions conducted through the site. It deploys a 
200-employee team to work with users and law enforcement agencies to combat fraud. The 
company has strict guidelines for buyers and sellers and rules for leaving feedback about a 
buyer or seller. For example, buyers must operate within a list of acceptable goods for sale 
and may not offer such items as alcohol, pornography, drugs, counterfeit currency, or arti-
facts from cave formations, graves, or Native American sites. The protection of copyrights is 
also an important part of eBay’s policy.37
Responsibilities to Employees
Companies that can attract skilled and knowledgeable employees are better able to meet 
the challenges of competing globally. In return, businesses have wide-ranging responsibili-
ties to their employees, both here and abroad. These include workplace safety, quality-of-life 
issues, ensuring equal opportunity on the job, avoiding age discrimination, and preventing 
sexual harassment and sexism.

Workplace Safety A century ago, few businesses 
paid much attention to the safety of their workers. In fact, 
most business owners viewed employees as mere cogs in the 
production process. Workers—many of whom were young 
children—toiled in frequently dangerous conditions. In 1911, a 
fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City killed 
146 people, mostly young girls. Contributing to the massive 
loss of life were the sweatshop working conditions at the fac-
tory, including overcrowding, blocked exits, and a lack of fire 
escapes. This horrifying tragedy forced businesses to begin to 
recognize their responsibility for their workers’ safety.
The safety and health of workers on the job is now an 
important business responsibility. The Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA) is the main federal regulatory 
force in setting workplace safety and health standards. These 
mandates range from broad guidelines on storing hazardous 
materials to specific standards for worker safety in industries such as construction, manufac-
turing, and mining. OSHA tracks and investigates workplace accidents and has the authority 
to fine employers who are found liable for injuries and deaths that occur on the job.
One unsettling fact is that about 70 teens die every year in the United States as a result 
of work injuries. Most of these fatalities occur because of unsafe equipment, inadequate 
safety training, and dangerous work that is illegal or inappropriate for youth. OSHA is tak-
ing steps to educate employers and teen workers about safety, health, and a positive work 
environment. The OSHA Web site has a special section for teens with the answers to most 
frequently asked questions about such issues as wages, labor standards, harassment issues, 
and safety at work. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has rolled out a new initiative 
called YouthRules!, a project designed to further educate and empower young workers. The 
YouthRules! Web page offers information and activities for teens, parents, educators, and 
employers.38
Quality-of-Life Issues Balancing work and family is becoming harder for 
many employees. They find themselves squeezed between working long hours and handling 
child-care problems, caring for elderly parents, and solving other family crises. A sandwich 
generation of households, those caring for two generations—their children and their aging 
parents—has arisen. As the population ages, the share of American households providing 
some type of care to a relative or friend age 50 or older has grown dramatically in the early 
years of the 21st century. At the same time, as married women spend more time working 
outside the home, they have fewer hours per week to spend on family. The employees jug-
gling work with life’s other demands aren’t just working mothers. Childless couples, single 
people, and men all express frustration with the pressures of balancing work with family and 
personal needs. To help with the work–life balance, some employers are offering flexible 
work schedules so that parents can meet the needs of their children (or aging parents) as well 
as their jobs. Working Mother magazine offers up their list of 100 best companies to work for 
offering work–life balance. Of the 100 companies on the list, 100 percent offer telecommut-
ing and flexible schedules, 98 percent offer job-sharing, 86 percent have backup child care, 
and 62 percent provide care for sick children.39 Increasingly, women are starting their own 
businesses so they can set their own hours and goals. The “Hit & Miss” feature portrays one 
woman who started her own business to provide her ailing son the care he needed.
Some companies have come up with truly innovative ways to deal with work schedules, 
including paid time off for vacation or illness. At some of its locations, IBM has done away

In 2000, Zhena Muzyka was living in Ojai, California, a 25-year-old 
single mother whose infant son needed kidney surgery. Muzyka had no 
health insurance and only a few dollars in the bank. From watching her 
Rom (gypsy) grandmother tend a huge garden and blend teas, she had 
always been interested in herbal medicine, so she borrowed money from 
her parents and her brother and started Zhena’s Gypsy Tea from a cart in 
a friend’s antique store. At first, she was able to keep her son, Sage, with 
her in a baby carrier. When her teas proved popular—and Sage outgrew 
the carrier—she realized she had reached a turning point.
Muzyka searched for new sources and started blending her own 
loose-leaf teas, adding essential oils for their medicinal value. She 
discovered that none of the teas she was buying were organic or 
fair trade. She made the change to fair trade teas after learning 
that infant mortality rates among tea pickers on non–fair trade farms 
can reach 70 percent. Fair trade tea workers have guaranteed health 
care, clean water, education, and maternity leave and child care.
As Zhena’s Gypsy Tea has grown and diversified, Muzhaka has 
searched for new ways to put her values into practice. Her Pink Tea for 
Women’s Health is a partner of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. 
The company now uses corn silk for its teabags. It buys wind credits, 
even though that lowers profits. Muzyka says, “[Zhena’s Gypsy Tea] is 
the most ‘worth it’ thing I’ve ever done. Knowing that we’re sincerely 
making a difference for people and helping them out of poverty—while 
providing a delicious cup of tea for consumers here—is pretty satisfying.”
And Sage? After three operations, he got a clean bill of health in 
2007.

with prescribed vacation time altogether—the focus is on results. Employees have an infor-
mal agreement with their supervisors about when they will be out of the office, based on 
their ability to complete their work on schedule. The number of days they take off is not 
tracked; instead vacation time is considered open ended. But the catch is, the work has to be 
done. Perhaps surprisingly, the firm found that employees put in just as many hours, if not 
more, under the new program. According to an IBM representative, “. . . there is no polic-
ing, and employees are empowered to take vacation when they want.”40
Another solution has been to offer family leave to employees who need to deal with 
family matters. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, businesses with 50 or more 
employees must provide unpaid leave annually for any employee who wants time off for the 
birth or adoption of a child; to become a foster parent; or to care for a seriously ill relative, 
spouse, or self if he or she has a serious health condition or injury. The law requires employers 
to grant up to 12 weeks of leave each year, and leave may be taken intermittently as medical 
conditions make necessary. This unpaid leave also applies to an employee who has a serious ill-
ness. Workers must meet certain eligibility requirements. Employers must continue to provide 
health benefits during the leave and guarantee that employees will return to equivalent jobs. 
The issue of who is entitled to health benefits can also create a dilemma as companies struggle 
to balance the needs of their employees against the staggering costs of health care.
Ensuring Equal Opportunity on the Job Businesspeople face many 
challenges managing an increasingly diverse workforce in the 21st century. Technological 
advances are expanding the ways people with physical disabilities can contribute in the 
workplace. Businesses also need to find ways to responsibly recruit and manage older work-
ers and workers with varying lifestyles. In addition, beginning with Lotus Development in 
1982, companies have begun to extend benefits equally to employees, regardless of sexual 
orientation. In particular, that means the company offers benefits such as health insurance to

and Medical Leave Act of

unmarried domestic partners if it offers them to spouses of married couples. Companies that 
now offer these gender-neutral benefits include Avon Products, Costco Wholesale, Disney, 
General Mills, and Mattel.
To a great extent, efforts at managing diversity are regulated by law. The Civil Rights 
Act (1964) outlawed many kinds of discriminatory practices, and Title VII of the act spe-
cifically prohibits discrimination—biased treatment of a job candidate or employee—in 
the workplace. As shown in Table 2.2, other nondiscrimination laws include the Equal Pay

Opportunity Act (1972), the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (1978), the Civil Rights Act of 
1991, and numerous executive orders. The Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) protects 
the rights of physically challenged people. The Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act 
(1974) protects the employment of veterans of the Vietnam War. The Genetic Information 
Nondiscrimination Act (2008) prohibits discrimination on the basis of genetic tests or the 
medical history of an individual or that individual’s family.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was created to increase 
job opportunities for women and minorities and to help end discrimination based on race, 
color, religion, disability, gender, or national origin in any personnel action. To enforce 
fair-employment laws, it investigates charges of discrimination and harassment and files 
suit against violators. The EEOC can also help employers set up programs to increase job 
opportunities for women, minorities, people with disabilities, and people in other protected 
categories.
Fair treatment of employees is more than a matter of complying with EEOC regula-
tions, however. All employees want to be treated with respect. A minority employee who 
misses out on a plum assignment may miss out on the big raise that goes with it. As the 
employee’s salary grows more slowly, managers may eventually begin to use the size of the 
salary as an indicator that the employee contributes less to the organization. While in the 
past the EEOC has focused on this type of individual situation, currently it is addressing 
what it terms “systemic discrimination,” which it defines as “a pattern or practice, policy 
and/or class cases where the alleged discrimination has a broad impact on an industry, pro-
fession, company, or geographic location.” A systemic discrimination charge usually becomes 
a class-action suit, which costs considerably more to defend than an individual lawsuit. So 
firms are examining their employment practices carefully to make sure they are not open to 
discrimination charges.41 Chapter 9 takes a closer look at diversity and employment discrimi-
nation issues as part of a discussion of human resource management.
Age Discrimination With the average age of U.S. workers steadily rising, more 
than half the workforce is projected to be age 40 or older in a few years. Yet some employers 
find it less expensive to hire and retain younger workers, who generally have lower medi-
cal bills as well as lower salary and benefits packages. At the same time, many older workers 
have training and skills that younger workers have yet to acquire. The Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) protects individuals who are age 40 or older, prohibiting 
discrimination on the basis of age and denial of benefits to older employees.
Ruling in a lawsuit brought under the ADEA, the Supreme Court determined that 
employers can be held liable for age discrimination against older workers even if they 
intended no harm. At the same time, the court allowed employers to use “reasonable” fac-
tors such as cost cutting to defend business practices that might have more severe impacts on 
older than on younger workers. However, in June 2009, a new Court ruling shifted the bur-
den of proof onto employees seeking to prove that age discrimination was a factor in their 
demotion or dismissal.42
Legal issues aside, employers might do well to consider not only the experience 
that older workers bring to the workplace but also their enthusiasm. “Job satisfaction is 
especially high among those 65 and over because most people working at that age are 
not forced to still work, due to financial reasons, but choose to do so because they like 
their jobs,” points out the leader of a study conducted by researchers at the University of 
Chicago. Nearly 75 percent of those over 65 who were interviewed said they were very 
happy with their jobs.43

tion based on race, color,

In all cases, employers need to plan ahead for the aging of the workforce, finding ways 
to retain accumulated business wisdom, prepare for the demand for health services, and be 
ready for growth in the industries that serve seniors. The 55 to 64 age group will increase 
from just over 18 percent to almost 24 percent over the next few years, whereas the 35 to 
44 age group will decrease by just over 4 percent. These numbers signify a coming shift in 
the workforce, as well as in the goods and services needed.44
Sexual Harassment and Sexism Every employer has a responsibility 
to ensure that all workers are treated fairly and are safe from sexual harassment. Sexual 
harassment refers to unwelcome and inappropriate actions of a sexual nature in the work-
place. It is a form of sex discrimination that violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which 
gives both men and women the right to file lawsuits for intentional sexual harassment. 
Almost 14,000 sexual harassment complaints are filed with the EEOC each year, of which 
about 16 percent are filed by men.45 Thousands of other cases are either handled internally 
by companies or never reported.
Two types of sexual harassment exist. The first type occurs when an employee is pres-
sured to comply with unwelcome advances and requests for sexual favors in return for job 
security, promotions, and raises. The second type results from a hostile work environment in 
which an employee feels hassled or degraded because of unwelcome flirting, lewd comments, 
or obscene jokes. The courts have ruled that allowing sexually oriented materials in the 
workplace can create a hostile atmosphere that interferes with an employee’s ability to do the 
job. Employers are also legally responsible to protect employees from sexual harassment by 
customers and clients. The EEOC’s Web site informs employers and employees of criteria 
for identifying sexual harassment and how it should be handled in the workplace.
Preventing sexual harassment can be difficult because it involves regulating the 
conduct of individual employees. Sometimes victims, especially young employees, are 
intimidated or unaware of their rights, but the EEOC has set up a Youth@Work program 
sexual harass-
ment Unwelcome and 
inappropriate actions of a 
sexual nature in the work-
place.
Employers are responsible for avoiding age discrimination in the workplace. As the average age of workers 
rises, employers will benefit from the older generation’s knowledge.

(http://www.eeoc.gov/youth) to ensure that young workers can learn about the various types 
of discrimination and ways to avoid them.
The cost in settlements or fines can be enormous. So in addition to ethical and legal rea-
sons, it makes good business sense for firms to prevent this kind of behavior from happening. 
To avoid sexual harassment problems, many firms have established policies and employee 
education programs aimed at preventing such violations. An effective harassment prevention 
program should include the following measures:
 
• Issue a specific policy statement prohibiting sexual harassment.
 • Develop a complaint procedure for employees to follow.
 • Create a work atmosphere that encourages sexually harassed staffers to come forward.
 • Investigate and resolve complaints quickly and take disciplinary action against harassers.
Unless all these components are supported by top management, sexual harassment is dif-
ficult to eliminate.
Sexual harassment is often part of the broader problem of sexism—discrimination 
against members of either sex, but primarily affecting women. One important sexism issue is 
equal pay for equal work.
Lilly Ledbetter was near retirement when she found out that for a considerable length of 
time, men at her management level had been getting paid more than she had been. But the 
Supreme Court threw out her case because she did not sue within the statute of limitations—
that is, within 180 days of the first instance of a lower paycheck. In January 2009, President 
Barack Obama signed a law that extended the statute of limitations in such cases.46
On average, according to the American Association of University Women, a college-
educated woman 25 years and older earns $50,600 per year working full time while her male 
counterpart earns $70,800. Education, occupation, work hours, and other factors don’t seem 
to affect the gap, which remains unexplained other than the penalty of gender.47 In some 
extreme cases, differences in pay and advancement can become the basis for sex discrimina-
tion suits, which, like sexual harassment suits, can be costly and time consuming to settle. As 
in all business practices, it is better to act legally and ethically in the first place.
Responsibilities to Investors and the Financial 
Community
Although a fundamental goal of any business is to make a profit for its shareholders, 
investors and the financial community demand that businesses behave ethically and legally. 
When firms fail in this responsibility, thousands of investors and consumers can suffer.
State and federal government agencies are responsible for protecting investors from 
financial misdeeds. At the federal level, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
investigates suspicions of unethical or illegal behavior by publicly traded firms. It investigates 
accusations that a business is using faulty accounting practices to inaccurately portray its 
financial resources and profits to investors. Regulation FD (“Fair Disclosure”) is an SEC rule 
that requires publicly traded companies to announce major information to the general public, 
rather than first disclosing the information to selected major investors. The agency also oper-
ates an Office of Internet Enforcement to target fraud in online trading and online sales of 
stock by unlicensed sellers. Recall that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 also protects investors 
from unethical accounting practices. Chapter 17 discusses securities trading practices further.

Summary of Learning Goals
What’s Ahead
The decisions and actions of businesspeople are often influenced by outside forces such 
as the legal environment and society’s expectations about business responsibility. Firms also 
are affected by the economic environments in which they operate. The next chapter dis-
cusses the broad economic issues that influence businesses around the world. Our discussion 
will focus on how factors such as supply and demand, unemployment, inflation, and govern-
ment monetary policies pose both challenges and opportunities for firms seeking to compete 
in the global marketplace.
Explain the concepts of business ethics and social 
responsibility.
Business ethics refers to the standards of conduct and moral 
values that businesspeople rely on to guide their actions and 
decisions in the workplace. Businesspeople must take a wide 
range of social issues into account when making decisions. 
Social responsibility refers to management’s acceptance of 
the obligation to put an equal value on profit, consumer 
satisfaction, and societal well-being in evaluating the firm’s 
performance.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 To whom do businesses have responsibilities? Businesses 
are responsible to customers, employees, investors, and society.
1.2 If a firm is meeting all its responsibilities to others, why 
do ethical conflicts arise? Ethical conflicts arise because business 
must balance doing what is right and doing what is profitable.
Describe the factors that influence business ethics.
Among the many factors shaping individual ethics are per-
sonal experience, peer pressure, and organizational culture. 
Individual ethics are also influenced by family, cultural, and 
religious standards. Additionally, the culture of the organiza-
tion where a person works can be a factor.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 What role can an ethics compliance officer play in a 
firm? Ethics compliance officers are charged with deterring 
wrongdoing and ensuring that ethical standards are met.
2.2 What factors influence the ethical environment of a 
business? Individual ethics and technology influence the 
ethical environment of a business.
List the stages in the development of ethical standards, 
and discuss how organizations shape ethical behavior.
In the preconventional stage, individuals primarily consider 
their own needs and desires in making decisions. They obey 
external rules only from fear of punishment or hope of 
reward. In the conventional stage, individuals are aware of 
and respond to their duty to others. Expectations of groups, 
as well as self-interest, influence behavior. In the postcon-
ventional stage, the individual can move beyond self-interest 
and duty to include consideration of the needs of society. 
A person in this stage can apply personal ethical principles 
in a variety of situations. Conflicts of interest occur when a 
businessperson is faced with a situation in which an action 
benefiting one person has the potential to harm another, as 
when the person’s own interests conflict with those of a cus-
tomer. Honesty and integrity are valued qualities that engen-
der trust, but a person’s immediate self-interest may seem 
to require violating these principles. Loyalty to an employer 
sometimes conflicts with truthfulness. Whistle-blowing is 
a possible response to misconduct in the workplace, but 
the personal costs of doing so may be high. Employees are 
strongly influenced by the standards of conduct established 
and supported within the organizations where they work. 
Businesses can help shape ethical behavior by developing 
codes of conduct that define their expectations. Organizations 
can also use this training to develop employees’ ethics aware-
ness and reasoning. They can foster ethical action through 
decision-making tools, goals consistent with ethical behavior, 
and advice hotlines. Executives must also demonstrate ethi-
cal behavior in their decisions and actions to provide ethical 
leadership.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 What is the preconventional stage in the develop-
ment of ethical standards? In the preconventional stage, the 
individual looks out for his or her own interests and follows 
rules out of fear of punishment or hope of reward.
3.2 How can loyalty and truth come into conflict for an 
employee? Truth and loyalty can come into conflict when 
the truth about a company or situation is unfavorable.
3.3 How does ethical leadership contribute to ethical 
standards throughout a company? Employees more readily

commit to the company’s core values when they see that 
leaders and managers behave ethically.
Describe how businesses’ social responsibility is mea-
sured, and summarize the responsibilities of business to 
the general public, customers, and employees.
Today’s businesses are expected to weigh their qualitative 
impact on consumers and society, in addition to their quanti-
tative economic contributions such as sales, employment lev-
els, and profits. One measure is their compliance with labor 
and consumer protection laws and their charitable contribu-
tions. Another measure some businesses take is to conduct 
social audits. Public-interest groups also create standards and 
measure companies’ performance relative to those standards. 
The responsibilities of business to the general public include 
protecting the public health and the environment and devel-
oping the quality of the workforce. Additionally, many would 
argue that businesses have a social responsibility to support 
charitable and social causes in the communities in which 
they earn profits. Business also must treat customers fairly 
and protect consumers, upholding their rights to be safe, to 
be informed, to choose, and to be heard. Businesses have 
wide-ranging responsibilities to their workers. They should 
make sure that the workplace is safe, address quality-of-life 
issues, ensure equal opportunity, and prevent sexual harass-
ment and other forms of discrimination.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 What is meant by social responsibility, and why do 
firms exercise it? Social responsibility is management’s 
acceptance of its obligation to consider profit, consumer 
satisfaction, and societal well-being to be of equal value 
when evaluating the firm’s performance. Businesses exer-
cise it because it is required by law, because it enhances the 
company’s image, or because management believes it is the 
right thing to do.
4.2 What is green marketing? Green marketing is a mar-
keting strategy that promotes environmentally safe products 
and production methods.
4.3 What are the four main consumer rights? The 
four main consumer rights are the right to be safe, to be 
informed, to choose, and to be heard.
Explain why investors and the financial community are 
concerned with business ethics and social responsibility.
Investors and the financial community demand that busi-
nesses behave ethically as well as legally in handling their 
financial transactions. Businesses must be honest in report-
ing their profits and financial performance to avoid mislead-
ing investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission is 
the federal agency responsible for investigating suspicions 
that publicly traded firms have engaged in unethical or ille-
gal financial behavior.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 Why do firms need to do more than just earn a profit? 
Firms need to do more than just earn a profit because the law 
requires them to behave in a legal and ethical manner and 
because investors and shareholders demand such behavior.
5.2 What is the role of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission? Among other functions, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission investigates suspicions of unethical 
or illegal behavior by publicly traded firms.

Projects and Teamwork Applications
1. Write your own personal code of ethics. Create standards 
for your behavior at school, in personal relationships, and on 
the job. Then assess how well you meet your own standards 
and revise them if necessary.
2. On your own or with a classmate, visit the Web site of one 
of the following firms, or choose another that interests 
you. On the basis of what you can learn about the company 
from the site, construct a chart or figure that illustrates 
examples of the firm’s ethical awareness, ethical education, 
ethical actions, and ethical leadership. Present your findings 
to class.
 
a. Sun Microsystems
 
b. NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB, MLS (or any major profes-
sional sports league)
 
c. Hewlett-Packard
 
d. Foundation Health Systems
 
e. Irving Oil
 
f. Costco
 
g. IKEA
3. Now take the company you studied for question 2 (or choose 
another one) and conduct a social audit on that firm. Do 
your findings match the firm’s culture of ethics? If there are 
any differences, what are they and why might they occur?
4. On your own or with a classmate, go online, flip through a 
magazine, or surf television channels to identify a firm that is 
engaged in green marketing. If you see a commercial on televi-
sion, go to the firm’s Web site to learn more about the product 
or process advertised. Does the firm make claims that comply 
with the FTC guidelines? Present your findings in class.
5. As a consumer, you have come to expect a certain level of 
responsibility toward you on the part of companies with 
which you do business. Describe a situation in which you felt 
that a company did not recognize your rights as a consumer. 
How did you handle the situation? How did the company 
handle it? What was the final outcome?

Cause-Related Marketing—Give a Day, 
Get a Disney Day
Pink ribbons for breast cancer research. Product Red 
merchandise for fighting HIV/AIDS and other diseases. 
Yellow LiveStrong bracelets for cancer research. These 
campaigns are examples of cause-related marketing. A 
typical cause-related marketing campaign teams one or 
more nonprofit organizations with for-profit ones. The for-
profit organization announces publicly that it will donate 
some or all of the proceeds from a product or products 
to the nonprofit organization. For example, if you buy 
an iPod Nano Product [Red], a Starbucks [Red] card, or 
a Product [Red] T-shirt from the Gap, that corporation 
makes a contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis, and Malaria. One hundred percent of the 
contribution goes to grants financed by the Global Fund 
for projects in Africa.
Cause-related marketing began in 1976 when the 
March of Dimes, which fights birth defects, wanted to raise 
funds in the West. It teamed with Marriott Corporation, 
which wanted to generate publicity for its new Great 
America theme park in California. The campaign was a 
huge success. Cause-related marketing has grown from 
almost nothing to roughly $1.57 billion. Social networking 
groups such as Facebook and Twitter have become official 
or unofficial resources for information and for spreading 
the word about causes such as education, fighting disease, 
clean water, and environmental issues.
After the recent recession, consumers spent less and 
turned to inexpensive, family-oriented activities. In this 
climate, a new type of cause-related partnership came into 
being.
Disney Parks announced its new “Give a Day, Get a 
Disney Day” program for 2010. In partnership with the 
HandsOn Network, a national volunteer network, Disney 
offered free one-day, one-park admission to the first mil-
lion people who performed one day of certified volunteer 
work for a participating charity or other program. Habitat 
for Humanity and Ronald McDonald House Charities were 
just two of the nationwide programs, but volunteers could 
also clean up a local park; work at a homeless shelter, 
museum, or other institution; or walk or run for a cause 
such as diabetes or heart disease. Many of the activities 
were family oriented and were intended to help parents 
teach their children about volunteering. Families of up to 
eight could volunteer together, and children as young as 
six could participate.
Jay Rasulo, the chairman of Walt Disney Parks and 
Resorts, said, “. . . we want to recognize . . . the contribu-
tions people make to their communities every day. We 
want to inspire 1 million volunteers—people who will 
invest time and energy to make their own communities 
and neighborhoods a better place.”
Visitors can check the Disney Web site to find oppor-
tunities, arranged by location, for volunteering through the 
HandsOn network. So many people visited the sign-up page 
on that day that it crashed several times. Although Disney 
had no official social network pages, multiple unofficial 
ones were created. In addition, HandsOn publicized the pro-
gram through its Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts.
Tree Fresno’s goal is to reforest areas near the San 
Joaquin Valley in California. More than 150 people, many in 
families, volunteered through the Disney program to spend 
a day planting seedlings. A thousand other people in family 
groups also signed up to volunteer. The program was closing 
in on its goal of 1 million volunteers. Although it is too soon 
to tell whether volunteer cause-related marketing will become 
more common, the success of “Give a Day, Get a Disney 
Day” has set a standard to which future projects can aspire.

Case 2.1

Part 1  Business in a Global Environment
68
For many years, environmentalists have advocated 
slower driving and slower flying as ways to save fuel and 
cut down on emissions of greenhouse gases. This equation 
applies at sea as well as on land and in the air. When the 
price of oil reached $145 a barrel, the container shipping 
giant Maersk Line decided to take action.
Based in Copenhagen, Maersk is the largest shipping 
line in the world, with more than 500 vessels. Instead of 
the standard speed of 24 or 25 knots (just under 29 miles 
per hour), the Ebba Maersk sails at 12 knots (just under 14 
miles per hour), a speed known in the industry as “super 
slow steaming.” Super slow steaming reduces fuel con-
sumption from 350 tons per day to 100 to 150 tons and 
saves $5,000 an hour. Maersk has shifted hundreds of its 
ships to super slow steaming. Other shipping lines resisted 
slowing their vessels down at first, but now many of them 
have adopted “slow steaming” speed (20 knots, or 23 
miles per hour) or super slow steaming.
The recent recession created a further incentive for 
container shipping lines to reduce costs and save energy. 
Among other measures, Maersk’s ships have lowered their 
interior lighting and substituted rolls of paper towels for 
paper napkins in their dining salons. “The previous focus 
has been on ‘What will it cost?’ and ‘Get it to me as fast 
as possible,’ ” said Søren Stig Nielsen, the director of envi-
ronmental sustainability at Maersk. “But now there is a 
third dimension. What’s the CO2 footprint?”
Then there are the containers themselves. Whether 
empty or full, they occupy the same amount of space. 
Made of steel, they are still heavy even when empty. 
The Dutch company Cargoshell has devised a container 
that, when empty, collapses in less than half a minute to 
one-quarter the size of a full one. Thus Cargoshells can 
be stacked more compactly than steel containers. Steel 
containers usually have outward-opening doors that take 
up an entire side panel. The Cargoshell’s door simply rolls 
up or down. Cargoshells are made of fiber-reinforced 
composite materials, so they weigh 25 percent less than 
steel containers. They need no paint because they do not 
corrode. The composites are good insulators, important for 
temperature control. Manufacturing Cargoshells generates 
less carbon dioxide than manufacturing steel containers. 
All these factors add up to reduced costs, energy savings, 
and lower carbon emissions.
The ports where cargo ships arrive and depart are 
crowded with cranes, trucks, trains, tugboats, and 
ferries—all of which emit diesel exhaust into the 
atmosphere. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) has declared diesel exhaust to be a possible car-
cinogen. To reduce exposure to it, the EPA has initiated 
Clean Ports USA, a voluntary, incentive-based program 
to encourage ports and truck fleet owners to reduce 
emissions. Strategies include changing to cleaner-
burning diesel fuels; retrofitting or repairing existing 
diesel engines (which can last 20 or 30 years); replac-
ing aging engines or vehicles with newer, less-polluting 
ones; and reducing time that engines are left idling. 
In an unlikely alliance, the Teamsters union and 
environmentalists have joined forces to persuade the 
Port of Los Angeles to ban older trucks from transport-
ing goods away from port and have the trucking com-
panies buy newer, cleaner-running rigs.
Taken separately, all these measures are worthy 
efforts to fight global warming. Taken together, they could 
add up to a “green” integration of almost all aspects of 
the shipping industry.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How do Maersk and Cargoshell carry out their 
responsibilities to society?
2. Many of the goods you buy and use are 
imported from overseas and sold more cheaply 
than if they were made in the United States. 
But do they have hidden, nonmonetary costs? 
Use the information in this case as a guide.

Seventh Generation:  Beyond Paper and Plastic
CASE 1.3
Case 2.3
Seventh Generation was founded in Vermont twenty 
years ago on the premise that there’s a better way to do 
business, one that protects both the planet and the 
people. The company’s name is derived from the Great 
Law of the Iroquois, which mandates that “In every delib-
eration, we must consider the impact of our decision on 
the next seven generations.” Co-founder and executive 
chairman Jeffrey Hollender takes this mandate literally.
Hollender refers to himself as “chief protagonist” of 
Seventh Generation. For two decades he has campaigned 
for environmentally responsible consumer products, manu-
facturing processes, and operations at Seventh Generation. 
In addition, he campaigns outside the company to raise 
awareness about the importance of consumerism in pres-
ervation of the environment.
Hollender admits to watershed moments in his own life 
that have led him to redirect his company. When his young 
son had a particularly severe asthma attack, the doctor told 
Hollender that the best way to controls his son’s asthma 
was to control his environment—in particular, his household 
environment. Hollender recognized the enormity of this state-
ment and took it on as a corporate challenge. EPA research 
had already revealed that the air in the average home is two 
to five times more polluted than outdoor air. “I realized then 
that Seventh Generation had a lot more to offer than pro-
tecting the outdoor environment, and it became the turning 
point for the company.” If Seventh Generation could offer a 
broad spectrum of household products that did not contrib-
ute to indoor pollution—but performed cleaning and other 
tasks as effectively as products containing toxic chemicals—
the company could achieve an entirely new level of corporate 
responsibility.
Senior chemist Cara Bondi describes the challenge she 
and her colleagues faced. “Prior to the last decade, compa-
nies would try to put out green products but they didn’t really 
do the job,” which resulted in these products failing in the 
marketplace. If they weren’t effective at cleaning laundry or 
dishes, appealing to consumers’ consciences wouldn’t help. 
“If you expect someone to transition from a traditional clean-
ing product to green cleaning products, you need to have 
the performance that they expect,” she explains. “It was a 
problem that needed to be addressed. We wanted to be able 
to give consumers a solution that was authentic and sustain-
ing.” In recent years, scientists have been able to isolate 
more naturally derived ingredients that are equal to chemi-
cally based ingredients. Now consumers must be re-educated 
about these products and convinced to give them another try. 
One such product has been developed by Seventh Generation 
in partnership with another firm, CleanWell. It is a disinfectant 
made from the garden herb thyme. The new product actually 
kills bacteria on surfaces without the use of toxic chemicals. 
As chief executive, Hollender must consider his company 
as a whole organization—not just a chemistry lab. “When 
you think about sustainability and responsibility, you have 
to take a holistic approach,” he notes. “You have to look 
at everything in your supply chain and the life cycle of the 
product.” Hollender emphasizes that a socially responsible 
firm must consider every input and output, including raw 
materials, harvesting, manufacturing processes, warehousing, 
sales, and ultimate use—whether the consumer uses up the 
product, reuses or recycles it, or throws it away. Hollender 
describes how, in examining Seventh Generation’s inputs and 
outputs, company researchers discovered that the single most 
energy-wasting feature of its soap products was the fact that 
they required hot water to perform effectively. So the firm’s 
team reformulated them to function in cold water. 
Seventh Generation continues to develop new and 
better products. The firm’s Web site is filled with informa-
tion on sustainability, including the blog “Ask the Science 
Man,” where consumers can ask just about any question—
such as how to find nontoxic nail polish. And though 
Hollender’s involvement in day-to-day operations is reduced 
as he takes his message to a nationwide audience, he 
remains committed to his company’s corporate responsibil-
ity. “Few businesses are willing to talk about their failures,” 
he says. “But it’s that level of transparency that will build 
deep loyalty with the consumer.”Hollender is determined to 
build a loyalty that will last at least seven generations.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What might be some ethical issues faced by 
Seventh Generation managers, researchers, and 
employees? 
2. What steps might Hollender take to ensure that 
ethical leadership continues as he spends more 
time away from Seventh Generation?
3. Give examples of ways in which Seventh 
Generation fulfills its social responsibilities in 
each of the four categories: to the general pub-
lic; to customers; to investors; and to employees.
4. Visit the Seventh Generation Web site at 
http://www.seventhgeneration.com and read 
more about the firm’s community involvement. 
Discuss the company’s efforts. Do they match 
well with the Great Law of the Iroquois?

Economic Challenges Facing 
Contemporary Business

 I n the wake of the recession, one company 
has not only recovered but has even taken the lead 
in some areas. That company is Samsung, based in 
South Korea.
Founded in 1937, Samsung (“three stars” in Korean) 
is a multinational, global electronics manufacturer. 
Accounting for 20 percent of South Korea’s exports, 
it is the largest technology company in Asia. It is the 
world’s number-one maker of memory chips, the 
biggest television brand, and the number-two maker 
of liquid-crystal display (LCD) screens and mobile 
phones.
Like many firms worldwide, Samsung lost ground 
during the recent recession. Unlike at least some 
others, it made a strong recovery. Previously, 
Samsung’s share of the global market in LCD 
televisions and mobile phones was in the mid-
teens; but that share has increased to more than 
20 percent. Samsung also passed Hewlett-Packard 
to become the world’s largest electronic company 
measured in sales, earning $121 billion. Samsung 
predicted new growth because of renewed 
corporate demand for personal computers and 
Chinese demand for flat-screen TVs (Samsung ships 
25 percent of its exports to China) and because of 
sports events such as the World Cup.
The company partly owes its rapid recovery to 
advances in flat-screen-TV technology. According to 
Scott Birnbaum, the vice president of Samsung’s LCD 
division, “People are trying to replicate that movie 
theater experience” at home. Bigger screens helped, 
but they were heavy and difficult to mount on the 
wall of the family room or den. Also, the picture 
and motion quality were blurry. Samsung and other 
companies have worked to improve image quality 
on bigger screens. At the same time, larger TVs got 
lighter because they got flatter—some less than 
10 millimeters thick—and therefore easier to mount. 
That is partly due to LED backlights, which are 
thinner than the conventional fluorescent versions. 
LED backlights also use less energy.
In other TV technology developments, Samsung 
announced that it would make Blockbuster and 
Amazon on-demand, pay-per-view film services 
available in streaming content on some of its 
high-definition TVs, eliminating the need for a 
box on top of the set or a hardware connection 
to a personal computer. And with improved 
technology making 3-D movies more popular, 
Samsung introduced the first-ever high-definition 
3-D LED television.
Although Samsung and its rival LG Electronics 
share 30 percent of the mobile phone market, their 
portion of the smart phone market is only 5 percent. 
Samsung worked to catch up quickly, offering new 
touchscreen cell phones and new smart phones. Its 
Galaxy Spica smart phone now includes Google’s 
Android operating system. In addition, Apple signed 
a $240 million deal with Samsung for 3 million iPad 
display screens.
According to one market analyst, “Semiconductors 
will drive Samsung’s earnings this year . . . 
Consumer fever for Apple’s iPhone and new tablet 
product is likely to help Samsung’s chip business.”
The Environmental Protection Administration 
awarded Samsung its ENERGY STAR Promotion 
Award for its contributions to reducing greenhouse 
gases, efforts in consumer education, and promotion 
of energy-efficient devices. Buyers of its certified 
computer monitors saved about $48 in annual 
electricity costs. Samsung clothes washers helped 
users save more than 1 billion kilowatt hours in a 
recent year. Samsung’s Recycling Direct program 
processed more than 18 million pounds of electronic 
waste in 18 months.
Despite these successes, Samsung is well 
aware of the fierce competition from its rivals. 
Choi Gee-sung, the company’s chief executive, said, 
“Our competitors have strengthened their capability 
and some have completed restructuring. . . . They 
are racing ahead to rival us and this will 
increase competition and toughen our business 
outlook.”1

When we examine the exchanges that 
companies and societies make as a whole, we 
are focusing on the economic systems operating 
in different nations. These systems reflect 
the combination of policies and choices a 
nation makes to allocate resources among 
its citizens. Countries vary in the ways they 
allocate scarce resources.
Economics, which analyzes the choices 
people and governments make in allocating 
scarce resources, affects each of us, because 
everyone is involved in producing, distribut-
ing, or simply consuming goods and services. 
In fact, your life is affected by economics 
every day. When you decide what goods to 
buy, what services to use, or what activi-
ties to fit into your schedule, you are mak-
ing economic choices. Understanding how 
the activities of one industry affect those of 
other industries, and how they relate in the 
overall picture of a country, is an important 
part of understanding economics.
The choices you make actually may 
be international in scope. If you are in the 
market for a new car, you might visit several 
dealers in a row on the same street—Ford, 
Chrysler, Honda, Hyundai, and General 
Motors. You might decide on Hyundai—a 
Korean firm—but your car might very well 
be manufactured in the United States, using 
parts from all over the world. Although firms 
sometimes emphasize the American origin 
of their products in order to appeal to con-
sumers’ desire to support the U.S. economy, 
many items are made of components from a 
variety of nations.
Businesses and not-for-profit organiza-
tions also make economic decisions when 
they choose how to use human and natural 
resources; invest in equipment, machinery, 
and buildings; and form partnerships with 
other firms. Economists refer to the study 
of small economic units, such as individual 
consumers, families, and businesses, as 
microeconomics.
The study of a country’s overall eco-
nomic issues is called macroeconomics 
(macro means “large”). Macroeconomics 
addresses such issues as how an economy 
uses its resources and how government 
policies affect people’s standards of living. 
The substitution of ethanol for gasoline or 
biodiesel for diesel fuel has macroeconomic 
consequences—affecting many parts of the 
U.S. economy and suppliers around the 
world. Macroeconomics examines not just 
the economic policies of individual nations, 
but the ways in which those individual 
policies affect the overall world economy. 
Because so much business is conducted 
around the world, a law enacted in one 
country can easily affect a transaction that 
takes place in another country. Although 
macroeconomic issues have a broad scope, 
they help shape the decisions that individu-
als, families, and businesses make every day.
This chapter introduces economic 
theory and the economic challenges facing 
individuals, businesses, and governments 
in the global marketplace. We begin with 
the microeconomic concepts of supply and 
demand and their effect on the prices people 
pay for goods and services. Next we explain 
the various types of economic systems, along 
with tools for comparing and evaluating 
their performance. Then we examine the 
ways in which governments seek to manage 
economies to create stable business environ-
ments in their countries. The final section 
in the chapter looks at some of the driving 
economic forces currently affecting people’s 
lives.

Microeconomics: The Forces of 
Demand and Supply
Think about your own economic activities. You shop for groceries, subscribe 
to a cell phone service, pay college tuition, fill your car’s tank with gas. Now think 
about your family’s economic activities. When you were growing up, your parents 
might have owned a home or rented an apartment. You might have taken a family 
vacation. Your parents may have shopped at discount clubs or at local stores. Each 
of these choices relates to the study of microeconomics. They also help determine 
both the prices of goods and services and the amounts sold. Information about 
these activities is vital to companies because their survival and ability to grow 
depends on selling enough products priced high enough to cover costs and earn 
profits. The same information is important to consumers who must make purchase 
decisions based on prices and the availability of the goods and services they need.
At the heart of every business endeavor is an exchange between a buyer and 
a seller. The buyer recognizes that he or she needs or wants a particular good or 
service—whether it’s a hamburger or a haircut—and is willing to pay a seller for 
it. The seller requires the exchange in order to earn a profit and stay in business. 
So the exchange process involves both demand and supply. Demand refers to the 
willingness and ability of buyers to purchase goods and services at different prices. 
The other side of the exchange process is supply, the amount of goods and ser-
vices for sale at different prices. Understanding the factors that determine demand and sup-
ply, as well as how the two interact, can help you understand many actions and decisions of 
individuals, businesses, and government. This section takes a closer look at these concepts.
Factors Driving Demand
For most of us, economics amounts to a balance between what we want and what we 
can afford. Because of this dilemma, each person must choose how much money to save and 
how much to spend. We must also decide among all the goods and services competing for 
our attention. Suppose you wanted to purchase a smart phone. You’d have to choose from a 
variety of brands and models. You’d also have to decide where you wanted to go to buy one. 
After shopping around, you might decide you didn’t want a smart phone at all. Instead, you 
might purchase something else, or save your money.
Demand is driven by a number of factors that influence how people decide to spend 
their money, including price. It can be driven by consumer preferences. It may also be 
driven by outside circumstances or larger economic events. During the recent recession, 
the videogame industry—including portable players and consoles, software, and associated 
items—experienced an 8 percent decline in sales from a previous year. Nevertheless, the last 
several years were also the strongest for video game sales.2
Demand can also increase the availability of certain types of Web sites and services. 
Recognizing the enormous popularity of Google’s YouTube, and believing the demand would 
grow, networks NBC and Fox teamed up to launch an advertising-supported online video 
site, which provides programming from different entertainment companies. The site, called 
Hulu.com, offers full-length movies and television shows. It also hosts programming from 
NBC and Fox and shows from Sony and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Disney joined later.)3
demand willingness and 
ability of buyers to pur-
chase goods and services.
supply willingness and 
ability of sellers to provide 
goods and services.
You shop for groceries, subscribe to a cell 
phone service, pay college tuition, fill your car’s 
tank with gas. Each of these choices relates to 
the study of microeconomics. They also help 
determine the prices of goods and the amounts 
sold.

In general, as the price of a good or service goes up, people 
buy smaller amounts. In other words, as price rises, the quantity 
demanded declines. At lower prices, consumers are generally willing 
to buy more of a good. A demand curve is a graph of the amount 
of a product that buyers will purchase at different prices. Demand 
curves typically slope downward, meaning that lower and lower 
prices attract larger and larger purchases.
Gasoline provides a classic example of how demand curves work. 
The left side of Figure 3.1 shows a possible demand curve for the 
total amount of gasoline that people will purchase at different prices. 
The prices shown may not reflect the actual price in your location 
at this particular time, but they still demonstrate the concept. When 
gasoline is priced at $2.99 a gallon, drivers may fill up their tanks 
once or twice a week. At $3.39 a gallon, many of them start econo-
mizing. They may combine errands or carpool to work. So the quan-
tity of gasoline demanded at $3.39 a gallon is lower than the amount 
demanded at $2.99 a gallon. The opposite happens at $2.59 a gallon. 
More gasoline is sold at $2.59 a gallon than at $2.99 a gallon, as 
people opt to run more errands or take a weekend trip. However, as mentioned earlier, other 
factors may cause consumers to accept higher prices anyway. They may have made vacation 
plans in advance and do not want to cancel them. Or they may be required to drive to work 
every day.
Economists make a clear distinction between changes in the quantity demanded at 
various prices and changes in overall demand. A change in quantity demanded, such as the 
change that occurs at different gasoline prices, is simply movement along the demand curve. 
A change in overall demand, on the other hand, results in an entirely new demand curve. 
Businesses are constantly trying to make predictions about both kinds of demand, and a 
miscalculation can cause problems. In the case of gasoline, which is derived from crude oil, 
many factors come into play. One factor that is beginning to make a major impact is the 
investment in and development of alternative fuels such as biodiesel, wind, and solar power. 
If alternatives are developed and readily available, then demand for oil may level off. Another 
issue is the U.S. economy. When a downturn occurs, so does the demand for oil and other 
goods. But disruptions in energy sources have the opposite effect; political unrest in oil-rich 
nations such as Nigeria or extreme weather that takes refineries offline increase the demand 
for the oil that is available.4
We can illustrate how the increased demand for gasoline worldwide has created a new 
demand curve, as shown in Figure 3.1. The new demand curve shifts to the right of the 
old demand curve, indicating that overall demand has increased at every price. A demand 
curve can also shift to the left when the demand for a good or service drops. However, the 
demand curve still has the same shape.
Although price is the underlying cause of movement along a demand curve, many fac-
tors can combine to determine the overall demand for a product—that is, the shape and 
position of the demand curve. These influences include customer preferences and incomes, 
the prices of substitute and complementary items, the number of buyers in a market, and the 
strength of their optimism regarding the future. Changes in any of these factors produce a 
new demand curve.
Changes in household income also change demand. As consumers have more money 
to spend, firms can sell more products at every price. This means the demand curve has 
demand curve graph of 
the amount of a product 
that buyers will purchase at 
different prices.
Demand is driven by consumer tastes and preferences as well 
as by economic conditions. Consumers tend to fill up their gas 
tanks more frequently when the per-gallon price is low.

shifted to the right. When income shrinks, nearly everyone suffers, and the demand curve 
shifts to the left. High-end retailers like Nordstrom, Saks, and Neiman Marcus experienced 
a decrease in demand for their luxury goods, as consumers thought twice about buying 
designer handbags, shoes, and clothing. Meanwhile, discount retailers such as Walmart 
experienced an increase in sales, so their demand curve shifted a bit to the right.5 Table 3.1 
describes how a demand curve is likely to respond to each of these changes.
For a business to succeed, management must carefully monitor the factors that may 
affect demand for the goods and services it hopes to sell. Costco has free sampling stations 
throughout its stores where customers can try small portions of various foods prepared on 
site. This practice encourages customers to buy something in the department where they are 
sampling.

Factors Driving Supply
Important economic factors also affect supply, the willingness and ability of firms to 
provide goods and services at different prices. Just as consumers must decide about how to 
spend their money, businesses must decide what products to sell, and how.
Sellers would prefer to charge higher prices for their products. A supply curve shows 
the relationship between different prices and the quantities that sellers will offer for sale, 
regardless of demand. Movement along the supply curve is the opposite of movement along 
the demand curve. So as price rises, the quantity that sellers are willing to supply also rises. 
At progressively lower prices, the quantity supplied decreases. In Figure 3.2, a possible sup-
ply curve for gasoline shows that increasing prices for gasoline should bring increasing sup-
plies to market.
Businesses need certain inputs to operate effectively in producing their output. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 1, these factors of production include natural resources, capital, human 
resources, and entrepreneurship. Natural resources include 
land, building sites, forests, and mineral deposits. Capital 
refers to resources such as technology, tools, information, 
physical facilities, and financial capabilities. Human resources 
include the physical labor and intellectual inputs contributed 
by employees. Entrepreneurship is the willingness to take risks 
to create and operate a business. Factors of production play 
a central role in determining the overall supply of goods and 
services.
A change in the cost or availability of any of these inputs 
can shift the entire supply curve, either increasing or decreas-
ing the amount available at every price. If the cost of land 
increases, a firm might not be able to purchase the site for 
a more efficient manufacturing plant, which would lower 
production levels, shifting the supply curve to the left. But if 
the company finds a way to speed up the production process, 
allowing it to turn out more products with less labor, the 
change reduces the overall cost of the finished products, which 
shifts the supply curve to the right.
Table 3.2 summarizes how changes in various factors can affect the supply curve. 
Sometimes forces of nature can affect the supply curve. During a record-breaking freeze

between different prices 
and the quantities that

one recent January, a significant percentage of Florida’s citrus crop, including oranges and 
lemons, was severely damaged. Because the fruit could not be harvested and shipped, supply 
dropped. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that the next harvest could be the 
second lowest since 2000. The freeze could also affect the following year’s crop if trees are 
not able to flower in the spring. However, growers said that even the frozen fruit could still 
be used for juice.6
The agriculture industry has often experienced such shifts in the supply curve. As con-
sumers increase their demand for locally grown produce, more and more farmers in colder 
regions are extending the growing season by operating heated greenhouses to supply vege-
tables and fruits normally available only during the summer months. Winter farming—some 
of which is also organic—can boost rural economies by creating new jobs and bringing new 
income to a region. Paul Lorrain, a farmer in Lyman, Maine, operates greenhouses that 
yield about 300 pounds of produce per week between October and the beginning of May. 
He sells it to local restaurants, at a farmers market, and through a community food co-op. 
Lorrain says of the demand, “We have gone from not being able to give it away to not being 
able to grow enough.”7
How Demand and Supply Interact
Separate shifts in demand and supply have obvious effects on prices and the availabil-
ity of products. In the real world, changes do not alternatively affect demand and supply. 
Several factors often change at the same time—and they keep changing. Sometimes such 
changes in multiple factors cause contradictory pressures on prices and quantities. In other 
cases, the final direction of prices and quantities reflects the factor that has changed the 
most. Demand and supply can affect employment as well as products.
Figure 3.3 shows the interaction of both supply and demand curves for gasoline on a 
single graph. Notice that the two curves intersect at P. The law of supply and demand states 
that prices (P) are set by the intersection of the supply and demand curves. The point where 
the two curves meet identifies the equilibrium price, the prevailing market price at which 
you can buy an item.
If the actual market price differs from the equilibrium price, buyers and sellers tend to 
make economic choices that restore the equilibrium level. The price of gold hit a record high 
in December 2009, but when the Federal Reserve Bank raised 
interest rates and the dollar gained strength against the euro, 
gold prices fell. Investors always seem to return to gold as a 
safe standard, according to economists, and consumers who are 
intent on buying jewelry most likely will do so, but they may buy 
more or fewer pieces as the price of gold changes over time.8
In other situations, suppliers react to market forces by 
reducing prices. For a number of years, fast-food chains such 
as McDonald’s and Wendy’s attracted customers by offering 
everyday value menus and coupons. However, the recent eco-
nomic downturn has meant that people are more likely to eat 
at home and go out less, so the chains experienced a drop in 
profits. Competition among the chains, already strong, could 
grow even fiercer, depending on the length of the economic 
recovery.9 Included in that competition is the success of the 
Five Guys Burgers and Fries chain as the “Hit & Miss” feature 
discusses.

When his two oldest sons declared they were not going to col-
lege, Jerry Murrell supported their decision. To keep the boys close to 
home and employed, he and his wife, Janie, used the money intended 
for their tuition to open a hamburger take-out shop in Arlington, 
Virginia. From this small beginning, Five Guys and a Burger (named 
for Murrell’s five sons) grew to 570 franchises in the United States 
and Canada. All the Murrells’ sons eventually joined the company, 
which the family still owns and runs.
Very early, Murrell realized that in order to compete with the 
fast-food chains, Five Guys would have to concentrate on food. 
All the restaurants feature the same simple, red-and-white-tile 
décor. The meat for the burgers—80 percent lean—is always 
fresh, never frozen. Burgers are made to order, with a selection 
of 17 toppings. The buns are toasted on a grill for better taste, rather 
than in a bun toaster. The potatoes for the fries, which are cooked 
in peanut oil, all come from northern Idaho, where they grow more 
slowly. Because Five Guys insists on the highest-quality ingredients, 
its food prices change according to what the company pays 
its suppliers.
The family tried some experiments that failed, such as serving 
coffee and a chicken sandwich. Aside from a very few kinds of hot 
dogs, they have stayed with the original burger-and-fries formula that 
first brought them success.
The food-industry research firm Technomic named Five 
Guys the fastest growing chain for a recent year. That same year, 
the company took in an estimated $570 million—up 50 percent 
from the previous year. “We figure our best salesman is our 
customer,” Murrell says. “Treat that person right, he’ll walk out 
the door and sell for you.”

As pointed out earlier, the forces of demand and supply can be affected by a variety 
of factors. One important variable is the larger economic environment. The next section 
explains how macroeconomics and economic systems influence market forces and, ulti-
mately, demand, supply, and prices.
Macroeconomics: Issues for 
the Entire Economy
Every country faces decisions about how to best use the four basic factors of produc-
tion. Each nation’s policies and choices help determine its economic system. But the political, 
social, and legal environments differ in every country. So no two countries have exactly the 
same economic system. In general, however, these systems can be classified into three cat-
egories: private enterprise systems; planned economies; or combinations of the two, referred 
to as mixed economies. As business becomes an increasingly global undertaking, it is impor-
tant to understand the primary features of the various economic systems operating around 
the world.

Capitalism: The Private Enterprise System 
and Competition
Most industrialized nations operate economies based on the private enterprise system, also 
known as capitalism or a market economy. A private enterprise system rewards businesses for 
meeting the needs and demands of consumers. Government tends to favor a hands-off atti-
tude toward controlling business ownership, profits, and resource allocations. Instead, com-
petition regulates economic life, creating opportunities and challenges that businesspeople 
must handle to succeed.
The relative competitiveness of a particular industry is an important consideration for 
every firm because it determines the ease and cost of doing business within that industry. 
Four basic types of competition take shape in a private enterprise system: pure competition, 
monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. Table 3.3 highlights the main differ-
ences among these types of competition.
Pure competition is a market structure, like that of small-scale agriculture or fishing, 
in which large numbers of buyers and sellers exchange homogeneous products and no single 
participant has a significant influence on price. Instead, prices are set by the market as the 
forces of supply and demand interact. Firms can easily enter or leave a purely competitive 
market because no single company dominates. Also, in pure competition, buyers see little 
difference between the goods and services offered by competitors.
Fishing and agriculture are good examples of pure competition. The wheat grown and 
sold by one farmer in the Midwest is virtually identical to that sold by others. As rainfall and

temperatures affect the crop growth, the price for this commodity rises 
or falls according to the law of supply and demand. The same concept 
applies to the fishing industry gathering clams and mussels off the coast 
of New England. The region’s notorious “red tide” of algae sometimes 
contaminates part of the season’s supply of shellfish just when summer 
tourists want them the most—and prices skyrocket.
Monopolistic competition is a market structure, like that for 
retailing, in which large numbers of buyers and sellers exchange differ-
entiated (heterogeneous) products, so each participant has some control 
over price. Sellers can differentiate their products from competing offer-
ings on the basis of price, quality, or other features. In an industry that 
features monopolistic competition, it is relatively easy for a firm to begin 
or stop selling a good or service. The success of one seller often attracts 
new competitors to such a market. Individual firms also have some con-
trol over how their goods and services are priced.
One example of monopolistic competition is the market for 
pet food. Consumers can choose from private-label (store brands 
such as Walmart’s Ol’Roy) and brand-name products like Purina in 
bags, boxes, and cans. Producers of pet food and the stores that sell it 
have wide latitude in setting prices. Consumers can choose the store 
or brand with the lowest prices, or sellers can convince them that 
a more expensive offering, for example the Fromm brand, is worth 
more because it offers better nutrition, more convenience, or 
other benefits.
An oligopoly is a market situation in which relatively few sellers 
compete and high start-up costs form barriers to keep out new competi-
tors. In some oligopolistic industries, such as paper and steel, competi-
tors offer similar products. In others, such as aircraft and automobiles, 
they sell different models and features. The huge investment required to enter an oligopoly 
market tends to discourage new competitors. The limited number of sellers also enhances 
the control these firms exercise over price. Competing products in an oligopoly usually sell 
for very similar prices because substantial price competition would reduce profits for all 
firms in the industry. So a price cut by one firm in an oligopoly will typically be met by 
its competitors. However, prices can vary from one market to another, as from one country 
to another.
The final type of market structure is a monopoly, in which a single seller dominates 
trade in a good or service for which buyers can find no close substitutes. A pure monopoly 
occurs when a firm possesses unique characteristics so important to competition in its indus-
try that they serve as barriers to prevent entry by would-be competitors. After presiding over 
what many called monopolies in their respective areas, Microsoft and Google are expand-
ing into each other’s territory. Google launched Google Apps, an online suite of business 
applications, to compete with Microsoft’s Exchange Server. Meanwhile, Microsoft launched 
its own search engine, Bing. Later, Microsoft and Yahoo Inc. announced plans to team up 
to challenge Google’s domination of the Internet search market. The competition between 
Microsoft and Google may ultimately benefit consumers.10
Many firms create short-term monopolies when research breakthroughs permit them 
to receive exclusive patents on new products. In the pharmaceuticals industry, drug giants 
such as Merck and Pfizer invest billions in research and development programs. When 
the research leads to successful new drugs, the companies can enjoy the benefits of their 
monopolistic

Fishing is a good example of pure competition. Because 
clams gathered by one individual are virtually identical to 
those gathered by others, the price rises and falls with 
changes in supply and demand. Whenever a poisonous 
“red tide” of algae infests the clam beds off the coast of 
New England, the supply of fresh clams plummets and 
the price skyrockets.

patents: the ability to set prices without fear of competitors undercutting them. Once the 
patent expires, generic substitutes enter the market, driving down prices.
Because a monopoly market lacks the benefits of competition, many governments regu-
late monopolies. Besides issuing patents and limiting their life, the government prohibits 
most pure monopolies through antitrust legislation such as the Sherman Act and the Clayton 
Act. The U.S. government has applied these laws against monopoly behavior by Microsoft 
and by disallowing proposed mergers of large companies in some industries. In other cases, 
the government permits certain monopolies in exchange for regulating their activities.
With regulated monopolies, a local, state, or federal government grants exclusive 
rights in a certain market to a single firm. Pricing decisions—particularly rate-increase 
requests—are subject to control by regulatory authorities such as state public service com-
missions. An example is the delivery of first-class mail, a monopoly held by the U.S. Postal 
Service. The USPS is a self-supporting corporation wholly owned by the federal govern-
ment. Although it is no longer run by Congress, postal rates are set by a Postal Commission 
and approved by a Board of Governors.
During the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. government trended away from regulated monopo-
lies and toward deregulation. Regulated monopolies that have been deregulated include long-
distance and local telephone service, cable television, cell phones, and electric utilities. The 
idea is to improve customer service and reduce prices for customers through increased com-
petition. The Federal Communications Commission recently adopted a rule that bans cable 
operators from entering into exclusive agreements with owners of apartment buildings. This 
change will have an impact on the 30 percent of Americans who live in multiple-unit dwellings 
such as apartments, duplexes, and condominiums. Instead of being forced into a contract with 
one cable provider, residents of each apartment will have competitive choices. Phone compa-
nies such as AT&T and Verizon, which also offer cable service, are included in the rule.11

Planned Economies: Socialism and Communism
In a planned economy, government controls determine business ownership, profits, 
and resource allocation to accomplish government goals rather than those set by individual 
firms. Two forms of planned economies are communism and socialism.
Socialism is characterized by government ownership and operation of major 
industries such as communications. Socialists assert that major industries are too 
important to a society to be left in private hands and that government-owned businesses 
can serve the public’s interest better than private firms. However, socialism allows private 
ownership in industries considered less crucial to social welfare, such as retail shops, restau-
rants, and certain types of manufacturing facilities. Scandinavian countries such as Denmark, 
Sweden, and Finland have many socialist features in their societies, as do some African 
nations and India.
The writings of Karl Marx in the mid-1800s formed the basis of communist theory. 
Marx believed that private enterprise economies created unfair conditions and led to worker 
exploitation because business owners controlled most of society’s resources and reaped most 
of the economy’s rewards. Instead, he suggested an economic system called communism, in 
which all property would be shared equally by the people of a community under the direc-
tion of a strong central government. Marx believed that elimination of private ownership of 
property and businesses would ensure the emergence of a classless society that would benefit 
all. Each individual would contribute to the nation’s overall economic success, and resources 
would be distributed according to each person’s needs. Under communism, the central gov-
ernment owns the means of production, and the people work for state-owned enterprises. 
The government determines what people can buy because it dictates what is produced in the 
nation’s factories and farms.
Several nations adopted communist-like economic systems during the early 20th 
century in an effort to correct abuses they believed existed in their previous systems. 
In practice, however, these new governments typically gave less freedom of choice in 
regard to jobs and purchases. These governments might be best described as totalitarian 
socialism. These nations often made mistakes in allocating resources to compete in the 
growing global marketplace. Government-owned monopolies often suffer from 
inefficiency.
Consider the former Soviet Union, where large government bureaucracies controlled 
nearly every aspect of daily life. Shortages became chronic because producers had little or no 
incentive to satisfy customers. The quality of goods and services also suffered for the same 
reason. When Mikhail Gorbachev became the last president of the dying Soviet Union, he 
tried to improve the quality of Soviet-made products. Effectively shut out of trading in the 
global marketplace and caught up in a treasury-depleting arms race with the United States, 
the Soviet Union faced severe financial problems. Eventually, these events led to the collapse 
of Soviet communism and the breakup of the Soviet Union itself.
Today, communist-like systems exist in just a few countries, such as North Korea. By 
contrast, the People’s Republic of China has shifted toward a more market-oriented econ-
omy. The national government has given local government and individual plant managers 
more say in business decisions and has permitted some private businesses. Households now 
have more control over agriculture, in contrast to the collectivized farms introduced during 
an earlier era. In addition, Western products such as McDonald’s restaurants and Coca-Cola 
soft drinks are now part of Chinese consumers’ lives, and Chinese workers manufacture 
products for export to other countries.

Mixed Market Economies
Private enterprise systems and planned economies adopt basically opposite approaches 
to operating economies. In reality, though, many countries operate mixed market 
economies, economic systems that draw from both types of economies, to different 
degrees. In nations generally considered to have a private enterprise economy, government-
owned firms frequently operate alongside private enterprises. In the United States, programs 
like Medicare are government run.
France has blended socialist and free enterprise policies for hundreds of years. The 
nation’s energy production, public transportation, and defense industries are run as national-
ized industries, controlled by the government. Meanwhile, a market economy operates in 
other industries. Over the past two decades, the French government has loosened its reins 
on state-owned companies, inviting both competition and private investment into industries 
previously operated as government monopolies.
The proportions of private and public enterprise can vary widely in mixed economies, 
and the mix frequently changes. Dozens of countries have converted government-owned and 
operated companies into privately held businesses in a trend known as privatization. Even 
the United States has seen proposals to privatize everything from the postal service to Social 
Security.
Governments may privatize state-owned enterprises in an effort to raise funds and 
improve their economies. The objective is to cut costs and run the operation more effi-
ciently. For most of its existence, Air Canada was a state-owned airline. But in 1989 the air-
line became fully privatized, and in 2000 the firm acquired Canadian Airlines International, 
becoming the world’s tenth-largest international air carrier. Air Canada now maintains an 
extensive global network, with destinations in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, 
Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. It offers such amenities as à la 
carte pricing, personal entertainment systems in seat backs, and fold-flat beds for transatlan-
tic flights.12
Table 3.4 compares the alternative economic systems on the basis of ownership and 
management of enterprises, rights to profits, employee rights, and worker incentives.
Evaluating Economic 
Performance
Ideally, an economic system should provide two important benefits for its citizens: a sta-
ble business environment and sustained growth. In a stable business environment, the overall 
supply of needed goods and services is aligned with the overall demand for these items. No 
wild fluctuations in price or availability to complicate economic decisions. Consumers and 
businesses not only have access to ample supplies of desired products at affordable prices but 
also have money to buy the items they demand.
Growth is another important economic goal. An ideal economy incorporates steady 
change directed toward continually expanding the amount of goods and services produced 
from the nation’s resources. Growth leads to expanded job opportunities, improved wages, 
and a rising standard of living.

Eventually, we will run out of fossil fuels such as oil and coal. The development 
of alternative energy sources—solar, wind, ethanol, biodiesel, geothermal, and 
nuclear—could create thousands of new jobs, help revive the economy, and slow 
down global warming.
A study sponsored by American renewable-energy corporations 
urges Congress to enact a federal standard of 25 percent reliance on 
alternative energy by 2025. Supporters claim that a national Renewable 
Electricity Standard (RES) of 25 percent would create 
hundreds of thousands of jobs in renewable energy fields. China has 
now surpassed Denmark, Germany, Spain, and the United States to 
become the leading manufacturer of wind turbines. Don Furman of 
Iberdrola Renewables says, “Without a strong RES, the U.S. wind 
industry will see no net job growth, and will likely lose jobs to 
overseas competitors.”
Should we develop alternative energy sources to aid 
economic recovery and create jobs?
Summary
The United States is not alone in developing “green” energy sources. Several European countries 
along the North Sea have joined to create an environmentally clean “supergrid” that will get its energy 
from green sources in Scotland, Germany, and Norway, connected by a network of energy-efficient under-
sea cables.

new “green” jobs for Americans. Some energy sources—wind and 
solar power, for example—are renewable and sustainable.
2. Clean, renewable energy will help end America’s unsustainable 
dependence on foreign oil. Fossil fuels cause environmental destruction 
and their prices fluctuate.

could keep them the more energy-efficient, economical choice.
2. Alternative energy sources are still in early development. It will 
take more time—and costly research—before they become economical 
and viable on a national scale.
Should Alternative Energy Development Be Relied 
on to Create New Jobs?
expect recessions to give way to periods of economic recovery. The “Solving an Ethical 
Controversy” feature explores whether developing alternative sources of energy will create 
new jobs to stimulate the economy.
Both business decisions and consumer buying patterns differ at each stage of the busi-
ness cycle. In periods of economic prosperity, unemployment remains low, consumer con-
fidence about the future leads to more purchases, and businesses expand—by hiring more 
employees, investing in new technology, and making similar purchases—to take advantage of 
new opportunities.
As recent events show, during a recession—a cyclical economic contraction that lasts for 
six months or longer—consumers frequently postpone major purchases and shift buying pat-
terns toward basic, functional products carrying low prices. Businesses mirror these changes 
in the marketplace by slowing production, postponing expansion plans, reducing inventories, 
and often cutting the size of their workforces. During recessions, people facing layoffs and

depletions of household savings become much more conservative in their spending, postpon-
ing luxury purchases and vacations. They often turn to lower-priced retailers like Target, 
Kohl’s, and JC Penney for the goods they need. And they have sold cars, jewelry, and stocks 
to make ends meet. They also sold everything from old books to artwork to kitchenware on 
eBay.
If an economic slowdown continues in a downward spiral over an extended period of 
time, the economy falls into depression. Many Americans have grown up hearing stories 
about their great-grandparents who lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s, when 
food and other basic necessities were scarce and jobs were rare.
In the recovery stage of the business cycle, the economy emerges from recession and 
consumer spending picks up steam. Even though businesses often continue to rely on part-
time and other temporary workers during the early stages of a recovery, unemployment 
begins to decline as business activity accelerates and firms seek additional workers to meet 
growing production demands. Gradually, the concerns of recession begin to disappear, and 
consumers start eating out at restaurants, booking vacations, and purchasing new cars again.
Productivity and the Nation’s Gross Domestic Product
An important concern for every economy is productivity, the relationship between the 
goods and services produced in a nation each year and the inputs needed to produce them. 
In general, as productivity rises, so does an economy’s growth and the wealth of its citizens. 
In a recession, productivity stalls or even declines.
Productivity describes the relationship between the number of units produced and the 
number of human and other production inputs necessary to produce them. Productivity is a

ratio of output to input. When a constant amount of inputs generates increased outputs, an 
increase in productivity occurs.
Total productivity considers all inputs necessary to produce a specific amount of out-
puts. Stated in equation form, it can be written as follows:
Total Productivity
Output (goods or service

s produced)
Input (human /natural resources, capital)
Many productivity ratios focus on only one of the inputs in the equation: labor pro-
ductivity or output per labor-hour. An increase in labor productivity means that the same 
amount of work produces more goods and services than before. Many of the gains in U.S. 
productivity are attributed to technology, and in recent years the United States appears to be 
enjoying the fruits of technology and productivity.
Productivity is a widely recognized measure of a company’s efficiency. In turn, the total 
productivity of a nation’s businesses has become a measure of its economic strength and 
standard of living. Economists refer to this measure as a country’s gross domestic product 
(GDP)—the sum of all goods and services produced within its boundaries. The GDP is based 
on the per-capita output of a country—in other words, total national output divided by the 
number of citizens. As Figure 3.4 shows, only the European Union’s GDP exceeds that of 
the United States. China comes in a distant third.13
In the United States, GDP is tracked by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), a divi-
sion of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Current updates and historical data on the GDP 
are available at the BEA’s Web site (http://www.bea.gov).

Price-Level Changes
Another important indicator of an economy’s stability is the general level of prices. For 
the last 100 years, economic decision makers concerned themselves with inflation, rising 
prices caused by a combination of excess consumer demand and increases in the costs of raw 
materials, component parts, human resources, and other factors of production. The core 
inflation rate is the inflation rate of an economy after energy and food prices are removed. 
This measure is often an accurate prediction of the inflation rate that consumers, businesses, 
and other organizations can expect to experience during the near future.
Excess consumer demand generates what is known as demand-pull inflation while 
increases in the costs of factors of production generates cost-push inflation. America’s most 
severe inflationary period during the last half of the 20th century peaked in 1980, when general 
price levels jumped almost 14 percent in a single year. In extreme cases, an economy may expe-
rience hyperinflation—an economic situation characterized by soaring prices. This situation 
has occurred in South America, as well as in countries that once formed the Soviet Union.
Inflation devalues money as persistent price increases reduce the amount of goods and 
services people can purchase with a given amount of money. This is bad news for people 
whose earnings do not keep up with inflation, who live on fixed incomes, or who have most 
of their wealth in investments paying a fixed rate of interest. Inflation can be good news to 
people whose income is rising or those with debts at a fixed rate of interest. A homeowner 
with a fixed-rate mortgage during inflationary times is paying off that debt with money that 
is worth less and less each year. Over the past decade, inflation helped a strong stock market 
drive up the number of millionaires to more than 7.8 million.14 And because of inflation, 
being a millionaire does not make a person as rich as it once did. To live like a 1960s mil-
lionaire, you would need almost $7 million today.
When increased productivity keeps prices steady, it can have a major positive impact on 
an economy. In a low-inflation environment, businesses can make long-range plans

without the constant worry of sudden inflationary shocks. Low interest rates encourage firms 
to invest in research and development and capital improvements, both of which are likely to 
produce productivity gains. Consumers can purchase growing stocks of goods and services 
with the same amount of money, and low interest rates encourage major acquisitions such 
as new homes and autos. But there are concerns. The fluctuating cost of oil—which is used 
to produce many goods—is a continuing issue. Businesses need to raise prices to cover their 
costs. Also, smaller firms have gone out of business or have been merged with larger compa-
nies, reducing the amount of competition and increasing the purchasing power of the larger 
corporations. Business owners continue to keep a watchful eye on signs of inflation.
The opposite situation—deflation—occurs when prices continue to fall. In Japan, 
where deflation has been a reality for several years, shoppers pay less for a variety of products 
ranging from groceries to homes. While this situation may sound ideal to consumers, it can 
weaken the economy. For instance, industries such as housing and auto manufacturing need 
to maintain strong prices in order to support all the related businesses that depend on them.
Measuring Price Level Changes In the United States, the government 
tracks changes in price levels with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the 
monthly average change in prices of goods and services. The federal Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS) calculates the CPI monthly based on prices of a “market basket,” a compila-
tion of the goods and services most commonly purchased by urban consumers. Figure 3.5 
shows the categories included in the CPI market basket. Each month, BLS representatives

inflation, occurs when

Almost half of American workers are women, including working 
mothers. Regardless of income, all saw their economic status deterio-
rate during the recession. In a recent survey, although most women 
thought conditions would improve eventually, more than half of work-
ing mothers say they are working more hours just to meet basic needs.
In response to the demands of childcare and earning a living, 
many women have started their own businesses. After a career in the 
fashion industry, Tory Burch launched a successful design company. 
Learning from her own experience as a working mother, she later 
established the Tory Burch Foundation. Her research revealed some 
grim statistics: the majority of poor people in the United States are 
women. Having a child is one of the leading factors when a woman’s 
income falls below the cost of living. Single mothers are most likely to 
be self-employed—but are also in the greatest danger of poverty.
Inspired by microloan organizations in the developing world, Burch 
formed a partnership with ACCION USA, a microlender in the United 
States. At $500 to $50,000, ACCION USA’s loans are somewhat larger 
than those in developing nations, but many have the same purpose: 
“to economically empower women.” Their clients have low to moder-
ate incomes and are more likely to be rejected by traditional banks, 
so these microloans are essential to their success. Forty percent are 
women, and more than 80 percent are members of minority groups. 
ACCION USA reports that more than 90 percent of these microloans 
have been repaid.
Burch says, “I like microfinance . . . because it isn’t charity in the 
traditional sense. . . . It gives entrepreneurs the opportunities many of 
us take for granted, and it is sustainable. . . . It’s also incredibly impor-
tant to the economic recovery of our country.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Why might having a baby cause a single mother’s income 
to fall?
2. Why do you think that the payback rate on microloans is 
so high?

visit thousands of stores, service establishments, rental units, and doctors’ offices all over the 
United States to price the multitude of items in the CPI market basket. They compile the 
data to create the CPI. Thus, the CPI provides a running measurement of changes in con-
sumer prices.
Employment Levels People need money to buy the goods and services produced 
in an economy. Because most consumers earn that money by working, the number of people 
in a nation who currently have jobs is an important indicator of how well the economy is 
doing. In general, employment has been on the rise in the United States the past few years, 
although there have been some dips. Areas that have seen gains include professional and 
technical services, as well as education, healthcare, and social assistance.15 The “Hit & Miss” 
feature discusses a foundation that helps working women and their families.
Economists refer to a nation’s unemployment rate as an indicator of its economic 
health. The unemployment rate is usually expressed as a percentage of the total workforce 
actively seeking work but are currently unemployed. The total labor force includes all people 
who are willing and available to work at the going market wage, whether they currently have 
jobs or are seeking work. The U.S. Department of Labor, which tracks unemployment rates, 
also measures so-called discouraged workers. These individuals want to work but have given 
up looking for jobs, for various reasons. Unemployment can be grouped into the four cat-
egories shown in Figure 3.6: frictional, seasonal, cyclical, and structural.
Frictional unemployment applies to members of the workforce who are temporarily 
not working but are looking for jobs. This pool of potential workers includes new graduates, 
people who have left jobs for any reason and are looking for other employment, and former 
workers who have decided to return to the labor force. Seasonal unemployment

is the joblessness of people in a seasonal 
industry. Construction workers, farm laborers, 
fishing boat operators, and landscape employees 
may contend with bouts of seasonal 
unemployment when wintry conditions make 
work unavailable.
Cyclical unemployment includes people 
who are out of work because of a cyclical 
contraction in the economy. During periods of 
economic expansion, overall employment is likely 
to rise, but as growth slows and a recession begins, 
unemployment levels commonly rise. At such 
times, even workers with good job skills may face 
temporary unemployment. Workers in high-tech 
industries, air travel, and manufacturing have all 
faced unemployment during economic 
contraction.
Structural unemployment applies to people 
who remain unemployed for long periods of time, 
often with little hope of finding new jobs like 
their old ones. This situation may arise because 
these workers lack the necessary skills for available 
jobs or because the skills they have are no longer 
in demand. For instance, technological develop-
ments have increased the demand for people with 
computer-related skills but have created structural 
unemployment among many types of manual labor-
ers or workers who may have been injured and unable to 
return to work.
Managing the Economy’s 
Performance
Government can use both monetary policy and fiscal policy in its efforts to fight unem-
ployment, increase business and consumer spending, and reduce the length and severity 
of economic recessions. For instance, the Federal Reserve System can increase or reduce 
interest rates, and the federal government can enact tax cuts and rebates, or propose other 
reforms.
Monetary Policy
A common method of influencing economic activity is monetary policy, government 
actions to increase or decrease the money supply and change banking requirements 
and interest rates to influence spending by altering bankers’ willingness to make loans.

An expansionary monetary policy 
increases the money supply in an effort 
to cut the cost of borrowing, which 
encourages business decision mak-
ers to make new investments, in turn 
stimulating employment and economic 
growth. By contrast, a restrictive 
monetary policy reduces the money 
supply to curb rising prices, overexpan-
sion, and concerns about overly rapid 
economic growth.
In the United States, the Federal 
Reserve System (“the Fed”) is respon-
sible for formulating and implement-
ing the nation’s monetary policy. It 
is headed by a chairman and board of 
governors, all of whom are nominated 
by the president. The current chairman 
is Ben Bernanke, who also serves as 
chairman of the Federal Open Market 
Committee, the Fed’s main agency for 
monetary policymaking. All national 
banks must be members of this system and keep some percentage of their checking and sav-
ings funds on deposit at the Fed.
The Fed’s board of governors uses a number of tools to regulate the economy. By 
changing the required percentage of checking and savings accounts that banks must deposit 
with the Fed, the governors can expand or shrink funds available to lend. The Fed also 
lends money to member banks, which in turn make loans at higher interest rates to business 
and individual borrowers. By changing the interest rates charged to commercial banks, the 
Fed affects the interest rates charged to borrowers and, consequently, their willingness to 
borrow.
Fiscal Policy
Governments also influence economic activities by making decisions about taxes and 
spending. Through revenues and expenses, the government implements fiscal policy. This 
is the second technique that officials use to control inflation, reduce unemployment, improve 
the general standard of living, and encourage economic growth. Increased taxes may restrict 
economic activities, while lower taxes and increased government spending usually boost 
spending and profits, cut unemployment rates, and fuel economic expansion. On some occa-
sions, the U.S. federal government has issued tax rebates to its citizens and businesses in an 
effort to stimulate investment and spending. The “Going Green” feature discusses federal 
tax credits for energy-efficient products.
International Fiscal Policy Nations in the industrial world, including the 
United States, are currently struggling to find ways to help developing nations modernize 
their economies. One proposal is to forgive the debts of some of these countries, particularly

those in Africa, to stimulate their economies to grow. But not all fiscal experts agree 
with this idea. They suggest that any debt forgiveness should come with certain conditions 
so that these countries can build their own fiscal policies. Countries should encourage and 
allow citizens to own property, lower their tax rates, avoid devaluing their currencies, lay a 
path for new businesses to start, and reduce trade barriers. In addition, they must improve 
agriculture, education, and health care so their citizens can begin to set and reach financial 
goals. The World Bank is an organization that offers such programs as low-interest loans 
and interest-free credit and grants to developing countries. The World Bank has been 
involved in helping Haiti recover from the catastrophic earthquake of 2010.16
The Federal Budget Each year, the president proposes a budget for the fed-
eral government, a plan for how it will raise and spend money during the coming year, and 
presents it to Congress for approval. A typical federal budget proposal undergoes months of 
deliberation and many modifications before receiving approval. The federal budget includes a 
number of different spending categories, ranging from defense and Social Security to 
interest payments on the national debt. The decisions about what to include in the budget 
have a direct effect on various sectors of the economy. During a recession, the federal 
government may approve increased spending on interstate highway repairs to improve 
transportation and increase employment in the construction industry. During prosperity, the 
government may allocate more money for scientific research toward medical breakthroughs 
or alternative fuels.

Tax Credits for an Energy Star
To encourage Americans to save energy and reduce pollution, 
the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) launched the 
“ENERGY STAR” program in 1992. Later, the Energy Department and 
the EPA began granting makers of appliances and building materials 
the familiar ENERGY STAR seal if their products met federal standards 
for energy efficiency. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009 revised a program begun earlier that awards federal income-tax 
credits to consumers who buy these products. The stimulus package 
also contains funds for rebates to consumers who buy new, ENERGY 
STAR–qualified appliances. Each U.S. state and territory has devel-
oped its own rebate plan.
Hybrid gas-electric vehicles and those using alternative fuels are 
eligible for tax credits, as are plug-in electric vehicles. You can also 
get a tax credit equivalent to 10 percent of the cost if you convert a 
conventional vehicle to a plug-in, electric-drive motor.
In the state-administered rebate program, replacing certain appli-
ances with qualified ones will not only get you a rebate but will also 
lower your utility bills. Depending on climate, geography, and other 
factors, your state may choose from among boilers, central or room 
air conditioners, washing machines, dishwashers, freezers, oil and gas 
furnaces, heat pumps (air source and geothermal), refrigerators, and 
water heaters.
Certain kinds of home improvements are eligible for tax credits. 
You might invest in a new, qualified central air-conditioning system, 
heat pump, or furnace. If you live in a cold climate, you might 
choose to insulate or seal your windows. You might install a 
biomass stove that burns agricultural and wood waste, plants and 
residues, or wood pellets. Not only will you get a tax credit, you will 
also see long-run savings on your fuel bill and help protect the 
environment.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How will paying out rebates and granting tax credits stim-
ulate the economy?
2. Which would you prefer to receive—an income-tax credit 
or a rebate? Why?

The primary sources of government funds to cover the costs of the annual budget are 
taxes, fees, and borrowing. Both the overall amount of these funds and their specific 
combination have major effects on the economic well-being of the nation. One way govern-
ments raise money is to impose taxes on sales, income, and other sources. But increasing 
taxes leaves people and businesses with less money to spend. This might reduce inflation, but 
overly high taxes can also slow economic growth. Governments then try to balance taxes to 
give people necessary services without slowing economic growth.
Taxes don’t always generate enough funds to cover every spending project the govern-
ment hopes to undertake. When the government spends more than the amount of money it 
raises through taxes, it creates a budget deficit. To cover the deficit, the U.S. government 
borrows money by selling Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds to investors. 
All of this borrowing makes up the national debt. If the government takes in more money 
than it spends, it is said to have a budget surplus. A balanced budget means total rev-
enues raised by taxes equal the total proposed spending for the year.
Achieving a balanced budget—or even a budget surplus—does not erase the 
national debt. U.S. legislators continually debate how fast the nation should use revenues 
to reduce its debt. Most families want to wipe out debt—from credit cards, automobile 
purchases, and college, to name a few sources. To put the national debt into personal 
perspective, with roughly 308 million U.S. citizens, each one owes about $40,260 as his 
or her share.
But for the federal government, the decision is more complex. When the government 
raises money by selling Treasury bills, it makes safe investments available to investors world-
wide. If foreign investors cannot buy Treasury notes, they might turn to other countries, 
reducing the amount of money flowing into the United States. U.S. government debt has 
also been used as a basis for pricing riskier investments. If the government issues less debt, 
the interest rates it commands are higher, raising the overall cost of debt to private borrow-
ers. In addition, the government uses the funds from borrowing, at least in part, to invest in 
such public services as education and scientific research.
Global Economic Challenges 
of the 21st Century
Businesses face a number of important economic challenges in the 21st century. As 
the economies of countries around the globe become increasingly interconnected, govern-
ments and businesses must compete throughout the world. Although no one can predict the 
future, both governments and businesses will likely need to meet several challenges to main-
tain their global competitiveness. Table 3.5 identifies five key challenges: (1) the economic 
impact of the continuing threat of international terrorism, (2) the shift to a global informa-
tion economy, (3) the aging of the world’s population, (4) the growth of China and India, 
and (5) efforts to enhance the competitiveness of every country’s workforce.
No country is an economic island in today’s global economy. Not only is an ever-
increasing stream of goods and services crossing national borders, but a growing number of 
businesses have become true multinational firms, operating manufacturing plants and other 
facilities around the world. As global trade and investments grow, events in one nation can

reverberate around the globe. The “Business 
Etiquette” feature offers some tips for interna-
tional travel.
Despite the risks of world trade, global expan-
sion can offer huge opportunities to U.S. firms. 
With U.S. residents accounting for just over 1 in 
every 22 of the world’s nearly 7 billion people, 
growth-oriented American companies cannot 
afford to ignore the world market.17 U.S. busi-
nesses also benefit from the lower labor costs in 
other parts of the world, and some are finding 
successful niches importing goods and services 
provided by foreign firms. Still, it is extremely 
important for U.S. firms to keep track of the for-
eign firms that supply their products. When it 
became apparent that some plastic toys supplied 
to U.S. toymakers by Chinese manufacturers con-
tained lead paint that could be harmful to chil-
dren, the U.S. firms issued massive recalls of these 
toys. A subsequent investigation by the Associated 
Press revealed that some Chinese manufacturers 
had substituted cadmium, another soft metal, for 
lead in children’s jewelry sold in the United States. 
Cadmium is known to cause cancer. Like lead, 
it impairs brain development in young children. 
Federal and state agencies warned Asian firms not 
to use other toxic substances in place of lead and 
began investigating products sold in America that 
might contain cadmium or other toxic heavy met-
als. Inez Tenenbaum, the chairwoman of the U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission, said, “All 
of us should be committed to keeping hazardous 
or toxic levels of heavy metals out of . . . toys and 
children’s products. . . . Voluntary efforts will only 
take us so far.”18
U.S. firms must also develop strategies for 
competing with each other overseas. In the huge 
but fragmented beverage industry, Coca-Cola still 
edges out Pepsi as the top-selling cola worldwide. 
Industry experts predict that China will be the 
next great battleground for the two soda giants. 
Coca-Cola still maintains better name recognition, 
but Pepsi is closing in.19
Tips for International Travel
Good manners and good communication have always been important in 
business and are becoming even more crucial as global business increases. If 
your work takes you to a foreign country—or even to an international 
videoconference—it is essential for you to understand the manners and 
etiquette of the place you are visiting, either actually or virtually.
Here are some useful tips for international business travel, based on 
suggestions by Dana Persia of DP Image Consulting.
Before Leaving
1 
Do as much research as you can on the business etiquette and customs 
of the country you will visit. Travel guides—and, of course, the Internet, 
especially the U.S. State Department Web site—can be very helpful.
2 If the native language is not English, learn a few important phrases. Your 
hosts will appreciate the effort, even if your pronunciation is less than 
perfect.
3 
Compare American business and casual dress with what is appropriate in 
the country you are visiting. Standards of modesty for women are stricter 
in many countries. In general, try to ﬁ t in as best you can.
Getting There
1 
If possible, arrive enough in advance to adapt to time-zone changes, 
especially before an important conference or meeting.
2 
Be sure to get enough sleep before you travel to help mitigate the effects

What’s Ahead
Global competition is a key factor in today’s economy. In Chapter 4, we focus on the 
global dimensions of business. We cover basic concepts of doing business internationally and 
examine how nations can position themselves to benefit from the global economy. Then we 
describe the specific methods used by individual businesses to expand beyond their national 
borders and compete successfully in the global marketplace.
Summary of Learning Objectives
Distinguish between microeconomics and macroeconom-
ics. Explain the factors that drive demand and supply.
Microeconomics is the study of economic behavior among 
individual consumers, families, and businesses whose col-
lective behavior in the marketplace determines the quantity 
of goods and services demanded and supplied at different 
prices. Macroeconomics is the study of the broader eco-
nomic picture and how an economic system maintains and 
allocates its resources; it focuses on how a government’s 
monetary and fiscal policies affect the overall operation of an 
economic system.
Demand is the willingness and ability of buyers to pur-
chase goods and services at different prices. Factors that 
drive demand for a good or service include customer prefer-
ences, the number of buyers and their incomes, the prices 
of substitute goods, the prices of complementary goods, and

consumer expectations about the future. Supply is the will-
ingness and ability of businesses to offer products for sale at 
different prices. Supply is determined by the cost of inputs 
and technology resources, taxes, and the number of suppliers 
operating in the market. 
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 Define microeconomics and macroeconomics. 
Microeconomics is the study of economic behavior among 
individual consumers, families, and businesses whose col-
lective behavior in the marketplace determines the quantity 
of goods and services demanded and supplied at different 
prices. Macroeconomics is the study of the broader economic 
picture and how an economic system maintains and allocates 
its resources.
1.2 Explain demand and supply curves. A demand curve 
is a graph of the amount of a product that buyers will pur-
chase at different prices. A supply curve shows the relation-
ship between different prices and the quantities that sellers 
will offer for sale, regardless of demand.
1.3 How do factors of production influence the 
overall supply of goods and services? A change in the 
cost or availability of any of the inputs considered to be 
factors of production can shift the entire supply curve, 
either increasing or decreasing the amount available at 
every price.
Describe each of the four different types of market struc-
tures in a private enterprise system, and compare the 
three major types of economic systems.
Four basic models characterize competition in a private 
enterprise system: pure competition, monopolistic competi-
tion, oligopoly, and monopoly. Pure competition is a market 
structure, like that in small-scale agriculture, in which large 
numbers of buyers and sellers exchange homogeneous prod-
ucts and no single participant has a significant influence on 
price. Monopolistic competition is a market structure, like 
that of retailing, in which large numbers of buyers and sellers 
exchange differentiated products, so each participant has some 
control over price. Oligopolies are market situations, like those 
in the steel and airline industries, in which relatively few sellers 
compete and high start-up costs form barriers to keep out new 
competitors. In a monopoly, one seller dominates trade in a 
good or service, for which buyers can find no close substitutes.
The major economic systems are private enterprise econ-
omy, planned economy (such as communism or socialism), and 
mixed market economy. In a private enterprise system, indi-
viduals and private businesses pursue their own interests—
including investment decisions and profits—without undue 
governmental restriction. In a planned economy, the govern-
ment exerts stronger control over business ownership, profits, 
and resources to accomplish governmental and societal—
rather than individual—goals. Socialism, one type of planned 
economic system, is characterized by government owner-
ship and operation of all major industries. Communism is an 
economic system without private property; goods are owned 
in common, and factors of production and production deci-
sions are controlled by the state. A mixed market economy 
blends government ownership and private enterprise, com-
bining characteristics of both planned and private enterprise 
economies.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 What is the difference between pure competition 
and monopolistic competition? Pure competition is a mar-
ket structure in which large numbers of buyers and sellers 
exchange homogeneous products. Monopolistic competition 
is a market structure in which large numbers of buyers and 
sellers exchange differentiated products.
2.2 On which economic system is the U.S. economy 
based? The U.S. economy is based on the private enterprise 
system.
2.3 What is privatization? Privatization is the conversion 
of government-owned and operated agencies into privately 
held businesses.
Identify and describe the four stages of the business cycle. 
Explain how productivity, price level changes, and employ-
ment levels affect the stability of a nation’s economy.
The four stages are prosperity, recession, depression, and 
recovery. Prosperity is characterized by low unemployment 
and strong consumer confidence. In a recession, consumers 
often postpone major purchases, layoffs occur, and house-
hold savings may be depleted. A depression occurs when an 
economic slowdown continues in a downward spiral over a 
long period of time. During recovery, consumer spending 
begins to increase and business activity accelerates, leading 
to an increased number of jobs.
As productivity rises, so do an economy’s growth and 
the wealth of its citizens. In a recession, productivity 
stalls or possibly declines. Changes in general price levels—
inflation or deflation—are important indicators of an 
economy’s general stability. The U.S. government 
measures price-level changes by the Consumer Price 
Index. A nation’s unemployment rate is an indicator of 
both overall stability and growth. The unemployment 
rate shows, as a percentage of the total labor force, the 
number of people actively seeking employment who are 
unable to find jobs.

3.1 Describe the four stages of the business cycle. The 
four stages are prosperity, recession, depression, and recov-
ery. Prosperity is characterized by low unemployment and 
strong consumer confidence. Recession may include con-
sumers postponing major purchases, layoffs, and decreased 
household savings. A depression occurs when an economic

slowdown continues in a downward spiral over a long period 
of time. In recovery, consumer spending increases and busi-
ness activity accelerates.
3.2 What are some measures that economists use to 
determine the health of an economy? Gross domestic 
product (GDP), general level of prices, core inflation rate, 
the Consumer Price Index, and the unemployment rate 
are all measures used to determine the health of an 
economy.
Discuss how monetary policy and fiscal policy are 
used to manage an economy’s performance.
Monetary policy encompasses a government’s efforts to 
control the size of the nation’s money supply. Various 
methods of increasing or decreasing the overall money 
supply affect interest rates and therefore affect borrowing 
and investment decisions. By changing the size of the 
money supply, government can encourage growth or 
control inflation. Fiscal policy involves decisions 
regarding government revenues and expenditures. Changes 
in government spending affect economic growth and 
employment levels in the private sector. However, a 
government must also raise money, through taxes or bor-
rowing, to finance its expenditures. Because tax payments 
represent funds that might otherwise have been spent by 
individuals and businesses, any taxation changes also affect 
the overall economy.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 What is the difference between an expansionary 
monetary policy and a restrictive monetary policy? An 
expansionary monetary policy increases the money supply 
in an effort to cut the cost of borrowing. A restrictive mon-
etary policy reduces the money supply to curb rising prices, 
overexpansion, and concerns about overly rapid economic 
growth.
4.2 What are the three primary sources of government 
funds? The U.S. government acquires funds through taxes, 
fees, and borrowing.
4.3 Does a balanced budget erase the federal debt? No, 
a balanced budget does not erase the national debt; it just 
doesn’t increase it.
Describe the major global economic challenges of the 21st 
century.
Businesses face five key challenges in the 21st century: (1) 
the threat of international terrorism; (2) the shift to a global 
information economy; (3) the aging of the world’s popula-
tion; (4) the growth of India and China, which compete for 
resources; and (5) efforts to enhance the competitiveness of 
every country’s workforce.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 Why is virtually no country an economic island 
these days? No business or country is an economic island 
because many goods and services travel across national bor-
ders. Companies now are becoming multinational firms.
5.2 Describe two ways in which global expansion can 
benefit a U.S. firm. A firm can benefit from global expan-
sion by attracting more customers and using less expensive 
labor and production to produce goods and services.

Case 3.1
Nuclear Energy: Making a Comeback?
In the 2010 State of the Union address, the presi-
dent called for more clean-energy jobs, with expansion 
of nuclear power as an alternative energy source. He 
declared, “To create more of these clean energy jobs, we 
need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. 
And that means building a new generation of safe, clean 
nuclear power plants in this country.”
Other countries, such as Great Britain, are already 
planning to build new nuclear plants. Although none have 
been built in the United States for many years, the 104 
currently operating plants generate almost 20 percent of 
America’s electricity. Wind and solar energy together gen-
erate less than 5 percent.
An alloy of enriched uranium powers nuclear reactors. 
How large is the world’s supply of uranium? How long will 
it last?
Uranium, a metal, is relatively common and can be 
found in rocks and even seawater as well as in ore deposits 
in the earth. With 24 percent, Australia has the largest sup-
ply overall, but Kazakhstan recently declared that it had sur-
passed Australia’s output. Canada has less than 10 percent 
of the world’s supply, but has the highest concentration of 
top-quality ore. Worldwide, about 67,00 tons of uranium are 
used each year. At current demand, that supply is expected 
to last about 70 years. The World Nuclear Association 
(WNA) predicts that nuclear reactor capacity will increase by 
about 27 percent in the next decade and that the demand 
for uranium will grow by 33 percent in response.
There is some debate about when the demand for 
uranium will be greater than the supply that can be mined 
economically. Antinuclear activists point out that mineral 
resources are nonrenewable. Just as the world will eventually 
run out of oil and coal, it will also run out of uranium. Some 
analysts believe that this will happen sooner rather than later.
Environmentalists object to destructive mining tech-
niques. In Australia, activists are concerned with the land 
rights of indigenous Australians. Another potential road-
block is that uranium mining in general is impeded by a lack 
of infrastructure and a shortage of experienced workers, fac-
tors that drive up processing costs. And, a still-unsolved and 
crucial problem is how to manage safe, long-term storage 
of spent nuclear rods, which continue to emit radioactivity.
The World Nuclear Association disagrees with these 
assessments. First, not all uranium deposits have been discov-
ered. Since 1975, the number of known deposits has tripled. 
Advances in geological research and more exploration will 
detect many more. As mining techniques improve, known 
deposits that are currently unreachable will become economi-
cally accessible. The WNA predicts that at current rates of usage, 
known supplies will last 200 years rather than 70 or 80.
Second, ore deposits are not the only sources of uranium. 
It is also found in nuclear weapons, available because of vari-
ous disarmament treaties. The end of the Cold War in the late 
1980s also meant the end of the nuclear arms race. Nuclear 
warheads contain high-quality enriched uranium. Utility com-
panies and governments also have stockpiles of the metal.

101
Chapter 3  Economic Challenges Facing Contemporary Business
Third, research is ongoing to make enrichment facili-
ties and reactors more energy efficient.
Fourth, unlike oil or coal, uranium can be recycled 
from spent nuclear fuel rods and from tailings (uranium 
left over from the enrichment process). These techniques 
should also improve over time. Other sources, such as 
phosphates and seawater, could become economically 
viable in the future.
Questions for Critical Thinking

Smart Phones: Recession Proof and Growing
Case 3.2
The ascent of the smart phone has been one of the 
most revolutionary developments in electronics. Among the 
many models available are the the Nokia N900, the Apple 
iPhone, Research in Motion’s BlackBerry, the Palm Treo, 
and the Motorola Droid, with others in the works. Microsoft 
is planning to launch smart phone software to rival Apple’s.
Despite the recent recession, smart phones have 
remained wildly popular in the United States and abroad. 
The numbers are staggering. In one recent quarter, 53 
million smart phones were shipped worldwide. Nokia led 
the global market with almost 40 percent of market share. 
The BlackBerry was second, with just over 20 percent. The 
iPhone was third, with over 16 percent. Other smart phones 
had a combined market share of just over 24 percent.
Competition among the smart phones will almost cer-
tainly remain strong and is likely to become stronger. Two 
influential factors are coverage and applications.
The new Droid from Motorola is giving the iPhone a 
run for its money. The Droid runs on the Verizon network, 
whereas AT&T has exclusive rights to the iPhone. Verizon 
has wider network coverage than AT&T, but AT&T allows 
iPhone users to multitask on one handset. At present, pro-
spective buyers must choose between quality of coverage 
and multitasking. The coverage issue may become moot, 
however, because some predict that Apple may soon unlock 
the iPhone, and AT&T will no longer be the sole carrier.
In applications, or “apps,” the iPhone has far sur-
passed any other smart phone. It leads in number of app 
developers, number of apps, and number of people who 
have downloaded those apps. Applications number in the 
hundreds of thousands; Apple alone has 75,000. Most are 
free; others (about 18 percent) cost just a few dollars. Apps 
range from weather to games to music to news. A typical 
user downloads 20 apps, with games far in the lead. Apple 
recently celebrated its one-billionth iPhone download.
Here are some predictions for the smart phone 
industry:
 
• Some analysts forecast that sales of smart phones 
will increase four-fold by 2013, and fees for smart 
phone apps in the United States alone will increase 
ten-fold to $4.2 billion. As they grow ever more 
powerful and more versatile, smart phones could 
very well replace laptops in the future.
 • Smart phones will account for an increasing share of 
the mobile-phone market. In a recent year, 1.2 billion 
mobile phones were shipped worldwide; of these, 
190 million were smart phones. That percentage is 
expected to rise.
 • As we have seen, application stores will experience 
a boom. The iPhone already has plenty of games, 
so analysts suggest app writers should develop 
other types of software, such as business apps. The 
BlackBerry has plenty of business applications, so 
writers should develop more games.
 • Location-based services, which already include GPS, 
will increase. Droid users can download step-by-step 
spoken directions via Google. You’ll be able to use your 
smart phone to trace a package or find your friends so 
you can meet for a movie. Advertisers may be able to 
have pop-up ads on the maps you download.
Manufacturers are expected to launch other devices 
in addition to smart phones. Some are already available.

Secret Acres:  Selling Comics Is Serious Business
CASE 1.3
Case 3.3
Just about everyone remembers a favorite comic book 
from childhood—whether it was Spiderman, Tin Tin, or even 
Garfield. Leon Avelino and Barry Matthews readily acknowl-
edge that they are kids in grown-up bodies with real day 
jobs (Avelino works for Sports Illustrated and Matthews is an 
accountant for an e-commerce firm) who happen to love 
comic books and their latest incarnation, graphic novels. 
Their love for comics in all forms—along with the desire to 
start their own business—led them to found Secret Acres, 
a comic book and graphic novel publisher based in New 
York City. In addition to publishing several works from up-
and-coming authors (they have eight books on their list so 
far), the Secret Acres duo sells books from independent dis-
tributors. Often asked whether they think Secret Acres will 
succeed or fail in the next few years, Avelino quips, “People 
think we’re too small to fail anyway.” He laughs but then 
adds, “That pisses me off. I think we can totally fail.”
But Avelino and Matthews have no intention of 
failing. Acknowledging that Secret Acres faces many eco-
nomic challenges if it’s going to hang on and eventually 
succeed, Matthews observes, “Every decision we make, 
we know what the outcome is going to be because it’s all 
small and it’s very close to us.” Right now, Secret Acres 
can use its small size to build relationships with its cus-
tomers. “We are able, because we’re small, to produce a 
very specific kind of comic book, a specific kind of graphic 
novel, that appeals to a specific audience,” explains 
Matthews. “I love that. We have a lot of control over what 
we do and we’re not doing anything specifically to turn a 
buck.” That said, the accountant in Matthews knows that 
in order to stay in business, Secret Acres must sell enough 
books to push unit costs down, keeping production 
expenses and prices as low as possible.
Matthews also refers to relationships with book 
stores, which are personal because he and Avelino do all 
the communicating themselves. “When you have a small 
group of stores you are selling from, you have to col-
lect from them on a one-to-one basis,” says Matthews. 
Sometimes the relationship becomes awkward when 
Matthews or Avelino has to remind a book store owner 
personally of an unpaid balance.
Another challenge facing the duo is the uncertain 
future of the print publishing market. The introduction of 
e-readers such as Amazon’s Kindle and Barnes & Noble’s 
Nook creates a new delivery system for printed work. 
While the e-reader hasn’t created the sensation among 
consumers that its manufacturers had hoped (some 
competing models have already disappeared from the 
marketplace), online delivery of printed matter is alive 
and well—and it’s likely that some form of e-reader will 
eventually catch on. “Publishers are nervous because no 
one knows how popular e-readers will be in the long run,” 
says Matthews. 
Another phenomenon that has taken hold over the 
last decade is the graphic novel, the fiction genre that 
combines comic book techniques with the longer, more 
complex structure of a novel. Graphic novels are particu-
larly popular among teens and college students, but they 
have received serious attention from the literary world. 
College courses are now taught around the graphic novel, 
and the American Library Association publishes a list of 
recommended graphic novels for teens each year. A firm 
like Secret Acres could capitalize on a literary trend that 
continues to gain ground. 
Matthews and Avelino haven’t quit their day jobs 
yet. They know it will be awhile before they can call

themselves full-time publishers. But they love the comic 
book business and they are willing to wait for the good 
times they believe are ahead. “We have faith in the fact 
that if these books find the right audience, they’ll do 
fine,” says Avelino. “I’m OK with being patient. We need 
to keep going long enough to build a back list that is 
self-supporting.” And Secret Acres already has a following 
among comic fans—their secret is out.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What steps might Matthews and Avelino take 
to create demand for their books? How must a 
small business like Secret Acres balance supply 
with demand?
2. How might Secret Acres make the most of an 
economy that is recovering slowly? What 
advantages and disadvantages might the firm 
have over a large publishing company?
3. How would you categorize the competition that 
Secret Acres faces?
4. Do you think Secret Acres should pursue online 
distribution through e-readers and other deliv-
ery systems? Why or why not?

W hat natural source of caffeine contains 
24 vitamins and minerals, 15 amino acids, and 
more antioxidants than green tea? It’s yerba mate 
(pronounced “mah-tay”), a favorite brewed drink 
that outsells coffee seven to one in its native 
Argentina and is rapidly becoming popular in the 
United States.
One big reason for the rising excitement about 
yerba mate, which produces a less jittery form of 
energy than caffeine, is a fast-growing and “green” 
company called Guayaki. Guayaki is the brainchild 
of Alex Pryor and David Karr, 30-something 
entrepreneurs who were college classmates. Pryor, a 
native of Argentina, struck a deal with his godfather 
that proved profitable for both: if his godfather 
planted mate trees to help restore the degraded 
rainforest property he owned, Pryor would buy the 
crop from him. Pryor founded Guayaki with Karr 
shortly afterwards, and the two launched their 
grassroots campaign to popularize yerba mate in 
the United States, driving cross-country in colorfully 
painted vans to offer free beverage samples at stores 
wherever they stopped. In Hollywood, they were 
lucky enough to serve their mate lattés (made with 
soy milk and honey) on a movie set. 
Now the pair employ about 30 people and sell a 
variety of mate products, such as traditional loose-
leaf “tea,” tea bags, flavored energy drinks, and 
ready-to-drink mate in bottles. Their clients include 
stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Kroger, 
Wegmans, and Vons supermarkets. Guayaki’s 
sales of 180 tons of fair-trade organic yerba mate, 
sustainably produced, earned about $12 million in 
one recent year and have helped restore 17,000 
acres of Argentine rainforest so far. Increased 
demand has led the company to partner with more 
suppliers than just Pryor’s uncle; it now works with 
many small farmers and indigenous tribes that own 
rainforest land. 
“Once the owners agree to partner,” says Pryor, 
“we provide technical advice on how to create 
nurseries, help them manage the organic growing 
process from cultivation through harvest, and then 
buy what they produce.” The owners replant the 
forest to restore its natural biodiversity and promise 
to offer their own workers good pay and working 
conditions. One tribe, the Guayaki, receives a 
licensing fee from the firm for the use of its name.
Though their yerba mate is now available in more 
than 8,000 U.S. stores and revenue is growing 
35 percent a year, Pryor and Karr have bigger plans. 
“The natural segment [of the market] isn’t saturated 
by any means,” says Karr, “and we still think we 
can double our growth in natural or even more. That 
will always be a core business for us. But we realize 
that to get scale, which is our goal, we are going 
to need more doors [to open].” That’s one reason 
the company is introducing mate in a can. “A lot of 
people who have found mate have been top athletes 
and students and people who are outdoor-oriented. 
And for that reason we wanted to have more of a 
portable, non-breakable package, which is a can.”
It appears the company will have lots of room to 
grow. “We’ve really grabbed a lot of people who 
were looking to either remove coffee from their diet 
or taper it down extensively,” Karr notes. “Coffee 
drinkers tend to like that more energetic hit and 
mate has that, as well as a richer profile because its 
flavor is more earthy and full compared to tea.”1

Consider for a moment how many 
products you used today that came from 
outside the United States. Maybe you 
drank Brazilian coffee with your breakfast, 
wore clothes manufactured in Honduras 
or Malaysia, drove to class in a German or 
Japanese car fueled by gasoline refined from 
Venezuelan crude oil, and watched a movie 
on a television set assembled in Mexico for 
a Japanese company such as Sony. A fel-
low student in Germany may be wearing 
Zara jeans, using a Samsung cell phone, and 
drinking Pepsi.
U.S. and foreign companies alike recog-
nize the importance of international trade to 
their future success. Economic interdepen-
dence is increasing throughout the world as 
companies seek additional markets for their 
goods and services and the most cost-effec-
tive locations for production facilities. No 
longer can businesses rely only on domestic 
sales. Today, foreign sales are essential to 
U.S. manufacturing, agricultural, and service 
firms as sources of new markets and profit 
opportunities. Foreign companies also fre-
quently look to the United States when they 
seek new markets.
Thousands of products cross national 
borders every day. The computers that U.S. 
manufacturers sell in Canada are exports, 
domestically produced goods and services 
sold in markets in other countries. Imports 
are foreign-made products purchased by 
domestic consumers. Together, U.S. exports 
and imports make up about a quarter of the 
U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). The 
United States is fourth in the world among 
exporting nations, with exports near 
$1 trillion, and annual imports of about 
$1.5 trillion. That total amount is more than 
double the nation’s imports and exports of 
just a decade ago.2
Transactions that cross national 
boundaries may expose a company to an 
additional set of environmental factors 
such as new social and cultural practices, 
economic and political environments, and 
legal restrictions. Before venturing into 
world markets, companies must adapt their 
domestic business strategies and plans to 
accommodate these differences.
This chapter travels through the world 
of international business to see how both 
large and small companies approach glo-
balization. First, we consider the reasons 
nations trade, the importance and charac-
teristics of the global marketplace, and the 
ways nations measure international trade. 
Then we examine barriers to international 
trade that arise from cultural and environ-
mental differences. To reduce these barriers, 
countries turn to organizations that promote 
global business. Finally, we look at the strat-
egies firms implement for entering foreign 
markets and the way they develop interna-
tional business strategies.

Why Nations Trade
As domestic markets mature and sales growth slows, companies in every industry rec-
ognize the increasing importance of efforts to develop business in other countries. Walmart 
operates stores in Mexico, Boeing sells jetliners in Asia, and soccer fans in Britain watch their 
teams being bought by U.S. billionaires. These are only a few of the thousands of U.S. compa-
nies taking advantage of large populations, substantial resources, and rising standards of living 
abroad that boost foreign interest in their goods and services. Likewise, the U.S. market, with 
the world’s highest purchasing power, attracts thousands of foreign companies to its shores.
International trade is vital to a nation and its businesses because it boosts economic 
growth by providing a market for its products and access to needed resources. Companies 
can expand their markets, seek growth opportunities in other nations, and make their pro-
duction and distribution systems more efficient. They also reduce their dependence on the 
economies of their home nations.
International Sources of Factors of Production
Business decisions to operate abroad depend on the availability, price, and quality of 
labor, natural resources, capital, and entrepreneurship—the basic factors of production—in 
the foreign country. Indian colleges and universities produce thousands of highly qualified 
computer scientists and engineers each year. To take advantage of this talent, many 
U.S. computer software and hardware firms have set up operations in India, and many 
others are outsourcing information technology and customer service jobs there.
Trading with other countries also allows a company to spread risk because different nations 
may be at different stages of the business cycle or in different phases of development. If demand 
falls off in one country, the company may still enjoy strong demand in other nations. Companies 
such as Kellogg’s and IKEA have long used international sales to offset lower domestic demand.
Size of the International Marketplace
In addition to human and natural resources, entrepreneurship, and capital, companies 
are attracted to international business by the sheer size of the global marketplace. Only one 
in six of the world’s nearly 6 billion people live in a relatively well-developed country. The 
share of the world’s population in the less developed countries will increase over the coming 
years because more developed nations have lower birthrates. But the U.S. Census Bureau 
says the global birthrate is slowing overall, and the average woman in today’s world bears 
half as many children as her counterpart did 35 years ago.3
As developing nations expand their involvement in global business, the potential for 
reaching new groups of customers dramatically increases. Firms looking for new revenue are 
inevitably attracted to giant markets such as China and India, with respective populations of 
about 1.3 billion and 1.2 billion. However, people alone are not enough to create a market. 
Consumer demand also requires purchasing power. As Table 4.1 shows, population size is 
no guarantee of economic prosperity. Of the ten most populous countries, only the United 
States appears on the list of those with the highest per-capita GDPs.
Although people in the developing nations have lower per-capita incomes than those in 
the highly developed economies of North America and western Europe, their huge

populations do represent lucrative markets. Even when the higher-income segments are only 
a small percentage of the entire country’s population, their sheer numbers may still represent 
significant and growing markets.
Also, many developing countries have typically posted high growth rates of annual GDP. 
Until the recent economic slowdown, U.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of about 4.4 per-
cent. By contrast, GDP growth in less developed countries was much greater—China’s GDP 
growth rate averaged 10.1 percent over a recent three-year period, and India’s averaged 
7.5 percent.4 These markets represent opportunities for global businesses, even though their 
per-capita incomes lag behind those in more developed countries. Many firms are establish-
ing operations in these and other developing countries to position themselves to benefit 
from local sales driven by expanding economies and rising standards of living. Walmart 
is one of those companies. The retail giant has opened dozens of new stores in develop-
ing countries from China to Brazil. It now has nearly 4,000 stores in 15 different countries 
worldwide and considers itself to be “progressing from being a domestic company with an 
international division to being a global company.”5
The United States trades with many other nations. As Figure 4.1 shows, the top five 
are Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and the Federal Republic of Germany. With the United 
Kingdom, South Korea, France, Taiwan, and Brazil, they represent nearly two-thirds of U.S. 
imports and exports every year.6 Foreign trade is such an important part of the U.S. economy 
that it makes up a large portion of the business activity in many of the country’s individual 
states as well. Texas exports more than $163 billion of goods annually, and California exports

Absolute and Comparative 
Advantage
Few countries can produce all the goods and ser-
vices their people need. For centuries, trading has been 
the way that countries can meet the demand. If a coun-
try focuses on producing what it does best, it can export 
surplus domestic output and buy foreign products that 
it lacks or cannot efficiently produce. The potential 
for foreign sales of a particular item depends largely 
on whether the country has an absolute advantage or a 
comparative advantage.
A country has an absolute advantage in making a 
product for which it can maintain a monopoly or that 
it can produce at a lower cost than any competitor. 
For centuries, China enjoyed an absolute advantage 
in silk production. The fabric was woven from fibers 
recovered from silkworm cocoons, making it a prized 
raw material in high-quality clothing. Demand among 
Europeans for silk led to establishment of the famous 
Silk Road, a 5,000-mile link between Rome and the 
ancient Chinese capital city of Xian.
Absolute advantages are rare these days. But some 
countries manage to approximate absolute advantages in some products. Climate differences 
can give some nations or regions an advantage in growing certain plants. Saffron, perhaps 
the world’s most expensive spice at around $130 per ounce, is the stigma of a flowering 
plant in the crocus family. It is native to the Mediterranean, Asia Minor, and India. 
Today, however, saffron is cultivated primarily in Spain, where the plant thrives in its 
soil and climate. Attempts to grow saffron in other parts of the world have generally been 
unsuccessful.8
A nation can develop a comparative advantage if it can supply its products more effi-
ciently and at a lower price than it can supply other goods, compared with the outputs of 
other countries. China is profiting from its comparative advantage in producing textiles. 
On the other hand, ensuring that its people are well educated is another way a nation 
can develop a comparative advantage in skilled human resources. India, for example, has 
acquired a comparative advantage in software development with its highly educated work-
force and low wage scale. As a result, several companies have moved part or all of their 
software development to India.
To boost its longstanding advantage in research and innovation as global competition 
increases, IBM recently took the unusual step of forming six global research collaborations 
with companies, universities, and governments in Saudi Arabia, China, Switzerland, Ireland, 
Taiwan, and India. The company hopes to sign at least four more such international part-
nerships, breaking with decades of tradition that dictate doing research in secret. “The world 
is our lab now,” says IBM’s director of research.9

Measuring Trade 
between Nations
Clearly, engaging in international trade provides tre-
mendous competitive advantages to both the countries and 
individual companies involved. But how do we measure global 
business activity? To understand what the trade inflows and 
outflows mean for a country, we need to examine the concepts 
of balance of trade and balance of payments. Another impor-
tant factor is currency exchange rates for each country.
A nation’s balance of trade is the difference between 
its exports and imports. If a country exports more than it 
imports, it achieves a positive balance of trade, called a trade 
surplus. If it imports more than it exports, it produces a nega-
tive balance of trade, called a trade deficit. The United States 
has run a trade deficit every year since 1976. Despite being 
one of the world’s top exporters, the United States has an even greater appetite for foreign-
made goods, which creates a trade deficit.
A nation’s balance of trade plays a central role in determining its balance of payments—
the overall flow of money into or out of a country. Other factors also affect the balance of 
payments, including overseas loans and borrowing, international investments, profits from 
such investments, and foreign aid payments. To calculate a nation’s balance of payments, 
subtract the monetary outflows from the monetary inflows. A positive balance of payments, 
or a balance-of-payments surplus, means more money has moved into a country than out of it. 
A negative balance of payments, or balance-of-payments deficit, means more money has gone 
out of the country than entered it.
Major U.S. Exports and Imports
The United States, with combined exports and imports of about $2.5 trillion, leads the 
world in the international trade of goods and services. As listed in Table 4.2, the leading cat-
egories of goods exchanged by U.S. exporters and importers range from machinery and vehi-
cles to crude oil and chemicals. Strong U.S. demand for imported goods is partly a reflection 
of the nation’s prosperity and diversity.
Although the United States imports more goods than it exports, the opposite is true for 
services. U.S. exporters sell more than $507 billion in services annually. Much of that money 
comes from travel and tourism—money spent by foreign nationals visiting the United 
States.10 The increase in that figure is especially significant because the dollar has declined 
and continues to fluctuate in terms of foreign currencies in recent years. U.S. service exports 
also include business and technical services such as engineering, financial services, comput-
ing, legal services, and entertainment, as well as royalties and licensing fees. Major service 
exporters include Citibank, Walt Disney, Allstate Insurance, and Federal Express, as well as 
retailers such as McDonald’s and Starbucks.
Businesses in many foreign countries want the expertise of U.S. financial and busi-
ness professionals. Accountants are in high demand in Russia, China, the Netherlands, and 
Australia—Sydney has become one of Asia’s biggest financial centers. Entertainment is

another major growth area for U.S. service exports. The Walt Disney Company has long 
had theme parks in Europe and Asia and will begin a new one in Shanghai with the approval 
of China’s central government.11
With annual imports reaching nearly $2 trillion, the United States is by far the world’s 
leading importer. American tastes for foreign-made goods for everything from clothing to 
consumer electronics show up as huge trade deficits with the consumer-goods-exporting 
nations of China and Japan.
Exchange Rates
A nation’s exchange rate is the rate at which its currency can be exchanged for the cur-
rencies of other nations. It is important to learn how foreign exchange works because we live 
in a global community and the value of currency is an important economic thermometer for 
every country. Each currency’s exchange rate is usually quoted in terms of another currency, 
such as the number of Mexican pesos needed to purchase one U.S. dollar. Roughly 12 pesos 
are needed to exchange for a dollar. A Canadian dollar can be exchanged for approximately $1 
in the United States. The euro, the currency used in most of the European Union (EU) mem-
ber countries, has made considerable moves in exchange value during its few years in circula-
tion. European consumers and businesses now use the euro to pay bills by check, credit card, 
or bank transfer. Euro coins and notes are also used in many EU member-countries.
Foreign exchange rates are influenced by a number of factors, including domestic eco-
nomic and political conditions, central bank intervention, balance-of-payments position, and 
speculation over future currency values. Currency values fluctuate, or “float,” depending on 
the supply and demand for each currency in the international market. In this system of

floating exchange rates, currency traders create a market for the world’s 
currencies based on each country’s relative trade and investment pros-
pects. In theory, this market permits exchange rates to vary freely 
according to supply and demand. In practice, exchange rates do not float 
in total freedom. National governments often intervene in currency 
markets to adjust their exchange rates.
Nations influence exchange rates in other ways as well. They may 
form currency blocs by linking their exchange rates to each other. Many 
governments practice protectionist policies that seek to guard their 
economies against trade imbalances. For instance, nations sometimes 
take deliberate action to devalue their currencies as a way to increase 
exports and stimulate foreign investment. Devaluation describes a 
drop in a currency’s value relative to other currencies or to a fixed stan-
dard. In Brazil, a currency devaluation made investing in that country 
relatively cheap, so the devaluation was followed by a flood of foreign 
investment. Pillsbury bought Brazil’s Brisco, which makes a local staple, 
pao de queijo, a cheese bread formed into rolls and served with morning 
coffee. Other foreign companies invested in Brazil’s construction, tour-
ism, banking, communications, and other industries.
For an individual business, the impact of currency devaluation 
depends on where that business buys its materials and where it sells 
its products. Business transactions are usually conducted in the cur-
rency of the particular region in which they take place. When business 
is conducted in Japan, transactions are likely to be in yen. In the United 
Kingdom, transactions are in pounds. With the adoption of the euro 
in the EU, the number of currencies in that region has been reduced. 
At present, the EU member-countries using the euro include Austria, 
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, 
the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain. Other countries’ currencies include the British 
pound, Australian dollar, the Indian rupee, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, the Taiwanese 
dollar, and the South African rand.
Exchange rate changes can quickly create—or wipe out—a competitive advantage, so 
they are important factors in decisions about whether to invest abroad. In Europe, a declin-
ing dollar means that a price of ten euros is worth more, so companies are pressured to 
lower prices. At the same time, if the dollar falls it makes European vacations less affordable 
for U.S. tourists because their dollars are worth less relative to the euro.
On the Internet you can find currency converters such as those located at http:// begin-
nersinvest.about.com/od/currencycalc/Currency_Calculator.htm, which can help in your 
monetary conversions. It also helps you understand how much spending power a U.S. dollar 
has in other countries.
Currencies that owners can easily convert into other currencies are called hard currencies. 
Examples include the euro, the U.S. dollar, and the Japanese yen. The Russian ruble and many 
central European currencies are considered soft currencies because they cannot be readily con-
verted. Exporters trading with these countries sometimes prefer to barter, accepting payment 
in oil, timber, or other commodities that they can resell for hard-currency payments.
The foreign currency market is the largest financial market in the world, with a daily 
volume in excess of 3 trillion U.S. dollars.12 This is about ten times the size of all the world’s 
stock markets combined, so the foreign exchange market is the most liquid and efficient 
financial market in the world.

Barriers to International Trade
All businesses encounter barriers in their operations, whether they sell only to local cus-
tomers or trade in international markets. Countries such as Australia and New Zealand regu-
late the hours and days retailers may be open. Besides complying with a variety of laws and 
exchanging currencies, international companies may also have to reformulate their products 
to accommodate different tastes in new locations. After many years of disappointing results 
in China, Kraft recently won nearly a quarter of China’s $1.6 billion cookie market by mak-
ing its Oreo cookies less sweet to suit local tastes and launching new products including 
Oreo Wafer Sticks, Wafer Rolls, Soft Cakes, and Strawberry Cremes.13
In addition to social and cultural differences, companies engaged in international business 
face economic barriers as well as legal and political ones. Some of the hurdles shown in 
Figure 4.2 are easily breached, but others require major changes in a company’s business strat-
egy. To successfully compete in global markets, companies and their managers must under-
stand not only how these barriers affect international trade but also how to overcome them.
Social and Cultural Differences
The social and cultural differences among nations range from language and customs 
to educational background and religious holidays. Understanding and respecting these dif-
ferences are critical to pave the way for international business success. Businesspeople with 
knowledge of host countries’ cultures, languages, social values, and religious attitudes and 
practices are well equipped for the marketplace and the negotiating table. Sensitivity to 
such elements as local attitudes, forms of address, and expectations regarding dress, body 
language, and timeliness also helps them win customers and achieve their business objec-
tives. It is not only U.S. executives who are adapting to the global business environment. 
Considering the number of transactions that are sealed on the golf links, Chinese students 
at Xiamen University must learn golf, as well as business and law, and Peking University is 
building a practice green. The “Business Etiquette” feature offers suggestions for under-
standing the Japanese culture.
Language English is the second most widely spoken language in the world, followed 
by Hindustani, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic. Only Mandarin Chinese is more commonly 
used. It is not uncommon for students abroad for whom English is not their first language to 
spend eight years of elementary and high school in English language classes. Understanding 
a business colleague’s primary language may prove to be the difference between closing an

international business transaction and losing the 
sale to someone else. Company representatives 
operating in foreign markets must not only choose 
correct and appropriate words but also translate 
words correctly to convey the intended mean-
ings. Firms may also need to rename products or 
rewrite slogans for foreign markets.
Potential communication barriers include 
more than mistranslation. Companies may present 
messages through inappropriate media, overlook 
local customs and regulations, or ignore differ-
ences in taste. One U.S. executive recently lost a 
deal in China by giving the prospective client a 
set of four antique clocks wrapped in white paper. 
Unfortunately, the number four and the Chinese 
word for clock are similar to the word “death,” 
while white is the traditional color for funer-
als.14 Cultural sensitivity is especially critical in 
cyberspace. Web site developers must be aware 
that visitors to a site may come from anywhere in 
the world. Some icons that seem friendly to U.S. 
Internet users may shock people from other coun-
tries. A person making a high-five hand gesture 
would be insulting people in Greece; the same is 
true of making a circle with the thumb and index 
finger in Brazil, a thumbs-up sign in Egypt, and a 
two-fingered peace sign with the back of the hand 
facing out in Great Britain.
Gift-giving traditions employ the language of 
symbolism. For example, in Latin America, knives 
and scissors should not be given as gifts because 
they represent the severing of friendship. Flowers 
are generally acceptable, but Mexicans use yellow 
flowers in their Day of the Dead festivities, so they 
are associated with death.
Values and Religious Attitudes 
Even though today’s world is shrinking in many 
ways, people in different countries do not neces-
sarily share the same values or religious attitudes. 
Marked differences remain in workers’ attitudes 
from country to country, for instance.
U.S. society places a higher value on business 
efficiency and low unemployment than European 
society, where employee benefits are more valued. 
The U.S. government does not regulate vacation

Tips for Understanding Japanese Culture
Japan’s 125 million people live in a fairly small area and tend to be reserved 
and introverted; their culture emphasizes conformity more than in the United 
States. Their literacy rate is nearly 100 percent; 95 percent of the popula-
tion has completed high school. Buddhism and Shintoism are the dominant 
religions. Here are some tips for respecting Japanese culture that can help you 
in your global business dealings.
 • Dress to impress. Casual wear is not appropriate in work situations. 
 • Because you will often remove your shoes indoors in Japan, choose slip-
on styles that are easy to get on and off.
 • Avoid large hand gestures and pointing; the Japanese do not talk with 
their hands and may ﬁ nd it distracting.
 • Respect others’ personal space. While handshakes are becoming more 
common, bowing is still the traditional greeting. 
 • Remember that in Japan a smile can legitimately mean many things, 
including anger, sorrow, or embarrassment.
 • Keep in mind that the Japanese don’t make frequent eye contact and 
are very comfortable with silence. Don’t feel you need to ﬁ ll conversa-
tional gaps.
 • Business entertaining most often occurs in bars and restaurants after the 
end of the workday. Tipping is not required.
 • If you are invited to a Japanese home, consider yourself honored.
 • Remember to give and receive business cards with both hands. Show 
respect for a business card you are given by examining it carefully.
 • Always wrap gifts. In Japan it’s safest to have the store wrap your gifts to 
ensure the paper and other details are appropriate. White, for instance, 
symbolizes death.
 • Keep in mind that the Japanese dislike criticism. They also prefer not say-
ing no and may say yes when they mean otherwise.

four weeks if they stay with the same employer for many years. In contrast, the EU mandates 
a minimum paid vacation of four weeks per year, and most Europeans get five or six weeks. 
In these countries, a U.S. company that opens a manufacturing plant would not be able to 
hire any local employees without offering vacations in line with a nation’s business practices.
U.S. culture values national unity, with tolerance of regional differences. The United 
States is viewed as a national market with a single economy. European countries that are part 
of the 27-member EU are trying to create a similar marketplace. However, many resist the 
idea of being European citizens first and British, Danish, or Dutch citizens second. British 
consumers differ from Italians in important ways, and U.S. companies that fail to recognize 
this variation will run into problems with brand acceptance.
Religion plays an important role in every society, so businesspeople must also cultivate 
sensitivity to the dominant religions in countries where they operate. Understanding religious 
cycles and the timing of major holidays can help prevent embarrassing moments when sched-
uling meetings, trade shows, conferences, or events such as the opening of a new manufactur-
ing plant. People doing business in Saudi Arabia must take into account Islam’s month-long 
observance of Ramadan, when work ends at noon. Friday is the Muslim Sabbath, so the Saudi 
workweek runs from Saturday through Thursday. Also, Muslims abstain from alcohol and 
consider pork unclean, so gifts of pigskin or liquor would be offensive. 
Economic Differences
Business opportunities are flourishing in densely populated countries such as China and 
India, as local consumers eagerly buy Western products. Although such prospects might tempt 
American firms, managers must first consider the economic factors involved in doing business 
in these markets. A country’s size, per-capita income, and stage of economic development are 
among the economic factors to consider when evaluating it as a candidate for an international 
business venture. Tata, for instance, has an eye on Western auto buyers, even as it shapes its 
low-budget Nano car for the home market in India. See the “Hit & Miss” feature for details.
Infrastructure Along with other economic measures, businesses should consider 
a country’s infrastructure. Infrastructure refers to basic systems of communication (tele-
communications, television, radio, and print media), transportation (roads and highways, 
railroads, and airports), and energy facilities (power plants and gas and electric utilities). The 
Internet and technology use can also be considered part of infrastructure.
India’s growing industrialization and its latest projections of 30 million air passengers a 
year mean the country will soon need at least 400 new airports, according to the country’s 
civil aviation minister. With the Indian aviation industry growing at nearly 20 percent a year, 
3,000 new planes will also be needed. Bidding for contractors to work on construction of a 
new airport in the capital city of Mumbai will take about a year to complete. “Our job is not 
over by creating infrastructure for aviation industry to grow,” said the minister. “We need 
safe and secure aviation. Indian aviation will not grow at the cost of safety and security.” Part 
of India’s new air travel security is a CT scanner to inspect luggage at the country’s biggest 
new airport, built in a record three years in New Delhi.15
Financial systems also provide a type of infrastructure for businesses. In the United 
States, buyers have widespread access to checks, credit cards, and debit cards, as well as 
electronic systems for processing these forms of payment. In many African countries, such 
as Ethiopia, local businesses do not accept credit cards, so travelers to the capital city, Addis 
Ababa, are warned to bring plenty of cash and traveler’s checks.

Currency Conversion and Shifts Despite growing similarities in infra-
structure, businesses crossing national borders encounter basic economic differences: 
national currencies. Foreign currency fluctuations may present added problems for global 
businesses. As explained earlier in the chapter, the values of the world’s major currencies 
fluctuate—sometimes drastically—in relation to each other. Rapid and unexpected currency 
shifts can make pricing in local currencies difficult. Shifts in exchange rates can also influ-
ence the attractiveness of various business decisions. A devalued currency may make a nation 
less desirable as an export destination because of reduced demand in that market. However, 
devaluation can make the nation desirable as an investment opportunity because investments 
there will be a bargain in terms of the investor’s currency.
Political and Legal Differences
Like social, cultural, and economic differences, legal and political differences in host 
countries can pose barriers to international trade. Government oversight of Internet use in 
China is so strict that many Chinese Web sites are now registering overseas to try to avoid 
censorship.16 Such actions pose threats to those considering doing business there.
To compete in today’s world marketplace, managers involved in international business 
must be well versed in legislation that affects their industries. Some countries impose general 
trade restrictions. Others have established detailed rules that regulate how foreign companies 
can operate. 
Political Climate An important factor in any international business investment is 
the stability of the political climate. The political structures of many nations promote stability 
CLASS ACTIVITY: 
Discuss the recent 
difficulties Google has 
faced doing business in 
China. 
When the Tata Nano, a tiny new car for sale in India for $2,500, 
arrived in the United States recently, it wasn’t on the road; it was on 
display at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York. 
“As the world’s most affordable car, it is a design achievement,” said a 
museum director.
The Nano is also a safe and sturdy vehicle. More, it is a potential 
revolution in transportation for millions of Indian families that can’t 
otherwise afford a car. In building its “people’s car,” Tata has relied on 
existing parts and a highly simplified design to limit costs.
“My particular fascination about the Nano is what I refer to as 
the ‘Nano effect’ on the rest of the world’s vehicle industry,” said one 
research director. He predicts people everywhere will ask, “If Indians 
can buy a four-door car for $2,500, why can’t I?”
Perhaps they soon can. Tata, a $63 billion Indian conglomerate, 
backed the Nano through legal troubles over the land needed for a 
manufacturing plant that delayed production for two years. The recent 
recession also brought Tata its first financial losses in seven years, just 
when it faced heavy debts incurred when it bought the money-losing 
Jaguar and Land Rover brands from Ford Motor.
But Tata’s strategic plan is still to achieve international stature 
by solving the transportation problems of low-income car markets in 
the developing world. It will sell the Nano in Nigeria next and has 
already hurdled Europe’s crash-safety test. In just a few years, slightly 
higher-priced Nanos may roam the streets of Europe and even North 
America.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Do you think Tata’s goal of making transportation 
affordable in developing countries is realistic? Why or 
why not?
2. Can you think of any disadvantages for low-income 
markets of having a sudden influx of cars on the road?

similar to that in the United States. Other nations, such as Indonesia, Congo, and Bosnia, 
feature quite different—and frequently changing—structures. Host nations often pass laws 
designed to protect their own interests, sometimes at the expense of foreign businesses. See 
the “Ethical Controversy” feature for a look at how fair trade laws work.
The political structures of Russia, Turkey, the former Yugoslavia, Hong Kong, and 
several central European countries, including the Czech Republic and Poland, have seen dra-
matic changes. Such political changes almost always bring changes in the legal environment. 
Hong Kong’s status as part of China makes it an economy where political developments 
produced changes in the legal and cultural environments. Since the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, Russia has struggled to develop a new market structure and political processes.
Legal Environment When conducting business internationally, managers must 
be familiar with three dimensions of the legal environment: U.S. law, international regula-
tions, and the laws of the countries in which they plan to trade. Some laws protect the rights 
of foreign companies to compete in the United States. Others dictate actions allowed for 
U.S. companies doing business in foreign countries.
 
While demand for candy remains high, the price of cocoa is near a 
30-year-high. One reason is that to win the coveted “fair trade” desig-
nation for their products, chocolate makers must pay small cocoa farm-
ers an extra $150 per ton for the raw ingredient and accept a price of 
at least $1,600 a ton overall. Nestlé recently announced its popular Kit 
Kat chocolate bars, which represent about a quarter of the company’s 
U.K. candy sales, will now include only fair trade chocolate from West 
Africa. Still, the company has come under criticism for allegedly lagging 
on other possible problems such as child labor. 
Is “fair trade” fair enough?
Summary
The share of fair trade chocolate sold in the U.K. was expected to soon rise to about 10 percent, a 
ten-fold increase, in part because of Nestlé’s efforts. Nestlé has promised to plant millions of disease-
resistant cocoa trees in Africa over the next few years and to spend at least $445 million on sustainable 
farming projects in the same period. It has also agreed to a global initiative to improve cocoa farmers’ 
access to health care and to combat child labor.

PRO
1. As one of the world’s largest buyers of cocoa beans for Kit Kat, 
Nestlé is taking a strong lead in social responsibility, even though high 
fair-trade cocoa prices are “going to put pressure on our business,” 
according to the firm’s U.K. head.
2. Nestlé’s efforts will provide poor cocoa farmers with cash, trees, 
and training, and help them keep children in school.
CON
1. If a company allows the use of child labor on its behalf abroad, 
its fair trade claims are mere window-dressing.
2. Firms can and should ensure that all their actions are socially 
responsible at every level, at home and abroad.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act forbids U.S. companies from bribing foreign officials, 
political candidates, or government representatives. This act prescribes fines and jail time 
for U.S. managers who are aware of illegal payoffs. Until recently, many countries, including 
France and Germany, not only accepted the practice of bribing foreign officials in coun-
tries where such practices were customary but allowed tax deductions for these expenses. 
The United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and 36 other countries have signed 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention. 
Though active enforcement has been slight, this agreement makes offering or paying bribes 
a criminal offense and ends the deductibility of bribes.17
Still, corruption continues to be an international problem. Its pervasiveness, combined 
with U.S. prohibitions, creates a difficult obstacle for U.S. businesspeople whom want to 
do business in many foreign countries. Chinese pay huilu, and Russians rely on vzyatka. In 
the Middle East, palms are greased with baksheesh. Figure 4.3 compares 179 countries based 
on surveys of perceived corruption. This Corruption Perceptions Index is computed by 
Transparency International, a Berlin-based organization that rates the degree of corruption 
observed by businesspeople and the general public.
The growth of online business has introduced new elements to the legal climate of inter-
national business. Patents, brand names, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual prop-
erty are difficult to police, given the availability of information on the Internet. However, 
some countries are adopting laws to protect information obtained by electronic contacts.

Malaysia imposes stiff fines and long jail terms on those convicted of illegally accessing com-

International Regulations To regulate international commerce, the United 
States and many other countries have ratified treaties and signed agreements that dictate the 
conduct of international business and protect some of its activities. The United States has 
entered into many friendship, commerce, and navigation treaties with other nations. Such trea-
ties address many aspects of international business relations, including the right to conduct 
business in the treaty partner’s domestic market. Other international business agreements 
involve product standards, patents, trademarks, reciprocal tax policies, export controls, inter-
national air travel, and international communications. One area in which there are no inter-
national regulations involves the use/protection of water supplies. IBM is stepping in to help 
provide the international community with water-management methods and tools as we see 
in the “Going Green” feature.
When Congress granted China full trade relations with the United States, China 
agreed to lower trade barriers, including subsidies that held down the prices of food 
exports, restrictions on where foreign law firms can open offices, and taxes charged on 
imported goods. In exchange for China’s promise to halve these taxes, called tariffs, the 
United States granted Chinese businesses equal access to U.S. markets enjoyed by most 
other countries.
Many types of regulations affect the actions of managers doing business in international 
markets. Not only must worldwide producers and marketers maintain required minimum 
quality levels for all the countries in which they operate, but they must comply with 
IBM Helps Keep Water Flowing
Did you know it takes 11 gallons of water to manufacture one 
slice of bread, and 35 gallons to make a single cup of coffee?  Water, 
one of our most abundant resources, is under ever-greater stress.  One 
in five people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water.
IBM is taking major steps to protect the Earth’s finite supply of 
water.  Though this essential resource exists worldwide, there is no 
global market for it and little international or even national exchange 
of information about how to conserve it.  “Water is about quantity, 
quality, space, and time,” says IBM’s Global Innovation Outlook report 
on the world’s water management problems.  “Whether you have a big 
problem or not depends entirely on where you live.”
IBM is addressing the future of water management in several 
ways.  It is setting up networks of meters and sensors with special 
IBM software to monitor the capacity and quality of water systems 
that serve nations, communities, organizations, and individual homes. 
The company is working to ensure that treated drinking water is 
subject to less waste from thousands of miles of aging underground 
pipes and  IBM’s acoustic technology helps locate the worst leaks for 
priority repairs. IBM is also collecting data on pollution, marine life, 
and waves for commercial fishermen, and improving filters to inex-
pensively eliminate arsenic and salt from drinking water in developing 
countries.
“We’re not going to create water where there is none,” says the 
vice president of IBM’s Big Green Innovations.  “But where we know 
water is under stress, we need to monitor what’s going on and better 
manage it.”
 Questions for Critical Thinking
1. For its water-management efforts, Fast Company magazine 
recently voted IBM 18th in the world in innovation.  What 
do you think makes IBM particularly suited for this award?
2. IBM is an information services company.   What do you 
think other socially responsible firms could learn from its 
water-management efforts?

numerous specific local regulations. Britain prevents advertisers from encouraging chil-
dren to engage in such unhealthy behavior as overeating or replacing regular meals with 
candy and snack foods. Malaysia’s Censorship Board prohibits nudity and profanity on TV. 
Germany and France allow publishers to set prices that retailers charge for their books.
The British government, as part of an initiative to fight violence against women, 
recently commissioned a report showing that children and teens are being increasingly 
exposed to unhealthy pressures by images of “hyper-sexualised images” of an adult nature 
in the media. “They are facing pressures that children in the past simply did not have to 
face,” the report said, including the idea that it is necessary to look “hot” and “sexy.” The 
report proposed that parental controls in new videogame consoles and mobile phones be 
switched on before sale, that men’s magazines carry age warnings, and that sexually oriented 
music videos be broadcast only late in the evening.18
Types of Trade Restrictions
Trade restrictions such as taxes on imports and complicated administrative procedures 
create additional barriers to international business. They may limit consumer choices while 
increasing the costs of foreign-made products. Trade restrictions are also imposed to protect 
citizens’ security, health, and jobs. A government may limit exports of strategic and defense-
related goods to unfriendly countries to protect its security, ban imports of insecticide-
contaminated farm products to protect health, and restrict imports to protect domestic jobs 
in the importing country.
Other restrictions are imposed to promote trade with certain countries. Still others pro-
tect countries from unfair competition. Regardless of the political reasons for trade restric-
tions, most take the form of tariffs. In addition to tariffs, governments impose a number 
of nontariff—or administrative—barriers. These include quotas, embargoes, and exchange 
controls.
Tariffs Taxes, surcharges, or duties on foreign products are referred to as tariffs. 
Governments assess two types of tariffs—revenue and protective tariffs—both of which make 
imports more expensive for domestic buyers. Revenue tariffs generate income for the gov-
ernment. Upon returning home, U.S. leisure travelers who are out of the country more than 
48 hours and who bring back goods purchased abroad must pay import taxes on their value 
in excess of $200 to $1,600, depending on the country of origin. This duty goes directly 
to the U.S. Treasury. The sole purpose of a protective tariff is to raise the retail price of 
imported products to match or exceed the prices of similar products manufactured in the 
home country. In other words, protective tariffs seek to limit imports and level the playing 
field for local competitors.
Of course, tariffs create a disadvantage to companies that want to export to the countries 
imposing the tariffs. In addition, governments do not always agree on the reasons behind 
protective tariffs. So they do not always have the desired effect. The United States imposes a 
tariff on foreign competitors accused of selling products at lower prices in the United States 
than U.S. manufacturers charge. The government passed a bill giving the money from these 
tariffs directly to U.S. plaintiff companies, instead of to the Treasury as in the past. The 
European Union imposes tariffs on some electronics products, which the United States says 
violates the 1997 Information Technology Agreement (ITA) calling for the elimination of 
tariffs on such items as computers and computer parts.19
tariffs tax imposed on 
imported goods.

Chapter 4  Competing in World Markets
121
Nontariff Barriers Nontariff, or administra-
tive, trade barriers restrict imports in more subtle ways 
than tariffs. These measures may take such forms as 
quotas on imports, restrictive standards for imports, and 
export subsidies. Because many countries have recently 
substantially reduced tariffs or eliminated them entirely, 
they increasingly use nontariff barriers to control flows 
of imported products.
Quotas limit the amounts of particular products 
that countries can import during specified time periods. 
Limits may be set as quantities, such as number of cars 
or bushels of wheat, or as values, such as dollars’ worth 
of cigarettes. Governments regularly set quotas for 
agricultural products and sometimes for imported auto-
mobiles. The United States, for example, sets a quota 
on imports of sugar. Imports under the quota amount 
are subject to a lower tariff than shipments above the 
quota. Sugar and related products imported at the 
higher rate may enter the country in unlimited quanti-
ties, however.20
Quotas help prevent dumping. In one form of dumping, a company sells products abroad 
at prices below its cost of production. In another, a company exports a large quantity of a 
product at a lower price than the same product in the home market and drives down the price 
of the domestic product. Dumping benefits domestic consumers in the importing market, but 
it hurts domestic producers. It also allows companies to gain quick entry to foreign markets.
More severe than a quota, an embargo imposes a total ban on importing a specified 
product or even a total halt to trading with a particular country. The United States has 
a longstanding trade embargo with Cuba. Embargo durations can vary to accommodate 
changes in foreign policy. 
Another form of administrative trade restriction is exchange control. Imposed through 
a central bank or government agency, exchange controls affect both exporters and importers. 
Firms that gain foreign currencies through exporting are required to sell them to the central 
bank or another agency. Importers must buy foreign currencies to pay for their purchases 
from the same agency. The exchange control authority can then allocate, expand, or restrict 
foreign exchange in accordance with national policy.
Reducing Barriers to 
International Trade
Although tariffs and administrative barriers still restrict trade, overall the world is moving 
toward free trade. Several types of organizations ease barriers to international trade, including 
groups that monitor trade policies and practices and institutions that offer monetary assistance. 
Another type of federation designed to ease trade barriers is the multinational economic com-
munity, such as the European Union. This section looks at the roles these organizations play.

Organizations Promoting International Trade
For the 60-plus years of its existence, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), an international trade accord, sponsored a series of negotiations, called rounds, 
which substantially reduced worldwide tariffs and other barriers. Major industrialized nations 
founded the multinational organization in 1947 to work toward reducing tariffs and relax-
ing import quotas. The last set of completed negotiations—the Uruguay Round—cut aver-
age tariffs by one-third, in excess of $700 billion; reduced farm subsidies; and improved 
protection for copyright and patent holders. In addition, international trading rules now 
apply to various service industries. Finally, the new agreement established the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) to succeed GATT. This organization includes representatives from 
153 countries.
World Trade Organization Since 1995, the WTO has monitored GATT 
agreements among the member-nations, mediated disputes, and continued the effort to 
reduce trade barriers throughout the world. Unlike provisions in GATT, the WTO’s deci-
sions are binding on parties involved in disputes.
The WTO has grown more controversial in recent years as it issues decisions that have 
implications for working conditions and the environment in member nations. Concerns have 
been expressed that the WTO’s focus on lowering trade barriers encourages businesses to 
keep costs down through practices that may increase pollution and human rights abuses. 
Particularly worrisome is the fact that the organization’s member-countries must agree on 
policies, and developing countries tend not to be eager to lose their low-cost advantage by 
enacting stricter labor and environmental laws. Other critics claim that if well-funded U.S. 
firms such as fast-food chains, entertainment companies, and Internet retailers can freely 
enter foreign markets, they will wipe out smaller foreign businesses serving the distinct tastes 
and practices of other countries’ cultures.
Trade unions in developed nations complain that the WTO’s support of free trade 
makes it easier to export manufacturing jobs to low-wage countries. U.S. glassmaking is 
undergoing a long decline that began in the 1990s, aided by increased imports and bigger 
profits to be made overseas.21
But many small and midsize firms have benefited from the WTO’s reduction of trade 
barriers and lowering of the cost of trade. They currently make up 97 percent of all firms 
that export goods and services, according to the Department of Commerce.
The most recent round of WTO talks was called the Doha Round after the city in Qatar 
where it began. After several years of heated disputes and collapsed negotiations, the eight 
leading industrial nations recommitted themselves to successful conclusion of the talks. 
Under discussion were ways to improve global agricultural trade and trade among develop-
ing countries. The leaders worked to reduce domestic price supports, eliminate export sub-
sidies, and improve market access for goods. Such changes could help farmers in developing 
countries compete in the global marketplace.22
 World Bank Shortly after the end of World War II, industrialized nations formed 
an organization to lend money to less developed and developing countries. The World Bank 
primarily funds projects that build or expand nations’ infrastructure such as transportation, 
education, and medical systems and facilities. The World Bank and other development banks 
provide the largest source of advice and assistance to developing nations. Often, in exchange 
for granting loans, the World Bank imposes requirements intended to build the economies 
of borrower nations.

The World Bank has been criticized for making loans with conditions that ultimately 
hurt the borrower nations. When developing nations are required to balance govern-
ment budgets, they are sometimes forced to cut vital social programs. Critics also say that 
the World Bank should consider the impact of its loans on the environment and working 
conditions.
International Monetary Fund Established a year after the World Bank, 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was created to promote trade through financial 
cooperation and, in the process, eliminate barriers. The IMF makes short-term loans to 
member nations that are unable to meet their expenses. It operates as a lender of last resort 
for troubled nations. In exchange for these emergency loans, IMF lenders frequently require 
significant commitments from the borrowing nations to address the problems that led to the 
crises. These steps may include curtailing imports or even devaluing currencies. Throughout 
its existence, the IMF has worked to prevent financial crises by warning the international 
business community when countries encounter problems meeting their financial obligations. 
Often, the IMF lends to countries to keep them from defaulting on prior debts and to pre-
vent economic crises in particular countries from spreading to other nations.
However, some countries owe far more money than they can ever hope to repay, and 
the debt payments make it impossible for their governments to deliver desperately needed 
services to their citizens. Following a devastating earthquake in Haiti, the G7 countries (the 
world’s most industrialized nations including the United States, Canada, France, and Brazil) 
promised to cancel any remaining debt owed them by Haiti. The World Bank not only 
pledged financial support as Haiti struggled to get back on its feet but also waived payment 
on Haiti’s debt for five years while it sought a way to cancel the remaining debt.23
International Economic Communities
International economic communities reduce trade barriers and promote regional eco-
nomic integration. In the simplest approach, countries may establish a free-trade area in 
which they trade freely among themselves without tariffs or trade restrictions. Each main-
tains its own tariffs for trade outside this area. A customs union sets up a free-trade area and 
specifies a uniform tariff structure for members’ trade with nonmember nations. In a common 
market, or economic union, members go beyond a customs union and try to bring all of their 
trade rules into agreement.
One example of a free-trade area is the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) enacted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Other examples of regional 
trading blocs include the MERCOSUR customs union (joining Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, 
Uruguay, Chile, and Bolivia) and the ten-country Association of South East Asian Nations 
(ASEAN).
NAFTA
NAFTA became effective in 1994, creating the world’s largest free-trade zone with the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico. With a combined population of more than 450 million 
and a total GDP of more than $15 trillion, North America represents one of the world’s most 
attractive markets. The United States—the single largest market—dominates North America’s 
business environment. Although fewer than 1 person in 20 lives in the United States, the 
nation’s more than $14 trillion GDP represents about one-fifth of total world output.24

Canada is far less densely populated 
but has achieved a similar level of economic 
development. In fact, Canada’s economy has 
been growing at a faster rate than the U.S. 
economy in recent years. More than two-thirds 
of Canada’s GDP is generated in the services 
sector, and three of every four Canadian 
workers are engaged in service occupations. 
The country’s per-capita GDP places Canada 
among the top nations in terms of its people’s 
spending power. Canada’s economy is fueled 
by trade with the United States, and its home 
markets are strong as well. The United States 
and Canada are each other’s biggest trading 
partners. About 78 percent of Canada’s exports 
and about 53 percent of its imports are to or 
from the United States.25 U.S. business is also 
attracted by Canada’s human resources. For 
instance, all major U.S. automakers have large 
production facilities in Canada.
Mexico is moving from developing nation to industrial nation status, thanks largely to 
NAFTA. Mexico’s trade with the United States and Canada has tripled since the signing 
of NAFTA, although 18 percent of the country’s 111 million people live below the poverty 
line and per-capita income is about a quarter that of the United States. But Mexico’s bor-
der with the United States is busy with a nearly endless stream of traffic transporting goods 
from Mexican factories into the United States. The United States is Mexico’s largest trading 
partner by far, accounting for about 80 percent of total exports and almost 50 percent of all 
Mexico’s imports.26
By eliminating all trade barriers and investment restrictions among the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico over a 15-year period, NAFTA opened more doors for free trade. The 
agreement also eased regulations governing services, such as banking, and established uni-
form legal requirements for protection of intellectual property. The three nations can now 
trade with one another without tariffs or other trade barriers, simplifying shipments of goods 
across the partners’ borders. Standardized customs and uniform labeling regulations create 
economic efficiencies and smooth import and export procedures. Trade among the partners 
has increased steadily, more than doubling since NAFTA took effect.
CAFTA-DR
The Central America–Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) 
created a free-trade area among the United States, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic (the 
DR of the title), El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The agreement ends 
most tariffs on nearly $33 billion in products traded between the United States and its Latin 
American neighbors. Agricultural producers such as corn, soybean, and dairy farmers stand 
to gain under the relaxed trade rules. U.S. sugar producers, which were supported by sub-
sidies keeping their prices higher than the rest of the world, fought against CAFTA-DR’s 
passage. And labor unions complained that the agreement would lower labor standards and 
export millions more jobs to lower-wage countries. But overall, CAFTA-DR’s effects should 
be positive, increasing both exports and imports substantially, much as NAFTA did.

European Union
Perhaps the best-known example of a 
common market is the European Union 
(EU). The EU combines 27 countries, 
nearly 500 million people, and a total 
GDP of roughly $12.28 trillion to form 
a huge common market.27 As Figure 4.4 
shows, 12 countries—Cyprus, Malta, 
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, 
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Romania—are 
the latest EU members. The Treaty of 
Lisbon took effect in 2009, with its goal 
to be making the union governance more 
efficient.
The EU’s goals include promoting economic and social progress, introducing European 
citizenship as a complement to national citizenship, and giving the EU a significant role in 
international affairs. To achieve its goal of a borderless Europe, the EU is removing barriers 
to free trade among its members. This highly complex process involves standardizing busi-
ness regulations and requirements, standardizing import duties and taxes, and eliminating 
customs checks so that companies can transport goods from England to Italy or Poland as 
easily as from New York to Boston.
Unifying standards and laws can contribute to economic growth. But just as NAFTA 
sparked fears in the United States about free trade with Mexico, some people in western 
Europe worried that opening trade with such countries as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech 
Republic would cause jobs to flow eastward to lower-wage economies.
The EU also introduced the euro to replace currencies such as the French franc and 
Italian lira. For the 13 member-states that have adopted the euro, potential benefits include 
eliminating the economic costs of currency exchange and simplifying price comparisons. 
Businesses and their customers now make check and credit card transactions in euros and use 
euro notes and coins in making cash purchases.
Going Global
While expanding into overseas markets can increase profits and marketing opportunities, 
it also introduces new complexities to a firm’s business operations. Before deciding to go 
global, a company faces a number of key decisions, beginning with the following:
 
• determining which foreign market(s) to enter
 • analyzing the expenditures required to enter a new market
 • deciding the best way to organize the overseas operations.
These issues vary in importance depending on the level of involvement a company 
chooses. Education and employee training in the host country would be much more impor-
tant for an electronics manufacturer building an Asian factory than for a firm that is simply 
planning to export American-made products.

The choice of which markets to enter usually follows extensive research focusing 
on local demand for the firm’s products, availability of needed resources, and ability of the 
local workforce to produce world-class quality. Other factors include existing and potential 
competition, tariff rates, currency stability, and investment barriers. A variety of government 
and other sources are available to facilitate this research process. A good starting place is the 
CIA’s World Factbook, which contains country-by-country information on geography, popu-
lation, government, economy, and infrastructure.
U.S. Department of Commerce counselors working at district offices offer a full range 
of international business advice, including computerized market data and names of business 
and government contacts in dozens of countries. As Table 4.3 shows, the Internet provides 
access to many resources for international trade information.
Levels of Involvement
After a firm has completed its research and decided to do business overseas, it can 
choose one or more strategies:
 
• exporting or importing
 • entering into contractual agreements such as franchising, licensing, and subcontracting deals
 • direct investment in the foreign market through acquisitions, joint ventures, or establish-
ment of an overseas division.
Although the company’s risk increases with the level of its involvement, so does its over-
all control of all aspects of producing and selling its goods or services.

Hycrete Inc., a U.S. firm that makes waterproof and corrosion-resistant building materi-
als, is both green and global. Its environmentally friendly products, which reduce reliance on 
petroleum-based products for waterproofing, are manufactured overseas for use in structures in 
India and eastern Europe. Folbot Inc., based in Charleston, South Carolina, has been making 
kayaks and folding boats for more than 75 years. Recently faced with flat U.S. sales, it signed 
exclusive distribution deals in Sweden and Norway that helped double its percentage of inter-
national sales. Folbot has also worked with UPS to reduce shipping costs, which its overseas

Importers and Exporters When a firm brings in goods produced abroad to 
sell domestically, it is an importer. Conversely, companies are exporters when they 
produce—or purchase—goods at home and sell them in overseas markets. An importing or 
exporting strategy provides the most basic level of international involvement, with the least 
risk and control.
Fuel Systems Solutions Inc. is a U.S. firm headquartered in New York that provides 
propane and natural gas fuel systems and components for use in industry and transportation. 
It has sales facilities on five continents and distributors and dealers in more than 
70 countries.29
Exports are frequently handled by special intermediaries called export trading compa-
nies. These firms search out competitively priced local merchandise and then resell it abroad 
at prices high enough to cover expenses and earn profits. When a retail chain such as Dallas-
based Pier 1 Imports wants to purchase West African products for its store shelves, it may 
contact an export trading company operating in a country such as Ghana. The local firm is 
responsible for monitoring quality, packaging the order for transatlantic shipment, arranging 
transportation, and arranging for completion of customs paperwork and other steps required 
to move the product from Ghana to the United States.
Firms engage in exporting of two types: indirect and direct. A company engages in indi-
rect exporting when it manufactures a product, such as an electronic component, that becomes 
part of another product sold in foreign markets. The second method, direct exporting, occurs 
when a company seeks to sell its products in markets outside its own country. Often the first 
step for companies entering foreign markets, direct exporting is the most common form of 
international business. Firms that succeed at this may then move to other strategies. Crops 
are imported and exported globally. 
In addition to reaching foreign markets by dealing with export trading companies, 
exporters may choose two other alternatives: export management companies and offset 
agreements. Rather than simply relying on an export trading company to assist in foreign 
markets, an exporting firm may turn to an export management company for advice and exper-
tise. These international specialists help the exporter complete paperwork, make contacts 
with local buyers, and comply with local laws governing labeling, product safety, and perfor-
mance testing. At the same time, the exporting firm retains much more control than would 
be possible with an export trading company.
An offset agreement matches a small business with a major international firm. It basically 
makes the small firm a subcontractor to the larger one. Such an entry strategy helps a new 
exporter by allowing it to share in the larger company’s international expertise. The small 
firm also benefits in such important areas as international transaction documents and financ-
ing, while the larger company benefits from the local expertise and capabilities of its smaller 
partner.
Countertrade A sizable share of international trade involves payments made in the 
form of local products, not currency. This system of international bartering agreements is 
called countertrade.
A common reason for resorting to international barter is inadequate access to needed 
foreign currency. To complete an international sales agreement, the seller may agree to 
accept part or all of the purchase cost in merchandise rather than currency. Because the 
seller may decide to locate a buyer for the bartered goods before completing the trans-
action, a number of international buyers and sellers frequently join together in a single 
agreement.
countertrade barter 
agreement whereby trade 
between two or more 
nations involves payment 
made in the form of local 
products instead of currency.

Chapter 4  Competing in World Markets
129
Countertrade may often be a firm’s only opportunity to enter a particular market. 
Many developing countries simply cannot obtain enough credit or financial assistance to 
afford the imports that their people want. Countries with heavy debt burdens also resort 
to countertrade. Russian buyers, whose currency is often less acceptable to foreign traders 
than the stronger currencies of countries such as the United States, Great Britain, Japan, 
and EU countries, may resort to trading local products ranging from crude oil to diamonds 
to vodka as payments for purchases from foreign companies unwilling to accept Russian 
rubles. Still, other countries such as China may restrict imports. Under such circumstances, 
countertrade may be the only practical way to win government approval to import needed 
products.
Contractual Agreements Once a company, large or small, gains some experi-
ence in international sales, it may decide to enter into contractual agreements with local par-
ties. These arrangements can include franchising, foreign licensing, and subcontracting.
Franchising Common among U.S. companies, franchising can work well for compa-
nies seeking to expand into international markets, too. A franchise, as described in detail in 
Chapter 5, is a contractual agreement in which a wholesaler or retailer (the franchisee) gains 
the right to sell the franchisor’s products under that company’s brand name if it agrees to 
the related operating requirements. The franchisee can also receive marketing, management, 
and business services from the franchisor. While these arrangements are common among 
leading fast-food brands such as McDonald’s and KFC, other kinds of service providers also 
often look to franchising as an international marketplace option.
Domino’s Pizza has expanded to more than 8,000 stores in more than 60 international 
markets around the world. Its largest international market is in Mexico, but wherever it 
operates, the company fine-tunes its menus to meet local tastes with such specialties as bar-
becued chicken in the Bahamas, black bean sauce in Guatemala, squid in Japan, and chorizo 
in Mexico.30
Foreign Licensing In a foreign licensing agreement, one firm allows another 
to produce or sell its product, or use its trademark, patent, or manufacturing processes, in a 
specific geographical area. In return, the firm gets a royalty or other compensation.
Licensing can be advantageous for a small manufacturer eager to launch a well-known 
product overseas. Not only does it get a proven product from another market, but little or 
no investment is required to begin operating. The arrangement can also allow entry into a 
market otherwise closed to imports due to government restrictions. Sometimes a licensing 
agreement can ensure product freshness by allowing manufacturing to take place in the local 
market. Morinaga, a Japanese food manufacturer, holds licenses to produce Lipton teas, 
Kraft cheeses, and Sunkist fruit drinks and desserts in Japan.31
Subcontracting The third type of contractual agreement, subcontracting, 
involves hiring local companies to produce, distribute, or sell goods or services. This move 
allows a foreign firm to take advantage of the subcontractor’s expertise in local culture, 
contacts, and regulations. Subcontracting works equally well for mail-order companies, 
which can farm out order fulfillment and customer service functions to local businesses. 
Manufacturers practice subcontracting to save money on import duties and labor costs, and 
businesses go this route to market products best sold by locals in a given country. Some 
firms, such as Maryland-based Pacific Bridge Medical, help medical manufacturers find reli-
able subcontractors and parts suppliers in Asia.

A key disadvantage of subcontracting is that companies cannot always control their 
subcontractors’ business practices. Several major U.S. companies have been embarrassed by 
reports that their subcontractors used child labor to manufacture clothing.
Offshoring While it is not generally considered a way of initiating business interna-
tionally, offshoring, or the relocation of business processes to a lower-cost location overseas, 
has become a widespread practice. China has emerged as the preferred destination for pro-
duction offshoring and India for services offshoring. Many business leaders argue, in favor of 
offshoring, that global firms must keep their costs as low as possible to remain competitive. 
But the apparent link between jobs sent overseas and jobs lost at home has made the practice 
controversial. Legislatures of various states have tried to slow the tide of offshoring through 
new laws, but many observers believe the real goal should be to improve corporate research 
and development efforts in the United States.
Offshoring shows no signs of slowing down, but it is changing, particularly for manu-
facturers. Mexico, India, and Vietnam are now the countries with the lowest manufacturing 
costs. “There was huge momentum and almost herd behavior around going to China back in 
2005 or 2006,” says one consultant. “China was more competitive than other low-cost coun-
tries and had more infrastructure. Now, some of that has changed. Rising transportation 
costs and material costs, which hurt China in 2007 and 2008, applied to a much lesser degree 
in Mexico.” If companies are manufacturing abroad to sell to foreign markets, offshoring 
may make more sense than making heavy or bulky products abroad and transporting them 
to North American markets for sale. Time in transport is also a factor. Not surprisingly, 
maintaining flexibility by offshoring to a few different low-cost locations may be U.S. firms’ 
lowest-risk strategy for the future. “If the rupee strengthens,” says the consultant, “you can 
shift some work to Vietnam. If transportation costs go crazy, you can move some more work 
to Mexico.”32
International Direct Investment Investing directly in production and mar-
keting operations in a foreign country is the ultimate level of global involvement. Over time, 
a firm may become successful at conducting business in other countries through exporting 
and contractual agreements. Its managers may then decide to establish manufacturing facili-
ties in those countries, open branch offices, or buy ownership interests in local companies. 
Toyota is a good example, with car manufacturing plants in countries outside Japan, includ-
ing the United States. See the “Hit & Miss” feature for a description of Toyota’s recent 
public relations problems when it recalled millions of cars.
In an acquisition, a company purchases another existing firm in the host country. An 
acquisition permits a largely domestic business operation to gain an international presence 
very quickly. Polaris Industries Inc., a U.S. firm, recently acquired Swissauto Powersports, a 
Swiss designer of high-performance engines for recreational and racing vehicles founded in 
1987. The two companies had a long history of partnering together, but the acquisition will 
brighten Polaris’s international profile. It “directly supports our stated objectives to be the 
best in powersports and a global market leader,” said Polaris’s CEO.33
Joint ventures allow companies to share risks, costs, profits, and management responsi-
bilities with one or more host country nationals. By setting up an overseas division, a company 
can conduct a significant amount of its business overseas. This strategy differs from that of 
a multinational company in that a firm with overseas divisions remains primarily a domestic

From Multinational Corporation to Global Business
A multinational corporation (MNC) is an organization with significant foreign 
operations. As Table 4.4 shows, firms headquartered in the United States make up half 
the list of the world’s largest multinationals. The Netherlands and the United Kingdom 
each have two companies on the list, and Japan rounds out the top ten, with one com-
pany on the list.
Many U.S. multinationals, including Nike and Walmart, have expanded their overseas 
operations because they believe that domestic markets are peaking and foreign markets offer 
greater sales and profit potential. Other MNCs are making substantial investments in devel-
oping countries in part because these countries provide low-cost labor compared with the 
United States and western Europe. In addition, many MNCs are locating high-tech facilities 
in countries with large numbers of technical school graduates.
Developing a Strategy 
for International Business
In developing a framework in which to conduct international business, managers must 
first evaluate their corporate objectives, organizational strengths and weaknesses, and strate-
gies for product development and marketing. They can choose to combine these elements in 
either a global strategy or a multidomestic strategy.

Toyota Motor Company grew dramatically in the last decade, dou-
bling production capacity in its drive to become the world’s top auto-
maker. While rapid growth doesn’t excuse the recent recall of millions 
of Toyotas worldwide due to faulty accelerator pedals, it could help 
explain why the public relations aspect of the recall made the revered 
company stumble so badly.
“What they did this week, they should’ve done last. . . . You want 
to rip off that Band-Aid all at once,” said one public relations expert. 
Instead, Toyota first denied the accelerator pedals were mechanically 
flawed and insisted customers had incorrectly installed their floor mats, 
interfering with the pedals’ operation. But even when the problem 
became clear, Toyota was slow to react. Customers were left confused 
and angry as they waited for information and repairs.
Finally CEO Akio Toyoda told the world, “I apologize from the bot-
tom of my heart for all the concern that we have given to so many of 
our customers.” Writing in the Washington Post, he also said, “We have 
not lived up to the high standards you have come to expect from us. 
I am deeply disappointed by that and apologize. As the president of 
Toyota, I take personal responsibility.”
Time will tell whether the world’s number-one automaker can 
recover from what one observer called “the worst-handled auto recall 
in history,” a debacle that will cost Toyota more than $2 billion in 
repairs and lost sales.

owners?

Global Business Strategies
In a global business (or standardization) strategy, a firm sells the same product in 
essentially the same manner throughout the world. Many companies simply modify their 
domestic business strategies by translating promotional brochures and product-use instruc-
tions into the languages of the host nations.
A global marketing perspective can be appropriate for some goods and services and 
certain market segments that are common to many nations. The approach works for prod-
ucts with nearly universal appeal, for luxury items such as jewelry and for commodities like 
chemicals and metals. Alcoa, for instance, is the world’s biggest producers of aluminum for 
markets that include aerospace, automotive, building and construction, consumer electron-
ics, packaging, and commercial transportation. Because in many applications aluminum’s 
strength and light weight mean there are no good substitutes for it, the company forecasts a 
long-term increase in global demand, especially in China, India, Russia, the Middle East, and 
Latin America. It also sees itself as committed to a global strategy that incorporates sustain-
ability, meaning it will “build financial success, environmental excellence, and social respon-
sibility through partnerships in order to deliver net long-term benefits to our shareowners, 
employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which we operate.”34
Multidomestic Business Strategies
Under a multidomestic business (or adaptation) strategy, the firm treats each 
national market in a different way. It develops products and marketing strategies that appeal 
to the customs, tastes, and buying habits of particular national markets. Companies that

neglect the global nature of the Internet can unwittingly cause 
problems for potential customers by failing to adapt their 
strategy. European consumers, for instance, were at first hesi-
tant to adopt online ordering of products ranging from books 
to railroad tickets. But in recent years, Internet use in western 
Europe has grown dramatically. Companies as diverse as the 
European divisions of Amazon.com; Egg PLC of London, an 
online financial services company; and the French national 
railroad have seen the numbers of visitors to their Web sites 
climbing, along with Internet revenues.
What’s Ahead
Examples in this chapter indicate that both large and 
small businesses are relying on world trade, not just major 
corporations. Chapter 5 examines the special advantages and 
challenges that small-business owners encounter. In addition, 
a critical decision facing any new business is the choice of the most appropriate form of 
business ownership. Chapter 5 also examines the major ownership structures—sole propri-
etorship, partnership, and corporation—and assesses the pros and cons of each. The chapter 
closes with a discussion of recent trends affecting business ownership, such as the growing 
impact of franchising and business consolidations through mergers and acquisitions.
Summary of Learning Objectives
Explain the importance of international business and the 
primary reasons nations trade, and discuss the concepts of 
absolute and comparative advantage in international trade.
The United States is both the world’s largest importer 
and the largest exporter, although less than 5 percent of 
the world’s population lives within its borders. With the 
increasing globalization of the world’s economies, the 
international marketplace offers tremendous opportunities 
for U.S. and foreign businesses to expand into new mar-
kets for their goods and services. Doing business globally 
provides new sources of materials and labor. Trading with 
other countries also reduces a company’s dependence on 
economic conditions in its home market. Countries that 
encourage international trade enjoy higher levels of eco-
nomic activity, employment, and wages than those that 
restrict it.
Nations usually benefit if they specialize in producing 
certain goods or services. A country has an absolute advan-
tage if it holds a monopoly or produces a good or service at 
a lower cost than other nations. It has a comparative advantage 
if it can supply a particular product more efficiently or at a 
lower cost than it can produce other items.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 Why do nations trade? Nations trade because trading 
boosts economic growth by providing a market for products 
and access to needed resources. This makes production and 
distribution systems more efficient and reduces dependence 
on the economy of the domestic market.
1.2 Cite some measures of the size of the interna-
tional marketplace. Although developing countries have 
lower per-capita incomes than developed nations in North 
America and western Europe, their populations are large and 
growing. China’s population is about 1.3 billion and India’s 
is roughly 1.1 billion.
1.3 How does a nation acquire a comparative advan-
tage? Comparative advantage exists when a nation can sup-
ply a product more efficiently and at a lower price than it 
can supply other goods, compared with the outputs of other 
countries.

Describe how nations measure international trade and the 
significance of exchange rates.
Countries measure the level of international trade by com-
paring exports and imports and then calculating whether 
a trade surplus or a deficit exists. This is the balance of 
trade, which represents the difference between exports and 
imports. The term balance of payments refers to the overall 
flow of money into or out of a country, including overseas 
loans and borrowing, international investments, and prof-
its from such investments. An exchange rate is the value 
of a nation’s currency relative to the currency of another 
nation. Currency values typically fluctuate, or “float,” rela-
tive to the supply and demand for specific currencies in the 
world market. When the value of the dollar falls compared 
with other currencies, the cost paid by foreign businesses 
and households for U.S. products declines, and demand 
for exports may rise. An increase in the value of the dol-
lar raises the prices of U.S. products sold abroad, but it 
reduces the prices of foreign products sold in the United 
States.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 Compare balance of trade and balance of payments. 
Balance of trade is the difference between exports and 
imports; balance of payments is the overall flow of money 
into or out of a country.
2.2 Explain the function of an exchange rate. A nation’s 
exchange rate is the rate at which its currency can be 
exchanged for the currencies of other nations to make it 
easier for them to trade with one another.
2.3 What happens when a currency is devalued? 
Devaluation describes a fall in a currency’s value relative to 
other currencies or to a fixed standard.
Identify the major barriers that confront global businesses.
Businesses face several obstacles in the global marketplace. 
Companies must be sensitive to social and cultural differences, 
such as languages, values, and religions, when operating in 
other countries. Economic differences include standard-of-
living variations and levels of infrastructure development. 
Legal and political barriers are among the most difficult to 
judge. Each country sets its own laws regulating business 
practices. Trade restrictions such as tariffs and administrative 
barriers also present obstacles to international business.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 How might values and attitudes form a barrier to 
trade, and how can they be overcome? Marked differ-
ences in values and attitudes, such as religious attitudes, can 
form barriers between traditionally capitalist countries and 
those adapting new capitalist systems. Many of these can be 
overcome by learning about and respecting such differences.
3.2 What is a tariff? What is its purpose? A tariff is a sur-
charge or duty charged on foreign products. Its purpose is to 
protect domestic producers of those items.
3.3 Why is dumping a problem for companies market-
ing goods internationally? Dumping is selling products 
abroad at prices below the cost of production or exporting 
products at a lower price than charged in the home market. 
It drives the cost of products sharply down in the market 
where they are dumped, thus hurting the domestic produc-
ers of those products.
Explain how international trade organizations and eco-
nomic communities reduce barriers to international trade.
Many international organizations seek to promote interna-
tional trade by reducing barriers among nations. Examples 
include the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, and 
the International Monetary Fund. Multinational economic 
communities create partnerships to remove barriers to the 
flow of goods, capital, and people across the borders of 
members. Three such economic agreements are the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA-DR, and the 
European Union.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 What international trade organization suc-
ceeded GATT, and what is its goal? The World Trade 
Organization (WTO) succeeded GATT with the goal of mon-
itoring GATT agreements, mediating disputes, and continu-
ing the effort to reduce trade barriers throughout the world.
4.2 Compare and contrast the goals of the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund. The World Bank 
funds projects that build or expand nations’ infrastructure 
such as transportation, education, and health systems and 
facilities. The International Monetary Fund makes short-
term loans to member nations that are unable to meet their 
budgets. The fund operates as a lender of last resort.
4.3 What are the goals of the European Union, and 
how do they promote international trade? The European 
Union’s goals include promoting economic and social prog-
ress, introducing European citizenship as a complement to 
national citizenship, and giving the EU a significant role in 
international affairs. Unifying standards and laws is expected 
to contribute to international trade and economic growth.
Compare the different levels of involvement used by busi-
nesses when entering global markets.
Exporting and importing, the first level of involvement in 
international business, involves the lowest degree of both 
risk and control. Companies may rely on export trading or 
management companies to help distribute their products. 
Contractual agreements such as franchising, foreign licensing, 
and subcontracting offer additional options. Franchising and

licensing are especially appropriate for services. Companies 
may also choose local subcontractors to produce goods for 
local sales. International direct investment in production and 
marketing facilities provides the highest degree of control but 
also the greatest risk. Firms make direct investments by acquir-
ing foreign companies or facilities, forming joint ventures with 
local firms and setting up their own overseas divisions.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 Name three possible strategies for beginning 
overseas business operations. Strategies are exporting 
or importing; contractual agreements such as franchising, 
licensing, or subcontracting; and making direct investments 
in foreign markets through acquisition, joint venture, or 
establishment of an overseas division.
5.2 What is countertrade? Countertrade consists of pay-
ments made in the form of local products, not currency.
5.3 Compare and contrast licensing and subcontracting. 
In a foreign licensing agreement, one firm allows another 
to produce or sell its product or use its trademark, patent, 
or manufacturing process in a specific geographical area in 
return for royalty payments or other compensations. In sub-
contracting a firm hires local companies abroad to produce, 
distribute, or sell its goods and services.
5.4 Describe joint ventures. Joint ventures allow compa-
nies to share risks, costs, profits, and management responsi-
bilities with one or more host-country nationals.
Distinguish between a global business strategy and a mul-
tidomestic business strategy.
A company that adopts a global (or standardization) strat-
egy develops a single, standardized product and marketing 
strategy for implementation throughout the world. The firm 
sells the same product in essentially the same manner in all 
countries in which it operates. Under a multidomestic (or 
adaptation) strategy, the firm develops a different treatment 
for each foreign market. It develops products and marketing 
strategies that appeal to the customs, tastes, and buying hab-
its of particular nations.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 What is a global business strategy? What are its 
advantages? A global business strategy specifies a standard-
ized competitive strategy in which the firm sells the same 
product in essentially the same manner throughout the 
world. It works well for goods and services that are common 
to many nations and allows the firm to market them without 
making significant changes.
6.2 What is a multidomestic business strategy? What 
are its advantages? A multidomestic business strategy 
allows the firm to treat each foreign market in a different 
way to appeal to the customs, tastes, and buying habits of 
particular national markets. It allows the firm to customize 
its marketing appeals for individual cultures or areas.

Google and Facebook Face Off in India’s 
Social Networking Wars
 India is the world’s largest democracy and, with 1.2 
billion people, the second-most populous country (after 
China). It is considered a major growth Internet market, 
with a tradition of free speech, a growing middle class 
that is still discovering the Internet (only about 5 percent 
of the Indian population is online so far), and huge market 
opportunities for providers of Web search and advertising.
Orkut, owned by Google, has long been India’s most 
popular social networking site, growing 35 percent a year 
and averaging 15 to 16 million unique visitors a month. 
Facebook, its closest rival, was launched around the same 
time in 2004. Despite steady growth, Facebook has since 
been running a fairly distant second to Orkut, recently 
reaching 7.5 to 8.2 million visitors a month. But Facebook 
has been turning up the heat in the social networking 
wars, and in one recent month it gained 700,000 visitors. 
Orkut’s numbers dropped by 800,00 for the same month, 
the largest dip in a year. Many observers of India’s Internet 
scene believe these two statistics signal a leap forward for 
Facebook that may put it on track to soon surpass Google’s 
Orkut as India’s premier online social network.
In fact, Facebook grew its audience about 230 per-
cent in one recent year. What accounts for its success? 
One factor is a special software tool the site is promoting 
to let new users easily import their friends from Orkut 
and other sites. The tool speeds the process of establish-
ing a Facebook presence and was created especially for 
Orkut. Facebook is also available in a number of widely 
used Indian languages, including Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, 
Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam. And Facebook hired away 
a top Google advertising executive and has been buying 
ads on Google’s India portal. Finally, a “lite” version of 
Facebook, designed for users in developing countries that 
have limited access to high-speed Internet connections, 
was also added recently.
Meanwhile, Google faces some potential problems in 
India that are common to many multinational and Internet 
companies. Fearing a backlash in the midst of emotional 
public mourning for an Indian official killed in a helicopter 
crash, it recently removed offensive comments posted 
about him on Orkut, along with the entire user group 
to which they were posted. Says one leading India civil 
liberties lawyer, “Communal tensions become largely an 
excuse for denial of civil liberties and denial of freedom of 
speech. It’s a very thin line that’s being tread.”
“In those gray areas it is really hard,” agrees 
Google’s deputy general counsel. Company policy is to 
review posted material that Orkut users have flagged. 
Anything that violates its global bans on child pornogra-
phy and hate speech, or the laws of the country in which 
it is operating, is removed. 
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Do you think Facebook can become India’s lead-
ing social networking site? Why or why not? 
What else can Facebook do to ensure success?
2. How well do you think Google is handling the 
problem of censoring content on its interna-
tional sites such as Orkut? How do you think its 
solutions of these problems affect its plans to 
keep ahead of Facebook?

Case 4.1
TOMS Shoes Takes One Step at a Time
On a trip to Argentina, a young U.S. entrepreneur 
named Blake Mycoskie saw firsthand how a simple pair 
of shoes, beyond the means of many of the world’s poor, 
could provide everything from the ability to attend school 
to protection from life-threatening infections. Moved by the 
experience, Mycoskie had a striking insight: that a revenue-
based business was more likely than a charity to sustain 
itself over the long term. And so TOMS Shoes was born.
TOMS Shoes, which stands for “tomorrow’s shoes,” 
makes simple, lightweight, and inexpensive but stylish

shoes with a unique business model called One for One. 
For every pair it sells, TOMS gives a pair of shoes away 
to a child in need somewhere in the world. In just a few 
years it has given away some 400,000 pairs of shoes to 
kids in Argentina, South Africa, Ethiopia, and the United 
States, among other countries. Some were able to own 
shoes for the first time in their lives. “When you give some 
of these children a pair of shoes,” says Mycoskie, “ . . . 
it is like a prized possession. It’s not an accessory. It’s a 
necessity, really.”
To those who have difficulty understanding his busi-
ness model, Mycoskie tells this story: “I got to meet Bill 
Gates. And he said, ‘You know, 50 percent of the infec-
tious diseases in the world can be prevented by two things. 
Toilets and shoes. So, keep doing what you’re doing.’”
With only 50 full-time employees and a crew of 
enthusiastic volunteers, TOMS recently turned its first 
profit, in a year in which it hoped to give away another 
300,000 pairs. “I think the word ‘social entrepreneur’ is 
a really good description of what I am,” says Mycoskie, 
whose title at TOMS is chief shoe giver. “What that means 
to me is that you have the entrepreneurial gift and spirit 
to create something out of nothing. . . . But you do it for 
other reasons than just make a profit. You do it for the 
social well being and the betterment of whoever you’re 
focusing on.”
TOMS’ current focus is on preventing a debilitating 
soil-borne disease, common in Ethiopia, which attacks the 
lymphatic system, effectively isolating its victims who are 
mostly women and children. “They don’t have to get it,” 
says Mycoskie of the disease. “If they wear shoes, they’ll 
never get it.”
To give away more shoes, of course, TOMS must 
sell more. Its products have been featured in Teen Vogue, 
Marie Claire, Star, and LA Confidential magazines and promoted 
through “shoe drops,” a pop-up store (a temporary retail 
outlet backed by a marketing blitz), fashion shows, cam-
pus appearances, and other trendy events. The company 
has extended its original canvas espadrilles (modeled on 
Argentinean alpargatas), to include more styles and colors 
for men and women, and a kids’ line called Youth TOMS. 
Mycoskie, who recently gave away most of his 
possessions to live on a small sailboat docked on the

Questions for Critical Thinking 
1. Do you think TOMS’ One for One business 
model is sustainable in the long term? Why or 
why not?
2. Mycoskie says his customers provide “the best 
type of marketing you can have” because when 
asked about their footwear, “they never say 
‘TOMS.’ They tell the whole story. They say, 
‘When I bought this pair of shoes, a child got a 
pair.’” What lesson do you think other socially 
responsible firms can learn from TOMS’ business 
practices?

Smart Design:  Life Is In the Details
CASE 1.3
Case 4.3
When you peel a potato or run your pizza cutter 
through to cut a slice, it’s likely that you only notice the 
tool you are using if it doesn’t work—if it sticks or snags, 
gouges the potato or tears the pizza crust. The team at 
Smart Design doesn’t mind not being noticed. They oper-
ate quietly behind the scenes, developing a wide range of 
designs for products made and sold by companies around 
the world. They come up with designs that make every-
thing from toothbrushes to automobiles function better 
in human hands. Smart Design engineers developed the 
popular OXO Good Grips line of kitchen utensils as well 
as the SmartGauge instrument cluster for the Ford Fusion 
Hybrid.
“Smart Design is about designing products for people 
in their everyday life,” explains Richard Whitehall, vice 
president of industrial design for Smart Design. “There are 
little things you might see in a product that you’d think, 
‘I wish I’d thought of that—it’s a great idea.’” Sometimes 
it’s the simplest or smallest detail in the engineering of a 
product that makes a difference in whether consumers will 

Chapter 4  Competing in World Markets

continue to use the product or purchase it again. Smart 
Design tries to make products that work well universally 
for a wide range of people in different situations. This 
is where the global challenge comes in—differences in 
cultural preferences, product use, language, and other 
factors can make universal product development difficult. 
But Smart Design has offices in both the U.S. and abroad, 
with testing locations in Europe and Asia, and employees 
representing more than 20 different countries.
Ted Booth, director of interactive design says, 
“Interactive design is anything with a ‘chip’ in it. I can’t 
imagine approaching interactive design without a global 
perspective.” Booth explains how Smart Design develops 
the design for a mobile phone. “The way people use it 
varies from country to country,” he notes. “So what might 
look like a new feature in one country is really old hat in 
another.” Booth observes that it is very common for con-
sumers in Finland and South Korea to pay for most goods 
and services from their mobile phones, whereas this is not 
a common practice among U.S. consumers. Some of this 
practice is driven by industry standards, but much of it has 
to do with cultural expectations. “It’s important to have 
a global perspective [in design] so you know the trends in 
other countries. You need to design and shape the experi-
ence to hit the market and bring something new to the 
market, but also adapt to individual markets,” concludes 
Booth.
Booth describes his company’s work on the “Q” 
control for HP—a single navigation controller that can be 
used across all HP products, ranging from TV remotes to 
printers to cameras. Smart Design tested the Q control in 
the U.S., Germany, Spain, and South Korea. Researchers 
discovered that, while a few local adaptations were neces-
sary, there was one universal preference among all con-
sumers: everyone needed a “back” button in order to go 
forward. Booth explains that there is a universal need for 
people to know that there is an escape, undo—or back—
for every function in order for users to feel comfortable 
completing an interactive task.
Smart Design has an impressive list of worldwide 
clients, including Ford, Bell Canada, ESPN, World Kitchen, 
Microsoft, Samsung, and Kellogg’s among many others. 
The firm has won many accolades, including nationally rec-
ognized design awards. But Smart Design remains focused 
on the details. The firm recently developed the Reach 
Wondergrip children’s toothbrush for Johnson & Johnson 
when it became apparent that traditional children’s tooth-
brushes were just scaled down from the adult models. Kids 
couldn’t hold them easily and were less likely to brush 
their teeth. The new Wondergrip children’s model changed 
the industry standard for children’s toothbrushes—and 
brushing habits. Smart Design also developed a women’s 
sports watch for Nike—based on needs and preferences of 
women runners. And there’s that line of kitchen tools that 
make food preparation and cooking just a little bit easier 
and more fun. 
Richard Whitehall, who actually began his career 
working for a firm that manufactured mountaineering 
gear, describes the importance of design in every product 
used by consumers. “We were trying to think of a situ-
ation people were in and trying to design a product in a 
way that people from different countries—whether they 
were stuck in the Alps or on a boat—could use in all 
these different situations.” Whether you are climbing a 
mountain in Switzerland or cutting your pizza in Boston, 
you want your gear to work flawlessly—and that is the 
goal of Smart Design.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Ted Booth and Richard Whitehall mention some 
of the cultural barriers that Smart Design faces 
in developing products for worldwide use. Give 
examples of other barriers the firm might face 
in international trade.
2. Describe what you believe would be the best 
level of involvement for Smart Design to have 
when doing business in Europe. Remember to 
take into consideration the European Union.
3. Smart Design already has a presence in South 
Korea. How might the firm best approach 
developing products for the market in India? 
In China?
4. Do you believe it is possible to develop truly 
universal products? Why or why not?

New Ways to Be a Better Town
Greensburg, Kansas, had been struggling for years. 
Located along Highway 54, a major trucking route, the town 
was merely a pit stop for people on their way somewhere 
else. It did have a few tourist attractions: the Big Well, the 
world’s largest hand-dug well, and a 1,000-pound meteorite 
that fell from the sky in 2006.
Lonnie McCollum, the town’s mayor, had been look-
ing into ways to breathe new life into the town. McCollum 
wanted to add a little vintage charm to its quaint Main 
Street, but could not raise the money. And he had launched 
a campaign to put the “green” back in Greensburg by pro-
moting green building technology. But the idea, which many 
residents associated with hippies and tree-huggers, did not 
go over well.
Then everything changed. “My town is gone,” 
announced Town Administrator Steve Hewitt on May 5, 
2007, after surveying the damage caused by a devastat-
ing tornado. “I believe 95 percent of the homes are gone. 
Downtown buildings are gone, my home is gone.” With 
a clean slate and 700 homes to replace, Hewitt vowed to 
rebuild Greensburg using sustainable materials. He believed 
the town had a unique opportunity to control its environ-
mental impact and reduce operating costs through increased 
energy efficiency.
“What if we turned this tragedy into something beauti-
ful?” asked resident Dan Wallach in a new business plan 
he wrote shortly after the disaster. Wallach and his wife 
had long been interested in sustainable Green living. Using 
their experience in developing nonprofits, the two launched 
Greensburg GreenTown, an organization designed to sup-
port Greensburg’s green building efforts through education, 
fund-raising, and public relations management.
One of Wallach’s favorite new projects was BTI 
Greensburg, the local John Deere dealership. Owners Kelly 
and Mike Estes had decided to replace their ruined build-
ing with an energy-efficient, technologically state-of-the-art 
showroom featuring radiant heat, solar energy, passive cool-
ing, and wind power. With corporate support from John 
Deere, BTI Greensburg would become a flagship green 
dealership.
Long-term plans for Greensburg include a business 
incubator, to help displaced businesses get back on their feet 
and bring new businesses to town; a green industrial park, 
green museum, and green school system; green building 
codes and zoning restrictions; and a community of green 
homes and businesses.
Questions
After viewing the video, answer the following questions:
1. In what ways is the town of Greensburg like any other

sible organization?
3. What might be the effects of the town’s new green 
building guidelines on residents and businesses? On the 
regional economy?
4. What kind of business is Greensburg GreenTown? How 
does its structure differ from John Deere’s?

Global Business 
and Economics Career
In Part 1, “Business in a Global 
Environment,” you learned about the 
background and current issues driv-
ing contemporary business. The part 
includes four chapters covering such 
issues as the changing face of business, 
business ethics and social responsi-
bility, economic challenges facing 
contemporary business, and compet-
ing in world markets. Business has 
always been an exciting career field, 
whether you choose to start your own 
company, work at a local business, or 
set your sights on a position with a 
multinational corporation. But today’s 
environment is especially attractive 
because businesses are expanding 
their horizons to compete in a global 
economy—and they need dedicated 
and talented people to help them 
accomplish their goals. In fact, profes-
sional and business service jobs are 
found in some of the fastest-growing 
industries in the U.S. economy and 
are projected to grow by more than 
23 percent over a decade.1 So now 
is the time to explore several differ-
ent career options that can lead you 
to your dream job. Each part in this 
text profiles the many opportunities 
available in business. Here are a few 
related to Chapters 1 through 4.
If you’re good at number crunch-
ing and are interested in how societies 
and companies function, then maybe a 
career as an economist is in your future. 
Economists study how resources are 
allocated, conduct research by collect-
ing and analyzing data, monitor eco-
nomic trends, and develop forecasts. 
They look into such vital areas as 
the cost of energy, foreign trade and 
exchange between countries, the effect 
of taxes, and employment levels—both 
from a big-picture national or global 
viewpoint and from the perspective 
of individual businesses. Economists 
work for corporations to help them 
run more efficiently, for consulting 
firms to offer special expertise, or 
for government agencies to oversee 
economic decision making. Typically, 
advanced degrees are needed to climb 
to top-level positions. Economists 
usually earn about $83,590 per year.2
Or perhaps you are interested in 
global business. Companies increas-
ingly search the world for the best 
employees, supplies, and markets. So 
you could work in the United States 
for a foreign-based firm such as Nokia 
or Toyota; abroad in Australia, Asia, 
Europe, or Latin America for a U.S.-
based firm such as Microsoft; or with 
overseas coworkers via computer net-
works to develop new products for a 
firm such as General Electric. With 
technology and telecommunications, 
distance is no longer a barrier to 
conducting business. Global business 
careers exist in all the areas you’ll be 
reading about in this text—business 
ownership, management, marketing, 
technology, and finance.
Global business leaders are not 
born but made—so how can you start 
on that career path? Here are the 
three areas that businesses consider 
when selecting employees for overseas 
assignment:
 • competence—including technical 
knowledge, language skills, lead-
ership ability, experience, and past 
performance
 • adaptability—including interest in 
overseas work, communication 
and other personal skills, empathy 
for other cultures, and apprecia-
tion for varied management styles 
and work environments
 • personal characteristics—level of 
education, experience, and social 
compatibility with the host coun-
try.3
Solid experience in your field or 
company ranks at the top of the list 
of needed skills. Firms want to send 
employees who have expertise in 
their business and loyalty to the firm 
to represent them overseas. Those 
who obtain their master’s of busi-
ness administration (MBA) degree 
are reaping rewards financially: in 
a recent year, the average salary for 
MBA graduates a few years out of 
school reached $126,000.4 Companies 
are reluctant to send new graduates 
abroad immediately. Instead, they 
invest in training to orient employees 
to the new assignment.
Knowledge of and interest 
in other languages and cultures 
is the second-highest priority. 
Businesspeople need to function 
smoothly in another society, so they 
are selected based on their familiar-
ity with other languages and cultures. 
Because China is a business hotspot, 

Part 1  Business in a Global Environment
142
some people have become fluent in 
Mandarin Chinese to boost their 
career prospects. Also, some school 
systems are offering Chinese language 
classes in addition to their standard 
offerings of Spanish, French, German, 
and Russian.
Finally, employees are evaluated 
on their personal characteristics to be 
certain that they will fit well in their 
new country. A person’s talent is still 
foremost in making assignments, but 
executives with cross-cultural skills are 
in high demand.5
Career Assessment Exercises in 
Economics and Global Business
1. With the ups and downs in the 
U.S. economy, economists have 
been highlighted in the news. 
The head of the Federal Reserve, 
Benjamin Bernanke, has been 
managing the country’s general 
financial condition. To get an 
idea of the role economists play 
in a federal government agency, 
research Bernanke’s background 
and qualifications. Assess how he is 
performing at the Fed. Now make 
a list of your own skills. Where is 
there a match of your skills to his? 
What do you need to change?
2. To see the effect of the global 
economy in your community, go to 
a major retailer. Look at the num-
ber of different countries represent-
ed in the products on the shelves. 
Compare your list with those of 
your classmates to see who found 
the most countries and what goods 
those countries provided. Go online 
to research the career opportunities 
at the retailer’s Web site.
3. To learn more about other coun-
tries, do research online for a 
country in which you are inter-
ested. Here are some sources that 
may be useful:
 • The World Factbook, published by 
the Central Intelligence Agency, 
https://www.cia.gov/library/ 
publications/the-world-fact-
book/. This publication, updat-
ed yearly, contains a wealth of 
information about countries—
geography and climate, popula-
tion statistics, cultural and 
political information, transporta-
tion and communications meth-
ods, and economic data.
 • BusinessWeek magazine, http://
www.businessweek.com. The 
Web site has links to Asia and 
Europe, where you can explore 
breaking news or information 
on global companies.
 • Online news sites Yahoo! News 
and Google News, http://
news.yahoo.com and http://
news.google.com. Both of 
these online news sites have 
links to global business news. 
The Yahoo! site has a link for 
“Business” and then “Global 
Economy.” The Google site has 
a “Business” link and then lists 
sites for many countries and 
many languages.
Write a one-page summary of 
what you found. Make a list of abili-
ties you would need to function well 
as a businessperson in that country. 
Concentrate on the areas of compe-
tence, adaptability, and personal char-
acteristics. Now formulate a plan to 
gain those skills.

S.C. Johnson: A Large Company 
with Small Beginnings
 N  early every business comes from humble 
beginnings. Some firms remain small, while others—
such as Walmart, Toyota, and Microsoft—grow 
large and dominate their industries and markets 
worldwide. S.C. Johnson is one such company.
Samuel Curtis Johnson owned several businesses 
before starting the one that made him famous. In 
the mid-1880s, Johnson invested half his salary 
in the development of a new railway that failed. 
Several years later he became a partner in a book 
and stationery store but that, too, folded. When 
Johnson was nearly 50 years old, he moved to 
Wisconsin as a parquet floor salesman, bought the 
business, and began to show a profit. Meanwhile, 
he received letters from customers asking for tips 
on how to clean and polish their new wood floors. 
Johnson did the next best thing. He rolled up his 
shirtsleeves, leaned over his cast iron bathtub, and 
began to mix up his own concoction of floor wax. 
More than 100 years later, Johnson’s Wax is still a 
staple in many homes.
Five generations later, H. Fisk Johnson is the 
current chairman and CEO of S.C. Johnson. Fisk 
Johnson grew up hearing generations of stories 
about the company and his family and earned 
degrees in chemistry, engineering and physics, 
as well as business. Perhaps because of his focus 
on science—and his dedication to his family’s 
firm—Johnson began steering the firm toward 
cutting-edge technology that would result in an 
award-winning commitment to the environment. 
Household cleaners such as Pledge, Drano, 
Windex, and Shout, along with air fresheners like 
Glade and Oust, and pesticides like Raid and Off, 
traditionally contain harmful chemicals. But about 
a decade ago, S.C. Johnson made a commitment 
to identifying and classifying all the ingredients in 
its products, as well as aggressively researching 
chemicals that are better for both the environment 
and consumers. This commitment has led to a recent 
announcement that the firm has now reached full 
ingredient transparency, posting the ingredients of 
200 products on a special link to its Web site—
ahead of schedule. Soon all of the information 
will be available in Spanish as well. “Transparency 
doesn’t mean cherry-picking which things to share 
and which things to hide,” notes Fisk Johnson. 
“We have already included in our ingredient 
communications the dyes we use in products, and 
we’re committed to [sharing] the ingredients and 
preservatives as well.” In addition, the firm has 
developed a new line of natural plant-based cleaners 
called Nature’s Source.
This type of laser focus on a single issue may 
seem unusual for a large firm like S.C. Johnson. 
But because the company is still family owned 
and managed, its executives can make certain 
decisions more quickly and freely than they could 
if the firm were publicly held by stockholders. The 
company avoided being named in a lawsuit with 
other manufacturers by the public interest law firm 
Earthjustice because when the law firm approached 
Johnson about the ingredients in its products, the 
company was quick to ask what it could do to 
comply with new standards.
Overseas, S.C. Johnson has made a major effort 
toward environmentally responsible manufacturing 
at its plants in Europe and Indonesia. Recently the 
company flipped the switch on its first owned and 
operated windmill that will power its factory in the 
Netherlands. “This wind turbine helps S.C. Johnson 
continue to reduce our emissions and energy use,” 
says Fisk Johnson. “What’s even more important 
is the end result—a better environment today and 
for future generations. And hopefully what we’ve 
accomplished here will create some momentum and 
inspire other global companies to follow suit with 
their own energy improvements.” Goals like this 
illustrate how one small business—started with a 
recipe for floor wax mixed in a bath tub—can grow 
to be a large and influential global company.1
LECTURE ENHANCER: 
Why does the fact that 
S.C. Johnson is still 
owned and operated by 
family members make it 
easier for the company to 
quickly respond to market 
pressures or concerns?

Do you hope to work for a big company 
or a small one? Do you plan to start your 
own business? If you’re thinking about 
striking out on your own, you’re not alone. 
On any given day in the United States, 
more people are in the process of starting a 
new business than getting married or 
having a baby. But before you enter the 
business world—as an employee or an 
owner—you need to understand the industry 
in which a company operates, as well as the 
size and framework of the firm’s organiza-
tion. For example, S.C. Johnson & Son is 
now a large company with many smaller 
divisions. The firm also has numerous sup-
pliers that qualify as small businesses. Yet 
all of these entities work together. It’s 
important to remember that most larger 
businesses—like Ford and Apple—began as 
small businesses.
Several variables affect the way a business 
is organized, including how easily it can be 
set up, access to financing, tolerance of finan-
cial risk, strengths and weaknesses that exist 
in competing firms, as well as the strengths 
and weaknesses of your firm.
This chapter begins by focusing on 
small-business ownership, including the 
advantages and disadvantages of small-
business ventures, the contributions of small 
business to the economy, and the reasons 
small businesses fail. The chapter examines 
the services provided by the U.S. govern-
ment’s Small Business Administration, the 
role of women and minorities in small busi-
ness, as well as alternatives for small busi-
nesses such as franchising.
The chapter then moves on to an over-
view of the forms of private business owner-
ship—sole proprietorships, partnerships, and 
corporations. In addition, the features of 
businesses owned by employees and families, 
as well as not-for-profit organizations, are 
discussed. Public and collective ownership 
are examined. The chapter concludes with an 
explanation of structures and operations typi-
cal of larger companies, and a review of the 
major types of business alliances.
Overview

Most Businesses Are 
Small Businesses
Although many people associate the term business with corporate giants such as Kraft, 
Target, Disney, and ExxonMobil, 98 percent of all U.S. companies are considered small 
businesses. These firms have generated 64 percent of new jobs during the past 15 years and 
employ more than half of all private-sector (nongovernment) workers.2 Small business is also 
the launching pad for new ideas and products. They hire 40 percent of high-tech workers 
such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers, who devote their time to developing 
new goods and services.3

What Is a Small Business?
How can you tell a small business from a large one? The Small Business Administration 
(SBA), the federal agency most directly involved with this sector of the economy, defines a 
small business as an “independent business having fewer than 500 employees.” However, 
those bidding for government contracts or applying for government assistance may vary in 
size according to industry. For example, small manufacturers fall in the 500-worker range, 
whereas wholesalers must employ fewer than 100. Retailers may generate up to $6 million in 
annual sales and still be considered small businesses, while farms or other agricultural busi-
nesses are designated small if they generate less than $750,000 annually.4
Logan Green and John Zimmer started Zimride, a California-based service that would 
let carpoolers connect with each other online. At the beginning, Zimride’s customers, who 
pay about $10,000 a year to use the platform, were mostly colleges and universities, but its 
35 clients now include Cigna and Walmart. Zimride employs six people and reports that its 
annual revenues are around $400,000—and making a profit.5 By SBA standards, Zimride is a 
small business.
Because government agencies offer benefits designed to help small businesses compete 
with larger firms, small-business owners want to determine whether their companies meet 
the standards for small-business designation. If it qualifies, a company may be eligible for 
government loans or for government purchasing programs that encourage proposals from 
smaller suppliers. With assistance like this, Zimride might eventually expand to other areas 
of the country, and eventually become a larger business.
Typical Small-Business Ventures
Small businesses have always competed against each other as well as against some of the 
world’s largest organizations. ModCloth, an online clothing retailer founded by husband-
and-wife team Eric and Susan Koger, does both. Launched while the owners were still in 
college, the business offers trendy fashions by independent designers. The Kogers say they 
compete successfully against other clothing e-tailers because they develop a close relation-
ship with designers and sell their inventory well before they have to pay for it. Their 104 
employees are mostly young women who buy the types 
of clothes ModCloth sells. Because of these relation-
ships, ModCloth can compete against other clothing 
e-tailers of any size.6
The past 15 years have seen a steady erosion of 
small businesses in some industries as larger firms have 
bought out small independent businesses and replaced 
them with larger operations. The number of indepen-
dent bookstores and hardware stores has fallen dramati-
cally as Barnes & Noble and Lowe’s have increased 
the size and number of their stores. But as Table 5.1 
reveals, the businesses least likely to be gobbled up are 
those that sell personalized services, rely on certain 
locations, and keep their overhead costs low.
Nonfarming-related small firms create more than 
half the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). In the 
past, many of these businesses focused on retailing or

a service industry such as insurance. More recently, however, small firms have carved out 
an important niche for themselves: providing busy consumers with customized services that 
range from pet-sitting to personal shopping. These businesses cater to the needs of indi-
vidual customers in a way that big firms can’t.
As Figure 5.1 shows, small businesses provide most jobs in the construction, agricul-
tural services, wholesale trade, services, and retail trade industries. Retailing to the con-
sumer is another important industry for small firms. Retailing giants such as Amazon and 
Macy’s may be the best-known firms, but smaller stores and Web sites outnumber them. 
And these small firms can be very successful, as the owners of ModCloth illustrate, often 
because they can keep their overhead expenses low.
Small business also plays a significant role in agriculture. Although most farm acreage 
is in the hands of large corporate farms, most U.S. farms are owned by individual farm-
ers or families, not partners or shareholders.7 The family farm is a classic example of a 
small- business operation. It is independently owned and operated, with a limited number of 
employees, including family members. Cider Hill Farm in Massachusetts is one such farm. 
Three generations of the Cook family operate the farm together—it produces fruit and veg-
etables, including a wide variety of cooking and eating apples from its orchards, and honey 
from its on-site beehives. In addition, Cider Hill makes its own fresh cider and cider dough-
nuts every day and operates a well-stocked country store on the property. During growing 
season, the farm hosts field trips for schools, offers hay rides, and creates a corn maze in its 
fields. All of these activities contribute to the income of the farm. The Cooks are also dedi-
cated to environmentally friendly farming technologies. Cider Hill operates three wind 
turbines and uses solar cells to help power its buildings.8

Fifty-two percent of small businesses in the United States 
are home-based businesses—firms operated from the 
residence of the business owner. There are about 16 mil-
lion such businesses in the United States.9 People who oper-
ate home-based firms often do so because this type of work 
allows them more control over their business as well as their 
personal time. Whether you’re a morning person or a night 
owl, in many cases you can structure your business hours 
accordingly. Access to the Internet and availability of com-
munications devices such as the BlackBerry and other smart 
phone technology makes it convenient to run a home-based 
business. Freedom from overhead costs such as leasing office 
or warehouse space is another major attraction of home-
based businesses. Drawbacks include isolation and less vis-
ibility to customers—except, of course, if your customers visit 
you online. In that case, they don’t care where your office is 
located.
Many small-business start-ups are more competitive 
because of the Internet. The Internet doesn’t guarantee 
success—there are so many Web sites that a small firm needs 
to find ways to make its online presence effective. But estab-
lishing a Web site is generally less expensive than opening a retail store and reaches a 
broader spectrum of potential customers. Connecticut-based eBeanstalk.com is an online 
toy store. How does this small business compete with the likes of online giants such as 
Amazon and Toys ‘R’ Us? The company specializes in learning toys that “help plant the 
seeds that help children grow.” Two teams of experts (including 700 moms) hired by 
eBeanstalk evaluate more than 10,000 toys from manufacturers, to narrow the selection 
down to around 600 of what they consider to be the best learning toys. That group 
may shrink even further. Only the selected toys are included on the site. Consumers 
appreciate this screening process, knowing they can go straight to eBeanstalk for the toys 
they want.10
American business history is filled with inspirational stories of great inventors who 
launched companies in barns, garages, warehouses, and attics. For young visionaries such as 
Apple Computer founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the logical option for transform-
ing their technical idea into a commercial reality was to begin work in a family garage. The 
impact of today’s entrepreneurs, including home-based businesses, is discussed in more 
depth in Chapter 6.
Contributions of Small 
Business to the Economy
Small businesses form the core of the U.S. economy. Businesses with fewer than 500 
employees generate more than half the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). These com-
panies account for more than 97 percent of known U.S. exporters, shipping more than 30 
percent of all exported goods overseas each year.11 Small firms are credited with U.S. com-
petitiveness in a number of world markets.12

Creating New Jobs
Small businesses make tremendous contributions to the U.S. economy and to society as a 
whole. One impressive contribution is the number of new jobs created each year by small busi-
nesses. While it varies from year to year, on average three of every four new jobs are created 
by companies with fewer than 500 employees.13 A significant share of these jobs are created by 
the smallest companies, those with four or fewer employees. Small businesses that provide ser-
vices have experienced a greater increase in new jobs than those that produce goods.14
Small businesses also contribute to the economy by hiring workers who tradition-
ally have had difficulty finding jobs at larger firms, such as women returning to the work-
force, former welfare recipients, and workers with various challenges. The Small Business 
Administration provides incentives for companies to hire these types of workers.
Even if you never plan to start your own company, you will probably work for a small 
business at some point in your career, particularly at the beginning. Small firms often hire 
the youngest workers. Table 5.2 illustrates some of the newest jobs within both traditional 
and new industries, many of which can be found in small businesses.
Creating New Industries
Small firms give businesspeople the opportunity and outlet for developing new ideas. 
Sometimes these new ideas become entirely new industries. Many of today’s largest and 
most successful firms, such as Whole Foods, Google, and Amazon, began as small busi-
nesses. Facebook co-founders Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and 
Eduardo Saverin launched their new business from their college dorm room. Within five 
years, Facebook had logged more than 300 million users and positioned itself as a leader in 
the new industry of social networking.15
New industries are sometimes created when small businesses adapt to provide needed 
services to a larger corporate community. Corporate downsizing has created a demand for 
other businesses to perform activities previously handled by in-house employees. These sup-
port businesses may become an industry themselves. The need for wireless communication

devices and services to support businesses has resulted in a proliferation of small businesses 
to fill this niche.
New industries can be created when small businesses adapt to shifts in consumer inter-
ests and preferences. For example, the idea of offering customized services to busy consum-
ers has taken root in the U.S. economy. Joanna Van Vleck offers one such service through 
her online Trunk Club. Using Web cams to meet with men who are too busy to shop for 
clothes, Van Vleck interviews her customers and assesses their clothing needs, then selects 
and ships a new wardrobe directly to them.16
Finally, new industries may be created when both the business world and consumers 
recognize a need for change. The recent emphasis on environmental responsibility—ranging 
from recycling and reuse of goods to reducing the amount of energy consumed—has fos-
tered a whole new industry of green goods and services, many produced by small companies. 
One such firm is Boston-based Emergent Energy Group, a renewable energy consulting 
business founded by Jesse Gossett and Jayson Uppal. The two created their firm to “spread 
and enhance the discussion surrounding all aspects of the transforming global energy indus-
try.” Emergent helps cities and private companies evaluate their energy use and create sus-
tainable practices.17 The “Going Green” feature describes one small-business owner who is 
pouring her passion and talent into environmentally responsible services.
Innovation
Small businesses are adept at developing new and improved goods and services. 
Innovation is often the entire reason for the founding of a new business. In a typical year, 
small firms develop twice as many product innovations per employee as larger firms. They 
also produce 13 times more patents per employee than larger firms.18

Green Mama: Small Business with a Big Message
The Green Mama isn’t a mythical figure. She’s a consultant, writer, 
and environmentalist who believes the world can be made a more 
sustainable place one mom at a time. Manda Aufochs Gillespie had 
been living and promoting an environmentally conscious lifestyle for 
several years when she was featured in a Chicago Tribune article. Suddenly, 
Gillespie became a guru for like-minded parents who simply wanted 
to improve the health and lives of their families while reducing their 
impact on the planet. Since then she has launched a Web site, 
www.thegreenmama.com; hosts a weekly playgroup/seminar for par-
ents called the Green Mama Café; writes a regular blog; consults for 
daycare businesses and educational institutions; gives workshops; 
appears on television; and provides everyday advice to consumers. 
She’s also a mom.
The Web site is the center of Gillespie’s green universe. “The site 
is for people who are trying to be green parents in any major city,” she 
explains. “It’s a tool for living.” Visitors to the site can get shopping 
tips for the best cloth diapers, learn how to clean their floors with white 
vinegar (instead of commercial cleaners), become informed about buy-
ing local produce, and get the real scoop on everything from the effec-
tiveness of hand sanitizers to the cost of organic produce. No question 
is too elementary for Gillespie. In addition, she offers suggestions for 
saving money—as well as reducing waste—such as re-gifting a gently 
used child’s garment to another child instead of buying a new piece of 
clothing for a birthday gift.
How does all of this philosophy translate to business? It’s not 
just the $5 that each mom pays to attend one of Gillespie’s work-
shops in person at the Green Mama Café, or any consulting fees she 
may charge. It’s the fact that, according to marketing experts, these 
moms represent a group of about 20 million consumers who are 
beginning to demand green goods and services. It’s not just cloth 
diapers and natural floor cleaners. These consumers are now scru-
tinizing every item they put in their reusable shopping bags. If they 
have to pay a bit more for those products, they will—because in 
many cases they are saving money elsewhere. “It turns out that what 
saves money also saves resources and what is better for the environ-
ment can also make parenting easier, if you have the right mindset,” 
says one mom who attends Gillespie’s Green Mama seminars. It is 
estimated that these green moms wield nearly $210 billion in pur-
chasing power—something that manufacturers, media, and service 
providers have begun to notice.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Manda Gillespie is part of a movement of small businesses 
that are creating a whole new industry: green goods and 
services for parents. What factors do you believe will 
contribute to the success of this movement? What pitfalls 
might they face?
2. As a consumer, have you embraced any green goods or 
services? Why or why not? Have they been offered by 
small or large companies?

Key 20th-century innovations developed by small businesses include the airplane, the 
personal computer, soft contact lenses, and the zipper. Innovations that already drive small 
businesses in the 21st century include those that fall into social networking, security, and 
green energy industries. The “Business Etiquette” feature offers tips for using online social 
networking successfully.
Why Small Businesses Fail
Small businesses play a huge role in the U.S. economy. But one of the reasons they are 
so successful is also the reason they may fail—their founders are willing to take a risk. Some 
of the most common shortcomings that plague a small firm include management inexperi-
ence, inadequate financing, and the challenge of meeting government regulations.
As Figure 5.2 shows, 7 out of every 10 new businesses survive at least two years. About 
50 percent make it to the five-year mark. But by the tenth year, 82 percent will have closed.19 
Let’s look a little more closely at why this happens.

How to Use Social Networking in Your Job Search
Online social networking is likely part of your every day life. But you can put 
this technology to powerful use when you are looking for a job. During one 
recent year, networking sites such as LinkedIn registered about 1 million new 
users per month. Worried about getting lost in the social-networking shufﬂ e? 
Use a few simple tips from the pros to help you stand out from the millions of 
other job-seekers who have discovered the beneﬁ ts of social networking.
 • Research a network before jumping in. Some networks, such as Facebook, exist 
mostly to connect friends with each other. Others, such as LinkedIn, 
have a stronger employment focus. Twitter, on the other hand, attracts 
both types of users. To adopt the right approach—and make the most 
of a site—learn something about it before you log on to search for an 
employer.
 • Complete your online proﬁ le. Help prospective employers by ﬁ lling out your 
online proﬁ le. Update your bio as frequently as possible. Provide a link to 
your own blog or Web page if you have one. Don’t try to be perfect—if 
you know your shortcomings or have made a mistake in a previous job, 
describe how you’ve improved or made the most of your decision.
 • Share information. Be willing to share information about companies or 
career opportunities with like-minded job-seekers. You can help an online 
recruiter ﬁ nd the right person—even if it’s not you.
 • Search for people. Look for companies that interest you, then try to make 
connections with friends, family members, classmates, alumni—anyone 
who might be able to help you establish contact within those companies. 
A speciﬁ c job might not be available at the moment, but a personal con-
nection could help you when that job does open up.
 • Respect privacy. Just as you only want to present certain information about 
yourself online, respect the privacy of potential employers and colleagues. 
Familiarize yourself with the privacy settings of a social networking site 
and abide by them.

Management Shortcomings
One of the most common causes of small-
business failure is the shortcomings of manage-
ment. These may include lack of people skills, 
inadequate knowledge of finance, inability to track 
inventory or sales, poor assessment of the com-
petition, or simply the lack of time to do every-
thing required. Whereas large firms often have 
the resources to recruit specialists in areas such as 
marketing and finance, the owner of a small busi-
ness often winds up wearing too many hats 
at once.
This could result in bad decision making that 
could end in the firm’s failure. Krispy Kreme 
was once a small business that expanded too fast 
as a result of poor decisions made by manage-
ment. The company’s near failure had nothing 
to do with the quality of its doughnuts. Instead, 
as the company grew bigger, so did its debt. 
Allegations of management misconduct were 
made. Meanwhile, consumers began to turn their 
attention away from doughnuts and toward more 
healthful snacks and breakfast foods produced by 
competitors. Now under new management and 
operating at a leaner size, the firm is recovering.20
Owners of small businesses can increase their 
chances of success if they become educated in the 
principles of business; know the industry in which 
they intend to operate; develop good interper-
sonal skills; understand their own limitations; hire 
motivated employees; and seek professional advice 
on issues like finance, regulations, and other legal 
matters.21
Inadequate Financing
Money is the foundation of any business. 
Every business—large or small—needs a certain 
amount of financing in order to operate, thrive, 
and grow. Another leading problem of small busi-
nesses is inadequate financing. First-time busi-
ness owners often assume that their firms will 
generate enough funds from their initial sales to 
finance continuing operations. But building a busi-
ness takes time. Products need to be developed, 
employees have to be hired, a Web site must be 
constructed, distribution has to be determined, 
office or retail space might have to be secured,

and so forth. Most small businesses—even those 
with minimal start-up costs—sometimes don’t turn a 
profit for months or even years.22
Although there are stories about business found-
ers starting firms with just a few hundred dollars 
loaned by a friend or with a cash advance from a 
credit card, commercial banks and other financial 
institutions are the largest lenders to small busi-
nesses, accounting for 65 percent of total traditional 
credit to small firms. This type of financing includes 
credit lines and loans for nonresidential mortgages, 
vehicles, specialized equipment, and leases.23
Figure 5.3 shows that despite their relatively 
high interest rates, credit cards do remain an impor-
tant source of financing for small businesses. The 
heaviest users of credit cards for business financing 
are firms with fewer than ten employees. Inadequate 
financing can compound management shortcom-
ings by making it more difficult for small businesses 
to attract and keep talented people. Typically, a big 
company can offer a better benefits package and a 
higher salary.
With less money to spend on employees, mar-
keting, inventory, and other business costs, success-
ful small companies need to be creative. Asafumi 
Yamashita started his business with $500, with which 
he bought specialty vegetable seeds from Japan. In 
his own greenhouse, he planted Japanese spinach, 
radishes, and other delicacies. Yamashita had become 
friends with the head chef at a Japanese restaurant 
in Paris, who told Yamashita that these vegetables 
were nearly impossible to obtain locally. Within a 
year of planting those first seeds, Yamashita was sup-
plying several top restaurants around Paris. Word of 
Yamashita’s high-quality vegetables spread, and he 
now supplies his crop only to the most exclusive estab-
lishments in the area. Yamashita has deliberately lim-
ited his number of customers and has no employees, 
so he needs less financing and maintains control over 
every basket of vegetables that leaves his garden.24
Government Regulation
Small-business owners cite their struggle to com-
ply with government regulations as one of the biggest 
challenges they face. Some firms fold because of this 
burden alone. Paperwork costs account for billions of 
small-business dollars each year. A large company can 
better cope with requirements for forms and reports.

Larger firms often find that it makes 
economic sense to hire or contract with 
specialists in specific types of regulation, 
such as employment law and workplace 
safety regulations. By contrast, small 
businesses often struggle to absorb the 
costs of government paperwork because 
of their more limited staff and budgets. 
The smallest firms—those with fewer 
than 20 employees—spend 45 percent 
more per employee than larger firms 
just to comply with federal regulations.25
Recognizing the burden of regu-
lation on small businesses, Congress 
sometimes exempts the smallest com-
panies from certain regulations. For 
example, small businesses with 49 or 
fewer employees are exempt from the 
Family and Medical Leave Act, which 
gives employees up to 12 weeks of 
unpaid leave each year to take care of 
a newborn child, adopt a child, or care 
for a family member who has serious 
health problems.26 Most small-business 
owners comply with employment and 
other laws, believing that such compli-
ance is ethically correct and fosters 
better employee relations than trying 
to determine which regulations don’t 
apply to a small business.
Taxes are another burdensome 
expense for a small business. In addition 
to local, state, and federal income taxes, 
employers must pay taxes covering workers’ compensation insurance, Social Security pay-
ments, and unemployment benefits. Although large companies have similar expenses, they 
generally have more resources to cover them. But there are also tax incentives designed to 
help small businesses. These incentives cover a broad range including tax credits for use of 
biodiesel and renewable fuels, increased research activities, pension plan start-up, and access 
for individuals with disabilities.27
The Business Plan: 
A Foundation for Success
Large or small, every business needs a plan in order to succeed. While there are tales of 
firms launched from an idea scribbled on a napkin at a restaurant or sketched out on graph 
paper in a dorm room, the idea must be backed by a solid plan in order to become reality.

goals, the methods by which it intends to 
achieve these goals, and the standards by 
which it will measure its achievements. The 
business plan is often the document that 
secures financing for a firm and creates a 
framework for the organization.
Business plans give the organization a 
sense of purpose. They identify the firm’s 
mission and goals. They create measurable 
standards and outline a strategy for reaching 
company objectives. A typical business plan 
includes the following sections:
 
•  an executive summary that briefly answers 
the who, what, where, when, why, and how 
questions for the business
 •  an introduction that includes a general state-
ment of the concept, purpose, and objec-
tives of the proposed business
 • separate financial and marketing sections
 
that describe the firm’s target market and 
marketing plan as well as detailed financial forecasts of the need for funds and when the 
firm is expected to break even—the level of sales at which revenues equal costs
 • résumés of principals—especially in plans written to obtain financing.
Within this structure, an effective business plan contains the written soul of a firm. 
A good plan addresses the following issues:
 • The company’s mission and the vision of its founders. Look at the home page of any firm’s 
Web site and you will find its mission. At the Web site for TOMs Shoes, visitors 
learn that “TOMs shoes was founded on a simple premise: With every pair you purchase, 
TOMs will give a pair of new shoes to a child in need. One for one. Using the purchasing 
power of individuals to benefit the greater good is what we’re all about.”28 This simple 
declaration states why the company was founded and what it intends to accomplish.
 • An outline of what makes the company unique. Why start a business that’s just like hundreds 
of others? An effective business plan describes what distinguishes the firm and its prod-
ucts from the rest of the pack. TOMs Shoes illustrates a unique business model with its 
“one-for-one” donation program.
 • The customers. A business plan identifies who the firm’s customers will be and how it will 
serve their needs.
 • The competition. A business plan addresses its existing and potential competitors as legitimate 
entities, with a strategy for creating superior or unique offerings. Studying the competition 
can provide valuable information about what works and what doesn’t in the marketplace.
 • Financial evaluation of the industry and market conditions. This knowledge helps develop a 
credible financial forecast and budget.
 • Assessment of the risks. Every business undertaking involves risks. A solid business plan 
acknowledges these and outlines a strategy for dealing with them.29

Whether a firm’s intention is to revolutionize an entire industry on a global scale or 
improve the lives of children by providing them with shoes, the business plan is a major 
factor in its success. For more detailed information on how to write a business plan, see 
Appendix D, “Developing a Business Plan,” on page A-43.
Assistance for Small Businesses
An important part of organizing a small business is financing its activities. Once a busi-
ness plan has been created, various sources can be tapped for loans and other types of financ-
ing. These include government agencies as well as private investors. In the scramble for 
dollars, sometimes government allocation of funds to certain firms is subject to criticism, as 
discussed in the “Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature.
Small Business Administration
Small businesses can benefit from using the resources provided by the Small Business 
Administration (SBA). The SBA is the principal government agency concerned with help-
ing small U.S. firms, and it is the advocate for small businesses within the federal govern-
ment. More than 2,100 employees staff the SBA’s Washington headquarters and its regional 
and field offices.30 The SBA is “committed to helping small businesses, which are the back-
bone of the nation’s economy, thrive. Working closely with a wide range of lending partners 
across the country, SBA has developed a number of financial programs that address the vari-
ous needs of small businesses.”31

Fisker Automotive received government loans to build a plug-in hybrid sports car called the Karma. That sounds 
like a win–win situation—investment in alternative energy vehicles, creation of new jobs, rejuvenation of the auto 
industry—but the new car will be built in Finland and priced around $89,000, out of reach for the average car 
buyer.

Financial Assistance from the SBA Contrary to popular belief, the SBA 
seldom provides direct business loans. Nor does it provide outright grants to start or expand 
small businesses.32 Instead, the SBA guarantees small-business loans made by private lenders, 
including banks and other institutions. To qualify for an SBA-backed loan, borrowers must 
be “unable to secure conventional commercial financing on reasonable terms and be a ‘small 
business’ as defined by SBA size standards.”33 Direct SBA loans are available in only a few 
special situations, such as natural disaster recovery and energy conservation or development 
programs. Under the 2009 Recovery Act, the SBA temporarily eliminated specific loan fees 
and raised the guarantee level on some of its loans.34
The SBA also guarantees microloans of up to $35,000 to start-ups and other very small 
firms. The average loan is $13,000 with a maximum term of six years.35 Microloans may be 
used to buy equipment or operate a business but not to buy real estate or pay off other loans. 
These loans are available from nonprofit organizations located in most states. Other sources 
 
During the recent economic downturn, many businesses—large 
and small—received funds from the federal government to survive and 
ultimately grow. One such business was Fisker Automotive, a California 
start-up automaker that received $528 million in government loans to 
build a plug–in hybrid sports car called the Karma. That sounds like 
a win-win situation for everyone—investment in vehicles powered by 
alternative energy, the creation of new jobs, rejuvenation of the auto 
industry. But the allocation has its critics, largely because the new car 
will be built in Finland—and will be priced at about $89,000, out of 
reach for the average car buyer.
Should federal funds be allocated to support fi rms 
that manufacture luxury goods overseas?
Summary
Fisker has pledged to repay the government loans with interest and to offer a superior product to lux-
ury car buyers. The firm claims that the launch of the Karma, the world’s first production plug-in hybrid car, 
will “put the American auto industry ahead of foreign competition.” But detractors say that federal funds 
should be reserved for firms that produce goods and services to benefit a wider range of consumers.

PRO
1. According to Fisker Automotive, no federal funds will be used 
for operations overseas. Instead, much of the loan money will be used 
for the purchase of components from U.S. suppliers, as well as engi-
neering and design, which will be done in the U.S. The Department of 
Energy estimates that the loans will save or create about 5,000 jobs.
2. Although the Karma carries a hefty sticker price, the design of 
the car should attract buyers who might otherwise purchase traditional 
sports cars whose fuel consumption and emissions are high. Fisker 
claims that with projected tax credits, the Karma will ultimately cost 
around $39,000.
CON
1. Investing in a product that can only be purchased by the 
wealthiest car buyers is not an equitable distribution of government 
funds. “This is not for average Americans,” argues a spokesperson for 
Citizens Against Government Waste. “It’s a status symbol thing.”
2. Other firms, including those that applied for much smaller 
loans to develop alternatively powered vehicles at a lower price point, 
were rejected by the government. More companies could have been 
supported, with more jobs created, and more hybrid cars could have 
been sold to average car buyers if the funds had been distributed more 
equitably.

of microloans include the federal Economic Development Administration, some state gov-
ernments, and certain private lenders, such as credit unions and community development 
groups. The most frequent suppliers of credit to small firms are banks.
Small-business loans are also available through SBA-licensed organizations called Small 
Business Investment Companies (SBICs), which are run by experienced venture capitalists. 
SBICs use their own capital, supplemented with government loans, to invest in small busi-
nesses. Like banks, SBICs are profit-making enterprises, but they are likely to be more flex-
ible than banks in their lending decisions. Large companies that used SBIC financing when 
they were small start-ups include Apple, Federal Express, and Staples.
Other Specialized Assistance Although government purchases represent a 
huge market, small companies have difficulty competing for this business with giant firms, 
which employ specialists to handle the volumes of paperwork involved in preparing propos-
als and completing bid applications. Today, many government procurement programs set 
aside portions of government spending for small companies; an additional SBA role is to 
help small firms secure these contracts. With set-aside programs for small businesses, up to 
23 percent of certain government contracts are designated for small businesses.
Every federal agency with buying authority must maintain an Office of Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization to ensure that small businesses receive a reasonable por-
tion of government procurement contracts. To help connect small businesses with govern-
ment agencies, the SBA’s Web site offers Central Contractor Registration, which includes 
a search engine for finding business opportunities as well as a chance for small businesses to 
provide information about themselves. Set-aside programs are also common in the private 
sector, particularly among major corporations.
In addition to help with financing and government procurement, the SBA delivers a 
variety of other services to small businesses. It provides information and advice through toll-
free telephone numbers and its Web site, http://www.sba.gov. Through its Small Business 
Training Network, the SBA offers free online courses; sponsors inexpensive training courses 
on topics such as taxes, networking, and start-ups in cities and small towns throughout the 
nation; and provides a free online library of more than 200 SBA publications and additional 
business resources. Business owners can find local resources by logging on to the SBA Web 
site and searching for SBA partners in their region. Local resource partners include small-
business development centers, women’s business centers, U.S. export assistance centers, and 
veterans business outreach centers.36
Local Assistance for Small Businesses
In conjunction with the federal government or on their own, state and local govern-
ments often have programs in place to help small businesses get established and grow. 
One such region is Washington state’s Thurston County. The Thurston County Economic 
Development Council was founded more than 25 years ago with the mission of “creating 
a vital and sustainable economy throughout our County that supports the livelihood and 
values of our residents.”37 The Thurston County EDC provides information and assistance 
in business planning, licenses and registrations, taxes, and employment considerations. In 
addition, the council works to connect local businesses with each other and with industry 
experts, create marketing messages that attract new businesses and customers, and ensure 
that Thurston County plays an important role in the region’s economy.38 Organizations 
like the Thurston County EDC offer important resources and links for small businesses 
around the country.

Business Incubators Some community agencies interested in encouraging busi-
ness development have implemented a concept called a business incubator to provide low-
cost shared business facilities to small start-up ventures. See the “Hit and Miss” feature to 
read about Turning Technologies’ incubator experience. A typical incubator might section 
off space in an abandoned plant and rent it to various small firms. Tenants often share cleri-
cal staff, computers, and other business services. The objective is that, after a few months or 
years, the fledgling business will be ready to move out and operate on its own.
More than 1,000 business incubator programs operate nationwide. Ninety-four percent 
of them are run by not-for-profit organizations focused on economic development. More 
than half of these programs are operated in urban areas, while about 20 percent of them are 
sponsored by academic institutions.39
Private Investors
A small business may start with cash from a personal savings account or a loan from a 
family member. But small-business owners soon begin to look for greater sums of money 
in order to continue operating and eventually grow. They may want to continue with assis-
tance from private investors. Venture capital—money invested in the small business by 
another business firm or group of individuals in exchange for an ownership share—can give 
the small business a boost. Even when the economy is sluggish, venture capitalists are look-
ing for companies in which to invest. Recently the National Venture Capital Association 
reported that venture capitalists had invested more than $7 billion in small start-up firms 
despite a sluggish economy. These investors showed preference for small-business owners 
with a proven track record and for those proposing innovative ways to com-
mercialize products like solar energy, low-emission cars, and new medications. 
They’re tough in their requirements for a solid business plan and expect small-
businesses owners to run lean operations.40
Small-Business Opportunities for Women 
and Minorities
In the United States today, more than 10 million firms are owned by 
women, employing more than 13 million workers and generating nearly $2 
trillion in sales. In fact, 40 percent of all privately held companies are owned 
by women. Further, nearly 2 million businesses are owned by women of color, 
employing 1.2 million people and generating $165 billion in annual revenues.41
Women, like men, have a variety of reasons for starting their own compa-
nies. Some have a unique business idea that they want to bring to life. Others 
decide to strike out on their own when they lose their jobs or become frus-
trated with the bureaucracies in large companies. When Shama Kabani wrote 
her master’s thesis on the power of social networking, her research suggested 
that businesses could use these tools to market their goods and services. But 
when she pitched her idea to a large consulting firm, the company rejected it 
as a fad. So Kabani set out on her own. She founded her own full-time online 
consulting firm called Click to Client (now called The Marketing Zen Group), 
to build Web sites and create and manage social media campaigns for clients. 
Kabani now has six employees and expects to hit $1 million in annual 
revenues soon.42

In other cases, women leave large corporations when they feel blocked from opportu-
nities for advancement. Sometimes this occurs because they hit the so-called glass ceiling. 
Because women are more likely than men to be the primary caregivers in their families, 
some may seek self-employment as a way to achieve flexible working hours so they can spend 
more time with their families.
Many nationwide business assistance programs are geared toward women-owned firms. 
Among the programs offered by the Small Business Administration are the Contract Assistance 
for Women Business Owners program, which teaches women how to market to the federal 
government, and the Women’s Network for Entrepreneurial Training, which matches expe-
rienced businesswomen with women trying to get started. Organizations like the Center for 
Women’s Business Research provide information, contacts, and other resources as well.
Young companies that grow and add jobs to boost their local 
economies make a lot of people happy about their success. That’s why 
so many people are smiling in Youngstown, Ohio, since a new technol-
ogy company came to town.
Helped along by a business organization that provides start-
up tech firms with free rent and utilities, Turning Technologies was 
founded in Youngstown. Its breathtaking growth brought dozens of 
new jobs to a city with 18 percent unemployment that is haunted 
by the decline of its old steel mills. Turning pays corporate income 
taxes on more than $30 million annual revenue, and it has already 
been called the fastest growing privately held software company in 
the United States—ranked at 18th overall. The firm boasts more 
than 6,500 clients, and more than a million people use its audience-
response products.
Audience-response systems are the wireless keypads you’ve proba-
bly seen spectators using on TV game shows to register their opinions or 
answers to questions. Thanks to Turning’s affordable hardware and the 
availability of both its free and licensed software programs, teachers from 
kindergarten through college are now enjoying the benefits of audience-
response technology. Instructors can ask questions in class using other 
programs like PowerPoint, Blackboard, and WebCT; have students key in 
answers—anonymously or not—using their remotes; and instantly col-
late the responses to see how many students answered correctly.
Government agencies and not-for-profit organizations also use 
the systems for their training programs. “Audience involvement boosts 
focus and comprehension levels,” says Turning’s CEO Mike Broderick, 
and instructors agree. “It gives you the opportunity to reteach if you 
need to and then move on if you don’t,” says one middle school 
teacher. Adds a school principal about applications of the Turning 
program, “We have some teachers that are working hard to find the 
many avenues they can go beyond. You’re really only limited by your 
creativity.”
And it gets better. “Not only can we identify how each student is 
responding,” says Turning’s vice president for education sales, but “we 
can compile that data by classroom, by building, and by district and tag 
the data to specific standards.” Among the impressive results already 
confirmed is “an increase of 15 points in test scores when our technol-
ogy is used frequently and effectively.”
Most of Turning’s 120 employees are young Ohioans who enjoy 
some of the same benefits as their Silicon Valley counterparts, such as 
in-house foosball and air hockey for work breaks. The firm takes pride 
in being the kind of success story people have long thought “doesn’t 
happen here.” It has had double- or triple-digit growth since its launch. 
“I would not be surprised to see Turning Technologies at 2,000 work-
ers in three to four years,” says the CEO of the organization that 
helped the company get its start.
That’s music to Youngstown’s ears. The bottom line? Good prod-
ucts that are affordable, easy to use, and well marketed can help small 
companies become engines of growth and job creators.

Business ownership is also an important opportunity for America’s racial and eth-
nic minorities. In recent years, the growth in the number of businesses owned by African 
Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans has far outpaced the growth in the number of 
U.S. businesses overall. Figure 5.4 shows the percentages of minority ownership in major 
industries. The relatively strong presence of minorities in the services and retail industries is 
especially significant because these industries contain the greatest number of businesses.
The Small Business Administration has programs targeted to minority-owned small 
businesses. One is the Mentor-Protégé Program, which pairs an established, financially 
healthy business with a small minority-owned business. Through the program, the protégé 
firm gains technical and financial assistance as well as subcontract support.43
Franchising
Franchising combines large and small businesses into a single entity, and is a major fac-
tor in the growth of small businesses. Franchising is a contractual business arrangement 
between a manufacturer or another supplier and a dealer such as a restaurant operator or a 
retailer. The contract specifies the methods by which the dealer markets the product of the 
supplier. Franchises can involve both goods and services, such as food and wait staff. The top 
ten franchises are shown in Table 5.3.
Starting a small, independent company can be a risky, time-consuming endeavor, but 
franchising can reduce the amount of time and effort needed to expand. The parent com-
pany has already developed and tested the concept, and the brand is often familiar to pro-
spective customers.

The Franchising Sector
Franchised businesses are a huge 
part of the U.S. economy, accounting 
for nearly 50 percent of all retail sales. 
The International Franchise Association 
reported that franchising is responsible 
for 760,000 businesses, 18 million jobs, 
and more than $500 billion in payroll. 
Total sales by franchises continue to grow 
and approach $2 trillion. A new franchise 
is opened every eight minutes every 
business day.44
Franchising overseas is also a grow-
ing trend for businesses whose goal is to 
expand into foreign markets. It seems that 
anywhere you go in the world, you can 
get a McDonald’s burger. But other inter-
national franchises are becoming more 
common. Baskin-Robbins, now owned by 
Dunkin’ Brands, has more than 6,000 stores in more than 35 countries including Australia, 
Canada, China, Japan, Malaysia, and Russia. In Japan alone, there are more than 850 Baskin-
Robbins ice cream stores. Baskin-Robbins holds the 13th rank of top U.S.-based franchises.45
Franchising Agreements
The two principals in a franchising agreement are the franchisee and the franchisor. 
The individual or business firm purchasing the franchise is called the franchisee. This busi-
ness owner agrees to sell the goods or services of the franchisor under certain terms. The 
franchisor is the firm whose products are sold by the franchisee. For example, McDonald’s 
Corp. is a franchisor. Your local McDonald’s restaurant owner is a franchisee.
Franchise agreements can be complex. They involve an initial purchase fee plus agreed-
upon start-up costs. Because the franchisee is representing the franchisor’s brand, the 
franchisor usually stipulates the purchase of certain ingredients or equipment, pricing, and 
marketing efforts. McDonald’s is one of the more expensive franchises—total start-up costs

can run more than $1 million. In contrast, the total start-up cost for a SUBWAY franchise 
may reach $228,000.46 For this reason, businesspeople interested in purchasing a more 
expensive franchise often group together.
Benefits and Problems of Franchising
As with any other type of business arrangement, franchising has its benefits and draw-
backs. Benefits for the franchisor include opportunities for expansion that might not other-
wise be available. A franchised business can move into new geographic locations, including 
those overseas, at less expense and with the advantages of employing local workers and 
businesspeople who have intimate knowledge of consumer preferences. A good franchisor 
can manage a much larger and more complex business—with fewer direct employees—than 
could be handled without the franchise option. In most cases, franchisees will be highly 
attentive to the management of their franchises because of their stake as business owners. 
If the business is run efficiently, the franchisor will probably experience a greater return on 
investment than if the firm were run entirely as a company-owned chain of retail shops, res-
taurants, or service establishments.
Finally, a successful franchisor can usually negotiate better deals on ingredients, supplies, 
even real estate, because of its financial strength. This clout also benefits the franchisees if 
the savings are passed along to them.47
Franchising can be the quickest way to become a business owner. Some people contend 
that it’s also the least risky. Franchisees have the benefit of name recognition—McDonald’s, 
SUBWAY, Pizza Hut, and Super 8—that usually includes a loyal following of customers. 
The management system of the franchisor has already been established and a performance 
record is readily available. In addition, franchisors provide a wide range of support to fran-
chisees, including financing, assistance in obtaining a location, business training, supplies, 
and marketing tools.48
Franchisees themselves say they are drawn to the idea of franchising because it com-
bines the freedom of business ownership with the support of a large company. Like other 
small-business owners, franchisees want to make their own business decisions and determine 
their own work hours. And they want to have more control over the amount of wealth they 
can possibly accumulate, as opposed to what they might earn in a salaried job. In an eco-
nomic slowdown, franchisees might very well be executives who have been laid off during 
a downsizing or reorganization effort by previous employers. These are highly trained and 
motivated businesspeople looking for a way to restart their careers.49 Sometimes the ideas 
or successes of individual franchisees can benefit the entire company, as was the case with 
SUBWAY, described in the “Hit & Miss” feature.
Franchising can have its downside—for both franchisors and franchisees. For the fran-
chisor, if its franchisees fail in any way, that failure reflects on the brand as well as the bot-
tom line. The same holds true for the franchisee: a firm that is mismanaged at the top level 
can spell doom for the smaller business owners who are actually running the individual units. 
Krispy Kreme, mentioned earlier, is an example of a franchised company that stumbled due 
to overexpansion. When a firm initially decides to offer franchise opportunities, the com-
pany overall may lose money for several years. Of course, in offering franchise opportunities, 
the franchisor—often the founder of what was once a small business—loses absolute control 
over every aspect of the business. This uncertainty can make the process of selecting the 
right franchisees to carry out the company’s mission a difficult one.50

SUBWAY has enjoyed top franchise rankings consistently for 
more than a decade. With 30,000 sandwich restaurants in nearly 80 
countries, the firm is poised to become the single largest fast-food 
chain in the world. But SUBWAY is made up of many small busi-
nesses—franchises—and sometimes what seems to be an insignifi-
cant idea on the part of one franchisee can change the shape of the 
entire organization.
Stuart Frankel is one such franchisee, and his idea was simple: on 
weekends, charge a special price of $5 for a footlong SUBWAY sand-
wich. Since this was a price decrease of about $1 per sandwich, it took 
awhile for Frankel and two other local Florida SUBWAY franchisees 
to convince corporate leadership that the idea was a good one. The 
economy was sluggish, food costs had crept upward, and SUBWAY 
shops were virtually empty because consumers were eating at home 
instead of dining out. Frankel’s employees stood idle at their stations 
as sandwich sales declined. But after pressing hard, Frankel got the OK 
from corporate headquarters. From there, a chain reaction began.
“I like round numbers,” quipped Frankel about the $5 price. 
SUBWAY customers liked the number too. As soon as the special pric-
ing was announced, they returned in droves. Sales increased by double 
digits. Employees made sandwiches as fast as their fingers could fly. 
Meanwhile, SUBWAY’s corporate marketing team pushed the $5 pro-
motion nationwide—franchises from New York to New Orleans began 
offering $5 footlongs. When the initial four-week time span for the 
promotion was up, marketing executives extended it to seven weeks. 
When that time lapsed, they decided to extend it indefinitely but with a 
limited number of sandwich variations.
Something else happened. Demand for the $5 footlongs was so 
great that franchise owners began to experience shortages of certain 
ingredients. They couldn’t get enough bread, turkey, ham, or tuna. One 
franchisee recalls being in a panic. “The whole thing took on a life of 
its own,” notes Jeff Moody, CEO of SUBWAY’s advertising arm.
With one motion, Stuart Frankel struck a chord with consumers 
who were looking for ways to enjoy themselves and stretch each dollar 
at the same time. “There are only a few times when a chain has been 
able to scramble up the whole industry, and this is one of them,” notes 
restaurant consultant Jeffrey T. Davis. “It’s huge.” Sometimes a small 
idea is really big.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Why do you think Stuart Frankel’s idea was so successful 
with consumers? Would it have been as successful during 
different economic circumstances? Why or why not?
2. A franchise company is only as good as its franchisees. 
And a franchisee’s success is based in part on the decisions 
and support of corporate leadership. If the $5 footlong 
promotion had failed, how do you think the outcome 
would have affected Frankel’s franchise business? How 
might it have affected SUBWAY?

One Small Franchise Produces One Big Idea
Hit 
The franchisee faces an outlay of cash in the form of an initial investment, franchise 
fees, supplies, maintenance, leases, and the like. The most expensive franchises generally 
are those that involve hotels and resorts, which can run in the millions.51 Start-up costs for 
McDonald’s restaurants can also top several million, depending on the location. For this 
reason, it is not unusual for groups of businesspeople to purchase a franchise (or several fran-
chise locations).52 Payments to the franchisor can add to the burden of keeping the business 
afloat until the owner begins to earn a profit. Choosing a low-cost start up such as Guard-a-
Kid may be a good alternative option. Guard-a-Kid is the largest child-identity franchise in 
the nation. It offers franchisees a complete start-up kit, including two days of training and 
supplies ranging from a laptop computer and digital camera to logo T-shirts and personal-
ized business cards for a fee of $10,000 to $20,000 depending on territory size.53 But it’s 
important for potential franchisees to evaluate carefully how much profit they can make once 
their cost obligations are met.
Because franchises are so closely linked to their brand, franchisors and franchisees must 
work well together to maintain standards of quality in their goods and services. If customers 
are unhappy with their experience at one franchise location, they might avoid stopping at 
another one several miles away, even if the second one is owned and operated by someone

else. This is especially true where food is involved. The discovery of tainted meat or produce 
at one franchise restaurant can cause panic to spread throughout the entire chain. A potential 
franchisee would be wise to thoroughly research the financial performance and reputation of 
the franchisor, using resources such as other franchisees, the Better Business Bureau, and the 
Federal Trade Commission.
Some franchisees have found the franchising agreement to be too confining. As the say-
ing goes, you can’t add a tuna salad sandwich to the menu at McDonald’s no matter how 
many stores you own. The agreements are usually fairly strict, and that generally helps to 
maintain the integrity of the brand. Toward this end, some franchise companies control 
promotional activities, select the site location, or even become involved in hiring decisions. 
But these activities may seem overly restrictive to some franchisees, especially those seeking 
independence and autonomy.
Restrictions can also cost franchisees more than they feel is fair. Recently, the National 
Franchise Association, a group that represents more than 80 percent of Burger King’s U.S. 
franchisees, sued the hamburger company for forcing its members to offer consumers a $1 
double cheeseburger on its menu, complying with the company’s promotional efforts. While 
the $1 burger offering may seem like a great way to attract and serve hungry consumers, BK 
franchisees claim that the promotion has cost them a loss of at least 10 cents per burger. In 
other words, it costs most franchises $1.10 to make and serve a cheeseburger for which they 
must charge $1.54
Forms of Private 
Business Ownership
Regardless of its size, every business is organized according to one of three categories 
of legal structure: sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. As Figure 5.5 shows, sole 
proprietorships are the most common form of business ownership, accounting for more than 
70 percent of all firms in the United States. Although far fewer firms are organized as cor-
porations, the revenues earned by these companies are 19 times greater than those earned by 
sole proprietorships.
Each legal structure offers unique advantages and disadvantages. But because there is no 
universal formula for every situation, some business owners prefer to organize their compa-
nies further as S corporations, limited-liability partnerships, and limited-liability companies. 
In some cases, corporations are owned by their employees.
In addition to the three main legal structures, several other options for ownership exist. 
These include employee-owned businesses, family-owned businesses and not-for-profit 
organizations.
Sole Proprietorships
The most common form of business ownership, the sole proprietorship is also the 
oldest and the simplest. In a sole proprietorship, no legal distinction separates the sole 
proprietor’s status as an individual from his or her status as a business owner. Although 
sole proprietorships are common in a variety of industries, they are concentrated primarily 
among small  businesses such as repair shops, small retail stores, and service providers such as 
plumbers, hair stylists, and photographers.

Sole proprietorships offer some unique advantages. Because such busi-
nesses involve a single owner, they are easy to form and dissolve. A sole 
proprietorship gives the owner maximum management flexibility, along 
with the right to all profits after payment of business-related bills and 
taxes. A highly motivated owner of a sole proprietorship directly reaps the 
benefits of his or her hard work.
Minimal legal requirements simplify entering and exiting a sole pro-
prietorship. The owner registers the business or trade name—to guarantee 
that two firms do not use the same name—and takes out any necessary 
licenses. Local governments require certain licenses for businesses such as 
restaurants, motels or hotels, and retail stores. In addition, some occupa-
tional licenses require business owners to obtain specific insurance such as 
liability coverage.
Sole proprietorships are also easy to dissolve. This advantage is par-
ticularly important to temporary or seasonal businesses that set up for a 
limited period of time. It’s also helpful if the owner needs or wants to close 
the business for any reason—say, to relocate or to accept a full-time posi-
tion with a larger firm.
Management flexibility is another advantage of a sole proprietorship. 
The owner can make decisions without reporting to a manager, take quick 
action, and keep trade secrets. A sole proprietorship always bears the individual “stamp” 
or flair of its owner, whether it’s a certain way of styling hair or the way a store window is 
decorated.
The greatest disadvantage of the sole proprietorship is the owner’s personal financial 
liability for all debts of the business. Also, the business must operate with financial resources 
limited to the owner’s personal funds and money that he or she can borrow. Such financing 
limitations can keep the business from expanding.
Another disadvantage is that the owner must wear many hats, handling a wide range 
of management and operational responsibilities. He or she may not have expertise in every 
area, which may inhibit the firm’s growth or even cause the firm damage. In addition, sole 
proprietors may face a higher chance of being audited by the Internal Revenue Service than 
other types of business owners. Finally, a sole proprietorship usually lacks long-term conti-
nuity, because a change in personal circumstances or finances can terminate the business on 
short notice.
Partnerships
Another option for organizing a business is to form a partnership. The Uniform 
Partnership Act, which regulates this ownership form in most states, defines a partnership 
as an association of two or more persons who operate a business as co-owners by voluntary 
legal agreement. Many small businesses begin as partnerships between co-founders.
Partnerships are easy to form. All the partners need to do is register the business name 
and obtain any necessary licenses. Having a partner generally means greater financial capa-
bility and someone to share in the tasks and decision making of a business. It’s even better if 
one partner has a particular skill such as design, while the other has a knack for financials.
Most partnerships have the disadvantage of being exposed to unlimited financial liabil-
ity. Each partner bears full responsibility for the debts of the firm, and each is legally liable

for the actions of the other partners. If the firm fails and is left with debt—no matter who is 
at fault—every partner is responsible for those debts. If one partner defaults, the others are 
responsible for the firm’s debts, even if it means dipping into personal funds. To avoid these 
problems, many firms establish a limited-liability partnership, which limits the liability of 
partners to the value of their interests in the company.
Breaking up a partnership is more complicated than dissolving a sole proprietorship. 
Rather than simply withdrawing funds from the bank, the partner who wants out may need 
to find someone to buy his or her interest in the firm. The death of a partner also threat-
ens the survival of a partnership. A new partnership must be formed, and the estate of the 
deceased is entitled to a share of the firm’s value. To ease the financial strains of such events, 
business planners recommend life insurance coverage for each partner, combined with a buy-
sell agreement. The insurance proceeds can be used to repay the deceased partner’s heirs and 
allow the surviving partner to retain control of the business. Because partnerships are vulner-
able to personal conflicts that can quickly escalate, it’s important for partners to choose each 
other carefully—not just because they are best friends—and try to plan for the future.
Corporations
A corporation is a legal organization with assets and liabilities separate from those of 
its owner(s). A corporation can be a large or small business. It can be Ford Motor Corp. or a 
local auto repair shop.
Corporate ownership offers considerable advantages. Because a corporation is a separate 
legal entity, its stockholders have only limited financial risk. If the firm fails, they lose only 
the money they have invested. This applies to the firm’s managers and executives as well. 
Because they are not the sole proprietors or partners in the business, their personal savings 
are not at risk if the company folds or goes bankrupt. This protection also extends to legal 
risk. Class-action suits involving automakers, drug manufacturers, and food producers are 
filed against the companies, not the owners of those companies. Though companies such as 
T-Mobile and GE recently experienced class-action suits, their employees and stockholders 
were not required to pay the settlements from their own bank accounts.55
Corporations offer other advantages. They gain access to expanded financial capabili-
ties based on the opportunity to offer direct outside investments such as stock sales. A large 
corporation can legally generate internal financing for many projects by transferring money 
from one part of the corporation to another.
One major disadvantage for a corporation is the double taxation of corporate earn-
ings. After a corporation pays federal, state, and local income taxes on its profits, its owners 
(stockholders) also pay personal taxes on any distributions of those profits they receive from 
the corporation in the form of dividends.
S Corporations and Limited Liability Corporations To avoid double 
taxation of business income while minimizing financial liability for their owners, many 
smaller firms (those with fewer than 100 stockholders) organize as S corporations. These 
companies can elect to pay federal income taxes as partnerships while retaining the liability 
limitations typical of corporations. S corporations are only taxed once. Unlike regular cor-
porations, S corporations do not pay corporate taxes on their profits. Instead, the untaxed 
profits of S corporations are paid directly as dividends to shareholders, who then pay the 
individual tax rate. This tax advantage has resulted in a tremendous increase in the number 
of S corporations. Consequently, the IRS is closely auditing S corporations because some 
businesses don’t meet the legal requirements to form S corporations.56

Business owners may also form limited-liability companies (LLCs) to secure the 
corporate advantage of limited liability while avoiding the double taxation characteristic of 
corporations. An LLC combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole propri-
etorship with the limited liability of a corporation.
An LLC is governed by an operating agreement that resembles a partnership agree-
ment, except that it reduces each partner’s liability for the actions of the other owners. 
Corporations of professionals, such as lawyers, accountants, and physicians, use a similar 
approach, with the letters PC attached to the business name. LLCs appear to be the wave of 
the future. Immediately after the first LLC law was passed, most major CPA (certified public 
accountant) firms in the U.S. converted to LLC status. Today you’ll see the LLC or PC des-
ignation attached to small businesses ranging from bowling alleys to veterinary hospitals. On 
a much larger scale, Amazon.com is also an LLC.
Employee-Owned Corporations
Another alternative for creating a corporation is employee ownership, in which work-
ers buy shares of stock in the company that employs them. The corporate organization stays 
the same, but most stockholders are also employees.
The popularity of this form of corporation is growing. The number of employee owner-
ship plans has increased dramatically. Today about 20 percent of all employees of for-profit 
companies report owning stock in their companies; approximately 25 million Americans own 
employer stock through employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), options, stock purchase plans, 
401(k) plans, and other plans.
Several trends underlie the rise in employee ownership. One is that employees want 
to share in whatever profit their company earns. Another is that company executives want 
employees to care deeply about their firm’s success and contribute their best effort. These 
firms remain committed to this kind of involvement and compensation for their workers. 
Because human resources are so essential to the success of a modern business, employers 
want to build their employees’ commitment to the organization. However, managers also 
admit that often employees below the executive level are not as informed about the pro-
grams as they should be, and their companies could do a better job of educating employees 
at all levels.57 Some of the country’s most successful public corporations, including Procter & 
Gamble, Lowe’s, and Southwest Airlines, have embraced employee ownership and watched 
their stock values hold up better than other companies.
Family-Owned Businesses
Family-owned firms are considered by many to be the backbone of American business. 
The Waltons and the Fords are viewed as pioneers because each of these firms—Walmart 
and Ford Motor Corp.—was once a small, family-owned company. Family-owned firms 
come in a variety of sizes and legal structures. But because of the complex nature of family 
relationships, family-owned firms experience some unique challenges.
Whether a family-owned business is structured as a partnership, limited liability corpo-
ration, or traditional corporation, its members must make decisions regarding succession, 
marriages and divorces, compensation, hierarchy and authority, shareholder control, and the 
like. Whereas some family members may prefer a loose structure—perhaps not even putting 
certain agreements in writing—experienced businesspeople caution that failing to choose 
the right legal structure for a family-owned firm can doom the business from the start.

“For family-owned businesses, especially those 
with multi-generational owners, lack of a formal 
structure is a frequent cause of turmoil and legal 
disputes which often result in very contentious liti-
gation and, ultimately, the dissolution of the busi-
ness,” asserts one expert in family businesses.58
Succession is a major benefit—and drawback—
to family-owned firms. On the one hand, a clearly 
documented plan for succession from one genera-
tion to the next is a huge source of security for the 
firm’s continuity. But lack of legal planning, or 
situations in which succession is challenged, can 
cause chaos. In fact, only a small percentage of 
family-owned businesses survive into the second or 
even third generation.
A small family firm that has managed to thrive 
for five generations is Squamscott Beverages. 
Originally called Connermade, the company was 
founded in 1883 when William H. Conner began producing his own “tonic” beverage—a 
spruce beer that came in glass bottles with porcelain and wire stoppers. Conner ran the com-
pany until his son Alfred took over in 1911. Alfred remained in charge until 1948, when he 
handed the reins to his own son, Alfred Jr. Today, Tom Conner and his son Dan manage 
most aspects of running the firm, which is still headquartered on the family’s rural property. 
Squamscott Beverages produces soda drinks in a variety of flavors, including birch beer, 
cola, cream, orange, grape, and ginger ale. Bottles are distributed to small grocery outlets, or 
customers can visit the bottling plant to select whatever flavors they want. Recently the com-
pany sent its first shipment of soda to California and is considering further expanding its dis-
tribution. “We have made it through the Great Depression,” notes Dan Conner. “We made 
it through the early ’80s housing crunch. We’re always going to be here.”59 The Conners are 
not as famous or as wealthy as the Waltons or Fords, but the chance of their business surviv-
ing through future generations is strong.
Not-for-Profit Corporations
The same business concepts that apply to commercial companies also apply to not-for-
profit corporations—organizations whose goals do not include pursuing a profit. About 
1.5 million not-for-profits operate in the United States, including charitable groups, social-
welfare organizations, government agencies, and religious congregations. This sector also 
includes museums, libraries, hospitals, conservation groups, private schools, and the like.
Most states set out separate legal provisions for organizational structures and operations 
of not-for-profit corporations. These organizations do not issue stock certificates, because 
they pay no dividends to owners, and ownership rarely changes. They are also exempt from 
paying income taxes. However, they must meet very strict regulations in order to maintain 
their not-for-profit status.
City Year Inc. is a not-for-profit organization that supports community service efforts by 
young people in their late teens and early twenties. City Year has a number of programs in 
which volunteers can participate. Its signature program, the City Year Youth Corps, invites 
1,500 volunteers between the ages of 17 and 24 to commit to a year of full-time community

service in activities such as mentoring and tutoring inner-city school children, helping to 
restore and reclaim public spaces, and staffing youth summer camps. The organization also 
partners with for-profit corporations such as Timberland, Comcast, and Pepsi to fund and 
implement its efforts.60
Public and Collective 
Ownership of Business
Though most businesses in the U.S. are owned by the private sector, some firms are 
actually owned by local, state, or the federal government. Alaskan Railroad Corp., East 
Alabama Medical Center, and the Iowa Lottery are all government-owned businesses.61
In another type of ownership structure, groups of customers may collectively own a 
company. Recreational Equipment Inc. (REI) is a collectively owned retailer that sells out-
door gear and apparel. Finally, groups of smaller firms may collectively own a larger organi-
zation. Both of these collective ownership structures are also referred to as cooperatives.
Public (Government) Ownership
One alternative to private ownership is some form of public ownership, in which a unit 
or agency of government owns and operates an organization. In the United States, local 
governments often own parking structures and water systems. The Pennsylvania Turnpike 
Authority operates a vital highway link across the Keystone State. The federal government 
operates Hoover Dam in Nevada to provide electricity over a large region.
Sometimes public ownership results when private investors are unwilling to invest in a 
high-risk project—or find that operating an important service is simply unprofitable. The 
National Railroad Passenger Corporation—better known as Amtrak—is a for-profit corpora-
tion that operates inter-city passenger rail service in 46 states and the District of Columbia. 
Congress created Amtrak in the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, thereby removing from 
private railroads the obligation of transporting passengers, because passenger rail travel was 
generally unprofitable. In exchange, the private railroads granted Amtrak access to their 
existing tracks at a low cost. The Amtrak board of directors is made up of seven voting mem-
bers appointed for five-year terms by the President of the United States.62
Collective (Cooperative) Ownership
Collective ownership establishes an organization referred to as a cooperative (or co-op), 
whose owners join forces to operate all or part of the activities in their firm or industry. 
Currently, there are about 100 million people worldwide employed by cooperatives.63 
Cooperatives allow small businesses to pool their resources on purchases, marketing, equip-
ment, distribution, and the like. Discount savings can be split among members. Cooperatives 
can share equipment and expertise. During difficult economic times, members find a variety 
of ways to support each other.
Cooperatives are frequently found among agricultural businesses. Cabot Creamery is a 
cooperative of 1,500 small dairy farms spread throughout New England and upstate New 
York. Cabot is owned and operated by its members—farmers and their families. In addition, 
Cabot works with other cooperatives around the country to produce and distribute high-
quality cheese, butter, and other dairy products.64

Organizing a Corporation
A corporation is a legal structure, but it also requires a certain organizational structure 
that is more complex than the structure of a sole proprietorship or a partnership. This is why 
people often think of a corporation as a large entity, even though it does not have to be a 
specific size.
Types of Corporations
Corporations fall into three categories: domestic, foreign, and alien. A firm is considered 
a domestic corporation in the state where it is incorporated. When a company does business in 
states other than the one where it has filed incorporation papers, it is registered as a foreign 
corporation in each of those states. A firm incorporated in one nation that operates in another 
is known as an alien corporation where it operates. Some firms—particularly large corporations 
with operations scattered around the world—may operate under all three of these designations.
Where and How Businesses Incorporate
Businesses owners who want to incorporate must decide where to locate their headquar-
ters and follow the correct procedure for submitting the legal document that establishes the 
corporation.
Where to Incorporate Deciding where to incorporate—and establish headquar-
ters—may be based on a number of factors. Most businesses want to be near their customers. 
Real estate prices as well as services such as public transportation 
and communications networks are other variables. Access to a 
good labor pool is another reason for choosing a location. Online 
businesses such as Amazon.com and eBay don’t need to worry 
about positioning themselves near their customers, but they should 
consider the local labor pool.
Although most small- and medium-sized businesses are 
incorporated in the states in which they operate, a U.S. firm can 
actually incorporate in any state it chooses. The founders of large 
corporations, or of those that will do business nationwide, often 
compare the benefits—such as tax incentives—provided by each 
state. Some states are considered to be more “business friendly” 
than others. Delaware is one of the easiest states in which to 
incorporate.
The Corporate Charter Each state has a specific pro-
cedure for incorporating a business. Most states require at least 
three incorporators—the individuals who create the corporation. In 
addition, the new corporation must select a name that is different 
from names used by other businesses. Figure 5.6 lists the ten ele-
ments that most states require for chartering a corporation.
The information provided in the articles of incorporation 
forms the basis on which a state grants a corporate charter, which is

securing the charter, the owners prepare the company’s bylaws, which 
describe the rules and procedures for its operation.
Corporate Management
Regardless of its size, every corporation has levels of management 
and ownership. Figure 5.7 illustrates those that are typical—although 
a smaller firm might not contain all five of these. These levels range 
from stockholders down to supervisory management.
Stock Ownership and Stockholder Rights At 
the top of Figure 5.7 are stockholders. They buy shares of stock in 
the corporation, becoming part owners of it. Some companies, such 
as family businesses, are owned by relatively few stockholders, and the 
stock is generally unavailable to outsiders. In such a firm, known as a 
closed or closely held corporation, the stockholders also control and manage 
all of the company’s activities. S.C. Johnson & Son is one such firm.
In contrast, an open corporation, also called a publicly held corpo-
ration, sells stock to the general public, establishing diversified owner-
ship and often leading to a broader scope of operations than those of 
a closed corporation. Publicly held corporations usually hold annual 
stockholders’ meetings. During these meetings, managers report 
on corporate activities, and stockholders vote on any decisions that 
require their approval, including elections of officers. Walmart holds 
the nation’s largest stockholder meeting at the University of Arkansas 
Bud Walton Arena. Approximately 16,000 people attend. In addition 
to standard shareholder business, the Walmart meeting has featured 
celebrities and entertainers such as Tim McGraw, Mary J. Blige, and 
Jamie Foxx.
Stockholders’ role in the corporation depends on the class of stock 
they own. Shares are usually classified as common or preferred stock. 
Although owners of preferred stock have limited voting rights, they 
are entitled to receive dividends before holders of common stock. If the 
corporation is dissolved, they have first claims on assets, once debtors are repaid. Owners of 
common stock have voting rights but only residual claims on the firm’s assets, which means 
they are last to receive any income distributions. Because one share is typically worth only one 
vote, small stockholders generally have little influence on corporate management actions.
Board of Directors Stockholders elect a board of directors—the governing 
body of a corporation. The board sets overall policy, authorizes major transactions involv-
ing the corporation, and hires the chief executive officer (CEO). Most boards include both 
inside directors (corporate executives) and outside directors—people who are not otherwise 
employed by the organization. Sometimes the corporation’s top executive also chairs the 
board. Generally, outside directors are also stockholders, so they have a financial stake in the 
company’s performance.
Corporate Officers and Managers The CEO and other members of top 
management, such as the chief operating officer (COO), chief financial officer (CFO), and 
the chief information officer (CIO) make most major corporate decisions. Managers at the 
next level down the hierarchy, middle management, handle the ongoing operational

functions of the company. At the first tier of management, supervisory personnel coordinate 
day-to-day operations, assign specific tasks to employees, and evaluate job performance.
Today’s CEOs and CFOs are bound by stricter regulations than in the past. They must 
verify in writing the accuracy of their firm’s financial statements, and the process for nomi-
nating candidates for the board has become more complex. In short, more checks and bal-
ances are in place for the governance of corporations.
When Businesses Join Forces
Today’s business environment contains many complex relationships among businesses 
as well as not-for-profit organizations. Two firms may team up to develop a product or 
co-market products. One company may buy out another. Large corporations may split into 
smaller units. The list of alliances is a varied as the organizations themselves, but the major 
trends in corporate ownership include mergers and acquisitions and joint ventures.
Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)
In recent years, mergers and acquisitions among U.S. corporations have hit an all-time 
high. Airlines, financial institutions, telecommunications companies, and media corporations 
are just a few of the types of businesses that have merged into giants. Recently, Comcast 
announced its intention to buy a majority stake in NBC Universal from General Electric for 
$13.75 billion, which would give the nation’s largest cable company 51 percent control of 
the TV network as well as lucrative cable channels and a major movie studio.65
The terms merger and acquisition are often used interchangeably, but their meanings 
are different. In a merger, two or more firms combine to form one company. In an 
acquisition, one firm purchases the other. This means that not only does the buyer acquire 
the firm’s property and assets, it also takes on any debt obligations. Acquisitions also occur 
when one firm buys a division or subsidiary from another firm. HP acquired Compaq a 
number of years ago, letting the brand languish except in Asia, where it was always popular. 
But as U.S. consumers have recently become more focused on price, HP has made a move 
to revitalize its Compaq unit—offering a full-size Compaq laptop with all the bells and 
whistles, at a low price of $399. HP is now betting that its original investment in Compaq 
will pay off.66
Mergers can be classified as vertical, horizontal, or conglomerate. A vertical merger 
combines firms operating at different levels in the production and marketing process—the 
combination of a manufacturer and a large retailer, for instance. A vertical merger pursues 
one of two primary goals: (1) to ensure adequate flows of raw materials and supplies needed 
for a firm’s products or (2) to increase distribution. Software giant Microsoft is well known 
for acquiring small firms that have developed products with strong market potential, such as 
Teleo, a provider of voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) software and services that can be 
used to make phone calls via the Internet.
A horizontal merger joins firms in the same industry. This is done for the purpose of 
diversification, increasing customer bases, cutting costs, or expanding product lines. This 
type of merger is particularly popular in the auto industry. India-base Tata Motors bought 
the Jaguar and Land Rover brands from Ford Motor Corp. Volkswagen owns Audi and 
Porsche.

A conglomerate merger combines unrelated firms. The most common reasons for a 
conglomerate merger are to diversify, spur sales growth, or spend a cash surplus that might 
otherwise make the firm a tempting target for a takeover effort. Conglomerate mergers may 
join firms in totally unrelated industries. General Electric is, in fact, well known for its con-
glomerate mergers—including its ownership of healthcare services and household appliances. 
Experts debate whether conglomerate mergers are beneficial. The usual argument in favor 
of such mergers is that a company can use its management expertise to succeed in a variety 
of industries. But the obvious drawback is that a huge conglomerate can spread its resources 
too thin to be dominant in any one market.
Joint Ventures: Specialized Partnerships
A joint venture is a partnership between companies formed for a specific undertaking. 
Sometimes a company enters into a joint venture with a local firm, sharing the operation’s 
costs, risks, management, and profits with its local partner. This is particularly common 
when a firm wants to enter into business in a foreign market. A joint venture also may enable 
companies to solve a mutual problem.
Joint ventures between for-profit firms and not-for-profit organizations are becoming 
more and more common. These partnerships provide great benefits for both parties. Not-
for-profit organizations receive the funding, marketing exposure, and sometimes manpower 
they might not otherwise generate. City Year, mentioned earlier, enjoys these benefits from 
partnerships with Timberland, Pepsi, and Comcast along with other firms such as Starbucks 
and MSNBC. Recently, Starbucks partnered with MSNBC to publicize a program of com-
munity involvement called Brewing Together a Day of Service, in which Starbucks employ-
ees participated in shorter-term City Year projects.67
Joint ventures between not-for profits and for-profit firms often benefit the businesses 
as well. This is particularly true in the area of environmental conservation and sustain-
ability, where costs can be cut, energy saved, and waste reduced. In a partnership with the 
Environmental Defense Fund, McDonald’s has suc-
ceeded in phasing out toxic packaging; converting much 
of its cooking oil to biodiesel; eliminating more than 300 
million pounds of packaging; and reducing restaurant 
waste by more than 30 percent.68
What’s Ahead
The next chapter focuses on the driving forces 
behind the formation of new businesses: entrepreneurs. 
It examines the differences between a small-business 
owner and an entrepreneur and identifies certain per-
sonality traits typical of entrepreneurs. The chapter 
also details the process of launching a new venture, 
including identifying opportunities, locating needed 
financing, and turning good ideas into successful busi-
nesses. Finally, the chapter explores a method for 
infusing the entrepreneurial spirit into established 
businesses—intrapreneurship.

Summary of Learning Objectives
Distinguish between small and large businesses.
A small business is an independently owned business hav-
ing fewer than 500 employees. Generally it is not dominant 
in its field and meets industry-specific size standards for 
income or number of employees. A business is classified as 
large when it exceeds these specifications.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 How does the Small Business Administration (SBA) 
define small business? A small business is defined as an inde-
pendent business having fewer than 500 employees. However, 
those bidding for government contracts or applying for gov-
ernment assistance may vary in size according to industry.
1.2 In what industries do small businesses play a signifi-
cant role? Small businesses provide most jobs in construc-
tion, agriculture, wholesale trade, services, and retail trade. 
In addition, home-based businesses make up 52 percent of 
small businesses in the U.S.
Discuss the contributions of small businesses to the 
economy.
Small businesses create new jobs and new industries. They 
often hire workers who traditionally have had difficulty 
finding employment at larger firms. Small firms give peo-
ple the opportunity and outlet for developing new ideas, 
which can turn into entirely new industries. Small busi-
nesses also develop new and improved goods and services.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 What are the three key ways in which small busi-
nesses contribute to the economy? Small businesses cre-
ate new jobs, new industries, and provide innovation.
2.2 How are new industries formed? New industries are 
formed when small businesses adapt to shifts in consumer 
interests and preferences. Innovation and new technology 
can play a significant role. In addition, new industries may 
be created when both the business world and consumers 
recognize a need for change.
Discuss the survival rate of small businesses.
About seven of every ten new (small) businesses survive 
at least two years. But by the tenth year, 82 percent have 
closed. Failure is often attributed to management shortcom-
ings, inadequate financing, and difficulty meeting govern-
ment regulations.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 What percentage of small businesses remain in 
operation five years after starting? Ten years? About 
50 percent are in business after five years; about 82 percent 
have folded by the ten year mark.
3.2 What are the three main causes of small-business 
failure? The three main causes of small-business failure are 
management shortcomings, inadequate financing, and dif-
ficulty complying with government regulations.
Describe the features of an effective business plan.
A complete business plan contains an executive summary, an 
introduction, financial and marketing sections, and resumes 
of the business principals. Within this structure, an effective 
business plan includes the company’s mission, an outline of 
what makes the company unique, identification of custom-
ers and competitors, financial evaluation of the industry and 
market, and an assessment of the risks.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 What are the five main sections of a business plan? 
The five sections are the executive summary, introduc-
tion, financial section, marketing section, and resumes of 
principals.
4.2 Why is an effective business plan important to the 
success of a firm? The business plan puts in writing all the 
reasons the firm can be successful. It contains the written 
soul of the firm. It is the document that secures financing 
and creates a framework for the organization.
Describe funding opportunities for small businesses, 
including the role of the Small Business Administration 
(SBA).
The SBA guarantees loans made by private lenders, including 
microloans and those funded by Small Business Investment 
Companies. It offers training and information resources, so 
business owners can improve their odds of success. The SBA 
also advocates small-business interests within the federal gov-
ernment and provides specific support for businesses owned 
by women and minorities. State and local governments also 
have programs designed to help small businesses get estab-
lished and grow. Venture capitalists are firms that invest in 
small businesses in return for an ownership stake.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 What are the various ways the SBA helps small 
businesses? The SBA guarantees business loans; helps small 
businesses compete for government set-aside programs; and 
provides business information, advice, and training to own-
ers of small businesses.
5.2 What are business incubators? Business incubators 
are programs organized by community agencies that provide 
such services as rental space, clerical staff, and office equip-
ment in an effort to help small businesses get started.
5.3 Why are small businesses good opportunities for 
women and minorities? Women feel they can achieve 
more as small-business owners and can balance family and 
work more easily if they own their own firms. Minority 
business owners can receive special assistance from programs 
like the Mentor-Protégé program provided by the SBA.

Explain how franchising can provide opportunities for both 
franchisors and franchisees.
A franchisor is a large firm that permits a small-business 
owner (franchisee) to market and sell its products under its 
brand name, in return for a fee. Benefits to the franchisor 
include opportunities for expansion and greater profits. 
Benefits to the franchisee include name recognition, quick 
start-up, support from the franchisor, and the freedom of 
small-business ownership.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 What is the difference between a franchisor and a 
franchisee? A franchisor permits a small-business owner 
(franchisee) to market and sell its products under its brand 
name, in return for a fee.
6.2 What are the benefits to both parties of franchis-
ing? Benefits to the franchisor include opportunities for 
expansion and greater profits. Benefits to the franchisee 
include name recognition, quick start-up, support from 
the franchisor, and the freedom of small-business 
ownership.
6.3 What are the potential drawbacks of franchising 
for both parties? The drawbacks for the franchisor include 
mismanagement and failure on the part of any of its fran-
chisees, overexpansion, and loss of absolute control over 
the business. Drawbacks for the franchisee include an initial 
outlay of expenses, problems due to failure on the part of 
the franchisor or other franchisees; and restrictive franchise 
agreements.
Outline the three legal forms of business ownership, and 
summarize the features of businesses owned by employ-
ees and families, as well as not-for-profit organizations.
A sole proprietorship is owned and operated by one person. 
While sole proprietorships are easy to set up and offer great 
operating flexibility, the owner remains personally liable for 
all of the firm’s debts and legal settlements. In a partnership, 
two or more individuals share responsibility for owning and 
running the business. Partnerships are relatively easy to set 
up, but they do not offer protection from liability. When 
a business is set up as a corporation, it becomes a separate 
legal entity. Investors receive shares of stock in the firm. 
Owners have no legal and financial liability beyond their 
individual investments. In an employee-owned business, 
most stockholders are also employees. Family-owned busi-
nesses may be structured legally in any of these three ways 
but face unique challenges, including succession and complex 
relationships. The legal structure of a not-for-profit corpora-
tion stipulates that its goals do not include earning a profit.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 What are the key differences among sole propri-
etorships and partnerships? Sole proprietorships and 
partnerships expose their owners to unlimited financial 
liability from their businesses. Sole proprietorships are more 
flexible and easier to dissolve than partnerships. Partnerships 
involve shared work load and decision making, whereas sole 
proprietorships are entirely the responsibility of one business 
owner.
7.2 What is a corporation? A corporation is a legal orga-
nization with assets and liabilities separate from those of its 
owners. A corporation can be a large or small business.
7.3 What is the main distinction of a not-for-profit cor-
poration? A not-for-profit organization is set up legally so 
that its goals do not include pursuing a profit. Most states 
set out specific legal provisions for organizational structures 
and operations of not-for-profit corporations. They are 
exempt from paying income taxes.
Describe public and collective (cooperative) business 
ownership.
Public ownership occurs when a unit or agency of govern-
ment owns and operates an organization. Collective owner-
ship establishes an organization referred to as a cooperative, 
whose owners join forces to operate all or part of the func-
tions in their firm or industry.
Assessment Check Answers 
8.1 What is public ownership? Public ownership occurs 
when a unit or agency of government owns and operates an 
organization.
8.2 What is collective ownership? Where are coopera-
tives typically found, and what benefits do they provide 
small businesses? Collective ownership establishes an orga-
nization referred to as a cooperative (co-op), whose owners 
join forces to operate all or part of the functions in their firm 
or industry. Cooperatives are frequently found among agricul-
tural businesses. They can also occur in retail. Cooperatives 
allow small firms to pool their resources, share equipment and 
expertise, and help each other through difficult times.
Identify types of corporations and the levels of corporate 
management.
There are three types of corporations: domestic, foreign, and 
alien. Stockholders, or shareholders, own a corporation. In 
return for their financial investments, they receive shares of 
stock in the company. Stockholders elect a board of direc-
tors, who set overall policy. The board hires the chief execu-
tive officer (CEO), who then hires managers.

of directors, top management, middle management, and 
supervisory management.
Describe mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures.
In a merger, two or more firms combine to form one com-
pany. A vertical merger combines firms operating at dif-
ferent levels in the production and marketing process. A 
horizontal merger joins firms in the same industry. A con-
glomerate merger combines unrelated firms. An acquisition 
occurs when one firm purchases another. A joint venture 
is a partnership between companies formed for a specific 
undertaking.
Assessment Check Answers 
10.1 Distinguish between a merger and an acquisition. 
In a merger, two or more firms combine to form one com-
pany. In an acquisition, one firm purchases the property and 
assumes the obligations of another. Acquisitions also occur 
when one firm buys a division or subsidiary from another 
firm.
10.2 What are the different kinds of mergers? Mergers 
can be classified as vertical, horizontal, or conglomerate.
10.3 What is a joint venture? A joint venture is a part-
nership between organizations formed for a specific 
undertaking.

government. Imagine that you have been hired by that agency 
as a consultant to decide whether the organization should 
remain publicly owned. Research its successes and failures, 
and write a memo explaining your conclusion.
5. Identify a business and a not-for-profit organization that 
could form a joint venture beneficial to both. Either draft

Leslie Blodgett was always passionate about color, cos-
metics, and making people feel good. After college she went 
to work for Max Factor, a small firm that was acquired by 
Revlon and then Procter & Gamble. When Blodgett got a call 
from one of the investors who owned a little makeup com-
pany called Bare Escentuals, she had never heard of the firm. 
The company was the first to offer a mineral-based powder 
makeup that might actually succeed—and Blodgett was 
intrigued. “A powder foundation that was good for your skin 
made great sense,” recalls Blodgett. “But the shades Bare 
Escentuals had created weren’t working. They were gross. I 
knew complexions and how to match skin tones—and I saw 
a huge opportunity.” Blodgett went to work for the small 
firm and became CEO within a few months.
“There were seven of us in the office just winging 
it,” Blodgett admits. With her cosmetics knowledge, 
Blodgett immediately relaunched the line as bareMinerals, 
which included six eye shadows, six blushes, five powder 
foundations, and brushes—all designed to work together. 
But by the end of the first two years, Blodgett worried 
that the company wasn’t going to make it. As she was 
channel-surfing late one night, she stopped at the TV 
shopping channel QVC. As she watched, Blodgett formulated 
a plan—if she could get bareMinerals on the air, she 
knew she could sell the products. It turned out that QVC 
agreed with her, and Blodgett sold $45,000 of products 
in her first airing. The shopping channel immediately 
 re-booked her on a regular basis.
Blodgett continuously looks to her customers for 
inspiration—both for product and marketing ideas. She 
began hosting events at the boutiques, inviting customers 
to share their ideas and tips—after which she began to 
name new products after specific customers. Blodgett then 
expanded Bare Escentuals’ TV presence with infomercials 
that gave her more time to explain the products and 
application processes. Looking for a wider distribution 
network, she hounded Sephora until they offered her 
space in their stores. Shortly after that, Nordstrom came 
calling. Meanwhile, Blodgett decided that if small in-store 
events were good, bigger events were better—and she 
organized cruises for customers.
Over the next fifteen years, Blodgett brought Bare 
Escentuals, step-by-step, from small-business status 
with six stores in northern California to its recent sale to 
Japanese beauty giant Shiseido for $1.7 billion, with 130 
boutiques across the nation and 2,200 employees.

Case 5.1

Part 2  Starting and Growing Your Business
180
Blodgett herself became a cosmetics and small-busi-
ness celebrity. But the company was growing too quickly 
and she recognized that Bare Escentuals was beginning 
to lose out on sales because it couldn’t keep up with the 
demand for new products. So she hired a new chief finan-
cial officer who, with the sale of the firm to Shiseido has 
become CEO, while Blodgett has assumed the position of 
executive chairman. 
Throughout the company’s growth, Blodgett never 
lost sight of her own passion or her company’s mission to 
offer the highest-quality cosmetics that not only look 
natural but benefit the skin. She believes that making 
people feel good about themselves is her most 
important task. “I don’t want to be a business,” Blodgett 
says. “I want to be a community.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What specific factors do you believe led Leslie 
Blodgett and her small firm to success?

company. What kinds of changes might take 
place at Bare Escentuals over the next few years?

CASE 1.2
Case 5.2
When Yvon Chouinard started rock climbing as a teenager, 
he never dreamed his passion would lead to the ownership of 
two companies and a lifelong passion for preserving the planet. 
But 55 years later, the climber-businessman has joined forces 
with Walmart—a seemingly unlikely partner—to spread the 
word that sustainability is cool.
Chouinard founded Chouinard Equipment to make 
safer, more environmentally friendly equipment for rock 
climbers and mountaineers. He didn’t like the way previ-
ous generations of climbers had destroyed mountain 
environments. Patagonia, founded in 1972, offered the 
“soft” side of the outdoors—specialized clothing, boots, 
packs, luggage, and other gear. From the very beginning, 
Chouinard and his design team worked hard to develop 
products whose materials and manufacturing processes 
were eco-friendly. “The reason I am in business is I want 
to protect what I love,” Chouinard explains. “I used 
to spend 250 days a year sleeping on the ground. I’ve 
climbed on every continent. I’m old enough to have seen 
the destruction.”
In fact, in the mid-1990s Chouinard discovered that 
the cotton Patagonia was using for many of its garments 
came from industrial farms that used toxic chemicals. His 
response was swift and definite. He gave his company 
just 18 months to change completely to organic cotton. 
Chouinard has also been successful at persuading other 
businesses to go green.
For the past few years, Chouinard’s team has been 
working with Walmart to develop a sustainability index 
for its products, sharing valuable information that 
Patagonia has gained over the years. Walmart is 1,300 
times as large as Patagonia, but Patagonia has knowledge 
and experience that Walmart can use to reinvent itself as 
an environmentally responsible firm. Chouinard doesn’t 
mind sharing with a company that has such a monumen-
tal impact on the marketplace as well as the planet. 
And Walmart officials are eager to learn. The company 
plans to post scorecards in its stores, rating products 
on eco-friendliness and social impact. And it is developing 
a system to give preference to suppliers who comply 
with these steps. At one conference of Walmart buyers 
and executives, Chouinard pointed out that Walmart’s 
use of little LED lights in its stores—which seem to use 
minimal energy—actually requires 19 plants in California 
to power them. At this statement, a Walmart buyer 
stood in the audience and shouted, “We’re going to 
get rid of those!”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. The alliance between Patagonia and Walmart is 
an excellent example of a small business and a 
large business working together to achieve an 
objective. Do you think the same results would 
be possible if Walmart acquired Patagonia? 
Why or why not?
2. Walmart is learning from Patagonia. But what 
might Patagonia learn from Walmart?

Seventh Generation Cleans Up with Consumer 
Products
CASE 1.3
Case 5.3
Seventh Generation isn’t as old as its company name 
suggests. In fact, the firm has been in business for a bit 
more than two decades, merely allowing time for a second 
generation of employees to move the company’s mission 
forward. But the firm is focused clearly on the future—
seven generations in the future, to be precise. Seventh 
Generation’s mission is based on the Great Law of the 
Iroquois, which states: “In every deliberation, we must 
consider the impact of our decision on the next seven gen-
erations.” With that in mind, the company manufactures 
and sells household products carefully designed and pro-
duced to leave as little impact on the natural environment 
as possible.
Jeffrey Hollender, Seventh Generation’s cofounder 
and executive chairman, is passionate about the planet. 
“This is a moment in time that we may not have again,” 
he says of his company’s efforts to educate consumers 
about the impact of the products they buy and use—and 
its alternative offerings. It’s true that Seventh Generation 
is now a large enough company that Hollender can speak 
with a voice heard by media, legislators, and the general 
public. But it wasn’t always this way. “We started in 1988 
selling energy products like compact fluorescent lightbulbs 
(CFLs) that cost about $28 a piece,” recalls Hollender. 
His company operated out of a single room in Vermont 
with half a dozen employees. At first, most consumers 
were reluctant to pay the high price for CFLs or the firm’s 
organic bedding and cleaning products. But Hollender and 
his staff remained committed. “We basically sold products 
we needed to live a more responsible, natural lifestyle,” 
explains Hollender.
Despite the company’s small size, word about its fresh 
ideas in household cleaning and energy use spread quickly. 
“We grew a lot the first three years,” says Hollender. “We 
went from $100,000 to $1 million to $8 million in sales—
then we crashed, we hit a wall.” Seventh Generation expe-
rienced the growing pains that nearly every small business 
goes through. Hollender admits that the most difficult aspect 
of growth was realizing it had happened too fast. He cut his 
own salary, but the decision that caused Hollender the most 
pain was the layoffs necessary to keep the firm running. 
“Letting someone go because we had failed to be financially 
viable enough to employ them, that’s my failing,” he asserts. 
“Letting people go has to be the absolute last resort.”
But the firm regained its balance and began to 
grow again with a new sense of purpose. Today, Seventh 
Generation is nearing $200 million in sales, a figure 
that allows the company to hire experts in research and 
development, build stronger relationships with suppliers 
and customers, engage in business practices that promote 
sustainability, and market products that fulfill its promise 
to reduce human impact on the natural environment. 
“Growth brings credibility,” observes Dave Rappaport, 
Seventh Generation’s director of corporate consciousness.
Hollender agrees. “Our size allows a platform to influence 
the way business is done in America,” he comments. Hollender, 
who recently turned the job of CEO over to Chuck Maniscalco, 
now uses his clout to spend more time on not-for-profit envi-
ronmental initiatives such as the Sustainability Institute.
In addition, Seventh Generation has entered into a 
strategic partnership with retail giant Walmart to offer 
environmentally friendly products at more than 1,500 of 
its stores nationwide as well as on Walmart.com. As part 
of the alliance, Walmart stores will now carry a range of 
Seventh Generation’s cleaning products, including its best-
selling laundry detergent, dish soap, and cleaning spray. 
An expanded array of products, including baby diapers 
and wipes, are offered on Walmart.com. CEO Maniscalco 
is enthusiastic about the partnership. “Seventh Generation 
and Walmart are committed to helping people learn about 
natural alternatives and ways to protect themselves and 
their families,” he remarked recently. 
Jeffrey Hollender notes that Seventh Generation’s work 
is far from finished. “We need to become a business that is 
all good rather than less bad,” he states. When his company 
reaches that point, he predicts, its growth could have no 
limits.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Describe specific contributions that you believe 
Seventh Generation makes to the economy.
2. Given the high failure rate of small businesses, 
why do you think Seventh Generation has 
survived?
3. Seventh Generation is a privately held com-
pany. Create a chart showing possible benefits 
and pitfalls for the company if its management 
decided to sell stock to the general public.
4. Seventh Generation has entered into a strategic 
partnership with Walmart. Do you think this 
partnership will be a successful match for both 
parties? Why or why not?

Starting Your Own Business: 
The Entrepreneurship 
Alternative

 H ow do you get to class or to work? 
Chances are you walk or drive. Or you might ride 
a bicycle across campus or town. Craig Bramscher, 
founder and CEO of Brammo motorcycles, wants 
you to rethink your personal transportation. He 
wants to make your commute easy, fun, and 
green. Enter the Brammo Enertia—a 100 percent 
electric motorcycle that’s actually bright green. The 
Enertia not only boasts zero emissions, its lively 
grasshopper green outer shell is actually made 
from recycled water bottles. Are you interested 
yet? Here’s more: although the price tag hovers 
just under $8,000, there’s a federal income tax 
credit for purchasers; it will save you a mint on 
gasoline.
Bramscher is one of a small group of visionaries 
who recognized—and bet on—the fact that electric 
motorcycles would be the wave of the future. Unlike 
electric cars, which as of yet do not have a truly 
user-friendly model that can be widely distributed, 
electric motorcycles are already on the market 
thanks to Bramscher and a few of his competitors. 
Based in Oregon, Brammo rolls out its motorcycles 
from its 21,000 square-foot plant in modest 
numbers. But that is going to change as Bramscher 
sees a worldwide “hunger and demand” for his 
products. He claims that the plant has the capacity 
for building 10,000 motorcycles a year, and he plans 
to meet that capacity.
For the past decade, Brammo has run on about 
$15 million in seed capital that Bramscher drummed 
up through venture capital, part of which came 
through an unlikely investor: electronics retailer 
Best Buy. Currently Brammo Enertia motorcycles are 
distributed exclusively through Best Buy because, 
as Bramscher notes, they are “consumer electronics 
that you ride.” Meanwhile, in order to support his 
plans for expansion, Bramscher is searching for 
an additional $30 million in funding that he plans 
to funnel into research and development for new 
models and increased production.
Bramscher’s vision for the future of electric 
motorcycles is a natural outgrowth of a techie mind 
and an entrepreneurial spirit. After graduating from 
college, Bramscher helped run several computer 
businesses, culminating in founding the software 
development company DreamMedia, which he sold 
to US Web in the late 1990s. The sale earned him 
about $10 million—which later became part of the 
seed money for Brammo.
E-bike commuting hasn’t yet taken off, but it is poised 
to hit the big time. As commuters realize that they can 
drive a vehicle to work that is nearly silent except for 
a soft whirr, doesn’t emit any exhaust, and can travel 
nearly 50 miles at 60 mph on a single charge (plugged 
into a regular household outlet), Bramscher and his 
investors believe that a revolution in commuting will 
take place, both in the United States and abroad. 
Craig Bramscher intends to be leading the charge.1

You think you want to start and run 
your own company. Like Craig Bramscher 
who founded Brammo, you’ve got a great 
idea for a new business and you dream of 
achieving fame and fortune. If you’ve been 
bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, you’re not 
alone. More than ever, people like you, your 
classmates, and your friends are choosing the 
path of entrepreneurship.
How do you become an entrepreneur? 
Experts advise aspiring entrepreneurs to 
learn as much as possible about business by 
completing academic programs such as the 
one in which you are currently enrolled and 
by gaining practical experience by working 
part- or full-time for businesses. In addition, 
you can obtain valuable insights about the 
pleasures and pitfalls of entrepreneurship 
by reading newspaper and magazine articles 
and biographies of successful entrepreneurs. 
These sources will help you learn how entre-
preneurs handle the challenges of starting 
their businesses. For advice on how to launch 
and grow a new venture, turn to magazines 
such as Entrepreneur, Forbes, Fast Company, 
Success, Black Enterprise, Hispanic, and Inc. 
Entrepreneurship associations such as the 
Association of African-American Women 
Business Owners and the Entrepreneurs’ 
Organization also provide valuable assis-
tance. Finally, any aspiring entrepreneur 
should visit these Web sites:

What Is an Entrepreneur?
An entrepreneur is a risk taker in the private enterprise system, a person who seeks 
a profitable opportunity and takes the necessary risks to set up and operate a business. 
Consider Sam Walton, Walmart’s founder, who started by franchising a few small Ben 
Franklin variety stores, and then opened his own Walton Five and Dime stores. Forty-five 
years later, this small venture has grown into a multibillion-dollar global business that is the 
largest company on earth.

Entrepreneurs differ from many small-business owners. Although many small-business 
owners possess the same drive, creative energy, and desire to succeed, what makes entrepre-
neurs different is that one of their major goals is expansion and growth. (Many small-business 
owners prefer to keep their businesses small.) Sam Walton wasn’t satisfied with just one 
successful Ben Franklin franchise, so he purchased others. And when that wasn’t enough, he 
started and grew his own stores. Entrepreneurs combine their ideas and drive with money, 
employees, and other resources to create a business that fills a market need. That entrepre-
neurial role can make something significant out of a small beginning. Walmart, the company 
that Sam Walton started, reported net sales in excess of $405 billion for one recent year.2
Entrepreneurs also differ from managers. Managers are employees who direct the efforts 
of others to achieve an organization’s goals. Owners of some small start-up firms serve as 
owner-managers to implement their plans for their businesses and to offset human resource 
limitations at their fledgling companies. Entrepreneurs may also perform a managerial role, 
but their overriding responsibility is to use the resources of their organizations—employees, 
money, equipment, and facilities—to accomplish their goals. When Hollywood socialite 
Bobbie Weiner found herself struggling for cash, she signed up for a special-effects makeup 
course, hoping that she could earn just a few dollars working for the movie industry. But 
the result has been a huge success. She realized that specialized makeup is needed by many 
categories of people—actors, the military, Halloween revelers, sports fans, and funeral direc-
tors. After doing a few makeup jobs on horror films, Weiner was recruited to work on the 
blockbuster Titanic. That led to a rush of other movies, a contract with the military for cam-
ouflage paint, worldwide requests from funeral homes, and her own product line. Although 
Weiner is now worth millions and employs 250 people at her company—called Bloody 
Mary—she is still very much in charge of the firm’s mission, goals, and image.3
Studies have identified certain personality traits and behaviors common to entrepreneurs 
that differ from those required for managerial success. One of these traits is the willingness 
to assume the risks involved in starting a new venture. Some, like Bobbie Weiner, take that 
risk out of necessity—they’ve left or lost previous jobs or simply need a way to generate 
cash. Others want a challenge or a different quality of life. Entrepreneurial characteristics are 
examined in detail in a later section of this chapter.
Categories of Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs apply their talents in different situations. These differences can be classi-
fied into distinct categories: classic entrepreneurs, serial entrepreneurs, and social entrepre-
neurs.
Classic entrepreneurs identify business opportunities and allocate available resources 
to tap those markets. Dana Hood is a classic entrepreneur. She recognized that dog owners 
want special attention for their pets when they leave those animals in the care of others. She 
also knew that pet owners spent $3.4 billion for boarding and daycare centers during one 
recent year. So, when she founded her daycare center for dogs in Denver, she made certain 
that her services stood out from the average kennel. At For the Love of Dog, Hood and her 
staff offer customized services such as grooming and anesthesia-free teeth-cleaning, a tread-
mill, swimming pools, and water misters to cool off her customers’ pets during hot weather. 
In addition, pet owners can purchase high-end organic foods and treats, beds and toys, as 
well as other retail goods. “It’s a great way to take advantage of a captive audience,” notes 
Hood.4

While a classic entrepreneur starts a new company by identifying 
a business opportunity and allocating resources to tap a new market, 
serial entrepreneurs start one business, run it, and then start and 
run additional businesses in succession. Juha Christensen is a serial 
entrepreneur. He never earned a college degree but gained experience 
working in his family’s small aviation company outside Copenhagen. 
At age 17 he started a computer-reselling business. For more than 
two decades he has been a big player in the wireless sector: he helped 
pioneer personal digital assistants before there was a Palm Pilot; he 
persuaded some of the world’s top cell phone manufacturers to adopt 
a common operating system called Symbian; he headed Microsoft’s 
move into smart phones; a few years later he moved on to Web start-
up Macromedia and made millions when the company was sold to 
Adobe Systems. Then he created Sonopia, which leases part of the 
radio communications spectrum owned by Verizon Wireless and 
resells it to other companies who sign up their own customers. Using 
customized handsets and customer support provided by Sonopia, 
small, diverse organizations can become phone companies with their 
own networks. More recently, Christensen became a venture partner 
at Sunstone Capital, a leading European venture capital firm that pro-
vides funding for start-ups.5
Some entrepreneurs focus on solving society’s challenges through 
their businesses. Social entrepreneurs recognize a societal problem 
and use business principles to develop innovative solutions. Social 
entrepreneurs are pioneers of innovations that benefit humanity. 
When a group of seven Indian women gathered one afternoon more 
than 50 years ago to roll out dough for traditional crackers, they recognized a potential 
opportunity to produce and market this popular food for a wider audience. They established 
a women’s cooperative based on this idea called Lijjat Papad, with the intent to empower 
Indian women entrepreneurs. Since then, the cooperative’s president, Jyoti Naik, has led the 
cooperative to become one of India’s most successful business ventures. The company now 
produces a wide variety of bakery products, spices, and flour, with 62 branches around the 
country. The cooperative brand is one of the most popular and trusted in India, and viewed 
as the best-run small-village cooperative in the nation.6
Reasons to Choose 
Entrepreneurship as a Career Path
If you want to run your own business someday, you’ll have plenty of company. During 
one recent year, about 530,000 new businesses were created each month in the United 
States, with services and the construction industry experiencing the highest rates of activity.7
The past few decades have witnessed a heightened interest in entrepreneurial careers, 
spurred in part by publicity celebrating the successes of entrepreneurs such as Michael Dell, 
who launched what would become computer giant Dell following his freshman year at the 
University of Texas; Oprah Winfrey, who parlayed her career as a reporter into the media-
production empire Harpo; and Bill Gates, who left Harvard to start Microsoft with friend 
Paul Allen.

People choose to become entrepreneurs for many different reasons. 
Some are motivated by dissatisfaction with the traditional work world—
they want a more flexible schedule or freedom to make all the decisions. 
Others launch businesses to fill a gap in goods or services that they could 
use themselves. Still others start their own firms out of financial necessity, 
like Bobbie Weiner did with her makeup business. Carol Craig is another 
such entrepreneur. Craig was a flight officer and computer engineer, 
specializing in anti-submarine and subsurface warfare for the U.S. Navy. 
When unsuccessful knee surgery left her with a disabled veteran discharge, 
she didn’t know what to do. She followed her husband, also a naval officer, 
around to military posts and discovered that the military needed her after 
all—as a civilian consultant. So she founded Craig Technologies head-
quartered in Florida, which provides avionic software development, project 
management, software systems engineering, Web design, and data ware-
housing services to the military. In one decade, the firm has grown from 
one employee—Carol Craig—to more than 170 employees and $20 mil-
lion in income. Although Craig didn’t plan this to be her career, she says 
“I was never afraid of trying new things. I’m an accidental entrepreneur.”8
As pointed out in Figure 6.1, people become entrepreneurs for one 
or more of four major reasons: a desire to be their own boss, succeed 
financially, attain job security, and improve their quality of life. Each of 
these reasons is described in more detail in the following sections. 
Being Your Own Boss
The freedom to make all the decisions—being your own boss—is one of the biggest 
lures of entrepreneurship. After 20 years of working in the fitness industry, Peter Taunton 
wanted out of the big-box health club scene. But he wasn’t finished with fitness. He decided 
to create a different kind of gym, one for average people who prefer to work out without 
wearing Spandex shorts or being bombarded by loud music and big-screen TVs. Taunton 
founded Taunton’s Snap Fitness—small, 
neighborhood-oriented fitness clubs based on 
affordability, convenience, and cleanliness. Snap 
Fitness clubs—there are now nearly 2,000 fran-
chised locations—are smaller than the average 
gym but are open 24 hours a day. They feature 
up-to-date cardio and training equipment, but 
that’s about all. There are no childcare facilities 
or smoothie bars, no pools or racquetball courts. 
This means that the cost of membership falls way 
below the national average. Taunton likes the fact 
that he had the authority to put his dreams into 
action. And his customers seem to agree with his 
decisions. “People see us, I think, as a breath of 
fresh air,” Taunton observes.9
Being your own boss generally means getting 
to make all the important decisions. It also 
means engaging in much—if not all—of the com-
munication related to your business, including

Communicating by E-mail, Text Message, or 
Social Networking Updates: You Don’t Have 
to Be All Thumbs
Most entrepreneurs rely heavily on e-mail, texting, social networking updates, 
and other modes of electronic communication to reach their customers, sup-
pliers, distributors, employees, and others. Often that communication takes 
place on the run; when you’re your own boss, you are busy taking care of 
many tasks at once. Although you may consider yourself adept with the cell 
phone or smart phone keyboard, and can whip off an e-mail in no time, it 
might be a good idea to review a few etiquette tips to make sure your mes-
sages sound professional.
 • Don’t write in all caps. It makes the message sound frenetic, or as if you 
meant to be yelling at the recipient.
 • On the subject line, don’t write “Important—Please Read.” Your message 
is likely to end up in someone’s “delete” box, unread. Likewise, try to 
avoid sending any kind of “forwarded” messages—for the same reason. 
Instead, use a short but descriptive subject line so the recipient knows 
what the message is about. An example might be “Review of Tuesday’s 
Meeting.”
 • Avoid slang expressions and shorthand such as “LOL,” “ru,” and “L8.” 
Also avoid smiley or sad-face icons.
 • Be friendly but not overly familiar. Never include jokes in a business 
e-mail or text message.
 • Be brief. A short message is much more helpful than a long one. If more 
discussion is necessary, conclude with a note that you will follow up with 
a phone call.
 • Remember that your computer or your phone is like a tape recorder. 
Messages can be saved and stored. For that reason, you don’t want to 
make an unprofessional comment that could come back to haunt you. 
Never include personal messages within professional ones, and refrain 
from insults or criticisms that could damage your company’s image or the 
reputation of others.

the like. The “Business Etiquette” feature offers 
tips for professional-style communication—even if 
you’re on the run and using your thumbs.
Financial Success
Entrepreneurs are wealth creators. Many start 
their ventures with the specific goal of becoming 
rich—or at least financially successful. Often they 
believe they have an idea for a superior prod-
uct and they want to be the first to bring it to 
market, reaping the financial rewards as a result. 
Entrepreneurs believe they won’t achieve their 
greatest success by working for someone else, and 
they’re generally right. Of course, the downside is 
that when they fail, they don’t have the cushion of 
employment.
Kara Goldin was diagnosed with gestational 
diabetes while she was pregnant. One of the first 
things she cut from her diet was beverages made 
with sugar. Her blood-sugar levels improved, but 
Goldin still craved the flavor of sugared drinks. 
She couldn’t find a beverage that was sugar-
free but tasted good, so she created one. Goldin 
developed Hint—a line of sugar-free, zero-calorie 
water drinks that are flavored naturally with fruit 
such as lime and blueberry. Priced at $1.79 each, 
Hint drinks are less expensive than other high-end 
beverages. Goldin and her husband Theo, who 
is also her business partner, focused on selling 
the drinks through health-food stores and yoga 
studios, where careful consumers want health-
ful products at a reasonable price. As a result, 
Hint has been successful from the beginning. 
“Consumers want to feel as though they’ve dis-
covered something new,” observes Goldin. “They 
want to stumble upon emerging products.” With 
revenues of more than $12 million, the Goldins 
plan to expand their marketing efforts by advertis-
ing in online newspapers and magazines such as 
InStyle.10
Job Security
Although the demand for skilled employees 
remains high in many industries, working for a 
company, even a Fortune 500 firm, is no guarantee 

Chapter 6  Starting Your Own Business: The Entrepreneurship Alternative
189
of job security. In fact, over the past ten years, large companies sought efficiency by down-
sizing and actually eliminated more jobs than they created. As a result, a growing number 
of American workers—both first-time job seekers and laid-off long-term employees—are 
deciding to create their own job security by starting their own businesses. While running 
your own business doesn’t guarantee job security, the U.S. Small Business Administration 
has found that most newly created jobs come from small businesses, with a significant share 
of those jobs coming from new companies.11
Overseas, as economies are changing, workers are discovering the benefits of entrepre-
neurship compared to employment by big firms. In China, where entire industries such as 
banking, steel, and telecommunications, are government-owned, young businesspeople are 
starting their own small firms. There are nearly 500 million people under the age of 30 in 
China, and their role models are Bill Gates and Michael Dell, reports an entrepreneurship 
professor at the Europe International Business School in Shanghai.12
Quality of Life
Entrepreneurship is an attractive career option for people seeking to improve their qual-
ity of life. Starting a business gives the founder independence and some freedom to decide 
when, where, and how to work. A lifestyle entrepreneur is a person who starts a busi-
ness to gain flexibility in work hours and control over his or her life. But this does not mean 
working fewer hours or with less intensity. Generally it is the opposite—people who start 
their own businesses often work longer and harder than ever before, at least in the begin-
ning. But they enjoy the satisfaction of success, both materially and in the way they live 
their lives.
Zhena Muzyka, a single mom in California, needed a job that gave her flexibility and 
earning power. Her young son, “needed operations [for kidney disease], and the insurance 
wasn’t going to cover them. I had to come up with a job where I could have him with me 
because he had special needs,” Muzyka explains. So she combined her interest in herbal 
medicine with knowledge gained from travels in which she discovered the importance of 
fair-trade practices, to establish her firm Gypsy Tea. Today, Muzyka’s son is healthy, and 
Gypsy Tea is a multimillion-dollar firm that produces flavored teas grown on fair-trade 
farms in Peru, India, and other countries. Workers at these farms are guaranteed health care, 
clean water, maternity leave, child care, and other benefits. New products have been added 
to the Gypsy Tea line, including candles and beads. “It’s the most ‘worth-it’ thing I’ve ever 
done,” says Muzyka of Gypsy Tea.13 Another entrepreneur who has found a way to make his 
business fit his lifestyle is Amos Miller, described in the “Hit & Miss” feature.
The Environment for Entrepreneurs
Are you ready to start your own company? Do some research about the environment 
in which you will be conducting business. There are several important overall factors 
to consider. There’s the economy—whether it is lagging or booming, you may find 
opportunities. Consider where you want to locate your business. Currently, the states 
with the highest rate of entrepreneurial activity are Georgia, New Mexico, Montana, 
Arizona, Alaska, and California. And the metropolitan area with the highest rate of activity 
is Atlanta.14

Amos Miller runs a small farm in Pennsylvania that is known 
for high quality, nutrient-dense foods—goods that are increasing in 
demand. The thing that makes Miller different from other farmers is 
that he’s Amish—so he conducts his business without the modern 
conveniences that other entrepreneurs take for granted. 
A decade ago, when Amos took over Miller Farm, which was 
started by his father Jacob, the two men decided to focus on the 
increasing demand for nutrient-dense foods. Growers had already 
saturated the market with organic meats, dairy, produce, and other 
foods; but they hadn’t yet begun to fulfill consumer requests for prod-
ucts known to provide the most nutrition in every bite. So Amos and 
his father began to expand the farm’s product line to include grass-fed 
beef (no hormones or grains), milk-fed pork and veal, pastured chicken, 
and 16 varieties of vegetables (including fermented ketchup, cabbage 
juice, and tomato salsa). In addition the farm makes and sells spelt 
noodles, muffins, sourdough and soaked breads—all with organic 
ingredients.
Amos Miller does all of this, including marketing and transporting 
his products, without computers, electronics, a cell phone, automated 
machinery or farm equipment, or electricity. According to Amish cus-
tom, Miller doesn’t even drive a truck or car. He transports his goods 
to foodie events and other locations by hiring a driver and refrigerated 
truck. And he can’t allow photographers to take his picture—so no 
one who hasn’t met him in person knows what he looks like. His only 
concessions to modern necessities are a generator in order to refriger-
ate certain foods (such as cheeses) and a landline telephone in order to 
keep in contact with distributors and mail-order customers.
Miller doesn’t seem to mind that it takes a bit of extra effort to 
reach his market. He gets to maintain his traditional lifestyle while 
running a successful business. Miller Farm is now reaping more than 
$2 million in sales per year. “I can’t meet all the demand,” Miller 
admits.

Overall, the general attitude toward entrepreneurs 
in the United States is positive. In addition to favor-
able public attitudes toward entrepreneurs and the 
growing number of financing options, several other 
factors—identified in Figure 6.2—also support and 
expand opportunities for entrepreneurs: globalization, 
education, information technology, and demographic 
and economic trends. Each of these factors is discussed 
in the following sections.
Globalization
The rapid globalization of business has created 
many opportunities for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs 
market their products abroad and hire international 
talent. Among the fastest-growing small U.S. compa-
nies, almost two of every five have international sales. 
Despite her location in Wisconsin, Margaret Maggard 
sells her yoga-inspired, handmade jewelry—called Bhati 
Beads—all over the world, including to celebrities. 
The jewelry, which often features hand-carved beads strung on a soft leather cord, has been 
showcased on models in magazines ranging from Lucky and Sports Illustrated to the European 
fashion magazine Grazia.15

Growth in entrepreneurship is a worldwide phenomenon. The role of entrepreneurs 
is growing in most industrialized and newly industrialized nations, as well as in the emerg-
ing free-market countries in central and eastern Europe. However, as shown in Figure 6.3, 
the level of entrepreneurship varies considerably. Worldwide, more than 9 percent of adults 
are starting or managing a new business. Thailand leads in the number of adults engaged in 
entrepreneurial activity (27 percent), followed by Peru (26 percent), Colombia (23 percent), 
Venezuela (20 percent), Dominican Republic (17 percent), and China (16 percent). The 
United States, with more than 9 percent of adults qualifying as entrepreneurs, is currently in 
13th place.16
India has experienced a significant increase in the number of female entrepreneurs 
engaged in a wide range of business activities. Recognizing the effects that chemical-based 
beauty care products can have on consumers as well as the environment, Shahnaz Husain 
opened India’s first professional herbal salon on the balcony of her house in Delhi in 1971. 
She now runs a highly respected beauty care empire called Ayurvedic. Husain’s Ayurvedic 
products contain natural ingredients ranging from vegetables to diamond dust. “The ancient 
Indian system of Ayurveda is the oldest and most organized system of herbal healing in the 
world. I was convinced that it could offer ideal answers to cosmetic care,” explains Husain. 
“I entered highly competitive international markets, without commercial advertising or fancy 
packaging.” Ayurvedic supplies its products to high-end stores in London, Paris, and Milan 
as well as to shops located in Spain and Japan.17

What factors may have 
contributed to the 
increased globalization of 
entrepreneurship?

Part 2  Starting and Growing Your Business
192
Education
The past two decades have brought tremendous growth in the number of educational 
opportunities for would-be entrepreneurs. Today, more than 100 U.S. universities offer full-
fledged majors in entrepreneurship, dozens of others offer an emphasis in entrepreneurship, 
and hundreds more offer one or two courses in how to start a business.
In addition to traditional classroom experience, a number of schools offer oppor-
tunities to intern with a start-up or actually work toward launching a company. The 
Entrepreneurship and Innovation Group at Northeastern University in Boston, which is 
staffed by professors who are entrepreneurs themselves, provides students with the chance 
to work in entrepreneurial settings in a variety of industries including retail, commercial real 
estate development, financial services, health care, and high-growth technology.18
Besides schools, many organizations have sprouted up in recent years to teach entre-
preneurship to young people. The Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership offers 
training programs for learners from kindergarten through community college. The center’s 
Entreprep summer program, which is taught in conjunction with local colleges and uni-
versities, teaches high school juniors how to start and manage a company. Students in Free 
Enterprise (SIFE) is a worldwide not-for-profit organization in which college students, 
working with faculty advisors, teach grade school and high school students and other com-
munity members the value of private enterprise and entrepreneurship.19 The Association of 
Collegiate Entrepreneurs has chapters on many college campuses in the United States and 
Canada.
You don’t have to major in business to become an entrepreneur, but students who do 
major in entrepreneurship or take entrepreneurship courses are three times more likely 
to start their own business or help someone else start a business.20 In fact, you don’t have to 
wait for graduation to launch your first startup, and your business idea doesn’t have to 
change the world. College students are launching their own ventures—while still in 
school—in record numbers. While a junior in a cramped dorm at Syracuse University, Ryan 
Dickerson figured out how to turn his bed into a couch during the day—optimizing his fur-
niture and space. He designed a special bolster pillow the length of his bed that served as the 
“back” of the bed-turned-couch during the day. Called the Rylaxer, the pillows were first 
made locally and sold on campus, but Dickerson immediately drew up a business plan for 
selling them nationwide.21
Information Technology
The explosion in information technology (IT) has provided one of the biggest boosts 
for entrepreneurs. As computer and communications technologies have merged and dropped 
dramatically in cost, entrepreneurs have gained tools that help them compete with large 
companies. Information technology helps entrepreneurs work quickly and efficiently, provide 
immediate and attentive customer service, increase sales, and project professional images. In 
fact, technology has leveled the playing field to the point that, with the use of smartphones 
and other wireless devices, along with instant Web distribution, a dorm-room innovator can 
compete with a much larger firm. Technology has also assisted in the tremendous increase 
of homepreneurs—entrepreneurs who run home-based businesses. These successful ventures 
are described in the “Hit & Miss” feature.
Social networking has further transformed the business environment for entrepreneurs. 
According to a recent study, more than 90 percent of successful companies now use at least

one social media tool. Many entrepreneurs have fully embraced the use of sites such as 
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook as part of their business strategy. They believe that social 
media will help them reach more customers and grow faster, giving them a competitive edge. 
Eric Mattson, a researcher for Inc. magazine, believes that social networking is more useful 
to small firms run by entrepreneurs than to larger firms because “in smaller organizations, 
there is more room for innovation because it requires [fewer] processes to adopt.”22
Demographic and Economic Trends
Who might be starting a business alongside you? Immigrants to the United States are 
the most likely to start their own businesses, as well as those between the ages of 55 and 64.23 
As Baby Boomers continue to age and control a large share of wealth in this country, the 
trend can only be expected to continue. Older entrepreneurs will also have access to their 
retirement funds and home equity for financing. Many Boomers also plan to work after 
retirement from traditional jobs or careers, either because they want to or in order to boost 
income and savings.
As mentioned earlier, college students are jumping on the entrepreneurial wagon in 
greater numbers too. Alfonso Olvera started RailTronix while a student at the University 
of Houston. RailTronix is a Web-based software system that helps rail shippers in the oil 
LECTURE ENHANCER: 
Share an example of a 
successful business that was 
started by a student.
The idea itself makes perfect sense: you’re laid off from your 
full-time job, or you’ve recently moved to a new area, or you just had 
a baby. Working from home seems like the ideal solution. But until 
a few years ago, home-based businesses were not really considered 
legitimate by the business community in general. Most people viewed 
home-based work as no more challenging—or lucrative—than stuffing 
envelopes. All that has changed. Today, more than 6.6 million home-
based businesses contribute at least half of their owners’ household 
income. It is estimated that homepreneurs employ about one in every 
ten private-sector workers—and their businesses are as competitive as 
any other. Technology has made all this possible.
Some homepreneurs run businesses entirely based on technology, 
such as Web development. Stephen Labuda, president of Agency3, is 
a former programmer for Deutsche Bank, a large international banking 
firm. He built Web sites on the side for several years before he quit his 
job and made Agency3 his full-time, home-based career in Boston. The 
firm’s revenues are now in the millions and Labuda has about half a 
dozen employees. Labuda loves working from home. “I’m not intending 
to go rent office space,” he notes.
Other homepreneurs rely on technology to reach customers, fulfill 
orders, ship goods, or provide other services. When Michael and Mary 
Ferrari retired, they realized they needed to supplement their savings—
and they didn’t necessarily want to stop working. So they formed 
UnusualThreads.com based in California, which sells fashions worn 
by celebrities. The couple still only works the site part time, but they 
earn enough money to augment their savings and can take time off to 
travel. Another such homepreneur is Marco Barberini, who launched 
OvernightPetTags.com in Michigan several years ago and now grosses 
more than $8,000 a month. Barberini discovered a way to manufacture 
and ship pet-identification tags cheaper than his competition. His goal 
is to tag every pet in the United States Barberini echoes the advice of 
every successful homepreneur. “Most people give up too quickly,” he 
says. “Just make sure that [your product] is going to be something 
that’s in demand, and do it.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Could any of these home-based businesses succeed with-
out the heavy use of information technology? Why or 
why not?
2. Outline your own idea for a home-based business that 
would rely on technology.

industry track their shipments in real time. RailTronix produced $250,000 in revenues in its 
first year. Now Olvera is developing a similar system for the grain industry.24 Chrissie Harsh 
launched Chrissie’s Cookies while at the University of Texas at Austin, simply because word 
of her exceptional baking traveled around campus. Harsh’s classmates could order Finger-
Lickin Peanut Butter or Cranberry White Chocolate Chip cookies online or request special 
ingredients. Harsh uses Facebook to market her business and keep in touch with customers. 
Her Facebook page cites a bold mission statement: “Changing the world one cookie at a 
time.” Every year, Harsh bakes cookies for a local benefit that raises funds to dig drinking 
wells in Africa.25
Demographic trends—including the aging of the U.S. population, the growth of ethnic 
groups, and the predominance of two-income families—create opportunities for entrepre-
neurs. Convenience products for busy parents, foods that cater to ethnic preferences, and 
services designed specifically for older consumers all enjoy an opportunity for success. And 
as the economy fluctuates, entrepreneurs who are flexible enough to adapt quickly stand the 
best chance for success. During times when consumers are less willing to spend money, a 
shoe-repair shop is likely to have an increase in business, as would a clothing consignment 
shop. Trendsetter’s Boutique in Massachusetts makes a profit by selling used designer cloth-
ing to eager customers—teens and women—at a fraction of the original cost. One of the 
bargains includes a big bin of shoes that sell for $2 a pair. “These are a big hit,” says one of 
the owners. “Teenagers love it and they are consigning some of their clothing which is mak-
ing parents happy.”26
Characteristics of Entrepreneurs
People who strike out on their own are pioneers in their own right. They aren’t satisfied 
with the status quo and want to achieve certain goals on their own terms. Successful entre-
preneurs are often likely to have had parents who were entrepreneurs—or dreams of starting 
their own business. They also tend to possess specific personality traits. Researchers who 
study successful entrepreneurs report that they are more likely to be curious, passionate, self-
motivated, honest, courageous, and flexible. The eight traits summarized in Figure 6.4 are 
especially important for people who want to succeed as entrepreneurs.
Vision
Entrepreneurs generally begin with a vision—an over-
all idea for how to make their business idea a success. 
Then they pursue this vision with relentless passion. Bill 
Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft with the vision 
of a computer on every desk and in every home, all run-
ning Microsoft software. Their vision helped Microsoft 
become the world’s largest marketer of computer software. 
It guided the company and provided clear direction for 
employees as Microsoft grew, adapted, and prospered in 
an industry characterized by tremendous technological 
change.
Arguably, every invention from the light bulb to the 
cell phone originated from a person with vision—someone

who viewed the world in a slightly different way. Sometimes inventions have occurred out 
of necessity or even a mistake. True entrepreneurs know how to turn these situations into 
opportunities. In the healthcare field, it is well known that penicillin was created by accident. 
Products with narrower niches have found their way to market this way, too. Jodi Pliszka has 
an autoimmune disorder that causes baldness. She’s an athlete who spent years searching for 
a product that would keep her head cool and dry under helmets and during exercise. There 
was nothing on the market to serve her need, but instead of giving up, she invented one. 
The result is called HeadlineIt, a thin, lightweight disposable liner worn beneath helmets, 
wigs, and hats. Within a few years Pliszka obtained a design patent for her product, and sales 
hit the $1 million mark. Pliszka, who was first a clinical therapist and author, is now a suc-
cessful entrepreneur as well.27
High Energy Level
Entrepreneurs work long and hard to realize their visions. Many entrepreneurs work 
full-time at their regular day jobs and spend weeknights and weekends launching their 
start-ups. Many entrepreneurs work alone or with a very small staff, which means that they 
often wear most—if not all—of the hats required to get the business going, filling design, 
marketing, sales, and financial roles. Most entrepreneurs spend at least 70 hours a week on 
their new business, which can affect their other job (if they have one) and the quality of their 
personal life—at least in the beginning.28 Thus, they need a high level of energy in order to 
succeed.
Need to Achieve
Entrepreneurs work hard because they want to excel. Their strong competitive drive 
helps them enjoy the challenge of reaching difficult goals and promotes dedication to per-
sonal success. A poll conducted by About.com showed Oprah Winfrey as the most admired 
entrepreneur among adults. The first African American woman billionaire, Winfrey has built 
an empire stretching from television to magazines to radio. Her own words best illustrate 
her strong drive: “I don’t think of myself as a poor, deprived ghetto girl who made good. I 
think of myself as somebody who from an early age knew I was responsible for myself, and 
had to make good.”29 But when teens were polled by the organization Junior Achievement, 
Apple founder Steven Jobs emerged as the top pick. Teens said this was because Jobs “made 
a difference in/improved people’s lives or made the world a better place.”30 Both of these 
entrepreneurs have, in fact, achieved very lofty goals.
Self-Confidence and Optimism
Entrepreneurs believe in their ability to succeed, and they instill their optimism in 
others. Often their optimism resembles fearlessness in the face of difficult odds. They see 
opportunities where others see danger lurking. Ishita Khanna founded her not-for-profit 
organization, Ecosphere, in one of the harshest living environments on the planet, the Spiti 
valley in Tibet. Ironically, it is also one of the most beautiful—and sought after—locations 
for eco-travelers. Khanna believed that if small entrepreneurial ventures in Tibet—
particularly those run by women—could be linked, they would have more power. She knew 
it wouldn’t be easy. “Spiti’s geographical isolation and poor communication infrastructure

has been one of the major hurdles,” Khanna now admits. 
But Khanna didn’t give up, and Ecosphere recently 
received the Green Livelihoods Achievement Award from 
The Sierra Club. “There are numerous doubts that plague 
one before one takes the plunge,” Khanna says. “But if you 
are passionate about what you want to do, that is half the 
battle won already.”31
Tolerance for Failure
Entrepreneurs often succeed by sheer will and the abil-
ity to try and try again when others would give up. They 
also view setbacks and failures as learning experiences and 
are not easily discouraged or disappointed when things 
don’t go as planned. Bobbi Brown has built a big name in 
the cosmetics industry. Estée Lauder bought her company, 
and Brown stayed on in an active role. The brand faced 
some setbacks after its acquisition and sales went flat, but 
Brown never gave up. She met with the CEO, who said 
the problem was that the cosmetics were not setting them-
selves apart from the competition. Brown took the criti-
cism in stride, learned from the setback, and decided to 
change the culture of the company. She moved out of the 
GM building to a loft in the SoHo section of Manhattan, 
made advertising photographs more editorial, and 
approached the cosmetics business as if it were a magazine. 
The company’s numbers vastly improved and eventually hit 
half a billion dollars.32
When things go well, it’s easy to take personal credit. But when poor business decisions 
result in failure, it’s a bit more difficult. Truly successful entrepreneurs are willing to take 
responsibility for their mistakes. That is why an important part of launching any new busi-
ness is establishing a code of ethics, as discussed in the “Solving an Ethical Controversy” 
feature.
Creativity
Entrepreneurs typically conceive new ideas for goods and services, and they devise 
innovative ways to overcome difficult problems and situations. If we look at the top entre-
preneurs in the world, we can see that creativity is the common denominator. Inc. magazine 
presents an annual list of the 500 top small businesses, most of which were started by entre-
preneurs. The word solution is one of the most common to appear in the names of these 
companies.
Some entrepreneurs find creative solutions to problems; others find creative ways 
to accomplish a task or provide a service. Still others create entirely new products. The 
Lubbers family in Vermont started a 120-acre sustainable farm—instead of buying groceries 
with unknown or potentially toxic ingredients—in order to address the health issues suffered 
by their daughter. Today the farm earns about $100,000 a year.33

Entrepreneurs often succeed simply because they won’t give up. When 
sales of Bobbi Brown’s cosmetics line stalled, she moved the company to a 
new location and revamped its advertising. In the process, she successfully 
differentiated her company from the competition.

When you’re starting a new business, it’s easy to get caught up 
in the excitement of it: a fresh start, a new idea, visions of fame and 
fortune. It might seem harmless to present an overly optimistic sales 
picture or be a bit vague about where and how your product will be 
produced—after all, once your invention hits the stores, sales will 
skyrocket and all will be forgiven. But experts in every industry warn 
against such fuzzy communication and decision making. Not only might 
your venture fall flat as a result, but failure may come in the form of 
a damaged reputation or legal ramifications. And while you might be 
someone who can tolerate some failures, a wise entrepreneur knows 
how to prevent others—such as a failure of ethics.
Should every new business have a formal code 
of ethics?
Summary
Some people argue that writing a formal code of ethics takes too much time; others recommend out-
sourcing it to a consultant or another third party. However, the overwhelming majority of business experts 
advise taking the time and effort to develop these formal guidelines. If a company has more than one 
employee, then all employees should be required to become familiar with the code. As an entrepreneur, 
you will face many challenges and probably a few failures; but none should be a failure of ethics.

PRO
1. A code of ethics “embodies the ethical commitments of your 
organization,” writes business author Chris MacDonald. “It tells the 
world who you are, what you stand for, and what to expect when 
conducting business with you.” It also demonstrates leadership.
2. A code of ethics is a necessity in today’s business environment. 
Without it, if there is a difficult incident or event, a small firm may be 
exposed to “greater risk from regulatory and prosecutorial authorities,” 
observes Michael Connor, publisher of Business Ethics.
CON
1. Not every entrepreneurial enterprise, particularly those run by 
one person, needs a formal code of ethics. A person’s word or a hand-
shake is just as effective. The important thing is to convey integrity 
about the way your firm will do business.
2. There are too many stories in the media about businesspeople 
who have failed to make ethical decisions—and not enough accounts 
of the many entrepreneurs who conduct business every day in an ethi-
cal manner. A code of ethics will not make a bad person good; nor will 
lack of a code turn a good person bad.
Entrepreneurs and Ethics: It’s Good Business
Aaron Patzer started Mint.com in California because he and his friends and family were 
frustrated with Intuit’s Quicken products. He insisted that he could develop more 
user-friendly personal-finance software, and he did. Two years later, Patzer sold his Web site 
to Intuit for $170 million.34
When his grandmother died, college student Curtis Funk got the idea to record the 
proceedings and memories of funerals onto CDs and sell them to families through funeral 
homes. Families of deceased loved ones appreciated the CDs so much that Funk’s company, 
FuneralRecording.com located in Utah now has several employees and coordinates with 
more than 200 funeral homes around the United States to provide live streaming audio and

video, transcripts, CDs, and other services.35 Each of these ventures reflects creativity on the 
part of their founders.
Tolerance for Ambiguity
Entrepreneurs take in stride the uncertainties associated with launching a venture. 
Dealing with unexpected events is the norm for most entrepreneurs. Tolerance for ambigu-
ity is different from the love of risk taking that many people associate with entrepreneur-
ship. Successful entrepreneurship is a far cry from gambling because entrepreneurs look for 
strategies that they believe have a good chance of success, and they quickly make adjustments 
when a strategy isn’t working. An important way entrepreneurs manage ambiguity is by 
staying close to customers so that they can adjust their offerings in keeping with customer 
desires. One such entrepreneur is Kevin Mitnick. In the mid-1990s, Mitnick was arrested 
by the FBI for computer hacking, after which he served five years in prison. When he was 
released, Mitnick could have hidden his identity and started a new life—or gone on to fur-
ther crimes. Instead, Mitnick went legitimate, opening his own computer security consult-
ing company. He maintains a solid relationship with the businesses whose systems he once 
might have compromised. “The lifestyle of an entrepreneur is not so different from that of 
a hacker,” quips Mitnick. “The only thing lacking is the sneakiness, the seduction of adven-
ture.” His Nevada-based firm, Mitnick Security Company, is earning more than $750,000 
a year.36
Internal Locus of Control
Entrepreneurs have an internal locus of control, which means they believe that they 
control their own destinies. You won’t find entrepreneurs blaming others or outside events 
for their successes or failures—they own it all. 
Ralph Braun was diagnosed with a degenerative illness when he was 6 years old. By the 
time he was 14, he was confined to a wheelchair. Braun attended college for one year but 
had to drop out because he just couldn’t navigate the large campus in his traditional wheel-
chair. So he decided to design his own transportation. Within about four months, he had 
built his first scooter. Then he got a job at a local automotive supply factory, where he was 
able to get around quite easily on his scooter. People noticed, told him about friends or fam-
ily members who needed such a scooter, and he built them to order. Braun began to focus 
on the cumbersome van he was driving—and redesigned the interior of that as well, includ-
ing a lift that is now standard on buses and mass transit. Again, he received requests to con-
vert the vans of other wheelchair-bound drivers. Eventually Braun quit his factory job so he 
could focus on his business full-time. BraunAbility, located in Indiana, is now a $200 million 
empire. As he began building scooters, Braun recalls “everyone told me it wasn’t going to 
work. But when it comes to commonsense engineering, I’m very blessed. I think it is a 
[natural] ability.” Braun is clearly in charge of his fate.37

you have what it takes to become an entrepreneur. Take the test in Figure 6.5 to find out.

Starting a New Venture
The examples of entrepreneurs presented so far have introduced many ways to start a 
business. This section discusses the process of choosing an idea for a new venture and trans-
forming the idea into a working business.
Selecting a Business Idea
In choosing an idea for your business, the two most important considerations are 
(1) finding something you love to do and are good at doing and (2) determining whether 
your idea can satisfy a need in the marketplace. People willingly work hard doing something

they love, and the experience will bring personal fulfillment. The old adages “Do what makes 
you happy” and “Be true to yourself” are the best guidelines for deciding on a business idea.
Success also depends on customers, so would-be entrepreneurs must also be sure that 
the idea they choose has interest in the marketplace. The most successful entrepreneurs tend 
to operate in industries in which a great deal of change is taking place and in which custom-
ers have difficulty pinpointing their precise needs. These industries allow entrepreneurs to 
capitalize on their strengths, such as creativity, hard work, and tolerance of ambiguity, to 
build customer relationships. Nevertheless, examples of outstanding entrepreneurial success 
occur in every industry. Whether you want to build a business based on your grandmother’s 
cookie recipes or know that you have a better idea for tax-preparation software, you are 
more likely to succeed if you ask yourself the right questions from the beginning.
Consider the following guidelines as you think about your business ideas:
 
• List your interests and abilities. Include your values and beliefs, your goals and dreams, 
things you like and dislike doing, and your job experiences.
 • Make another list of the types of businesses that match your interests and abilities.
 • Read newspapers and business and consumer magazines to learn about demographic and 
economic trends that identify future needs for products that no one yet offers.
 • Carefully evaluate existing goods and services, looking for ways you can improve them.
 • Decide on a business that matches what you want and offers profit potential.
 • Conduct marketing research to determine whether your business idea will attract enough 
customers to earn a profit.
 • Learn as much as you can about the industry in which your new venture will operate, 
your merchandise or service, and your competitors. Read surveys that project growth in 
various industries.
Eric Casaburi already knew that he loved the fitness industry—he had owned two 
licensed fitness centers and liked the energy of the business. But he thought he could do a 
better job. “I felt there was a niche for a low-cost provider that gave a high-end experience,” 
Casaburi explains. And he wanted to do it with a twist. “Nostalgia for the 1980s has never 
disappeared,” he observes. So Casaburi developed the idea for Retrofitness—a chain of gyms 
along the East Coast with a 1980s theme. The gyms, which feature Retro Cardio Movie 
Theaters, RetroBlends, juice bars, bright red-and-yellow weight machines, and Rubik’s 
Cubes at the front desk. Retrofitness is a hit. While traditional gyms are struggling to hang 
onto customers, Retrofitness is swelling with new members. Why? “If you keep people 
entertained,” says Casaburi, “they don’t mind the sweat.” Casaburi doesn’t mind the sweat 
either—he plans to expand the number of Retrofitness locations to 300 over the next 
few years.38
Many entrepreneurs who start new businesses invent new products or processes. When 
that happens, the inventor–entrepreneur needs to protect the rights to his or her invention 
by securing a patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Web site (http://www
.uspto.gov) provides information about this process, along with forms to apply for a patent. 
Inventors can also apply for a patent online.
Adam Lowry and Eric Ryan started their firm, Method, because they believed they 
could make better household cleaning supplies than the larger firms. Today, they are cred-
ited with reinventing an industry, as described in the “Going Green” feature.

Chapter 6  Starting Your Own Business: The Entrepreneurship Alternative
201
Buying an Existing Business Some entrepreneurs prefer to buy established 
businesses rather than assume the risks of starting new ones. Buying an existing business 
brings many advantages: employees are already in place to serve established customers and 
deal with familiar suppliers, the good or service is known in the marketplace, and the neces-
sary permits and licenses have already been secured. Getting financing for an existing busi-
ness also is easier than it is for most start-ups. Some sellers may even help the buyers by 
providing financing and offering to serve as consultants. Most people want to buy a healthy 
business so that they can build on its success, but an experienced entrepreneur might pur-
chase a struggling business with the intent of turning it around. There are many resources 
for entrepreneurs who are considering the purchase of a business, ranging from information 
provided by government agencies such as the Small Business Administration to Web sites 
listing actual companies for sale.
Buying a Franchise Like buying an established business, buying a franchise 
offers a less risky way to begin a business than starting an entirely new firm. But franchising, 
which was discussed in detail in Chapter 5, still involves risks, and it is wise to do thorough 
research before taking the plunge. While there are a multitude of franchises from which to

Adam Lowry and Eric Ryan: There’s a Method to Their Madness
To most people, the household cleaning industry would seem to 
be as dull as dishwater—but not childhood buddies Adam Lowry and 
Eric Ryan. Where others saw dreariness, the two entrepreneurs saw 
green—in both senses of the word. They believed they could create 
more eco-friendly soaps, dishwashing liquids, and laundry detergents 
than the big companies; package them more attractively; and make 
huge profits. With their Califonia-based company Method, they have 
achieved these goals.
More than a decade ago, the budding entrepreneurs brain-
stormed about products they could reinvent that would challenge 
industry giants. What could evoke more drudgery than cleaning? Even 
the products were boring. They were made with harsh chemicals and 
packaged in dull plastic bottles. But they pulled in the profits for their 
manufacturers. So Lowry and Ryan’s solution was simple: come up 
with nontoxic products and package them in cool-looking bottles 
and jars.
Method wasn’t an overnight success. The partners’ economic 
timing was off—their first cleaning product hit the market just as 
the economy stumbled, and they ran through the $100,000 in sav-
ings they had put up as seed capital. They found themselves mixing 
batches of the cleaning brew in a bathtub and delivering orders in 
a pick-up truck. Then they maxed out their credit cards and couldn’t 
pay their vendors. “We had to appeal to the inner entrepreneur in 
each of our vendors,” recalls Lowry. “We had to sell them on the fact 
that Eric and I could do something that had never been done before.”
Slowly the cleaning tide began to turn, and a year later Method 
products were beginning to appear in about 800 stores—including 
Target. But this wasn’t enough for Lowry and Ryan; they wanted to 
make a bold statement about nontoxic cleaners. To build visibility for 
their brand, they went to well-known product designer Karim Rashid, 
who liked the idea and came aboard Method as the company’s chief 
creative officer. From there, the business took off. Because the com-
pany was so small, its innovations in product and design could reach 
the marketplace in weeks instead of months or years. Method now 
markets about 150 products ranging from hand soap to bathroom 
cleaners, and is always looking for the next new thing—as long as 
it is green. The firm’s marketing slogan, “People against dirty,” has 
caught on with consumers around the country. “Our challenge is 
getting consumers to rethink how they do laundry,” says Ryan. As 
for a business idea, they have found their Method.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Adam Lowry and Eric Ryan set challenging goals when 
they selected their business idea. They could have failed. 
Why do you think they have succeeded?
2. You often hear the advice to “do what makes you 
happy.” No one loves washing dishes or doing laundry. 
Why do you think Lowry and Ryan chose household clean-
ers as their business—what is there about the business 
that could make them happy?

choose, one area that is experiencing tremendous growth 
is firms whose goods and services are targeted for chil-
dren and their parents. These businesses offer everything 
from photography to tutoring to security. “They are 
pretty much recession resistant,” says Jeff Elgin, CEO of 
FranChoice, “since people are going to scrimp in a lot of 
areas before they start cutting stuff for their children.”39
Creating a Business Plan
In the past, many entrepreneurs launched their ven-
tures without creating formal business plans. Although 
planning is an integral part of managing in contemporary 
business, entrepreneurs typically seize opportunities as 
they arise and change course as necessary. Flexibility seems 
to be the key to business start-ups, especially in rapidly 
changing markets. But because of the risks inherent in starting a business, it has become 
apparent that at least some planning is not only advisable but necessary, particularly if an 
entrepreneur is seeking funds from outside sources. 
When Shez Zamrudeen felt she was ready to put her passion for fashion to work in the 
form of her own boutique called Deen, she developed a plan for her new business. A major 
part of Zamrudeen’s plan involved finding a way to distinguish her shop from many others 
in her New Jersey area. She decided to place her flagship store in New Jersey’s Powerhouse 
Arts District in Jersey City—complete with original art work decorating the walls. “There 
is no other boutique in the area that has an art gallery and clothing store in one,” claims 
Zamrudeen. When the recession hit, Zamrudeen was undaunted. “I had to adjust my current 
business plan and long-term goals,” she admits. “I had to be smarter and more careful with 
my inventory.” But Zamrudeen says she still plans to achieve all her business goals within 
the next five to ten years.40

Finding Financing
A key issue in any business plan is financing. Requirements for seed capital, funds used 
to launch a company, depend on the nature of the business. They can range as high as sev-
eral million—say, for the purchase of a McDonald’s franchise in a lucrative area—or as low 
as $1,000 for Web site design. Many entrepreneurs rely on personal savings or loans from 
business associates, family members, or even friends for start-up funds. Table 6.2 lists the 
common sources of start-up capital. 
Debt Financing When entrepreneurs use debt financing, they borrow money 
that they must repay. Loans from banks, finance companies, credit-card companies, and fam-
ily or friends are all sources of debt financing. Although some entrepreneurs charge business 
expenses to personal credit cards because they are relatively easy to obtain, high interest 
rates make this source of funding expensive, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) 
recommends finding alternative methods of funding. 
Many banks turn down requests for loans to fund start-ups, fearful of the high risk such 
ventures entail. This has been particularly true over the last several years. Only a small per-
centage of start-ups raise seed capital through bank loans, although some new firms can get 
SBA-backed loans, as discussed in Chapter 5. Applying for a bank loan requires careful 
preparation. Bank loan officers want to see a business plan and will evaluate the entrepre-
neur’s credit history. Because a start-up has not yet established a business credit history, 
banks often base lending decisions on evaluations of entrepreneurs’ personal credit histories. 
Banks are more willing to make loans to entrepreneurs who have been in business for a 
while, show a profit on rising revenues, and need funds to finance expansion. Some entrepre-
neurs have found that local community banks are more interested in their loan applications 
than are the major national banks.

Even entrepreneurs who have previously received funding from banks—and have main-
tained a good relationship with their lenders—have experienced a credit crunch in recent 
years. After several years in business, Kevin Semcken got a call from his loan officer inform-
ing him that the bank would no longer fund his $2.5 million line of credit. A line of credit 
is an approved loan that a business can borrow from when funds are needed. Without that 
money, Colorado-based Able Planet could no longer pay for the raw materials and manufac-
turing of audio equipment already ordered by customers like Costco and Walmart. Quickly, 
Semcken reevaluated his business plan, changed its focus, and found alternative funding.41
Equity Financing To secure equity financing, entrepreneurs exchange a share 
of ownership in their company for money supplied by one or more investors. Entrepreneurs 
invest their own money along with funds supplied by other people and firms that become 
co-owners of the start-ups. An entrepreneur does not have to repay equity funds. Rather, 
the investors share in the success of the business. Sources of equity financing include family 
and friends, business partners, venture capital firms, and private investors. Kevin Semcken, 
owner of Able Planet, was able to secure some equity funding.42
Teaming up with a partner who has funds to invest may benefit an entrepreneur with 
a good idea and skills but little or no money. Investors may also have business experience, 
which they will be eager to share because the company’s prosperity will benefit them. Like 
borrowing, however, equity financing has its drawbacks. One is that investment partners may 
not agree on the future direction of the business, and in the case of partnerships, if they can-
not resolve disputes, one partner may have to buy out the other to keep operating.
Some entrepreneurs find creative ways to obtain equity financing. Gavin McClurg 
did that when he came up with a timeshare business model for his start-up. His venture, 
called Offshore Odysseys, is actually a five-year sailing expedition aboard a $1.2 million 
catamaran named Discovery that will cover the world. Investors buy timeshare segments for 
between $20,000 and $30,000 on the journey, during which they might swim across the 
equator or paraglide above Tahiti. Shareholders may purchase more than one segment—a 
prominent Australian anesthesiologist has eight, and a former Wall Street executive owns 
six. Shareholders also pay annual fees to cover operating 
expenses as well as food and beverages on the trip. Shares 
and fees cover McClurg’s salary and living expenses—so 
at the end of the journey, he will likely have pocketed 
about $500,000 after taxes. He hopes to turn the Discovery 
into a fleet of several boats.43
Venture capitalists are business organizations or 
groups of private individuals that invest in early-stage, 
high-potential, growth companies. Venture capitalists 
typically back companies in high technology industries 
such as biotechnology. In exchange for taking a risk 
with their own funds, these investors expect high rates 
of return, along with a stake in the company. Typical 
terms for accepting venture capital include agreement on 
how much the company is worth, how much stock both 
the investors and the founders will retain, control of the 
company’s board, payment of dividends, and the period 
of time during which the founders are prohibited from 
“shopping” for further investments.44 Venture capitalists 
require a combination of extremely rare qualities, like

ship.

innovative technology, potential for rapid growth, a well-developed business model, and an 
impressive management team. 
Angel investors, wealthy individuals who invest money directly in new ventures in 
exchange for equity, are a larger source of investment capital for start-up firms. In contrast 
to venture capitalists, angels focus primarily on new ventures. Many angel investors are suc-
cessful entrepreneurs who want to help aspiring business owners through the familiar dif-
ficulties of launching their businesses. Angel investors back a wide variety of new ventures. 
Because most entrepreneurs have trouble finding wealthy private investors, angel networks 
form to match business angels with start-ups in need of capital.
The Small Business Administration’s Active Capital provides online listings to connect 
would-be angels with small businesses seeking financing. Venture capitalists that focus on 
women include Isabella Capital (http://www.fundisabella.com) and Springboard Enterprises 
(http://springboardenterprises.org). Those interested in minority-owned business include the 
U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (http://www.ushcc.com).
Government Support for New Ventures
Federal, state, and local governments support new ventures in a number of ways, as 
discussed in Chapter 5. The Small Business Administration (SBA), state and local agencies, 
as well as business incubators all offer information, resources, and sometimes even access to 
financing for entrepreneurs. 
Another way to encourage entrepreneurship is through enterprise zones, specific geo-
graphic areas designated for economic revitalization. Enterprise zones encourage investment, 
often in distressed areas, by offering tax advantages and incentives to businesses locating 
within the boundaries of the zone. The state of Florida has 56 enterprise zones and allows a 
business located within urban zones to take tax credits for 20 or 30 percent of wages paid to 
new employees who reside within the urban enterprise zone. Colorado has 16 zones, while 
Ohio has designated 19 zones. 
Government legislation can also encourage investment in the U.S. economy. The 
Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT 90) recognizes the growing globalization of business. 
It contains a provision that sets aside visas for immigrants wishing to invest money in a new 
venture in a targeted employment area—a rural area or an area that has experienced an unem-
ployment rate of at least 150 percent of the national average. In addition, IMMACT 90 
enables more experts in the fields such as science, engineering, and computer programming 
to be hired by U.S. firms.45
Intrapreneurship
Established companies try to retain the entrepreneurial spirit by encouraging 
intrapreneurship, the process of promoting innovation within their organizational 
structures. Today’s fast-changing business climate compels established firms to innovate 
continually to maintain their competitive advantages.
Many companies encourage intrapreneurship—30 percent of large firms now allocate 
funds toward intrapreneurship.46 Perhaps none has benefited more from the practice than 
3M. To foster creativity, 3M encourages engineers to “bootleg,” or borrow up to 15 percent

of their time from other assignments to explore new product ideas of their choosing. 
Bootlegging has led to some of 3M’s most successful products including Scotch tape and 
Post-It notes.47
Established companies such as 3M support intrapreneurial activity in varied ways. In 
addition to allowing bootlegging time for traditional product development, 3M implements 
two intrapreneurial approaches: skunkworks and pacing programs. A skunkworks project is 
initiated by an employee who conceives an idea and then recruits resources from within 3M 
to turn it into a commercial product. Pacing programs are company-initiated projects that 
focus on a few products and technologies in which 3M sees potential for rapid marketplace 
winners. The company provides financing, equipment, and people to support such pacing 
projects.48

Summary of Learning Objectives
Define the term entrepreneur, and distinguish among 
entrepreneurs, small-business owners, and managers.
Unlike many small-business owners, entrepreneurs typically 
own and run their businesses with the goal of building sig-
nificant firms that create wealth and add jobs. Entrepreneurs 
are visionaries. They identify opportunities and take the 
initiative to gather the resources they need to start their 
businesses quickly. Both managers and entrepreneurs use the 
resources of their companies to achieve the goals of those 
organizations.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 What tools do entrepreneurs use to create a new 
business? Entrepreneurs combine their ideas and drive with 
money, employees, and other resources to create a business 
that fills a market need.
1.2 How do entrepreneurs differ from managers? 
Managers direct the efforts of others to achieve an organiza-
tion’s goals. The drive and impatience that entrepreneurs 
have to make their companies successful may hurt their abil-
ity to manage.
Identify the different types of entrepreneurs.
A classic entrepreneur identifies a business opportunity 
and allocates available resources to tap that market. A serial 
entrepreneur starts one business, runs it, and then starts and 
runs additional businesses in succession. A social entrepre-
neur uses business principles to solve social problems.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 What do classic entrepreneurs and social entrepre-
neurs have in common? They both identify opportunities 
and allocate resources to pioneer new innovations.
2.2 Is a social entrepreneur simply a philanthropist? A 
philanthropist generally promotes human welfare through 
charitable donations, while a social entrepreneur pioneers 
new ways to advance social causes and thus enhance social 
welfare.
Explain why people choose to become entrepreneurs.
There are many reasons people choose to become entrepre-
neurs. Some reasons are: desire to be one’s own boss; desire

to achieve financial success, desire for job security; desire to 
improve one’s quality of life.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 What are the four main reasons people choose 
to become entrepreneurs? People generally choose to 
become entrepreneurs because they want to be their own 
boss, they believe they will achieve greater financial success, 
they believe they have more control over job security, and 
they want to enhance their quality of life.
3.2 What factors affect the entrepreneur’s job security? 
An entrepreneur’s job security depends on the decisions of 
customers and investors and on the cooperation and com-
mitment of the entrepreneur’s own employees.
Discuss factors that support and expand opportunities for 
entrepreneurs.
A favorable public perception, availability of financing, 
the falling cost and widespread availability of information 
technology, globalization, entrepreneurship education, and 
changing demographic and economic trends all contribute to 
a fertile environment for people to start new ventures.

than 9 percent of adults worldwide are starting or managing 
a new business. As for globalization opportunities, entrepre-
neurs market their products abroad and hire international 
talent. Among the fastest-growing small U.S. companies, 
almost two of every five have international sales.
4.2 Identify the educational factors that help expand 
current opportunities for entrepreneurs. More than 100 
U.S. universities offer majors in entrepreneurship, dozens 
of others offer an entrepreneurship emphasis, and hundreds 
more offer courses in how to start a business. Also, organi-
zations such as the Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial 
Leadership, Entreprep, and Students in Free Enterprise 
encourage and teach entrepreneurship.
4.3 Describe current demographic trends that sug-
gest new goods and services for entrepreneurial busi-
nesses. The aging of the U.S. population, the emergence 
of Hispanics as the nation’s largest ethnic group, and the 
growth of two-income families are creating opportunities for 
entrepreneurs to market new goods and services.
Identify personality traits that typically characterize suc-
cessful entrepreneurs.
Successful entrepreneurs share several typical traits, 
including vision, high energy levels, the need to achieve, 
self-confidence and optimism, tolerance for failure, creativ-
ity, tolerance for ambiguity, and an internal locus of control.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 What is meant by an entrepreneur’s vision? 
Entrepreneurs begin with a vision, an overall idea for how 
to make their business idea a success, and then passionately 
pursue it.
5.2 Why is it important for an entrepreneur to have a 
high energy level and a strong need for achievement? 
Because start-up companies typically have a small staff and 
struggle to raise enough capital, the entrepreneur has to 
make up the difference by working long hours. A strong 
need for achievement helps entrepreneurs enjoy the chal-
lenge of reaching difficult goals and promotes dedication to 
personal success.
5.3 How do entrepreneurs generally feel about the pos-
sibility of failure? They view failure as a learning experi-
ence and are not easily discouraged or disappointed when 
things don’t go as planned.
Summarize the process of starting a new venture.
Entrepreneurs must select an idea for their business, develop 
a business plan, obtain financing, and organize the resources 
they need to operate their start-ups.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 What are the two most important considerations 
in choosing an idea for a new business? Two important 
considerations are finding something you love to do and are 
good at doing and determining whether your idea can satisfy 
a need in the marketplace.
6.2 What is the difference between debt financing and 
equity financing? Debt financing is money borrowed that 
must be repaid. Equity financing is an exchange of owner-
ship shares in their company for money supplied by one or 
more investors.
6.3 What is seed capital? Seed capital is the money that is 
used to start a company.
Explain how organizations promote intrapreneurship.
Organizations encourage intrapreneurial activity within the 
company in a variety of ways, including hiring practices, 
dedicated programs such as skunkworks, access to resources, 
and wide latitude to innovate within established firms.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 Why would large companies support intrapre-
neurship? Large firms support intrapreneurship to retain 
an entrepreneurial spirit and to promote innovation and 
change.
7.2 What is a skunkworks? A skunkworks project is initi-
ated by an employee who conceives an idea and then recruits 
resources from within the company to turn that idea into a 
commercial product.

Review Questions
 1. Identify the three categories of entrepreneurs. How are they 
different from each other? How might an entrepreneur fall 
into more than one category?

nesses might benefit from opening in such a zone—and how 
their success might be interconnected.
10. What is intrapreneurship? How does it differ from entrepre-
neurship?
Projects and Teamwork Applications
1. Interview an entrepreneur—you can do this in person, by 
e-mail, or on the phone. The person can be a local shop or 
restaurant owner, a hair salon owner, a pet groomer, a 
consultant—any field is fine. Find out why that person 
decided to become an entrepreneur. Ask whether his or her 
viewpoint has changed since starting a business. Decide 
whether the person is a classic, serial, or social entrepreneur. 
Present your findings to the class.
2. Certain demographic trends can represent opportunities 
for entrepreneurs—the aging of the U.S. population, the 
increasing diversity of the U.S. population, the growth in 
population of some states, and the predominance of two-
income families to name a few. On your own or with a class-
mate, choose a demographic trend and brainstorm for busi-
ness ideas that could capitalize on the trend. Create a poster 
or PowerPoint presentation to present your idea—and its 
relationship to the trend—to your class.
3. Review the eight characteristics of successful entrepreneurs. 
Which characteristics do you possess? Do you think you 
would be a good entrepreneur? Why or why not? Create 
an outline of the traits you believe are your strengths—and 
those that might be your weaknesses.
4. Many entrepreneurs turn a hobby or area of interest into a 
business idea. Others get their ideas from situations or daily 
problems for which they believe they have a solution—or a 
better solution than those already offered. Think about an 
area of personal interest—or a problem you think you could 
solve with a new good or service—and create the first part 
of a potential business plan, the introduction to your new 
company and its offerings. Then outline briefly what kind of 
financing you think would work best for your business, and 
what steps you would take to secure the funds.
5. Enterprise zones are designed to revitalize economically dis-
tressed areas. Choose an area with which you are familiar—it 
may be as close as a local neighborhood, or as far away as 
a city in which you might like to live someday. Do some 
online research about the area. Then outline your own plan 
for an enterprise zone—including businesses that you think 
would do well in the area, jobs that might be created, hous-
ing creation, and other factors.

Marco Giannini’s Dogswell: A Healthy Company after All
Case 6.1
There’s no question that pet lovers around the United 
States are willing to spend whatever it takes to enhance 
their companions’ lives—they’ll purchase gourmet food 
and treats, a variety of toys, and even services such as 
“day camp” for dogs. Marco Giannini himself is a dog 
lover. He is also a serial entrepreneur whose previous 
business—Clear Day (a natural beverage company)—
went bust about ten years ago. Giannini learned a lot from 
that experience, and when he started his new company in 
California, Dogswell, he implemented those lessons.
Dogswell is a manufacturer and marketer of natural 
dog treats with catchy names like Happy Hips and Mellow 
Mut. The treats contain supplemental ingredients intended 
to help fight conditions like arthritis and hip dysplasia, 
both of which are common among medium-sized to larger 
dogs. The treats have been a hit—within five years, 
Dogswell sales topped $17 million.
But Giannini wasn’t satisfied with just a small bite of 
the pet-care market. An entrepreneur who is well known 
for his high energy and self-confidence, Giannini also likes 
the high-stakes gamble of thinking big. So he decided 
to introduce a line of dog food. “I wanted to become a 
household name, and I figured, food was the way to get 
us there,” recalls Giannini. Dogswell’s new kibble per-
formed beautifully in taste tests—dogs chowed it down. 
Dogswell was already a national brand with a presence at 
chains like Whole Foods and Target, so it wasn’t difficult 
to get the new kibble to the shelves. But Giannini decided 
to offer coupons for a free $10.99 bag of kibble with 
every purchase of a 15-ounce bag of treats, which sells for 
about $16 to $20. The coupon promotion ended up 
costing the company $100,000 a month and failed to 
attract repeat buyers quickly enough to cover the loss.
As his company began to crumble, Giannini frantically 
searched for private-equity investors who would continue 
to believe in him and his products. His optimism paid off 
in the form of TSG, an investment group willing to take 
the risk as along as Giannini went back to his core 
business—healthy dog treats—with food following more 
conservatively. “With all the success, I had gotten cocky,” 
admits Giannini.” He acknowledges his own mistakes and 
vows to learn from them, as he did with Clear Day.
Despite the ups and downs of owning a company, 
Giannini wouldn’t be happy in any other kind of job. 
“Tolerance of small business and taking chances—doing 
what you want to do—is something that runs in my 
family,” Giannini says proudly.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Describe the entrepreneurial traits that Giannini 
has. How have these benefited him? In what 
ways might these same traits be a burden? 
2. Giannini secured financing from a private equity 
group. How will this affect his control over the 
business? What other types of financing might 
have been appropriate for Dogswell?

Part 2  Starting and Growing Your Business

One of the biggest challenges for an entrepreneur is 
getting the word out about a new business to potential 
investors, suppliers, the media, and customers. Perhaps 
that is why entrepreneurs have been so quick to embrace 
social media as a tool for communication to as many 
people as possible.
If used skillfully, many believe, social media can help 
level the playing field between small businesses and their 
giant competitors. David avRutick, co-owner of Folbot, 
a small kayak retailer, claims that without Twitter, he 
wouldn’t have as many sales as he does. “You can’t 
buy that kind of exposure,” avRutick says. Folbot com-
petes against such household names as L.L. Bean and 
Cabela’s—there’s no way the smaller company could 
challenge the larger ones without widespread interactive 
communication. Stephen Bailey, who tracks social-media 
marketing for the footwear retailer John Fluevog Boots & 
Shoes notes, “The people coming from social media have 
been buying.” How could Bailey’s company lure customers 
away from Zappos.com without social media?
However, critics point out that the use of such sites 
as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and the more recent Yelp 
have a wide range of value to small businesses. “The hype 
right now exceeds the reality,” observes Larry Chiagouris, 
a professor of marketing at Pace University’s Lubin School 
of Business. Despite the fact that the use of social media 
by firms with fewer than 100 employees doubled in one 
recent year, only 22 percent of those who responded to a 
separate survey reported a direct increase in profits as a 
result of social media use, while half said they broke even 
on the investment. Others caution that social media net-
working eats up valuable time, particularly for an entrepre-
neur whose day is usually chock full of tasks ranging from 
design to distribution, and manufacturing to marketing. 
“If you spend two hours a day on Twitter and Facebook, 
that’s 25 percent of your day!” points out Chaitanya 
Sagar, founder of a small business outsourcing company 
called p2w2. 
Most experts, including experienced entrepreneurs, 
support the use of social media, but with moderation. 
Chris Lindland, owner of Cordarounds.com, an online 
clothing retailer, advises patience. “My business has been 
visited millions of times, but I haven’t made millions of 
sales,” he comments. But he believes that his patience will 
pay off. “People have told me they finally got around to 
buying from my business after reading about it on social 
media two years ago.” Chaitanya Sagar agrees. “If you 
expect immediate sales from social media, you will be 
disappointed,” he counsels. Sagar suggests that entrepre-
neurs focus instead on marketing their brands instead of 
expecting direct sales. “If you have this perspective, you 
will be able to use social media for the right reasons and 
save a lot of time.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How do you foresee social networking changing 
the business environment for entrepreneurs? 
2. How might entrepreneurs use social networking 
media to secure financing for their businesses?

CASE 1.2
Case 6.2
Small Businesses Are Big into Social Networking
Comet Skateboards:  It’s a Smooth Ride
CASE 1.3
Case 6.3
Jason Salfi loves skateboarding. This is how many 
small businesses begin. The founder has a passion for 
something—whether it’s cooking or surfing or creat-
ing video games—and wants to turn it into a business. 
In Salfi’s case, it’s skateboarding. The company, now in 
business for more than a decade, is Comet Skateboards. 
When Salfi graduated from Cornell University, he did 
what a lot of recent graduates do: he headed west. He 
lived on a boat off the coast of California for awhile and 
partnered with a friend tinkering around with skateboards, 

Chapter 6  Starting Your Own Business: The Entrepreneurship Alternative
211
which the pair sold to other skateboard fans among their 
circle of friends. Salfidesired something more. He wanted 
to find a better way to manufacture skateboards as well 
as the means to support his newly started family. “Back 
then, skateboards were made with 7 layers of maple 
and sprayed with a lacquer based coating,” he recalls. 
“Skateboards were accounting for 35 to 40 percent of 
the natural maple being harvested each year.” Salfi loved 
skateboarding, but he didn’t like the way boards were 
made. He believed that a skateboard could be built with 
more environmentally sustainable processes and materials. 
“I wanted to start a company that would make an impres-
sion on people and build an awareness around the use of 
natural resources,” Salfi says.
Not long after he established Comet Skateboards, 
Salfi moved his company and his family back east to 
Ithaca, New York where he partnered with e2e Materials, 
a small start-up out of Cornell. The firm specializes in 
regionally sourced bio-composite materials; they manu-
facture their own soy-based resin and bio-composites that 
Salfi describes as “incredibly strong and biodegradable.” 
The formula was exactly what Salfi was looking for. He 
set up shop and hired several employees, including Bob 
Rossi, who is head of Web development for Comet as well 
as president of the Green Resource Hub, an organization 
that focuses on finding ways for businesses to practice 
sustainability.
Rossi is impressed with Salfi’s total commitment to 
finding the best way to manufacture his products, even if 
it means moving cross country. “To move your business 
into the opportunity, to create a greener product, that is 
pretty impressive to me,” observes Rossi. “There’s a lot of 
green-washing out there,” says Rossi. He knows the dif-
ference. Comet goes much farther than simply purchasing 
e2e’s materials; the firm has adopted a closed-loop manu-
facturing process, which means that it reduces or elimi-
nates waste by examining the life cycle of all the materials 
used in its manufacturing process.
It might seem like Salfi and Rossi aren’t cut from the 
same cloth as the previous generation of skateboarders—
they’re busy doing good things for the environment and 
for their community instead of rolling along the fringes of 
society like the bad boys of original skateboarding. But 
Salfi remains true to his skateboarding heritage (Rossi 
admits to being new to the sport). Comet boards have 
names like The Voodoo Doll and Shred City, and are built 
for specialists who prefer downhill or freeriding. Riders are 
invited to contribute ideas for the shapes, graphics, and 
names of new boards. Comet, which has found a way to 
actually increase profit potential by using green materials, 
receives kudos from business bloggers as well as diehard 
boarding bloggers. It appears that Salfi has found a way 
to blend doing good with doing good business—in a sport 
that was once considered far out of the mainstream.
Salfi hopes that Comet Skateboards will ultimately 
serve as an example of a small business that can make 
a big difference—while making products that provide 
fun. “We look at everything we do through the lens of 
how we can create a model that people can replicate in 
the future,” he says. Salfi observes proudly that although 
Comet has only been in Ithaca for a few years, so far the 
company has a 100-percent retention rate of employees. 
He wants Comet to be a company that is known for its 
positive working environment, a place where people can 
develop long-term careers.
“We know that in the grand scheme of things, we’re 
a small company, but through the many means of getting 
the message out—the Internet, video, music, and photog-
raphy—we can actually have a broad footprint and make 
the idea of sustainability and social justice appealing to a 
broader market,” predicts Salfi. While the bottom line—
turning a profit—is vital to Comet’s survival and growth, 
Salfi believes that this new way of doing business is more 
important in the long run. “We like to think we’re creating 
a blueprint for the kind of company that will be around 
for 100 or 200 years,” he muses. Then the skateboarder 
emerges. With a grin Salfi adds, “At the end of the day 
we’re making skateboards, and we don’t want to bum 
anybody out.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. In which category (or categories) would you 
place Jason Salfi as an entrepreneur? Why? Give 
examples.
2. Salfi notes that the use of information 
technology—part of the environment for 
entrepreneurs—can help Comet Skateboards 
reach a broader audience. Can you identify any 
demographic and economic trends that might 
provide opportunities for Comet Skateboard’s 
growth as a business?
3. Which of the traditional characteristics of entre-
preneurs do you believe best describe Jason 
Salfi? Why?
4. As Comet Skateboards reaches the next level 
of growth, where might the firm have the best 
chance of obtaining further financing? Why?

Part 2  Starting and Growing Your Business
Greensburg: A Great Place to Start
Ashley Petty started taking massage therapy classes 
while studying for her business degree. After graduating, she 
worked for several years as a massage therapist, until the spa 
where she worked closed. Ashley was job hunting when the 
tornado hit her hometown of Greensburg, Kansas. Watching 
volunteers, residents, and relief workers exhaust themselves 
cleaning up the devastated town, she saw an opportunity. She 
would return home to start her own spa in Greensburg.
It was definitely a risky venture—the last thing she 
would have expected to find in Greensburg before the 
storm. Armed with a business plan she had written in col-
lege, Ashley drove to Town Hall and applied for one of the 
temporary trailers that were brought in to house displaced 
businesses. She got her trailer—a 1970s singlewide, complete 
with imitation wood paneling, stinky carpet, and a leaky roof. 
Not exactly the luxe spa she had envisioned in her business 
plan, but a good enough start. With a fresh coat of paint, 
some scented candles, and new drapes, she opened Elements 
Therapeutic Massage and Day Spa.
Ashley had expected that her spa would be a hard sell. 
The storm had destroyed the town’s communications, so 
traditional advertising was out. To build a client base, Ashley 
turned to word of mouth. She went to town meetings, talked 
to old friends, met with volunteers from all over the country. 
Still, months went by and she still had barely enough clients 
to pay her expenses.
Winter hit. It was cold, the ancient furnace ran con-
stantly, drafts blew in the new curtains, and rain soaked the 
freshly steamed carpet. Elements was the last place anyone 
would want to go to escape the stress of rebuilding—even 
Ashley couldn’t stand to be there. Under normal circum-
stances, she would have considered more extensive capital 
improvements, but the trailer was only temporary and she 
was out of money.
At one town meeting, green architecture firm BNIM 
presented a plan for the new Downtown Greensburg, 
including a business incubator to sustain old businesses and 
promote new ones. Traditionally, a business incubator is 
reserved for start-ups, but in Greensburg, once-successful 
businesses needed help getting back on their feet. The incu-
bator would be housed in a totally energy-efficient retail/
office building with space for approximately ten new busi-
nesses. The rent would be reasonable, and the utility costs 
next to nothing. Ashley jumped at the chance to apply for a 
place in the building.
Questions
After viewing the video, answer the following questions:
1. What major challenges does Ashley Petty face in starting 
her business?
2. How will Greensburg’s business incubator stimulate eco-
nomic development?
3. What are some of the challenges Greensburg faces in 
recruiting new businesses? What incentives would you 
offer to encourage new business development there?
4. Would you start a new business in Greensburg? Why or 
why not?

L A U N C H I N G  Y O U R 
Entrepreneurial Career
In Part 2, “Starting and Growing 
Your Business,” you learned about 
the many ways that business owners 
have achieved their dreams of owning 
their own company and being their 
own boss. The part’s two chapters 
introduced you to the wide variety of 
entrepreneurial or small businesses; 
the forms they can take—sole 
proprietorship, partnership, or 
corporation—and the reasons that 
some new ventures succeed and others 
fail. You learned that entrepreneurs 
are visionaries who build firms that 
create wealth and that they share traits 
such as vision and creativity, high 
energy, optimism, a strong need to 
achieve, and a tolerance for failure. By 
now you might be wondering how you 
can make all this information work for 
you. Here are some career ideas and 
opportunities in the small-business and 
e-business areas.
First, whatever field attracts you 
as a future business owner, try to 
acquire experience by working for 
someone else in the industry initially. 
The information and skills you pick 
up will be invaluable when you start 
out on your own. Lack of experience 
is often cited as a leading reason for 
small-business failure.1
Next, look for a good fit between 
your own skills, abilities, and charac-
teristics and a market need or niche. 
For instance, the U.S. Department 
of Labor reports that opportunities 
in many healthcare fields are rising 
with the nation’s increased demand 
for health services.2 As the population 
of older people rises, and as young 
families find themselves increas-
ingly pressed for time, the need for 
child care and elder services will also 
increase—and so will the opportuni-
ties for new businesses in those areas. 
So keep your eyes on trends to find 
ideas that you can use or adapt.
Another way to look for market 
needs is to talk to current custom-
ers or business associates. When 
the owner of Michigan-based Moon 
Valley Rustic Furniture wanted to 
retire, he went to see Rick Detkowski, 
who was in the real estate business. 
The owner intended to offer the 
buildings to Detkowski and close the 
business down. But the real estate 
agent, who owned several pieces 
of Moon Valley furniture himself, 
instead decided to buy, not just the 
buildings, but the furniture 
business, too. Before the sale was 
completed—and to determine 
whether he could run Moon Valley 
profitably—Detkowski talked with 
existing customers and furniture deal-
ers, who had been hoping for years 
that the company would expand its 
line of sturdy cedar and pine items 
from the traditional summer lawn fur-
niture into more innovative designs. 
Further research showed that the 
general environmental trend among 
consumers was boosting demand for 
rustic furniture, in contrast with the 
overall housing slump. So Detkowski 
took the plunge and is now in the fur-
niture manufacturing business. He has 
expanded the company’s product lines 
and reorganized the factory floor for 
more efficiency—and cost savings.3
Are you intrigued by the idea 
of being your own boss but worried 
about risking your savings to get a 
completely new and untried busi-
ness off the ground? Then owning a 
franchise, such as Quiznos or Dunkin’ 
Donuts, might be for you. The Small 
Business Administration advises aspir-
ing entrepreneurs that while franchis-
ing can be less risky than starting 
a new business from scratch, it still 
requires hard work and sacrifice. In 
addition, you need to completely 
understand both the resources to 
which you’ll be entitled and the 
responsibilities you’ll assume under 
the franchise agreement. Again, filling 
a market need is important for suc-
cess. To find more information about 
franchising, access the Federal Trade 
Commission’s consumer guide to buy-
ing a franchise at http://www.ftc.gov/
bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/invest/inv05.
shtm.
Are you skilled in a particular area 
of business, technology, or science? 
The consulting industry will be a 
rapidly growing area for several years, 
according to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics.4 Consulting firms offer 
their expertise to clients in private, 
government, not-for-profit, and even 
foreign business operations. Business 
consultants influence clients’ decisions 
in marketing, finance, manufactur-
ing, information systems, e-business, 
human resources, and many other 
areas including corporate strategy and 
organization. Technology consultants 
support businesses in all fields, with 
services ranging from setting up a 
secure Web site or training employees 
in the use of new software to manag-

for disaster recovery. Science consult-
ing firms find plenty of work in the 
field of environmental consulting, 
helping businesses deal with pollution 
cleanup and control, habitat protec-
tion, and compliance with govern-
ment’s environmental regulations and 
standards.
But perhaps none of these areas 
appeal to you quite so much as 
tinkering with gears and machinery 
or with computer graphics and code. 
If you think you have the insight and 
creativity to invent something 
completely new, you need to make 
sure you’re informed about patents, 
trademarks, and copyright laws to 
protect your ideas.5 Each area offers 
different protections for your work, 
and none will guarantee success.

Career Assessment Exercises in 
Entrepreneurship and Business 
Ownership
1. Find out whether you have what 
it takes to be an entrepreneur. 
Review the material on the SBA’s 
Web site http://www.sba.gov/
smallbusinessplanner/index
.html. or take the Brigham Young 
University’s Entrepreneurial Test 
at http://marriottschool.byu.edu/
cfe/startingout/test.cfm. Answer 
the questions there. After you’ve 
finished, use the scoring guides 
to determine how ready you 
are to strike out on your own. 
What weak areas did your results 
disclose? What can you do to 
strengthen them?
2. Find an independent business or 
franchise in your area, and make 
an appointment to talk to the 
owner about his or her start-up 
experience. Prepare a list of ques-
tions for a 10- to 15-minute inter-
view, and remember to ask about 
details such as the number of 
hours worked per week, approxi-
mate start-up costs, goals of the 
business, available resources, les-
sons learned since opening, and 
rewards of owning the business. 
How different are the owner’s 
answers from what you expected?
3. Search online for information 
about how to file for a patent, 
trademark, or copyright. A good 
starting point is http://www.uspto.
gov. Assume you have an inven-
tion you wish to protect. Find out 
what forms are required; what fees 
are necessary; how much time is 
typically needed to complete the 
legal steps; and what rights and 
protections you will gain.

 W hat’s it like to be one of the most powerful 
businesswomen in the United States? Indra Nooyi 
is CEO of PepsiCo—one of the largest consumer 
companies in the world with corporate headquarters 
in New York. She’d probably answer that her job 
represents a huge challenge as well as a great 
opportunity. Nooyi, who grew up in India, spent 
each evening at dinner engaged in competition 
with her sister to solve a world problem presented 
by their mother. Today, Nooyi travels the world 
in search of opportunities and challenges for her 
company.
As CEO of a global firm, Nooyi is engaged in 
planning her company’s strategy for the long term. 
She also likes to see for herself what is happening 
in the marketplace. Recently she has devoted a lot 
of time and attention to China, where Pepsi—which 
makes Lay’s potato chips and other snacks—
operates vast potato farms. Nooyi doesn’t just stay 
in conference rooms chatting with other executives; 
she also gets out to the farms. This is because China 
is not only a supplier of raw materials for Pepsi’s 
products, it is also a huge potential consumer 
market of more than 1 billion people. “China 
represents our single largest opportunity today 
outside the U.S.,” Nooyi notes. “It’s going to remain 
that way and will extend that lead.” Pepsi already 
has a third of the market in China for carbonated 
beverages—and lays claim to the most popular cola 
there. “The opportunity is enormous,” says Nooyi, 
observing that young Chinese consumers prefer 
foreign brands. So China is a big part of PepsiCo’s 
long-range planning.
As for product-related planning, Nooyi has backed 
the effort to offer more healthful Pepsi products 
as consumers demand them. The firm recently 
announced its goal to cut the sodium in each 
serving of its top products by 25 percent over the 
next five years. Over the next ten years, Pepsi’s 
objective is to cut the average added sugar per 
serving by 25 percent and saturated fat by 
15 percent. Pepsi adopted guidelines to stop 
selling sugared drinks in U.S. schools several 
years ago.
Nooyi is known for her assertive leadership style, 
evident in a recent move by Pepsi to acquire its 
two largest bottlers—Pepsi Bottling Group and 
Pepsi Americas. She’s outspoken in her views 
about everything from the creation of jobs to 
emerging markets. And she views PepsiCo as an 
important player in the global economy, including 
emerging markets. “The one thing about PepsiCo 
is that we are a global company, a great global 
company, headquartered in the United States, 
but we are local in every company in which we 
operate because you cannot export soft drinks 
and chips. You have to be local.” Which markets 
does Nooyi view as important to Pepsi’s 
planning? South America is particularly vibrant. 
“Especially in markets like Brazil, there is a lot 
of optimism; people are feeling great about that 
market,” she comments. Nooyi also has her 
eye on her native country of India. “In markets 
like India we are seeing a level of excitement 
that is unbelievable.” Under the direction of 
Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo plans to be part of that 
excitement.1

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
A management career brings challenges 
that appeal to many students in introduc-
tory business courses. When asked about 
their professional objectives, many students 
say, “I want to be a manager.” You may think 
that the role of a manager is basically being 
the boss. But in today’s business world, 
companies are looking for much more than 
bosses. They want managers who understand 
technology, can adapt quickly to change, 
can skillfully motivate employees, and real-
ize the importance of satisfying customers. 
Managers who can master those skills will 
continue to be in great demand because their 
commitment strongly affects their firms’ 
performance.
This chapter begins by examining how 
successful organizations use management to 
turn visions into reality. It describes the levels 
of management, the skills that managers 
need, and the functions that managers per-
form. The chapter explains how the first of 
these functions, planning, helps managers 
meet the challenges of a rapidly changing 
business environment and develop strategies 
that guide a company’s future. Other 
sections of the chapter explore the types 
of decisions that managers make, the role of 
managers as leaders, and the importance 
of corporate culture. The chapter concludes 
by examining the second function of 
management—organizing.
Overview

What Is Management?
Management is the process of achieving organizational objectives through people and 
other resources. The manager’s job is to combine human and technical resources in the best 
way possible to achieve the company’s goals.
Management principles and concepts apply to not-for-profit organizations as well as 
profit-seeking firms. A city mayor, the president of the Appalachian Mountain Club, and 
a superintendent of schools all perform the managerial functions described later in this 
chapter. Management happens at many levels, from that of a family-owned restaurant 
manager to a national sales manager for a major manufacturer.
The Management Hierarchy
Your local supermarket works through a fairly simple organization that consists of a 
store manager, several assistant or department managers, and employees who may range 
from baggers to cashiers to stock clerks. However, if your supermarket is part of a regional 
or national chain, there will be corporate managers above the store manager. The Stop & 
Shop Supermarket Company has more than 350 supermarkets located from New Hampshire 
to New Jersey, as well as headquarters located in Massachusetts. Within each store 
there are managers for everything from the meat department to human resources. But at

achieving organizational 
objectives through people 
and other resources.

Chapter 7  Management, Leadership, and the Internal Organization
219
Stop & Shop headquarters, you’ll find top-level managers 
for such functions as finance, consumer affairs, real estate, 
information technology, sales and operations, and pharmacy 
among others.2
All of these people are managers because they combine 
human and other resources to achieve company objectives. 
Their jobs differ, however, because they work at different 
levels of the organization.
A firm’s management usually has three levels: top, middle, 
and supervisory. These levels of management form a manage-
ment hierarchy, as shown in Figure 7.1. The hierarchy is the 
traditional structure found in most organizations. Managers 
at each level perform different activities.
The highest level of management is top management. Top 
managers include such positions as chief executive officer 
(CEO), chief financial officer (CFO), and executive vice pres-
ident. Top managers devote most of their time to developing 
long-range plans for their organizations. They make deci-
sions such as whether to introduce new products, purchase other companies, or 
enter new geographical markets. Top managers set a direction for their organization 
and inspire the company’s executives and employees to achieve their vision for the 
company’s future.
The job isn’t easy. Many top managers must steer their firms through the storms of an 
economic downturn, a slump in sales, a quality crisis, and the like. Taleo’s chief executive, 
Michael Gregoire, is one such manager. Despite a recession and a major accounting review 
of the firm, Gregoire kept California-based Taleo—which makes software that tracks job 
applicant and employee data—afloat. While Gregoire dealt with financial, legal, and tech-
nological issues, he also found a way to keep his employees motivated and focused on their 
own jobs. “My job was to keep the company moving forward,” Gregoire notes. He recalls 
that every day he walked into the office and reassured his employees that doing their own 
jobs was the most important thing. “What we can do is take care of our customers,” he 
told his workers. “We can build great software. We can sell software.” Today, Taleo’s 
customers are happy with Taleo’s software products and the firm’s earnings are up 
significantly.3
Middle management, the second tier in the management hierarchy, includes positions 
such as general managers, plant managers, division managers, and branch managers. Middle 
managers’ attention focuses on specific operations, products, or customer groups within an 
organization. They are responsible for developing detailed plans and procedures to imple-
ment the firm’s strategic plans. If top management decided to broaden the distribution of a 
product, a sales manager would be responsible for determining the number of sales person-
nel required. Middle managers are responsible for targeting the products and customers 
who are the source of the sales and profit growth expected by their CEOs. To achieve these 
goals, middle managers might budget money for product development, identify new uses for 
existing products, and improve the ways they train and motivate salespeople. Because they 
are more familiar with day-to-day operations than CEOs, middle managers often come up 
with new ways to increase sales or solve company problems.
Supervisory management, or first-line management, includes positions such as supervi-
sor, section chief, and team leader. These managers are directly responsible for assigning

nonmanagerial employees to specific jobs and evaluating their performance. Managers at 
this first level of the hierarchy work directly with the employees who produce and sell the 
firm’s goods and services. They are responsible for implementing middle managers’ plans by 
motivating workers to accomplish daily, weekly, and monthly goals. In BusinessWeek’s most 
recent annual ranking of customer service champs, all of the top-ranked firms have first-line 
managers who implement the firms’ strategies to provide superior customer service. 
L.L. Bean, Nordstrom, the Ritz-Carlton, and Ace Hardware all have in common first-line 
managers who see that customer service is a top priority among its employees.4
Skills Needed for Managerial Success
Managers at every level in the management hierarchy must exercise three basic types of 
skills: technical, human, and conceptual. All managers must acquire these skills in varying 
proportions, although the importance of each skill changes at different management levels.
Technical skills are the manager’s ability to understand and use the techniques, knowledge, 
and tools and equipment of a specific discipline or department. Technical skills are especially 
important for first-line managers and become less important at higher levels of the management 
hierarchy. But most top executives started out as technical experts. The résumé of a vice 
president for information systems probably lists experience as a computer analyst and that of a 
vice president for marketing usually shows a background in sales. Many firms, including Home 
Depot and Dell have increased training programs for first-line managers to boost technical skills 
and worker productivity. Cold Stone Creamery, which operates franchises for its premium 
ice-cream stores nationwide, carefully trains managers and crew members in the art of preparing 
its specialty ice cream for hungry customers. “We set high standards and provide world-class 
training,” says the company.5
L.L. Bean ranks in the top tier of BusinessWeek’s annual top customer-service providing companies. The first-line 
managers make sure that customer service is a priority for all employees.

Human skills are interpersonal skills that enable managers to work effectively with and 
through people. Human skills include the ability to communicate with, motivate, and lead 
employees to complete assigned activities. Managers need human skills to interact with people 
both inside and outside the organization. It would be tough for a manager to succeed without 
such skills, even though they must be adapted to different forms—for instance, mastering and 
communicating effectively with staff through e-mail, cell phones, pagers, faxes, and text 
messaging, all of which are widely used in today’s offices. As you can imagine, it is important 
for managers of Cold Stone Creamery ice cream stores to have excellent human skills not only 
with customers but also with employees.
Conceptual skills determine a manager’s ability to see the organization as a unified 
whole and to understand how each part of the overall organization interacts with other 
parts. These skills involve an ability to see the big picture by acquiring, analyzing, and 
interpreting information. Conceptual skills are especially important for top-level managers, 
who must develop long-range plans for the future direction of their organization. After sell-
ing his own company, LinkExchange, to Microsoft for $265 million, Tony Hsieh 
joined Zappos as an advisor and eventually became its CEO. Hsieh’s conceptual skills 
helped Zappos to grow sales to more than $1 billion annually while at the same time win-
ning accolades for being an excellent place to work. Recently, Hsieh helped engineer the 
sale of Zappos to Amazon in a deal worth $1.2 billion.6
Managerial Functions
In the course of a typical day, managers spend time meeting and talking with people, 
reading, thinking, and sending text or e-mail messages. As they perform all these activities, 
managers are carrying out four basic functions: planning, organizing, directing, and control-
ling. Planning activities lay the groundwork, and the other functions are aimed at carrying 
out the plans.
Planning Planning is the process of anticipating future events and conditions and 
determining courses of actions for achieving organizational objectives. Effective planning 
helps a business focus its vision, avoid costly mistakes, and seize opportunities. Planning 
should be flexible and responsive to changes in the business environment, and should involve 
managers from all levels of the organization. As global competition intensifies, technology 
expands, and the speed at which firms bring new innovations to market increases, planning 
for the future becomes even more critical. For example, a CEO and other top-level manag-
ers need to plan for succession—those who will follow in their footsteps. Some CEOs resist 
this kind of planning, fearing that doing so might shorten their time at the helm of a com-
pany. But management experts encourage planning ahead for the next generation of manage-
ment, in order to keep the company’s position in the marketplace strong.7
After 32 years of leadership at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, 
David Fish will retire from his position as president and CEO and transition to a new senior 
advisor role. Former St. Joseph’s chief operating officer (COO), Joan Coffman, was named 
the incoming president and CEO for the hospital. Because Coffman was in a senior leader-
ship position and Fish will still be involved with St. Joseph’s as an advisor, the transition of 
leadership was well thought-out through careful planning.8
Organizing Once plans have been developed, the next step in the management pro-
cess typically is organizing—the process of blending human and material resources through 
a formal structure of tasks and authority; arranging work, dividing tasks among employees,

222
Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
and coordinating them to ensure implementation of plans and accomplishment of objec-
tives. Organizing involves classifying and dividing work into manageable units with a logical 
structure. Managers staff the organization with the best possible employees for each job. 
Sometimes the organizing function requires studying a company’s existing structure and 
determining whether to restructure it in order to operate more efficiently, cost effectively, or 
sustainably.
Directing Once an organization has been established, managers focus on directing, 
or guiding and motivating employees to accomplish organizational objectives. Directing 
might include training (or retraining), setting up schedules, delegating certain tasks, and 
monitoring progress. To fulfill the objective of reducing the office electricity bill, an office 
manager might have incandescent light bulbs replaced by compact fluorescents, ask employ-
ees to turn off the lights when they leave a room and direct the IT staff to program all the 
office computer screens to turn off after 15 minutes of inactivity.9
Often when managers take time to listen to their employees, the manager gains insight 
and the employee gets a motivational boost. Christopher Mills, co-owner of Prime Debt 
Services in Dallas, meets with employees each week. “I found the more I listened, the better 
they pepped up,” he says.10
Controlling The controlling function evaluates an organization’s performance 
against its objectives. Controlling assesses the success of the planning function and provides 
feedback for future rounds of planning.
The four basic steps in controlling are to establish performance standards, monitor 
actual performance, compare actual performance with established standards, and make cor-
rections if necessary. Under the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, for example, CEOs 
and CFOs must monitor the performance of the firm’s accounting staff more closely than 
has been done in the past. They must personally attest to the truth of financial reports filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Setting a Vision and Ethical 
Standards for the Firm
A business begins with a vision, its founder’s perception of marketplace needs and 
the ways a firm can satisfy them. Vision serves as the target for a firm’s actions, helping 
direct the company toward opportunities and differentiating it from its competitors. “My 
whole vision is to build an online empire,” says Troy Rhodes Jr., founder of Missouri-based 
MyBookBorrow.com. Rhodes, who started his business while a student at the University of 
Missouri, isn’t daunted by giant competitors like Amazon or eBay.11
Another Missouri-based company, Garmin, which manufactures popular GPS (global 
positioning system) navigation devices, was founded on the “principles of innovation, conve-
nience, performance, value, and service.” Co-founders Gary Burrell and Dr. Min Kao state 
that the firm’s mission is “to create navigational and communication devices that can enrich 
our customers’ lives.”12
A company’s vision must be focused and yet flexible enough to adapt to changes in the 
business environment. Also critical to a firm’s long-term relationship with its customers, sup-
pliers, and the general public are the ethical standards that top management sets. Sometimes

When Google first entered the Chinese market, the firm was bat-
tered by criticism for its agreement to a compromise on censorship with 
the Chinese government, which controls the distribution of information 
to its public. Google did so in the hope that the Chinese government 
would eventually relax its stand and allow its citizens the same access 
to Internet information as others have around the world. But that 
didn’t happen—in fact, censorship seemed to grow tighter, along with 
evidence that someone was using Google to identify Chinese 
dissidents. So, Google announced that it was shutting down operations 
in China and rerouting users to a safe site in Hong Kong. While Google 
received praise from the Internet community for its move, the firm got 
only lackluster support from the business world.
Should the ethical standards set by a U.S. business 
override repressive laws and regulations established 
by any of the countries in which it operates?
Summary
Google’s exit from China was a clear-cut decision to some people; to others, it was not. “China is a 
very important market,” noted one analyst. “What’s the incentive for a government or another company to 
join with Google? There is none and that’s why you haven’t seen it happen.” Others point out that while 
China represents a market of more than 1 billion consumers, it is hard to predict how open that market will 
be in the next five or ten years. Complicating things further, “there is a barrage of new rules and regula-
tions for foreign companies operating in China,” notes a businessperson with experience in China. “And 
everybody is trying to figure out what it means.”

PRO
1. Many multinational firms now have global ethics policies that 
apply to each country in which they do business, regardless of national 
law. This helps managers make consistent decisions, even if it means 
losing some profits.
2. Ethical standards must always take precedence over practices 
that compromise human rights. “If any corporate executive finds that 
he or she is actually considering putting profit ahead of humanity,” 
argues Mickey Edwards, vice president of the international nonprofit 
Aspen Institute, “it is time for that person to reflect seriously on how 
and when the moral compass, and one’s own claim to humanity, 
got lost.”
CON
1. Ethical standards are not always the same from one country 
to the next. Google’s move may, in fact, have a negative impact on 
Chinese consumers who at least had access to some information while 
Google was there. “Leaving may look and feel great to those of us 
in the West, but exiting a market may not always have the desired 
impact,” writes one expert.
2. Companies willing to compromise with such governments could 
actually use their influence with consumers to drive change. One way 
to do this is to create demand for their goods and services. Another 
is to become active in the community through service projects such as 
building schools.
Google Stands Alone: When Ethics and Business Don’t Mix
ethical standards are set in compliance with industry or federal regulations, such as safety 
or quality standards. Sometimes new standards are set in response to unethical actions by 
managers, such as the financial accounting activities that resulted in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
Currently, firms are taking a closer look at large compensation packages received by their 
CEOs and other top executives. Due to public outcry, compensation committees are reevalu-
ating their criteria for salaries, bonuses, and other benefits.13
The ethical tone that a top management team establishes can reap monetary as well as 
nonmonetary rewards. Setting a high ethical standard does not merely restrain employees 

224
Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
from doing wrong, but it encourages, motivates, 
and inspires them to achieve goals they never 
thought possible. Such satisfaction creates a 
more productive, stable workforce—one that 
can create a long-term competitive advantage 
for the organization. In practice, ethical deci-
sions are not always clear-cut, and managers 
must make difficult decisions. Sometimes a firm 
operates in a country where standards differ 
from those in the United States. In other situa-
tions, a manager might have to make an ethical 
decision that undermines profits or even causes 
people to lose their jobs. And while it’s tempt-
ing to think that a large firm—by virtue of its 
size—will have a harder time adopting ethical 
practices than a small firm, consider toymaker 
giant Mattel, which has repeatedly earned rec-
ognition for its ethical standards. Named one of 
the “World’s Most Ethical Companies” by the 
Ethisphere Institute, California-based Mattel 
consistently demonstrates high standards in a 
number of areas. “Our commitment to ‘play 
fair’ is at the core of our organization’s culture and is the cornerstone of our ethical compli-
ance program,” notes chairman and CEO Robert A. Eckert.
Alex Brigham, executive director of the New York–based Ethisphere Institute, observes 
the connection between ethics and good business. “Mattel’s promotion of a sound ethical 
environment shines within its industry and shows a clear understanding that operating under 
the highest standards for business behavior goes beyond goodwill and is intimately linked to 
performance and profitability,” he says.14
Sometimes taking an ethical stand can actually cost a firm in lost revenues and other 
support. When Google announced a reversal of its original stance on censorship in China—
essentially shutting down operations there and rerouting traffic to an uncensored site in 
Hong Kong—not only did the company lose business, it found itself standing eerily alone on 
the issue. Google’s decision and the consequences are discussed in the “Solving an Ethical 
Controversy” feature.
Importance of Planning
Turning a vision into reality takes planning. When Reid Hoffman first got the idea for 
the professional social network LinkedIn headquartered in Mountain View, California, he 
recalls that he was “very interested in this whole notion of each of us as individual profes-
sionals who are on the Internet and how that changes the way we do business, our careers, 
our brand identity. I realized that the world was transforming every individual into a small 
business.” As Hoffman developed the idea, he considered how a professional social network 
could be used, asking himself and other businesspeople questions that helped develop his ini-
tial plan. “How do you positively influence your brand on the Net? How do you assemble a 
team fast? Who has the expertise to guide you?” Answers to these questions and many more 
became the plan for LinkedIn.15

Types of Planning
Planning can be categorized by scope and breadth. Some plans are very broad and long 
range, while others are short range and very narrow, affecting selected parts of the organi-
zation rather than the whole thing. Planning can be divided into the following categories: 
strategic, tactical, operational, and contingency, with each step including more specific infor-
mation than the last. From the mission statement (described in the next section) to objectives 
to specific plans, each phase must fit into a comprehensive planning framework. The frame-
work also must include narrow, functional plans aimed at individual employees and work 
areas relevant to individual tasks. These plans must fit within the firm’s overall planning 
framework and help it reach objectives and achieve its mission.
Strategic Planning The most far-reaching level of planning is strategic 
planning—the process of determining the primary objectives of an organization and then 
acting and allocating resources to achieve those objectives. Generally, strategic planning is 
undertaken by top executives in a company. As part of its strategy of using company resources 
to raise environmental awareness—and develop or improve products—Staples sponsors its 
annual Staples Global EcoEasy Challenge, a competition in which college students develop 
new products or redesign existing ones in a way that represents an innovative approach to 
sustainability.16
Tactical Planning Tactical planning involves implementing the activities speci-
fied by strategic plans. Tactical plans guide the current and near-term activities required to 
implement overall strategies. The Staples Global EcoEasy Challenge is a tactic that reflects 
strategic planning around environmentally responsible products. Another tactic for the same 
strategy is Staples’ development of its EcoEasy and Sustainable Earth product lines. “Staples’ 
commitment to designing more environmentally responsible products as compared to con-
ventional products is evident by our own EcoEasy and Sustainable Earth brands,” notes 
Staples’ vice president of environmental 
affairs Mark Buckley.17
Operational Planning 
Operational planning creates the detailed 
standards that guide implementation 
of tactical plans. This activity involves 
choosing specific work targets and 
assigning employees and teams to carry 
out plans. Unlike strategic planning, 
which focuses on the organization as a 
whole, operational planning deals with 
developing and implementing tactics in 
specific functional areas. Operational 
planning related to the Staples EcoEasy 
Challenge might include identifying 
competition categories such as creating 
a product using eco-innovative materi-
als; selecting judges; setting deadlines; 
reviewing contestant applications; and 
the like.

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
Contingency Planning Planning cannot foresee every possibility. Major acci-
dents, natural disasters, and rapid economic downturns can throw even the best-laid plans 
into chaos. To handle the possibility of business disruption from events of this nature, many 
firms use contingency planning, which allows them to resume operations as quickly and as 
smoothly as possible after a crisis while openly communicating with the public about what 
happened. This planning activity involves two components: business continuation and public 
communication. Many firms have developed management strategies to speed recovery from 
accidents such as loss of data, breaches of security, product failures, and natural disasters 
such as floods or fire. If a major disaster or business disruption occurs, a company’s contin-
gency plan usually designates a chain of command for crisis management, assigning specific 
functions to particular managers and employees in an emergency. But crisis more often 
occurs on a less global scale. For example, a product delivery might go astray, a key person 
might be sick and unable to attend an important customer meeting, or the power might go 
out for a day. These instances require contingency planning as well. When British Airways 
cabin crews walked off their jobs, the airline was forced to cancel or delay hundreds of flights. 
This left many travelers stranded, rerouted, or struggling to find flights on different airlines. 
But by the second day of the strike, the airline claimed that due to successful contingency 
planning, many of its flights were reinstated. Anticipating the strike, BA had retrained some 
on-ground staffers to serve as cabin crew, and leased planes and crew from some of its com-
petitors. “Our contingency plans are continuing to work well . . . around the world,” stated an 
airline spokesperson.18
Planning at Different Organizational Levels
Although managers spend some time on planning virtually every day, the total time 
spent and the type of planning done differ according to the level of management. As 
Table 7.1 points out, top managers, including a firm’s board of directors and CEO, spend 
a great deal of time on long-range planning, while middle-level managers and supervisors 
focus on short-term, tactical and operational planning. Employees at all levels can benefit 
themselves and their company by making plans to meet their own specific goals.

The Strategic Planning Process
Strategic planning often makes the difference between an organization’s success and 
failure. Strategic planning has formed the basis of many fundamental management decisions. 
Successful strategic planners typically follow the six steps shown in Figure 7.2: defining a 
mission, assessing the organization’s competitive position, setting organizational objectives, 
creating strategies for competitive differentiation, implementing the strategy, and evaluating 
the results and refining the plan.
Defining the Organization’s Mission
The first step in strategic planning is to translate the firm’s vision into a mission 
statement. A mission statement is a written explanation of an organization’s business 
intentions and aims. It is an enduring statement of a firm’s purpose, possibly highlighting 
the scope of operations, the market it seeks to serve, and the ways it will attempt to set itself 
apart from competitors. A mission statement guides the actions of employees, and publicizes 
the company’s reasons for existence.
Mission statements can be short or long:
 
• Starbucks: “To inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup and one 
neighborhood at a time.”
 • Disney: “We create happiness by providing the finest in entertainment for people of all 
ages, everywhere.”
 • Nike: “To bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.”
 • Sony: “To experience the joy of advancing and applying technology for the benefit of 
the public.”

Johnson & Johnson: Caring for the World
In its company statement of values, Johnson & Johnson promises 
that “We must maintain in good order the property we are privileged 
to use, protecting the environment and natural resources.” That’s a 
simple statement, but a complex pledge to fulfill. Johnson & Johnson 
makes a wide range of consumer products such as Band-Aids, 
Listerine, and Johnson’s Baby Lotion. It also produces medical devices 
and prescription drugs. Doing so can result in a giant carbon foot-
print made by manufacturing emissions, chemicals in products and 
processes, and a tremendous use of energy. Yet Johnson & Johnson is 
committed to reaching its environmental goals and has put the man-
agement in place to do so.
The firm sets new long-term goals every five years, under its 
“Healthy Planet” program. Some of these have included using direct 
purchase of low-impact hydro and wind power, on-site solar power 
and landfill gas, and purchasing renewable energy certificates from 
wind power and biomass facilities. Johnson & Johnson believes these 
practices not only benefit the environment, but also the company 
because it provides the firm with reliable, affordable sources of 
energy. In addition, Johnson & Johnson operates the largest fleet of 
hybrid vehicles owned by a corporation in the world.
Part of the “Healthy Planet” program also involves being truthful 
about green advertising—avoiding so-called greenwashing. Company 
management believes in transparency—informing employees, suppliers, 
consumers, and shareholders of what’s green and what’s not. This 
also means being specific about sustainability measures. “Provide your 
consumers with real numbers that inform and empower them,” says 
the Web site. And while Johnson & Johnson refuses to overstate its 
accomplishments, the firm is beginning to publicize its efforts so that 
consumers can share in them. For example, the company is the second-
largest producer of solar panels in the United States, and was recently 
ranked number three on Newsweek’s Green Ranking List.
None of these goals could be achieved without support from 
Johnson & Johnson’s leadership. Chairman and CEO William Weldon 
is committed to his company’s sustainability initiatives as they relate 
to people and the planet. He writes, “More than ever, we know that 
caring for the health and well-being of people is not only an out-
standing business but a mission that truly touches lives.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What role does the CEO’s leadership play in accomplishing 
Johnson & Johnson’s green goals?
2. How does the company’s mission relate to sustainability?

A good mission statement states the firm’s purpose for being in business and its overall 
goal. The most effective mission statements are memorable as well. The “Going Green” 
feature describes the mission of Johnson & Johnson, a global manufacturer of pharmaceuti-
cals and healthcare products.
Assessing Your Competitive Position
Once a mission statement has been created, the next step in the planning process is to 
determine the firm’s current—or potential—position in the marketplace. The company’s 
founder or top managers evaluate the factors that may help it grow or could cause it to fail. 
A frequently used tool in this phase of strategic planning is the SWOT analysis. SWOT is 
an acronym for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. By systematically evaluating all 
four of these factors, a firm can then develop the best strategies for gaining a competitive 
advantage. The framework for a SWOT analysis appears in Figure 7.3.
To evaluate a firm’s strengths and weaknesses, its managers may examine each func-
tional area such as finance, marketing, information technology, and human resources. 
Or they might evaluate strengths and weaknesses of each office, plant, or store. 
Entrepreneurs may focus on the individual skills and experience they bring to a new 
business.

FIGURE
For Starbucks, a key strength is consumers’ positive image of the company’s brand, 
which gets them to stand in line to pay premium prices for coffee. That positive image 
comes from Starbucks’s being one of the best 100 companies to work for in the United 
States, according to Fortune, and from its socially responsible corporate policies. The 
company’s strategic plans have included various ways to build on Starbucks’s strong brand 
loyalty by attaching it to new products and expanding into new markets. The expansion 
efforts have included creating a Music WiFi Community on its Web site; offering bottled 
Frappuccino drinks in grocery stores; and opening thousands of Starbucks outlets in Europe, 
Asia, and the Middle East. Weaknesses include saturating some markets with too many 
stores and not paying attention to store design. Starbucks eventually addressed these weak-
nesses by closing some stores and redesigning others.19
SWOT analysis continues with an attempt to define the major opportunities and 
threats the firm is likely to face. Threats might include an economic recession—during 
which consumers are not willing to pay a premium for products—or a change in federal 
regulations. Starbucks addressed the threat of an economic downturn by beginning to offer 
less-expensive, instant coffee in stores like Costco and Target. Opportunities include such 
phenomena as the growth of social media. So Starbucks added links to Facebook and 
Twitter from its Web site.20
A SWOT analysis isn’t carved in stone. Strengths and weaknesses, like opportunities and 
threats, may shift over time. A strength may eventually become a weakness and a threat may 
turn into an opportunity. But the analysis gives managers a place to start.

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
Setting Objectives for the Organization
The next step in planning is to develop objectives for the firm. Objectives set guide-
posts by which managers define the organization’s desired performance in such areas as 
new-product development, sales, customer service, growth, environmental and social respon-
sibility, and employee satisfaction. While the mission statement identifies a company’s over-
all goals, objectives are more concrete.
One of Ford Motor Company’s objectives is to update the styling of its Taurus model. 
New Taurus features include a T-handle shifter and a built-in navigation system.21 One of 
Quiznos’ objectives is to reduce the eco-footprint of its packaging. Quiznos now serves its 
drinks in 100-percent compostable wax-coated paper cups, and its salad bowls are made from 
renewable sugarcane.22
Creating Strategies for Competitive Differentiation
Developing a mission statement and setting objectives point a business in a specific 
direction. But the firm needs to identify the strategies it will use to reach its destination 
ahead of the competition. The underlying goal of strategy development is competitive 
differentiation—the unique combination of a company’s abilities and resources that set it 
apart from its competitors. A firm might differentiate itself by being the first to introduce a 
product such as the iPad to a widespread market; or by offering exceptional customer service 
such as Nordstrom; or by offering bargains such as Costco. Pittsburgh-based PurBlu founder 
and CEO Ben Lewis differentiates his brand of bottled water, called Give Water, by market-
ing the fact that a portion of each bottle sold is donated to local charities. The firm’s line of 
energy drinks, Give Energy, generates funds for grassroots sustainability initiatives.23

Implementing the Strategy
Once the first four phases of the strategic planning process are complete, managers are 
ready to put those plans into action. Often, it’s the middle managers or supervisors who 
actually implement a strategy. But studies show that top company officials are still reluctant 
to empower these managers with the authority to make decisions that could benefit the com-
pany. Companies that are willing to empower employees generally reap the benefits.24
In an effort to accomplish the strategy of cutting costs, avoiding layoffs, and maintaining 
a high level of customer service, insurance and financial services giant USAA started cross-
training its call-center representatives. As a result, when customers place calls about cer-
tain issues, they don’t automatically have to be transferred to someone else. A call rep who 
answers investment queries can also answer questions about insurance. While this may seem 
an obvious solution—without much tangible effect—in fact, the cross-training has reduced 
the cost of running the call center, saved jobs, and increased customer satisfaction. Call reps 
are now more empowered to help customers directly, which also boosts employee morale.25
Monitoring and Adapting Strategic Plans
The final step in the strategic planning process is to monitor and adapt plans when 
the actual performance fails to meet goals. Monitoring involves securing feedback about 
performance. Managers might compare actual sales against forecasts; compile information 
from surveys; listen to complaints from the customer hot line; interview employees who 
are involved; and review reports prepared by production, finance, marketing, or other com-
pany units. If an Internet advertisement doesn’t result in enough response or sales, manag-
ers might evaluate whether to continue the advertisement, change it, or discontinue it. If a 
retailer observes customers buying more jeans when they are displayed near the front door, 
likely the display area will stay near the door—and perhaps be enlarged. Ongoing use of such 
tools as SWOT analysis and forecasting can help managers adapt their objectives and func-
tional plans as changes occur.
Managers as Decision Makers
Managers make decisions every day, whether it involves shutting down a manufacturing 
plant or adding grilled cheese sandwiches to a lunch menu. Decision making is the pro-
cess of recognizing a problem or opportunity, evaluating alternative solutions, selecting and 
implementing an alternative, and assessing the results. Managers make two basic kinds of 
decisions: programmed decisions and nonprogrammed decisions.
Programmed and Nonprogrammed Decisions
A programmed decision involves simple, common, and frequently occurring problems for 
which solutions have already been determined. Examples of programmed decisions include 
reordering office supplies, renewing a lease, and referring to an established discount for bulk 
orders. Programmed decisions are made in advance—the firm sets rules, policies, and proce-
dures for managers and employees to follow on a routine basis. Programmed decisions actu-
ally save managers time and companies money because new decisions don’t have to be made 
each time the situation arises.

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
A nonprogrammed decision involves a complex and unique problem or opportunity with 
important consequences for the organization. Examples of nonprogrammed decisions 
include entering a new market, deleting a product from the line, or developing a new prod-
uct. Apple’s decision to develop and launch its new product the iPad was a nonprogrammed 
decision that involved research and development, finances, technology, production, and mar-
keting. Decisions were made about everything from what kinds of apps and accessories the 
iPad would offer to how much the new device would cost consumers.26
How Managers Make Decisions
In a narrow sense, decision making involves choosing among two or more alterna-
tives, with the chosen alternative becoming the decision. In a broader sense, decision mak-
ing involves a systematic, step-by-step process that helps managers make effective choices. 
This process begins when someone recognizes a problem or opportunity, develops possible 
courses of action, evaluates the alternatives, selects and implements one of them, and assesses 
the outcome. It’s important to keep in mind that managers are human decision makers, and 
while they can follow the decision-making process as shown in Figure 7.4 step-by-step, the 
outcome of their decisions depends on many factors, including the accuracy of their infor-
mation and the experience, creativity, and wisdom of the person.
Making good decisions is never easy. A decision might hurt or help the sales of a prod-
uct; it might offend or disappoint a customer or coworker; it might affect the manager’s own 
career or reputation. Managers’ decisions can have complex legal and ethical dimensions.

citizenship is good behavior. The top ten corporate citizens named one recent year were: 
Hewlett-Packard, Intel, General Mills, IBM, Kimberly-Clark, Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-
Myers Squibb, The Coca-Cola Company, Gap Inc., and Hess Corporation.27
Managers as Leaders
A manager must demonstrate leadership, directing or inspiring people to attain certain 
goals. Great leaders do not all share the same qualities, but three traits are often mentioned: 
empathy (the ability to imagine yourself in someone else’s position), self-awareness, and 
objectivity. While it might seem as though empathy and objectivity are opposite traits, they 
do balance each other. Many leaders share other traits—courage, passion, commitment, 
innovation, and flexibility to name a few.
Leadership involves the use of influence or power. This influence may come from one 
or more sources. One source of power is the leader’s position in the company. A national 
sales manager has the authority to direct the activities of the sales force. Another source of 
power is a leader’s expertise and experience. A first-line 
supervisor with expert machinist skills will most likely be 
respected by employees in the machining department. 
Some leaders derive power from their personalities. 
Employees may admire a leader because they recognize 
an exceptionally kind and fair, humorous, energetic, or 
enthusiastic person. Admiration, inspiration, and motiva-
tion are especially important during difficult economic 
times or when a leader has to make tough decisions for 
the company. This has been true of Jeffrey Immelt, chair-
man and CEO of General Electric (GE), as described in 
the “Hit & Miss” feature.
When Doug Conant took over the CEO job at 
Campbell’s Soup nearly a decade ago, the company 
headquartered in Camden, New Jersey, was decidedly ho-
hum. Instead of boiling with innovation, the firm had left 
new ideas simmering on the back burner. Conant looked 
around his company, which produces one of the best-
known brands in the world, with frustration. “The

GE, once considered one of the nation’s most recognizable and 
respected firms, has fallen on hard times. The company, which manu-
factures everything from toasters to washing machines to jet engines, 
has been forced to pull the plug on various ventures in order to save 
itself. The man in charge of the power at GE is its CEO, Jeffrey Immelt.
Over the years, GE has grown into a conglomerate, straying far 
from its roots as a manufacturer of electrical appliances. Its GE Capital 
unit, which accounted for more than half of the company’s overall prof-
its, is now burdened with a huge number of bad loans. GE’s stake in 
NBC Universal and the NBC network will likely be sold to cable opera-
tor Comcast. But shareholders and others are asking, “Why was GE 
involved in these businesses in the first place?”
Jeffrey Immelt has vowed to change the direction of the company. 
“GE must be an industrial company first,” he notes. “We need a new strat-
egy for this economy. We should clear away any arrogance, false assump-
tions, or a sense that things will be OK just because we are [in] America.”
Financially, GE can’t just walk away from its GE Capital commitments. 
But Immelt has promised to reduce its size and renew the firm’s focus 
on its industrial roots, including a significant investment in clean energy 
projects. He takes his leadership role, as well as the leadership role of GE 
itself, very seriously. “We need to invest more in innovation. We need to 
target this innovation toward fulfilling big needs like clean energy,” he 
says. “Nothing of consequence is accomplished without leadership.”
Immelt observes that today’s leaders must adopt a democratic 
style that encourages input from employees. “Twenty-first century lead-
ers listen. They use external inputs as a catalyst. They put their ego 
in check. They ask more questions than they answer. They welcome 
dissent and debate, and are constantly seeking more intelligence.” 
Immelt has been spending his weekends listening to the 185 officers of 
GE—one at a time. The weekend sessions create personal connections 
with his team.
He also points out the importance of delegating in order to inno-
vate more easily and regain a competitive standing in the marketplace. 
“GE is a big organization. The problem with size is that it can be too 
slow. At GE, we must push decision-making down in the organization 
and we must delegate more.”
Immelt has demonstrated his commitment to GE, his employees, 
and the firm’s shareholders by declining his bonus two years in a row. 
This doesn’t mean he isn’t paid well—he still earns more than $5.5 
million per year. Immelt is determined to regain the respect for his 
firm that it once enjoyed. As a leader, he understands this cannot be 
accomplished without inspired employees. “Leaders must motivate with 
vision,” he observes. His vision includes a much brighter light for GE.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How would you characterize Immelt’s leadership style? Is 
it appropriate for a big organization like GE? Why or 
why not?
2. Do you think Immelt is an effective motivator? Would you 
want to work for him? Why or why not?

microwave was invented in 1947, but it took us until 2002 to put together a microwave-
able soup pack,” he pointed out to his researchers, marketers, and managers. So Conant got 
to work on updating the world’s largest soup company. He cut all products that were not 
number one or number two in their categories. He poured resources into developing prod-
ucts that shrieked value, nutrition, and convenience to consumers. And he engineered a new 
focus on two of the world’s largest soup-eating nations: China and Russia. Conant believes 
that action is the best demonstration of leadership. “You can’t talk your way out of some-
thing you behaved your way into,” he says.28
Leadership Styles
The way a person uses power to lead others determines his or her leadership 
style. Leadership styles range along a continuum with autocratic leadership at one 
extreme end and free-rein leadership at the other. Autocratic leadership is centered on the 
boss. Autocratic leaders make decisions on their own without consulting employees. 
They reach decisions, communicate them to subordinates, and expect automatic 
implementation.

Democratic leadership includes subordinates in the 
decision-making process. This leadership style cen-
ters on employees’ contributions. Democratic leaders 
delegate assignments, ask employees for suggestions, 
and encourage participation. An important outgrowth 
of democratic leadership in business is the concept of 
empowerment, in which employees share author-
ity, responsibility, and decision making with their 
managers.
At the other end of the continuum from auto-
cratic leadership is free-rein leadership. Free-rein 
leaders believe in minimal supervision. They allow 
subordinates to make most of their own decisions. 
Free-rein leaders communicate with employees 
frequently, as the situation warrants. For the first 
decade of its existence, Google was proud of its free-
rein leadership style. Engineers were encouraged to 
pursue any and all ideas; teams formed or disbanded 
on their own; employees spent as much or as little 
time as they wanted to on any given project. But as 
the firm entered its second decade, it became appar-
ent that not every innovation was worth pursuing—
and some valuable ideas were getting lost in the chaos. CEO Eric Schmidt noted, “We were 
concerned that some of the biggest ideas were getting squashed.” So the firm established a 
process for reviewing new project ideas in order to identify those most likely to succeed.29
Which Leadership Style Is Best?
No single leadership style is best for every firm in every situation. Sometimes leader-
ship styles require change in order for a company to grow, as has been the case for Google. 
In a crisis, an autocratic leadership style might save the company—and sometimes the lives 
of customers and employees. This was the case when US Airways flight 1549 was forced to 
ditch into the Hudson River after hitting a wayward flock of Canada geese. Quick, auto-
cratic decisions made by pilot Chesley Sullenberger resulted in the survival of everyone on 
board the flight. But US Airways management on the ground activated a democratic style 
of leadership in which managers at many levels were empowered to take actions to help the 
passengers and their families. For example, one executive arrived on the scene with a bag 
of emergency cash for passengers and credit cards for employees so they could purchase 
medicines, food, or anything else they needed.30 A company that recognizes which leader-
ship style works best for its employees, customers, and business conditions is most likely to 
choose the best leaders for its particular needs.
Corporate Culture
An organization’s corporate culture is its system of principles, beliefs, and values. The 
leadership style of its managers, the way it communicates, and the overall work environment 
influence a firm’s corporate culture. A corporate culture is typically shaped by the leaders 
who founded and developed the company and by those who have succeeded them. Although

Google has grown by leaps and bounds since its launch, the firm still tries to maintain the 
culture of innovation, creativity, and flexibility that its co-founders Larry Page and Sergey 
Brin promoted from the beginning. Google now has offices around the world, staffed by 
thousands of workers who speak a multitude of languages. “We are aggressively inclusive in 
our hiring, and we favor ability over experience,” states the Web site. “The result is a team 
that reflects the global audience Google serves. When not at work, Googlers pursue interests 
from cross-country cycling to wine tasting, from flying to Frisbee.”31
Managers use symbols, rituals, ceremonies, and stories to reinforce corporate culture. 
The corporate culture at the Walt Disney Company is almost as famous as the original 
Disney characters themselves. In fact, every Disney employee is known as a cast member. 
All new employees attend training seminars in which they learn the language, customs, 
traditions, stories, product lines—everything there is to know about the Disney culture and 
its original founder, Walt Disney.32
Corporate cultures can be very strong and enduring, but sometimes they are forced to 
change to meet new demands in the business environment. A firm that is steeped in tradition 
and bureaucracy might have to shift to a leaner, more flexible culture in order to respond 
to shifts in technology or customer preferences. A firm that grows quickly—like Google—
generally has to make some adjustments in its culture to accommodate more customers and 
employees.
In an organization with a strong culture, everyone knows and supports the same prin-
ciples, beliefs, and values, as is the case at Southwest Airlines, described in the “Hit & Miss” 
feature. To achieve its goals, a business must also provide structure, which results from the 
management function of organizing.
Organizational Structures
An organization is a structured group of people working together to achieve common 
goals. An organization features three key elements: human interaction, goal-directed activi-
ties, and structure. The organizing process, much of which is led by managers, should result 
in an overall structure that permits interactions among individuals and departments needed 
to achieve company goals.
The steps involved in the organizing process are shown in Figure 7.5. Managers first 
determine the specific activities needed to implement plans and achieve goals. Next, they

Southwest Airlines is well known for its reasonable fares, cheerful 
service, convenient schedules, and a genuine interest in its passengers. 
When other airlines started charging customers for checked baggage, 
Southwest flatly refused to get on board. Instead, the airline stood firm 
against this kind of additional charge, poking fun at it with an advertis-
ing campaign whose tagline was, “We Love Your Bags.” Customers just 
love Southwest for decisions like this.
Southwest has a corporate culture filled with humor and energy 
that spills over to its customers, begun with its founder Herb Kelleher. 
“Southwest Airlines has built its culture and its reputation from the 
inside out,” says the company Web site. The idea is that if the 
company’s 32,000 employees are happy, they will be motivated to 
ensure their customers’ happiness as well. This simple strategy has 
been very effective. “Southwest likes to think of itself as a customer 
service organization that happens to fly airplanes,” explains president 
Colleen Barrett.
One of the characteristics that Southwest looks for in potential 
employees is a “servant’s heart.” When considering a pool of flight-
attendant candidates, Southwest managers conduct group interviews 
to see how the candidates interact with one another—generally it is a 
good indicator of how they will react to customers. Believing that 
strong relationships within the company is important to the firm’s 
long-term success, Southwest gives employees every opportunity to 
voice their opinions, receive education and training, and move up the 
career ladder.
Southwest empowers its middle managers, supervisors, and front-
line employees with the authority to make decisions that strengthen 
relationships with customers. “In the airline industry, a company is only 
as good as its customers’ last travel experience,” notes Ginger Hardage, 
Southwest’s senior vice president for corporate communication. “At 
Southwest, employees are encouraged to make decisions from the 
heart, and in turn, these proactive gestures provide positive benefits to 
the customers and the company.”
Although a strong corporate culture is clearly part of an overall 
strategy, at Southwest it is more than that—frequently employees and 
passengers refer to Southwest as a company with “heart.” That heart 
originated with Southwest’s founder and long-time CEO Herb Kelleher, 
who is known for his love of fun. Even after Kelleher stepped down 
from the CEO position, the company runs on his spirit. Current CEO 
Gary Kelly observes that Southwest strives to keep its culture “support-
ive, active, and fun.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How would you describe the principles, beliefs, and values 
at Southwest?
2. Herb Kelleher is no longer CEO of Southwest, yet the 
company’s original corporate culture seems to have sur-
vived. Why do you think this is?

group these work activities into a logical structure. Then they assign work to specific 
employees and give the people the resources they need to complete it. Managers coordinate 
the work of different groups and employees within the firm. Finally, they evaluate the results 
of the organizing process to ensure effective and efficient progress toward planned goals. 
Evaluation sometimes results in changes to the way work is organized.
Many factors influence the results of organizing. The list includes a firm’s goals and 
competitive strategy, the type of product it offers, the way it uses technology to accom-
plish work, and its size. Small firms typically create very simple structures. The owner of a 
dry-cleaning business generally is the top manager, who hires several employees to process 
orders, clean the clothing, and make deliveries. The owner handles the functions of purchas-
ing supplies such as detergents and hangers, hiring and training employees and coordinat-
ing their work, preparing advertisements for the local newspaper, and keeping accounting 
records.
As a company grows, its structure increases in complexity. With increased size comes 
specialization and growing numbers of employees. A larger firm may employ many

salespeople, along with a sales manager to direct and coordinate their work, or organize an 
accounting department.
An effective structure is one that is clear and easy to understand: employees know what 
is expected of them and to whom they report. They also know how their jobs contribute to 
the company’s mission and overall strategic plan. An organization chart can help clarify the 
structure of a firm. Figure 7.6 illustrates a sample organization chart.
Not-for-profit organizations also organize through formal structures so they can func-
tion efficiently and carry out their goals. These organizations, such as the Salvation Army 
and the American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), sometimes have a 
blend of paid staff and volunteers in their organizational structure.
Departmentalization
Departmentalization is the process of dividing work activities into units within the 
organization. In this arrangement, employees specialize in certain jobs—such as market-
ing, finance, or design. Depending on the size of the firm, usually an executive runs the 
department, followed by middle-level managers and supervisors. The five major forms of 
departmentalization subdivide work by product, geographical area, customer, function, and 
process.
 
• Product departmentalization. This approach organizes work units based on the goods 
and services a company offers. California’s Activision Blizzard Inc. recently 
restructured its organization by product. The videogame publisher is now divided 
into four divisions: “Call of Duty,” a military game; internally owned games such as

 • Geographical departmentalization. This form organizes units by geographical regions 
within a country or, for a multinational firm, by region throughout the world. Enterprise 
Rent-A-Car, based in St. Louis, is organized by geography, staffing 7,000 rental loca-
tions in the United States, Canada, Germany, Ireland, and England.34
 • Customer departmentalization. A firm that offers a variety of goods and services targeted 
at different types of customers might structure itself based on customer departmentaliza-
tion. Management of Minnesota-based 3M’s wide array of products is divided 
among six business units: consumer and office; display and graphics; electro and 
communications; healthcare; industrial and transportation; and safety, security, and 
protection services.35
 • Functional departmentalization. Some firms organize work units according to business 
functions such as finance, marketing, human resources, and production. An advertising 
agency may create departments for creative personnel (say, copywriters), media buyers, 
and account executives.
 • Process departmentalization. Some goods and services require multiple work processes to 
complete their production. A manufacturer may set up separate departments for cutting 
material, heat-treating it, forming it into its final shape, and painting it.
As Figure 7.7 illustrates, a single company may implement several different departmen-
talization schemes. In deciding on a form of departmentalization, managers take into account 
the type of product they produce, the size of their company, their customer base, and the 
locations of their customers.

cons of each type of

Delegating Work Assignments
Managers assign work to employees, a process called delegation. Employees might be 
responsible for answering customer calls, scooping ice cream, processing returns, making 
deliveries, opening or closing a store, cooking or serving food, contributing to new-product 
design, calculating a return on investment, or any of thousands of other tasks. Just as impor-
tant, employees are given a certain amount of authority to make decisions.
Companies like Zappos, the online shoe retailer, that empower their workers to make 
decisions that could better serve their customers generally have happier employees and more 
satisfied customers.36 As employees receive greater authority, they also must be account-
able for their actions and decisions—they receive credit when things go well, and must 
accept responsibility when they don’t. Managers also must figure out the best way to del-
egate responsibilities to employees who belong to different age groups, as discussed in the 
“Business Etiquette” feature.
Span of Management The span of management, or span of control, is the num-
ber of employees a manager supervises. These employees are often referred to as direct 
reports. First-line managers have wider spans of management, monitoring the work of many 
employees. The span of management varies depending on many factors, including the type 
of work performed and employees’ training. In recent years, a growing trend has brought 
wider spans of control, as companies have reduced their layers of management to flatten 
their organizational structures, in the process increasing the decision-making responsibility 
they give employees.

that emphasizes decentralization locates decision 
making at lower levels. A trend toward decentral-
ization has pushed decision making down to oper-
ating employees in many cases. Firms that have 
decentralized believe that the change can improve 
their ability to serve customers. For example, the 
front desk clerk at a hotel is much better equipped 
to fulfill a guest’s request for a crib or a wake-up 
call than the hotel’s general manager.
Types of Organization 
Structures
The four basic types of organization structures 
are line, line-and-staff, committee, and matrix. 
While some companies do follow one type of 
structure, most use a combination.
Line Organizations A line organization, 
the oldest and simplest organization structure, 
establishes a direct flow of authority from the chief 
executive to employees. The line organization 
defines a simple, clear chain of command—a hierar-
chy of managers and workers. With a clear chain 
of command, everyone knows who is in charge and 
decisions can be made quickly. This structure is 
particularly effective in a crisis situation. But a line 
organization has its drawbacks. Each manager has 
complete responsibility for a range of activities; in 
a medium-sized or large organization, however, 
this person can’t possibly be expert in all of them. 
In a small organization such as a local hair salon, 
or dentist’s office, a line organization is probably 
the most efficient way to run the business.
Line-and-Staff Organizations A 
line-and-staff organization combines the direct 
flow of authority of a line organization with staff 
departments that support the line departments. 
Line departments participate directly in decisions 
that affect the core operations of the organiza-
tion. Staff departments lend specialized techni-
cal support. Figure 7.8 illustrates a line-and-staff 
organization. Accounting, engineering, and human 
resources are staff departments that support the 
line authority extending from the plant manager 
to the production manager and supervisors.
LECTURE ENHANCER: 
Why do you think this 
structure might be the 
most effective structure in 
a crisis?
Managing a Multigenerational Workforce
Today’s ﬁ rms are comprised of employees spanning a wide range of ages. 
Though management experts warn against stereotyping, they do suggest 
making an effort to understand each group and taking steps to open commu-
nication so that the workforce functions well together. Baby Boomers, those 
workers born between 1946 and 1964, tend to be competitive and believe 
younger employees should work their way up the company ladder. Gen Xers, 
born between 1965 and 1977, are more skeptical, independent thinkers. 
Gen Ys—also called the Millenials—were born in 1978 or later and prefer 
teamwork, feedback, and technology.
Managers can more effectively delegate work to employees in these groups 
by doing the following:
 • Offering—and nurturing—mentoring between younger and older 
employees. Cross-generational communication and support facilitates 
understanding.
 • Recognizing and accommodating different learning—and work—styles.
 • Engaging employees through training, education, and career develop-
ment opportunities.
 • Discarding rigid routines for those who work best without them.
 • Using different forms of communication. Older employees may prefer 
chatting on the phone or in person. Millenials might do best with e-mails, 
text messages, or via social networking.
 • Giving everyone an equal voice. Everyone wants to be heard and under-
stood. Offer opportunities for all employees to voice their opinions.

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
A line manager and a staff manager differ signifi-
cantly in their authority relationships. A line manager 
forms part of the primary line of authority that flows 
throughout the organization. Line managers interact 
directly with the functions of production, financing, or 
marketing—the functions needed to produce and sell 
goods and services. A staff manager provides informa-
tion, advice, or technical assistance to aid line manag-
ers. Staff managers do not have authority to give orders 
outside their own departments or to compel line man-
agers to take action.
The line-and-staff organization is common in 
midsize and large organizations. It is an effective 
structure because it combines the line organization’s 
capabilities for rapid decision making and direct 
communication with the expert knowledge of staff 
specialists.
Committee Organizations A 
committee organization is a structure that places 
authority and responsibility jointly in the hands of a 
group of individuals rather than a single manager. 
This model typically appears as part of a regular line-
and-staff structure.
Committees also work in areas such as new-product development. A new-product com-
mittee may include managers from such areas as accounting, engineering, finance, manu-
facturing, marketing, and technical research. By including representatives from all areas 
involved in creating and marketing products, such a committee generally improves planning 
and employee morale because decisions reflect diverse perspectives.
Committees tend to act slowly and conservatively, however, and may make decisions by 
compromising conflicting interests rather than by choosing the best alternative. The defini-
tion of a camel as “a racehorse designed by committee” provides an apt description of some 
limitations of committee decisions. At Nordstrom, the six-person office of the co-presidency 
was eventually abandoned for a more traditional structure.
Matrix Organizations Some organizations use a matrix or product 
management design to customize their structures. The matrix structure links employees 
from different parts of the organization to work together on specific projects. Figure 7.9 
diagrams a matrix structure. A project manager assembles a group of employees from 
different functional areas. The employees keep their ties to the line-and-staff structure, 
as shown in the vertical white lines. As the horizontal gold lines show, employees are also 
members of project teams. When the project is completed, employees return to their 
“regular” jobs.
In the matrix structure, each employee reports to two managers: one line manager 
and one project manager. Employees who are chosen to work on a special project receive 
instructions from the project manager (horizontal authority), but they continue as employees 
in their permanent functional departments (vertical authority). The term matrix comes from 
the intersecting grid of horizontal and vertical lines of authority.

The matrix structure is popular at high-technology and multinational corporations, as 
well as hospitals and consulting firms. Dow Chemical and Procter & Gamble have both 
used matrix structures. The major benefits of the matrix structure come from its flexibility in 
adapting quickly to rapid changes in the environment and its capability of focusing resources 
on major problems or products. It also provides an outlet for employees’ creativity and ini-
tiative. However, it challenges project managers to integrate the skills of specialists from 
many departments into a coordinated team. It also means that team members’ permanent 
functional managers must adjust their employees’ regular workloads.
The matrix structure is most effective when company leaders empower project managers 
to use whatever resources are available to achieve the project’s objectives. Good project man-
agers know how to make the project goals clear and keep team members focused. A firm that 
truly embraces the matrix structure also nurtures a project culture by making sure staffing is 
adequate, the workload is reasonable, and other company resources are available to project 
managers.37

What’s Ahead
In the next chapter, we sharpen our focus on the importance of people—the human 
resource—in shaping the growth and profitability of the organization. We examine how 
firms recruit, select, train, evaluate, and compensate employees in their attempts to attract, 
retain, and motivate a high-quality workforce. The concept of motivation is examined, and 
we will discuss how managers apply theories of motivation in the modern workplace. The 
next chapter also looks at the important topic of labor–management relations.
Summary of Learning Objectives
Define management and the three types of skills necessary 
for managerial success.
Management is the process of achieving organizational 
objectives through people and other resources. The manage-
ment hierarchy is generally as follows: top managers provide 
overall direction for company activities, middle managers 
implement the strategies of top managers and direct the 
activities of supervisors, and supervisors interact directly 
with workers. The three basic managerial skills are: techni-
cal, human or interpersonal, and conceptual.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 What is management? Management is the process 
of achieving organizational objectives through people and 
other resources. The manager’s job is to combine human 
and technical resources in the best way possible to achieve 
the company’s goals.
1.2 How do the jobs of top managers, middle managers, 
and supervisory managers differ? Top managers develop 
long-range plans, set a direction for their organization, 
and inspire all employees to achieve the company’s vision. 
Middle managers focus on specific operations, products, 
or customers. They develop procedures to implement the 
firm’s strategic plans. Supervisory managers interact directly 
with nonmanagerial employees who produce and sell the 
firm’s goods and services. They are responsible for imple-
menting the plans developed by middle managers and moti-
vating workers to accomplish immediate goals.
1.3 What is the relationship between the manager’s 
planning and controlling functions? Controlling is evalu-
ating an organization’s performance to determine whether 
it is accomplishing its objectives. The basic purpose of 
controlling is to assess the success of the planning function. 
Controlling also provides feedback for future rounds of 
planning.
Explain the role of vision and ethical standards in business 
success.
Vision is the founder’s perception of the marketplace needs 
and the firm’s methods for meeting them. Vision helps clar-
ify a firm’s purpose and the actions it can take to make the 
most of opportunities. High ethical standards can help build 
success for a firm through job satisfaction and customer 
loyalty.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 What is meant by a vision for the firm? A vision 
serves as the target for a firm’s actions, helping direct the 
company toward opportunities and differentiating it from its 
competitors.
2.2 Why is it important for a top executive to set 
high ethical standards? High ethical standards often result 
in a stable workforce, job satisfaction, and customer 
loyalty.
Summarize the major benefits of planning, and distinguish 
among strategic planning, tactical planning, and opera-
tional planning.
The planning process identifies organizational goals and 
develops the actions necessary to reach them. Planning 
helps a company turn vision into action, take advantage of 
opportunities, and avoid costly mistakes. Strategic planning 
is a far-reaching process. It views the world through a wide-
angle lens to determine the long-range focus and activities 
of the organization. Tactical planning focuses on the current 
and short-range activities required to implement the

organization’s strategies. Operational planning sets standards 
and work targets for functional areas such as production, 
human resources, and marketing.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 Outline the planning process. Some plans are very 
broad and long range, focusing on key organizational objec-
tives; others are more detailed and specify how particular 
objectives will be achieved. From the mission statement to 
objectives to specific plans, each phase must fit into a com-
prehensive planning framework.
3.2 Describe the purpose of tactical planning. The pur-
pose of tactical planning is to determine which short-term 
activities should be implemented to accomplish the firm’s 
overall strategy.
3.3 Compare the kinds of plans made by top managers 
and middle managers. How does their focus differ? Top 
managers focus on long-range, strategic plans. In contrast, 
middle-level managers and supervisors focus on short-term, 
tactical planning.
Describe the strategic planning process.
The first step of strategic planning is to translate the firm’s 
vision into a mission statement that explains its overall 
intentions and aims. Next, planners must assess the firm’s 
current competitive position using tools such as SWOT 
analysis. Managers then set specific objectives. The next 
step is to develop strategies for reaching objectives that will 
differentiate the firm from its competitors. Managers then 
develop an action plan that outlines the specific methods for 
implementing the strategy. Finally, the results achieved by 
the plan are evaluated, and the plan is adjusted as needed.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 What is the purpose of a mission statement? A mis-
sion statement is a public declaration of a firm’s purpose, the 
reason it exists, the customers it will serve, and the way it is 
different from competitors. A mission statement guides the 
actions of company managers and employees.
4.2 Which of the firm’s characteristics does a SWOT 
analysis compare? A SWOT analysis determines a firm’s 
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats relative to 
its competitors. A SWOT analysis helps determine a firm’s 
competitive position in the marketplace.
4.3 How do managers use objectives? Objectives, which 
are derived from the firm’s mission statement, are used to 
define desired performance levels in areas such as profitabil-
ity, customer service, and employee satisfaction.
Contrast the two major types of business decisions, and 
list the steps in the decision-making process.
A programmed decision applies a company rule or policy to 
solve a frequently occurring problem. A nonprogrammed 
decision forms a response to a complex and unique prob-
lem with important consequences for the organization. The 
five-step approach to decision making includes recognizing 
a problem or opportunity, developing alternative courses of 
action, evaluating the alternatives, selecting and implement-
ing an alternative, and following up the decision to deter-
mine its effectiveness.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 Distinguish between programmed and nonpro-
grammed decisions. Programmed decisions, such as 
reordering office supplies, are simple and happen fre-
quently, so procedures for these can streamline the process. 
Nonprogrammed decisions, such as the purchase of real 
estate or equipment, require more individual evaluation.
5.2 What are the steps in the decision-making process? 
The decision-making steps are recognition of a problem 
or opportunity, development of alternatives, evaluation of 
alternatives, selection and implementation of the chosen 
alternative, and follow-up to determine effectiveness of the 
decision.
Define leadership, and compare different leadership 
styles.
Leadership is the act of motivating others to achieve certain 
goals. The basic leadership styles are autocratic, demo-
cratic, and free-rein leadership. The best leadership style 
depends on three elements: the leader, the followers, and the 
situation.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 How is leadership defined? Leadership means directing 
or inspiring people to attain organizational goals. Effective 
leaders share several traits, such as empathy, self-awareness, 
and objectivity in dealing with others. Leaders also use the 
power of their jobs, expertise, and experience to influence 
others.
6.2 Identify the styles of leadership as they appear along 
a continuum of greater or lesser employee participa-
tion. At one end of the continuum, autocratic leaders make 
decisions without consulting employees. In the middle of the 
continuum, democratic leaders ask employees for sugges-
tions and encourage participation. At the other end of the 
continuum, free-rein leaders leave most decisions to their 
employees.
Discuss the meaning and importance of corporate culture.
Corporate culture refers to an organization’s principles, 
beliefs, and values. It is typically shaped by a firm’s founder 
and perpetuated through formal programs such as training, 
rituals, and ceremonies, as well as through informal discus-
sions among employees. Corporate culture can influence a 
firm’s success by giving it a competitive advantage.

Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 What is the relationship between leadership style 
and corporate culture? The best leadership style to adopt 
often depends on the organization’s corporate culture and its 
system of principles, beliefs, and values. Managerial philoso-
phies, communications networks, and workplace environ-
ments and practices all influence corporate culture.
7.2 What is a strong corporate culture? A corporate cul-
ture is an organization’s system of principles, beliefs, and 
values. In an organization with a strong culture, everyone 
knows and supports the same principles, beliefs, and values.
Identify the five major forms of departmentalization and 
the four main types of organization structures.
The subdivision of work activities into units within the 
organization is called departmentalization. It may be based on 
products, geographical locations, customers, functions, or 
processes. Most firms implement one or more of four struc-
tures: line, line-and-staff, committee, and matrix structures.
Assessment Check Answers 
8.1 What is the purpose of an organization 
chart? An organization chart is a visual representation 
of a firm’s structure that illustrates job positions and 
functions.
8.2 What are the five major forms of departmentaliza-
tion? Product departmentalization organizes units by the 
different goods and services a company offers. Geographical 
departmentalization organizes units by geographical 
regions. Customer departmentalization organizes units by 
different types of customers. Functional departmentaliza-
tion organizes units by business functions such as finance, 
marketing, human resources, and production. Process 
departmentalization organizes units by the steps or work 
processes it takes to complete production or provide a 
service.
8.3 What does span of management mean? The span of 
management, or span of control, is the number of employees 
a manager supervises.

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
Recently, when the other major U.S. automakers 
accepted federal funds in order to stay in business, Ford 
Motor Company—in the voice of CEO Alan R. Mulally—
said no. The federal funds were to come in the form of 
short-term loans, which Ford determined that it didn’t 
need at the time to survive. Several years earlier, the firm 
had faced financial decisions and restructured its debt in 
such a way that, when the economy slowed down, Ford 
didn’t.
Mulally observes that this timing was a bit of luck 
and a bit of strategic planning. “I go back to the funda-
mental point of view that the Ford Motor Company has 
taken about the future going forward, and the actions 
that we have taken to create that future,” he observes. 
“[Several years] ago we decided that fuel efficiency was 
going to be very, very important going forward, along with 
quality and safety and good value. We also decided that 
we wanted to provide customers with an absolutely clear 
vision of Ford and focus on the Ford brand.” As part of 
this overall strategy, Ford sold off its luxury brands Aston 
Martin, Jaguar, and Land Rover. Meanwhile, it invested in 
the development of moderately priced, fuel-efficient cars 
and trucks. Ford took on some extra debt at the time as 
a hedge against a recession—and had the cash on hand 
when the other two automakers didn’t.
Decisions like this are typical of the responsibilities 
that are faced by top managers like Mulally. They require 
strong leadership qualities that include a willingness to 
persist during tough times. But Mulally wasn’t always 
CEO of Ford. His first management position was as an 
engineering supervisor at Boeing. He overmanaged his 
employees so closely that one engineer finally quit. Mulally 
says that this was an important experience early in his 
management career. He realized that his job as a manager 
was “to help connect people to a bigger goal, a bigger 
program and help them move forward to even bigger 
contributions. That experience stayed with me forever on 
what it really means to manage and lead.”
Mulally believes that every employee has something 
to offer an organization and that each worker must be 
clear about the firm’s mission. “I think the most important 
thing is coming to a shared view about what we’re trying 
to accomplish,” he says. “What are we? What is our real 
purpose? And then, how do you include everybody so you 
know where you are on that plan?”
As the company’s leader, Mulally says that his job is 
to focus on four things: (1) the process of connecting his 
firm to the outside world, (2) keeping track of the firm’s 
identity in the marketplace, (3) balancing short-term objec-
tives with long-term goals, and (4) the values and stan-
dards of the organization. Mulally notes that keeping his 
eye on these four variables keeps Ford on the road. “I’m 
the one who needs to focus on those four things, because 
if I do that, the entire team will have a collective point 
of view and an understanding of all four of these areas.” 
When asked what career advice he would give to young 
recruits to the business world, Mulally answers without 
hesitation: “Don’t manage your career. Follow your dream 
and contribute.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How does Alan Mulally’s “focus on four things” 
help him with strategic planning for Ford? Do 
you believe it made a difference in the firm’s 
decision to decline the federal loan?
2. Mulally emphasizes the importance of having 
every employee understand the firm’s mission. 
How might this understanding help employees 
contribute to the company’s performance?

Case 7.2
Military Leaders in Business
It might seem like an odd match at first: military offi-
cers as business managers. But a number of firms, including 
retail giant Walmart, are discovering the benefits of military 
leadership as part of their management team. Recently 
Walmart faced a management problem: not enough junior 
managers in training. So Bill Simon, President and CEO 
of Walmart U.S. presented an idea: begin hiring junior 
military officers as management candidates. Simon, him-
self a 25-year veteran of the Navy and Naval Reserves 
thought the strategy made perfect sense. Walmart’s human 
resources department set out to implement the plan. “The 
thinking was that we could bring in world-class leadership 
talent that was already trained and ready to go,” explains 
Jennifer Seidner, a senior recruiting manager. “and then we 
could teach them retail, because we know that pretty well.”
Within a few months, Walmart realized it was min-
ing a huge vein of golden talent. The retailer hired retired 
Army brigadier general Gary Profit to expand military 
recruiting throughout the business. Now, recruiting from 
the military is standard procedure. “It’s been a fairly dra-
matic change,” observes Jennifer Seidner. The benefit to 
veterans is also dramatic. For the first time since World 
War II, veterans returning from combat are welcomed by 
businesses who want to hire them.
One project manager for GE Oil & Gas is a former 
Army captain. He manages a team of 50 people as they 
build a structure—they are ahead of schedule and under 
budget. When asked what his role is on the project, the 
manager says without hesitation, “leader, absolutely. To 
get the pieces where they need to be at the right time 
takes someone out there motivating, directing, organizing. 
It takes a leader to do it.”
Bill Simon’s initial idea has caught and spread like 
wildfire throughout the business world. Firms such as 
Home Depot, Lowe’s, State Farm Insurance, AT&T, Bank 
of America, and Merck all now routinely hire veterans 
as managers. In fact, companies actually compete with 
each other to locate and tap the best of the talent. Noel 
Tichy, director of the Global Business Partnership at the 
University of Michigan observes, “There’s a big pool 
of these officers who have had the kind of under-fire 
judgment experience that makes them really valuable. 
Whoever has the best screening and development is going 
to get some great leaders.” Larry Siegel, senior vice presi-
dent for the headhunting firm RecruitMilitary, agrees. “It’s 
sort of blood in the water,” he quips. “Companies really 
want these folks.”
Managers don’t necessarily arrive fully formed from 
the military. Often these job candidates lack certain tech-
nical skills such as budgeting. So, business schools have 
begun to attract these students—and MBA programs 
are happy to enroll them. In all, it’s a positive outcome 
for everyone. Many of tomorrow’s business leaders are 
already training—sometimes halfway around the world, in 
a tank or a tent.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What kind of leadership style are military 
recruits most likely to adopt? Why? Do 
you think this could ever become a 
problem?
2. How might planning in the military translate 
itself to planning in the business world?

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
Dan Formosa:  At the Forefront of Smart Design
CASE 1.3
Case 7.3
Like many new businesses, Smart Design was 
founded by a collection of college classmates who wanted 
to change something. Dan Formosa, along with several 
college friends, had a background in design and ergo-
nomics. The group believed that design should be about 
people, not things—and Smart Design was born. In the 
beginning, it was a hard sell—not the designs themselves, 
but the idea that the needs of individual people should 
be involved in the development of design. Formosa was 
interested in “how design can affect our quality of life, 
improve performance, and affect behavior.” The original 
Smart Design team “pulled together techniques in biome-
chanics and cognitive psychology,” recalls Formosa. “This 
was a type of an approach that no other design group was 
undertaking in the U.S. at the time, so it was an early test 
of our beliefs about what and where design should be.” 
Smart Design was successful throughout the 1980s, but 
Formosa admits that it was an uphill battle to convince 
clients that design was, indeed, for everyone.
Then came OXO. Around 1990, Smart Design 
acquired the manufacturing firm OXO as a client, giving 
Formosa’s team a chance to re-invent the design of com-
mon household products ranging from can openers to 
scissors, resulting in the OXO Good Grips line of kitchen 
utensils. Because of the mundane nature of these 
products—consumers weren’t accustomed to shopping 
for a potato peeler that actually felt comfortable in the 
hand—once they caught on, the idea that everyday 
design matters began to take hold in the marketplace. 
Smart Design’s client base grew significantly, as did the 
company. Firms such as Ford, ESPN, Samsung, Nike, and 
Microsoft began to request Smart Design’s services, and 
the number of employees increased.
No matter how much talent lies in the firm, though, 
managing a company of designers can be like trying to 
herd cats. Everyone has an idea, and everyone is running 
headlong in a different direction. So leadership is critical 
to the firm’s success. Paulette Bluhm-Sauriol, director of 
brand communication, observes that while most design-
ers are detail oriented, “Someone has to make sure that 
the team is keeping the big picture in mind, not just the 
details.” That’s part of her job as well as Formosa’s: 
maintaining the overall vision.  She also notes that, as a 
leader, Formosa has the natural gift of connecting and 
empathizing with people, whether it is employees or 
potential end-users of Smart Design’s products. “Dan has 
the ability to make going into people’s lives and becoming 
part of their lives comfortable,” she observes.
This was particularly true during the development of 
a new type of pre-filled medical syringe that Smart Design 
undertook for UCB/OXO Cimzia. The medication Cimzia 
is a solution that alleviates chronic pain in patients with 
certain conditions. If patients could administer the solution 
themselves in a comfortable way, it would enhance 
their lives. When the pharmaceutical maker UCB and 
OXO partnered to develop the new product, they went 
to Smart Design for the design. Formosa asked his team to 
go straight to the patients themselves to ask them what 
they needed. Designers met and observed patients in their 
own environment, giving them a chance to express their 
wishes. “It can be uncomfortable, but it’s amazing how 
you can get to the big ideas by approaching the project his 
way,” says Paulette Bluhm-Sauriol.
The syringe has met with marketplace success, and 
has even won an International Design Excellence Award. 
Most important, patients are getting what they need, 
which is exactly what Formosa strives for in each product 
his firm designs. “If someone buys a product or signs 
up for a service, they expect it to work. If you actually 
encounter a product or service that exceeds expectations, 
that is the sign of a great design,” he says. Formosa also 
contends that the same principles can be applied to the 
design of a delicate hospital instrument as are applied to a 
pizza cutter. “Since our focus is designing for people, then 
that is the common ground,” he asserts.
At Smart Design, the corporate culture supports the 
notion that the ideas of every employee are important. 
Regardless of job title, each person is considered a 
designer, with something valuable to contribute to the 
process. Formosa doesn’t mind the potential chaos of this 
kind of organization—it’s how he operates. “When we 
have everybody thinking everything, it’s a positive sign,” 
he says. It’s a formula that works.

Human Resource Management: 
From Recruitment to Labor 
Relations
Fancy/Alamy

 P rofessional childcare is a complicated 
business. With so many parents in the workplace, 
many employers find themselves in the position of 
helping their employees find the right care for their 
children while they are working. This might come 
in the form of giving credits or financial assistance 
toward daycare; or a firm might be large enough to 
establish on-site daycare to fulfill the needs of its 
families. Taking steps to ensure that the children of 
employees have appropriate care isn’t just the right 
thing to do—it’s good business. If an employee feels 
secure about where his or her children are and what 
they’re doing, the employee is much more likely to 
be motivated to focus on the job, perform well, and 
take less time off for child-care needs.
That’s where companies like Children’s Creative 
Learning Centers Inc. (CCLC) come in. CCLC, which 
was founded nearly two decades ago, operates more 
than 112 employee-sponsored daycare and learning 
centers around the country. CCLC offers care and 
learning programs for children ranging from age 
6 weeks to age 12 years at on-site or near-site child 
development centers. This includes daycare, before- 
and after-school programs, summer day camps, and 
even “back-up” or emergency daycare for children 
whose regular care is with another provider. CCLC 
centers operate with low teacher–child ratios, so 
each child gets individual attention—whether 
it’s on the playground, in the arts and crafts studio, 
or at a desk.
Offering top-notch childcare is only half of CCLC’s 
mission. Making sure its employees—the childcare 
providers themselves—are motivated and satisfied 
with their jobs is the other half. Providing job 
security and adequate benefits is difficult for many 
firms when the economy takes a dip. But CCLC 
accepts this challenge, believing that doing so will 
ensure success in the long run. CCLC’s 3,000 hourly 
workers are offered health insurance, company-
matching 401(k)s, paid vacation and sick days, 
childcare tuition assistance, and flexible spending 
accounts—just as salaried employees are. CCLC 
also offers its employees professional development 
opportunities and tuition reimbursement for 
continuing education. CCLC is also noted for its 
dual career track, which offers comparable pay 
and education opportunities for excellent teachers 
who have no interest in pursuing management 
careers. These measures have resulted in nationwide 
recognition. CCLC was recently named to Working 
Mother’s list of Best Companies for Hourly Workers. 
“Particularly in this era of severe cost-cutting 
measures, companies tend to overlook the long-
term value of family-friendly benefits, but we find 
these programs increase productivity and decrease 
turnover at all levels,” notes Carol Evans, president 
of Working Mother Media.
CCLC remains committed to supporting an 
enthusiastic, dedicated workforce that in turn 
helps care for and educate the next generation. 
“We realized many years ago that the more 
satisfied our staff is, the better equipped we are 
to deliver exceptional care to the families and 
children we serve,” says Fran Durekas, founder 
and chief development officer of CCLC. Caring 
for employees who care for children makes good 
business sense.1

The importance of employees to the 
success of any organization is the very basis 
of management. In this chapter, we explore 
the important issues of human resource 
management and motivation. We begin 
with a discussion of the ways organizations 
attract, develop, and retain employees. Then 
we describe the concepts behind motivation 
and the way human resource managers apply 
them to increase employee satisfaction and 
organizational effectiveness.
We also discuss the reasons why labor 
unions exist, and focus on legislation 
that affects labor–management relations. 
The process of collective bargaining is then 
discussed, along with tools used by unions 
and management in seeking their objectives.

Human Resources: 
The People Behind the People
A company is only as good as its workers. If people come to work each day eager to see 
each other, to do their very best on the job, to serve their customers, and to help their firm 
compete, then it’s very likely that company will be a success. The best companies value their 
employees just as much as their customers—without workers, there would be no goods or 
services to offer customers. Firms like Children’s 
Creative Learning Centers (CCLC) understand 
this, and do their best to hire top-quality employees 
and support them while they provide top-quality 
child care to customers. Achieving this level of job 
satisfaction and dedication among employees is the 
goal of human resource management, which 
attracts, develops, and retains the employees who 
can perform the activities necessary to accomplish 
organizational objectives.
Not every firm is large enough to have an 
entire human resources department. But whoever 
performs this function generally does the follow-
ing: plan for staffing needs, recruit and hire work-
ers, provide for training and evaluate performance, 
determine compensation and benefits, and oversee 
employee separation. In accomplishing these five 
tasks, shown in Figure 8.1, human resource 
managers achieve their objectives of
human resource 
management function of 
attracting, developing, and 
retaining employees who 
can perform the activities 
necessary to accomplish 
organizational objectives.
The best companies value their employees just as much as their customers. Firms 
like Children’s Creative Learning Centers (CCLC) understand this, and do their best 
to hire top-quality employees and support them while they provide top-quality child 
care to customers.

1. providing qualified, well-trained employees for the 
organization;
2. maximizing employee effectiveness in the organization; and
3. satisfying individual employee needs through monetary 
compensation, benefits, opportunities to advance, and job 
satisfaction.
Human resource plans must be based on an organization’s 
overall competitive strategies. In conjunction with other man-
agers, human resource managers predict how many employees 
a firm or department will need, and what skills those workers 
should bring to the job—along with what skills they might 
learn on the job. Human resource managers are often con-
sulted when a firm is considering reducing costs by laying off 
workers, or increasing costs by hiring new ones. They may be 
involved in both long-term and short-term planning.
Recruitment and 
Selection
Human resource managers recruit and help select the right workers for a company. To 
ensure that job candidates bring the necessary skills to the job or have the desire and ability to 
learn them, most firms implement the recruitment and selection process shown in Figure 8.2.
Finding Qualified Candidates
When the economy dips and jobs are lost, many people compete for a limited number of 
positions. When a company develops a great reputation for benefits or working conditions, 
it might be inundated with applications. But even with a large number of job candidates 
competing for a small number of openings, companies often have trouble finding the right 
person for each position. According to a recent survey, more than half the responding firms 
reported that while they had plenty of applicants, the “quality of candidates” was lacking. 
“We get tons of résumés from people,” laments one director of human resources. “We are 
just not getting highly qualified candidates.”2
In addition to traditional methods of recruiting, such as college job fairs, personal refer-
rals, and want ads, most companies now rely on their Web sites. A firm’s Web site might 
contain a career section with general employment information and a listing of open posi-
tions. Applicants are often able to submit a résumé and apply for an open position online. 
Appendix E, Careers in Contemporary Business, points out that some firms also post job 
openings on sites such as Monster.com.
Internet recruiting is such a quick, efficient, and inexpensive way to reach a large pool 
of job seekers that the vast majority of companies currently use the Internet, including social 
networking sites, to fill job openings. This is also the best way for firms to reach new col-
lege graduates and workers in their 20s and even 30s. Instead of focusing on handing out 
pamphlets at college job fairs, aerospace giant Boeing began posting job ads on Facebook.

Recruits were impressed. “My first impression was that Boeing is getting with 
the times,” said one college senior. “It shows the company is making an effort 
to talk to us on our level.” Boeing also uses Facebook to communicate with 
workers, including interns, who have been hired through more traditional 
channels. “We’ve got to go to their turf,” observes Rob Papandrea, who works 
in Boeing’s human resources department.3
Recruiting techniques continue to evolve as technology advances. 
JobsinPods.com is an online library of podcast interviews with hiring manag-
ers and employees at a variety of U.S. companies, including AT&T, Intel, and 
IBM. New podcasts, also called jobcasts, are posted in a blog format, and older 
podcasts are archived. Some describe employers’ hiring needs, while others talk 
about what it’s like to work at a particular company. Job seekers can also down-
load the podcasts to an iPod and listen to them at their leisure.4
Selecting and Hiring Employees
It’s the human resource manager’s job to select and hire employees, often in 
conjunction with department managers or supervisors. Every firm must 
follow state and federal employment laws. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against applicants based on their 
race, religion, color, sex, or national origin. The Americans with Disabilities Act 
of 1990 prohibits employers from discriminating against disabled applicants. 
The Civil Rights Act created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEOC) to investigate discrimination complaints. The Uniform Employee 
Selection Guidelines were adopted by the EEOC in 1978 to further clarify ways 
in which employers must ensure that their employees will be hired and managed 
without discrimination.5 The EEOC also helps employers set up affirmative 
action programs to increase job opportunities for women, minorities, people with 
disabilities, and other protected groups. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded 
the alternatives available to victims of employment discrimination by including 
the right to a jury trial, punitive damages, and damages for emotional distress. At 
the same time, opponents to such laws have launched initiatives to restrict affir-
mative action standards and protect employers against unnecessary litigation.
These laws, which are designed to level the playing field for all job seekers, 
have been the basis for thousands of legal cases over the years. Recently, UPS 
Freight agreed to pay a $46,000 settlement to a former employee because of reli-
gious discrimination. The employee, who is a Rastafarian, was told to shave his 
beard and cut his hair to comply with company grooming policy. Because long 
hair and a beard are part of Rastafarian worship, the employee requested accom-
modation. UPS fired him, which was a violation of his civil rights.6 Failure to comply with 
equal employment opportunity legislation can result in costly legal fees, expensive fines, bad 
publicity, and poor employee morale.
Because of the high cost of such lawsuits and settlements, human resource managers 
must understand the laws in order to prevent unintended violations. Even the process of 
interviewing a job candidate is covered by law. An interviewer may not ask any questions 
about marital status, children, race or nationality, religion, age, criminal records, mental 
illness, medical history, or alcohol and substance abuse problems. For more information 
about employment law, visit the Web sites of the Society for Human Resource Management 
(http://www.shrm.org) and the EEOC (http://www.eeoc.gov).

Navigating the maze of hiring restrictions is a 
challenge. Some firms try to screen out high-risk 
employees by requiring drug testing for job appli-
cants, particularly in industries that deal with public 
safety—such as air travel or truck driving. But drug 
testing is controversial because of privacy issues. Also, 
positive test results may not be accurate. Another 
issue is whether employees can be required to speak 
a particular language—usually English—in the work-
place. Although the EEOC views this as discrimina-
tion, a bill was recently introduced in the Tennessee 
legislature that would allow businesses to make this 
requirement as “an allowable employment practice.”7 
Employers may legally establish requirements for 
specific jobs—a bona fide occupational qualifica-
tion (BFOQ)—that may cut across EEOC protected 
classes.  For example, a designer of women’s clothes 
by necessity is permitted to hire only female models 
to show off new designs.
Recruitment and selection are expensive. There 
are costs for advertising, interviewing, administering employment tests and even medical 
exams. Once an applicant is hired, there are costs for training and perhaps equipment such 
as a computer. But a bad hiring decision is even more expensive, because the firm has to go 
through the whole process again to find the right person. One formula estimates that the 
total cost of a hiring mistake amounts to 24 times the applicant’s annual pay.8 So it’s espe-
cially important for human resource managers to make the best choices when it comes to 
recruitment and selection.
To avoid these mistakes—and to get the right person for the job—many employers 
require applicants to complete employment tests. These tests may verify certain skills, includ-
ing mechanical, technical, language, and computer skills. One example is the Wonderlic 
Basic Skills Test, which measures basic math and verbal skills. The Wonderlic is a cognitive 
ability test, which measures a person’s abilities in understanding words, numbers, and logic. 
Cognitive ability tests accurately predict job performance on many types of jobs.
Orientation, Training, and Evaluation
Once hired, employees need to know what is expected of them and how well they are 
performing. Companies provide this information through orientation, training, and evalu-
ation. A new hire may complete an orientation program administered jointly by the human 
resource personnel and the department in which the employee will work. During orienta-
tion, employees learn about company policies regarding their rights and benefits. They 
might receive an employee manual that includes the company’s code of ethics and code of 
conduct. And they’ll usually receive some form of training.
Training Programs
Training is a good investment for both employers and employees. Training provides 
workers with an opportunity to build their skills and knowledge, preparing them for new job

opportunities within the company. It also provides employers with a better chance at 
retaining long-term, loyal, high-performing workers. Verizon’s training program is ranked 
among the top in the United States. Verizon, which spends more than $450 million per year 
in employee development, education, and training, believes it’s the best investment any 
company could make. “We depend on a highly skilled workforce to deliver the best 
networks and customer solutions,” explains Marc Reed, executive vice president for human 
resources.9
On-the-Job Training One popular teaching method is on-the-job training, which 
prepares employees for job duties by allowing them to perform tasks under the guidance 
of experienced employees. A variation of on-the-job training is apprenticeship training, in 
which an employee learns a job by serving for a time as an assistant to a trained worker. 
While American apprenticeships usually focus on blue-collar trades—such as plumbing 
and heating services—in Europe, many new entrants to white-collar professions complete 
apprenticeships. McDonald’s now has apprenticeship-training programs in its U.K. restau-
rants as part of an economic stimulus plan launched by the British government. McDonald’s 
offered 6,000 apprenticeships in the first year of its program, increasing the number to 
10,000 the following year. “We’re letting people know that we’re as serious about education 
as we are about burgers and fries,” notes the company’s Web site.10
Classroom and Computer-Based Training Many firms offer some form 
of classroom instruction such as lectures, conferences, and workshops or seminars. Ernst & 
Young, a large tax-service firm, offers a training program called Ernst & Young and You 
(EYU), focusing on classroom learning, experiential learning, and coaching.11
Many firms are replacing classroom training with computer-based training programs, 
which can significantly reduce the cost of training. Computer-based training offers consis-
tent presentations, along with videos that can simulate the work environment. Employees 
can learn at their own pace without having to sign up for a class. Through online training 
programs, employees can engage in interactive learning—they might conference with a men-
tor or instructor who is located elsewhere; or they might participate in a simulation requir-
ing them to make decisions related to their work. In general, human resources managers 
agree on the value of training. In a study conducted about training, Accenture discovered 
that for every hour its competitors spent on training, Accenture spent two hours. Accenture 
invests heavily in its employees because it believes these workers will be capable of providing 
their company with a competitive edge in the marketplace.12
Management Development A management development program provides 
training designed to improve the skills and broaden the knowledge of current or future man-
agers and executives. Training may be aimed at increasing specific technical knowledge or 
more general knowledge in areas such as leadership and interpersonal skills. Glimmerglass 
Consulting Group, based in New Hampshire, provides management training in leadership, 
team development, and strategic implementation. After assessing a client’s work environ-
ment as well as the strengths and weaknesses of its management team, Glimmerglass coaches 
design a program intended to strengthen management’s leadership and team skills. The pro-
gram may involve an outdoor learning experience such as rock climbing. Glimmerglass’s cli-
ent list includes such firms as Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Shell International, Eastern Mountain 
Sports, and Big Brothers/Big Sisters.13
Despite the importance of training talented employees for managerial jobs, many com-
panies are searching for new hires to fill gaps in their executive ranks because they failed to 
develop future managers. In a move that surprised the international banking world, David de

Rothschild appointed a successor from outside 
his family—the first in 200 years—to take over 
running the group of financial advisory and 
wealth management companies that make up 
the Rothschild banking empire. Nigel Higgins 
is no stranger to the firm; he has worked there 
for 27 years. But Rothschild chose Higgins 
because there was no family member ready to 
handle the job. “If you’re not totally self-
centered, which I hope I am not, one thinks 
about how to increase the stability of the firm 
internally and externally,” explains Rothschild, 
who is only semi-retiring.14
Performance Appraisals
Feedback about performance is the best way 
for a company—and its employees to improve. 
Most firms use annual performance apprais-
als to evaluate an employee’s job performance and provide feedback about it. A performance 
appraisal can include assessments of everything from attendance to goals met. Based on this 
evaluation, a manager will make decisions about compensation, promotion, additional train-
ing needs, transfers, or even termination. While performance appraisals are common, not 
everyone agrees about their usefulness. Some management experts argue that a performance 
review is skewed in favor of a single manager’s subjective opinion—whether it’s positive or 
negative—and that most employees are afraid to speak honestly to their managers during a 
performance review.15 If a performance review is to be at all effective, it should meet the fol-
lowing criteria:
 
• take place several times a year;
 • be linked to organizational goals;
 • be based on objective criteria;
 • take place in the form of a two-way conversation.16
Some firms conduct peer reviews, in which employees assess the performance of their 
coworkers, while other firms ask employees to review their supervisors and managers. One 
such performance appraisal is the 360-degree performance review, a process that gathers feed-
back from a review panel of 8 to 12 people, including coworkers, supervisors, team members, 
subordinates, and sometimes even customers. The idea is to get as much frank feedback 
from as many perspectives as possible. By its very nature, this kind of review involves a lot 
of work, but employees benefit from it because they are more involved with the process and 
ultimately better understand their own strengths, weaknesses, and roles in the company. 
Managers benefit because they get much more in-depth feedback from all parts of the orga-
nization. Firms such as Halogen Software, with headquarters in Canada, offer computer 
programs to help firms gather and sift through this type of performance review data.17A 
potential weakness of 360-degree performance reviews is their anonymous nature—workers 
with personal likes and dislikes might try to influence the outcome.

Compensation
Compensation—how much employees are paid in money and benefits—is one of the 
most highly charged issues faced by human resource managers. The amount employees are 
paid, along with whatever benefits they receive, has a tremendous influence on where they 
live, what they eat, and how they spend their leisure time. It also has an effect on job satis-
faction. Balancing compensation for employees at all job levels can be a challenge for human 
resource managers.
Everyone likes to read about the companies—or the jobs—that pay their employees 
the most in cash and benefits. Fortune magazine lists an annual “100 Best Companies to 
Work For,” which includes information on compensation. Among the current compensation 
leaders are the Memphis-based law firm of Baker Donelson, whose partners receive an 
average of $320,000 (legal secretaries at the firm earn about $50,000 a year), and 
Salesforce.com, whose senior account executives bring home an average of $250,000 
annually.18 Of course, top executives at large companies earn a lot more than this—which 
has been brought up as an issue among employees and shareholders. The “Hit & Miss” 
feature discusses this topic.
The terms wages and salary are often used interchangeably, but actually are differ-
ent. Wages are based on an hourly pay rate or the amount of work accomplished. Typical 
wage earners are factory workers, construction workers, auto mechanics, retail salespeople, 
and restaurant wait staff. Salaries are calculated periodically, such as weekly or monthly. 
Salaried employees receive a set amount of pay that does not fluctuate with the number of 
hours worked. Whereas wage earners receive overtime pay, salaried workers do not. Office 
personnel, executives, and professional employees usually receive salaries.
An effective compensation system should attract well-qualified workers, keep them 
satisfied in their jobs, and inspire them to succeed. It’s also important to note that certain 
laws, including minimum wage, must be taken into account. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay 
Act of 2009 is one such law, which now gives workers more time to file a complaint for pay 
discrimination.19
Most firms base their compensation policies on the following factors: (1) what compet-
ing companies are paying, (2) government regulation, (3) cost of living, (4) company profits, 
and (5) an employee’s productivity. Many firms try to balance rewarding workers with main-
taining profits by linking more of their pay to superior performance. Firms try to motivate 
employees to excel by offering some type of incentive compensation in addition to salaries or 
wages. These programs include the following:
 
• profit sharing, which awards bonuses based on company profits;
 • gain sharing, when companies share the financial value of productivity gains, cost 
savings, or quality improvements with their workers;
 • lump-sum bonuses and stock options, which reward one-time cash payments and the 
right to purchase stock in the company based on performance; 
 • pay for knowledge, which distributes wage or salary increases as employees learn new 
job tasks.

Employee Benefits
In addition to wages and salaries, firms provide benefits to 
employees and their families as part of their compensation. Employee 
benefits—such as vacation, retirement plans, profit-sharing, health 
insurance, gym memberships, child and elder care, and tuition 
reimbursement—are paid entirely or in part by the company. Benefits 
represent a large component of an employee’s total compensation. 
Although wages and salaries account for around 70 percent of the 
typical employee’s earnings, the other 30 percent takes the form of 
employee benefits.20 Table 8.1 shows the breakdown of an average 
worker’s benefits as compared to wages or salary.
Some benefits are required by law. U.S. firms are required to 
make Social Security and Medicare contributions, as well as pay-
ments to state unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation 
programs, which protect workers in case of job-related injuries or illnesses. The Family and 
Medical Leave Act of 1993 requires covered employers to offer up to 12 weeks of unpaid, 
job-protected leave to eligible employees. Firms voluntarily provide other employee ben-
efits, such as child care and health insurance, to help them attract and retain employees. 
California is the first state to make paid family leave into law.21 As the “Solving an Ethical 
Controversy” feature discusses, some advocates are pressing state and federal lawmakers to 
require businesses to provide paid sick leave.

Executives at large institutions—particularly those on Wall 
Street—are accustomed to receiving huge compensation packages and 
multimillion-dollar bonuses each year. That may be fine when their firms 
are raking in profits. The problem is that they have continued to receive 
large paychecks despite steep financial losses. Making matters worse 
is the fact that some of the financial institutions for which they work 
accepted government assistance from the economic stimulus package.
Congress reacted to taxpayer outrage by enacting new rules, in 
which top executives at the firms receiving assistance must accept lim-
its on their cash bonuses. Lavish severance packages are now banned, 
and shareholders must approve executive pay. Despite these new regu-
lations, some firms continue to run amok when it comes to executive 
compensation. One such CEO took home a pay increase despite the 
fact that the company did so poorly it had to lay off employees. But 
others have voluntarily risen to the occasion. Aflac CEO Daniel Amos 
declined his bonus of nearly $3 million, and top executives at Ford 
Motor Company cut their own pay by 30 percent.
At the federal level, Kenneth Feinberg—a.k.a. the pay czar—has 
proposed new ground rules for executive compensation for companies 
everywhere. According to Feinberg, executives should be limited to 
$500,000 annually in cash compensation—anything additional should 
come in the form of stock or other benefits. Executives should pay for 
their own entertainment perks—like golf club memberships.
Overall, it appears that some true reforms may be on the horizon. 
Some executives might not like the new practices, but engaging in them 
voluntarily might be preferable. Companies and their boards will have 
to “adopt a set of core principles like accountability, alignment, fair-
ness, and transparency,” predicts compensation expert Donald Delves.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Some critics of the proposed changes in executive com-
pensation argue that reducing performance rewards will 
encourage talented managers to go elsewhere. Do you 
think this is a valid objection to pay limits? Why or 
why not?
2. Do you think shareholders and boards should have input 
on the size of compensation packages for CEOs? Why or 
why not?

In the past, companies have picked 
up most of the tab for healthcare ben-
efits, with employees paying little of 
the cost. However, with costs soaring 
nearly 15 percent each year, employers 
are passing along premium increases to 
employees. Many companies now offer 
incentives for workers to live healthier 
lives. Gym memberships, nutrition 
programs, wellness visits to the doc-
tor, and smoking-cessation classes are 
all examples of these incentives. SAS 
has its own medical center, along with 
a free on-site gym. The firm provides 
an abundance of other employee ben-
efits as well, including on-site daycare, 
unlimited sick days, and a summer 
camp for kids. In addition to all of that, 
SAS still pays 90 percent of its 
employees’ monthly insurance 
premiums.22
Pensions and other retirement plans make up a chunk of employee benefits. Recently, 
some companies have shrunk the matching contributions they will make to workers’ 401(k) 
plans—retirement savings plans to which employees can make pretax contributions. Some 
firms have cut back on cash contributions to their employees’ plans and now contribute com-
pany stock instead. However, others have managed to continue with a higher rate of funding.

Flexible Benefits
In response to increasing diversity in the workplace, firms are developing creative ways 
to tailor their benefit plans to the needs of employees. One approach sets up flexible benefit 
plans, also called cafeteria plans. This system offers employees a choice of benefits, including 
different types of medical insurance, dental and vision plans, and life and disability insurance. 
This flexibility allows one working spouse to choose medical coverage for the entire family, 
while the other spouse uses benefit dollars to buy other types of coverage. Typically, each 
employee receives a set allowance (called flex dollars or credits) to pay for benefits depending 
on his or her needs. Contributions to cafeteria accounts can be made by both the employee 
and employer. Cafeteria plans also offer tax benefits to both employees and employers.
Another way of increasing the flexibility of employee benefits involves time off from 
work. Instead of establishing set numbers of holidays, vacation days, and sick days, some 
CLASS ACTIVITY:

benefits are becoming more

The United States is the only one of the world’s major economic 
powers that does not require employers to provide paid sick days. 
Advocates say the country should follow the lead of other developed 
nations and make paid sick days a basic labor standard.
U.S. businesses voluntarily provide paid sick days for about 
86 percent of full-time workers. The Family and medical Leave Act 
(FMLA) requires that all businesses with more than 50 employees 
provide their workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for illness, 
childbirth or adoption, or care of a family member who is sick. The 
proposed Healthy Families Act (HFA) is an attempt to close the gap 
between these two situations. The HFA would require employers to pro-
vide their workers with a specified number of paid sick days each year.
Should businesses be required to provide paid sick 
leave for their employees?
Summary
Those in favor of paid sick leave argue that it is a matter of basic workers’ rights, and would benefit 
mostly low-income employees who are already struggling to make ends meet. Opponents say that the bur-
den is too great for most businesses and would result in lost productivity, a reduction in wages to offset the 
cost, and perhaps a loss in the number of jobs altogether.

PRO
1. A healthy workforce is vital to the competitiveness of any firm. 
When an employee is unable to seek time off for medical treatment for 
an illness, it puts the company at risk. “Not only is this situation bad for 
sick workers and their families, but it puts other workers and the public 
at risk of contracting infectious illnesses,” points out one public official.
2. No worker should be penalized for being ill. “The purpose of 
this bill [HFA] is that you cannot be fired because you’re sick,” notes 
Maine Senate President Elizabeth Mitchell.
CON
1. Requiring firms to pay for sick leave adds to the cost of doing 
business, and employers may be forced to cut other benefits, institute 
a hiring freeze, or lay people off because they can’t afford the added 
expense.
2. Workers may be encouraged to misuse their sick leave, and 
when one takes unplanned time off, an employer may be forced to 
pay a temporary worker in addition to the permanent employee who 
is out sick.
Should Paid Sick Leave Be Required by Law?

employers give each employee a bank of paid time off (PTO). Employees 
use days from their PTO accounts without having to explain why they 
need the time. The greatest advantage of PTO is the freedom it gives 
workers to make their own choices; the greatest disadvantage is that it is 
an expensive benefit for employers.24
Flexible Work
Some firms are moving toward the option of flexible work plans, which 
are benefits that allow employees to adjust their working hours or places 
of work according to their needs. Flexible work plan options include 
flextime, compressed workweeks, job sharing, and home-based work (tele-
commuting). These benefit programs have reduced employee turnover 
and absenteeism, and boosted productivity and job satisfaction. Flexible 
work has become critical in attracting and keeping talented human 
resources.
Flextime allows employees to set their own work hours within cer-
tain constraints. Rather than scheduling everyone to work between 8:00 
a.m. and 5:00 p.m., a manager might stipulate that all employees be at 
work between the core hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Outside the 
core hours, employees can choose to start and end early, or start and end 
late. Flextime works well in jobs that are independent, but not so well 
when teams or direct customer service are involved. Flextime is popular 
in Europe, where 56 percent of all companies offer some kind of flextime 
arrangement.25
With the help of programs from BidShift, a San Diego company that specializes in Internet-
based scheduling software, the logistic problems of flexible scheduling are solved for users such 
as the San Angelo Community Medical Center. BidShift’s programs allow managers to post 
schedules online, where employees log in and request certain shifts or schedule changes.26
Some companies offer a compressed workweek, which allows employees to work longer 
hours on fewer days. Employees might work four 10-hour days and then have three days 
off each week. Such arrangements not only reduce the number of hours employees spend 
commuting each week, but can stretch out the company’s overall workday, providing more 
availability to customers in other time zones. Hospitals, police and fire departments, and 
airlines often offer work schedules that allow several long days matched by several days off. 
About 40 percent of Macy’s employees opt for a compressed workweek. According to the 
retailer’s human resource department, this benefit is valued second only to pay and medical 
insurance. “We’ve invested a lot in our people,” notes Ed Cooney, senior vice president of 
human resources. “When we offer work options, it’s not totally unselfish. We know it results 
in more loyalty and less absenteeism.”27
A job sharing program allows two or more employees to divide the tasks of one job. This 
plan appeals to a growing number of people who prefer to work part-time rather than 
full-time—such as older workers, students, working parents, and people of all ages who 
want to devote time to personal interests or leisure. Job sharing requires a lot cooperation 
and communication between the partners, but a company can benefit from the talents of 
both people. Some economists believe that a federal job-sharing program, which would give 
workers access to emergency unemployment insurance, would help prevent layoffs during 
times when unemployment is high. Seventeen states have already adopted such legislation. 
However, opponents disagree because of the cost.28

Home-based work programs allow employees to perform their jobs from home instead 
of at the workplace. These telecommuters are connected to their employers via the Internet, 
voice and video conferencing, and mobile devices. Working from home generally appeals 
to employees who want freedom, but also to persons with disabilities, older workers, and 
parents. Companies benefit from telework arrangements because they can expand their pool 
of talent and increase productivity without increasing costs.29 Telecommuters need to be 
self-disciplined and reliable employees. They also need managers who are comfortable with 
setting goals and managing from afar. Forrester Research predicts that telecommuting will 
grow from its current 34 million workers to 63 million by the year 2016.30
More than 70 percent of Generation Y professionals—those just entering the work-
force—are concerned with balancing career with personal life. Most simply reject the idea of 
sitting in an office cubicle for 8 to 10 hours a day. They want the flexibility to do their jobs 
anywhere, any time.31 This is placing increasing pressure on companies to offer options like 
job sharing, compressed workweeks, and telecommuting.
Employee Separation
Employee separation is a broad term covering the loss of an employee for any reason, 
voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary separation includes workers who resign to take a job at 
another firm or start a business. Involuntary separation includes downsizing and outsourcing.
Voluntary and Involuntary Turnover
Turnover occurs when an employee leaves his or her job. Voluntary turnover occurs 
when the employee decides to resign—perhaps to take another job, start a new business, or 
retire. The human resource manager might ask the employee for an exit interview to find 
out why he or she is leaving; this conversation can provide valuable information to a firm. 
An employee might decide to resign because of lack of career opportunities. Learning this, 
the human resource manager might offer ongoing training.32 Another might resign because 
of low pay. In that case, the human resource manager might offer a raise. The “Business 
Etiquette” feature offers some advice on how to ask for a raise. Sometimes employees choose 
to resign and accept jobs at other firms because they fear upcoming layoffs. In this case, the 
human resource manager might be able to allay fears about job security.
Involuntary turnover occurs when employees are terminated because of poor job per-
formance or unethical behavior in business practices or in the workplace. No matter how 
necessary a termination may be, it is never easy for either the human resource manager or the 
employee. The employee may react with anger or tears; coworkers may take sides. Human 
resource managers should remain calm and professional, and must be educated in employment 
laws. Protests against wrongful dismissal are often involved in complaints filed by the EEOC 
or by lawsuits brought by fired employees. Involuntary turnover also occurs when firms are 
forced to eliminate jobs as a cost-cutting measure, as in the case of downsizing or outsourcing.
Downsizing
As the economy tightens, companies are often faced with the hard choice of terminating 
employees in order to cut costs or streamline the organization. Downsizing is the process 
of reducing the number of employees within a firm by eliminating jobs. Downsizing can be

How to Ask for a Raise
Just thinking about asking your boss for a raise might cause your hands to 
sweat. You fear rejection or worse, retaliation. But if you know that you are 
doing a superior job—including taking the initiative when it’s not required—
or it’s been more than a year since your last increase, then perhaps it’s time to 
make a case for yourself. You should be able to at least open the conversation 
with your boss. Here are a few tips for making your effort successful:
 • Be prepared. Find out whether there is a policy for raises at your company, 
including a range or sliding scale for each position. Learn where your 
current pay lies along the scale.
 • Gather important data about yourself. Consistently document your work accom-
plishments, including extra projects or tasks you’ve undertaken and done 
well. Keep a log of positive feedback from coworkers, other supervisors, 
and customers. If the praise is already in writing, that’s even better.
 • Think through exactly what you want. Is it a percentage increase? A dollar 
amount? Or perhaps expanded vacation time or time off for career edu-
cation? Make sure your request is reasonable. When you meet with your 
supervisor, be as speciﬁ c as possible.
 • Don’t be pushy or hasty in your conversation. At the same time, put forth your 
argument with conﬁ dence. Your goal is to get your supervisor to open up 
to thinking about the possibility of meeting your request.
 • If your supervisor turns down your request, ask for speciﬁ cs about what you need 
to do in order to qualify for the raise—and when. If possible, ask for a follow-up 
meeting within a certain period of time, such as two months.
 • When you return to your desk or ofﬁ ce, send your supervisor an e-mail thanking 
him or her for meeting with you, and politely recap the results of the conversa-
tion. If your request has been granted, make sure your performance lives 
up to it. If your supervisor has deferred a decision, don’t give up. Get 
back to work, document everything, and earn that raise.

accomplished through early retirement plans or 
voluntary severance programs. But these options 
don’t always accomplish the goal, as was the case 
for AOL in a recent downsizing effort described 
in the “Hit & Miss” feature.
While some firms report improvements 
in profits, market share, employee productivity, 
quality, and customer service after downsizing, 
research is beginning to show that downsizing 
doesn’t guarantee those improvements. “Much of 
the conventional wisdom about downsizing—like 
the fact that it automatically drives a company’s 
stock price higher, or increases profitability—turns 
out to be wrong,” notes Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford 
University.33 Downsizing can have the following 
negative effects:
 
• Anxiety, health problems, and lost productiv-
ity among remaining workers.
 • Expensive severance packages paid to laid-off 
workers.
 • A domino effect on the local economy—
unemployed workers have less money to spend, 
creating less demand for consumer goods and 
services, increasing the likelihood of more lay-
offs and other failing businesses.34
If downsizing is ultimately the only alterna-
tive for company survival, then there are steps 
that managers can take to make sure it is done 
the best way possible. If a firm is committed to 
its workforce as part of its mission, then it will do 
everything it can to support both the workers who 
must leave and those who will stay. When Xilinx 
Inc., a California semiconductor manufacturer, was 
forced to shrink its operations or close altogether, 
the company took several steps to avoid outright 
layoffs. Xilinx temporarily shut down plants and 
offered voluntary retirement plans and sabbatical 
leaves. Human resource managers discussed the 
situation with employees before making pay cuts. 
By taking these measures—in which all employ-
ees made some sacrifice—the company survived 
its downturn without making any involuntary 
terminations.35

Chapter 8  Human Resource Management: From Recruitment to Labor Relations
267
People don’t want to leave their jobs, especially when the econ-
omy is tighter than usual and unemployment numbers are already high. 
But that’s what AOL asked its workers to do in a recent effort to down-
size the company and control costs. AOL asked for 2,500 volunteer 
separations and only received 1,100. That left a gap of 1,400 workers. 
The goal was to reduce the firm’s workforce by more than 30 percent, 
from 6,900 to about 4,400.
AOL, which had been struggling for several years under the 
merger with Time Warner, finally spun off as an independent 
company—but a damaged one. AOL management decided that the 
only way to turn the company around was to trim as much expense as 
possible, from every limb of the organization. The turnaround initiative, 
dubbed Project Everest, was led by new CEO Tim Armstrong, a former 
sales executive for Google. After downsizing the workforce, Armstrong 
planned to refocus AOL’s business in a few select areas, including 
content, online advertising, and communications. “Project Everest is 
the completion of phase one of AOL’s turnaround,” noted a company 
spokesperson.
If all of this sounds a bit cold-hearted and short-sighted to you, 
it does to others as well. One of the greatest blows to a company in 
the wake of layoffs is to the remaining workers’ morale. Layoffs are 
devastating to those who are let go and just as traumatic to those who 
remain. Productivity often slides, as does the image of the company. 
“There’s substantial research into the physical and health effects of 
downsizing on employees—research that reinforces the notion that 
layoffs are literally killing people,” warns Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford 
University. In the case of AOL, the firm actually hired new salespeople 
to ensure continued advertising client coverage. In addition, AOL man-
agers held meetings with advertisers to inform them of the actions 
being taken, and sent notes to certain clients containing private contact 
information for top executives. Despite these measures, some advertis-
ing clients have decided to take their business elsewhere. In an effort 
to rebuild its business, AOL may have lost one of its most valuable 
assets—its best people.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Do you think it was a good decision for AOL to ask for 
volunteers to resign before making layoffs? Why or why 
not?
2. Could AOL managers have better prepared their clients 
for the downsizing?

Outsourcing
Another way that firms shrink themselves into leaner organizations is by outsourcing. 
Outsourcing involves transferring jobs from inside a firm to outside the firm. Jobs that 
are typically outsourced include office maintenance, deliveries, food service, and security. 
However, other job functions can be outsourced as well, including manufacturing, design, 
information technology (IT), and accounting. In general, in order to save expenses and 
remain flexible, companies will try to outsource functions that are not part of their core 
business.
Although outsourcing might work on paper, the reality might be different. When 
United Airlines announced plans to outsource some of its engineering work from its San 
Francisco maintenance hub to India, employees, government officials, safety experts, and the 
general public questioned the move. Fifty employees were scheduled to be laid off, but that 
wasn’t the main issue. Instead, the airline was questioned for potentially compromising the 
safety of its aircraft and those on board. “I am particularly concerned by the idea of engi-
neering drawings being done overseas and then being handed off to personnel in the U.S.,” 
noted one official, “perhaps without an opportunity for the overseas and domestic personnel 
to address fundamental flaws in proposed repairs.” The airline responded to say that safety 
would remain their top concern.36

Motivating Employees
Motivating employees to commit to their company and perform their best on the job is 
one of the main goals of a manager. Motivation starts with good employee morale. Morale is 
the mental attitude of employees toward their employer and jobs, involving a common sense 
of purpose.
High employee morale occurs in organizations where workers feel valued, heard, and 
empowered to contribute what they do best. High morale generally results from good 
management, including an understanding of human needs and an effort to satisfy those 
needs in ways that move the company forward. Low employee morale, on the other hand, 
usually signals a poor relationship between managers and employees and often results in 
absenteeism, voluntary turnover, and a lack of motivation.
Generally speaking, managers use rewards and punishments to motivate employees. 
Extrinsic rewards are external to the work itself, such as pay, fringe benefits, and praise. 
Intrinsic rewards are feelings related to performing the job, such as feeling proud about 
meeting a deadline or achieving a sales goal. Punishment involves a negative consequence 
for such behavior as being late, skipping staff meetings, or treating a customer poorly.
There are several theories of motivation, all of which relate back to the basic process 
of motivation itself, which involves the recognition of a need, the move toward meeting 
that need, and the satisfaction of that need. For instance, if you are hungry you might be 
motivated to make yourself a peanut butter sandwich. Once you have eaten the sandwich, 
the need is satisfied and you are no longer hungry. Figure 8.4 illustrates the process of 
motivation.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Theory
The studies of psychologist Abraham H. Maslow suggest how managers can motivate 
employees. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has become a widely accepted list of human 
needs based on these important assumptions:
 
•  People’s needs depend on what they already 
possess.
 •  A satisfied need is not a motivator; only 
needs that remain unsatisfied can influence 
behavior.
 •  People’s needs are arranged in a hierarchy 
of importance; once they satisfy one need, at 
least partially, another emerges and demands 
satisfaction.
In his theory, Maslow proposed that all 
people have basic needs such as hunger and 
protection that they must satisfy before they 
can consider higher-order needs such as social 
relationships or self-worth. He identified five 
types of needs:

1. Physiological needs. These basic human needs include food, shelter, and clothing. On the 
job, employers satisfy these needs by paying salaries and wages and providing a heated or 
cooled workspace.
2. Safety needs. These needs refer to desires for physical and economic protection. Companies 
satisfy these needs with benefits like health insurance and meeting safety standards in the 
workplace.
3. Social (belongingness) needs. People want to be accepted by family, friends and coworkers. 
Managers might satisfy these needs through teamwork and group lunches.
4. Esteem needs. People like to feel valued and recognized by others. Managers can meet these 
needs through special awards or privileges.
5. Self-actualization needs. These needs drive people to seek fulfillment of their dreams and 
capabilities. Employers can satisfy these needs by offering challenging or creative projects, 
along with opportunities for education and advancement.37
According to Maslow, people must satisfy the lower-order needs in the hierarchy (physi-
ological and safety needs) before they are motivated to satisfy higher-order needs (social, 
esteem, and self-actualization needs).
Herzberg’s Two-Factor Model of Motivation
More than 50 years ago, Frederick Herzberg—a social psychologist and consultant—came 
up with a theory of motivation and work that is still popular today. Herzberg surveyed work-
ers to find out when they felt good or bad about their jobs. He learned that certain factors 
were important to job satisfaction though they might not contribute directly to motivation. 
These hygiene factors (or maintenance factors) refer to aspects of work that are not directly 
related to a task itself but related to the job environment, including pay, job security, working 
conditions, status, interpersonal relations, technical supervision, and company policies.
Motivator factors, on the other hand, can produce high levels of motivation when they are 
present. These relate directly to the specific aspects of a job, including job responsibilities, 
achievement and recognition, and opportunities for growth. Hygiene factors are extrinsic, 
while motivators are intrinsic. Managers should remember that hygiene factors, though not 
motivational, can result in satisfaction. But if managers wish to motivate employees, they 
should emphasize recognition, achievement, and growth. Companies that make the various 
lists of “best places to work” always have managers who understand what it takes to motivate 
employees, regardless of how large or small the firms are. Madison Magazine ranks its top 
companies based on criteria such as trust, rewards, and work–life balance. Wisconsin-based 
HospiceCare, which has 348 workers, recently earned the top spot on the list because, “Just 
as HospiceCare considers its patients and their families a mission and a calling, it realizes 
that it cannot care for patients without employees who are cared for as well.”38

Expectancy Theory and Equity Theory
Victor Vroom’s expectancy theory of motivation describes the process people use 
to evaluate the likelihood that their efforts will yield the results they want, along with the 
degree to which they want those results. Expectancy theory suggests that people use three 
factors to determine how much effort to put forth. First is a person’s subjective prediction 
that a certain effort will lead to the desired result. This is the “can do” component of an 
employee’s approach to work. Second is the value of the outcome (reward) to the person. 
Third is the person’s assessment of how likely a successful performance will lead to a desir-
able reward. Vroom’s expectancy theory is summarized in Figure 8.5. In short, an employee 
is motivated if he or she thinks he or she can complete a task. Next, the employee assesses 
the reward for accomplishing the task and is motivated if the reward is worth the effort.
Equity theory is concerned with an individual’s perception of fair and equitable treat-
ment. In their work, employees first consider their effort and then their rewards. Next, 
employees compare their results against those of their coworkers. As shown in Figure 8.6, 
if employees feel they are under-rewarded for their effort in comparison with others doing 
similar work, equity theory suggests they will decrease their effort to restore the balance. 
Conversely, if employees feel they are over-rewarded, they will feel guilty and put more 
effort into their job to restore equity and reduce guilt.
Many workers are willing to work hard as long as the burden is shared. Income inequal-
ity is higher in the United States than in any other developed society in the world. The top 
10 percent of U.S. employees now earn 50 percent of all income. Many employees who, 
arguably, work just as hard as top managers, believe this is unfair. A bill called the Income 
Equity Act has been introduced several times in Congress, but has been defeated.39
Goal-Setting Theory and Management by Objectives
Needs motivate people to direct their behavior toward something that will satisfy their 
needs. That something is a goal. A goal is a target, objective, or result that someone tries to 
accomplish. Goal-setting theory says that people will be motivated to the extent to which

they accept specific, challenging goals and receive feedback 
that indicates their progress toward goal achievement. As 
shown in Figure 8.7, the basic components of goal-setting 
theory are goal specificity, goal difficulty, goal acceptance, 
and performance feedback.
Goal specificity is the extent to which goals are clear 
and concrete. A goal such as “we want to reduce our car-
bon footprint” is vague and hard to pin down. But, “we 
want to reduce our carbon footprint by 2 percent” gives 
employees a clear target. Goal difficulty outlines how hard 
the goal is to reach. A more difficult goal, such as “we want 
to reduce our carbon footprint by 5 percent in three years” 
is actually more motivating than the easier goal.
Goal acceptance is the extent to which people under-
stand and agree to the goal. If a goal is too challenging—
such as reducing the firm’s carbon footprint by 20 percent 
in two years—people are likely to reject it. Finally, perfor-
mance feedback is information about performance and how 
well the goal has been met. Goal setting typically won’t 
work unless performance feedback is provided.
Goals help focus workers’ attention on the impor-
tant parts of their jobs. Goals also energize and motivate 
people. They create a positive tension between the current 
state of affairs and the desired state. This tension is satisfied by meeting the goal or aban-
doning it.
Fifty years ago, Peter Drucker introduced a goal-setting technique called manage-
ment by objectives (MBO) in his book, The Practice of Management. MBO is a systematic 
approach that allows managers to focus on attainable goals and to achieve the best results 
based on the organization’s resources. MBO helps motivate individuals by aligning their 
objectives with the goals of the organization, increasing overall organizational performance.

MBO clearly outlines people’s tasks, goals, and contributions to the company. MBO is a 
collaborative process between managers and employees. MBO principles include the 
following:
 • a series of related organizational goals and objectives;
 • specific objectives for each person;
 • participative decision making;
 • a set time period to accomplish goals; and
 • performance evaluation and feedback.
Job Design and Motivation
Today’s human resource managers constantly search for ways to motivate employees 
through their jobs. Three ways that jobs can be restructured to be more motivating are 
through job enlargement, job enrichment, and job rotation.
Job enlargement is a job design that expands an employee’s responsibilities by increasing 
the number and variety of tasks. Redesigning the production process is one way to accom-
plish this. Instead of having an assembly line on which each worker repeatedly completes the 
same task, modular work areas allow employees to complete a variety of tasks, which may 
result in the construction of an entire product.
Job enrichment involves an expansion of job duties that empowers an employee to make 
decisions and learn new skills leading toward career growth. The Pampered Chef is a direct 
seller of kitchen tools and housewares that gives its managers and sales consultants the power 
to make decisions about many aspects of their work. Kitchen consultants, who organize 
home sales parties, can decide how much or how little they want to work and receive various 
incentive rewards for performance. The company’s mission is to provide “opportunities for 
individuals to develop their talents and skills to their fullest potential for the benefit of them-
selves, their families, our customers, and the company.”40
Job rotation involves systematically moving employees from one job to another. Job 
rotation increases the range of activities by introducing workers to more jobs and therefore 
more tasks. The goal is to increase employees’ interest in their jobs and allow them to learn 
more about the company. Nurses might rotate from oncology to the ICU in a hospital. Job 
rotation is often part of a training program, as is the case at EMC, a global provider of busi-
ness solutions for data backup, information security, risk and compliance, and many other 
products. EMC offers motivated employees the chance to participate in rotational training 
programs in business, leadership, finance, and other areas.41
Managers’ Attitudes and Motivation
A manager’s attitude toward his or her employees greatly influences their motivation. 
Maslow’s theory, described earlier, has helped managers understand that employees have 
a range of needs beyond their paychecks. Psychologist Douglas McGregor, a student of 
Maslow, studied motivation from the perspective of how managers view employees. After 
observing managers’ interactions with employees, McGregor created two basic labels for 
the assumptions that different managers make about their workers’ behavior, and how these 
assumptions affect management styles.

management must coerce them to do their jobs. Theory X managers believe that the 
average worker prefers to receive instructions, avoid responsibility, take little initiative, 
and views money and job security as the only valid motivators—Maslow’s lower order 
of needs.
 • Theory Y assumes that the typical person actually likes work and will seek and accept 
greater responsibility. Theory Y managers assume that most people can think of creative 
ways to solve work-related problems, and should be given the opportunity to participate 
in decision making. Unlike the traditional management philosophy that relies on 
external control and constant supervision, Theory Y emphasizes self-control and self-
direction—Maslow’s higher order of needs.
Another perspective on management, proposed by management professor William 
Ouchi, has been labeled Theory Z. Organizations structured on Theory Z concepts attempt 
to blend the best of American and Japanese management practices. This approach views 
worker involvement as the key to increased productivity for the company and improved 
quality of work life for employees. Many U.S. firms have adopted the participative manage-
ment style used in Japanese firms by asking workers for suggestions to improve their jobs 
and then giving them the authority to implement proposed changes.
Labor–Management Relations
The U.S. workplace is far different from what it was a century ago, when child labor, 
unsafe working conditions, and a 72-hour workweek were common. The development of 
labor unions, labor legislation, and the collective bargaining process have contributed to 
the changed environment. Today’s human resource managers must be educated in labor-
management relations, the settling of disputes, and the competitive tactics of unions and 
management.
Development of Labor Unions
A labor union is a group of workers who have banded together to achieve com-
mon goals in the areas of wages, hours, and working conditions. The organized efforts of 
Philadelphia printers in 1786 resulted in the first U.S. minimum wage—$1 a day. One hun-
dred years later, New York City streetcar conductors were able to negotiate a reduction in 
their workday from 17 to 12 hours.
Labor unions can be found at the local, national, and international levels. A local union 
represents union members in a specific area, such as a single community, while a national 
union is a labor organization consisting of numerous local chapters. An international union is a 
national union with membership outside the United States, usually in Canada. More than 
15 million U.S. workers—about 12 percent of the nation’s full-time workforce—belong to 
labor unions.42 Although only about 8 percent of workers in the private sector are union-
ized, more than one-third of government workers belong to unions. The largest union in the 
United States is the 3.2 million-member National Education Association (NEA), representing 
public school teachers and other support personnel. Other large unions include the 2.2 million

the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the 1.3 million members of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers, and the 640,000 members of the United Auto Workers.
Labor Legislation
Over the past century, some major pieces of labor legislation have been enacted, includ-
ing the following:
 • National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (Wagner Act). Legalized collective bargaining 
and required employers to negotiate with elected representatives of their employees. 
Established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to supervise union elections 
and prohibit unfair labor practices such as firing workers for joining unions, refusing 
to hire union sympathizers, threatening to close if workers unionize, interfering 
with or dominating the administration of a union, and refusing to bargain with 
a union.
 • Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Set the first federal minimum wage (25 cents an hour), 
and maximum basic workweek for certain industries. Also outlawed child labor.
 • Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 (Labor–Management Relations Act). Limited unions’ power by 
banning such practices as coercing employees to join unions, coercing employers to 
discriminate against employees who are not union members, discrimination against non-
union employees, picketing or conducting secondary boycotts or strikes for illegal pur-
poses, and excessive initiation fees.
 • Landrum-Griffin Act of 1959 (Labor–Management Reporting and Disclosure Act). Amended 
the Taft-Hartley Act to promote honesty and democracy in running unions’ internal 
affairs. Required unions to set up a constitution and bylaws and to hold regularly 
scheduled elections of union officers by secret ballot. Set forth a bill of rights for 
members. Required unions to submit certain financial reports to the U.S. Secretary 
of Labor.
The Collective Bargaining Process
Labor unions work to increase job security for their members and to improve wages, 
hours, and working conditions. These goals are achieved primarily through collective 
bargaining, the process of negotiation between management and union representatives.
Union contracts, which typically cover a two- or three-year period, are often the result 
of weeks or months of discussion, disagreement, compromise, and eventual agreement. Once 
agreement is reached, union members must vote to accept or reject the contract. If the con-
tract is rejected, union representatives may resume the bargaining process with management 
representatives, or union members may strike to obtain their demands.
Settling Labor–Management Disputes
Strikes make the headlines, but most labor–management negotiations result in a signed 
contract. If a dispute arises, it is usually settled through a mechanism such as a grievance

procedure, mediation, or arbitration. Any of 
these alternatives is quicker and less expen-
sive than a strike.
The union contract serves as a guide to 
relations between the firm’s management 
and its employees. The rights of each party 
are stated in the agreement. But no contract, 
regardless of how detailed, will eliminate the 
possibility of disagreement. Such differences 
can be the beginning of a grievance, a com-
plaint—by a single employee or by the entire 
union—that management is violating some 
portion of the contract. Almost all union 
contracts require these complaints to be sub-
mitted through a formal grievance procedure 
similar to the one shown in Figure 8.8. A 
grievance might involve a dispute about pay, 
working hours, or the workplace itself. The 
grievance procedure usually begins with an 
employee’s supervisor and then moves up the 
company’s hierarchy. If the highest level of 
management can’t settle the grievance, it is 
submitted to an outside party for mediation 
or arbitration.
Mediation is the process of settling labor–management disputes through an impartial 
third party. Although the mediator does not make the final decision, he or she can hear the 
whole story and make objective recommendations. If the dispute remains unresolved, the 
two parties can turn to arbitration—bringing in an outside arbitrator, who renders a legally 
binding decision. The arbitrator must be acceptable both to the union and to management, 
and his or her decision is final. Most union negotiations go to arbitration if union and man-
agement representatives fail to reach a contract agreement.
Competitive Tactics of Unions and Management
Both unions and management use tactics to make their views known and to win support.
Union Tactics The chief tactics of unions are strikes, picketing, and boycotts. 
The strike, or walkout, is one of the most effective tools of the labor union. It involves a 
temporary work stoppage by workers until a dispute has been settled or a contract signed. 
A strike generally seeks to disrupt business as usual, calling attention to workers’ needs and 
union demands. Strikes can last for days or weeks and can be costly to both sides. One recent 
strike between Bell Helicopter Textron and the United Auto Workers involved 2,500 
workers and lasted 27 days, amounting to 67,500 lost work days.43 Although a strike is 
powerful, it can also be damaging to the very people it is trying to help. Surrounding busi-
nesses may suffer too. If striking workers aren’t eating at their usual lunch haunts, those 
businesses will lose profits.
Picketing, which involves workers marching in a public protest against their employer, 
is another effective form of union pressure. As long as picketing does not involve violence

Picketing may accompany a strike, or it 
may be a protest against alleged unfair 
labor practices. Hundreds of striking 
British Airways workers picketed a soccer 
field near Heathrow airport during a par-
ticularly tense standoff during a strike over 
a holiday weekend. Although planes con-
tinued to take off and land over the field, 
passengers could see the angry 
workers below.44
A boycott is an organized attempt to 
keep the public from purchasing the goods 
or services of a firm. Some unions have 
been quite successful in organizing boy-
cotts, and some unions even fine members 
who defy a boycott.
Management Tactics 
Man agement also has tactics for compet-
ing with organized labor when negotia-
tions break down. In the past, it has used 
the lockout—a management “strike” to put 
pressure on union members by closing the 
firm. However, companies more commonly 
try to recruit strikebreakers in highly visible 
fields such as professional sports, or transfer 
supervisors and other nonunion employees 
to continue operations during strikes. In 
the British Airways strike described earlier, 
management leased aircraft from other 
airlines and used volunteer pilots and man-
agers to take the place of the striking cabin 
crews.45
The Future of Labor Unions
Union membership and influence grew through most of the 20th century by giving 
industrial workers a voice in decisions about their wages, benefits, and working conditions. 
However, as the United States, western Europe, and Japan have shifted from manufacturing 
economies to information and service economies, union membership and influence 
has declined. Today, 52 percent of all union members are government employees; three 
times more union members now work for the U.S. Postal Service than work in the 
auto industry.46

and adapt to a global economy and diverse workforce. They can respond to the growing

Labor Unions and Green Construction
The construction industry has nearly unlimited opportunities 
to change the look of the world—or at least, make it greener. 
One labor union, the Operative Plasterers and Cement Masons 
International Association (OPCMIA) has already recognized this 
and is training its members in the use of new green technologies 
and processes that will ultimately improve the energy efficiency and 
reduce the carbon footprint of the nation’s infrastructure. As the 
construction industry begins implementing these new technologies, 
particularly to achieve LEED status, workers need to know how to 
use them.
The OPCMIA training program is called Green Five. It is now 
being incorporated into existing training curricula in order to reach 
about 5,400 participants in 70 programs spread across local chapters, 
community colleges, vocational/technical schools, and OPCMIA Joint 
Apprenticeship and Training Centers. The Green Five program is 
training plasterers and cement masons in the sustainable use and 
application of the following materials: polished concrete, pervi-
ous concrete, exterior insulation finish systems, and American Clay. 
American Clay is a color mineral coating that is toxin free, VOC 
(volatile organic compound) free, and mold resistant. Training in 
the use of this product involves the preparation, mixing the material, 
hand application, primers, additives and sealers, and maintaining and 
repairing walls.
The Green Five program includes Green Awareness Training, 
which deals with energy-efficient building construction in general, 
addresses the process of energy assessment and retrofitting 
existing buildings, and provides an overview of environmentally 
sustainable products and manufacturing processes. Leadership 
training and “train-the-trainer” courses are offered as well. 
“Program participants include construction workers, building 
engineers, and energy auditors as part of our outreach toward 
making green construction knowledge accessible to the whole of 
the industry,” says Gerry Ryan, director of training, health and 
safety for OPCMIA.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. In what ways does adopting a progressive stance toward 
“green” training help secure an important industry role 
for OPCMIA going forward?
2. In addition to construction, what other industries might 
benefit from unions taking a leadership role in sustain-
ability training? How might these steps benefit workers, 
unions, and management?

need for environmentally responsible business and manufacturing processes, as the Operative 
Plasterers and Cement Masons International Association (OPCMIA) is doing, described in 
the “Going Green” feature. Unions can establish collaborative relationships with human 
resource managers and other management officials. And they can recognize the potential for 
prosperity for all—management and union workers included.
What’s Ahead
Treating employees well by enriching the work environment will continue to gain 
importance as a way to recruit and retain a highly motivated workforce. In addition, 
managers can tap the full potential of their employees by empowering them to make 
decisions, leading them to work effectively as teams, and fostering clear, positive 
communication. The next chapter covers these three means of improving performance. 
By involving employees more fully through empowerment, teamwork, and communication, 
companies can benefit from their knowledge while employees enjoy a more meaningful 
role in the company.

Summary of Learning Objectives
Explain the role and responsibilities of human resource 
management.
Human resource managers are responsible for attracting, 
developing, and retaining the employees who can perform 
the activities necessary to accomplish organizational 
objectives. They plan for staffing needs, recruit and hire 
workers, provide for training, evaluate performance, 
determine compensation and benefits, and oversee 
employee separation.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 What are the five main tasks of a human resource 
manager? The five main tasks are planning for staffing 
needs, recruiting and hiring workers, providing for training, 
and evaluating performance, determining compensation and 
benefits, and overseeing employee separation.
1.2 What are the three overall objectives of a human 
resource manager? The three overall objectives are 
providing qualified, well-trained employees for the organi-
zation; maximizing employee effectiveness; and satisfying 
individual employee needs through monetary compensation.
Describe how recruitment and selection contribute to 
placing the right person in a job.
Human resource managers use internal and external meth-
ods to recruit qualified employees. They may use college 
job fairs, personal referrals, want ads, and other resources. 
Internet recruiting is now the fastest, most efficient, and 
inexpensive way to reach a large pool of job seekers. 
Firms must abide by employment laws during selection 
in order to avoid lawsuits. Before hiring candidates, human 
resource managers may require employment tests that 
evaluate certain skills or aptitudes. When all of this is 
complete, there is a better chance that the right person 
will be hired for the job.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 Describe several recruiting techniques used 
by human resource managers. Techniques include 
college job fairs, personal referrals, want ads, company 
Web sites, online job sites, and online interviews such 
as jobcasts.
2.2 What is the function of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (EEOC)? The EEOC investi-
gates discrimination complaints and helps employers set up 
affirmative action programs.
 Discuss how orientation, training programs, and per-
formance appraisals help companies develop their 
employees.
New employees often participate in an orientation where 
they learn about company policies and practices. Training 
programs provide opportunities for employees to build their 
skills and knowledge and prepare them for new job opportu-
nities within the company. They also give employers a better 
chance of retaining employees. Performance appraisals give 
employees feedback about their strengths and weaknesses 
and how they can improve.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 What are the benefits of computer-based 
training? Computer-based training offers consistent 
presentations, interactive learning, and employees can learn 
at their own pace. It is also less expensive than other types 
of training.
3.2 What is a management development program? 
A management development program provides training 
designed to improve the skills and broaden the knowledge 
of current and potential executives.
3.3 What are the four criteria of an effective perfor-
mance appraisal? A performance appraisal should take 
place several times a year, be linked to organizational 
goals, be based on objective criteria, and be a two-way 
conversation.
Describe how firms compensate employees through pay 
systems and benefit programs.
Firms compensate employees with wages, salaries, incen-
tive pay systems, and benefits. Benefit programs vary among 
firms, but most companies offer healthcare programs, 
insurance, retirement plans, paid time off, and sick leave. 
A growing number of companies are offering flexible benefit 
plans and flexible work plans, such as flextime, compressed 
workweeks, job sharing, and home-based work.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 Explain the difference between wage and salary. 
Wages are based on an hourly pay rate or the amount of 
work accomplished. Salaries are paid periodically, such 
as weekly or monthly. Salaries do not fluctuate with hours 
worked.
4.2 What are flexible benefit plans? How do they work? 
Flexible benefit plans offer a choice of benefits, includ-
ing different types of medical insurance, dental and vision, 
and life and disability insurance. Typically, each employee 
receives a set allowance to pay for these benefits depending 
on his or her needs.
Discuss employee separation and the impact of downsiz-
ing and outsourcing.
Employee separation occurs when a worker leaves his or her 
job, voluntarily or involuntarily. Sometimes an employee is 
terminated because of poor job performance or unethical 
behavior. Downsizing is the process of reducing the number 
of employees within a firm in order to cut costs and achieve

a leaner organization. However, some negative effects 
include anxiety and lost productivity among remaining 
workers; expensive severance packages; and a domino effect 
in the local economy. Outsourcing involves transferring jobs 
from inside a firm to outside the firm. While some expenses 
may be cut, a firm may experience a backlash in perform-
ance and public image.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 What is the difference between voluntary and 
involuntary turnover? Voluntary turnover occurs when 
employees leave firms to start their own businesses, take 
jobs with other firms, move to another community, or 
retire. Involuntary turnover occurs because of poor job 
performance or unethical behavior in business practices or 
the workplace. It can also occur when a company is forced 
to eliminate jobs.
5.2 What is downsizing? How is it different from 
outsourcing? Downsizing is the process of reducing the 
number of employees within a firm by eliminating jobs. 
Downsizing is done to cut overhead costs and streamline the 
organizational structure. With outsourcing, companies con-
tract with other firms to perform noncore jobs or business 
functions, such as housekeeping, maintenance, or relocation 
services. This allows companies to focus on what they do 
best, and can result in a downsized workforce.
Explain the different methods and theories of 
motivation.
Employee motivation starts with high employee morale. 
According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, people satisfy 
lower-order needs (such as food and safety) before mov-
ing to higher-order needs (such as esteem and fulfillment). 
Herzberg’s two-factor model of motivation is based on 
the fulfillment of hygiene factors and motivation factors. 
Expectancy theory suggests that people use these factors 
to determine whether to put forth the effort to complete a 
task. Equity theory refers to a person’s perception of fair and 
equitable treatment. Goal-setting theory says that people 
will be motivated to the extent to which they accept specific, 
challenging goals. Job design is also used by managers for 
motivation.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 What are the four steps in the process of motiva-
tion? The four steps are need, motivation, goal-directed 
behavior, and need satisfaction.
6.2 Explain how goal setting works. People will be moti-
vated to the extent to which they accept specific, challeng-
ing goals and receive feedback that indicates their progress 
toward goal achievement.
6.3 Describe the three ways that managers structure 
jobs for increased motivation. Three ways that employ-
ers apply motivational theories to restructure jobs are job 
enlargement, job enrichment, and job rotation. Job enlarge-
ment is a job design that expands an employee’s responsi-
bilities by increasing the number and variety of tasks they 
entail. Job enrichment is a change in job duties to increase 
employees’ authority in planning their work, deciding how 
it should be done, and learning new skills that help them 
grow. Job rotation involves systematically moving employees 
from one job to another.
Discuss the role of labor unions, the collective bargain-
ing process, and methods for settling labor–management 
disputes.
Labor unions have resulted in the improvement of wages 
and working conditions for many workers over the past cen-
tury, along with the passage of significant labor laws. Unions 
achieve these improvements through the collective bargaining 
process, resulting in an agreement. Most labor–management 
disputes are settled through the grievance process, in which 
sometimes mediation or arbitration is necessary.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 What is a labor union? What is collective bargain-
ing? A labor union is a group of workers who have banded 
together to achieve common goals in the areas of wages, 
hours, and working conditions. Collective bargaining is 
the process of negotiation between management and union 
representatives.
7.2 What are the three main tactics used by unions to 
win support for their demands? Unions use strikes (walk-
outs), picketing, and boycotts.

The Coca-Cola Company: Training for the Future Right Now
Case 8.1
Coca-Cola is one of the most recognizable brands 
in the world—it has also stood the test of time, having 
survived more than 65 years. But the firm has come a long 
way from its first fizzy drink; it is now a global empire with 
products sold in more than 200 countries. The Coca-Cola 
Company maintains that the key to its success and longev-
ity isn’t its secret recipe for the famous cola in the red can; 
it’s the people behind the fizz. The company has become 
especially expert in two areas of human resource manage-
ment: wellness benefits and training. As a result, they 
employ healthy, skilled, and knowledgeable workers.
Several years ago, The Coca-Cola Company revamped 
its health and wellness programs so that they became 
an integral part of the firm’s overall strategy. “We now 
have a strategy in which our health care benefits and our 
wellness programs are mixed together,” explains Mary 
Williams, senior counsel of global compensation and bene-
fits. Prior to the new initiative, “we had no communication 
with the employee that having a healthy worker within our 
workforce was important to the company.”
The company now provides real incentives for 
employees to participate in its wellness programs. For 
example, one recent year they gave $120 to any worker 
who completed a wellness assessment. The following year, 
the company upped the ante, offering up to $180 to any 
employee who agreed to participate in health coaching. 
Fitness challenges, in which workers earn redeemable 
points for logging enough sleep at night or eating fruits 
and vegetables, are also included. Perhaps the most 
important part of the wellness effort is reaching employees 
with the right information, encouraging them to partici-
pate—there are now e-mail blasts and ads running on 
in-house television monitors, promoting wellness benefits. 
The new company mantra is “Live Positively,” observes 
Mary Williams.
Just as important as keeping employees healthy is 
the effort to train and educate them, preparing them for 
future innovations and leadership roles. A few years ago, 
the company founded Coca-Cola University (CCU) as part 
of an overall strategy to develop the global workforce to 
reach its greatest potential. “No longer can we think of 
career development as a step up in job grade or 
organization level, or of training as the sole source of 
skill development,” explains Katharine Nisbet, head of 
the management university. “Today, career development 
is about gathering critical experiences, necessary skills, 
and leadership capabilities that will be vital to the 
company’s and individual’s success today and in the 
future.”
Coca-Cola University operates on a 70-20-10 model 
of employee development. This means that 70 percent of 
learning takes place on the job, 20 percent occurs through 
coaching and mentoring, and 10 percent is acquired 
through formal, structured training. Within this model, 
The Coca-Cola Company human resource managers strive 
to match the right training to each worker’s needs. One 
employee might receive classroom teaching, online les-
sons, and on-the-job support while another might receive 
a different combination of training methods.
An important aspect of CCU’s management training 
strategy is that it encompasses everyone. “Our leader-
ship training applies to every Coca-Cola associate,” says 
Katharine Nisbet. “It is helping them build core competen-
cies such as innovation, collaboration, and teamwork.” 
Some of the seminars in which all staff are invited to par-
ticipate are: “Driving Innovative Business Improvements,” 
“Collaborating to Win,” and “Developing and Inspiring 
Others.” At their performance appraisal meetings, 
employees are encouraged to sign up for these and other 
offerings through CCU. This means that The Coca-Cola 
Company always has a deep pool from which to draw 
management talent that is already knowledgeable about 
the company’s strategies and objectives, now and for the 
future.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. In addition to cash payments, what other incen-
tives do you think might motivate The Coca-
Cola Company employees to participate in its 
wellness programs?
2. The Coca-Cola Company has developed a com-
prehensive, worldwide training program. In 
addition to increasing its leadership pool, what 
other positive effects do you predict this 
may have on the company’s future success?

CASE 1.2
Case 8.2
Strikes: Who Wins, Who Loses?
As a consumer, there are many strikes you’ll probably 
never notice. They won’t affect your daily life, what you 
eat, how you get to work or to school, or your access to 
communication and information. But a strike that stops 
a major form of transportation generally has the effect 
that its union wants: people notice. That was the case 
in Britain recently when union railworkers threatened to 
strike over a major holiday weekend during which thou-
sands of people were scheduled to travel by train.
The major issue leading to the strike vote was 
Network Rail’s announcement that it would be eliminat-
ing 1,500 jobs in an effort to cut costs. Network Rail, 
which is state owned, maintains the track and signaling 
system over which private train operating companies run 
their train services. It also hires out track engineering and 
replacement contracts to private contractors. The work-
ers involved in the dispute belong to the Rail Maritime 
Transport Workers Union (RMT). When RMT maintenance 
workers voted a 77 percent majority in favor of the strikes, 
Network Rail threatened to fire all 13,000 of them and 
reemploy a smaller number of them based on new terms 
and conditions. Because of budget cuts, a private sub-
contractor had already filed for bankruptcy—representing 
another 1,100 lost jobs.
Had the strike gone ahead as planned it would have 
been Britain’s first in more than 16 years.
It would have disrupted travel throughout the nation, 
including passenger travel and the shipping of goods. But 
the strike was blocked by a British judge who cited irregu-
larities in the union’s strike ballot—a technicality. Union 
representatives were outraged by the decision. “This judg-
ment is an attack on the whole trade union movement 
and twists the anti-union laws even further in favor of the 
bosses,” argued Bob Crow, general secretary for RMT. 
Network Rail’s head of operations, Robin Gisby, played to 
the general public. “This is good news for the millions of 
passengers who rely on us every day, and for our freight 
users and for the country as a whole,” he said. “We have 
a responsibility to our people to continue talking to the 
unions to find a settlement.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. If the RMT strike had gone ahead, 
what do you think might have been the result? 
How would the general public view RMT? How 
would Network Rail be viewed?
2. Do you think the union was a help or 
a hindrance to negotiations between workers 
and Network Rail? Why?

Seventh Generation Promotes Company Ownership
CASE 1.3
Case 8.3
Common sense dictates that companies who treat 
their employees well—from fair compensation to dignity 
in the workplace—will attract and retain the best workers. 
But from there, the picture becomes a bit murky. Traditional 
models of human resource management are being re-
evaluated and sometimes tossed out by firms whose goals 
and values these models do not fit. Seventh Generation 
is one such company. “When we win an award for being 
one of the best places to work in America, that to me is 
the most important award we can win because it’s the 
hardest thing we do,” says co-founder Jeffrey Hollender. 
Seventh Generation was founded on the premise of sus-
tainability—that every product it manufactures, whether it 
is laundry detergent or paper towels, must be designed and 
produced in such a way that it leaves little or no impact on 
the environment. Sustainability includes its recruitment and 
development of human resources over the long term.
Most of the 100-plus employees at Seventh 
Generation have had at least some experience with another 
employer. Hollender points out that these employees arrive 
at Seventh Generation with all of the relationship pat-
terns, values, and attitudes toward work they have learned 

Chapter 8  Human Resource Management: From Recruitment to Labor Relations
283
elsewhere. “Most businesses teach us not to have a voice, 
not to speak up, not to challenge authority, not to unleash 
the maximum potential we have as individuals,” he says. 
Because Seventh Generation incorporates a different set of 
values into its organizational culture, “the responsibility at 
Seventh Generation is to unteach people all of those habits 
and patterns, and unleash the potential that all of those 
other businesses have stifled,” Hollender asserts.
Stephanie Lowe works in human resources at Seventh 
Generation. She notes that when she was hired, the 
company had only 30 employees—now there are more 
than 100. The increase in the number of employees has 
presented a challenge. Not only have people arrived from 
other firms with a variety of experience and expectations, 
the logistics of managing 100 employees are different from 
those of managing 30. “We can’t do things as casually,” 
says Lowe with some regret. “Things just wouldn’t get 
done. It’s a hard line to walk, and it’s a challenge.” In addi-
tion, the core value of sustainability is built into every deci-
sion the firm makes. “How do you do compensation in a 
socially responsible company?” asks Lowe. “How do you do 
that in a company that values different things, where people 
are asked to value themselves and bring more of themselves 
to work?”
Seventh Generation’s answer to the compensation/
social responsibility/sustainability question is ownership. 
Every person who works at Seventh Generation has a 
financial stake in the company. “The most significant way 
Seventh Generation’s philosophy translates into HR is 
ownership,” remarks Hollender. He points out that a firm 
can give employees health insurance, time off, grants for 
the purchase of hybrid vehicles, on-site fitness centers, and 
the like; but none of these benefits translates to owner-
ship. “The most important thing is to let the people who 
are creating value by building the business participate in 
the value they create,” Hollender asserts.
Stephanie Lowe echoes this philosophy. “We aren’t 
trying to distinguish between the employees and the 
corporation,” she explains. At Seventh Generation, the 
people are the company. Employees not only participate 
in company ownership, they are viewed as contributors in 
ways that reach outside their job descriptions. “We are 
shifting away from traditional performance management to 
personal development plans,” says Lowe. “We do look at 
what employees need to work on to hit company goals, but 
also what each person needs to grow personally—and we 
let them define that.” Employees write personal initiatives 
that help the company recognize talents and potential that 
may not be readily evident during the performance of a 
particular job. “It’s based on the concept that you measure 
what you value,” explains Lowe. “We value volunteer time, 
making a difference in the world, raising more responsible 
global citizens.” To that end, Seventh Generation encour-
ages employees at every level to speak out with ideas for 
more sustainable products and processes.
When speaking about the Seventh Generation 
workforce, Hollender sounds more like a tribal elder than 
a business manager. Perhaps that’s no coincidence, as 
Seventh Generation’s mission is based on the Great Law of 
the Iroquois, which counsels each tribe member to consider 
the impact of all decisions on the next seven genera-
tions. “The thing I’m most proud of is the success of our 
employees at Seventh Generation,” boastsHollender, “their 
growth, the things they have thought of that I would never 
have dreamed of, the tough questions that they ask me 
that I wouldn’t ask myself. Unleashing that potential—that 
is the mostmagical thing about running a business.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Visit the Seventh Generation Web site at 
http://www.seventhgeneration.com and view 
the current job listings there. What kinds of 
qualities in job candidates does the firm look 
for that might be different from those at other 
companies?
2. What might be the potential benefits and 
pitfalls of Seventh Generation’s view of 
performance and compensation?
3. Choose one of the motivational theories 
described in the chapter and discuss how the 
theory would pertain to Seventh Generation’s 
approach to motivating employees.
4. Do you predict that employees at Seventh 
Generation will attempt to unionize? Why or 
why not? If they did, how do you think the firm 
would respond?

Top Performance through 
Empowerment, Teamwork, 
and Communication

 O  ne of the best things about actually going 
to the movies—aside from the popcorn, candy, 
and soda—is watching the trailers, clips, and 
celebrity interviews before the feature film. You can’t 
duplicate that experience with on-demand, TiVo, or 
a rented DVD. And while some moviegoers grumble 
about having to sit through the frills, there’s 
something fun about settling into your seat, tossing 
that first handful of popcorn into your mouth, and 
enjoying the free ride of entertainment before the 
main act.
That’s where Fandango comes in. Even the name 
is fun. Fandango was formed about ten years ago 
by seven of the largest movie houses in the United 
States with the mission of expanding the moviegoing 
experience for consumers who like to go out to 
the movies—perhaps enticing a few stay-at-home 
viewers to venture out as well. In addition to 
providing movie theaters with trailers, exclusive clips, 
celebrity interviews, fan reviews, and entertainment 
news, Fandango offers consumers the ability to buy 
movie tickets online in advance, to about 16,000 
screens nationwide.
Making moviegoing more fun requires creative, 
innovative, fun-loving people who can make 
quick decisions for the benefit of customers and 
whose ideas are appreciated and sought after by 
management. The career link on Fandango’s Web 
site poses the question, “Who are the Fandangos, 
you ask?” The site notes that among its employees 
are “surfers, break-dancers, comedians, writers, 
hockey players, gamers, oenophiles (wine lovers), 
and beauty pageant contestants.” Above all, 
Fandango’s employees love to entertain each other 
and their customers. “We believe that our success 
is not just about what we do, but also about how 
we do it.”
Teamwork is an important part of Fandango’s 
culture. Management promotes interaction among 
employees at every level, and encourages workers 
to get to know each other. Employees are expected 
to offer their thoughts and views. “Everyone’s 
contribution is valued, and they are encouraged to 
share ideas and opinions,” notes the site. Regular 
all-staff meetings keep the team informed of 
events, new offerings, and the ways in which their 
own efforts are contributing to Fandango’s overall 
goals. Chairman and CEO Chuck Davis is the man 
behind the Fandango team. He’s honed his team 
focus through his involvement with the American 
Youth Soccer Organization, where for many years 
he coached his son’s and daughter’s soccer teams. 
“You get to know every team and every family,” 
Davis says. In many ways, Davis is the head coach 
at Fandango.
Though Fandango was acquired by Comcast several 
years ago, Davis—who came to the company a year 
before its acquisition—has stayed on in his role as 
chief executive. He believes that every employee—
every team member—makes a difference to the 
organization’s success. “One weak link can crater 
the whole team,” Davis explains. “Teams win 
championships, not individuals.”1

Overview

Top managers like Chuck Davis at 
Fandango recognize that teamwork and 
communication are essential for empower-
ing employees to perform their best. This 
chapter focuses on how organizations 
involve employees by sharing information 
and empowering them to make critical deci-
sions, allowing them to work in teams, and 
fostering communication. We begin by 
discussing the ways managers can empower 
their employees’ decision-making author-
ity and responsibility. Then we explain why 
and how a growing number of firms rely on 
teams of workers rather than individuals to 
make decisions and carry out assignments. 
Finally, we discuss how effective communi-
cation allows workers to share information 
that improves the quality of decision making.
LECTURE ENHANCER: 
Have you ever had a job 
where teamwork was 
strongly emphasized?
Empowering Employees
An important component of effective management is the empowerment of employees. 
Managers promote this goal by giving employees the authority and responsibility to make 
decisions about their work. Empowerment seeks to tap the brainpower of all workers to find 
improved ways of doing their jobs, better serving customers, and achieving organizational 
goals. Empowerment frees managers from hands-on control of workers. It also motivates 
workers by adding challenges to their jobs and giving them a feeling of ownership. Managers 
empower employees by sharing company information and decision-making authority and 
by rewarding them for their performance—as well as the company’s. The topic of employee 
empowerment is discussed in the “Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature.
Sharing Information and Decision-Making Authority
One of the most effective methods of empowering employees is to keep them informed 
about the company’s financial performance. Companies such as Virginia-based engineer-
ing firm Anderson & Associates (A&A) provide regular reports to their employees on key 
financial information, such as profit-and-loss statements. A&A, which designs roads, water 
and sewer lines, and water-treatment facilities, posts financial statements, training schedules, 
policy documents, and other information on the company’s internal Web site. A&A practices 
open-book management—any employee can visit the site and look up the company’s cash 
flow, design standards, and photos of coworkers in other cities, as well as basic measures 
of financial performance. Like other companies that practice this strategy, A&A also trains 
its employees to interpret financial statements so that they can understand how their work 
contributes to company profits. Using information technology to empower employees does 
carry some risks. One is that information may reach competitors. Although A&A considered 
this problem, management decided that sharing information was essential to the company’s 
strategy.2

Many firms today recognize the benefits of empowering employees—
entrusting them with decision-making authority that may improve sales 
outcomes, relationships with customers, and the ultimate success of a 
firm. But not all managers are convinced that handing over the reins to 
their employees is the best way to run a company. They worry about the 
consequences of allowing employees to make decisions that could cost the 
company dearly if those choices turn out to be wrong.
Should fi rms empower employees to make decisions 
that could improve company relationships and over-
all performance?
Summary
While most firms are now practicing at least some degree of empowerment among employees, some 
managers are reluctant to delegate this kind of decision-making authority. However, even those managers 
who support empowerment agree that employees must be trained in decision-making skills and educated 
about the goods and services marketed by their firm. The company must create a cohesive message so all 
customers are treated equally and fairly by different employees. When it is implemented effectively, empow-
erment can be an important force in moving an organization forward.

PRO
1. Employees who are empowered to make decisions within their 
job descriptions and realm of expertise can help build relationships 
as well as sales. For example, an employee who has direct contact 
with customers can market products and solve customer problems 
more effectively if given the authority to do so. A salesperson who can 
authorize a return or a discount on the spot could cement a relation-
ship with a customer and ensure repeat business.
2. Empowered employees are motivated to increase their own per-
formance as well as that of the firm. Workers who are entrusted with 
making decisions about their own jobs are more invested in their com-
pany’s overall performance. Employees who are motivated to display 
the commitment, initiative, and creativity that decision-making requires 
help propel their company to success.
CON
1. When things go wrong at a firm—such as a major product 
recall or the discovery of poor working conditions at an outsourced 
facility—customers, investors, and the public turn their attention 
immediately to the company’s leadership. If the company’s top man-
agement appears unaware of the decision making that led to these 
mistakes, then customers, investors, and the public quickly lose faith in 
the firm’s credibility. Employee decision making can result in this type 
of communication breakdown within an organization.
2. When employees are empowered without proper training, cus-
tomers or suppliers might receive insufficient or inaccurate information 
that could lead to failed solutions, damaged relationships, and lost 
sales. 
Employee Empowerment: Yes or No?
The second way in which companies empower employees is to give them broad author-
ity to make workplace decisions that implement a firm’s vision and its competitive strategy. 
Even among non-management staff, empowerment extends to decisions and activities tra-
ditionally handled by managers. Employees might be responsible for such tasks as purchas-
ing supplies, making hiring decisions, scheduling production or work hours, overseeing the 
safety program, and granting pay increases.
This can be an especially powerful tool in many healthcare environments. At Lebanon 
Valley Brethren Homes, a long-term care facility in Pennsylvania, workers at all levels

are empowered to do whatever it takes to 
improve the quality of their elderly resi-
dents’ lives. Each care worker attends to 
the same residents every day, so caregivers 
and residents form a strong personal bond. 
Caregivers are responsible for the overall 
management of their household includ-
ing meals and housekeeping. They make 
decisions for individual residents ranging 
from sleep schedules to room lighting. As 
a result, each Green House—or household 
within the larger community—feels like a 
home.3
Empowerment can take other forms as 
well. GM recently announced an initiative 
in which GM workers could volunteer to 
take vehicles home and test drive them in 
real-life situations, as described in the “Hit 
& Miss” feature.
Linking Rewards to Company Performance
Perhaps the ultimate step in convincing employees of their stake in the prosperity of 
their firm is worker ownership. Two widely used ways that companies provide worker own-
ership are employee stock ownership plans and stock options. Table 9.1 compares these two 
methods of employee ownership.
Employee Stock Ownership Plans Almost 13 million workers participate 
in 10,500 employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) worth more than $900 billion.4 These plans 
benefit employees by giving them ownership stakes in their companies, leading to potential

There are lots of things that autoworkers at GM are used to doing 
as part of their jobs—operating machinery, running computer pro-
grams, managing schedules and logistics. But until recently, there’s one 
thing GM workers hadn’t been asked to do; at least, not to the extent 
they are now: drive the cars.
Workers at the GM assembly plant in Arlington, Texas, were 
recently given the chance to volunteer for a new program in which they 
could literally “check out” a vehicle from the plant lot, take it home for 
a night or a weekend, and drive it just as they would their own car or 
cross-over SUV. In return, the test drivers were asked for detailed feed-
back about the vehicles, for the first time giving them a powerful voice 
in the design and construction of the cars they spend hours and weeks 
building. “We had so much interest in [the program] we had to use a 
lottery to determine who would get to be a volunteer,” reports Enrique 
Flores Jr., president of the United Auto Workers Local 276, the union 
representing 2,400 workers at the GM plant.
While the test-drive idea isn’t new—executives and managers 
have participated in it for years—bringing the program to rank-and-file 
workers represents an updated attitude toward empowering employ-
ees. “We want to engage employees to do underground marketing,” 
explains Wendy Stachowicz, coordinator of the GM Vehicle Advocate 
Program. “You look at where the company has been and where it has 
to go. Everyone has to help.”
In addition to a lottery, employees were selected based on their 
driving records. If they chose to purchase that vehicle or another one in 
the program, they qualified for discounts that reduced the price to near 
wholesale level. But participants didn’t receive commissions or other 
rewards for test driving the cars—that wasn’t the point. “This is a tool 
to empower people, to get them really engaged with our products,” 
explains Stachowicz. Next, GM is considering expanding the program 
to include GM retirees and suppliers.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. In what ways does the GM test-drive program empower 
workers?
2. How might GM benefit from this type of empowerment 
of its assembly plant workers?

GM: Putting Workers in the Driver’s Seat
Hit 
profits as the value of their firm increases. Under ESOPs, the employer buys shares 
of the company stock on behalf of the employee as a retirement benefit. The accounts 
continue to grow in value tax-free, and when employees leave the company, they can cash 
in their stock shares. Employees are motivated to work harder and smarter than they would 
without ESOPs because, as part owners, they share in their firm’s financial success. About 
60 percent of companies surveyed that offer ESOPs report an increase in employee 
productivity.5
As retirement plans, ESOPs must comply with government regulations designed to 
protect pension benefits. Because ESOPs can be expensive to set up, they are more common 
in larger firms than in smaller ones. Public companies with ESOPs average around 14,000 
employees, while private companies average about 1,500 employees.6 One danger with 
ESOPs is that if the majority of an employee’s retirement funds are in company stock and 
the value falls dramatically, the employee may be financially harmed.7
Stock Options Another popular way for companies to share ownership with their 
employees is through the use of stock options, or rights to buy a specified amount of com-
pany stock at a given price within a given time period. In contrast to an ESOP, in which the 
company holds stock for the benefit of employees, stock options give employees a chance to 
own the stock themselves if they exercise their options by completing the stock purchase. If 
an employee receives an option on 100 shares at $10 per share and the stock price goes up 
to $20, the employee can exercise the option to buy those 100 at $10 each, sell them at the 
market price of $20, and keep the difference. If the stock price never goes above the option 
price, the employee isn’t required to exercise the option.8
CLASS ACTIVITY: 
Ask students to provide and 
discuss the pros and cons of 
stock options. 

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
290
Although options were once limited to senior executives and members of the board of 
directors, some companies now grant stock options to employees at all levels. Federal labor 
laws allow stock options to be granted to both hourly and salaried employees. It is esti-
mated that 9 million employees in thousands of companies hold stock options.9 About 
one-third of all stock options issued by U.S. corporations go to the top five executives at 
each firm. Much of the remainder goes to other executives and managers, who make up 
only about 2 percent of the U.S. workforce. Yet there is solid evidence that stock options 
motivate regular employees to perform better. Some argue that to be most effective 
as motivators, stock options need to be granted to a much broader base of employees. 
Stock options have turned hundreds of employees at firms such as Home Depot, 
Microsoft, and Google into millionaires. But such success stories are no guarantee, especially 
when stock prices drop during economic downturns. As with ESOPs, employees face risks 
when they rely on a single company’s stock to provide for them. In addition to stock options 
and ESOPs, many firms offer their executives other perks, or special privileges. 
Teams
A team is a group of people with certain skills who are committed to a common pur-
pose, approach, and set of performance goals. All team members hold themselves mutually 
responsible and accountable for accomplishing their objectives. Teams are widely used in 
business and in many not-for-profit organizations such as hospitals and government agencies. 
Teams are one of the most frequently discussed 
topics in employee training programs, because 
teams require that people learn how to work 
effectively together. Many firms emphasize the 
importance of teams during their hiring processes, 
asking job applicants about their previous experi-
ences as team members. Why? Because companies 
want to hire people who can work well with other 
people and pool their talents and ideas to achieve 
more together than they could achieve working 
alone. Figure 9.1 outlines five basic types of teams: 
work teams, problem-solving teams, self-managed 
teams, cross-functional teams, and virtual teams.
About two-thirds of U.S. firms currently use 
work teams, which are relatively permanent 
groups of employees. In this approach, people 
with complementary skills perform the day-to-
day work of the organization. A work team might 
include all the workers involved in assembling 
and packaging a product—it could be anything 
from cupcakes to cars. Most of Walmart’s major 
vendors maintain offices near its headquarters 
in Bentonville, Arkansas. Typically, the vendor 
offices operate as work teams, and the head of 
these vendor offices often has the title of “team 
leader.”

In contrast to work teams, a problem-solving team is a temporary combination of 
workers who gather to solve a specific problem and then disband. They differ from work 
teams in important ways, though. Work teams are permanent units designed to handle any 
business problem that arises, but problem-solving teams pursue specific missions. When 
Toyota was faced with serious quality problems—unintended acceleration, faulty brakes, 
and then questions about tires—and was forced to recall thousands of vehicles, the company 
formed Rapid Response Swift Market Analysis Response Teams (SMART) to deal with the 
technical problems. SMART were made up of field technology specialists, engineers from 
manufacturing and design, and product engineers from the United States with specialists 
from Japan on call. Together team members worked with dealers across the country to con-
tact customers and arrange for on-site analyses of each problem vehicle to determine what 
went wrong and why. Teams were encouraged to “listen and react” to customers’ descrip-
tions of their experiences as part of their investigation.10 Typically when a problem is solved, 
the team disbands—but in some cases, the team may develop a more permanent role 
within the firm.
A work team empowered with the authority to decide how its members complete their 
daily tasks is called a self-managed team. A self-managed team works most effectively 
when it combines employees with a range of skills and functions. Members are cross-trained 
to perform each other’s jobs as needed. Distributing decision-making authority in this way 
can free members to concentrate on satisfying customers. Whole Foods Market has a 
structure based on self-managed work teams. Company managers decided that Whole 
Foods could be most innovative if employees made decisions themselves. Every employee 
is part of a team, and each store has about ten teams handling separate functions, such as 
groceries, bakery, and customer service. Each team handles responsibilities related to setting 
goals, hiring and training employees, scheduling team members, and purchasing goods to 
stock. Teams meet at least monthly to review goals and performance, solve problems, and 
explore new ideas. Whole Foods awards bonuses based on the teams’ performance relative 
to their goals.11
A team made up of members from different func-
tions, such as production, marketing, and finance, is 
called a cross-functional team. Most often, cross-
functional teams work on specific problems or projects, 
but they can also serve as permanent work team arrange-
ments. The value of cross-functional teams comes from 
their ability to bring different perspectives—as well as 
different types of expertise—to a work effort. At Harley-
Davidson, cross-functional teams are working to find 
new ways to enhance the unique sound of its motorcycles 
while reducing unwanted noise. “We’re aggressively 
moving from a tribal way of working to a cross-functional 
approach,” notes Alex Bozmoski, manager of the cross-
functional teams.12
Virtual teams are groups of geographically or 
organizationally dispersed coworkers who use a combina-
tion of telecommunications and information technologies 
to accomplish an organizational task. Because of the 
availability of e-mail, videoconferencing, and group 
communication software, members of virtual teams rarely 
meet face-to-face. The principal advantage of virtual

Although members of a virtual team rarely meet in person, they stay in 
touch through new technologies, like videoconferencing. In today’s global 
marketplace, the flexibility of virtual teams is a distinct advantage.

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business

teams is that they are very flexible. Employees can work with each other regardless of physical 
location, time zone, or organizational affiliation. Because of their very nature, virtual teams 
that are scattered across the globe can be difficult to manage. But firms that are committed to 
them believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.
Team Characteristics
Effective teams share a number of characteristics. They must be an appropriate size to 
accomplish their work. In addition to size, teams also can be categorized according to the 
similarities and differences among team members, called level and diversity. We discuss these 
three characteristics next.
Team Size
Teams can range in size from as small as 2 people to as large as 150 people. In practice, 
however, most teams have fewer than 12 members. Although no ideal size limit applies to every 
team, research on team effectiveness indicates that they achieve their best results with about 
6 or 7 members. A group of this size is big enough to benefit from a variety of diverse skills, 
yet small enough to allow members to communicate easily and feel part of a close-knit group.
Certainly, groups smaller or larger than this can be effective, but they also create added 
challenges for team leaders. Participants in small teams of two to four members often show a 
desire to get along with each other. They tend to favor informal interactions marked by dis-
cussions of personal topics, and they make only limited demands on team leaders. A large team 
with more than 12 members poses a different challenge for team leaders because decision mak-
ing may work slowly and participants may feel less committed to team goals. Larger teams also 
tend to foster disagreements, absenteeism, and membership turnover. Subgroups may form, 
leading to possible conflicts among various 
functions. As a general rule, a team of more 
than 20 people should be divided into sub-
teams, each with its own members and goals.
Team Level and Team 
Diversity
Team level is the average level of ability, 
experience, personality, or any other factor on 
a team. Businesses consider team level when 
they need teams with a particular set of skills 
or capabilities to do their jobs well. For exam-
ple, an environmental engineering firm might 
put together a team with a high level of expe-
rience to write a proposal for a large contract.
While team level represents the average 
level or capability on a team, team diversity 
represents the differences in ability, experi-
ence, personality, or any other factor on a

teams that must complete a wide range of different tasks or particularly complex tasks. For

events such as the FIFA World Cup or the Olympic Games.

Ernst & Young has seen it all—economic booms and busts, includ-
ing the recent recession and fallout from the financial industry. But the 
company that provides tax, transaction, and advisory services is surviv-
ing, partly due to a new outlook about the business environment and 
the way it will operate going forward. One focus will be ways in which 
its 144,000 employees can contribute their talents more fully to the 
company’s future. 
Specifically, Ernst & Young is redefining the way it uses teams. 
A recent company survey entitled, “The New Global Mindset: Driving 
Innovation Through Diverse Perspective,” revealed that companies 
operating in 25 or more countries base only 5 percent of their senior 
leadership in those countries. These companies are failing to make 
the most of the diverse cultures and ideas that could propel them for-
ward. “The economic crisis has mandated that companies rethink the 
way they do business,” observes James S. Turley, chairman and CEO 
of Ernst & Young. “Company leaders need to consider how a lack of 
diverse perspectives—at the top of their organization and at the indi-
vidual team level—might affect plans for global growth, new products, 
or mergers and acquisitions.”
So Ernst & Young has come up with a blueprint of thought behind 
its new team diversity. Managers who are planning or leading teams 
should consider the following:
 •
The mindset. Managers must think about what has to happen in 
order for a true cultural change to occur within the organization.
 •
The talent. Managers should search every corner of the organization 
for true talent—it might be in the cafeteria, at an assistant’s desk, 
or in the human resources office.
 •
Anticipation. Creative managers need to use the diverse talents of 
team members to identify new products and services that could be 
the next “big thing.”
 •
Consensus. Total agreement among team members isn’t always 
necessary—or even the best thing. In fact, disagreement can 
boost a team’s energy and force people to come up with new and 
better ideas and solutions.
“We all know that innovation is critical to economic recovery,” 
says Beth Brooke, global vice chair of Ernst & Young. “In today’s envi-
ronment, the business leaders who have a truly global mindset and can 
integrate diverse perspectives will be the ones best positioned to drive 
innovation and long-term success.”

Team Diversity at Ernst & Young
Hit 
team. Strong teams not only have talented members—as demonstrated by their team level—
but also members who are different in terms of ability, experience, or personality. Team 
diversity is an important consideration for teams that must complete a wide range of differ-
ent tasks or particularly complex tasks. For instance, the British Broadcasting Corporation 
(BBC) routinely creates teams for a variety of events such as the FIFA World Cup or the 
Olympic Games. These teams involve production and broadcast groups larger than 100 
people, many of whom are part-time employees. Team members typically come from more 
than 15 different countries, with skills ranging from electrician to statistician, or from sched-
uling to producing. And because an event at any of the sports venues only takes place once, 
the BBC teams have one chance to get it right.13 Ernst & Young, a global firm that provides 
financial services, relies on team diversity, as described in the “Hit & Miss” feature.
Stages of Team Development
Teams typically progress through five stages of development: forming, storming, norm-
ing, performing, and adjourning. Although not every team passes through each of these 
stages, those teams that do are usually better performers. These stages are summarized in 
Figure 9.2.
CLASS ACTIVITY: 
Ask students to describe 
the possible challenges of 
working on a diverse team.

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
294
Stage 1: Forming The forming is an orien-
tation period during which team members get to know 
each other and find out what behaviors are acceptable 
to the group. Team members begin with curiosity 
about expectations of them and whether they will fit in 
with the group. An effective team leader provides time 
for members to become acquainted.
Stage 2: Storming The personalities 
of team members begin to emerge at the storming 
stage, as members clarify their roles and expectations. 
Conflicts may arise, as people disagree over the team’s 
mission and jockey for position and control of the 
group. Subgroups may form based on common inter-
ests or concerns. At this stage, the team leader must 
encourage everyone to participate, allowing members 
to work through their uncertainties and conflicts. 
Teams must move beyond this stage to achieve real 
productivity.
Stage 3: Norming During the norming 
stage, members resolve differences, accept each other, 
and reach broad agreement about the roles of the team 
leader and other participants. This stage is usually 
brief, and the team leader should use it to emphasize 
the team’s unity and the importance of its objectives.
Stage 4: Performing While performing, members focus on solving problems and 
accomplishing tasks. They interact frequently and handle conflicts in constructive ways. The 
team leader encourages contributions from all members. He or she should attempt to get any 
non-participating team members involved.
Stage 5: Adjourning The team adjourns after members have completed their 
assigned task or solved the problem. During this phase, the focus is on wrapping up and 
summarizing the team’s experiences and accomplishments. The team leader may recognize 
the team’s accomplishments with a celebration, perhaps handing out plaques or awards.
Team Cohesiveness and Norms
Teams tend to maximize productivity when they form into highly cohesive units. Team 
cohesiveness is the extent to which members feel attracted to the team and motivated to 
remain part of it. This cohesiveness typically increases when members interact frequently, 
share common attitudes and goals, and enjoy being together. Cohesive groups have a bet-
ter chance of retaining their members than those that do not achieve cohesiveness. As a 
result, cohesive groups typically experience lower turnover. In addition, team cohesiveness 
promotes cooperative behavior, generosity, and a willingness on the part of team members 
to help each other. When team cohesiveness is high, team members are more motivated to 
contribute to the team, because they want the approval of other team members.

Not surprisingly, studies have clearly established that cohesive teams quickly achieve high 
levels of performance and consistently perform better.
Team-building retreats are one way to encourage cohesiveness and improve satisfaction 
and retention. Gulf Coast Community Foundation of Venice, Florida, uses team retreats, 
where members participate in team-building exercises and games. “We are getting away 
from the office and having people get to know each other on a human level,” says CEO Teri 
Hansen. She notes that the bonds created on these retreats return with team members to the 
workplace.14 Many approaches to training teams also emphasize building cohesion through 
techniques like cross-training team members in each others’ roles or training team members 
to develop the skills needed to support the team task.15
A team norm is a standard of conduct shared by team members that guides their behav-
ior. Norms are not formal written guidelines; they are informal standards that identify key 
values and clarify team members’ expectations. In highly productive teams, norms contribute 
to constructive work and the accomplishment of team goals. In Illinois, the Rockford Public 
Schools and Rock Valley College recently formed an alliance to create work teams of high 
school teachers and college faculty members to draft recommendations for the alignment 
of coursework so high school students would be better prepared to attend college.16 In this 
case, team norms would include standards of conduct during meetings as well as a shared 
vision for the preparation of students.
Team Conﬂ ict
Conflict occurs when one person or group’s needs do not match those of another, 
and attempts may be made to block the opposing side’s intentions or goals. Conflict and 
disagreement are inevitable in most teams. But this shouldn’t surprise anyone. People who 
work together are naturally going to disagree about what and how things are done. What 
causes conflict in teams? Although almost anything can lead to conflict—casual remarks 
that unintentionally offend a team member or fighting over scarce resources—the primary 
cause of team conflict is disagreement over goals and priorities. Other common causes of 
team conflict include disagreements over task-related issues, interpersonal incompatibilities, 
simple fatigue, and team diversity.
Earlier in this chapter we noted how teams can experience diversity among members. 
While diversity brings stimulation, challenge, and energy, it can also lead to conflict. The 
job of the manager is to create an environment in which differences are appreciated and in 
which a team of diverse individuals works productively together. Diversity awareness train-
ing programs can reduce conflict by bringing these differences out in the open and identify-
ing the unique talents of diverse individuals.
Although most people think conflict should be avoided, management experts note that 
conflict can actually enhance team performance. The key to dealing with conflict is mak-
ing sure that the team experiences the right kind of conflict. Cognitive conflict focuses on 
problem-related differences of opinion, and reconciling these differences strongly improves 
team performance. With cognitive conflict, team members disagree because their differ-
ent experiences and expertise lead them to different views of the problem and its solutions. 
Cognitive conflict is also characterized by a willingness to examine, compare, and reconcile 
differences to produce the best possible solution. By contrast, affective conflict refers to 
the emotional reactions that can occur when disagreements become personal rather than 
professional, and these differences strongly decrease team performance. Because affective

conflict often results in hostility, anger, resentment, distrust, cynicism, and apathy, it can 
make people uncomfortable, cause them to withdraw, decrease their commitment to a team, 
lower the satisfaction of team members, and decrease team cohesiveness. So, unlike cognitive 
conflict, affective conflict undermines team performance by preventing teams from engaging 
in activities that are critical to team effectiveness.
What can managers do to manage team conflict—and even make it work for them? 
Perhaps the team leader’s most important contribution to conflict resolution can 
be facilitating good communication so that teammates respect each other and are free to 
disagree with each other. Ongoing, effective communication ensures that team members 
perceive each other accurately, understand what is expected of them, and obtain the 
information they need. Taking this a step further, organizations should evaluate situations 
or conditions in the workplace that might be causing conflict. Solving a single conflict isn’t 
helpful if there are problems systemic to the team or to the company. Team-building 
exercises, listening exercises, and role-playing can help employees learn to become better 
team members.17
The Importance of 
Effective Communication
Countries like China, India, and Mexico are home to businesses that provide goods and 
services to companies or consumers in the United States. But the more parties involved in 
the production process, the harder it is to coordinate communication. Japanese Toyota found 
itself in a whirlpool of miscommunication as it tried to document a consistent timeline for 
the discovery and reporting of unintended acceleration in a number of its vehicles worldwide. 
While speculation about the cause—loose floor mats, stuck gas pedals, and electronics—
raged, U.S. officials learned that European dealers had received information and repair kits 
from Toyota months earlier.18
Communication can be defined as a meaningful exchange of information through 
messages. Few businesses can succeed without effective communication. In fact, as 
illustrated by the Toyota example, miscommunication can result in damage to the com-
pany. Toyota was ordered to pay a record-breaking $16.4 million in fines for its failure to 
communicate.19 
Managers spend about 80 percent of their time—6 hours and 24 minutes of every eight-
hour day—in direct communication with others, whether on the telephone, in meetings, via 
e-mail, or in individual conversations. Company recruiters consistently rate effective com-
munication, such as listening, conversing, and giving feedback, as the most important skill 
they look for when hiring new employees. In this last half of the chapter, you’ll learn about 
the communication process, the basic forms of communication, and ways to improve com-
munication within organizations.
The Process of Communication
Every communication follows a step-by-step process that involves interactions among six 
elements: sender, message, channel, audience, feedback, and context. This process is illus-
trated in Figure 9.3.

297
In the first step, the sender composes the 
message and sends it through a communica-
tion carrier, or channel. Encoding a message 
means that the sender translates its meaning 
into understandable terms and a form that 
allows transmission through a chosen chan-
nel. The sender can communicate a particular 
message through many different channels, 
including face-to-face conversations, phone 
calls, and e-mail or texting. A promotional 
message to the firm’s customers may be com-
municated through such forms as radio and 
television ads, billboards, magazines and 
newspapers, sales presentations, and social 
media such as Facebook and Twitter. The 
audience consists of the people who receive 
the message. In decoding, the receiver of the 
message interprets its meaning. Feedback from the audience—in response to the sender’s 
communication—helps the sender determine whether the audience has correctly interpreted 
the intended meaning of the message.
Every communication takes place in some sort of situational or cultural context. The 
context can exert a powerful influence on how well the process works. A conversation 
between two people in a quiet office, for example, may be a very different experience from 
the same conversation held at a noisy party. An American who orders chips in an English 
tavern will receive French fries. 
Anthropologists classify cultures as low context and high context. Communication in 
low-context cultures tends to rely on explicit written and verbal messages. Examples include 
Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and the United States. In contrast, communication in high-
context cultures—such as those of Japan, Latin America, and India—depends not only on the 
message itself but also on the conditions that surround it, including nonverbal cues, past and 
present experiences, and personal relationships between the parties. Westerners must care-
fully temper their low-context style to the expectations of colleagues and clients from high-
context countries. Although Americans tend to favor direct interactions and want to “get 
down to business” soon after shaking hands or sitting down to a business dinner, business-
people in Mexico and Asian countries prefer to become acquainted before discussing details. 
When conducting business in these cultures, wise visitors allow time for relaxed meals dur-
ing which business-related topics are avoided.
Senders must pay attention to audience feedback, even requesting it if none is forthcom-
ing, because this response clarifies whether the communication has conveyed the intended 
message. Feedback can indicate whether the receiver heard the message and was able to 
decode it accurately. Even when the receiver tries to understand, the communication may 
fail if the message contained jargon or ambiguous words.
Noise during the communication process is some type of interference that influences 
the transmission of messages and feedback. Noise can result from simple physical 
factors such as poor reception of a cell phone message or static that drowns out a radio 
commercial. It can also be caused by more complex differences in people’s attitudes and 
perceptions. Consequently, even when people are exposed to the same communications, 
they can end up with very different perceptions and understandings because of communica-
tion noise.

Noise can be present at any point in the 
communication process. This is why manag-
ers must learn how to cut through noise when 
communicating with employees. Managers 
at i-level, a digital communications agency, 
found a creative way to cut through noise 
to communicate its plans to transition from 
a paper-based benefits process to an online 
system. First they distributed “i” character 
mugs to office staff. Then they sent messages 
to employees’ mobile phones. Those with 
iPhones received animated messages. New 
hires and prospective employees without com-
pany phones received a USB stick with the 
messages. “The communications felt really 
innovative and it was good using digital media 
because at the end of the day, that’s what 
we’re about as a company,” says James Miller, 
the company’s human resource director. 
“People have found it really good fun and I’m 
really, really pleased with the concept we have 
come up with.”20
Basic Forms of Communication
Managers and coworkers communicate in many different ways—by making a phone call, 
sending an e-mail, holding a staff meeting, or chatting in the hallway. They also communi-
cate with facial expressions, gestures, and other body language. Subtle variations can signifi-
cantly influence the reception of a message. As Table 9.2 points out, communication takes 
various forms: oral and written, formal and informal, and nonverbal.
Oral Communication
Managers spend a lot of time engaged in oral communication, both in person and on the 
phone. Some people prefer to communicate this way, believing that oral channels more accu-
rately convey messages. Face-to-face oral communication allows people to combine words 
with such cues as facial expressions and tone of voice. Oral communication over the tele-
phone lacks visual cues, but it does allow people to hear the tone of voice and provide imme-
diate feedback by asking questions or restating the message. Because of its immediacy, oral 
communication has drawbacks. If one person is agitated or nervous during a conversation, 
noise enters the communication process. A hurried manager might brush off an employee 
who has an important message to deliver. A frustrated employee might feel compelled to fire 
a harsh retort at an unsupportive supervisor instead of thinking before responding.
In any medium, a vital component of oral communication is listening—receiving a 
message and interpreting its genuine meaning by accurately grasping the facts and feeling 
conveyed. Although listening may be the most important communication skill, most of us 
don’t use it enough—or as well as we should.

Noise during the communication process can result from simple physical factors such 
as poor reception of a cell phone message or static that drowns out a radio 
commercial. Consequently, even when people are exposed to the same communications, 
they may end up with very different perceptions and understandings because of 
communication noise.

Listening may seem easy, because the listener appears to make no effort. But the aver-
age person talks at a rate of roughly 150 words per minute, while the brain can handle up to 
400 words per minute. This gap can lead to boredom, inattention, and misinterpretation. In 
fact, immediately after listening to a message, the average person can recall only half of it. 
After several days, the proportion of a message that a listener can recall falls to 25 percent 
or less.
Certain types of listening behaviors are common in both business and personal 
interactions:
 • Cynical or defensive listening. This type of listening occurs when the receiver of a message 
feels that the sender is trying to gain some advantage from the communication.
 • Offensive listening. In this type of listening, the receiver tries to catch the speaker in a 
mistake or contradiction.
 • Polite listening. In this mechanical type of listening, the receiver listens to be polite rather 
than to contribute to communication. Polite listeners are usually inattentive and spend 
their time rehearsing what they want to say when the speaker finishes.
 • Active listening. This form of listening requires involvement with the information and 
empathy with the speaker’s situation. In both business and personal life, active listening 
is the basis for effective communication.
Learning how to be an active listener is an especially important goal for business leaders 
because effective communication is essential to their role. Listening is hard work, but it pays 
off with increased learning, better interpersonal relationships, and greater influence.21 Both 
managers and employees can develop skills to make them better listeners, as described in the 
“Business Etiquette” feature.

Written Communication
Channels for written communication 
include reports, letters, memos, online 
discussion boards and social media, e-mails, 
and text messages. Many of these channels 
permit only delayed feedback and create a 
record of the message. So it is important 
for the sender of a written communica-
tion to prepare the message carefully and 
review it to avoid misunderstandings—
particularly before pressing that “send” 
button.
Effective written communication 
reflects its audience, the channel carrying 
the message, and the appropriate degree of 
formality. When writing a formal business 
document such as a complex marketing 
research report, a manager must plan in 
advance and carefully construct the docu-
ment. The process of writing a formal 
document involves planning, research, 
organization, composition and design, and 
revision. Written communication via e-mail may call for a less-formal writing style, includ-
ing short sentences, phrases, and lists.
E-mail is a very effective communication channel, especially for delivering straightfor-
ward messages and information. But e-mail’s effectiveness also leads to its biggest problem: 
too much e-mail! Many workers find their valuable time being consumed with e-mail. To 
relieve this burden and leave more time for performing the most important aspects of the 
job, some companies are looking into ways to reduce the time employees spend sending and 
reading e-mail. To fulfill this need, there are now firms that provide e-mail management 
services. One such company is DakotaPro.biz, which provides customized e-mail solutions 
for firms that have been struggling to keep up with the volume of e-mail they receive and 
the time it takes to operate an in-house server.22
Other e-mail issues are security and retention. Because e-mail messages are often infor-
mal, senders occasionally forget that they are creating a written record. Even if the recipient 
deletes an e-mail message, other copies exist on company e-mail servers. E-mails on com-
pany servers can be used as evidence in a legal case or disciplinary action. 
Formal Communication
A formal communication channel carries messages that flow within the chain of command 
structure defined by an organization. The most familiar channel, downward communica-
tion, carries messages from someone who holds a senior position in the organization to sub-
ordinates. Managers may communicate downward by sending employees e-mail messages, 
presiding at department meetings, giving employees policy manuals, posting notices on 
bulletin boards, and reporting news in company newsletters. The most important factor in

Tune Up Your Listening Skills
Smart managers know that good listening is an important key to business 
success. Tuning in to employees, customers, and competitors can provide a 
wealth of valuable insight and information. Listening means paying attention 
to verbal and nonverbal cues. It means turning off your cell phone during a 
face-to-face conversation or meeting. It involves strategies for understanding 
the message that is conveyed. Here are a few tips for enhancing your 
listening skills:
 • Be attentive. If culturally appropriate, maintain eye contact with the 
speaker—without staring. Nod your head to convey that you are hearing 
the person. Screen out distractions like background noise and irrelevant 
thoughts.
 • Keep an open mind. Hear the other person all the way through, even if you 
are certain you will disagree. This not only shows respect for the speaker, 
it will result in your own informed reply.
 • Don’t interrupt. Even if you are absolutely certain of what the person is 
going to say—or convinced you have a solution or answer—wait until 
the speaker is ﬁ nished. Then you can ask a question or make your point.
 • Ask questions. Ask at least one question or paraphrase portions of the 
speaker’s discussion to ensure that you understand the other person’s 
point.
 • Be empathetic. Laugh or be consoling where appropriate. You don’t have to 
agree with the speaker, but even in the heat of disagreement, you can 
show empathy.

formal communication is to be open and honest. 
“Spinning” bad news to make it look better almost 
always backfires. In a work environment 
characterized by open communication, employees 
feel free to express opinions, offer suggestions, and 
even voice complaints. Research has shown that 
open communication has the following seven 
characteristics:
1.  Employees are valued. Employees are happier 
and more motivated when they feel they are 
valued and their opinions are heard.
2. A high level of trust exists. Telling the truth 
maintains a high level of trust; this forms 
the foundation for open communication and 
employee motivation and retention.
3. Conflict is invited and resolved positively. Without 
conflict, innovation and creativity are stifled.
4. Creative dissent is welcomed. By expressing 
unique ideas, employees feel they have con-
tributed to the company and improved perfor-
mance.
5. Employee input is solicited. The key to any 
company’s success is input from employees, 
which establishes a sense of involvement and 
improves working relations.
6. Employees are well informed. Employees are kept 
informed about what is happening within the 
organization.
7. Feedback is ongoing. Both positive and negative 
feedback must be ongoing and provided in a 
manner that builds relationships rather than 
assigns blame.23
Many firms also define formal channels 
for upward communications. These channels 
encourage communication from employees to 
supervisors and upward to top management 
levels. Some examples of upward communication 
channels are employee surveys, suggestion 
boxes, and systems that allow employees to 
propose ideas for new products or voice com-
plaints. Upward communication is also necessary 
for managers to evaluate the effectiveness 
of downward communication. Figure 9.4 illus-
trates the forms of organizational communication, 
both formal and informal.

Informal Communication
Informal communication channels carry messages outside formally authorized channels 
within an organization’s hierarchy. A familiar example of an informal channel is the 
grapevine, an internal channel that passes information from unofficial sources. All orga-
nizations, large or small, have grapevines. Grapevines disseminate information with speed 
and economy and are surprisingly reliable. But company communications must be managed 
effectively so that the grapevine is not the main source of information. When properly nur
tured, the grapevine can help managers get a feel for the morale of companies, understand 
the anxieties of the workforce, and evaluate the effectiveness of formal communications. 
Managers can improve the quality of information circulating through the company grapevine 
by sharing what they know, even if it is preliminary or partial information. By feeding infor-
mation to selected people, smart leaders can harness the power of the grapevine.
Gossip—which usually travels along the grapevine—is the main drawback of this com-
munication channel. Chronic gossipers often spread misinformation and undermine morale. 
A manager should deal directly with the gossiper, taking appropriate action depending on 
the severity of the situation. The manager can then use the grapevine and other communica-
tion channels to spread accurate information about the company.24

As organizations become more decentralized and more globally dispersed, informal 
communication—more than ever before—provides an important source of information, 
through e-mail, texting, and social media.
Nonverbal Communication
So far, this section has considered different forms of verbal communication, or commu-
nication that conveys meaning through words. Equally important is nonverbal communication, 
which transmits messages through actions and behaviors. Gestures, posture, eye contact, 
tone and volume of voice, and even clothing choices are all nonverbal actions that become 
communication cues. Nonverbal cues can have a far greater impact on communications than 
many people realize. In fact, it is estimated that 70 percent of interpersonal communication 
is conveyed through nonverbal cues. Top salespeople are particularly adept at reading and 
using these cues. For example, they practice “mirroring” a customer’s gestures and body 
language in order to indicate agreement.25
Even personal space—the physical distance between people who are engaging in 
communication—can convey powerful messages. Figure 9.5 shows a continuum of personal 
space and social interaction with four zones: intimate, personal, social, and public. In the 
United States, most business conversations occur within the social zone, roughly between 
4 and 12 feet apart. If one person tries to approach closer than that, the other will likely feel 
uncomfortable or even threatened.
Interpreting nonverbal cues can be especially challenging for people with different cul-
tural backgrounds. Concepts of appropriate personal space differ dramatically throughout 
most of the world. Latin Americans conduct business discussions in positions that most 
Americans and northern Europeans would find uncomfortably close. Americans often back 
away to preserve their personal space, a gesture that Latin Americans perceive as a sign of

cold and unfriendly relations. To protect their personal space, some Americans separate 
themselves across desks or tables from their Latin American counterparts—at the risk of 
challenging their colleagues to maneuver around those obstacles to reduce the uncomfort-
able distance.
People send nonverbal messages even when they consciously try to avoid doing so. 
Sometimes nonverbal cues convey a person’s true attitudes and thoughts, which may dif-
fer from spoken meanings. Generally, when verbal and nonverbal cues conflict, receivers of 
the communication tend to believe the nonverbal content. This is why firms seeking to hire 
people with good attitudes and a team orientation closely watch nonverbal behavior during 
job interviews in which job applicants participate in group sessions with other job candidates 
applying for the same job. If in those group interviews an applicant frowns or looks discour-
aged when a competing candidate gives a good answer, that nonverbal behavior suggests that 
this person may not be strongly team oriented.
External Communication 
and Crisis Management
External communication is a meaningful exchange of information through messages 
transmitted between an organization and its major audiences, such as customers, suppliers, 
other firms, the general public, and government officials. Businesses use external communi-
cation to keep their operations functioning, to maintain their positions in the marketplace, 
and to build customer relationships by supplying information about topics such as product 
modifications and price changes. Every communication with customers—including sales 
presentations and advertisements—should create goodwill and contribute to customer sat-
isfaction. Firms like Clorox use their Web sites to publish good news about the company, 
as described in the “Going Green” feature. Letting the public know about new initiatives 
for environmentally friendly processes as well as 
community projects and other socially responsible 
activities in which the firm is involved is an impor-
tant function of external communication.
However, all of this is threatened when com-
panies experience a public relations crisis that 
threatens their reputation or goodwill. Nestlé, one 
of the world’s largest food producers, faced such a 
crisis when the organization Greenpeace reported 
that the firm was importing palm oil from sup-
pliers who are damaging the rainforests in 
Indonesia—a habitat that is home to endangered 
orangutans and other fragile species. Outraged 
consumers flooded Nestlé’s Facebook page with 
angry comments. Nestlé’s lukewarm response to 
the problem turned more definitive after these 
postings—including admonishing Facebook visi-
tors for their aggression. This step angered con-
sumers further, until Nestlé’s Facebook moderator 
apologized “for being rude.”26

Clorox Comes Clean—Naturally
You’ve probably seen the Green Works brand of household and 
commercial cleaning solutions at your local supermarket—but you 
might not know that this line of natural, environmentally responsible 
cleaners is manufactured by the same people who make bleach. 
Clorox has committed itself wholeheartedly to ambitious initiatives 
aimed at reducing its impact on the environment through its manu-
facturing processes and the ingredients in its products. To accom-
plish this, the firm has established a department of Environmental 
Sustainability Strategy and an Eco Office. Its line of Green Works 
products meets strict environmental standards for ingredients, fra-
grances, packaging, and manufacturing processes. In addition, Clorox 
is working on similar efforts toward improving its traditional products. 
One of the first bits of external communication about its new 
focus on product ingredients was literally a list of ingredients, so 
consumers would have more information about the products they 
were buying. The list has grown in detail—Clorox now provides more 
detailed information about its safety processes, guidelines used to 
screen ingredients, and data on fragrances (a major component of 
cleaning solutions). Clorox asks all of its fragrance suppliers to adhere 
to increasingly strict fragrance standards in the development of new 
products. In fact, Clorox is the first major consumer packaged goods 
company to go to such lengths to communicate to consumers exactly 
what its products contain and how they are made.
In order to spread the word farther, Clorox recently launched its 
own Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Web site that contains a 
wealth of information about its processes and products. The site is 
easy to navigate, offers access to a complete listing of product ingre-
dients, and provides a comprehensive glossary of terms so consumers 
fully understand the function of each ingredient used in a product. 
Though the Web site is currently entirely in English, Clorox has plans 
for French and Spanish versions of the product ingredient section of 
the site.
Reaching even skeptical audiences, Clorox has gained the trust 
of the Sierra Club, with whom it has begun to partner on some of its 
programs. Together, Clorox and the Sierra Club trumpet the benefits 
of green cleaning. “Clorox is continuing to demonstrate the kind of 
progress we need companies to make,” notes Sierra Club Chairman 
Carl Pope. “Since we began working with them on the Green Works 
brand, we’ve seen their commitment to important areas such as prod-
uct innovation, ingredient communication, environmental stewardship 
and the transition to eliminate chlorine transportation from their U.S. 
supply chain. We applaud their approach to becoming even more 
open in communicating about their business practices and CSR 
commitments.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Clorox uses its CSR Web site to publish information and 
news about its green processes and products. How might 
the company use a social network such as Facebook to 
broaden its online external communication?
2. Do you think there is a downside to using the Internet for 
this type of communication? Why or why not?

How a company like Nestlé handles such an event can determine whether its reputation 
can be restored. Putting together a plan of action and dealing with facts and rumors immedi-
ately could be the difference between regaining trust and disaster. The following communi-
cation steps can help calm a public relations crisis:
1. When a crisis occurs, a firm should respond quickly. Executives should prepare a written 
statement—and stick to it. The statement should mention the time, place, initial descrip-
tion of what occurred (not the cause), and the number and status of the people involved.
2. As soon as possible, top company management should appear in public—if possible, to 
the press. Because the public will hold top management accountable, it’s best to have top 
managers responding to reporters’ questions.
3. When answering questions at an initial press conference or in an interview, the manage-
ment representative must stick to the facts. It’s likely that details about the event, the 
cause, and people’s roles will not yet be known; the spokesperson shouldn’t speculate. As 
information becomes available, the firm can provide accurate updates.
4. If a question is currently unanswerable, the executive can offer to find out the answer, 
which should be delivered in a timely manner. It’s not advisable to answer a question by 
saying, “No comment.” It’s much better to say, “I don’t know.”

5. The firm should acknowledge problems, explain solutions, and welcome feedback. If 
a question or factual statement puts the organization in a negative light, the manager 
should acknowledge the problem, and then explain how the firm is correcting it.
6. The press conference or interview will be most effective if the executive speaks briefly, 
clearly and provides visual images. If available, a video with positive images—such as 
thriving rainforests—can be useful.27
The crisis faced by Nestlé—the allegation that it was purchasing palm oil from a sup-
plier that was contributing to the destruction of rainforest—was exacerbated by the criticism 
it received on social media sites. Despite the fact that Nestle announced it would immedi-
ately stop purchasing the oil from this supplier, pointing out that this was only 1.25 percent 
of its total palm oil use, debate over the company’s environmental practices continued to 
rage online. Nestlé spokeswoman Nina Backes notes that it in these instances it is difficult 
“to show that we are listening, which we obviously are, while not getting into a shouting 
match.” Daniel Kessler, press officer at Greenpeace, acknowledges that social media present 
a new challenge for companies as they try to manage external communication. “This is the 
place where major corporations are very vulnerable,” he remarks.28
What’s Ahead
Today’s consumers expect the products they buy to be of the highest value for the price. 
Firms ensure this value by developing efficient systems for producing goods and services, as 
well as maintaining high quality. The next chapter examines the ways in which businesses

chase what they need to produce their goods and services, and manage large inventories to

Summary of Learning Objectives
Describe why and how organizations empower employees.
Managers empower employees by giving them the author-
ity and responsibility to make decisions about their work. 
Empowerment seeks to tap the brainpower of all workers to 
find improved ways of doing their jobs, better serving cus-
tomers, and achieving organizational goals. Empowerment 
often includes linking rewards to company performance 
through employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) and stock 
options.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 What is empowerment? Empowerment is giving 
employees authority and responsibility to make decisions 
about their work without traditional managerial approval 
and control.
1.2 What kinds of information can companies provide 
employees to help them share decision-making respon-
sibility? Sharing information about company performance, 
particularly financial performance, is one of the best ways to 
share decision-making responsibility.
1.3 How do employee stock ownership plans and stock 
options reward employees and encourage empowerment? 
Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) benefit employ-
ees by giving them ownership stakes in their companies. 
Employees are motivated to work harder and smarter than 
they would without ESOPs because they share in their firm’s 
financial success. In contrast to an ESOP, in which the com-
pany holds stock for the benefit of employees (when employ-
ees leave the company, they cash in their stock), stock options 
give employees a chance to own the stock themselves if they 
exercise their options by completing the stock purchase.

Distinguish among the five types of teams in the 
workplace.
The five basic types of teams are work teams, problem-
solving teams, self-managed teams, cross-functional teams, 
and virtual teams. Work teams are permanent groups of 
coworkers who perform the day-to-day tasks necessary to 
operate the organization. Problem-solving teams are 
temporary groups of employees who gather to solve spe-
cific problems and then disband. Self-managed teams have 
the authority to make decisions about how their members 
complete their daily tasks. Cross-functional teams are made 
up of members from different units, such as production, 
marketing, and finance. Virtual teams are groups of geo-
graphically or organizationally dispersed coworkers who use 
a combination of telecommunications and information tech-
nologies to accomplish an organizational task.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 What is a team? A team is a group of employees who 
are committed to a common purpose, approach, and set of 
performance goals.
2.2 What are the five types of teams, and how are they 
different? Work teams are permanent, while problem-
solving teams are temporary. Unlike work teams, self-
managed teams have the authority to change how they get 
their work done. Cross-functional teams are composed of 
people from different backgrounds, while virtual teams are 
composed of people from different locations.
Identify the characteristics of an effective team, and sum-
marize the stages of team development.
Three important characteristics of a team are its size, team 
level, and team diversity. The ideal team size is about six or 
seven members. Team level is the average level of ability, 
experience, personality, or any other factor on a team. Team 
diversity represents the variances or differences in ability, 
experience, personality, or any other factor on a team. Team 
diversity is an important consideration for teams that must 
complete a wide range of different tasks of particularly com-
plex tasks. Teams pass through five stages of development: (1) 
Forming is an orientation period during which members get 
to know each other and find out what behaviors are accept-
able to the group. (2) Storming is the stage during which 
individual personalities emerge as members clarify their roles 
and expectations. (3) Norming is the stage at which differ-
ences are resolved, members accept each other, and consen-
sus emerges about the roles of the team leader and other 
participants. (4) Performing is characterized by problem 
solving and a focus on task accomplishment. (5) Adjourning 
is the final stage, with a focus on wrapping up and summa-
rizing the team’s experiences and accomplishments.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 Explain team level and team diversity. While team 
level represents the average level or capability on a team, 
team diversity represents the variances or differences in abil-
ity, experience, personality, or any other factor on a team.
3.2 Explain how teams progress through the stages 
of team development. Teams pass through five stages of 
development: forming, storming, norming, performing, and 
adjourning.
Relate team cohesiveness and norms to effective team 
performance.
Team cohesiveness is the extent to which team members feel 
attracted to the team and motivated to remain on it. Team 
norms are standards of conduct shared by team members 
that guide their behavior. Highly cohesive teams whose 
members share certain standards of conduct tend to be more 
productive and effective.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 How does cohesiveness affect teams? Members of 
cohesive teams interact more often, share common attitudes 
and goals, have higher morale, and are more likely to help 
each other. Cohesive teams also perform better.
4.2 Explain how team norms positively and negatively 
affect teams. Norms are informal standards that identify 
key values and clarify team members’ expectations. But those 
norms can be positive or negative. Positive norms contribute 
to constructive work and the accomplishment of team goals. 
Negative norms can, for example, contribute to reduced 
work effort, reduced quality, and poor job attendance.
Describe the factors that can cause conflict in teams and 
ways to manage conflict.
Conflict and disagreement are inevitable in most teams. 
Conflict can stem from many sources: disagreements about 
goals and priorities, task-related issues, interpersonal incom-
patibilities, scarce resources, and simple fatigue. The key 
to dealing with team conflict is not avoiding it, but making 
sure that the team experiences the right kind of conflict. 
Cognitive conflict focuses on problem-related differences 
of opinion and, when reconciled, strongly improves team 
performance. By contrast, affective conflict refers to the emo-
tional reactions that can occur when disagreements become 
personal rather than professional, and these differences 
strongly decrease team performance. A team leader can man-
age team conflict by fostering good communication so team 
members perceive each other accurately, understand what is 
expected of them, and obtain the information they need.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 What is cognitive conflict, and how does it affect 
teams? With cognitive conflict, team members disagree 
because their different experiences and expertise lead them 
to different views of the problem and its solutions. Cognitive 
conflict is characterized by a willingness to examine, compare, 
and reconcile differences to produce the best possible solution.

5.2 Explain affective conflict and its impact on teams. 
Because affective conflict often results in hostility, anger, 
resentment, distrust, cynicism, and apathy, it can make 
people uncomfortable, cause them to withdraw, decrease 
their commitment to a team, lower the satisfaction of team 
members, and decrease team cohesiveness.
Explain the importance and process of effective 
communication.
Managers spend about 80 percent of their time in direct 
communication with others. Company recruiters consist-
ently rate effective communication—such as listening, con-
versing, and giving feedback—as the most important skill 
they look for when hiring new employees. The communi-
cation process follows a step-by-step process that involves 
interactions among six elements: sender, message, chan-
nel, audience, feedback, and context. The sender composes 
the message and sends it through the channel. The audi-
ence receives the message and interprets its meaning. The 
receiver gives feedback to the sender. The communication 
takes place in a situational or cultural context.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 What is the difference between communication in 
low-context and high-context cultures? Communication 
in low-context cultures tends to rely on explicit written 
and verbal messages. By contrast, communication in high-
context cultures depends not only on the message itself but 
also on the conditions that surround it, including nonverbal 
cues, past and present experiences, and personal relation-
ships between the parties.
6.2 In the context of the communication process, what 
is noise? Noise interferes with the transmission of messages 
and feedback. Noise can result from physical factors such 
as poor reception of a cell phone message or differences in 
people’s attitudes and perceptions.
Compare the different types of communication.
People exchange messages in many ways: oral and written, 
formal and informal, verbal and nonverbal communication. 
Effective written communication reflects its audience, its 
channel, and the appropriate degree of formality. Formal 
communication channels carry messages within the chain of 
command. Informal communication channels, such as the 
grapevine, carry messages outside the formal chain of 
command. Nonverbal communication plays a larger role 
than most people realize. Generally, when verbal and non-
verbal cues conflict, the receiver of a message tends to 
believe the meaning conveyed by nonverbal cues.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 Define the four common listening behaviors. 
Cynical listening occurs when the receiver of a message 
feels that the sender is trying to gain some advantage from 
the communication. Offensive listening occurs when the 
receiver tries to catch the speaker in a mistake or contradic-
tion. Polite listening occurs when the receiver is rehears-
ing what he or she wants to say when the speaker finishes. 
Active listening requires involvement with the information 
and empathy with the speaker’s situation.
7.2 What are the differences between formal and infor-
mal communication? Formal communication occurs within 
the formal chain of command defined by an organization. 
Informal communication occurs outside the organization’s 
hierarchy.
Explain external communication and methods of managing 
a public crisis.
External communication is a meaningful exchange of infor-
mation through messages transmitted between an organiza-
tion and its major audiences, such as customers, suppliers, 
other firms, the general public, and government officials. 
Every communication with customers should create good-
will and contribute to customer satisfaction. However, all of 
this is threatened when companies experience a public crisis 
that threatens their reputations or goodwill. To manage a 
public crisis, businesses should respond quickly and honestly, 
with a member of top management present.
Assessment Check Answers 
8.1 What is external communication? External commu-
nication is a meaningful exchange of information through 
messages transmitted between an organization and its major 
audiences.
8.2 What is the first thing a company should do when 
a public crisis occurs? The firm should respond quickly 
by preparing a written statement that includes the time, 
place, description of the event, and the number and status of 
people involved.

Projects and Teamwork Applications
1. Having the power and authority to make decisions about 
work is the essence of empowerment. For this project, the 
teacher steps back and gives the class free rein to plan and 
implement a day of classwork. The class might appoint a 
leader, divide into teams (to plan a lecture, come up with 
an assignment, plan a field trip, and the like). It’s completely 
up to the students how to organize and conduct the 
one-day class. After the class, discuss the experience—
including the upside and downside (if any) of empowerment.
2. Divide the class into teams of relatively equal size. Each 
team may select one of the following problems it intends to 
solve, or decide on one of its own: arranging for a certain 
speaker or expanding the vegetarian menu in the cafeteria. 
While it is not necessary to complete the entire problem-
solving process, each team should go through the forming 
stage of team development and establish norms during 
which it outlines a plan for accomplishing the group’s 
task. Is each team cohesive? Why or why not?
3. Try this listening exercise with a partner. First, spend a few 
minutes writing a paragraph or two about the most 
important thing that happened to you this week. Second, 
read your paragraph out loud to your partner. Next, have 
your partner read his or her paragraph. Finally, each take 
turns summarizing the most important points in each 
other’s stories. See how well you listened to each other.
4. On your own or with a classmate, visit the college library, 
mall, or anywhere else people gather. For about 10 or 15 
minutes, observe the nonverbal cues that people give each 
other: Does the librarian smile at students? What is the body 
language of students gathered in groups? When you leave 
the venue, jot down as many of your observations as you 
can. Notice things like changes in nonverbal communication 
when someone joins a group or leaves it.
5. Choose a company with which you are familiar, or whose 
products you use. Research the company’s offerings as well 
as some of its socially responsible and sustainability initia-
tives (e.g., if the firm has set a goal to reduce its energy 
consumption by 20 percent). Create an advertisement that 
focuses on one of these initiatives as an example of positive 
external communication from the company.

CASE 1.2
Case 9.1
SeaWorld Faces a Public Relations Crisis
Over the years, thousands of Orlando’s SeaWorld visi-
tors have been enthralled by the skilled antics of resident 
whales and their trainers. Most people recognize that at 
least some risk to the whales’ trainers is involved, partly 
because of the gigantic size and strength of these mam-
mals. But no one expected the tragedy that unfolded 
when a veteran trainer was yanked into the water by her 
pony tail by one of her favorite partners, Tilikum the Orca 
whale. Within moments, the trainer lost her life.
SeaWorld faced a huge public crisis in which com-
munication would prove to be crucial. The company was 
immediately bombarded with demands for answers. Were 
consumers in danger? Should all of SeaWorld be shut 
down? The fate of Tilikum (“Tilly”) was called into 
question—should he be safely quarantined or put down? 
Were there other, equally dangerous animals performing 
at the theme park? All of these questions were overshad-
owed by the fact that SeaWorld, including its managers 
and employees, had lost a beloved colleague.
SeaWorld immediately halted all Orca whale shows 
at its Orlando location as well as its sister parks in San 
Antonio and San Diego while details of the tragedy were 
reviewed. Although Orlando SeaWorld President Dan 
Brown held a press conference shortly after the event, 
crisis experts pointed out that he faltered when he didn’t 
correct the local sheriff’s spokesman, who stated that the 
trainer had accidentally fallen into the water alongside the 
whale. Brown only said, “She drowned in an incident with 
one of our killer whales.” When it was later revealed that 
Tilly had actually pulled the trainer into the water, Brown’s 
credibility was tainted. Once the discrepancy was cleared 
up, SeaWorld made its head trainer available to answer 
further questions posed by the press and explain more 
thoroughly SeaWorld’s training methods.
SeaWorld fielded accusations and attacks from all 
sides—from frightened families to animal rights advo-
cates. As rumors began to swirl about Tilly’s rambunctious 
history and his ultimate fate, it became apparent that 
there would be no easy solution. “If [SeaWorld] were 
to make even the slightest hint or suggestion that [Tilly] 
should be put down, I can only imagine the backlash that 
would come from animal rights groups from around the 
world on that one,” observed Steve Huxter, the former 
head trainer at Sealand of the Pacific, where Tilly lived 
before being transferred to SeaWorld.
Meanwhile, another wave was gathering to sweep 
across SeaWorld’s shore—this time in the form of 
Facebook and Twitter. SeaWorld was one of the early big 
companies to recognize the value of direct interaction with 
its customers by establishing a Facebook site and Twitter 
account. Both accounts were now deluged with com-
ments from worried fans and barbs from critics. Eventually 
SeaWorld was forced to shut down its Facebook wall tem-
porarily because of reportedly inappropriate photos relat-
ing to the tragedy. And @Shamu, the popular Twitter blog 
“ghostwritten” by Shamu the whale, was silenced.
But the Facebook site was reactivated shortly there-
after, and SeaWorld spokesman Fred Jacobs encouraged 
people to revisit it. He said that SeaWorld only censors 
postings that contain profanity or harassment, or would 
be insensitive to the trainer’s family and friends. “If you 
were to get on Facebook right now and ask a question 
about the morality of keeping whales in captivity, we’ll get 
back to you,” Jacobs promised. “Now is not the time to 
circle the wagons. There’s a value proposition between a 
company and the people who follow it on social media.” 
While some people were skeptical about the wisdom of 
opening itself up to so much direct interaction with the 
public, SeaWorld officials were firm in their stance: this 
was their cue to listen.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How might SeaWorld’s Dan Brown have better 
handled his initial press conference after the 
accident?
2. Going forward, how might SeaWorld use social 
media to heal and strengthen its relationship 
with the public?

Windy City Fieldhouse: It’s All about Teams
Case 9.2
Team building has become an industry unto itself—
as more managers understand the importance of fostering 
strong, effective teams, companies that specialize in cre-
ative way to build teams. Chicago’s Windy City Fieldhouse 
is one such firm. Even the name sounds like fun and 
games, and that’s the intention.
Windy City Fieldhouse (WCF) develops and offers 
its corporate clients programs designed to bring people 
together in such a way that they don’t even realize they 
are engaging in team-building and communication exer-
cises. The WCF staff hosts outdoor corporate picnics, 
fun runs/walks, carnivals and block parties, even Grand 
Prix racing events. Of course, if a client wants a more 
traditional training program, WCF will do that too—but 
most companies go for the fun. “Striving to provide pro-
grams that enhance meaningful relationships and add 
tremendous value, WCF continues to develop a variety of 
corporate event packages in order to respond to its clients’ 
needs,” states the Web site. 
WCF is perhaps best known for its “Scavenger 
Hunts in Chicago” (SHIC) division, which custom designs 
“Mission Impossible” scavenger hunts around the Chicago 
area for client teams. SHIC creates, organizes, and leads 
the corporate event in such a way that teams must collab-
orate to solve clues used to reach a destination chosen by 
the client company. The destination can be anything from 
a cocktail party to dinner at a Chicago Cubs game—it’s 
up to the client. A Scavenger Hunt facilitator is provided 
for each team, and once they reach their final destination, 
team members must complete certain missions such as 
taking funny photographs or finding special objects. With 
a facilitator acting as team leader, “Mission Impossible” 
team members learn how to set goals, establish norms, 
and make the most of diversity.
The response from participants is nearly always 
enthusiastic. “The feedback from my team was over-
whelmingly positive,” says one client. Another reports, 
“It has been a long time since this team has had a team 
gathering and when they did, we never had this much 
participation. Everyone really enjoyed the event.” Windy 
City Fieldhouse is certainly on to something—the firm has 
been named “Best Teambuilding Company” in Chicago for 
three straight years.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Imagine that you had an opportunity to partici-
pate in one of SHIC’s scavenger hunts. How do 
you think you would benefit from the experi-
ence as a team member?
2. Why is it important for SHIC to provide a facili-
tator for each team-building experience?

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
312
The hotel and restaurant industry caters to its guests, 
but it has always had a reputation for being somewhat 
inhospitable to its employees. Traditionally, hotel and res-
taurant workers put in long hours for low pay and little 
or no recognition; they’re the invisible hosts who fluff the 
pillows and sweep away crumbs. But Kimpton Hotels is 
setting a new example by treating its employees as some-
thing better than family: they are, in many ways, business 
partners.
Kimpton Hotels was founded in 1981 by Bill 
Kimpton, an investment banker with a vision for boutique 
hotels: small, luxurious hotels with impeccably intimate 
service and gourmet restaurants. Today, Kimpton oper-
ates 50 hotels and restaurants around the country, each 
beautifully designed and furnished. “But more than that,” 
notes COONikiLeondakis, “the people really separate 
us” from other hotels. As COO, Leondakis knows first-
hand the difference at Kimpton. Leondakis talks about 
her company’s full-blown commitment to empowering 
employees to make decisions, to take part in running 
the business, to grow as professionals. “The employee of 
today wants more and expects more, and is not willing 
just to be a servant, loyal worker, or soldier,” she says. 
Leondakis is proud of that fact and of the army of top-
flight employees and managers who work at Kimpton’s 
various locations.
One of those managers is Peggy Trott, the general 
manager of the Kimpton Hotel Palomar in Philadelphia. Trott 
explains how Kimpton empowers its employees. “Kimpton 
wants each general manager to be an entrepreneur,” she 
says. “They want you to operate your hotel as if it is your 
own business. So there’s a lot of leeway.” While some man-
agers might argue that this puts undue pressure on them to 
perform as business owners, Trott views the challenge as an 
opportunity. She notes that the attitude toward empower-
ment travels from the top down in the organization. She 
says that each of her employees is charged with being a 
hero every day, especially when it comes to guest service. If 
an employee is acting on behalf of a guest, then he or she 
is free to make the decision on the spot.
“I have high expectations, but I think that when you 
give people high expectations, they rise to the occasion,” 
says Trott. For example, if a housekeeper sees that one of 
her guest rooms is housing a family of two parents and 
two children, the housekeeper is expected to stock the 
room with extra towels instead of waiting for the guests to 
call the front desk requesting more towels. No matter how 
large or small the task might seem, “We expect people to 
be self-leaders,” notes NikiLeondakis. “We expect employ-
ees to use their heads.”
Because each of the 50 Kimpton hotel and restaurant 
properties is unique to its location and local population, 
Kimpton actively recruits employees with diverse back-
grounds and qualifications, then gives them the authority to 
serve their guests as they see best. Individuality is nurtured 
rather than squelched. NikiLeondakis observes that, because 
her employees come with a wide range of experience at dif-
ferent locations in the hospitality industry, sometimes it is dif-
ficult to get them to leave behind their previous assumptions 
about their role as hotel workers. “The biggest challenge 
with employee empowerment and communication is that 
we’re all products of our past,” Leondakis says. New employ-
ees often have to be retrained to think outside the box, 
make decisions, and “rock the boat,” as Leondakis puts it.
The results of this retraining toward empowerment 
have not gone unnoticed. Kimpton Hotels consistently 
win awards for service, and the group has received many 
accolades for its approach to human resource manage-
ment, including a recent award from the Human Rights 
Campaign for “Workplace Equality Innovation.” In addi-
tion, Kimpton is regularly named to Fortune’s list of “100 
Best Companies to Work For.”
Recent praise from the industry publication Hospitality 
Design included a statement from Kimpton CEO, Michael 
Depatie, crediting NikiLeondakis with much of the compa-
ny’s HR success. “Niki has an extraordinary ability to connect 
with people, from guests she meets on the road to each 
and every one of our employees,” said Depatie. Leondakis, 
managers like Peggy Trott, and the entire staff, embody their 
company’s assertion that “Our employees are our brand.”

1. Give three specific reasons why empowerment is 
key to the success of a firm like Kimpton Hotels. 
How might this distinguish it from other hotel 
companies?
2. Select the concept of either a problem-solving

ture such as Japan, how might communication 
between staff and guests differ?

 A soccer ball seems like a simple thing to 
make—some panels stitched together in a globe 
and inflated with air. But ask anyone involved in 
World Cup soccer (called “football” around most of 
the world), or in production at Adidas, and they’ll 
tell you different. Manufacturing a soccer ball, 
particularly the official model for the FIFA World Cup 
soccer championships, is a complex process. Adidas 
has been the lucky winner of the contract to produce 
the official championship soccer ball numerous times 
since 1970. Despite its consistent performance, the 
firm never rests on its laurels. Instead, its design and 
production teams strive to come up with a better 
product every time.
So when the latest model was unveiled, soccer fans 
had reason to celebrate. Called the Jabulani, which 
means “to celebrate” in isiZulu, the soccer ball’s 
name paid homage to the year’s host nation of the 
World Cup—the Republic of South Africa. The ball 
was produced in 11 colors—representing the 11 
players on every team, the 11 official languages of 
South Africa, the 11 South African tribes that make 
up the nation, and the 11th Adidas World Cup ball. 
Each ball contained four triangle-shaped figures on 
a white background, emulating traditional African 
designs.
But there was much more to the new match ball 
than bright colors. The ball featured innovative 
technology, including eight 3-D globe-shaped panels 
that were molded in the interior of the ball for 
perfect roundness. Reducing the number of outer 
panels and seams gave the ball a 70 percent larger 
striking surface. A feature from the previous model, 
the goose-bump surface, was improved to give 
players more control over the ball no matter what 
the weather on the field. From the first practice 
kick, the players loved the new ball. “Fantastic, the 
ball does exactly what I wanted it to,” praised one 
player. Another player agreed: “A very strong ball, 
true to hit.”
Before the Jabulani ever reached the toes of World 
Cup soccer players, it went through rigorous testing 
at Adidas’s labs in England and Germany, where 
robots kicked at prototypes and simulated wind 
gusts attempted to blow them off course. By the 
time the final product was ready, it was as near 
to perfection as Adidas’s designers, engineers, 
production staff, and testers could make it. Of 
course, the Jabulani had to meet all the required 
specifications for a match ball, including weight, 
circumference, diameter, air pressure, and even 
water absorption.
Adidas also had to meet production demand 
for the World Cup (for official teams as well as 
consumers). The company contracted with the 
Pakistani manufacturing plant, Forward Group, to 
produce the entire supply of hand-stitched replica 
Jabulani models to be sold to the mass market. 
Forward Group expected to ship 6 million replica 
balls in one year, despite chronic power outages and 
other production problems. In fact, the economy of 
Sialkot, the town where the balls were produced, 
depends on soccer ball manufacturing. The official 
Jabulani match balls were produced by a factory 
in China, which had the capacity for the thermally 
bonded balls used in World Cup play. The balls were 
then shipped from both countries to the shelves of 
sporting goods stores around the world, and to the 
bright green fields of the World Cup in South Africa.1

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
Overview
10
By producing and marketing the goods 
and services that people want, businesses 
satisfy their commitment to society as a 
whole. They create what economists call 
utility—the want-satisfying power of a good 
or service. Businesses can create or enhance 
four basic kinds of utility: time, place, 
ownership, and form. A firm’s marketing 
operation generates time, place, and 
ownership utility by offering products to 
customers at a time and place that is 
convenient for purchase.
Production creates form utility by con-
verting raw materials and other inputs into 
finished products, such as Adidas’ Jabulani 
soccer ball. Production uses resources, 
including workers and machinery, to convert 
materials into finished goods and services. 
This conversion process may make major 
changes in raw materials or simply combine 
already finished parts into new products. 
The task of production and operations 
management in a firm is to oversee the 
production process by managing people 
and machinery in converting materials and 
resources into finished goods and services, 
which is illustrated by Figure 10.1.
People sometimes use the terms produc-
tion and manufacturing interchangeably, but 
the two are actually different. Production 
spans both manufacturing and nonmanufac-
turing industries. For instance, companies 
that engage in fishing or mining engage in 
production, as do firms that provide package 
deliveries or lodging. Figure 10.2 lists five 
examples of production systems for a variety 
of goods and services.
But whether the production process 
results in a tangible good such as a car 
or an intangible service such as cable 
television, it always converts inputs into 
outputs. A cabinetmaker combines wood, 
tools, and skill to create finished kitchen 
cabinets for a new home. A transit system 
combines buses, trains, and employees to 
create its output: passenger transportation. 
Both of these production processes create 
utility.
This chapter describes the process of 
producing goods and services. It looks at 
the importance of production and operations 
management and discusses the new tech-
nologies that are transforming the 
production function. It then discusses 
the tasks of the production and operations 
manager, the importance of quality, and 
the methods businesses use to ensure 
high quality.

Typical Production Systems
The Strategic Importance 
of Production
Along with marketing and finance, production is a vital business activity. Without 
products to sell, companies cannot generate money to pay their employees, lenders, and 
stockholders. And without the profits from products, firms quickly fail. The production 
process is just as crucial in nonprofit organizations, such as the St. Jude Children’s Research 
Hospital and Goodwill Industries, because the goods or services they offer justify their exis-
tence. Effective production and operations management can lower a firm’s costs of produc-
tion, boost the quality of its goods and services, allow it to respond dependably to customer 
demands, and enable it to renew itself by providing new products. Let’s look at the differ-
ences among mass, flexible, and customer-driven production.

Mass Production
From its beginnings as a colonial supplier of raw materials to Europe, the United 
States has evolved into an industrial giant. Much of this change has resulted from mass 
production, a system for manufacturing products in large quantities through effective com-
binations of employees with specialized skills, mechanization, and standardization. Mass 
production makes outputs (goods and services) available in large quantities at lower prices 
than individually crafted items would cost. It is mass production that brought cars, comput-
ers, televisions, books, and even homes to the majority of the population—that’s right, even 
homes. William Levitt made homes affordable to the average American from the 1940s to 
the 1960s, by removing the most expensive items—the basements—and mass-producing 
them at the rate of one every 16 minutes. Levitt’s first planned community, Levittown, 
brought his company a profit of about $5 million more than 60 years ago. Levitt, often 
called the Pioneer of Suburbs, followed a simple strategy. “Any fool can build homes,” he 
quipped. “What counts is how many you can sell for how little.”2
Mass production begins with the specialization of labor, dividing work into its simplest 
components so that each worker can concentrate on performing one task. By separating jobs 
into small tasks, managers create conditions for high productivity through mechanization, in 
which machines perform much of the work previously done by people. Standardization, the 
third element of mass production, involves producing uniform, interchangeable goods and 
parts. Standardized parts simplify the replacement of defective or worn-out components. For 
instance, if your car’s windshield wiper blades wear out, you can easily buy replacements at a 
local auto parts store such as AutoZone.
A logical extension of these principles of specialization, mechanization, and standardiza-
tion led to development of the assembly line. This manufacturing method moves the product 
along a conveyor belt past a number of workstations, where workers perform specialized 
tasks such as welding, painting, installing individual parts, and tightening bolts. Henry Ford’s 
application of this concept revolutionized auto assembly. Before the assembly line, it took 
Ford’s workers 12 hours to assemble a Model T car. But with an assembly line, it took just 
1.5 hours to make the same car. Not surprisingly, dozens of other industries soon adopted 
the assembly-line process.
Although mass production has important advantages, it has limitations, too. While mass 
production is highly efficient for producing large numbers of similar products, it is highly 
inefficient when producing small batches of different items. This trade-off might tempt some 
companies to focus on efficient production methods rather than on making what customers 
really want. In addition, the labor specialization associated with mass production can lead to 
boring jobs, because workers keep repeating the same task. To improve their competitive 
capabilities, many firms adopt flexible production and customer-driven production systems. 
These methods won’t replace mass production in every case, but in many instances might 
lead to improved product quality and greater job satisfaction. It might also enhance the use 
of mass production.
Flexible Production
While mass production is effective for creating large quantities of one item, flexible pro-
duction is usually more cost-effective for producing smaller runs. Flexible production can take 
many forms, but it generally involves using information technology to share the details of 
customer orders, programmable equipment to fulfill the orders, and skilled people to carry 
out whatever tasks are needed to fill a particular order. This system is even more beneficial

when combined with lean production methods that use automa-
tion and information technology to reduce requirements for 
workers and inventory. Flexible production requires a lot of 
communication among everyone in the organization.
Flexible production is now widely used in the auto industry; 
whereas Henry Ford revolutionized auto production in the early 
20th century, automakers such as Toyota and Honda are inno-
vating with new methods of production. Changing from mass 
production to flexible production has enabled these companies 
to produce different kinds of cars at the same plant. Honda now 
builds 15 different models spread across four plants in North 
America. “Using our flexible manufacturing capacity, we plan 
to continue to maintain our local production levels at approxi-
mately 80 percent of our annual sales,” states a company spokes-
person.3 This is good news for U.S. workers and consumers.
Customer-Driven Production
A customer-driven production system evaluates customer demands in order to make the 
connection between products manufactured and products bought. Many firms use this 
approach with great success. One method is to establish computer links between factories 
and retailers’ scanners, using data about sales as the basis for creating short-term forecasts 
and designing production schedules to meet those forecasts. Another approach to customer-
driven production systems is simply not to make the product until a customer orders it—
whether it’s a taco or a computer. Massachusetts-based Shibui Designs creates custom-made 
dresses in high-end fabrics for female executives and other women over 40. Each item of 
clothing is custom cut and fit to a single customer’s measurements. Founder Elizabeth Nill, 
who is over 60, started the business because she couldn’t find clothing that fit well. “I don’t 
have the body of a model, and the bulges are real. Truly made classic clothing that is custom 
made-to-measure helps camouflage these inevitable imperfections and makes me feel more 
elegant.” Nill’s customers agree.4
Production Processes
Not surprisingly, the production processes and time required to make an Apple iPad and 
a gallon of gasoline are different. Production processes use either an analytic or synthetic 
system; time requirements call for either a continuous or an intermittent process.
An analytic production system reduces a raw material to its component parts in order 
to extract one or more marketable products. Petroleum refining breaks down crude oil 
into several marketable products, including gasoline, heating oil, and aviation fuel. When 
corn is processed, the resulting marketable food products include animal feed and corn 
sweetener.
A synthetic production system is the reverse of an analytic system. It combines a number 
of raw materials or parts or transforms raw materials to produce finished products. Canon’s 
assembly line produces a camera by assembling various parts such as a shutter or a lens cap. 
Other synthetic production systems make drugs, chemicals, computer chips, and canned soup.

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
A continuous production process generates finished products over a lengthy period of 
time. The steel industry provides a classic example. Its blast furnaces never completely shut 
down except for malfunctions. Petroleum refineries, chemical plants, and nuclear power 
facilities also practice continuous production. A shutdown can damage sensitive equipment, 
with extremely costly results.
An intermittent production process generates products in short production runs, shut-
ting down machines frequently or changing their configurations to produce different prod-
ucts. Most services result from intermittent production systems. For instance, accountants, 
plumbers, and dentists traditionally have not attempted to standardize their services because 
each service provider confronts different problems that require individual approaches. 
However, some companies such as Jiffy Lube (auto service), H&R Block (tax preparation 
service), and Lawn Dawg (lawn-care service), offer standardized services as part of a strategy 
to operate more efficiently and compete with lower prices. McDonald’s, well-known for its 
nearly continuous production of food, has moved toward a more intermittent production 
model. The fast-food chain invested millions in new cooking equipment to set up kitchens 
for preparing sandwiches quickly to order, rather than producing large batches ahead of time 
and then keeping them warm under heat lamps.
Technology and the 
Production Process
Production continues to change rapidly as computer technologies develop. Many manu-
facturing plants are now “lights out” facilities that are completely automated—meaning no 
workers are required to build or make the products. While this signals a change in the types 
of jobs available in manufacturing, it also means that companies can design, produce, and 
adapt products more quickly to meet customers’ changing needs.
Green Manufacturing Processes
More and more firms are pouring resources into the development of manufacturing 
processes that result in a reduction of waste, energy use, and pollution. Companies rang-
ing in size from Walmart to the local café are finding ways to operate in a more sustainable 
manner—whether it is using biofuel to power a fleet of delivery trucks or eliminating unnec-
essary packaging, firms have begun to view the steps they take with pride. Vermont-based 
Seventh Generation, which makes household goods and cleaning products, has implemented 
sustainable manufacturing processes from the very outset. The firm uses a systemic approach 
to its operations, considering the entire impact of its processes and products on the environ-
ment. Seventh Generation consistently audits and makes changes in its processes, whether 
it is cutting emissions from its distribution system or redesigning its packages. “It’s the best 
insurance any company can have for long-term success,” notes co-founder and top executive 
Jeffrey Hollender.5 The “Going Green” feature describes how energy firms are developing 
new methods for drilling for natural gas that are much less damaging to the environment 
than traditional methods.
Firms that are involved in construction—or are thinking of building new offices or 
manufacturing plants—are turning their attention to LEED (Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design) certification for their facilities. LEED is a voluntary certification

Drilling for Natural Gas—Clean Alternatives
Drilling for natural gas doesn’t usually conjure up images of an 
undisturbed landscape. In fact, studies by the EPA as well as private 
environmental groups reveal that the major method for extracting 
natural gas from the earth—hydraulic fracturing—can result in con-
taminated water supplies. Hydraulic fracturing involves injecting millions 
of gallons of water, sand, and chemicals deep into the ground to crack 
open the beds of shale containing natural gas, allowing the gas to rise 
to the surface. Environmental scientists as well as residents of com-
munities near where the drilling takes place are concerned about the 
amount of water being used as well as potential contamination of sur-
rounding water supplies by the chemicals used in the process.
A number of the energy companies—including those that drill 
for oil and natural gas—are paying attention to these concerns. 
Environmental Technologies Ltd. is making a nontoxic alternative to 
the toxic chemicals, stating that their product kills bacteria just as 
effectively. Ecosphere Technologies Inc., with headquarters in Florida, 
claims it can eliminate the need for anti-bacterial chemicals completely 
by killing the bacteria at the surface before water is injected into the 
gas wells. Ecosphere also helps energy producers reuse the water 
from hydraulic fracturing in order to reduce water use and waste. 
Traditionally, companies have paid to have millions of gallons of waste 
water shipped to treatment plants or disposal sites.
None of these firms is advocating the cessation of drilling. Drew 
Bledsoe, former NFL player who is now an investor in Ecosphere 
Technologies, explains why. “We’ve got so much gas under the 
ground here domestically that we can really take a bite out of our 
dependence on foreign energy,” he says. Instead, the firms are 
researching and developing greener technologies. In fact, new com-
panies—and divisions or subsidiaries of the larger energy firms—are 
forming rapidly to take advantage of this business opportunity. 
“There’s a lot of companies trying to get into the business,” observes 
Jack Stabenau, a former Halliburton manager who has been hired by 
Water Tectonics to run its new division Blu Energy Solutions. “I’ve lit-
erally had people send me stuff that they’ve been working on in their 
garage.”

and involves meeting standards in energy savings, water efficiency, CO2 emissions reduc-
tion, improved indoor environmental quality (including air and natural light), and other

Robots
A growing number of manufacturers have freed workers from boring, sometimes dan-
gerous jobs by replacing them with robots. A robot is a reprogrammable machine capable 
of performing a variety of tasks that require the repeated manipulation of materials and 
tools. Robots can repeat the same tasks many times without varying their movements. Many 
factories use robots today to stack their products on pallets and shrink-wrap them for ship-
ping. Boston Scientific, a firm that makes medical devices, uses robots made by Kiva in two 
of its distribution centers. Saks Fifth Avenue recently purchased a Kiva robot system for its 
Maryland distribution center as the initial move in an effort to convert its fulfillment center 
from manual to automated operations.7
Historically, robots were most common in automotive and electronics manufacturing, 
but growing numbers of industries are adding robots to production lines as improvements in 
technology make them less expensive and more useful. Firms operate many different types 
of robots. The simplest kind, a pick-and-place robot, moves in only two or three directions

as it picks up something from one spot and places it in another. 
So-called field robots assist people in nonmanufacturing, often 
hazardous, environments such as nuclear power plants, the 
international space station, and even battlefields. Police use 
robots to remotely dispose of suspected bombs. However, the 
same technology can be used in factories. Using vision systems, 
infrared sensors, and bumpers on mobile platforms, robots can 
automatically move parts or finished goods from one place to 
another, while either following or avoiding people, whichever 
is necessary to do the job. For instance, machine vision systems 
are being used more frequently for complex applications such 
as quality assurance in the manufacturing of medical devices. 
The advancements in machine vision components like cameras, 
illumination systems, and processors have greatly improved their 
capabilities. Companies like Minnesota-based PPT Vision help 
firms such as B. Braun Penang (Malaysia) boost productivity, 
manage risk, and improve quality across all of its product lines 
including syringe needles, pharmaceutical vials, and intravenous 
(IV) infusion bottles.8
Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing
A process called computer-aided design (CAD) allows engineers to design components 
as well as entire products on computer screens faster and with fewer mistakes than they 
could achieve working with traditional drafting systems. Using an electronic pen, an engi-
neer can sketch three-dimensional (3-D) designs on an electronic drafting board or directly 
on the screen. The computer then provides tools to make major and minor design changes 
and to analyze the results for particular characteristics or problems. Engineers can put a new 
car design through a simulated road test to project its real-world performance. If they find a 
problem with weight distribution, for example, they can make the necessary changes virtu-
ally—without actually test-driving the car. With advanced CAD software, prototyping is as 
much “virtual” as it is “hands-on.” Actual prototypes or parts aren’t built until the engineers 
are satisfied that the required structural characteristics in their virtual designs have been met. 
Dentistry has benefited from CAD, which can design and create on-site such products as 
caps and crowns that fit a patient’s mouth or jaw perfectly.9
The process of computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) picks up where the CAD sys-
tem leaves off. Computer tools enable a manufacturer to analyze the steps that a machine 
must take to produce a needed product or part. Electronic signals transmitted to process-
ing equipment provide instructions for performing the appropriate production steps in the 
correct order. Both CAD and CAM technologies are now used together at most modern 
production facilities. These so-called CAD/CAM systems are linked electronically to auto-
matically transfer computerized designs into the production facilities, saving both time and 
effort. They also allow more precise manufacturing of parts.
Flexible Manufacturing Systems
A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is a production facility that workers can 
quickly modify to manufacture different products. The typical system consists of 
computer-aided

that allows engineers to

computer-controlled machining centers to produce metal parts, robots to handle the parts, 
and remote-controlled carts to deliver materials. All components are linked by electronic 
controls that dictate activities at each stage of the manufacturing sequence, even automati-
cally replacing broken or worn-out drill bits and other implements.
Flexible manufacturing systems have been enhanced by powerful new software that 
allows machine tools to be reprogrammed while they are running. This capability allows 
the same machine to make hundreds of different parts without the operator having to shut 
the machine down each time to load new programs. The software also connects to the 
Internet to receive updates or to control machine tools at other sites. And because the soft-
ware resides on a company’s computer network, engineers can use it to diagnose production 
problems any time, from anywhere they can access the network. Nissan Motor Co. recently 
expanded its flexible manufacturing system to join venture plants in emerging markets that 
include China, Thailand, and India. In general, this allows the firm to cut its lead time and 
investment in half when launching new models. However, the move is not without kinks that 
will take time to smooth out.10
Computer-Integrated Manufacturing
Companies integrate robots, CAD/CAM, FMS, computers, and other technologies to 
implement computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM), a production system in which 
computers help workers design products, control machines, handle materials, and control 
the production function in an integrated fashion. This type of manufacturing does not nec-
essarily imply more automation and fewer people than other alternatives. It does, however, 
involve a new type of automation organized around the computer. The key to CIM is a 
centralized computer system running software that integrates and controls separate processes 
and functions. The advantages of CIM include increased productivity, decreased design 
costs, increased equipment utilization, and improved quality.
CIM is widely used in the printing industry to coordinate thousands of printing jobs, 
some very small. CIM saves money by combining many small jobs into one larger one and 
by automating the printing process from design to delivery. Global printing company MAN 
Roland uses CIM to provide printing solutions for its business customers. One of its products, 
PRINTVALUE, offers a complete line of solutions for every aspect of a customer’s pressroom.11
The Location Decision
The decision of where to locate a production facility hinges on transportation, human, 
and physical factors, as shown in Table 10.1. Transportation factors include proximity 
to markets and raw materials, along with availability of alternative modes for transport-
ing both inputs and outputs. Automobile assembly plants are located near major rail lines. 
Inputs—such as engines, plastics, and metal parts—arrive by rail, and the finished vehicles 
are shipped out by rail. Shopping malls are often located next to major streets and freeways 
in suburban areas, because most customers arrive by car.
Physical variables involve such issues as weather, water supplies, available energy, and 
options for disposing of hazardous waste. Theme parks, such as Walt Disney World, are 
often located in warm climates so they can be open, and attract visitors, year-round. A man-
ufacturing business that wants to locate near a community must prepare an environmental

impact study that analyzes how a proposed plant would affect the quality of life in the sur-
rounding area. Regulatory agencies typically require these studies to cover topics such as the 
impact on transportation facilities; energy requirements; water and sewage treatment needs; 
natural plant life and wildlife; and water, air, and noise pollution.
Human factors in the location decision include an area’s labor supply, local regulations, 
taxes, and living conditions. Management considers local labor costs, as well as the availabil-
ity of workers with needed qualifications. Software makers and other computer-related firms 
concentrate in areas with the technical talent they need, including California’s Silicon Valley, 
Boston, and Austin, Texas. By contrast, some labor-intensive industries have located plants 
in rural areas with readily available labor pools and limited high-wage alternatives. And some 
firms with headquarters in the United States and other industrialized countries have moved 
production off-shore in search of low wages. But no matter what type of industry a firm is 
in, a production and operations manager’s facility location decision must consider the fol-
lowing factors:
 
• proximity to suppliers, warehouses, and service operations
 • insurance and taxes
 • availability of such employee needs as housing, schools, mass transportation, day care, 
shopping, and recreational facilities
 • size, skills, and costs of the labor force
 • ample space for current and future needs of the firm
 • distance to market for goods
 • receptiveness of the community
 • economical transportation for materials and supplies, as well as for finished goods
 • climate and environment that matches the industry’s needs and employees’ lifestyle
 • amount and cost of energy services
 • government incentives.
A recent trend in location strategy is bringing production facilities closer to the final 
markets where the goods will be sold. One reason for this is reduced time and cost for ship-
ping. Another reason is a closer cultural affinity between the parent company and supplier 
(in cases where production remains overseas). This has led some business developers to 
label Central America “the new Asia.”12 German automaker Volkswagen decided to build a 
$1 billion manufacturing plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, for the construction of its new 
midsize sedan. Volkswagen expects to roll 150,000 vehicles out of the plant each year, with 
possibilities for a major expansion that would increase production capacity even more. CEO 
Stefan Jacoby notes that the plant is part of Volkswagen’s overall strategy for capturing more 
of the U.S. auto market. “With Chattanooga, we’re laying the groundwork to be profitable 
in the U.S. and have a durable business in the U.S.,” he explains.13
State and local governments may offer incentives to businesses that are willing to 
locate in their region. These incentives may take the form of tax breaks, agreements to 
improve infrastructure, and the like. The “Hit & Miss” feature describes how Twin Creeks

Mississippi is becoming a new hub of high-tech manufacturing. 
Two major manufacturers recently agreed to build facilities in the state. 
One of these companies is Twin Creeks Technologies, which is locating 
its new solar panel production facility in Senatobia. Not only will the 
project generate new jobs for the local economy, its products—solar 
panels—represent the latest technology in generating solar power. 
In addition, its manufacturing processes are cleaner and greener than 
those used by other production plants. Carrying a price tag of more 
than $175 million, the facility will occupy 250,000 square feet when 
complete and create several hundred jobs for local workers, including 
administrative and factory jobs. “This facility will be the first renewable 
solar technology production plant in the state,” declared Mississippi 
governor Haley Barbour, “and I commend this innovative start-up com-
pany for its commitment to doing business in the state and for creating 
over 500 jobs for the residents of Mississippi.”
Twin Creeks isn’t going it alone. The State of Mississippi is pro-
viding $50 million in loan assistance through the Mississippi Major 
Economic Impact Authority for the building project. In addition, the 
State and the City of Senatobia are providing $4 million toward 
improvement of infrastructure—roads, utilities, water, and so forth—at 
the building site. Twin Creeks considered 25 sites in six other states 
before deciding on the Senatobia location in Mississippi. “The State 
of Mississippi and the Governor’s office have been extremely helpful 
in driving the agreement to closure in record time,” says Siva Sivaram, 
chairman and CEO for Twin Creeks. “We look forward to rapidly break-
ing ground on our manufacturing site, becoming an active member of

Twin Creeks is also working with Northwest Mississippi 
Community College, the University of Mississippi’s Center for 
Manufacturing Excellence, and UM’s School of Engineering to 
recruit engineers and begin training other potential job candidates 
for the plant. This part of the location decision is particularly 
popular among residents of the area, where the unemployment 
rate topped 13 percent recently. “Twin Creeks was the first major 
economic development project to utilize Mississippi’s new clean 
energy incentives program, which will open the door for new job 
opportunities in the clean energy sector for all Mississipians,” notes 
Gray Swoope, executive director of the Mississippi Development 
Authority.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. In addition to government incentives, what other factors 
did Twin Creeks likely consider in its decision to locate its 
plant in Senotobia?
2. In what ways does the community benefit from this deci-
sion? Might there be any drawbacks?

The Job of Production Managers
Production and operations managers oversee the work of people and machinery to con-
vert inputs (materials and resources) into finished goods and services. As Figure 10.3 shows, 
these managers perform four major tasks.
1. Plan the overall production process.
2. Determine the best layout for the firm’s facilities.
3. Implement the production plan.
4. Control the manufacturing process to maintain the highest possible quality.
Part of the control process involves continuous evaluation of results. If problems occur, 
managers return to the first step and make adjustments.

Planning the Production Process
Production planning begins by choosing what goods or services to offer to customers. 
This decision is the essence of every company’s reason for operating. Other decisions such as 
machinery purchases, pricing decisions, and selection of retail outlets all grow out of product 
planning. But with product planning, it’s not enough to plan products that satisfy customers. 
Products must satisfy customers and be produced as efficiently and inexpensively as possible. 
So while marketing research studies determine consumer reactions to proposed products and 
estimate potential sales and profitability levels, production departments focus on planning 
the production process when they (1) convert original product ideas into final specifications 
and (2) design the most efficient facilities to produce those products.
It is important for production managers to understand how a project fits into the com-
pany’s structure because this will affect the success of the project. In a traditional manu-
facturing organization, each production manager is given a specific area of authority and 
responsibility such as purchasing or inventory control. One drawback to this structure is that 
it may actually pit the purchasing manager against the inventory control manager. As more 
organizations have moved toward team-oriented structures, some organizations assign team 
members to specific projects reporting to the production manager. Each team is responsible 
for the quality of its products and has the authority to make changes to improve performance 
and quality. The major difference between the two approaches is that all workers on teams 
are responsible for their output, and teamwork avoids the competitiveness between managers 
often found in traditional structures.
Determining the Facility Layout
The next production management task is determining the best layout for the facility. An 
efficient facility layout can reduce material handling, decrease costs, and improve product 
flow through the facility. This decision requires managers to consider all phases of produc-
tion and the necessary inputs at each step. Figure 10.4 shows three common layout designs: 
process, product, and fixed-position layouts. It also shows a customer-oriented layout typical 
of service providers’ production systems.
A process layout groups machinery and equipment according to their functions. The work 
in process moves around the plant to reach different workstations. A process layout often 
facilitates production of a variety of nonstandard items in relatively small batches.

Its purpose is to process goods and services that have a variety of functions. For instance, a 
typical machine shop generally has separate departments where machines are grouped by 
functions such as grinding, drilling, pressing, and lathing. Process layouts accommodate a 
variety of production functions and use general-purpose equipment that can be less costly to 
purchase and maintain than specialized equipment.
A product layout, also referred to as an assembly line, sets up production equipment along 
a product-flow line, and the work in process moves along this line past workstations. This 
type of layout efficiently produces large numbers of similar items, but it may prove inflexible 
and able to accommodate only a few product variations. Although product layouts date back 
at least to the Model T assembly line, companies are refining this approach with modern 
touches. Many auto manufacturers continue to use a product layout, but robots perform 
many of the activities that humans once performed. Automation overcomes one of the major 
drawbacks of this system—unlike humans, robots don’t get bored doing a dull, repetitive 
job. European automaker Holland Car Plc uses an assembly-line approach called complete 
knockdown (CKD), in which all the parts of an auto are imported in pieces to be welded, 
painted, and assembled at its facility in Ethiopia.14
A fixed-position layout places the product in one spot, and workers, materials, and equip-
ment come to it. This approach suits production of very large, bulky, heavy, or fragile 
products. For example, a bridge cannot be built on an assembly line. Fixed-position layouts 
dominate several industries including construction, shipbuilding, aircraft and aerospace, and 
oil drilling, to name a few. In all of these industries, the nature of the product generally dic-
tates a fixed-position layout.
Service organizations also must decide on appropriate layouts for their production pro-
cesses. A service firm should arrange its facilities to enhance the interactions between cus-
tomers and its services—also called customer-oriented layout. If you think of patients as inputs, 
a hospital implements a form of the process layout. Banks, libraries, dental offices, and hair 
salons also use process layouts. Sometimes the circumstances surrounding a service require 
a fixed-position layout. For instance, doctors, nurses, and medical devices are brought to 
patients in a hospital emergency room.
Implementing the Production Plan
After planning the production process and determining the best layout, a firm’s produc-
tion managers begin to implement the production plan. This activity involves (1) deciding 
whether to make, buy, or lease components; (2) selecting the best suppliers for materials; and 
(3) controlling inventory to keep enough, but not too much, on hand.
Make, Buy, or Lease Decision One of the fundamental issues facing every 
producer is the make, buy, or lease decision—choosing whether to manufacture a prod-
uct or component in house, purchase it from an outside supplier, or lease it. This decision is 
critical in many contemporary business situations.
Several factors affect the make, buy, or lease decision, including the costs of leasing or 
purchasing parts from vendors compared with the costs of producing them in house. The 
decision sometimes hinges on the availability of outside suppliers that can dependably meet 
a firm’s standards for quality and quantity. The need for confidentiality sometimes affects 
the decision, as does the short- or long-term duration of the firm’s need for supplies. A firm 
might not yet have the technology to produce certain components or materials, or the tech-
nology might be too costly. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. has teamed up with Genencor, an 
industrial biotechnology firm, to develop a cleaner alternative to the synthetic rubber now

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
For many years, tire manufacturers like Goodyear have relied on 
synthetic rubber as a supplement to the natural rubber used to make 
truck and automobile tires. The basis of synthetic rubber, produced on 
a global scale, is a chemical called isoprene, which is a volatile, toxic 
hydrocarbon that is a byproduct from refining crude oil. Isoprene is 
bad for the environment and its production relies on the availability of 
crude oil for refining. Until recently, there wasn’t a real alternative—
Goodyear still needed to purchase its raw materials for the manufacture 
of its tires, including the isoprene-based synthetic rubber. But research-
ers at Genencor, an industrial biotechnology firm headquartered in 
Rochester, New York, have come up with the answer—a way to pro-
duce synthetic rubber from sugar instead of refined oil waste. Goodyear 
is so convinced of this solution that the firm has established a collabo-
ration with Genencor.
 
“An intensive search has been underway for years for alterna-
tive sources of isoprene, in particular those from renewable resources 
such as biomass,” explains John McAuliffe, a scientist with Genencor. 
The method developed by Genencor involves the fermentation of sugar 
cane, corn, corn cobs, and switch grass to create a new product called 
BioIsoprene™, which will become the basis for synthetic rubber in the 
next few years. Goodyear, which makes 200 million tires annually, has 
been one of the world’s largest users of iosoprene—so the conversion 
to Genencor’s BioIsoprene™ will be significant.
 
“We want to make biochemicals from renewable materials,” 
notes McAuliffe, “partially as a hedge against rising crude oil prices 
and much more so because this approach moves us to a more sustain-
able future.” Genencor has made the first delivery of BioIsoprene™ 
to Goodyear, which will begin to incorporate it into its manufacturing 
process, resulting in greener tires that will hit the road soon. Both 
firms see the collaboration as a win–win for all, including consumers. 
“We believe it’s important to look at alternative renewable raw 
materials in our production processes,” says Jesse Roeck of Goodyear. 
“We chose to work with Genencor based on our strategy of open 
innovation because they are one of the leaders in industrial 
biotechnology.”

Even when the firm decides to purchase from outside vendors, production managers 
should maintain access to multiple supply sources. An alternative supplier ensures that the 
firm can obtain needed materials despite strikes, quality-assurance problems, or other situa-
tions that may affect inputs. Outsourcing has its disadvantages. The main reason companies 
say they use outsourcing is to reduce costs and focus on their core business activities, but 
outsourcing also may trigger layoffs and compromise quality.15
John Collier, president of Ohio-based M.O.M Tools, admits that outsourcing some 
of its tool production was a mistake. After experimenting with the process as a start-up, he 
decided that his company needed to obtain its own manufacturing facility. “You have a bet-
ter chance of controlling costs and maximizing profits if you build it yourself, starting from 
the ground up with raw materials,” Collier advises.16

Making the Most of Business Meetings
Some people love business meetings because they are a distraction from 
mundane tasks. Others ﬁ nd them tedious disruptions from more impor-
tant matters. But business meetings—no matter what your outlook—are 
sometimes necessary. If you view a business meeting as part of your overall 
networking strategy—including staff meetings, sales meetings, appointments 
with customers, or conferences with colleagues—you can put it to work for 
you as a genuine career builder. Here are a few tips for making the most of 
your next business meeting:
 • Be on time. Punctuality signiﬁ es that you value your own time as well as 
that of others. It also conveys the message that you intend to take the 
meeting seriously.
 • Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic devices. Unless you are a doctor on 
call for emergencies, there is no need to have your cell phone turned on. 
Beeps and ringtones are a distraction to those who are trying to concen-
trate, and indicate to other participants that your attention is elsewhere.
 • Pay attention. Listen actively to what others have to say. Take notes when 
appropriate.
 • Participate. While dominating a conversation is not advisable, ask relevant 
questions and make brief, applicable points when appropriate. Stay on 
the subject.
 • Conduct yourself professionally. Be polite to all other participants and be sure to 
thank them for their time at the end of the meeting.
 • Exchange business cards. At the conclusion of the meeting, be sure to ex-
change business cards or obtain contact information from participants 
with whom you wish to continue communication.

compare the quality, prices, dependability of 
delivery, and services offered by competing 
companies. Different suppliers may offer 
virtually identical quality levels and prices, so 
the final decision often rests on factors such 
as the firm’s experience with each supplier, 
speed of delivery, warranties on purchases, 
and other services.
For a major purchase, negotiations 
between the purchaser and potential vendors 
may stretch over several weeks or even months, 
and the buying decision may rest with a number 
of colleagues who must say yes before the final 
decision is made. The choice of a supplier for 
an industrial drill press, for example, may require 
a joint decision by the production, engineering, 
purchasing, and quality-control departments. 
These departments often must reconcile their 
different views to settle on a purchasing 
decision.
The Internet has given buyers powerful 
tools for finding and comparing suppliers. Buyers 
can log on to business exchanges to compare 
specifications, prices, and availability. Ariba, with 
headquarters in California, offers organizations 
online software and other tools that allow them to 
source $120 billion worth of goods and services 
from suppliers around the world.17
Firms often purchase raw materials and com-
ponent parts on long-term contracts. If a manufac-
turer requires a continuous supply of materials, a 
one-year or two-year contract with a vendor helps 
ensure availability. Today, many firms are building 
long-term relationships with suppliers and slash-
ing the number of companies with which they do 
business. At the same time, they are asking their 
vendors to expand their roles in the production 
process.
Networking provides a way for production 
managers to learn about suppliers and get to know 
them personally. Trade shows, conferences, and 
seminars, and other meetings enable managers to 
meet suppliers, competitors, and colleagues. The 
“Business Etiquette” feature provides tips for mak-
ing the most of these meetings.

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
inventory control requires them to balance the need to keep stock on hand to meet 
demand against the costs of carrying inventory. Among the expenses involved in storing 
inventory are warehousing costs, taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Firms waste money if 
they hold more inventory than they need. On the other hand, having too little inventory 
on hand may result in a shortage of raw materials, parts, or goods for sale that could lead to 
delays and unhappy customers.
Firms lose business when they consistently miss promised delivery dates or turn away 
orders. When Kansas farmer Jay Armstrong placed his order for a combine attachment—
just as his family had done for 50 years—the dealer told Armstrong he wouldn’t receive the 
equipment until August, when the farm’s growing season was nearly over. So Armstrong was 
forced to make his purchase from a competitor, who promised delivery in May.18
Efficient inventory control can save a great deal of money. Many firms maintain 
perpetual inventory systems to continuously monitor the amounts and locations of their stock. 
Such inventory control systems typically rely on computers, and many automatically generate 
orders at the appropriate times. Many supermarkets link their scanning devices to perpetual 
inventory systems that reorder needed merchandise without human interaction. As the sys-
tem records a shopper’s purchase, it reduces the inventory count stored in the computer. 
Once inventory on hand drops to a predetermined level, the system automatically reorders 
the merchandise. Roundy’s Supermarkets, headquartered in Wisconsin, uses a software sys-
tem called SoftGrocer Inventory Management throughout its 154-store chain to manage 
its stock. The system is responsible for ordering and receiving inventory as well as counting 
and picking inventory in stockrooms. In addition, the software updates and verifies perpetual 
inventory balances. The company CIO says the software has helped Roundy’s reduce its 
“out-of-stocks” while at the same time reducing “backroom and overall store inventory levels 
without impacting availability, which creates an immediate cost savings for our stores.”19
Some companies go further and hand over their inventory control functions to suppliers. 
This concept is known as vendor-managed inventory. Datalliance is an Ohio firm that creates 
software solutions for this kind of inventory management. One of its customers is Oatey, a 
leading manufacturer of plumbing products based in Ohio.20
Just-in-Time Systems A just-in-time (JIT) system implements a broad man-
agement philosophy that reaches beyond the narrow activity of inventory control to influ-
ence the entire system of production and operations management. A JIT system seeks to 
eliminate anything that does not add value in operations 
activities by providing the right part at the right place at 
just the right time—right before it is needed in production.
JIT systems are being used in a wide range of 
industries, including medical supplies. Seattle Children’s 
Hospital uses a JIT system to manage the distribution of 
its supplies, equipment, and clinical materials. The hospi-
tal partners with its key distributors to deploy the system. 
While the hospital does keep an inventory of certain emer-
gency supplies on hand, the rest are distributed on a JIT 
basis, saving the hospital more than $2.5 million in its 
first year.21
Production using JIT shifts much of the responsibility 
for carrying inventory to vendors, which operate on fore-
casts and keep stock on hand to respond to manufacturers’ 
needs. Suppliers that cannot keep enough high-quality

parts on hand may be assessed steep penalties by purchasers. Another risk of using JIT sys-
tems is what happens if manufacturers underestimate demand for a product. Strong demand 
will begin to overtax JIT systems, as suppliers and their customers struggle to keep up with 
orders with no inventory cushion to tide them over.
Materials Requirement Planning Besides efficiency, effective inventory 
control requires careful planning to ensure the firm has all the inputs it needs to make its 
products. How do production and operations managers coordinate all of this information? 
They rely on materials requirement planning (MRP), a computer-based production plan-
ning system that lets a firm ensure that it has all the parts and materials it needs to produce 
its output at the right time and place and in the right amounts.
Production managers use MRP programs to create schedules that identify the specific 
parts and materials required to produce an item. These schedules specify the exact quanti-
ties needed and the dates on which to order those quantities from suppliers so that they are 
delivered at the correct time in the production cycle. A small company might get by without 
an MRP system. If a firm makes a simple product with few components, a telephone call 
may ensure overnight delivery of crucial parts. For a complex product, however, such as a 
high-definition TV or aircraft, longer lead times are necessary.
The Allan Candy Company, a large Canadian candy manufacturer, uses MRP software 
from Microsoft to streamline and integrate all of its processes, determining materials needed 
and automatically generating purchase orders. CEO Steven Dakowsky believes this gives 
his firm a competitive edge in the candy market. “I believe in the power of technology and 
that it is a differentiating factor, especially for companies our size,” he says. “So, for me, it is 
critically important that we are ahead of the game.”22
Controlling the Production Process
The final task of production and operations managers is controlling the production 
process to maintain the highest possible quality. Production control creates a well-defined 
set of procedures for coordinating people, materials, and machinery to provide maximum 
production efficiency. Suppose that a watch factory must produce 80,000 watches during 
October. Production control managers break down this total into a daily production assign-
ment of 4,000 watches for each of the month’s 20 working days. Next, they determine the 
number of workers, raw materials, parts, and machines the plant needs to meet the produc-
tion schedule. Similarly, a manager in a service business such as a restaurant must estimate 
how many dinners the outlet will serve each day and then determine how many people are 
needed to prepare and serve the food, as well as what food to purchase.
Figure 10.5 illustrates production control as a five-step process composed of planning, 
routing, scheduling, dispatching, and follow-up. These steps are part of the firm’s overall 
emphasis on total quality management.
Production Planning
The phase of production control called production planning determines the amount of 
resources (including raw materials and other components) an organization needs to produce 
a certain output. The production planning process develops a bill of materials that lists all 
needed parts and materials. By comparing information about needed parts and materials

with the firm’s perpetual inventory data, purchasing staff can identify necessary purchases. 
Employees or automated systems establish delivery schedules to provide needed parts and 
materials when required during the production process. Production planning also ensures 
the availability of needed machines and personnel. At the Wilson Sporting Goods Company 
factory in Ohio, there’s a special excitement leading up to the Super Bowl each year: work-
ers there have made every football that was ever used in a Super Bowl game. Each January, 
construction on the balls begins; the footballs are about 70 percent complete before the 
final playoff games are decided. But when the clock ticks down on those final games—and 
workers know which two team names will be printed on the balls—production goes into 
overdrive. The plant makes about 120 official game balls and around 6,000 replicas for sale 
to fans. “The market determines how many balls we will make,” notes Gregory Miller, the 
plant controller.23
Although material inputs contribute to service-production systems, production planning 
for services tends to emphasize human resources more than materials.
Routing
Another phase of production control, called routing, determines the sequence of work 
throughout the facility and specifies who will perform each aspect of the work at what loca-
tion. Routing choices depend on two factors: the nature of the good or service and the facil-
ity layouts discussed earlier in the chapter—product, process, fixed position, or customer 
oriented. JETCAM is a firm headquartered in Monaco that provides routing software to the 
aerospace composite industry, in which quality and accuracy is absolutely critical. One fea-
ture of the software is that it allows instructions for processes to be provided automatically 
instead of keyed in by workers—thus avoiding errors.24
Scheduling
In the scheduling phase of production control, managers develop timetables that specify 
how long each operation in the production process takes and when workers should perform 
it. Efficient scheduling ensures that production will meet delivery schedules and make effi-
cient use of resources.
Scheduling is important whether the product is complex or simple to produce and 
whether it is a tangible good or a service. A pencil is simpler to produce than a computer, 
but each production process has scheduling requirements. A stylist may take 25 minutes 
to complete each haircut with just one or two tools, whereas every day a hospital has to 
schedule procedures and treatments ranging from X-rays to surgery to follow-up

appointments. Sleepmaster is a medium-sized firm that recently moved some 
of its production offshore from its Australian headquarters to China. The 
company’s MRP system not only had little capacity for scheduling, workers 
in China did not know how to use the technology. So Sleepmaster’s opera-
tions manager implemented a new scheduling program called Resource 
Manager because it was more intuitive to use; it was easy to configure; it 
cost little to operate; and support was available via Skype.25
Production managers use a number of analytical methods for schedul-
ing. One of the oldest methods, the Gantt chart, tracks projected and actual 
work progress over time. Gantt charts like the one in Figure 10.6 remain 
popular because they show at a glance the status of a particular project. 
However, they are most effective for scheduling relatively simple projects.
A complex project might require a PERT (program evaluation and review 
technique) chart, which seeks to minimize delays by coordinating all aspects 
of the production process. First developed for the military, PERT has been 
modified for industry. The simplified PERT diagram in Figure 10.7 sum-
marizes the schedule for purchasing and installing a new robot in a factory. 
The heavy gold line indicates the critical path—the sequence of operations 
that requires the longest time for completion. In this case, the project can-
not be completed in fewer than 17 weeks.
In practice, a PERT network may consist of thousands of events and 
cover months of time. Complex computer programs help production man-
agers develop such a network and find the critical path among the maze of 
events and activities. The construction of a huge office building requires 
complex production planning of this nature.
Dispatching
Dispatching is the phase of production control in which management instructs each 
department on what work to do and the time allowed for its completion. The dispatcher 
authorizes performance, provides instructions, and lists job priorities. Dispatching may be 
the responsibility of a manager or a self-managed work team.

Because even the best plans sometimes fail, production managers need to be aware of 
any problems. Follow-up is the phase of production control in which managers and employ-
ees or team members spot problems in the production process and come up with solutions. 
Problems take many forms: machinery malfunctions, delayed shipments, and employee 
absenteeism can all affect production. The production control system must detect and report 
these delays to managers or work teams so they can adjust schedules and correct the under-
lying problems.
Importance of Quality
Quality—as it relates to the production of goods and services—is defined as being free 
of deficiencies. Quality matters because fixing, replacing, or redesigning deficient products 
is costly. If Seagate makes a defective computer hard drive, it has to either fix the drive or 
replace it to keep a customer happy. If American Airlines books too many passengers for a 
flight, it has to offer vouchers worth several hundred dollars to encourage passengers to give 
up their seats and take a later flight.
For most companies, the costs of poor quality can amount to 20 percent of sales rev-
enue, if not more. Some typical costs of poor quality include downtime, repair costs, rework, 
and employee turnover. Poor quality can also result in lost sales and a tarnished image. 
Facebook experienced a quality crisis when users were confused and upset about its imple-
mentation of new privacy settings that created chaos and dissatisfaction. “Many of you 
thought our controls were too complex,” wrote CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a letter to users. 
“Our intention was to give you lots of granular controls, but that may not have been what 
many of you wanted. We just missed the mark.”26
One process that companies use to ensure that they produce high-quality products 
from the start is benchmarking—determining how well other companies perform

business functions or tasks. In other words, benchmarking is the process of determining 
other firms’ standards and best practices. Automobile companies routinely purchase each 
other’s cars and then take them completely apart to examine and compare the design, 
components, and materials used to make even the smallest part. They then make 
improvements to match or exceed the quality found in their competitors’ cars. Companies 
may use many different benchmarks, depending on their objectives. For instance, some 
organizations that want to make more money may compare their operating profits or 
expenses to those of other firms. Retailers concerned with productivity may want to 
benchmark sales per square foot.
It’s important when benchmarking for a firm to establish what it wants to accomplish, 
what it wants to measure, and which company can provide the most useful benchmarking 
information. A firm might choose a direct competitor for benchmarking, or it might select 
a company in an entirely different industry—but one that has processes the firm wants to 
study and emulate.27
Quality Control
Quality control involves measuring output against established quality standards. Firms 
need such checks to spot defective products and to avoid delivering inferior shipments to 
customers. Standards should be set high enough to meet customer expectations. A 90 or 95 
percent success rate might seem to be a good number, but consider what your phone service 
or ATM network would be like if it worked only 90 percent of the time. You would feel 
frustrated and inconvenienced, and would probably switch your account to another bank or 
service provider.
Manufacturing firms can monitor quality levels through visual inspections, electronic 
sensors, robots, and X-rays. Surveys can provide quality-control information to services. 
Negative feedback from customers or a high rejection rate on a product or component sends 
a signal that production is not achieving quality standards. Firms that outsource operations 
may face a greater challenge in monitoring quality and assuring customers of the quality of 
their goods or services, especially if they are highly visible companies such as airlines. The 
“Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature discusses recent concerns over the quality of multi-
vitamins manufactured for U.S. companies by facilities in China.
Because the typical factory can spend up to half its operating budget identifying and 
fixing mistakes, a company cannot rely solely on inspections to achieve its quality goals. 
Instead, quality-driven production managers identify all processes involved in producing 
goods and services and work to maximize their efficiency. The causes of problems in the 
processes must be found and eliminated. If a company concentrates its efforts on better 
designs of products and processes with clear quality targets, it can ensure virtually 
defect-free production.
General Electric, Heinz, 3M, Sears, and the U.S. military are just a few of the grow-
ing number of major organizations using the Six Sigma concept to achieve quality goals. Six 
Sigma means a company tries to make error-free products 99.9997 percent of the time—a 
tiny 3.4 errors per million opportunities. The goal of Six Sigma programs is for companies 
to eliminate virtually all defects in output, processes, and transactions. Motorola—also a Six 
Sigma firm—recently completed an initiative to redesign and simplify much of its software 
architecture in order to improve operational efficiencies and cut costs by reducing redundant 
IT applications.28

Chinese manufacturing seems to be plagued by quality control 
issues, ranging from contamination of pet food and baby food to 
the paint on children’s toys. Now it’s multivitamins, which reportedly 
contain dangerous levels of lead and toxic bacteria—and are showing 
up in U.S. stores. In response, some legislators have called for stricter 
quality standards. Some vitamin firms have decided to seize the oppor-
tunity and source their ingredients elsewhere. One firm has begun 
offering Opurity, a new premium multivitamin whose ingredients come 
from other countries, labeling the bottle “China Free.”
Should tighter quality controls be placed on Chinese 
manufacturing of U.S. goods?
Summary
A former senior official at the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) points out that the FDA doesn’t have 
enough inspectors to identify all the quality violations—so the incidence of contamination may be much 
higher than is already known. At the very least, the origin of ingredients in multivitamins should be made 
known to consumers so they can make their own choice about which vitamins to buy. For those who want 
assurance that the vitamins they purchase are free of ingredients sourced from China, products like Opurity 
are available.

PRO
1. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, 85 percent of 
Chinese citizens rank quality concerns high for food and drugs made 
in their own country. Tighter controls would not only benefit U.S. and 
European consumers, they would benefit Chinese consumers as well.
2. Vitamins that are stamped “Made in Germany” or “Made in the 
USA” might still contain ingredients from China. Because it has already 
been demonstrated that these products contain high levels of toxic sub-
stances, tighter quality controls must be put into place.
CON
1. Many vitamins contain ingredients from multiple sources, so it is 
impossible to target China as the sole source of contamination.
2. Chinese production offers companies good value—labor and 
other services are far less expensive than in other countries, savings 
that can be passed along to the consumer.
Multivitamins Produced in China: Are Stricter Quality Controls 
Necessary?
ISO Standards
For many goods and services, an important measure of quality is to meet the standards 
of the International Organization for Standardization, known as ISO for short—not 
an acronym but a shorter name derived from the Greek word isos, meaning “equal.” 
Operating since 1947, ISO is a network of national standards bodies from 163 countries . 
Its mission is to develop and promote International Standards for business, government 
and society to facilitate global trade and cooperation. ISO has developed voluntary 
standards for everything from the format of banking and telephone cards to freight

containers to paper sizes to metric screw threads. The U.S. 
member body of ISO is the American National Standards 
Institute.
The ISO 9000 family of standards give requirements and 
guidance for quality management to help organizations ensure 
that their products and services achieve customer 
satisfaction and also provide a framework for continual 
improvement. The ISO 14000 family of standards for envi-
ronmental management helps organizations to ensure that 
their operations cause minimal harm to the environment and 
to achieve continual improvement of their environmental 
performance.
ISO 9001_2008 and ISO 14001:2004 respectively give 
the requirements for a quality management system and an 
environmental management system. Both can be used for 
certification, which means that the organization’s management 
system (the way it manages its processes) is independently 
audited by a certification body (also known in North American 
as a registration body, or registrar) and confirmed as conform-
ing to the requirements of the standard. The organization is 
then issued with an ISO 9001:2008 or an ISO 14001:2004 
certificate.
It should be noted that certification is not a requirement of either standard, which 
can be implemented solely for the benefits it provides the organization and its customers. 
However, many organizations opt to seek certification because of the perception that an 
independent audit adds confidence in its abilities. Business partners, 
customers, suppliers and consumers may prefer to deal with or buy products and services 
from a certified organization. Certifications have to be periodically renewed through 
accompanying audits. 
A second point is that ISO itself develops standards but does not itself carry out audit-
ing and certification. This is done independently of ISO by hundreds of certification bodies 
around the world. The certificates they issue carry their own logo, but not ISO’s because the 
latter does not approve or control their activities. 
Whether or not an organization decides to seek certification of its management system, 
many have reported significant benefits from implementing ISO’s mananagement system 
standards, such as increased efficiency, better teamwork, improved customer satisfaction and 
reduced consumption of resources.29

Summary of Learning Objectives
Explain the strategic importance of the production 
function.
Production and operations management is a vital business 
function. Without a quality good or service, a company can-
not create profits, and it soon fails. The production proc-
ess is also crucial in a not-for-profit organization, because 
the good or service it produces justifies the organization’s 
existence. Production and operations management plays an 
important strategic role by lowering the costs of production, 
boosting output quality, and allowing the firm to respond 
flexibly and dependably to customers’ demands.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 What is mass production? Mass production is a sys-
tem for manufacturing products in large quantities through 
effective combinations of employees with specialized skills, 
mechanization, and standardization.
1.2 What is the difference between flexible production 
and customer-driven production? Flexible production 
generally involves using technology to receive and fulfill 
orders and skilled people to carry out tasks needed to fill 
a particular order. Customer-driven production evaluates 
customer demands in order to make the connection between 
products manufactured and products bought.
Identify and describe the four main categories of produc-
tion processes.
The four main categories of production processes are the 
analytic production system, which reduces a raw material to 
its component parts in order to extract one or more market-
able products; the synthetic production system, which com-
bines a number of raw materials or parts to produce finished 
products; the continuous production process, which gener-
ates finished products over a lengthy period of time; and the 
intermittent production process, which generates products in 
short production runs.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 What are the two main production systems? The two 
systems are analytic production and synthetic production.
2.2 What are the two time-related production pro-
cesses? The two time-related production processes are the 
continuous production process and the intermittent produc-
tion process.
Explain the role of technology in the production process.
Computer-driven automation allows companies to design, 
create, and modify products rapidly and produce them 
in ways that effectively meet customers’ changing needs. 
Important design and production technologies include 
robots, computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided man-
ufacturing (CAM), and computer-integrated manufacturing 
(CIM). Many firms are pouring resources into the develop-
ment of manufacturing processes that result in a reduction 
of waste, energy use, and pollution.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 List some of the reasons businesses invest in robots. 
Businesses use robots to free people from sometimes danger-
ous assignments and to move heavy items from one place to 
another in a factory.
3.2 What is a flexible manufacturing system (FMS)? An 
FMS is a production facility that workers can quickly modify 
to manufacture different products.
3.3 What are the major benefits of computer-integrated 
manufacturing (CIM)? The main benefits are increased 
productivity, decreased design costs, increased equipment 
utilization, and improved quality.
Identify the factors involved in a plant location decision.
Criteria for choosing the best site for a production facil-
ity fall into three categories: transportation, human, and 
physical factors. Transportation factors include proximity to 
markets and raw materials, along with availability of trans-
portation alternatives. Physical variables involve such issues 
as water supply, available energy, and options for disposing 
of hazardous wastes. Human factors include the area’s labor 
supply, local regulations, taxes, and living conditions.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 How does an environmental impact study influence 
the location decision? An environmental impact study 
influences the location decision because it studies how trans-
portation, energy use, water and sewer treatment needs, and 
other factors will affect plants, wildlife, water, air, and other 
features of the natural environment.
4.2 What human factors are relevant to the location 
decision? Human factors include an area’s labor supply, 
labor costs, local regulations, taxes, and living conditions.
Explain the major tasks of production and operations man-
agers, and outline the three activities involved in imple-
menting the production plan.
Production and operations managers use people and 
machinery to convert inputs (materials and resources) into 
finished goods and services. Four major tasks are involved. 
First, the managers must plan the overall production proc-
ess. Next, they must pick the best layout for their facilities. 
Then they implement their production plans. Finally, they 
control the production process and evaluate results to main-
tain the highest possible quality.
Implementation involves deciding whether to make, buy, 
or lease components; selecting the best suppliers for materi-
als; and controlling inventory to keep enough, but not too 
much, on hand.

Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 List the four major tasks of production and opera-
tions managers. The four tasks are planning overall pro-
duction, laying out the firm’s facilities, implementing the 
production plan, and controlling manufacturing to achieve 
high quality.
5.2 What is the difference between a traditional manu-
facturing structure and a team-based structure? In the 
traditional structure, each manager is given a specific area of 
authority. In a team-based structure, all workers are respon-
sible for their output.
5.3 What factors affect the make, buy, or lease decision? 
The costs of leasing or purchasing parts from vendors, ver-
sus producing them in house, the availability of dependable 
outside suppliers, and the need for confidentiality affect this 
decision.
Identify the steps in the production control process.
The production control process consists of five steps: plan-
ning, routing, scheduling, dispatching, and follow-up. 
Quality control is an important consideration throughout 
this process. Coordination of each of these phases should 
result in high production efficiency and low production 
costs.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 What five steps are involved in controlling the 
production process? The five steps are planning, routing, 
scheduling, dispatching, and follow-up.
6.2 What is the difference between a PERT chart and a 
Gantt chart? PERT charts, which seek to minimize delays 
by coordinating all aspects of the production process, are 
used for more complex projects; Gantt charts, which track 
projected and actual work progress over time, are used for 
scheduling relatively simple projects.
Discuss the importance of quality control.
Quality control involves evaluating goods and services 
against established quality standards. Such checks are 
necessary to spot defective products and to see that they 
are not shipped to customers. Devices for monitoring 
quality levels of the firm’s output include visual inspection, 
electronic sensors, robots, and X-rays. Companies 
are increasing the quality of their goods and services by 
using Six Sigma techniques and by becoming ISO 9000 
and 14000 certified.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 What are some ways in which a company can moni-
tor the quality level of its output? Benchmarking, quality 
control, Six Sigma, and ISO standards are ways of monitor-
ing quality.
7.2 List some of the benefits of acquiring ISO 9000 
certification. These standards define how a company should 
ensure that its products meet customers’ requirements. 
Studies show that customers prefer to buy from companies 
that are ISO 9000 certified.

Chapter 10  Production and Operations Management
Macedonia: The New Hub of Apparel Manufacturing?
Case 10.1
If you have to look twice on a map to find the 
Republic of Macedonia, you’re probably not alone. But the 
small country with a population of about 2 million, nestled 
in the heart of eastern Europe (sharing borders with 
Bulgaria, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, and Greece), is becom-
ing a hotbed of apparel manufacturing. Although textiles 
and clothing already make up one of the largest industries 
in this country, Macedonian manufacturers are pushing for 
more, claiming that their factories are working at only half 
their capacity.
Currently, Macedonian factories are equipped to 
fulfill cut-make and cut-make-trim orders, but the goal 
is to offer full-package production, including design and 
domestic fabric procurement. “We need customers to 
move their design and product development here, so we 
become their partners in production, offering a fast, flex-
ible approach and something cheaper than the client is 
used to,” says Vladimir Icokaev, a manager at textile and 
clothing exporter Global Plus.
Macedonian factories already supply major European 
brands and retailers with everything from jackets and 
coats to skirts, pants, and shirts. The 500 textile and 
clothing firms in Macedonia are generally small by inter-
national standards—most employ from 30 to 500 work-
ers. However, what they can’t provide in volume they can 
offer in flexibility. Competitors from countries as nearby as 
Bulgaria and as far away as China and India are focusing 
on mass production, offering high volume at the low-
est cost. Macedonian manufacturers, on the other hand, 
prefer to focus on short production runs and high quality. 
“If buyers want capacity they can get it anywhere in the 
world,” says Ilijev Nikolco, general manager for manufac-
turer INT, which provides a range of services from design 
through finished garments. “The future for Macedonia is 
exclusively in higher quality, more complicated styles and 
lower lead times.”
Unlike the competitive environment found in other 
countries, many of the small manufacturers in Macedonia 
work together to serve the same customers. “The appeal 
for buyers and retailers is that they can deal with one fac-
tory that has a network to put garments out to individual 
suppliers—a one-stop shop,” notes Gabriela Pavloska, 
export manager at Okitex, a women’s wear company that 
is headquartered in Germany. Okitex actually works with 
20 factories in Macedonia to produce a complete collec-
tion of women’s items—coats, blazers, blouses, and the 
like. “Our idea is to combine factories to provide a source 
because a client doesn’t just want one type of garment,” 
explains Pavloska.
Location is another factor that works in Macedonia’s 
favor, particularly with its European customers. Delivery to 
the United Kingdom takes about three days, to Germany 
about two days. In addition, Macedonia is located near 
the high-end fabric producers in Turkey and Italy. So 
the average lead time from receipt of fabric to delivery 
of a product is around three weeks. The small, flexible 
Macedonian factories can easily produce minimum orders 
of just 100 pieces per style and color—and have them at 
a customer’s doorstep anywhere in western Europe in less 
than a month.
Macedonia still has some obstacles to overcome. 
Workers do not always have the necessary technical skills, 
and Macedonia is not yet a member of the European 
Union. But some factories are sending workers to Germany 
and other countries for training, and the country recently 
held an international business event sponsored by USAID 
(the U.S. Agency for International Development) and the 
Macedonian Competitiveness Project. During the event, 
a group of 29 manufacturers showcased their capabilities 
to buyers that included such popular European brands as 
Topshop, Monsoon, Whistles, and BMB Clothing. Buyers 
were surprised—and impressed—by the facilities, the 
quality, the flexibility, and the easy location of Macedonian 
manufacturers. “It really is a brilliant way to meet a new 
manufacturing partner,” said Leonie Barrie, an industry 
expert. So the next time you buy an item of clothing, 
check the label—it might read, “Made in Macedonia.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Do you think Macedonia’s strategy of focusing 
on flexibility, quality, and proximity rather than 
trying to compete with the high-volume, low-
price strategy of its rivals will be successful in 
the long run? Why or why not?
2. How might Macedonian apparel manufacturers 
attract U.S. buyers?

returns. Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, wants you to be 
happy. He wants to you be happy with your shoes, and if 
you’re not, he wants to make returns easy for you. This 
is because he wants you to come back and order more 
shoes—which you probably will. Hsieh believes that the 
best way to attract and keep customers is to “wow” them 
with customer service. It’s a formula that works—Zappos 
reports that nearly 75 percent of its business comes from 
repeat customers.
Although Zappos is now owned by Amazon, and 
has also grown to offer apparel, accessories, and other 
products, the company’s commitment to customer service 
has not changed. Delivering top service, which includes 
fulfilling and shipping orders as quickly as possible, is 
a significant part of Zappos’ production function. While 
Internet and other computer technology helps speed deliv-
ery and turnaround time, it also sets the bar higher than 
ever before. One survey recently revealed that consumers 
would be willing to pay nearly 11 percent more for supe-
rior customer service at online shopping sites. “Due to the 
seemingly distant and remote nature of online shopping, it 
makes sense that consumers would pay a higher premium 
to have the comfort and peace of mind that they will be 
taken care of in the case of a serious question, concern or 
problem,” concluded the survey.
Customer service is also an investment in quality. 
Zappos currently has a Customer Loyalty department 
staffed by 380 employees whose job it is to communicate 
among the different departments of the company and with 
customers. The customer loyalty team interfaces with the 
resource desk, order verification (anti-fraud team), qual-
ity assurance, kaizen (continuous training), and e-mail/
live chat, along with other departments as necessary. 
Customer loyalty team members have the authority to 
send individual customers personal notes or request flow-
ers for a wedding or anniversary celebration. They don’t 
need to ask permission to issue refunds or coupons or to 
give out their contact information. At Zappos, the outlook 
is that everyone is a customer and should be treated with 
respect.
Constant improvement is also part of the company 
culture. “Let’s take our learnings and improve, con-
stantly,” says marketing chief Aaron Magness. “If we 
rest, we’ll be passed by the next more hungry business.” 
Tony Hsieh agrees, adding that it is necessary to embrace 
change, recognizing opportunities in the industry and the 
marketplace. The formula must work—Zappos rakes in 
more than $1 billion each year selling shoes online to cus-
tomers who haven’t even tried them on to see if they can 
wiggle their toes.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Explain how customer service fulfills a signifi-
cant portion of Zappos’ production function.
2. What kind of firm might Zappos use for bench-
marking? Why?

Kimpton Hotels Puts Green Initiatives to Work
CASE 1.3
Case 10.3
It’s one thing for a company to talk about green 
initiatives; it’s quite another for the firm to put those 
initiatives into practice. Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants 
began putting green initiatives to work in its hotels and 
restaurants nearly thirty years ago, long before these 
practices became popular. Of course, it’s the operations 
function of the business that implements this type of plan; 
it’s the hotel manager, the dishwasher in the restaurant, 
the housekeeping staff, the front desk clerk. “How we do 
what we do defines us,” observes NikiLeondakis, COO of 

345
Chapter 10  Production and Operations Management
Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, which runs 50 boutique-
styleluxury hotels and restaurants across the U.S.
Although Kimpton began its green practices long ago, 
in 2005 the company launched a company-wide program 
called EarthCare in order to standardize these practices 
across all of its hotels and restaurants. Frank Kawecki, 
director of operations for KimptonRestaurants in the 
Northeast, recalls that Kimpton’s green efforts started first 
in the restaurants with the chefs, then spread. When the 
EarthCare program began, the company asked for volun-
teers from each property who were devoted to the green 
effort because they were already committed to the idea 
and could communicate best between management and 
staff. Volunteers ranged from bartenders to general man-
agers who were willing to meet once a month. One of the 
first initiatives—which came from restaurant servers—was 
to eliminate imported bottled water, shifting instead to 
locally bottled water and the use of recycled water bottles.
As EarthCare has expanded throughout the company, 
standard guidelines have been set for nearly every facet of 
the firm’s operation. Home office materials and procedures 
include shifting to online publication of many documents; 
using post-consumer recycled paper and eco-friendly inks 
for those documents that are printed; making hotel key-
cards from recycled plastic; offering continuous education 
in green initiatives for staff, and more. At the hotels them-
selves, all hotel in-room materials and bills are printed on 
recycled paper; phone books are offered by request only; 
all plumbing is water-efficient; lighting is LED or CFL, and 
subject to motion sensors; rooms are stocked with green-
certified linens and towels; guest room soaps are made of 
natural ingredients, and carpet cleaning is done with non-
toxic products. If the list seems endless, it nearly is—and 
the complexity of the operations management required to 
implement standards such as these is daunting.
Waste management is a category unto itself, with 
hotel and restaurant-wide recycling and reuse of every-
thing from cardboard and paper to batteries and comput-
ers. Restaurants in particular present a huge challenge. 
“There’s an enormous amount of waste from a lot of 
restaurants,” observes Frank Kawecki. “A lot of it can be 
composted, recycled, or reused. There can be a 40-percent 
savings in waste removal. Waste removal was tradition-
ally a fixed expense that we have manipulated,” through 
EarthCare. In addition to reducing waste and energy use, 
Kimpton restaurants purchase and serve as many certified 
organic products as possible, ranging from local produce 
and seafood to coffee, tea, and wine.
Saving the planet can be expensive. Running a 
business incurs costs as well. One of the challenges of 
implementing the EarthCare program is monitoring costs. 
“Green efforts can’t compromise the experience for our 
guests and it can’t cost our shareholders more money. If 
we go out of business, saving the planet as hoteliers goes 
away,” notes NikiLeondakis. “So that premise was very 
good in helping us decide what we would tackle first—
water savings, energy savings.” Whatever is good for the 
planet has to be good for the bottom line. One way that 
Kimpton Hotels meets this goal is by looking at ways for 
certain costs to off-set each other. If purchasing recycled 
paper costs more, there might be a way to find savings in 
another area. “We put measurements on all of our efforts 
to see what impact they have on the bottom line,” says 
Leondakis. “We’ve still been able to say that it saves us 
money.”
Recently Kimpton Hotels announced its plan to seek 
third-party Green Seal certification on all 50 of its proper-
ties; ten properties have already been certified. Green Seal 
certification involves an application process and evaluation 
similar to LEED certification, which the company is also 
seeking for its new or renovated properties. “It will be an 
ongoing work in progress forever,” predicts Leondakis. But 
Kimpton Hotels has a head start.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Location is certainly a production factor for 
Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, which are 
located in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, 
Boston, Chicago, and Seattle. What location fac-
tors might Kimpton managers consider when 
thinking about whether to acquire or build a 
new Kimpton hotel and restaurant?
2. According to the EarthCare program, what fac-
tors might a Kimpton restaurant chef or man-
ager consider when selecting suppliers?
3. A daily staff meeting at a Kimpton hotel can be 
considered part of production control, contrib-
uting to the smooth running of the hotel. Who 
might attend such a meeting? What kinds of 
topics might they discuss?
4. Quality is top priority at Kimpton Hotels & 
Restaurants. What steps can a Kimpton hotel 
manager take to balance quality and the initia-
tives of the EarthCare program?

PART 3

Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
“This is a stepping stone for me,” thought Greensburg’s 
town administrator, Steve Hewitt. Hewitt, who had grown 
up in Greensburg, had moved back home and taken a posi-
tion in the tiny rural town of 1,500. Standing in what was left 
of his kitchen on the night of Friday, May 4, 2007, he real-
ized he had gotten more than he bargained for.
Across town, Mayor Lonnie McCollum and his wife had 
survived by clinging to a mattress as the storm ravaged their 
home. A write-in candidate in the past election, McCollum 
had accepted the job and set out to revive the dying town. 
Among his many ideas, the most innovative had been green 
building. McCollum was no tree-hugger; he was simply look-
ing for a way to save money on fuel and utilities, to conserve 
the town’s resources.
Like many people in town, Hewitt and McCollum had 
no idea of the extent of the damage. They would later learn 
that the two-mile-wide F5 tornado drove right through the 
two-mile-wide town. By the end of the weekend, though, 
they knew that Greensburg was gone. At a press conference, 
McCollum announced that the town would rebuild, and 
would do it using green technology.
By May 2008, the town was on its third mayor since the 
disaster, but Steve Hewitt was still the town administrator. 
He had expanded his staff from 20 to 35 people, establish-
ing a full-time fire department, a planning department, and 
a community development department. Each week Hewitt 
spent hours giving interviews to reporters from all over the 
world. “He’s very open as far as information,” said Recovery 
Coordinator and Assistant Town Administrator Kim 
Alderfer. “He’s very good about delegating authority. He 
gives you the authority to do your job. He doesn’t have time 
to micromanage.”
Meanwhile, residents Janice and John Haney had rebuilt 
their family farm on the outskirts of town. Although their 
new home, an earth berm structure, was full of energy-
efficient features, Janice wasn’t convinced that the plan to 
rebuild Greensburg using green technology was the right 
one. “I do worry that it will be a T-shirt slogan,” said Haney. 
“I personally don’t think the persons that are living in 
Greensburg right now are really committed to it. We didn’t 
have a choice. You MUST go green. That’s really not every-
body’s option.” She added that many people feared higher 
taxes would force some families out of town.
Questions
After viewing the video, answer the following questions:
1. What kind of leader is Steve Hewitt?
2. How would you describe Greensburg’s culture?
3. Do you believe that as town administrator, Hewitt had 
the right to impose green building codes on residents 
and businesses?
4. Perform a SWOT analysis of Greensburg’s green initiative.

L A U N C H I N G  Y O U R 
Launching Your 
Management Career
Part 3, “Management: 
Empowering People to Achieve 
Business Objectives,” covers Chapters 
7 through 10, which discuss manage-
ment, leadership, and the internal 
organization; human resource man-
agement, motivation, and labor–
management relations; improving 
performance through empowerment, 
teamwork, and communication; and 
production and operations manage-
ment. In those chapters, you read 
about top executives and company 
founders who not only direct their 
companies’ strategy but lead oth-
ers in their day-to-day tasks to keep 
them on track, middle managers who 
devise plans to turn the strategies into 
realities, and supervisors who work 
directly with employees to create 
strong teams that satisfy customers. 
An incredible variety of jobs is avail-
able to those choosing management 
careers. And the demand for manag-
ers will continue to grow. The U.S. 
Department of Labor estimates that 
managerial jobs will grow by nearly 
15 percent over the next decade.1
So what kinds of jobs might you 
be able to choose from if you launch 
a management career? As you learned 
in Chapter 7, three types of manage-
ment jobs exist: supervisory managers, 
middle managers, and top managers. 
Supervisory management, or first-line 
management, includes positions such 
as supervisor, office manager, depart-
ment manager, section chief, and 
team leader. Managers at this level 
work directly with the employees who 
produce and sell a firm’s goods and 
services.
Middle management includes 
positions such as general managers, 
plant managers, division manag-
ers, and regional or branch manag-
ers. They are responsible for setting 
objectives consistent with top man-
agement’s goals and planning and 
implementing strategies for achieving 
those objectives.
Top managers include such posi-
tions as chief executive officer (CEO), 
chief operating officer (COO), chief 
financial officer (CFO), chief infor-
mation officer (CIO), and executive 
vice president. Top managers devote 
most of their time to developing 
long-range plans, setting a direction 
for their organization, and inspiring a 
company’s executives and employees 
to achieve their vision for the com-
pany’s future. Top managers travel 
frequently between local, national, 
and global offices as they meet and 
work with customers, suppliers, and 
company managers and employees.
Most managers start their careers 
in areas such as sales, production, or 
finance, so you likely will start in a 
similar entry-level job. If you do that 
job and other jobs well, you may be 
considered for a supervisory position. 
Then, if you are interested and have 
the technical, human, and conceptual 
skills to succeed, you’ll begin your 
management career path. But what 
kinds of supervisory management jobs 
are typically available? Let’s review 
the exciting possibilities.
Administrative services managers 
manage basic services—such as cleri-
cal work, payroll, travel, printing and 
copying, data records, telecommunica-
tions, security, parking, and supplies—
without which no organization could 
operate. On average, administrative 
service managers earn $75,000 a year.2
Construction managers plan, sched-
ule, and coordinate the building of 
homes, commercial buildings such as 
offices and stores, and industrial facili-
ties such as manufacturing plants and 
distribution centers. Unlike admin-
istrative service managers, who work 
in offices, construction managers 
typically work on building sites with 
architects, engineers, construction 
workers, and suppliers. On average, 
construction managers earn almost 
$78,000 a year.3
Food service managers run res-
taurants and services that prepare 
and offer meals to customers. They 
coordinate workers and suppliers in 
kitchens, dining areas, and banquet 
operations; are responsible for those 
who order and purchase food inven-
tories; maintain kitchen equipment; 
and recruit, hire, and train new work-
ers. Food service managers can work 
for chains such as Ruby Tuesday or 
Olive Garden, for local restaurants, 
and for corporate food service depart-
ments in organizations. On average, 

348
Part 3  Management: Empowering People to Achieve Business
food service managers earn more than 
$49,500 a year.4
Human resource managers help 
organizations follow federal and local 
labor laws; effectively recruit, hire, 
train, and retain talented workers; 
administer corporate pay and benefits 
plans; develop and administer organi-
zational human resource policies; and, 
when necessary, participate in con-
tract negotiations or handle disputes. 
Human resource management jobs 
vary widely, depending on how special-
ized the requirements are. On average, 
human resource managers earn from 
$45,000 to $96,000 a year, depending 
on the area in which they specialize.5
Lodging managers work in hotels 
and motels but also help run camps, 
ranches, and recreational resorts. 
They may oversee guest services, 
front desk, kitchen, restaurant, ban-
quet, house cleaning, and maintenance 
workers. Because they are expected 
to help satisfy customers around the 
clock, they often work long hours and 
may be on call when not at work. On 
average, lodging managers earn about 
$45,000 a year.6
Medical and health services managers 
work in hospitals, nursing homes, doc-
tors’ offices, and corporate and uni-
versity settings. They run departments 
that offer clinical services; ensure that 
state and federal laws are followed; 
and handle decisions related to the 
management of patient care, nursing, 
surgery, therapy, medical records, and 
financial payments. On average, medi-
cal and health service managers earn 
$75,000 a year.7
Purchasing managers lead and con-
trol organizational supply chains that 
ensure that companies have needed 
materials to produce the goods and 
services they sell, purchase materi-
als at reasonable prices, and oversee 
deliveries when and where they are 
needed. Purchasing managers work 
with wholesale and retail buyers, 
buying goods that are then resold to 
others; purchasing agents, who buy 
supplies and raw materials for their 
organizations; and contract specialists, 
who negotiate and supervise purchas-
ing contracts with key suppliers and 
vendors. On average, purchasing man-
agers earn nearly $89,000 a year.8
Production managers direct and 
coordinate operations that manufac-
ture goods. They work with employ-
ees who produce parts and assemble 
products, help determine which new 
machines should be purchased and 
when existing machines need mainte-
nance, and are responsible for achiev-
ing production goals that specify the 
quality, cost, schedule, and quantity 
of units to be produced. On average, 
production managers earn almost 
$83,000 a year.9

 Handmade Items: Etsy.com Has 
Them All
 U nique, handmade items have always been 
popular alternatives to mass-market products. Not 
very long ago, many physically carried their creations 
to craft fairs or sold them through networks of 
friends and associates. Some still do, of course, but 
now they also have access to potentially unlimited 
global markets through Web sites such as Artfire, 
1000 Markets, and Etsy.
Unlike eBay, where independent artisans must 
compete directly with mass producers or importers, 
sites such as Etsy cater to customers who are 
looking for a one-of-a-kind, handmade piece of 
jewelry or quilt or pair of hand-carved wooden 
bookends. Artisans can set up online “shops” at 
these sites; many have shops at more than one 
Web site for maximum exposure. These sites also 
carry knitted goods, clothing for adults and children, 
vintage items, photographs and other visual 
artworks, paper goods, spices and other food items; 
services such as custom DVDs of your special event; 
and craft supplies for making your own project. 
Potential buyers can see photographs of individual 
items and ratings of different sellers. They also can 
choose from various payment options.
Now the largest online artisan and vintage market, 
Etsy was founded in Brooklyn, New York, and got a 
boost from the craft boom. But when the collapse of 
the job market drove many hobbyists to try to make 
a living from their crafts, its membership soared. Etsy 
now has 3.75 million registered users and had gross 
sales of $180.6 million in a recent year. A search 
on Etsy turned up 86,237 finger rings on 4,107 
pages, with prices ranging from pennies to almost 
a hundred thousand dollars for an opulent diamond 
engagement ring.
Opening an online shop is cheaper and easier 
than opening a brick-and-mortar equivalent. Most 
Web sites allow sellers to set up shop for free, 
then charge a small fee to post an item and take a 
percentage of each sale. For example, Etsy charges 
20 cents to post one item for four months, then 
takes 3.5 percent when that item is sold. That isn’t 
very much, but if sellers want their items to stay high 
in search results, they have to renew the listings 
often. Some sellers even renew daily, so the fees 
can add up. Etsy also offers sellers a support system 
via blogs and links to social-networking sites such 
as Facebook and Twitter. It is working to improve 
its search functions and is planning to set up a 
customer service phone line.
Many people dream of quitting their day jobs to 
make a living from selling their handmade products 
online, but selling online is not easy and is getting 
harder. Competition has become extreme as more 
artisans are joining these Web sites. Working from 
home or a studio often means spending long hours 
knitting or sewing or making jewelry, especially 
during the holiday rush—then more long hours 
standing in line at the post office, waiting to ship 
the items sold. And of course, sellers have to spend 
time promoting their products in every possible 
medium, from blogs to magazines to, yes, that 
network of friends and associates. With time and 
a great deal of work, some people have made the 
transition and are earning six-figure incomes doing 
what they love.
Janell Mooney sells handmade soap, beaded jewelry, 
gifts, and accessories from her Etsy shop. She writes, 
“I know many sellers on Etsy who started out as 
buyers, and were so inspired by the community and 
their spirit, that they’ve become sellers as well.”1

Part 4  Marketing Management
Overview
11
Business success in the 21st century is 
directly tied to a company’s ability to iden-
tify and serve its target markets. In fact, all 
organizations—profit-oriented and not-for-
profit, manufacturing and retailing—must 
serve customer needs to succeed, just as 
Etsy does by offering an incredible array of 
unique, handmade items. Marketing is the 
link between the organization and the people 
who buy and use its goods and services. It is 
the way organizations determine buyer needs 
and inform potential customers that their 
firms can meet those needs by supplying a 
quality product at a reasonable price. And 
it is the path to developing loyal, long-term 
customers.
Although consumers who purchase 
goods for their own use and enjoyment, or 
business purchasers seeking products to use 
in their firm’s operation, may seem to be 
a large number of undifferentiated masses, 
marketers see distinct wants and needs for 
each group. To understand buyers, from 
manufacturers to Web surfers to shoppers in 
the grocery aisles, companies gather moun-
tains of data on every aspect of consumer 
lifestyles and buying behaviors. Marketers 
use the data to understand the needs and 
wants of both final customers and business 
buyers. Satisfying customers goes a long way 
toward building relationships with them. 
It’s not always easy. To establish links with 
the buying public, Whole Foods CEO John 
Mackey invites e-mails from consumers 
who may—or may not—be customers. After 
several weeks of electronic debate with an 
animal welfare activist over Whole Foods’s 
practice of selling duck meat from a particu-
lar source, Mackey asked the activist to help 
rewrite his firm’s policies on farm animal 
treatment. This relationship, which devel-
oped through direct communication between 
the CEO and a consumer, has helped Whole 
Foods cement its relationship with custom-
ers who have certain food-source concerns.
This chapter begins with an examination 
of the marketing concept and the way busi-
nesspeople develop a marketing strategy. 
We then turn to marketing research tech-
niques, leading to an explanation of how 
businesses apply data to market segmenta-
tion and understanding customer behavior. 
The chapter closes with a detailed look at 
the important role customer relationships 
play in today’s highly competitive business 
world.
What Is Marketing?
Every organization—from profit-seeking firms such as McDonald’s and Drugstore.com 
to such not-for-profits as the Make-a-Wish Foundation and the American Cancer Society—
must serve customer needs to succeed. Perhaps retail pioneer J. C. Penney best expressed 
this priority when he told his store managers, “Either you or your replacement will greet the 
customer within the first 60 seconds.”

Chapter 11  Customer-Driven Marketing
353
According to the American 
Marketing Association, marketing is 
“an organizational function and a set of 
processes for creating, communicating, 
and delivering value to customers and 
for managing customer relationships in 
ways that benefit the organization and 
its stakeholders.”2 In addition to selling 
goods and services, marketing techniques 
help people advocate ideas or viewpoints 
and educate others. The American 
Diabetes Association mails out ques-
tionnaires that ask, “Are you at risk for 
diabetes?” The documents help educate 
the general public about this widespread 
disease by listing its risk factors and com-
mon symptoms and describing the work 
of the association.
Department store founder Marshall 
Field explained marketing quite clearly 
when he advised one employee to “give 
the lady what she wants.” The phrase 
became the company motto, and it remains a business truism today. The best marketers 
not only give consumers what they want but even anticipate consumers’ needs before those 
needs surface. Ideally, they can get a jump on the competition by creating a link in consum-
ers’ minds between the new need and the fulfillment of that need by the marketers’ products. 
Principal Financial Group, with headquarters in Iowa, markets employee retirement plans to 
other firms that then custom tailor those plans to retain key employees. NetJets offers frac-
tional jet ownership to executives who want the luxury and flexibility of private ownership 
without the cost of owning their own plane. Samsung offers its next generation of high-
definition TV with its trademarked Internet@TV. Owners can connect their televisions to 
their home Internet connection, then add widgets to track the weather, check eBay, view 
Flickr albums, and check for Twitter updates—all in real time. In addition, they can get 
Video-on-Demand service through Blockbuster and Amazon. “Get the best of the Web 
right on your TV!” their promotion says.
As these examples illustrate, marketing is more than just selling. It is a process that 
begins with discovering unmet customer needs and continues with researching the poten-
tial market; producing a good or service capable of satisfying the targeted customers; and 
promoting, pricing, and distributing that good or service. Throughout the entire marketing 
process, a successful organization focuses on building customer relationships.
When two or more parties benefit from trading things of value, they have entered into 
an exchange process. When you purchase a cup of coffee, the other party may be a con-
venience store clerk, a vending machine, or a Dunkin’ Donuts server. The exchange seems 
simple—some money changes hands, and you receive your cup of coffee. But the exchange 
process is more complex than that. It could not occur if you didn’t feel the need for a cup 
of coffee or if the convenience store or vending machine were not available. You wouldn’t 
choose Dunkin’ Donuts unless you were aware of the brand. Because of marketing, your 
desire for a flavored blend, decaf, or plain black coffee is identified, and the coffee manufac-
turer’s business is successful.

PepsiCo recently launched the Pepsi Refresh Project, a year-long 
initiative in which consumers were invited to submit short videos of 
ideas that would benefit their communities. Pepsi accepted 1,000 
videos each month and posted them online so that visitors to the Web 
site could vote on them. At the end of each month, Pepsi awarded 
grants of varying amounts to the winning projects, with the company 
giving away a total of $20 million over the year. Instead of advertising 
the project in a costly slot during the Super Bowl, Pepsi announced 
that it would not be doing so and instead posted a video on the Web. 
The video quickly went viral (spreading quickly through the process 
of Internet sharing), with visits to the Refresh Web site soaring an 
astonishing 800 percent after the Super Bowl in February and staying 
consistent.
Facebook and Twitter have revolutionized Internet marketing. 
Facebook has roughly 300 million members worldwide. Twitter claims 
to log 50 million tweets per day. According to Pepsi’s CEO, Indra 
Nooyi, the company is investing one-third of its marketing budget in 
social media.
Marketing the project on the Web had advantages and disad-
vantages. Traffic to the Web site seemed to drop during the first three 
weeks of each month, then spike during the last week in the final 
round of voting, so announcing winners every month was an advan-
tage. Also, people hoping to win grants set up their own local social 
media campaigns using Facebook and Twitter, thus generating more 
publicity for the project. However, as time went on, these contestants 
and some celebrity contestants became the sources of most of 
the publicity.
SEO (search-engine optimization) firms watched the campaign 
closely to monitor its successes and to spot features that could be 
improved for future campaigns.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Choose an advertiser with a presence on Facebook and 
Twitter. Which social medium seems more successful at 
getting the advertiser’s message across?
2. If you have a Facebook page, how would you use it to 
market either your own business or a cause that inspires 
you?

How Marketing Creates Utility
Marketing affects many aspects of an organization and its dealings with customers. The 
ability of a good or service to satisfy the wants and needs of customers is called utility. A 
company’s production function creates form utility by converting raw materials, component 
parts, and other inputs into finished goods and services. But the marketing function creates 
time, place, and ownership utility. Time utility is created by making a good or service avail-
able when customers want to purchase it. Place utility is created by making a product avail-
able in a location convenient for customers. Ownership utility refers to an orderly transfer of 
goods and services from the seller to the buyer. Firms may be able to create all three forms 
of utility. Target is the first nationwide retailer to offer bar-coded, scannable mobile coupons 
direct to cell phones. Guests can sign on to the program either on their personal comput-
ers or on their cell phones. Each month, they receive a text message with a link to a mobile 
Web site page where they will find offers for various products. They can use the mobile 
coupons at any Target store nationwide because Target is the first retailer to have point-of-
sale scanning technology for the coupons in all of its stores. Steve Eastman, the president of 
Target.com, says, “At Target, we know that mobile phones are an integral part of our guests’ 
lives, and mobile coupons are just another way we’re providing convenient, on-the-go shop-
ping solutions.”3 The soft-drink giant PepsiCo has also created several forms of utility for its 
customers through social networking media, as described in the “Hit & Miss” feature.

Evolution of the Marketing Concept
Marketing has always been a part of business, from the earliest village traders to large 
21st-century organizations producing and selling complex goods and services. Over time, 
however, marketing activities evolved through the four eras shown in Figure 11.1: the pro-
duction, sales, and marketing eras, and now the relationship era. Note that these eras parallel 
some of the time periods discussed in Chapter 1.
For centuries, organizations of the production era stressed efficiency in producing quality 
products. Their philosophy could be summed up by the remark, “A good product will sell 
itself.” Although this production orientation continued into the 20th century, it gradually 
gave way to the sales era, in which businesses assumed that consumers would buy as a result 
of energetic sales efforts. Organizations didn’t fully recognize the importance of their cus-
tomers until the marketing era of the 1950s, when they began to adopt a consumer orienta-
tion. This focus has intensified in recent years, leading to the emergence of the relationship 
era in the 1990s, which continues to this day. In the relationship era, companies emphasize 
customer satisfaction and building long-term business relationships.
Emergence of the Marketing Concept
The term marketing concept refers to a companywide customer orientation with the 
objective of achieving long-run success. The basic idea of the marketing concept is that 
marketplace success begins with the customer. A firm should analyze each customer’s needs 
and then work backward to offer products that fulfill them. The emergence of the marketing 
concept can be explained best by the shift from a seller’s market, one with a shortage of goods 
and services, to a buyer’s market, one with an abundance of goods and services. During the

1950s, the United States became a strong buyer’s market, forcing companies to satisfy cus-
tomers rather than just producing and selling goods and services.
Today, much competition among firms centers on the effort to satisfy customers. 
Apple’s iPhone followed on the heels of its wildly successful iPod, with the combined fea-
tures of a cell phone, widescreen iPod with touch controls, and Internet link. Like its prede-
cessors, the 3G iPhone operates completely by touch screen, has a 3.5-inch display, contains 
a full Safari Web browser, and even takes pictures with a 3-megapixel camera. The more 
recent iPod Touch borrowed some of the iPhone’s revolutionary features, and Apple then 
introduced the iPad, a touchscreen tablet computer and reader with WiFi or WiFi plus 3G. 
Some observers wonder whether the iPad will be as big a success as the iPod or the iPhone, 
but Apple is well known for anticipating and responding quickly to consumers’ needs. “Apple 
clearly wants potential buyers to think of the iPad as a casual entertainment device,” says one 
industry watcher.4
Not-for-Proﬁ t and Nontraditional 
Marketing
The marketing concept has traditionally been associated with products of profit-seeking 
organizations. Today, however, it is also being applied to not-for-profit sectors and other 
nontraditional areas ranging from religious organizations to political campaigns.
Not-for-Profit Marketing
Residents of every continent benefit in various ways from the approximately 20 mil-
lion not-for-profit organizations currently operating around the globe. Some 1.9 million 
of them are located in the United States, where they employ some 12.9 million workers 
and benefit from volunteers representing the equivalent of 9 million full-time employees.5 
By counting the value of those equivalent volunteers, Canada leads the world in contribu-
tions to its gross domestic product by not-for-profit organizations, with the United States 
a close second.6 The largest not-for-profit organization in the world is the Red Cross/
Red Crescent. Other not-for-profits range from Habitat for Humanity to the Boys & Girls 
Clubs of America to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. These organizations all benefit 
by applying many of the strategies and business concepts used by profit-seeking firms. They 
apply marketing tools to reach audiences, secure funding, and accomplish their overall mis-
sions. Marketing strategies are important for not-for-profit organizations because they are 
all competing for dollars—from individuals, foundations, and corporations—just as com-
mercial businesses are.
Not-for-profit organizations operate in both public and private sectors. Public groups 
include federal, state, and local government units as well as agencies that receive tax fund-
ing. A state’s department of natural resources, for instance, regulates land conservation and 
environmental programs; the local animal control officer enforces ordinances protecting 
people and animals; a city’s public health board ensures safe drinking water for its citizens. 
The private not-for-profit sector comprises many different types of organizations, includ-
ing the Houston Zoo, the United States Olympic Committee, and the American Academy 
of Pediatrics. Although some private not-for-profits generate surplus revenue, their primary

goals are not earning profits. If they earn funds beyond their expenses, they invest the excess 
in their organizational missions.
In some cases, not-for-profit organizations form a partnership with a profit-seeking 
company to promote the firm’s message or distribute its goods and services. This partner-
ship usually benefits both organizations. The National Football League and the United Way 
joined to form one of the longest-running public-service partnerships in the United States. 
NFL athletes and other personalities appear in public-service advertisements and in person 
to promote community service and fundraising. Since 1999, the “Hometown Huddle” has 
been an NFL-wide day of service when team members, their families, coaches, and staff 
members participate in local community service activities.7
Celebrities are particularly visible campaigning for not-for-profit organizations—their 
own as well as others. The actress Reese Witherspoon is the Avon Global Ambassador and 
Honorary Chairperson of the Avon Foundation for Women. Witherspoon helped present 
a $500,000 grant to the Fund for Global Women’s Leadership. The grant was intended to 
help the worldwide movement to end violence toward women.8
Nontraditional Marketing
Not-for-profit organizations often engage in one or more of five major categories of 
nontraditional marketing: person marketing, place marketing, event marketing, cause mar-
keting, and organization marketing. Figure 11.2 provides examples of these types of market-
ing. As described in the “Going Green” feature, through each of these types of marketing,

Part 4  Marketing Management
The Tap Project
Recently, Esquire magazine challenged David Droga, the founder 
of the Droga5 advertising firm, to prove that his creative thinking 
deserved the magazine’s “Best and Brightest” award. After seeing a 
documentary about New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, Droga started 
thinking about how many people don’t have access to clean, safe 
drinking water—which most Americans take for granted. When he was 
served the typical free glass of tap water at a New York City restaurant, 
he got the inspiration for his next advertising campaign. Droga remem-
bers thinking, “We have to make people aware of the luxury we have 
and help others who don’t have it.” He presented his idea to UNICEF, 
and the Tap Project was born.
Approximately 900 million people around the world—about half 
of them children—lack safe, accessible drinking water. UNICEF and the 
Tap Project hope to cut that number in half by 2015. Every day, 4,100 
children under age 5 die of water-borne diseases.
During the UN’s World Water Week, top restaurants in New York 
City asked their patrons to donate one dollar or more for a glass of 
tap water. Since then, the Tap Project has raised almost $1.5 million in 
the United States. All donations go to UNICEF’s water, sanitation, and 
hygiene programs. One dollar allows UNICEF to provide safe drinking 
water to one child for 40 days. Funds raised in 2010 went primarily 
to Haiti, the Central African Republic, Guatemala, Togo, and Vietnam. 
Caryl Stein, the president and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, noted, 
“In Haiti alone, less than 60 percent of people had access to safe water 
even before the earthquake.”
Leading advertising agencies in the United States have participated 
in the Tap Project. Casanova Pendrill Publicidad, which aims at the 
Hispanic market, won the top prize in Advertising Age’s Non-Traditional/
Guerrilla Marketing category. In its “Agua Sucia” (“dirty water”) cam-
paign, the firm bottled dirty water as if it were mineral water and sold 
the bottles for $1 from vending machines on New York City streets. 
“Customers” could choose from such “flavors” as cholera, typhoid, 
hepatitis, and dysentery. The agency’s slogan was, “You’d never drink 
dirty water, the rest of the world shouldn’t have to, either.”
In succeeding years, the Tap Project spread to other U.S. cities 
and advertising agencies. In a recent year, 21 agencies produced 
advertisements that ran in 19 cities, in addition to efforts nationwide 
and on the Internet. For the most recent World Water Week, the Tap 
Project changed its focus. More than 1,000 restaurants participated, 
but volunteers also hosted 250 other fund-raising events around the 
country. The campaign established a presence on Facebook and Twitter 
as well as an online radio station. However, only five cities—Chicago, 
Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, and Washington, DC–and eight adver-
tising agencies were involved. Ryu Mizuno, the director of marketing 
at the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, said the Tap Project was “maturing as a 
brand” and that the fund preferred “doing a few things in a great way 
instead of being all over the map.”
Some observers claim that such changes are typical of nontradi-
tional marketing campaigns, especially those where ad agencies have 
volunteered their services. Another difference from the first years is that 
the Tap Project’s very success has spawned other water charities, all 
vying for donations and volunteers. The earthquake in Haiti also had 
an impact. However, UNICEF planned to grow the campaign again in 
2011. Mr. Mizuno said, “Agencies that participated in the past and 
didn’t participate this year are staying in touch with us.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What types of nontraditional marketing does the Tap 
Project engage in?
2. As this feature mentions, fewer cities and advertisers par-
ticipated in World Water Week. What steps would you 
suggest to improve participation in future years?

an organization seeks to connect with the audience that is most likely to offer time, money, 
or other resources. In some cases, the effort may reach the market the organization intends 
to serve.
Person Marketing Efforts designed to attract the attention, interest, and prefer-
ence of a target market toward a person are called person marketing. Campaign managers 
for a political candidate conduct marketing research; identify groups of voters and financial 
supporters; and then design advertising campaigns, fund-raising events, and political rallies 
to reach them. In another example of person marketing, T-Mobile brought back its former

American Idol season finale.9
Many successful job seekers apply the tools of 
person marketing. They research the wants and 
needs of prospective employers, and they identify 
ways they can meet them. They seek employers 
through a variety of channels, sending messages that 
emphasize how they can benefit the employer.
Place Marketing As the term suggests, 
place marketing attempts to attract people to a 
particular area, such as a city, state, or nation. It 
may involve appealing to consumers as a tourist des-
tination or to businesses as a desirable business loca-
tion. A strategy for place marketing often includes 
advertising.
Place marketing may be combined with 
event marketing, such as the Olympics. The city 
of Vancouver used three mythical cartoon crit-
ters, named Quatchi, Miga, and Sumi, to promote 
the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. 
Merchandise featuring the mascots was available for 
sale to the public more than two years before the 
actual games took place.10
Event Marketing Marketing or sponsoring short-term events such as athletic 
competitions and cultural and charitable performances is known as event marketing. 
Target recently sponsored the first women’s junior professional surfing competition. The 
American Diabetes Association sponsored the “Tour de Cure,” a series of fund-raising 
cycling events held across the United States to raise funds to support its mission to prevent 
and cure diabetes.11
Event marketing often forges partnerships between not-for-profit and profit-seeking 
organizations. Many businesses sponsor events such as 10K runs to raise funds for health-
related charities. These occasions require a marketing effort to plan the event and attract 
participants and sponsors. Events may be intended to raise money or awareness, or both.
Cause Marketing Marketing that promotes awareness of, or raises money 
for, a cause or social issue, such as drug abuse prevention or childhood hunger is cause 
marketing. Cause marketing seeks to educate the public and may or may not attempt to 
directly raise funds. An advertisement often contains a phone number or Web site address 
through which people can obtain more information about the organization or issue. Then 
they can either donate money or take other actions of support. The international accounting 
firm Deloitte sponsors the United Way’s Alternative Spring Break program. Instead of head-
ing for the beach, young adults and student volunteers participated in community activities 
such as the continuing rebuilding of communities devastated by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, 
and Ike, or conducting their own local programs.12

Part 4  Marketing Management
Profit-seeking companies look for ways to contribute to their 
communities by joining forces with charities and causes, provid-
ing financial, marketing, and human resources. Timberland is 
well known for participating in the City Year program, through 
which young adults contract to perform a year of volunteer ser-
vice in their communities. For-profit firms can also combine 
their goods and services with a cause. Seventh Generation, which 
makes household cleaning and paper products, is committed to 
educating consumers about how “green” products can make their 
homes healthier and safer.13
Organization Marketing The final category of 
nontraditional marketing, organization marketing, influences 
consumers to accept the goals of, receive the services of, or con-
tribute in some way to an organization. The U.S. Postal Service, 
the American Cancer Society, and Oprah Winfrey’s Angel 
Network are all examples of organizations that engage in mar-
keting. They use their own Web sites, advertise in magazines, 
and send mail directly to consumers in their efforts to market 
their organizations. The Angel Network was established by 
Oprah Winfrey more than a decade ago in an order to “encour-
age people around the world to make a difference in the lives of 
others.” The organization initiates its own charitable projects as 
well as supporting the projects of other not-for-profits such as 
Habitat for Humanity and The Boys & Girls Clubs of America.14
Developing a Marketing 
Strategy
Decision makers in any successful organization, for-profit or not-for-profit, follow a 
two-step process to develop a marketing strategy. First, they study and analyze potential tar-
get markets and choose among them. Second, they create a marketing mix to satisfy the cho-
sen market. Figure 11.3 shows the relationships among the target market, the marketing mix 
variables, and the marketing environment. Later discussions refer back to this figure as they 
cover each topic. This section describes the development of a marketing strategy designed to 
attract and build relationships with customers. Sometimes, in an effort to do this, marketers 
use questionable methods, as described in the “Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature.
Earlier chapters of this book introduced many of the environmental factors that affect 
the success or failure of a firm’s business strategy, including today’s rapidly changing and 
highly competitive world of business, a vast array of social and cultural factors, economic 
challenges, political and legal factors, and technological innovations. Although these external 
forces frequently operate outside managers’ control, marketers must still consider the impact 
of environmental factors on their decisions.
A marketing plan is a key component of a firm’s overall business plan. The marketing 
plan outlines its marketing strategy and includes information about the target market, sales 
and revenue goals, the marketing budget, and the timing for implementing the elements of 
the marketing mix.

When times are tough and credit is tight, consumers are more 
likely to search for and monitor their credit scores. The Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA) requires the three major consumer reporting 
companies—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—to provide consumers 
a free copy of their credit report once a year. Consumers must request 
the report through the official Annual Credit Report Request Service 
by phone or mail, or online at AnnualCreditReport.com. Credit report 
companies claim to offer free credit reports—but many offers contain 
hidden charges. Also, Experian has profited because consumers con-
fuse its FreeCreditReport.com division with the federal government’s 
AnnualCreditReport.com, the only truly free Web site.
Should fi rms be allowed to use the word “free” in 
advertising for credit reports if the service contains 
hidden charges?
Summary
The Federal Trade Commission’s Free Credit Reports Rule requires credit report Web sites to carry the 
following across the top of each page: “THIS NOTICE IS REQUIRED BY LAW. Read more at FTC.GOV. You 
have the right to a free credit report from AnnualCreditReport.com or 877-322-8228, the ONLY authorized 
source under federal law.” Very recently, rather than including this disclosure, Experian began charging $1 
for a credit report and donating the fee to charity.

PRO
1. If the credit score itself is free, but related services are not, 
then the advertising is truthful. Ty Taylor, the president of Experian’s 
Consumer Direct Division, says, “You get a free credit report and free 
score for test-driving our services.”
2. Some promotional offers contain free credit scores, with a tie-in 
to additional services for a fee. Other industries make similar offers for 
a free month of phone, cable, or Internet service.
CON
1. The word “free” is a powerful enticement in advertising. Some 
companies provide “free” reports, then bill consumers for services they 
have to cancel.
2. Consumer advocates say firms exploit people’s fears. Edgar 
Dworsky, the founder of ConsumerWorld.org and formerly on 
Experian’s consumer advisory panel, says, “Does the average per-
son really need to see their credit reports more than once every four 
months? Do you need to look at it daily? That’s paranoia.”
When Free Credit Reports Aren’t Free
Selecting a Target Market
The expression “find a need and fill it” is perhaps the simplest explanation of the two 
elements of a marketing strategy. A firm’s marketers find a need through careful and 
continuing study of the individuals and business decision makers in its potential market. 
A market consists of people with purchasing power, willingness to buy, and authority to 
make purchase decisions.
Markets can be classified by type of product. Consumer products—often known as busi-
ness-to-consumer (B2C) products—are goods and services, such as GPS systems, tomato sauce,

(B2B) products—are goods and services purchased to be used, either directly or indirectly, in the 
production of other goods for resale. Some products can fit either classification depending on 
who buys them and why. A computer or credit card can be used by a business or a consumer.

Bon Appétit is aimed at readers who are inter-
ested in fine food and cooking.
Decisions about marketing involve 
strategies for four areas of marketing activ-
ity: product, distribution, promotion, and 
pricing. A firm’s marketing mix blends the 
four strategies to fit the needs and prefer-
ences of a specific target market. Marketing 
success depends not on the four individual 
strategies but on their unique combination.
Product strategy involves more than just 
designing a good or service with needed 
attributes. It also includes decisions about 
package design, brand names, trademarks, 
warranties, product image, new-product 
development, and customer service. Think 
about your favorite pair of jeans. Do you 
like them because they fit the best, or do 
other attributes—such as styling and over-
all image—also contribute to your brand 
preference? Distribution strategy, the second 
marketing mix variable, ensures that custom-
ers receive their purchases in the proper 
quantities at the right times and locations. 
Promotional strategy, another marketing mix 
element, effectively blends advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, and public relations to 
achieve its goals of informing, persuading, and influencing purchase decisions.
Pricing strategy, the final mix element, is also one of the most difficult areas of mar-
keting decision making in setting profitable and justifiable prices for the firm’s product 
offerings. Such actions are sometimes subject to government regulation and considerable 
public scrutiny. They also represent a powerful competitive weapon and frequently produce 
responses by the other firms in the industry, who match price changes to avoid losing cus-
tomers. Think about your jeans again. Would you continue to purchase them if they were 
priced either much higher or much lower?
Retail clinics are low-cost, walk-in medical facilities usually found in supermarkets, chain 
drugstores, and big-box stores. Patients typically see nurse practitioners or physician assis-
tants, who can diagnose and treat minor medical conditions and prescribe some medications. 
The clinics are open late in the evenings and on weekends and also offer appropriate vac-
cinations and inexpensive sports and summer-camp physicals for children. They proved to be 
a popular alternative to primary care in areas where primary care physicians are scarce and 
because of their low cost, usually from $55 to $65 per visit. Retail clinics increased dramati-
cally from just 200 to about 1,200 over the past few years. But after that, growth stalled, and 
both CVS and Walgreens closed some clinics. Some problems are the seasonality of such 
offerings as flu shots and the summer-camp physicals, oversaturation of the market in some 
areas, and difficulty in reaching potential patients who don’t shop at the particular parent 
store. Retail clinics are evolving with the changing economic landscape, and how the opera-
tors of the clinics will solve these marketing problems remains to be seen.15

Developing a Marketing Mix for International Markets
Marketing a good or service in foreign markets means deciding whether to offer the 
same marketing mix in every market (standardization) or to develop a unique mix to fit each 
market (adaptation). The advantages of standardizing the marketing mix include reliable mar-
keting performance and low costs. This approach works best with B2B goods, such as steel, 
chemicals, and aircraft, which require little sensitivity to a nation’s culture.
Adaptation, on the other hand, lets marketers vary their marketing mix to suit local 
competitive conditions, consumer preferences, and government regulations. Consumer 
tastes are often shaped by local cultures. Because consumer products generally tend to be 
more culture dependent than business products, they more often require adaptation. Subway, 
which already has 144 stores in China, plans to open 500 new stores in the next five years 
and hopes to match the Chinese presence of McDonald’s in 10 years. As Subway opens 
stores in different regions, it plans to adapt its menu to local tastes with such offerings as 
Beijing roast duck sandwiches and “hot spicy Szechuan sauce.” Why do these firms go out 
of their way to adapt to Chinese preferences? China is a market with 1.3 billion potential 
consumers.16
Marketers also try to build adaptability into the designs of standardized goods and ser-
vices for international and domestic markets. Mass customization allows a firm to mass pro-
duce goods and services while adding unique features to individual or small groups of orders. 
For example, online firm Blank Label specializes in custom men’s dress shirts and allows 
customers to choose their own fabric, style, individual features, and size. Spreadshirt, with 
U.S. headquarters in Boston, specializes in customized casual wear, accessories, and even 
personalized underwear.17

Part 4  Marketing Management
Marketing Research
Marketing research involves more than just collecting data. Researchers must decide 
how to collect data, interpret the results, convert the data into decision-oriented informa-
tion, and communicate those results to managers for use in decision making. Marketing 
research is the process of collecting and evaluating information to help marketers make 
effective decisions. It links business decision makers to the marketplace by providing data 
about potential target markets that help them design effective marketing mixes.
Obtaining Marketing Research Data
Marketing researchers need both internal and external data. Firms generate internal 
data within their organizations. Financial records provide a tremendous amount of useful 
information, such as changes in unpaid bills; inventory levels; sales generated by different 
categories of customers or product lines; profitability of particular divisions; or comparisons 
of sales by territories, salespeople, customers, or product lines.
Researchers gather external data from outside sources, including previously published 
data. Trade associations publish reports on activities in particular industries. Advertising 
agencies collect information on the audiences reached by various media. National marketing 
research firms offer information through subscription services. Some of these professional 
research firms specialize in specific markets, such as teens or ethnic groups. This information 
helps companies make decisions about developing or modifying products. A recent report by 
the marketing research firm comScore on smart phone purchases indicates that Research in 
Motion’s BlackBerry was still the best seller, with 43 percent of the market. Apple’s iPhone 
was second, with 25 percent. In a surprising development, Palm’s Pre, formerly in third 
place, was overtaken by Google’s Android-based devices. Microsoft devices also showed a 
decline. Such data can give indirect but very clear indications of what consumers are looking 
for in a product.18
The largest consumer-goods manufacturer in the world, Procter & Gamble, has excelled 
in marketing research for a long time; it created its own marketing research department in 
1923 and began conducting its research online in 2001. To help the company recover from 
the global recession, Bob McDonald, the company’s chief executive officer, has set the goal 
of reaching 1 billion new customers by 2015. This expansion involves reaching customers in 
developing regions. As part of this strategy, he traveled undercover to 30 countries, posing as 
a marketing researcher.19
Secondary data, or previously published data, are low cost and easy to obtain. Federal, 
state, and local government publications are excellent data sources, and most are available 
online. The most frequently used government statistics include census data, which contain 
the population’s age, gender, education level, household size and composition, occupa-
tion, employment status, and income. Even private research firms such as TRU (formerly 
Teenage Research Unlimited), which studies the purchasing habits of teens, provide some 
free information on their Web sites. This information helps firms evaluate consumers’ buy-
ing behavior, anticipate possible changes in the marketplace, and identify new markets.
Even though secondary data are a quick and inexpensive resource, marketing research-
ers sometimes discover that this information isn’t specific or current enough for their needs. 
If so, researchers may conclude that they must collect primary data—data collected firsthand 
through such methods as observation and surveys.

Observational studies view the actions of consumers either directly or through mechani-
cal devices. As more retailers watch their customers via video cameras, they can solve prob-
lems such as widening a too-narrow aisle to allow shoppers easier access, but such close 
monitoring has also raised privacy concerns.20 Procter & Gamble spends about $200 million 
on consumer observation each year, citing it as the firm’s most important type of marketing 
research. CEO McDonald says, “If we can continue to innovate and continue to mind con-
sumer needs and delight consumers, that ability outweighs any macroeconomic force.”21
Simply observing customers cannot provide some types of information. A researcher 
might observe a customer buying a red sweater, but have no idea why the purchase was 
made—or for whom. When researchers need information about consumers’ attitudes, opin-
ions, and motives, they need to ask the consumers themselves. They may conduct surveys by 
telephone, in person, online, or in focus groups.
A focus group gathers 8 to 12 people in a room or over the Internet to discuss a particu-
lar topic. A focus group can generate new ideas, address consumers’ needs, and even point 
out flaws in existing products. Pottery Barn Kids, a division of Pottery Barn, developed its 
Learning Toys Collection through observation, reading, and focus groups. Focus groups 
that included both parents and children were gathered and observed as they played with and 
talked about the new toys. Marketing researchers have also begun to take advantage of social 
media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, and blogs as well as mobile marketing.22
Applying Marketing Research Data
As the accuracy of information collected by researchers increases, so does the effectiveness 
of resulting marketing strategies. One field of research is known as business intelligence, 
which uses various activities and technologies to gather, store, and analyze data to make better 
competitive decisions. Dell established its IdeaStorm Web site to gather information, criti-
cism, compliments, and ideas for developing new computer products and improving existing 
ones. New users must register at the site and follow guidelines in order to post their ideas and 
reactions. Submitted ideas receive scores for their popularity, which helps Dell sort through 
material and decide which ideas to pursue. Recently, Dell added “Storm Sessions,” where the 
company posts a topic and asks visitors to contribute their ideas. To make the discussions 
specific and relevant to the topic, each session is open only for a limited time. “Our commit-
ment is to listen to your input and ideas to improve our products and services, and the way we 
do business,” reads a welcoming note to the site. “We will do our best to keep you posted on 
how Dell brings customer ideas to life.”23
Data Mining
Once a company has built a database, marketers must be able to analyze the data and use 
the information it provides. Data mining, part of the broader field of business intelligence, 
is the task of using computer-based technology to evaluate data in a database and identify 
useful trends. These trends or patterns may suggest predictive models of real-world business 
activities. Accurate data mining can help researchers forecast recessions and pinpoint 
sales prospects.
Data mining uses data warehouses, which are sophisticated customer databases that 
allow managers to combine data from several different organizational functions. Companies 
such as San Franciso’s Rapleaf Inc. collect publicly available personal information from 
social-networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and other forums. They then sell this

information to entities such as airlines and credit card companies that regard those individu-
als as potential customers. Such information can include everything from your blogging or 
posting habits to your credit rating. Among the issues arising from data mining are owner-
ship of Web user data, the targeting capabilities of the Web, government supervision—and, 
of course, privacy.
A few days after Google launched its social network Google Buzz, it had to make some 
changes to protect users’ privacy. More reprogramming may be needed, pending a petition 
to the Federal Trade Commission and a class-action lawsuit. However, Google Buzz does 
give users the choice of whether to state publicly who is following them and whom they 
are following. Some observers feel that privacy norms are changing, with confidentiality 
giving way to increasing openness.24 Turiya Media’s product Leafnode mines and analyzes 
the behavior of online game players by tracking the number of hours they spend on which 
games, then creating behavioral profiles. Game publishers pay a monthly fee for the result-
ing data, which enable them to “proactively identify and retain their best customers, and tar-
get them with personalized recommendations.”25
Market Segmentation
Market segmentation is the process of dividing a market into several relatively homo-
geneous groups. Both profit-seeking and not-for-profit organizations use segmentation to 
help them reach desirable target markets. Market segmentation is often based on the results 
of research, which attempts to identify trends among certain groups of people. For instance, 
one survey of online teens revealed that the number of online teenagers and young adults 
who blog dropped from 28 percent in one recent year to 14 or 15 percent just a few years 
later. Social networking seems to have taken over communications functions among these 
two groups, with use growing to 73 percent and 72 percent, respectively. Only 8 percent 
of teenagers polled use Twitter.26 This kind of information can help marketers decide what 
types of products to develop and to whom they should be marketed.
Market segmentation attempts to isolate the traits that distinguish a certain group of 
customers from the overall market. However, segmentation doesn’t automatically produce 
marketing success. Table 11.1 lists several criteria that marketers should consider. The effec-
tiveness of a segmentation strategy depends on how well the market meets these criteria. 
Once marketers identify a market segment to target, they can create an appropriate market-
ing strategy.

Knowing that the holiday season can make or break their entire business year, retail-
ers need to predict accurately—months ahead of time—trends and customer spending pat-
terns, especially during or after difficult economic times. The toy retailing giant Toys “R” 
Us identified a hot toy trend among children during one recent holiday season, so the firm 
kicked into high gear to stock the toy. Zhu Zhu Pets, plush mechanical hamsters, did indeed 
prove to be a huge hit, with parents camped out in parking lots, waiting to buy them. Gerald 
Storch, the company’s CEO, said, “history has shown that the future rewards companies 
which are aggressive during economic downturns.”27
How Market Segmentation Works
An immediate segmentation distinction involves whether the firm is offering goods 
and services to customers for their own use or to purchasers who will use them directly or 
indirectly in providing other products for resale (the so-called B2B market). Depending 
on whether their firms offer consumer or business products, marketers segment their 
target markets differently. Four common bases for segmenting consumer markets are 
geographical segmentation, demographic segmentation, psychographic segmentation, and 
product-related segmentation. By contrast, business markets can segment on three crite-
ria: customer-based segmentation, end-use segmentation, and geographical segmentation. 
Figure 11.4 illustrates the segmentation methods for these two types of markets.
Segmenting Consumer Markets
Market segmentation has been practiced since people first began selling products.

India for tea drinkers in England and other European countries. In addition to demographic

and geographical segmentation, today’s marketers also define customer groups based on psy-
chographic—lifestyle and values—criteria as well as product-related distinctions.
Geographical Segmentation The oldest segmentation method is 
geographical segmentation—dividing a market into homogeneous groups on the 
basis of their locations. Geographical location does not guarantee that consumers in a certain 
region will all buy the same kinds of products, but it does provide some indication of needs. 
For instance, suburbanites buy more lawn-care products than central-city dwellers. However, 
many suburbanites choose instead to purchase the services of a lawn maintenance firm. 
Consumers who live in northern states, where winter is more severe, are more likely to buy 
ice scrapers, snow shovels, and snowblowers than those who live in warmer climates. They 
are also more likely to contract with firms who remove the snow from driveways. Marketers 
also look at the size of the population of an area, as well as who lives there—are residents old 
or young? Do they reflect an ethnic background? What is the level of their income?
Job growth and migration patterns are important considerations as well. Some busi-
nesses combine areas or even entire countries that share similar population and product-use 
patterns instead of treating each as an independent segment.
Demographic Segmentation By far the most common method of market 
segmentation, demographic segmentation distinguishes markets on the basis of various 
demographic or socioeconomic characteristics. Common demographic measures include 
gender, income, age, occupation, household size, stage in the family life cycle, education, and 
racial or ethnic group. The U.S. Census Bureau is one of the best sources of demographic 
information for the domestic market. Figure 11.5 lists some of the measures used in demo-
graphic segmentation.

Police departments around the United States constitute a highly specialized occupational 
demographic group. Popular for its durability, the Ford Crown Victoria has long held 75 
percent of the patrol-car market share. Ford plans to phase out the “Crown Vic,” replacing 
it with the Police Interceptor, modeled on the Taurus sedan but modified for the extreme 
circumstances of police work. The Interceptor’s fuel efficiency is 25 percent better than 
the Crown Vic’s. Its 365-horsepower engine outguns the Crown Vic’s by 115 horsepower. 
Ford’s police advisory board helped develop the Interceptor, but it may face competition 
from General Motors, Chrysler, and Carbon Motors (based in Indiana), which produce or 
are planning police vehicles of their own.28
Gender used to be a simple way to define markets for certain products—jewelry and skin 
care products for women; tools and motorcycles for men. Much of that has changed—dra-
matically. Men now buy jewelry and skin care products, and women buy tools and motor-
cycles. But marketers have also found that even though these shifts have blurred the lines 
between products, there are still differences in the way that women and men shop. These dif-
ferences may go as far back as humanity’s earliest days, when males generally hunted for food 
and females generally gathered it. One study revealed that many male shoppers behave simi-
larly to early hunters, who once they found a prey animal, tracked it, killed it, and brought it 
back home as fast as possible. Many female shoppers behave more like early gatherers, who 
spent time carefully inspecting a variety of plants, choosing only those that were ripe.29
Another shift involves purchasing power. Women now control an estimated 85 percent 
of the $7 trillion spent each year on personal consumption items.30 One study predicts that 
women will soon control 60 percent of all wealth in the United States, in part because they 
live longer than men.31
Age is perhaps the most volatile factor in demographic segmentation in the United 
States, with our rapidly aging population. Of the 308-plus million people who live in the 
United States, more than 97 million will be age 55 or older by the year 2020.32 Based on 
these statistics, marketers for travel and leisure products, as well as retirement and business 
investments, are working hard to attract the attention of this age group, the aging Baby 
Boomers—those born between 1946 and 1964. Active-adult housing communities are one

Disney marketing aimed at young girls—the “Princesses” prod-
ucts, the Jonas Brothers, High School Musical—has been highly successful, 
although the Disney Channel audience is 40 percent male. (Pirates of the 
Caribbean and Toy Story have sequels in the works.)
In the United States alone, 30 million males are from 5 to 19 
years old. Worldwide, boys (or their parents) spend $50 billion every 
year on clothes, toys, and videogames.
Recently, Disney bought Marvel Entertainment, hoping that 
Marvel’s superheroes would bolster Disney’s XD TV channel. Aimed 
at boys but not excluding girls, the channel offers animation, action-
adventure, comedy, movies, sports-themed shows, and music videos. 
The Disney XD Web site has games, videos, and TV episodes.
How did Disney research a demographic that is known to be 
reluctant to talk about feelings? It hired a team of social scientists, 
who learned the following:
• Boys identify with protagonists who are trying to grow and want 
to see more characters like themselves in TV shows.
• Boys personalize their skateboards on the underside and carry 
them so the tag shows.
• Boys like to share small accomplishments.
• Boys shuttle quickly from one activity to another, moving among 
TV, videogames, sports, and so on.
• Boys want more variety and authenticity in TV shows aimed at 
them, not merely all action or all cartoons.
Disney implemented these results, for instance, by adding a 
trophy room to the games page at the XD Web site and by advising its 
actors to carry their skateboards so the tagging showed, for realism. 
Viewership at XD increased more than 25 percent—but most of the 
new audience was girls. Boys aged 6 to 14 increased only 10 
percent. The economic downturn also hurt advertising, but Rich 
Ross, the president of Disney Channels Worldwide, was not 
discouraged. “We’ve seen cultural resonance, and it doesn’t come 
overnight,” he said.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What type(s) of segmentation strategy is Disney applying? 
Do you think it will be effective? Why or why not?
2. What steps can Disney take to increase viewership of 
Disney XD among boys?

result of these efforts. Some developers built communities with a resort-style atmosphere 
in desirable locations such as Colorado ski country or the outskirts of a large city such as 
Chicago or San Francisco. However, because of the recession, many such communities have 
actually seen their populations decrease. According to Mark Mather, associate vice president 
of the Population Reference Bureau, “Baby boomers helped fuel housing and population 
growth in retirement areas earlier in the decade, and now they are playing an important role 
in the decline.”33
Teens are another rapidly growing market. The entire scope of Generation Y—those 
born between 1976 and 1997—encompasses about 113 million young Americans, or a little 
more than one-third of the total population. Often called the Millennials, these consumers 
are tech-savvy shoppers who influence not only their own purchases but also those of their 
families and friends. They are educated consumers who comparison shop and usually avoid 
impulse purchases, partly because of the recession and partly because they are spending 
their own money. According to a Nielsen survey, compared with older generations, such as 
the Greatest Generation (those who lived through World War II) and the Baby Boomers, 
Generation Y consumers shop less often but buy more when they do, preferring megastores 
and big box-retailers.34
Statistics can be helpful, but they don’t tell the whole story. Marketers must also

much income they have in order to serve them well. 
Sometimes, marketers must do intensive research 
in order to reach a particular age or gender group, 
or both, as described in the “Hit & Miss” fea-
ture. Finally, they must learn cultural tastes and 
preferences.
Above all, companies must avoid stereotyping 
if they are going to market successfully to a diverse 
group of consumers. One way to do this is to break 
a large group into smaller segments. For instance, 
the Hispanic market is made up of many smaller 
segments, based on country of origin, language, life-
style, and cultural values. In an attempt to target a 
younger Hispanic audience, three television networks 
have begun to offer bilingual, Spanish, and English-
language programming with Hispanic themes. 
Because many Hispanic American teens and young 
adults are bilingual, the networks are trying to cap-
ture their attention while their parents and grandpar-
ents continue to watch Spanish-only programming. 
The mun2 (pronounced “moon-dos,” for Telemundo 
2) network targets young, bicultural Hispanics between 18 and 34. It recently launched a 
half-hour show, The mun2 Look, which explores the influence of American Hispanics on 
today’s fashions. Gloria Medel, the executive producer of the network says that “mun2 
understands that the young contemporary U.S. Latino experience is about standing out and 
embracing a personal style. ‘The mun2 Look’ celebrates our viewers’ uniquely American 
fashion and reflects the cultural creativity unique to the U.S. Latino lifestyle.”35
Entrepreneurs who are members of minority groups may start their own businesses out 
of frustration at not being able to find food, clothing, entertainment, or other goods and ser-
vices that fit their tastes and needs. In fact, 12.5 percent of all businesses in the United States 
are owned by immigrants. Mexicans are the largest group, with 2.22 percent of immigrant-
owned businesses. Motivated by the American dream that hard work will bring success and 
the good life, extended families often work in these businesses, which also support their 
ethnic communities. This localization makes them particularly vulnerable during hard times, 
but many immigrant entrepreneurs remain optimistic. Christos Koskiniotis and his mother

Psychographic Segmentation Lifestyle is the sum of a person’s needs, pref-
erences, motives, attitudes, social habits, and cultural background. In recent years, market-
ing researchers have tried to formulate lifestyle portraits of consumers. This effort has led 
to another strategy for segmenting target markets, psychographic segmentation, which 
divides consumer markets into groups with similar psychological characteristics, values, 
and lifestyles.
Psychographic studies have evaluated motivations for purchases of hundreds of goods 
and services, ranging from soft drinks to healthcare services. Using the resulting data, firms 
tailor their marketing strategies to carefully chosen market segments. A frequently used

method of developing psychographic profiles involves the use of AIO statements—people’s 
verbal descriptions of various attitudes, interests, and opinions. Researchers survey a sample 
of consumers, asking them whether they agree or disagree with each statement. The answers 
are then tabulated and analyzed for use in identifying various lifestyle categories.
Another way to get current information from consumers about their lifestyles is to cre-
ate blogs to which consumers may respond. Companies including Stonyfield Farm, Verizon, 
and Microsoft have hired bloggers to run online Web journals as a way to connect with and 
receive information from consumers. Other firms encourage employees at all levels to use 
blogs to communicate with consumers. General Motors has several blogs at its GMblogs.com 
site, each tailored to a specific brand or consumer interest. The FastLane blog discusses 
GM cars and trucks, inviting consumers to offer their thoughts and ideas. Chevrolet Voltage 
is aimed at fans of the Volt and other electric vehicles. The Lab is where GM’s advanced 
design team talks about its work and invites feedback from community members.37
Although demographic classifications such as age, gender, and income are relatively easy 
to identify and measure, researchers also need to define psychographic categories. Often 
marketing research firms conduct extensive studies of consumers and then share their psy-
chographic data with clients. In addition, businesses look to studies done by sociologists and 
psychologists to help them understand their customers. For instance, while children may 
fall into one age group and their parents in another, they also live certain lifestyles together. 
Recent marketing research reveals that today’s parents are willing and able to spend more on 
goods and services for their children than parents were a generation or two ago. Spending 
on toys and videogames for children topped $41 billion for a recent year in the United 
States.38 These are just a few trends identified by the researchers, but they provide valuable 
information to firms that may be considering developing games, designing the interiors of 
family vehicles, or implementing new wireless plans.
Product-Related Segmentation Using product-related segmentation, 
sellers can divide a consumer market into groups based on buyers’ relationships to the good 
or service. The three most popular approaches to product-related segmentation are based on 
benefits sought, usage rates, and brand loyalty levels.
Segmenting by benefits sought focuses on the attributes that people seek in a good or 
service and the benefits they expect to receive from it. As more firms shift toward consumer 
demand for products that are eco-friendly, marketers find ways to emphasize the benefits 
of these products. Home goods retailer Crate & Barrel has begun to offer tables and chairs 
made of mango wood, which is harvested only after the trees’ fruit-bearing capabilities have 
passed. Consumers can also select a sofa whose cushions are made of recycled fibers that 
are filled with a natural, soy-based foam. According to the company’s Web site, “While our 
collection has featured renewable woods and sustainable materials for a number of years, we 
are now introducing important initiatives that will help make our homes more thoughtful 
environments.”39
Consumer markets can also be segmented according to the amounts of a product that 
people buy and use. Segmentation by product usage rate usually defines such categories as 
heavy users, medium users, and light users. The 80/20 principle states that roughly 80 per-
cent of a product’s revenues come from only 20 percent of its buyers. Companies can now 
pinpoint which of their customers are the heaviest users—and even the most profitable 
customers—and direct their heaviest marketing efforts to those customers.
The third technique for product-related segmentation divides customers by brand 
loyalty—the degree to which consumers recognize, prefer, and insist on a particular brand.

Marketers define groups of consumers with similar degrees of brand loyalty. They then 
attempt to tie loyal customers to a good or service by giving away premiums, which can be 
anything from a logo-emblazoned T-shirt to a pair of free tickets to a concert or sports event.
Segmenting Business Markets
In many ways, the segmentation process for business markets resembles that for con-
sumer markets. However, some specific methods differ. Business markets can be divided 
through geographical segmentation; demographic, or customer-based, segmentation; and 
end-use segmentation.
Geographical segmentation methods for business markets resemble those for consumer 
markets. Many B2B marketers target geographically concentrated industries, such as aircraft 
manufacturing, automobiles, and oil field equipment. Especially on an international scale, 
customer needs, languages, and other variables may require differences in the marketing mix 
from one location to another.
Demographic, or customer-based, segmentation begins with a good or service design 
intended to suit a specific organizational market. Sodexho Marriott Services is the largest 
provider of food services in North America. Its customers include healthcare institutions, 
business and government offices, schools, and colleges and universities. Within these broad 
business segments, Sodexho identifies more specific segments, which might include col-
leges in the South or universities with culturally diverse populations—and differing food 
preferences or dining styles. Sodexho uses data obtained from surveys that cover students’ 
lifestyles, attitudes, preferences for consumer products in general, services, and media cat-
egories. In addition, it uses targeted surveys that identify preferences for restaurant brands 
or certain foods, meal habits, amount of spending, and the like. Marketers evaluate the data, 
which sometime reveal surprising trends. At one university in the rural Northeast, students 
indicated that they liked foods with an international flavor. So Sodexho adapted its offerings 
accordingly.40
To simplify the process of focusing on a particular type of business customer, the federal 
government has developed a system for subdividing the business marketplace into detailed 
segments. The six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) provides a 
common classification system used by the member nations of NAFTA (the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico). It divides industries into broad categories such as agriculture, forestry, 
and fishing; manufacturing; transportation; and retail and wholesale trade. Each major cate-
gory is further subdivided into smaller segments—such as gas stations with convenience food 
and warehouse clubs—for more detailed information and to facilitate comparison among the 
member-nations.
Another way to group firms by their demographics is to segment them by size based on 
their sales revenues or numbers of employees. Some firms collect data from visitors to its 
Web site and use the data to segment customers by size. Modern information processing 
also enables companies to segment business markets based on how much they buy, not just 
how big they are.
End-use segmentation focuses on the precise way a B2B purchaser will use a product. 
Resembling benefits-sought segmentation for consumer markets, this method helps small 
and mid-size companies target specific end-user markets rather than competing directly with 
large firms for wider customer groups. A company might also design a marketing mix based 
on certain criteria for making a purchase.

Part 4  Marketing Management
Consumer Behavior
A fundamental marketing task is to find out why people buy one product and not 
another. The answer requires an understanding of consumer behavior, the actions of ulti-
mate consumers directly involved in obtaining, consuming, and disposing of products and 
the decision processes that precede and follow these actions.
Determinants of Consumer Behavior
By studying people’s purchasing behavior, businesses can identify consumers’ attitudes 
toward and uses of their products. This information also helps marketers reach their tar-
geted customers. Both personal and interpersonal factors influence the way buyers behave. 
Personal influences on consumer behavior include individual needs and motives, per-
ceptions, attitudes, learned experiences, and self-concept. For instance, today people are 
constantly looking for ways to save time, so firms do everything they can to provide goods 
and services designed for convenience. However, when it comes to products such as dinner 
foods, consumers want convenience, but they also want to enjoy the flavor of a home-cooked 
meal and spend quality time with their families. So companies such as Stouffer’s offer frozen 
lasagna or manicotti in family sizes, and supermarkets have entire sections devoted to freshly 
prepared take-out meals that range from roast turkey to filet mignon.
McDonald’s is betting that consumers who drink premium coffee beverages also like to 
buy them at bargain prices. In many U.S. locations, McDonald’s has placed McCafé coffee 
bars—serving cappuccinos, lattes, and mochas—near the cash register. Almost 70 percent of 
McDonald’s stores now serve these beverages, putting the company in direct competition 
with Starbucks.41
The interpersonal determinants of consumer behavior include cultural, social, and fam-
ily influences. In the area of convenience foods, cultural, social, and family influences come 
into play as much as an individual’s need to save time. Understanding that many consumers 
value the time they spend with their families and want to care for them by providing good 
nutrition, marketers often emphasize these values in advertisements for convenience food 
products.
Sometimes external events influence consumer behavior. One study suggests that as a 
result of the recession, consumers may have permanently altered their buying and spending 
behavior. The survey found that 72 percent of consumers said that they had significantly 
or somewhat changed their shopping habits; only 7 percent said they had made no change. 
Manufacturers and retailers—and especially small businesses—will need to create new mar-
keting strategies in response to these challenges.42
Determinants of Business Buying Behavior
Because a number of people can influence purchases of B2B products, business buy-
ers face a variety of organizational influences in addition to their own preferences. A design 
engineer may help set the specifications that potential vendors must satisfy. A procurement 
manager may invite selected companies to bid on a purchase. A production supervisor may 
evaluate the operational aspects of the proposals that the firm receives, and the vice president 
of manufacturing may head a committee making the final decision.

Steps in the Consumer 
Behavior Process
Consumer decision making follows the sequen-
tial process outlined in Figure 11.6, with interper-
sonal and personal influences affecting every step. 
The process begins when the consumer recognizes 
a problem or opportunity. If someone needs a new 
pair of shoes, that need becomes a problem to solve. 
If you receive a promotion at work and a 20 percent 
salary increase, that change may also become a pur-
chase opportunity.
To solve the problem or take advantage of 
the opportunity, the consumer seeks information 
about his or her intended purchase and evaluates 
alternatives, such as available brands. The goal 
is to find the best response to the problem 
or opportunity.
Eventually, the consumer reaches a decision 
and completes the transaction. Later, he or she 
evaluates the experience by making a postpurchase 
evaluation. Feelings about the experience serve 
as feedback that will influence future purchase 
decisions. The various steps in the sequence are 
affected by both interpersonal and personal 
factors.
Relationship Marketing
The past decade has brought rapid change to most industries, as customers have become 
better-informed and more-demanding purchasers through closely comparing competing 
goods and services. They expect, even demand, new benefits from the companies that 
supply them, making it harder for firms to gain a competitive advantage based on product 
features alone.
In today’s hypercompetitive era, businesses need to find new ways of relating to cus-
tomers if they hope to maintain long-term success. Businesses are developing strategies and 
tactics that draw them into tighter connections with their customers, suppliers, and even 
employees. As a result, many firms are turning their attention to the issues of relationship 
marketing. Relationship marketing goes beyond an effort toward making the sale. Instead, 
it develops and maintains long-term, cost-effective exchange relationships with partners. 
These partners include individual customers, suppliers, and employees. As its ultimate goal, 
relationship marketing seeks to achieve customer satisfaction.
Managing relationships instead of simply completing transactions often leads to creative 
partnerships. However, customers enter into relationships with firms only if they are assured 
that the relationship will somehow benefit them. As the intensity of commitment increases, 
so does the likelihood of a business continuing a long-term relationship with its customers.

Part 4  Marketing Management
Calming the Angry Customer
In any business, an angry customer is a challenge representing not only an 
immediate problem but also a potential loss of future business. The customer 
may be upset over poor service or a broken product, frustrated by lack of 
attention from the company, or just plain demanding. You, the businessper-
son, should view this customer not as a disruption but as an opportunity to 
see your company from the outside. With a little bit of common sense, good 
personal skills, and knowledge of your company and its products, you can very 
likely turn the customer’s dissatisfaction into satisfaction.
 • Remain calm and professional. The customer isn’t angry with you personally. 
Let the customer speak ﬁ rst, and listen carefully as he or she states the 
problem. Make written notes. Acknowledge the customer’s anger, then 
assure him or her that you will correct the situation.
 • Repeat the customer’s stated problem. Using your own words assures the 
customer that you have been listening. For example, you might say, “The 
shoes you received were the right color but the wrong size.” Make sure 
you understand the problem before offering a solution.
 • Focus on the solution. Having procedures in place beforehand can help you 
resolve a problem quickly. If you can’t solve the problem yourself, immedi-
ately refer it to someone who can. Fast action will let the customer know 
that you are on his or her side.
 • Thank the customer for his or her patience. By bringing the problem to your atten-
tion, the customer is actually giving you an opportunity to improve service 
to all your clients.
 • Follow up. If appropriate, send an e-mail or make a phone call to make sure 
the correct pair of shoes arrived. Your professionalism will strengthen the 
customer’s relationship with your ﬁ rm—and positive word of mouth may 
even bring you new customers.

Businesses are building relationships by partnering 
with customers, suppliers, and other businesses. 
Timberland, maker of footwear and clothing, cre-
ates many partnerships that foster long-term rela-
tionships. The firm partners with not-for-profit 
organizations such as CARE, City Year, and Clean 
Air–Cool Planet to complete service projects for 
communities and the environment. Through its 
Serv-a-Palooza, hundreds of Timberland employ-
ees engage in volunteer tasks in their communities. 
Those opportunities even extend to customers who 
have expressed an interest in participating in pro-
grams in their own regions. If you want to volun-
teer for a food drive or to help restore a marsh, just 
log on to the Timberland Web site to see what’s 
available. All of these activities help build relation-
ships with customers, communities, and other 
organizations.43
Benefits of Relationship 
Marketing
Relationship marketing helps all parties 
involved. In addition to providing mutual protec-
tion against competitors, businesses that forge 
solid links with vendors and customers are often 
rewarded with lower costs and higher profits than 
they would generate on their own. Long-term 
agreements with a few high-quality suppliers fre-
quently reduce a firm’s production costs. Unlike 
one-time sales, these ongoing relationships encour-
age suppliers to offer customers preferential treat-
ment, quickly adjusting shipments to accommodate 
changes in orders and correcting any quality prob-
lems that might arise.
Good relationships with customers can be vital 
strategic weapons for a firm. By identifying current 
purchasers and maintaining positive relationships 
with them, organizations can efficiently target their 
best customers. Studying current customers’ buy-
ing habits and preferences can help marketers iden-
tify potential new customers and establish ongoing 
contact with them. Attracting a new customer 
can cost five times as much as keeping an existing 
one. Not only do marketing costs go down, but 
long-term customers usually buy more, require 

Chapter 11  Customer-Driven Marketing
377
less service, refer other customers, and provide valuable feedback. Together, these elements 
contribute to a higher lifetime value of a customer—the revenues and intangible ben-
efits (referrals and customer feedback) from the customer over the life of the relationship, 
minus the amount the company must spend to acquire and serve that customer. Keeping that 
customer may occasionally require some extra effort, especially if the customer has become 
upset or dissatisfied with a good or service. But good marketers can overcome this particular 
challenge, as described in the “Business Etiquette” feature.
Businesses also benefit from strong relationships with other companies. Purchasers who 
repeatedly buy from one business may find that they save time and gain service quality as 
the business learns their specific needs. Some relationship-oriented companies also custom-
ize items based on customer preferences. Because many businesses reward loyal customers 
with discounts or bonuses, some buyers may even find that they save money by developing 
long-term relationships. Alliances with other firms to serve the same customers also can be 
rewarding. The partners combine their capabilities and resources to accomplish goals that 
they could not reach on their own. In addition, alliances with other firms may help busi-
nesses develop the skills and experience they need to successfully enter new markets or 
improve service to current customers.
Tools for Nurturing Customer Relationships
Although relationship marketing has important benefits for both customers and 
businesses, most relationship-oriented businesses quickly discover that some customers 
generate more profitable business than others. If 20 percent of a firm’s customers 
account for 80 percent of its sales and profits—the 80/20 principle mentioned earlier 
in the chapter—a customer in that category undoubtedly has a higher lifetime value than a 
customer who buys only once or twice or who makes small purchases.
While businesses shouldn’t ignore any customer, they need to allocate their marketing 
resources wisely. A firm may choose to customize goods or services for high-value custom-
ers while working to increase repeat sales of stock products to less-valuable customers. 
Differentiating between these two groups also helps marketers focus on each in an effort to 
increase their commitment.
Frequency Marketing and Affinity Marketing Programs Popular 
techniques through which firms try to build and protect customer relationships include 
frequent-buyer or -user programs. These so-called frequency marketing programs reward 
purchasers with cash, rebates, merchandise, or other premiums. Frequency programs have 
grown more sophisticated over the years. They offer more personalization and customization 
than in the past. Airlines, hotel groups, restaurants, and many retailers including supermar-
kets offer frequency programs. Customers who join the Marriott Rewards program have the 
option to spend their earned points at nearly 3,000 hotels, resorts, spas, and golf locations in 
67 countries and territories worldwide.44
Affinity programs are another tool for building emotional links with customers. An 
affinity program is a marketing effort sponsored by an organization that solicits involvement 
by individuals who share common interests and activities. Affinity programs are common in 
the credit card industry. For instance, a person can sign up for a credit card emblazoned with 
lifetime value of a 
customer revenues and 
intangible benefits (refer-
rals and customer feed-
back) from a customer over 
the life of the relationship, 
minus the amount the com-
pany must spend to acquire 
and serve that customer.

Many businesses also use comarketing and cobranding. In 
a comarketing deal, two businesses jointly market each oth-
er’s products. When two or more businesses link their names 
to a single product, cobranding occurs. When two seemingly 
unlikely businesses team up, the marketing sparks fly—and 
two very different groups of consumers may come together 
to buy the same product. Nike and iPod have marketed the 
Nike + iPod Sport kit, which allows a runner to insert a special 
sensor into a built-in pocket in a Nike+ shoe, which synchro-
nizes the runner’s activity with workout data and music that 
plays through the iPod. Enthusiasts can also purchase specially 
designed Nike workout apparel that has pockets designed to 
hold an iPod nano itself.45
One-on-One Marketing The ability to customize products and rapidly deliver 
goods and services has become increasingly dependent on technology such as computer-
aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM). The Internet offers a way for businesses to 
connect with customers in a direct and intimate manner. Companies can take orders for cus-
tomized products, gather data about buyers, and predict what items a customer might want 
in the future. Computer databases provide strong support for effective relationship market-
ing. Marketers can maintain databases on customer tastes, price-range preferences, and life-
styles, and they can quickly obtain names and other information about promising prospects. 
Amazon.com greets each online customer with a list of suggested books he or she might like 
to purchase. Many online retailers send their customers e-mails about upcoming sales, new 
products, and special events.
Small and large companies often rely on customer relationship management (CRM) soft-
ware technology that helps them gather, sort, and interpret data about customers. Software 
firms develop this software in order to help businesses build and manage their relationships 
with customers. QueueBuster is one such product. The software offers callers the choice of 
receiving an automated return call instead of waiting on hold for the next available represen-
tative. After implementing the software, travel agency STA reported that its customer sat-
isfaction ratings had improved to 98 percent. This simple solution to customers’ frustration 
probably not only helped build customer loyalty but also helped save STA from lost business 
as well.46

Summary of Learning Goals
Chapter 11  Customer-Driven Marketing
Summarize the ways in which marketing creates utility.
Utility is the ability of a good or service to satisfy the wants 
and needs of customers. The production function creates 
form utility by converting inputs to finished goods and serv-
ices. Marketing creates time, place, and ownership utility 
by making the product available when and where consum-
ers want to buy and by arranging for orderly transfers of 
ownership.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 What is utility? Utility is the ability of a good or ser-
vice to satisfy the wants and needs of customers.
1.2 Identify ways in which marketing creates utility. 
Marketing creates time utility by making a good or service 
available when customers want to purchase it, place utility by 
making the product available in a convenient location, and 
ownership utility by transferring the product from the buyer 
to the seller.
Discuss the marketing concept.
The marketing concept refers to a companywide customer 
orientation with the objective of achieving long-run success. 
This concept is essential in today’s marketplace, which is 
primarily a buyer’s market, meaning buyers can choose from 
an abundance of goods and services. Marketing now centers 
on the satisfaction of customers and building long-term rela-
tionships with those customers.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 What is the marketing concept? The marketing 
concept is a companywide customer orientation with the 
objective of achieving long-run success. According to 
the marketing concept, success begins with the customer.
2.2 How is the marketing concept tied to the relation-
ship era of marketing? Most marketing now centers on the 
satisfaction of customers and building long-term relation-
ships with them, rather than simply producing and selling 
goods and services.
Describe not-for-profit marketing, and identify the five 
major categories of nontraditional marketing.
Not-for-profit organizations must engage in marketing just 
as for-profit firms do. Not-for-profit organizations operate 
in both the public and private sectors, and use marketing 
to obtain volunteers and donations, make people aware of 
their existence, achieve certain goals for society, and so on. 
Not-for-profit organizations may engage in several types 
of nontraditional marketing—person, place, event, cause, 
or organization marketing. They may rely on one type or a 
combination.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 Why do not-for-profit organizations engage in 
marketing? Not-for-profit organizations use marketing to 
attract volunteers and donors, communicate their message, 
and achieve their societal goals.
3.2 What are the five types of nontraditional marketing 
used by not-for-profit organizations? The five types of 
nontraditional marketing are person, place, event, cause, and 
organization marketing.
Outline the basic steps in developing a marketing 
strategy.
All organizations develop marketing strategies to reach 
customers. This process involves analyzing the overall 
market, selecting a target market, and developing a 
marketing mix that blends elements related to product, 
distribution, promotion, and pricing decisions.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 Distinguish between consumer products and busi-
ness products. Business products are goods and services 
purchased to be used, either directly or indirectly, in the 
production of other goods for resale. Consumer products are 
purchased by end users.
4.2 What are the steps in developing a marketing 
strategy? The steps in developing a marketing strategy are 
to analyze the overall market, select a target market, and 
develop a marketing mix.
Describe the marketing research function.
Marketing research is the information-gathering function 
that links marketers to the marketplace. It provides valu-
able information about potential target markets. Firms may 
generate internal data or gather external data. They may use 
secondary data or conduct research to obtain primary data. 
Data mining, which involves computer searches through cus-
tomer data to detect patterns or relationships, is one helpful 
tool in forecasting various trends such as sales revenues and 
consumer behavior.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 What is the difference between primary data and 
secondary data? Secondary data are previously published 
facts that are inexpensive to retrieve and easy to obtain. 
Primary data are collected firsthand through observation or 
surveys.
5.2 What is data mining? Data mining involves computer 
searches through customer data in order to evaluate the data 
and identify useful trends.

Identify and explain each of the methods available for 
segmenting consumer and business markets.
Consumer markets can be divided according to four criteria: 
geographical factors; demographic characteristics, such as 
age and family size; psychographic variables, which involve 
behavioral and lifestyle profiles; and product-related vari-
ables, such as the benefits consumers seek when buying a 
product or the degree of brand loyalty they feel toward it. 
Business markets are segmented according to three criteria: 
geographical characteristics, customer-based specifications 
for products, and end-user applications.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 What is the most common form of segmentation for 
consumer markets? Demographics is the most commonly 
used consumer market segmentation method.
6.2 What are the three approaches to product-related 
segmentation? The three approaches to product-related 
segmentation are by benefits sought, product usage rate, and 
brand loyalty.
6.3 What is end-use segmentation in the B2B market? 
End-use segmentation focuses on the precise way a B2B pur-
chaser will use a product.
Outline the determinants of consumer behavior.
Consumer behavior refers to the actions of ultimate con-
sumers with direct effects on obtaining, consuming, and 
disposing of products, as well as the decision processes 
that precede and follow these actions. Personal influences 
on consumer behavior include an individual’s needs and 
motives, perceptions, attitudes, learned experiences, and 
self-concept. The interpersonal determinants include cul-
tural influences, social influences, and family influences. 
A number of people within a firm may participate in busi-
ness purchase decisions, so business buyers must consider a 
variety of organizational influences in addition to their own 
preferences.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 Define consumer behavior. Consumer behavior refers 
to the actions of ultimate consumers directly involved in 
obtaining, consuming, and disposing of products, along with 
the decision processes surrounding these actions.
7.2 What are some determinants of consumer behavior? 
Determinants of consumer behavior include both personal 
influences and interpersonal influences. Personal influences 
include an individual’s needs and motives; perceptions, atti-
tudes, and experiences; and self-concept. Interpersonal influ-
ences include cultural, social and family influences.
Discuss the benefits of and tools for relationship 
marketing.
Relationship marketing is an organization’s attempt to 
develop long-term, cost-effective links with individual cus-
tomers for mutual benefit. Good relationships with custom-
ers can be a vital strategic weapon for a firm. By identifying 
current purchasers and maintaining a positive relationship 
with them, an organization can efficiently target its best 
customers, fulfill their needs, and create loyalty. Information 
technologies, frequency and affinity programs, and one-on-
one efforts all help build relationships with customers.
Assessment Check Answers 
8.1 What is the lifetime value of a customer? The life-
time value of a customer incorporates the revenues and 
intangible benefits from the customer over the life of the 
relationship with a firm, minus the amount the company 
must spend to acquire and serve the customer.
8.2 Discuss the increasing importance of one-on-one 
marketing efforts. One-on-one marketing is increasing in 
importance as consumers demand more customization in 
goods and services. It is also increasingly dependent on tech-
nology such as computer-aided design and manufacturing 
(CAD/CAM). The Internet also offers a way for businesses 
to connect with customers in a direct and personal manner.

c. 
Red Cross
 
d. 
Salvation Army
3. As a marketer, if you can find ways to classify your firm’s 
goods and services as both business and consumer products, 
most likely your company’s sales will increase as you build 
relationships with a new category of customers. On your 
own or with a classmate, choose one of the following prod-
ucts, and outline a marketing strategy for attracting the clas-
sification of customer that is opposite from the one listed in 
parentheses.
 
a. 
hybrid car (consumer)
 
b. 
LCD TV (consumer)

limousine service (business)
 
d. 
office furniture (business)
4. Think of two situations in which you have been a customer: 
one in which you were satisfied with the merchandise you 
received and one in which you were not. Make a list of the 
reasons you were satisfied in the first case and another list of 
the reasons you were not satisfied in the second case. Would 
you say that the failure was the result of the seller not under-
standing your needs?

5. Comarketing and cobranding are techniques that organiza-
tions often use to market their own and each other’s prod-
ucts, such as Nike running shoes and the Apple iPod. On 
your own or with a classmate, choose two firms with goods 
and/or services you think would work well together for 
comarketing separate products or cobranding a single prod-
uct. Then create an advertisement for your comarketing or 
cobranding effort.

CASE 1.2
Case 11.1
Advertising on Facebook: Unlimited Potential?
With 400 million members, Facebook is a global 
social network of unprecedented size—and untold poten-
tial revenue. Users are familiar with the advertisements in 
the right-hand margin of certain pages. Some big names, 
such as Walmart and PepsiCo, post ads, but so do many 
smaller companies. What users may not realize is that 
advertisers can use members’ personal information—age, 
location, interests, level of education, and connections 
within Facebook—to refine the targeting of ads. For 
example, women who change their relationship status 
to “engaged” will suddenly start seeing ads from local 
caterers, planners, wedding-gown stores, photographers, 
and so on. In contrast, Google uses keywords and search 
histories to target ads.
Facebook recently surpassed Google as the most 
visited site in the United States. Eager to reach Facebook’s 
much larger membership, advertisers are switching from 
Google to Facebook, which some predict will earn $2 billion 
from global advertising. One study found that 78 percent of 
Facebook users return to Facebook to see more news sto-
ries; only 67 percent of Google News users do so. Facebook 
traffic is up 185 percent; Google is up only 9 percent.
Facebook’s “self-service” ads usually appear on a 
user’s profile page and consist of a small photo and some 
text. An advertiser establishes a daily budget—there is no 
minimum—using Facebook’s ad-creation tool. When the 
advertiser has spent the day’s entire budget, Facebook 
stops running the ad. If money is left over, the advertiser 
can roll it over to the next day’s budget. Advertisers pay 
either “by impression,” every time a user views the ad, or 
“per click,” every time a user actually clicks on the link in 
the ad to open the company’s Web site.
Facebook members can become “fans” of an adver-
tiser’s Facebook page or can reply to an invitation to a 
company-sponsored event through Facebook. But as in 
other media, consumers have a deep mistrust of Web 
advertising as a credible source of information. With ads 
on Facebook becoming omnipresent, click-through rates 
(CTRs) have fallen to about 0.3 percent from close to 3 
percent. Of course, the point is to get people to look at 
the ads, which most users ignore. When promoting a 
contest, one advertiser found that humor—and pictures of 
cute puppies and kittens—increased his CTR even more 
than did offers of prizes.

Chapter 11  Customer-Driven Marketing

Chapter 11  Customer-Driven Marketing
Some Facebook users find the ads off-putting—or 
worse—because advertisers can target them so precisely. 
But Dan Rose, the vice president for business development 
at Facebook, predicted that the quality of the ads would 
improve as more companies use the system.
Facebook requires the text and photo in an ad to be 
relevant to what is being advertised. However, Facebook 
does not review ads before they are posted. The only 
review system is user feedback. If a user reports an ad as 
misleading, offensive, uninteresting, irrelevant, repetitive, 
or “other,” Facebook deletes the ad from that user’s page. 
The more people ask for an ad to be removed, the less likely 
Facebook is to allow it be posted on other people’s pages.
Some observers predict that Facebook will transform 
Web advertising and even the advertising industry itself. 
Facebook’s “Connect” technology allows members to take 
their social networks with them as they browse the Internet. 
And just as in the real world, in the virtual world people are 
much more likely to value the opinions of their friends more 
than those of people—or advertisers—they don’t know.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Why do advertisers continue to post ads on 
Facebook, even though the click-through 
response rate is so low?
2. How does Web advertising affect consumer 
behavior? Does it help build customer relation-
ships or not?

Marketing Gone Wrong: Johnson & Johnson and Risperdal
Case 11.2
Several years ago, the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved Johnson & Johnson’s drug Risperdal to 
treat psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, in adults. 
However, the National Institute of Mental Health found 
that schizophrenia affects only about 1.1 percent of adults 
in the United States. According to a lawsuit by the state 
of Louisiana, Johnson & Johnson therefore decided to seek 
a wider market for the drug by indirectly promoting it for 
other purposes.
Under U.S. law, if the FDA has approved a drug for 
treating at least one disorder, doctors are permitted to 
prescribe it “off label,” for any other disorder they think 
the drug will help—even if the FDA has not approved 
it for that disorder. (The condition the drug is intended 
to treat must be stated on the labeling.) However, drug 
manufacturers are forbidden to promote a drug for any 
other use than the FDA-approved one.
Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice charged 
Johnson & Johnson with paying hundreds of millions of 
dollars in kickbacks to Omnicare Inc. to buy and pro-
mote Risperdal, among other drugs, for off-label uses. 
Omnicare, the largest pharmacy for U.S. nursing-home 
patients, allegedly advocated prescribing Risperdal for 
elderly patients with Alzheimer’s disease—even though 
the FDA never approved Risperdal for treating Alzheimer’s. 
Johnson & Johnson stated, “We believe airing the facts 
will confirm that our conduct, including rebating programs 
like those the government now challenges, was lawful and 
appropriate. We look forward to the opportunity to pres-
ent our evidence in court.”
As far back as 1994—just one year after it approved 
Risperdal for psychotic disorders—the FDA ordered 
Johnson & Johnson to stop its claims that Risperdal 
was more effective than competing drugs. In 1999, the 
FDA warned the company that its marketing literature 
exaggerated Risperdal’s benefits for elderly patients 
with Alzheimer’s disease and understated the risks. 
Nonetheless, a Johnson & Johnson business plan revealed 
the company’s intention to increase Risperdal’s sales to 
these vulnerable patients well into the 21st century (as 
Baby Boomers age). Sales of Risperdal peaked at $4.5 
billion in 2007, before the patent expired and other com-
panies could legally manufacture cheaper, generic versions 
of the drug.

Part 4  Marketing Management
384
In 2005, the FDA issued a public health advisory, 
warning that Risperdal and similar drugs actually increased 
the chances of death among elderly Alzheimer’s patients, 
usually from heart failure or pneumonia. The FDA has also 
required Risperdal to carry a “black box” warning, the 
most stringent in the FDA’s arsenal.
Ten states have filed lawsuits against Johnson & 
Johnson for promoting Risperdal off label. Louisiana sued 
to force the company to pay millions of dollars in fines 
and to regain public money spent on Risperdal. Johnson 
& Johnson’s lawyers argued that Louisiana did not cite 
any evidence of misrepresentation or off-label promotion. 
The company also claimed that there was no connection 
between its marketing and Louisiana doctors’ decision 
to prescribe Risperdal. The judge rejected this argument, 
and the trial date was set. A spokesman for Johnson & 
Johnson said that the case “should be decided on the 
body of evidence, including testimony, not on the basis of 
excerpts from documents.” The company has not put any 
money aside toward a settlement.
Omnicare paid $98 million to settle charges of run-
ning kickback plans with nursing homes and other drug 
manufacturers. Neither Omnicare nor Johnson & Johnson 
acknowledged doing anything wrong.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Do you think that recommending nonapproved 
uses of a drug is an appropriate marketing 
strategy? Why or why not?
2. Which market segmentation strategy do you 
think Johnson & Johnson was using when it 
decided to promote Risperdal for Alzheimer’s 
patients? What did the company fail to take 
into account when developing this strategy?

Zipcar and UNH: Customer-Driven Marketing
CASE 1.3
Case 11.3
When you’re a college student, getting around cam-
pus (or off-campus) can sometimes be a challenge. You 
can walk. You can ride your bike or your skateboard. But 
when rain is pummeling your backpack or when you have 
to carry that heavy box of marketing flyers across campus, 
you wish you had a car—not to mention if you want to 
head off-campus for a weekend road trip. So you decide 
to bring a car to campus, but discover that you’re fork-
ing over several hundred dollars for a parking permit and 
you can’t find a place to park anyway. Then there’s the 
expense of gas and insurance, and the nattering of friends 
who want a ride or who want to borrow your car—just 
for an hour or an evening. Depending on where you go 
to school, Zipcar has got you covered. If you happen to 
attend the University of New Hampshire, you’re in luck.
Zipcar is a car-sharing network based in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts that operates in metropolitan areas and 
on university campuses around the U.S., Canada, and 
the United Kingdom. Car-sharing was already popular in 
Europe ten years ago when Zipcar founders decided to see 
if the idea would fly in the U.S. Shortly after its introduc-
tion to urban dwellers and U.S. students, Zipcar’s message 
had wheels.
At the University of New Hampshire (UNH), students 
and faculty already had several transportation options, 
including an Amtrak station nearby and several bus ser-
vices. But Brett Pasinella, who works for the University 
Office of Sustainability, wanted to find a way to link the 
different transportation options and expand them in a 
sustainable fashion. His research told him that Zipcar fit 
UNH’s existing options. “We went through a bidding pro-
cess to get the right company,” Pasinella says. The firm 
had to meet UNH’s requirement that membership include 
insurance and fuel. “Zipcar really stood out because of 
their technology and understanding of the services and 
what we were looking for,” explainsPasinella. But UNH 
still had to sell the idea to budget-conscious students in 
order to make it work.
The Zipcar system is simple: for a $35 annual fee, 
UNH students or faculty get round-the-clock access to 

Chapter 11  Customer-Driven Marketing
385
Chapter 11  Customer-Driven Marketing
Zipcars that are parked in designated parking spots 
around campus. When they join, members receive their 
own Zipcard (like a key card) that unlocks any Zipcar. 
Members reserve a car online, then use their Zipcard to 
access it. Gas and insurance are included with member-
ship, as well as an average of 180 miles per day.
To sell the concept to UNH students, Brett Pasinella 
engaged a senior class of marketing students to develop a 
marketing plan for all the transportation systems available 
on campus. The class split into teams, one of which chose 
the Zipcar project. The marketing students created presen-
tations designed to answer questions and help classmates 
overcome the hurdle of a $35 fee. Once they realized that 
an annual parking permit at UNH is $400—and that gas 
and insurance are included with Zipcar membership—they 
began to recognize the benefits. In addition, they saw 
Zipcars parked around the campus so they became familiar 
with the brand.
Brett Pasinella notes that UNH is also a sustainable 
campus, and that most of his job is focused on finding 
ways to reduce waste and energy use—including through-
out the university’s transportation system. Zipcar’s entire 
fleet is EPA Smart Way certified and includes hybrids as 
well as other zero-emission vehicles. But Pasinella and 
UNH marketing student Erin Badger point out the reali-
ties of college life. “A lot of students will focus on the fact 
that Zipcar is easier for them and saves them money,” 
concedes Erin Badger. “We have to promote Zipcar toward 
what students are looking for, and those are the two big-
gest factors.”
After the first year in operation at UNH, Zipcar mem-
bership is growing. Pasinella plans to market the service 
proactively in coming years—sending Zipcar information 
to incoming students and faculty before they arrive on 
campus with their own vehicles. UNH conducted a survey 
of members and discovered that users like the convenience 
and visibility of the cars as well as the low cost. Erin 
Badger might be the Zipcar’s best spokesperson at UNH. 
“I wish I’d figured it out a lot sooner,” she admits. She 
accrued a lot of parking tickets around campus before she 
joined Zipcar. “I’d have saved myself a lot of money if I’d 
joined sooner,” she says.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Who is Zipcar’s target market? How might 
Zipcar’s market be further segmented?
2. Describe how Zipcar might create a marketing 
mix for colleges and universities.
3. Just as Zipcar must market to UNH, UNH in 
turn must market the Zipcar concept to its 
customers—students and faculty. Describe 
how studying consumer behavior could help 
select a strategy for UNH’s marketing effort.
4. What steps can Zipcar take to manage its rela-
tionship with UNH?

 O n a recent Sunday afternoon, José Ruíz 
of Lindsay, California, and his cousin suddenly 
found themselves in a life-and-death situation. 
A shotgun-wielding carjacker forced them out of 
Ruíz’s Chevy Tahoe, robbed them, and drove the 
off in the vehicle. Ruíz quickly notified the police 
that his car had just been stolen—and that it had 
OnStar on board. At his request, the police asked 
OnStar to track the car. First, OnStar’s subscriber 
service launched its Remote Ignition Block. If the 
suspect stopped the car before the police had it 
in sight, he would not be able to restart it. Then, 
once the pursuing officers saw the car, they asked 
OnStar to initiate Stolen Vehicle Slowdown (SVS), 
which slowed the car to a complete stop. At this 
point, the suspect tried to flee on foot but was 
quickly captured by the police. Ruíz’s car was safely 
recovered without the need for a car chase that 
might have involved injuries. The total time since 
OnStar was first contacted: 16 minutes.
The National Insurance Crime Bureau reports that 
although vehicle theft has declined steadily for a 
number of years, every day an average of 2,650 
vehicles are stolen in the United States. That’s one 
theft every 33 seconds. According to the National 
Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, in a 
recent year, 334 people died in crashes stemming 
from police pursuits of stolen vehicles. Since its 
debut that year, OnStar’s Stolen Vehicle Service has 
been used more than 50 times in various situations, 
eliminating the possibility of a high-speed chase.
OnStar is a wholly owned subsidiary of General 
Motors, which has made the service standard in 
almost all of its vehicles manufactured since 2007. 
OnStar currently has almost 6 million subscribers 
in the United States and Canada. Three buttons in 
the dashboard of an OnStar-equipped vehicle link 
the subscriber to 24-hour access to OnStar advisors, 
a direct connection to emergency assistance, and 
hands-free calling.
Stolen Vehicle Slowdown (SVS) technology was put 
into production as part of the OnStar subscription 
service. Here is how SVS works: Once a subscriber 
reports a stolen vehicle to the police and OnStar 
verifies the report, the subscriber can request Stolen 
Vehicle Assistance. The OnStar advisor uses global 
positioning satellite (GPS) technology to determine 
the exact location of the vehicle, then relays that 
information only to the police. When the police 
have the vehicle in a clear line of sight and 
determine that conditions are safe, they ask the 
OnStar advisor to slow the vehicle down. The advisor 
sends a signal directly to the vehicle to reduce power 
to the engine and gradually slow the car down to 
idle speed. SVS doesn’t interfere with other systems, 
such as power steering and brakes. This ensures 
that in a nontheft situation—for example, if the 
subscriber is driving and has suddenly been taken 
ill or is otherwise incapacitated—he or she can steer 
the vehicle to the side of the road and bring it safely 
to a stop.
OnStar’s SVS technology won a Silver Edison 
Award for Best New Product of the Year in the 
technological innovation category. The Edison 
Awards are peer-reviewed honors chosen by the 
Marketing Executives Networking Group (MENG), 
a nonprofit organization of American business 
executives and academics. The awards symbolize 
Thomas Edison’s own “persistence and excellence” 
in pursuit of new technology. Chris Preuss, the 
president of OnStar, said, “Stolen Vehicle Slowdown 
is a prime example of the rapid pace of innovation 
underway at OnStar. We are developing services 
that not only keep our subscribers safe, but virtually 
everyone on the road as well.”1

Overview
12
In this chapter we examine ways in 
which organizations design and implement 
marketing strategies that address customers’ 
needs and wants. Two of the most powerful 
such tools are strategies that relate to prod-
ucts, which include both goods and services, 
and those that relate to the distribution of 
those products.
As the story of the subscriber service 
OnStar illustrates, successful companies 
are keenly aware of their customers’ needs. 
OnStar continues to perfect its formula for 
success with General Motors customers by 
improving its technology through research 
and innovation. In addition, the creation of 
new products is the lifeblood of an orga-
nization. Because products do not remain 
economically viable forever, companies must 
constantly develop new ones to ensure their 
survival and long-term growth. Providing 
new services to meets its subscribers’ needs 
ensures that OnStar will continue to moti-
vate consumers to select GM vehicles.
This chapter focuses on the first two 
elements of the marketing mix: product 
and distribution. Our discussion of 
product strategy begins by describing 
the classifications of goods and services, 
customer service, product lines and the 
product mix, and the product life cycle. 
Companies often shape their marketing 
strategies differently when they are 
introducing a new product, when the prod-
uct has established itself in the marketplace, 
and when it is declining in popularity. We 
also discuss product identification through 
brand name and distinctive packaging, and 
the ways in which companies foster loyalty 
to their brands to keep customers coming 
back for more.
Distribution, the second mix variable 
discussed, focuses on moving goods and 
services from producer to wholesaler to 
retailer to buyers. Managing the distribution 
process includes making decisions such as 
what kind of wholesaler to use and where to 
offer products for sale. Retailers can range 
from specialty stores to factory outlets and 
everything in between, and they must choose 
appropriate customer service, pricing, and 
location strategies in order to succeed. The 
chapter concludes with a look at logistics, 
the process of coordinating the flow of infor-
mation, goods, and services among suppliers 
and on to final consumers.
Product Strategy
Most people respond to the question “What is a product?” by listing its physical fea-
tures. By contrast, marketers take a broader view. To them, a product is a bundle of physi-
cal, service, and symbolic characteristics designed to satisfy consumer wants. The chief 
executive officer of a major tool manufacturer once startled his stockholders with this state-
ment: “Last year our customers bought over 1 million quarter-inch drill bits, and none of 
product bundle of physi-
cal, service, and symbolic 
characteristics designed to 
satisfy consumer wants.

them wanted to buy the product. They all wanted quarter-inch holes.” Product strategy 
involves considerably more than just producing a good or service; instead, it focuses on ben-
efits. The marketing conception of a product includes decisions about package design, brand 
name, trademarks, warranties, product image, new-product development, and customer ser-
vice. Think, for instance, about your favorite soft drink. Do you like it for its taste alone? Or 
do other attributes, such as clever ads, attractive packaging, ease of purchase from vending 
machines and other convenient locations, and overall image, also attract you? These other 
attributes may influence your choice more than you realize.
Classifying Goods and Services
Marketers have found it useful to classify goods and services as either B2C or B2B, 
depending on whether the purchasers of the particular item are consumers or businesses. 
These classifications can be subdivided further, and each type requires a different competi-
tive strategy.
Classifying Consumer Goods and Services
The classification typically used for ultimate consumers who purchase products for their 
own use and enjoyment and not for resale is based on consumer buying habits. Convenience 
products are items the consumer seeks to purchase fre-
quently, immediately, and with little effort. Items 
stocked in gas-station markets, vending machines, 
and local newsstands are usually convenience 
products—for example, newspapers, snacks, candy, 
coffee, and bread.
Shopping products are those typically purchased only 
after the buyer has compared competing products in 
competing stores. A person intent on buying a new sofa 
or dining room table may visit many stores, examine per-
haps dozens of pieces of furniture, and spend days mak-
ing the final decision. Specialty products, the third category 
of consumer products, are those that a purchaser is will-
ing to make a special effort to obtain. The purchaser is 
already familiar with the item and considers it to have no 
reasonable substitute. The nearest MINI dealer may be 
75 miles away, but if you have decided you want one, you 
will make the trip.
Note that a shopping product for one person may 
be a convenience item for someone else. Each item’s 
product classification is based on buying patterns of the 
majority of people who purchase it.
The interrelationship of the marketing mix factors is 
shown in Figure 12.1. By knowing the appropriate clas-
sification for a specific product, the marketing decision 
maker knows quite a bit about how the other mix vari-
ables will adapt to create a profitable, customer-driven 
marketing strategy.

Classifying Business Goods Business products are goods and services such as 
paycheck services and huge multifunction copying machines used in operating an organiza-
tion; they also include machinery, tools, raw materials, components, and buildings used to 
produce other items for resale. While consumer products are classified by buying habits, 
business products are classified based on how they are used and by their basic characteristics. 
Products that are long-lived and relatively expensive are called capital items. Less costly prod-
ucts that are consumed within a year are referred to as expense items.
Five basic categories of B2B products exist: installations, accessory equipment, compo-
nent parts and materials, raw materials, and supplies. Installations are major capital items, 
such as new factories, heavy equipment and machinery, and custom-made equipment. 
Installations are expensive and often involve buyer and seller negotiations that may last for 
more than a year before a purchase actually is made. Purchase approval frequently involves 
a number of different people—production specialists, representatives from the purchasing 
department, and members of top management—who must agree on the final choice.
Although accessory equipment also includes capital items, they are usually less expensive 
and shorter lived than installations and involve fewer decision makers. Examples include 
hand tools and fax machines. Component parts and materials are finished business goods that 
become part of a final product, such as disk drives that are sold to computer manufacturers 
or batteries purchased by automakers. Raw materials are farm and natural products used in 
producing other final products. Examples include milk, wood, leather, and soybeans. Supplies 
are expense items used in a firm’s daily operation that do not become part of the final prod-
uct. Often referred to as MRO (maintenance, repair, and operating supplies), they include 
paper clips, light bulbs, and copy paper.

Classifying Services Services can be classified as either B2C or B2B. Child and 
elder care centers and auto detail shops provide services for consumers, while the Pinkerton 
security patrol at a local factory and Kelly Services’ temporary office workers are examples of 
business services. In some cases, a service can accommodate both consumer and business mar-
kets. For example, when ServiceMaster cleans the upholstery in a home, it is a B2C service, but 
when it spruces up the painting system and robots in a manufacturing plant, it is a B2B service.
Like tangible goods, services can also be convenience, shopping, or specialty products 
depending on the buying patterns of customers. However, they are distinguished from goods 
in several ways. First, services, unlike goods, are intangible. In addition, they are perishable 
because firms cannot stockpile them in inventory. They are also difficult to standardize, 
because they must meet individual customers’ needs. Finally, from a buyer’s perspective, the 
service provider is the service; the two are inseparable in the buyer’s mind.
Marketing Strategy Implications
The consumer product classification system is a useful tool in marketing strategy. As 
described in Figure 12.1, because a new refrigerator is classified as a shopping good, its mar-
keters have a better idea of its promotion, pricing, and distribution needs.
Each group of business products, however, requires a different marketing strategy. 
Because most installations and many component parts are frequently marketed directly from 
manufacturer to business buyer, the promotional emphasis is on personal selling rather 
than on advertising. By contrast, marketers of supplies and accessory equipment rely more 
on advertising, because their products are often sold through an intermediary, such as a 
wholesaler. Producers of installations and component parts may involve their customers in 
new-product development, especially when the business product is custom made. Finally, 
firms selling supplies and accessory equipment place greater emphasis on competitive pricing 
strategies than do other B2B marketers, who tend to concentrate more on product quality 
and customer service.
Product Lines and Product Mix
Few firms operate with a single product. If their initial entry is successful, they tend to 
increase their profit and growth chances by adding new offerings. The iPhone and iPad, 
with their touchscreen technology and App Stores, may be harbingers of things to come. 
Although most “mainstream knowledge workers” will probably continue to use conventional 
computers for some time, one IT research company predicts that by 2015, more than half 
of personal computers bought for users aged 15 and under will have touchscreens. The firm 
also predicts that touchscreen devices have a huge potential in education—which would 
mean that an entire generation will grow up with touchscreen technology.2
A company’s product line is a group of related products marked by physical similarities 
or intended for a similar market. A product mix is the assortment of product lines and indi-
vidual goods and services that a firm offers to consumers and business users. The Coca-Cola 
Company and PepsiCo both have product lines that include old standards—Coke Classic 
and Diet Coke, Pepsi and Diet Pepsi. But recently, PepsiCo announced it would start dis-
tributing Tampico Plus in selected states. Unlike other products from Tampico Beverages, 
Tampico Plus drinks contain vitamins A, C, and E. They also have half as much sugar as 
regular Tampico drinks. Thus, they meet the guidelines for beverages that can be sold in 
U.S. high schools, which want to limit the amount of sugar in drinks available to students.3

Marketers must assess their product mix continually to ensure company 
growth, to satisfy changing consumer needs and wants, and to adjust to 
competitors’ offerings. To remain competitive, marketers look for gaps in 
their product lines and fill them with new offerings or modified versions of 
existing ones. A helpful tool that is frequently used in making product deci-
sions is the product life cycle.
Product Life Cycle
Once a product is on the market, it usually goes through four stages 
known as the product life cycle: introduction, growth, maturity, and 
decline. As Figure 12.2 shows, industry sales and profits vary depending on 
the life-cycle stage of an item.
Product life cycles are not set in stone; not all products follow this pat-
tern precisely, and different products may spend different periods of time 
in each stage. The concept, however, helps the marketing planner antici-
pate developments throughout the various stages of a product’s life. Profits 
assume a predictable pattern through the stages, and promotional emphasis 
shifts from dispensing product information in the early stages to heavy 
brand promotion in the later ones.
Stages of the Product Life Cycle
In the introduction stage, the firm tries to promote demand for its new offering; inform 
the market about it; give free samples to entice consumers to make a trial purchase; and 
explain its features, uses, and benefits. Sometimes companies partner at this stage to promote 
new products, as did General Mills and Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures to

launch Yoplait Greek Yogurt. General Mills invited women to “discover their inner god-
dess” in connection with the film companies’ Clash of the Titans. Izabella Miko, who played 
the goddess Athena in the film, was the spokesperson for the new yogurt.4 The developers of 
Crocs sandals spent the introduction stage selling their product from booths at boat shows. 
That product moved to the next stage very quickly.
New-product development costs and extensive introductory promotional campaigns to 
acquaint prospective buyers with the merits of the innovation, though essential to later suc-
cess, are expensive and commonly lead to losses in the introductory stage. Some firms are 
seeking to lower these costs through ultra-low-cost product development, which involves 
meeting customer needs with the lowest-cost innovations possible, designing from scratch 
with a stripped-down budget, and the simplest engineering possible.5 But all these expendi-
tures are necessary if the firm is to profit later.
During the growth stage, sales climb quickly as new customers join early users who now 
are repurchasing the item. Word-of-mouth referrals and continued advertising and other 
special promotions by the firm induce others to make trial purchases. At this point, the 
company begins to earn profits on the new product. This success encourages competitors to 
enter the field with similar offerings, and price competition develops. After its initial success 
with the Kindle digital reader, Amazon faced competition from the Barnes & Noble Nook 
and the Sony Reader. Amazon rushed to get its Kindle iPad app to the App Store in time for 
the debut of Apple’s iPad.6
In the maturity stage, industry sales at first increase, but they eventually reach a satura-
tion level at which further expansion is difficult. Competition also intensifies, increasing the 
availability of the product. Firms concentrate on capturing competitors’ customers, often 
dropping prices to further the appeal. Cell phones are in the maturity stage: competitors 
compete not only on price but also on features such as calendars, e-mail and attachments, 
messaging capability, full-color screens, keyboards, and fax and word-processing functions. 
Flat-screen TVs are also in the maturity stage, so companies are trying to entice consumers 
to buy new ones by offering even bigger TVs than they have before, topping the 50-inch 
mark. As worldwide production of high-definition TVs increases dramatically, some observ-
ers predict that makers of LED backlight displays will lower their prices dramatically to stay 
competitive with other, less expensive display options.7
Sales volume fades late in the maturity stage, and some of the weaker competitors leave 
the market. During this stage, firms promote mature products aggressively to protect their 
market share and to distinguish their products from those of competitors. Alberto Culver is 
changing the old tub of Noxzema—the tub itself will remain, but with a new look. Through 
a new online and print campaign, the promotion of the product is changing into a fresh, tin-
gling face cleansing experience for women.8
Sales continue to fall in the decline stage, the fourth phase of the product life cycle. 
Profits decline and may become losses as further price-cutting occurs in the reduced over-
all market for the item. Competitors gradually exit, making some profits possible for the 
remaining firms in the shrinking market. The decline stage usually is caused by a product 
innovation or a shift in consumer preferences. Sometimes technology change can hasten 
the decline stage for a product. Eighty percent of U.S. residences contain at least one DVD 
player. High-definition DVDs, once touted as the ultimate in DVD technology, have been 
superseded by Blu-ray. Online sites where consumers can simply download movies or televi-
sion shows are becoming another major competitor for entertainment as the link between 
computer and television is becoming faster and more reliable.9

Marketing Strategy Implications 
of the Product Life Cycle
Like the product classification system, the product life cycle is a useful concept for 
designing a marketing strategy that will be flexible enough to accommodate changing mar-
ketplace characteristics. These competitive moves may involve developing new products, 
lowering prices, increasing distribution coverage, creating new promotional campaigns, or 
any combination of these approaches. General Motors has decided to develop new versions 
of its Buick brand models, as the “Hit & Miss” feature explains. In general, the marketer’s 
objective is to extend the product life cycle as long as the item is profitable. Some products 
can be highly profitable during the later stages of their life cycle, because all the initial devel-
opment costs have already been recovered.
A commonly used strategy for extending the life cycle is to increase customers’ fre-
quency of use. Walmart and Meijer offer grocery sections in their stores in order to increase 
the frequency of shopper visits. Another strategy is to add new users. Marketers for Old 
Spice grooming products decided that Old Spice didn’t have to be old hat. So they came 
up with a campaign to freshen up the product line’s image and attract younger men. Called 
“The Man Your Man Could Smell Like,” it cleverly poked fun at the idea that merely using 
Old Spice would make younger men irresistible to women—while promising, with a wink, 
that it would.10
Arm & Hammer used a third approach: finding new uses for its products. The original 
use of the firm’s baking soda in baking has been augmented by its newer uses as a toothpaste,

When General Motors emerged from its financial troubles, many 
observers thought it might discontinue its Buick line. After all, the com-
pany had retired the hundred-year-old Oldsmobile several years ago. 
Once known as the “doctor’s car” or the “banker’s car,” Buick gradu-
ally lost its prestige and became known for its older car buyers. But GM 
decided to regenerate the 106-year-old brand—with some success.
GM’s strategy has been to aim at younger, upscale customers by 
offering only a few Buick models at first, but equipping them with the 
latest techology, from its OnStar system to DVD players, navigation 
systems, and the latest safety features. The Enclave, a large crossover 
vehicle, is popular with buyers about 55 years old; half of the buyers 
are women. The 2011 Buick Regal sedan is intended to compete with 
the Acura TSX and the Infiniti G37. Leather upholstery is standard, 
as are other luxury features. Designers of the revised LaCrosse sedan 
made sure the backseat has generous headroom and legroom. Buicks 
have always been popular in China, and GM hopes that the new 
LaCrosse will appeal to Chinese executives, who travel in chauffeur-
driven cars. Many higher-income American buyers are trading in 
imports for the LaCrosse. By 2012, Buick plans to introduce two more 
models.
How successful has Buick’s strategy been? It may be too soon to 
tell for sure. The average age of Buick buyers overall has fallen from 70 
to 65. Buick sold more than 102,000 vehicles most recently, but 
that was fewer than the previous year and only about one-fourth as 
many as earlier in the decade. But Craig Bierly, Buick’s product 
marketing director, says, “You have to change the product before you 
can change opinion. It’s still too soon to really come to a verdict. . . . 
But nobody can say those are old person’s cars anymore. Because 
they aren’t.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What stage of its life cycle do you think the Buick brand 
has reached? How did General Motors extend Buick’s life 
cycle?
2. How are Buick’s new features part of General Motors’ 
strategy for these cars?

refrigerator freshener, and flame extinguisher. A fourth product life cycle extension strategy is 
changing package sizes, labels, and product designs. Many times, changing the product design 
means finding a way to give it an online application. To bolster its doll sales, which had 
declined almost 20 percent, the toymaker Mattel did this by teaming its iconic Barbie doll 
with the White House Project and the Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Foundation. 
Consumers were invited to celebrate Barbie’s 125th career by voting online to choose from 
among architect, computer engineer, environmentalist, news anchor, and surgeon. The win-
ners, announced at the recent New York Toy Fair, were Computer Engineer Barbie (by 
popular vote) and News Anchor Barbie (by girls’ vote). Both were part of Barbie’s “I Can 
Be” series.11
Stages in New-Product Development
New-product development is expensive, time consuming, and risky, because only about 
one-third of new products become success stories. Products can fail for many reasons. Some 
are not properly developed and tested, some are poorly packaged, and others lack adequate 
promotional support or distribution or do not satisfy a consumer need or want. Even suc-
cessful products eventually reach the end of the decline stage and must be replaced with 
new-product offerings.
Most of today’s newly developed items are aimed 
at satisfying specific consumer demands. New-product 
development is becoming increasingly efficient and cost-
effective because marketers use a systematic approach in 
developing new products. As Figure 12.3 shows, the new-
product development process has six stages. Each stage 
requires a “go/no-go” decision by management before 
moving on to subsequent stages. Because items that go 
through each development stage only to be rejected at one 
of the final stages involve significant investments in both 
time and money, the sooner decision makers can identify a 
marginal product and drop it from further consideration, 
the less time and money will be wasted.
The starting point in the new-product development 
process is generating ideas for new offerings. Ideas come 
from many sources, including customer suggestions, sup-
pliers, employees, research scientists, marketing research, 
inventors outside the firm, and competitive products. 
The most successful ideas are directly related to satisfy-
ing customer needs. Procter & Gamble recently expanded 
its Febreze home collection with the Flameless Luminary 
In-Home Scent Delivery System. Instead of a potentially 
dangerous candle, a battery-operated, flameless light diffuses 
fragrance from a decorative, scented shade. The light auto-
matically turns off after four hours. The design was a finalist 
in the Consumer Packaged Goods—Household Segment 
category of the Edison Best New Product Awards.12
In the second stage, screening eliminates ideas that do 
not mesh with overall company objectives or that cannot 
be developed given the company’s resources. Some firms

hold open discussions of new-product ideas with specialists who work in different functional 
areas in the organization.
During the concept development and business analysis phase, further screening occurs. 
The analysis involves assessing the new product’s potential sales, profits, growth rate, and 
competitive strengths and determining whether it fits with the company’s product, distri-
bution, and promotional resources. Concept testing—marketing research designed to solicit 
initial consumer reaction to new-product ideas—may be used at this stage. For example, 
potential consumers might be asked about proposed brand names and other methods of 
product identification. Focus groups are formal sessions in which consumers meet with mar-
keters to discuss what they like or dislike about current products and perhaps test or sample 
a new offering to provide some immediate feedback.
Next, an actual product is developed, subjected to a series of tests, and revised. 
Functioning prototypes or detailed descriptions of the product may be created. These 
designs are the joint responsibility of the firm’s development staff and its marketers, who 
provide feedback on consumer reactions to the proposed product design, color, and other 
physical features. Sometimes prototypes do not meet the stated requirements. The U.S. 
Marine Corps’ infantry combat equipment program recently asked four companies to 
develop a new plastic helmet that would be lighter and more durable than the current Kevlar 
headgear. The Marine Corps and the Army both required the new helmets to be 35 percent 
more effective against fragmentation as well as handgun and small-arms bullets. However, 
all four prototypes failed either to stop bullets or to stand up against blunt force, or both, so 
more work was necessary to meet the government’s requirements.13
Test marketing introduces a new product supported by a complete marketing campaign 
to a selected city or TV coverage area. Marketers look for a location or television coverage 
area with a manageable size, where residents match their target market’s demographic pro-
file, to test their product. During the test marketing stage, the item is sold in a limited area 
while the company examines both consumer responses to the new offering and the market-
ing effort used to support it. Test market results can help managers determine the product’s 
likely performance in a full-scale introduction. Some firms skip test marketing, however, 
because of concerns that the test could reveal their product strategies to the competition. 
Also, the expense of doing limited production runs of complex products such as a new auto 
or refrigerator is sometimes so high that the test marketing stage is skipped and the develop-
ment process moves directly to the next stage.
In the final stage, commercialization, the product is made available in the marketplace. 
Sometimes this stage is referred to as a product launch. Considerable planning goes into this 
stage, because the firm’s distribution, promotion, and pricing strategies must all be geared to 
support the new product offering. The videogame maker Electronic Arts (EA) announced a 
new distribution strategy for future games. EA will release premium downloadable content 
(PLDC) for a game before releasing the complete, packaged version. The PLDC will be 
priced at $15 and will include three to four hours of playing time. The company will invite 
comments from reviewers and players and make changes to the final version prior to release.14
The need for a steady stream of new products to offer the firm’s customers, the chances 
of product failure, and the tens of millions of dollars needed to complete a successful new-
product launch make new-product development a vital process for 21st-century firms. 
However, as Table 12.1 illustrates, success is not guaranteed until the new-product offer-
ing achieves customer acceptance. Microsoft introduced a new operating system, Windows 
Vista, but it just never caught on. The next version of Windows, Windows 7, has fared 
better. A computer device was supposed to bring the sense of smell to online shopping or 
browsing. But the company, DigiScent, didn’t think through its plan carefully. Aside from

Product Identiﬁ cation
A major aspect of developing a successful new product involves methods used for iden-
tifying a product and distinguishing it from competing offerings. Both tangible goods and 
intangible services are identified by brands, brand names, and trademarks. A brand is a 
name, term, sign, symbol, design, or some combination that identifies the products of one 
firm and differentiates them from competitors’ offerings. Tropicana, Pepsi, and Gatorade are 
all made by PepsiCo, but a unique combination of name, symbol, and package design distin-
guishes each brand from the others.
A brand name is that part of the brand consisting of words or letters included in a 
name used to identify and distinguish the firm’s offerings from those of competitors. The 
brand name is the part of the brand that can be vocalized. Many brand names, such as Coca-
Cola, McDonald’s, American Express, Google, and Nike, are famous around the world. 
Likewise, the “golden arches” brand mark of McDonald’s also is widely recognized.
A trademark is a brand that has been given legal protection. The protection is granted 
solely to the brand’s owner. Trademark protection includes not only the brand name but 
also design logos, slogans, packaging elements, and product features such as color and shape. 
A well-designed trademark, such as the Nike “swoosh,” can make a difference in how posi-
tively consumers perceive a brand.
Selecting an Effective Brand Name
Good brands are easy to pronounce, recognize, and remember: Crest, Visa, and Dell are 
examples. Global firms face a real problem in selecting brand names, because an excellent 
brand name in one country may prove disastrous in another. Most languages have a short 
a, so Coca-Cola is pronounceable almost anywhere. But an advertising campaign for E-Z

washing machines failed in the United Kingdom because the British pro-

Brand names should also convey the right image to the buyer. One 
effective technique is to create a name that links the product with its 
positioning strategy. The name Dial reinforces the concept of 24-hour 
protection; Dove soap and beauty products give an impression of mild-
ness, and Taster’s Choice instant coffee supports the promotional claim 
“Tastes and smells like ground roast coffee.”
Brand names also must be legally protectable. Trademark law speci-
fies that brand names cannot contain words in general use, such as 
television or automobile. Generic words—words that describe a type of 
product—cannot be used exclusively by any organization. On the other 
hand, if a brand name becomes so popular that it passes into common 
language and turns into a generic word, the company can no longer use 
it as a brand name. Once upon a time, aspirin, linoleum, and zipper were 
exclusive brand names, but today they have become generic terms and are 
no longer legally protectable.
Brand Categories
A brand offered and promoted by a manufacturer is known as a 
manufacturer’s (or national) brand. Examples are Tide, Cheerios, Windex, 
Fossil, and Nike. But not all brand names belong to manufacturers; some 
are the property of retailers or distributors. A private (or store) brand iden-
tifies a product that is not linked to the manufacturer but instead carries a wholesaler’s or 
retailer’s label. Sears’s Craftsman tools and Walmart’s Ol’ Roy dog food are examples.
Another branding decision marketers must make is whether to use a family brand-
ing strategy or an individual branding strategy. A family brand is a single brand name used 
for several related products. KitchenAid, Johnson & Johnson, Hewlett-Packard, and Arm 
& Hammer use a family name for their entire line of products. When a firm using fam-
ily branding introduces a new product, both customers and retailers recognize the familiar 
brand name. The promotion of individual products within a line benefits all the products 
because the family brand is well known.
Other firms use an individual branding strategy by giving each product within a line a 
different name. For example, Procter & Gamble has individual brand names for its different 
laundry detergents, including Tide, Cheer, and Dash. Each brand targets a unique market 
segment. Consumers who want a cold-water detergent can choose Cheer over Tide or Dash, 
instead of purchasing a competitor’s brand. Individual branding also builds competition 
within a firm and enables the company to increase overall sales.
Brand Loyalty and Brand Equity
Brands achieve varying consumer familiarity and acceptance. While a homeowner may 
insist on Anderson windows when renovating, the consumer buying a loaf of bread may not 
prefer any brand. Consumer loyalty increases a brand’s value, so marketers try to strengthen 
brand loyalty. When a brand image suffers, marketers try to recreate a positive image.
Brand Loyalty Marketers measure brand loyalty in three stages: brand recognition, 
brand preference, and brand insistence. Brand recognition is brand acceptance strong enough

that the consumer is aware of the brand, but not strong 
enough to cause a preference over other brands. A con-
sumer might have heard of L’Oréal hair care products, 
for instance, without necessarily preferring them to 
Redken. Advertising, free samples, and discount cou-
pons are among the most common ways to increase 
brand recognition.
Brand preference occurs when a consumer chooses 
one firm’s brand over a competitor’s. At this stage, 
the consumer usually relies on previous experience 
in selecting the product. Furniture and other home 
furnishings fall into this category. A shopper who pur-
chased an IKEA dining room table and chairs and was 
satisfied with them is likely to return to purchase a bed-
room set. While there, this shopper might pick up a set 
of mixing bowls for the kitchen or a lamp for the 
family room—because he or she knows and likes the 
IKEA brand.
Brand insistence is the ultimate degree of brand loy-
alty, in which the consumer will look for it at another 
outlet, special-order it from a dealer, order by mail, 
or search the Internet. Shoppers who insist on IKEA 
products for their homes may drive an hour or two—
making a day excursion of the venture—to visit an 
IKEA store. The combination of value for the money 
and the concept of IKEA as a shopping destination 
have given the brand a unique allure for shoppers.16
Brand-building strategies were once limited to 
the consumer realm, but now they are becoming more 
important for B2B brands as well. Intel, Xerox, IBM, 
and service providers such as Krystal Klean and Cisco 
are among the suppliers who have built brand names 
among business customers.
Brand Equity Brand loyalty is at the heart of 
brand equity, the added value that a respected and 
successful name gives to a product. This value results 
from a combination of factors, including awareness, 
loyalty, and perceived quality, as well as any feelings or 
images the customer associates with the brand. High 
brand equity offers financial advantages to a firm, 
because the product commands a relatively large market 
share and sometimes reduces price sensitivity, generat-
ing higher profits. Figure 12.4 shows the world’s ten 
most valuable brands and their estimated worth.
Brand awareness means the product is the first one that comes to mind when a product 
category is mentioned. If someone says “coffee,” do you think of Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, 
or Folgers? Brand association is the link between a brand and other favorable images. A 
recent survey of small- and midsize-business owners and executives by American City

value that a respected and 
successful name gives to a 
product.

Large companies have typically assigned the task of managing a brand’s marketing strat-
egies to a brand manager, who may also be called a product manager at some firms. This mar-
keting professional plans and implements the balance of promotional, pricing, distribution, 
and product arrangements that leads to strong brand equity. A category manager, a newer 
type of professional, oversees an entire group of products. Unlike traditional brand or prod-
uct managers, category managers have profit responsibility for their product group. These 
managers are assisted by associates, usually called analysts. Part of the shift to category man-
agement was initiated by large retailers, when they realized there could be a benefit from the 
marketing muscle of large grocery and household goods producers such as Kraft and Procter 
& Gamble. As a result, producers began to focus their attention on in-store merchandising 
instead of mass-market advertising. A few years ago, Kraft reorganized its sales force so that 
each representative was responsible for a retailer’s needs instead of pushing a single brand.
A category advisor functions in the B2B context. This vendor is the major supplier 
designated by a business customer to assume responsibility for dealing with all the other ven-
dors for a project and presenting the entire package to the business buyer.
Packages and Labels
Packaging and labels are important in product identification. They also play an impor-
tant role in a firm’s overall product strategy. Packaging affects the durability, image, and 
convenience of an item and is responsible for one of the biggest costs in many consumer 
products. Due to a growing demand to produce smaller, more environmentally friendly 
packages, box manufacturers and chemical compa-
nies are now working harder to create more com-
pact packaging that is made from renewable sources 
and is recyclable. Frito-Lay recently introduced 
compostable packaging for its SunChips multi-
grain snacks, as the “Hit & Miss” feature explains. 
One-third of America’s waste consists of containers 
and packaging, much of it from fast-food chains. 
Quiznos recently launched its “Eat Toasty, Be 
Green” campaign, which introduced new, environ-
mentally friendly packaging. Among the changes 
to reduce the chain’s environmental impact are 100 
percent compostable, wax-coated paper cups; salad 
containers made of renewable sugarcane; napkins 
made from 100 percent recycled materials; and plas-
tic lids made from 30 percent recycled PET bottles. 
Even the employees’ uniforms are being changed, 
with hats and aprons made from 100 percent recy-
cled soda bottles.18
Choosing the right package is especially crucial 
in international marketing because marketers must 
be aware of such factors as language variations and 
cultural preferences. Consumers in African nations 
often prefer bold colors, but use of the country’s 
flag colors may be problematic. Some countries

Everybody loves to snack on chips, but surely nobody can love 
what happens to the empty bag, which eventually ends up in a land-
fill—and may never decompose. Frito-Lay’s brand SunChips aimed to 
change that when it introduced what it called “the world’s first com-
postable chip bag” on Earth Day.
In a recent survey, 75 percent of those questioned thought that 
recyclable packaging was “somewhat important”; 51 percent felt that 
compostable packaging was “somewhat important.” A recyclable item 
can be used repeatedly, whereas a compostable item breaks down in 
the presence of water and oxygen.
The company had to meet the challenge of developing packaging 
that was ecologically sound while preserving the contents. After four 
years of research and testing, the company had a bag made of more 
than 90 percent plant-based, and therefore renewable, materials. The 
outer layer is made of corn-based polylactic acid (PLA). Although the 
bag is 100 percent compostable, researchers are currently developing an 
environmentally friendly inner layer that will keep the contents crisp and 
edible. Frito-Lay makes it clear that the bag decomposes most quickly—
in about 14 weeks—in a hot, active composting bin. If the bag is simply 
left on the ground, it will still break down, but less efficiently.
While assuring its customers that SunChips will still taste the 
same, Frito-Lay is marketing the fact that because of the different 
material, the new bag sounds somewhat different from conventional 
packaging. It is promoting the difference as the “new sound of green” 
and even has a clip of the sound on its Web site, along with a link to 
Facebook.
The Biodegradable Products Institute has certified the new 
packaging, but getting Americans to recognize the importance of 
composting is another matter. A Frito-Lay executive acknowledged 
the challenge—and the opportunity to educate consumers.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What role does the new, compostable packaging play in 
the overall marketing strategy for SunChips?
2. How do you think SunChips can most effectively educate 
Americans about the importance of composting?

frown on other uses of their flag. Also, in Africa red is often associated with death or witch-
craft. Package size can vary according to the purchasing patterns and market conditions of a 
country. In countries with small refrigerators, people may want to buy their beverages one at 
a time rather than in six-packs. Package weight is another important issue, because shipping 
costs are often based on weight.
Labeling is an integral part of the packaging process as well. In the United States, label-
ing must meet federal laws requiring companies to provide enough information to allow 
consumers to make value comparisons among competitive products and, in the case of food 
packaging, provide nutrition information on the label. Marketers who ship products to other 
countries have to comply with labeling requirements in those nations. This means knowing 
the answers to such questions as the following:
 
• Should the labels be in more than one language?
 • Should ingredients be specified?
 • Do the labels give enough information about the product to meet government stan-
dards?
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a statement by its commis-
sioner, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, that encouraged food companies to ensure that their label-
ing complied with FDA regulations, and that the labeling was accurate and did not mislead 
the public. In the following year, the FDA informed 17 food companies that the labeling of

almost two dozen of their products violated the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Among the 
violations were unauthorized health claims, unauthorized nutrient content claims, and unau-
thorized use of such terms as “healthy” and others that have strict regulatory definitions. In 
an open letter to the food industry, Dr. Hamburg stated, “Today, ready access to reliable 
information about the calorie and nutrient content of food is even more important, given the 
prevalence of obesity and diet-related diseases in the United States.”19
Another important aspect of packaging and labeling is the universal product code (UPC), 
the bar code read by optical scanners that print the name of the item and the price on a 
receipt. For many stores, these identifiers are useful not just for packaging and labeling but 
also for simplifying and speeding retail transactions and for evaluating customer purchases 
and controlling inventory. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology—embed-
ded chips that can broadcast their product information to receivers—may replace UPC bar 
codes, however, as we’ll discuss later in this chapter.
Distribution Strategy
The next element of the marketing mix, distribution strategy, deals with the mar-
keting activities and institutions involved in getting the right good or service to the firm’s 
customers. Distribution decisions involve modes of transportation, warehousing, inventory 
control, order processing, and selection of marketing channels. Marketing channels typically 
are made up of intermediaries such as retailers and wholesalers that move a product from 
producer to final purchaser.
The two major components of an organization’s distribution strategy are distribution 
channels and physical distribution. Distribution channels are the paths that products—and 
legal ownership of them—follow from producer to consumer or business user. They are the 
means by which all organizations distribute their goods and services. Physical distribution 
is the actual movement of products from producer to consumers or business users. Physical 
distribution covers a broad range of activities, including customer service, transportation, 
inventory control, materials handling, order processing, and warehousing. As explained in 
the “Going Green” feature, Testa Produce, a food distributor, is building a new “green” 
facility to house its headquarters and its produce-distribution facility.
Distribution Channels
In their first decision for distribution channel selection, marketers choose which type of 
channel will best meet both their firm’s marketing objectives and the needs of their custom-
ers. As shown in Figure 12.5, marketers can choose either a direct distribution channel, which 
carries goods directly from producer to consumer or business user, or distribution channels 
that involve several different marketing intermediaries. A marketing intermediary (also called 
a middleman) is a business firm that moves goods between producers and consumers or busi-
ness users. Marketing intermediaries perform various functions that help the distribution 
channel operate smoothly, such as buying, selling, storing, and transporting products; sort-
ing and grading bulky items; and providing information to other channel members. The two 
main categories of marketing intermediaries are wholesalers and retailers.
No one channel suits every product. The best choice depends on the circumstances of 
the market and on customer needs. The most appropriate channel choice may also change 
over time as new opportunities arise and marketers strive to maintain their competitiveness.

Testa Produce Sells—and Builds—Green
Since 1912, when Dominick Testa began selling fruits and vegeta-
bles door to door, Testa Produce Inc. has grown to become the Chicago 
area’s premier independent produce distributor. The current generation 
is making changes that Dominick could not have imagined. Ground was 
broken for a new company headquarters and warehouse. Testa Produce 
anticipated having the first food-distribution facility with the Leadership 
for Energy and Environmental Development (LEED) Platinum certifica-
tion—the highest granted to a “green” building by the U.S. Green 
Building Council.
At $20 million, the new space cost 20 percent more and will have 
a longer return on investment than a conventional design. But Peter 
Testa, the company president, said, “[W]e . . . committed from the start 
to raising the bar on sustainability in our industry, which has a fairly 
large carbon footprint.”
Testa Produce’s new headquarters is equipped with the most 
advanced sustainable technological features, with room for future 
expansion and further advances in green technology.
A 245-foot-tall wind turbine and solar panels generate half of the 
building’s power. Solar collectors heat water for all sinks, showers, 
and sanitary facilities. Skylights provide natural, ambient lighting, and 
a solar tracking system adjusts the ambient light over the course of the 
day.
The roof is about 50 percent vegetated to prevent rain runoff and 
slopes down to form a dramatic green wall at the building’s entrance. 
An internal filtered cistern and a retention pond outside capture rain-
water and recycle it for nondrinking purposes. Permeable paving mate-
rials on walkways and in parking areas allow rainwater to drain into 
live wetlands. The landscaping features native plants that don’t need 
constant irrigation. Watering should be necessary only during severe 
droughts.
Five thousand sites around the world are now LEED certified, but 
only 5 percent of those have won the coveted Platinum certification.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. As a distributor, Testa Produce doesn’t have direct contact 
with the public. How might the company go about alert-
ing consumers to its “green” initiatives?
2. What are some ways that Testa Produce might encourage 
its employees to follow “green” practices?

Currently, most smart phones sold in the United States are tied to a single wireless carrier 
that controls all distribution of its particular phone. Consumers can choose a smart phone 
but can’t choose a carrier. Recently, Google announced the release of its Nexus One smart 
phone, for sale at a new, Google-hosted Web store. The Nexus One offers some new fea-
tures, but Google’s long-range goal is to change the distribution channels for smart phones. 
Buyers have the option of buying a conventional version of the Nexus One that is locked to 
T-Mobile’s service plan and therefore controlled by T-Mobile, or an unlocked version—that 
is, one that can be used with any wireless service plan. By offering an unlocked smart phone, 
Google is gambling that consumers will choose a distribution channel that isn’t tied to a 
wireless carrier and that Google itself will be able to create software that can compete with 
that available for the iPhone. In this type of business model, buyers would be able to select 
a phone first and then sign up with a carrier, much as they can now buy any brand of com-
puter regardless of their Internet service provider.20
Direct Distribution The shortest and simplest means of connecting producers 
and customers is direct contact between the two parties. This approach is most common in 
the B2B market. Consumers who buy fresh fruits and vegetables at rural roadside stands or 
farmers markets use direct distribution, as do services ranging from banking and ten-minute 
oil changes to ear piercing and Mary Kay Cosmetics.
Direct distribution is commonly found in the marketing of relatively expensive, complex 
products that may require demonstrations. Most major B2B products such as installations, 

Part 4  Marketing Management
404
accessory equipment, component parts, business services, and even raw materials are typi-
cally marketed through direct contacts between producers and business buyers. The Internet 
has also made direct distribution an attractive option for many retail companies and service 
providers. FedEx customers have long used online tools to track conventional shipments. 
Fedex’s new International Priority Direct Distribution service allows users to ship more than 
one package from a single country of origin to a different recipients in single destination 
country. The packages are cleared through customs as a single shipment. In addition, mul-
tiple shipments to multiple recipients in multiple European Union countries can be cleared 
through customs as a single shipment through Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris.21
Distribution Channels Using Marketing Intermediaries Although 
direct channels allow simple and straightforward connections between producers and their 
customers, the list of channel alternatives in Figure 12.5 suggests that direct distribution is 
not the best choice in every instance. Some products sell in small quantities for relatively 
low prices to thousands of widely scattered consumers. Makers of such products cannot cost 
effectively contact each of their customers, so they distribute products through specialized 
intermediaries called wholesalers and retailers.
Although you might think that adding intermediaries to the distribution process would 
increase the final cost of products, more often than not this choice actually lowers consumer 
prices. Intermediaries such as wholesalers and retailers often add significant value to a prod-
uct as it moves through the distribution channel. They do so by creating utility, providing 
additional services, and reducing costs.

Marketing utility is created when intermediaries help ensure that products are available 
for sale when and where customers want to purchase them. If you want something warm to 
eat on a cold winter night, you don’t call up Campbell’s Soup and ask them to ship a can of 
chicken noodle soup. Instead, you go to the nearest grocery store, where you find utility in 
the form of product availability. In addition, intermediaries perform such important services 
as transporting merchandise to convenient locations. Finally, by representing numerous 
producers, a marketing intermediary can cut the costs of buying and selling. As Figure 12.6 
shows, if four manufacturers each sold directly to four consumers, this would require 16

separate transactions. Adding a marketing intermediary, such as a retailer, to the exchange 
cuts the number of necessary transactions to 8.
Wholesaling
A wholesaler is a distribution channel member that sells primarily to retailers, other 
wholesalers, or business users. For instance, Sysco is a wholesaler that buys food products 
from producers and then resells them to restaurants, hotels, and other institutions in the 
United States and Canada.
Wholesaling is a crucial part of the distribution channel for many products, particularly 
consumer goods and business supplies. Wholesaling intermediaries can be classified on the 
basis of ownership; some are owned by manufacturers, some are owned by retailers, and oth-
ers are independently owned. The United States has about 430,000 wholesalers, 85 percent 
of which have fewer than 20 employees.22
Manufacturer-Owned Wholesaling Intermediaries
A manufacturer’s marketing manager may decide to distribute goods directly through 
company-owned facilities to control distribution or customer service. Firms operate two main 
types of manufacturer-owned wholesaling intermediaries: sales branches and sales offices.
Sales branches stock the products they distribute and fill orders from their inventories. 
They also provide offices for sales representatives. Sales branches are common in the chemi-
cal, petroleum products, motor vehicle, and machine and equipment industries.
A sales office is exactly what its name implies: an office for a producer’s salespeople. 
Manufacturers set up sales offices in various regions to support local selling efforts and 
improve customer service. Some kitchen and bath fixture manufacturers maintain show-
rooms to display their products. Builders and decorators can visit these showrooms to see 
how the items would look in place. Unlike sales branches, however, sales offices do not store 
any inventory. When a customer orders from a showroom or other sales office, the mer-
chandise is delivered from a separate warehouse.
Independent Wholesaling Intermediaries
An independent wholesaling intermediary is a business that represents a number of dif-
ferent manufacturers and makes sales calls on retailers, manufacturers, and other business 
accounts. Independent wholesalers are classified as either merchant wholesalers or agents 
and brokers, depending on whether they take title to the products they handle.
Merchant wholesalers, like apparel wholesaler WholesaleSarong.com, are independently 
owned wholesaling intermediaries that take title to the goods they handle. Within this 
category, a full-function merchant wholesaler provides a complete assortment of services for 
retailers or industrial buyers, such as warehousing, shipping, and even financing. A subtype 
of full-function merchant is a rack jobber, such as Ohio-based Arrow Distributing, which han-
dles distribution of CDs and DVDs to retail stores. This type of firm stocks, displays, and

A limited-function merchant wholesaler also takes legal title to the products it handles, but 
it provides fewer services to the retailers to which it sells. Some limited-function merchant 
wholesalers only warehouse products but do not offer delivery service. Others warehouse and 
deliver products but provide no financing. One type of limited-function merchant wholesaler 
is a drop shipper such as Kate Aspen, an Atlanta-based wholesaler of wedding favors. Drop ship-
pers also operate in such industries as coal and lumber, characterized by bulky products for 
which no single producer can provide a complete assortment. They give access to many related 
goods by contacting numerous producers and negotiating the best possible prices. Cost consid-
erations call for producers to ship such products directly to the drop shipper’s customers.
Another category of independent wholesaling intermediaries consists of agents and 
brokers. They may or may not take possession of the goods they handle, but they never take 
title, working mainly to bring buyers and sellers together. Stockbrokers such as Charles 
Schwab and real estate agents such as RE/MAX perform functions similar to those of agents 
and brokers, but at the retail level. They do not take title to the sellers’ property; instead, they 
create time and ownership utility for both buyer and seller by helping carry out transactions.
Manufacturers’ reps act as independent sales forces by representing the manufacturers of 
related but noncompeting products. These agent intermediaries, sometimes referred to as 
manufacturers’ agents, receive commissions based on a percentage of the sales they make.
Retailer-Owned Cooperatives and Buying Offices
Retailers sometimes band together to form their own wholesaling organizations. Such 
organizations can take the form of either a buying group or a cooperative. The participating 
retailers set up the new operation to reduce costs or to provide some special service that is 
not readily available in the marketplace. To achieve cost savings through quantity purchases, 
independent retailers may form a buying group that negotiates bulk sales with manufactur-
ers. One such buying group is Florida-based Retail Advantage Group, which buys products 
for its member hospital gift shops and gift shop chains. Members join for a year at a time 
and can receive up to 10 percent discounts on orders they place, while remaining free to buy 
from any other vendors.23 In a cooperative, an independent group of retailers may decide to 
band together to share functions such as shipping or warehousing.
Retailing
Retailers, in contrast to wholesalers, are distribution channel members that sell goods 
and services to individuals for their own use rather than for resale. Consumers usually buy 
their food, clothing, shampoo, furniture, and appliances from some type of retailer. The 
supermarket where you buy your groceries may have bought some of its items from a whole-
saler such as Unified Grocers and then resold them to you.
Retailers are the final link—the so-called last three feet—of the distribution channel. 
Because they are often the only channel members that deal directly with consumers, it is 
essential that retailers remain alert to changing shopper needs. For instance, soaring gas 
prices affect consumers’ budgets, so they may make fewer trips to the mall or cut back on 
nonessential purchases. As a result, retailers may need to offer special sales or events to lure 
customers to their shops. It is also important for retailers to keep pace with developments in 
the fast-changing business environment, such as the disruption in delivery of supplies from 
widespread wildfires or storms.

Nonstore Retailers
Two categories of retailers exist: store and nonstore. 
As Figure 12.7 shows, nonstore retailing includes four 
forms: direct-response retailing, Internet retailing, auto-
matic merchandising, and direct selling. Direct-response 
retailing reaches prospective customers through catalogs; 
telemarketing; and even magazine, newspaper, and televi-
sion ads. Shoppers order merchandise by mail, telephone, 
computer, and fax machine and then receive home deliv-
ery or pick the merchandise up at a local store. Lands’ 
End has long stood out as a highly successful direct-
response retailer; its well-known clothing catalog and 
stellar customer service have set the standard for this 
type of distribution channel. With the retailer’s purchase 
by Sears, however, customers can now see, feel, and try 
on its clothing at Lands’ End Shops in Sears locations 
around the country.
Internet retailing, the second form of nonstore retail-
ing, has grown rapidly. Tens of thousands of retailers 
have set up shop online, with sales growing at a rate of 
about 5 percent a year (as compared with declines in 
total retail sales). Today, online sales account for about 
3.8 percent of total retail sales.24 A severe shakeout saw 
hundreds of Internet enterprises shut down during the 
first few years of the 21st century, but firms that survived 
have stronger business models than those that failed. 
Two examples of successful pure dot-coms are Amazon 
and eBay. A major shift in retailing has seen traditional 
brick-and-mortar retailers competing with pure dot-com 
start-ups by setting up their own Web sites as an option 
for shoppers. Nordstrom, JCPenney, and Walmart 
report strong online sales. Shopping sites are among the 
most popular Internet destinations, and sales of clothing 
and DVDs in particular have risen.
The last two forms of nonstore retailing are auto-
matic merchandising and direct selling. Automatic 
merchandising provides convenience through the use of 
vending machines. ATMs may soon join the ranks of 
vending machines as banks find new ways to compete 
for customers. Some ATMs offer extra services such as 
check cashing and stamps, as well as concert tickets and 
road maps. Future ATMs will be able to connect wire-
lessly to cell phones to allow customers to download and 
pay for games and music. Direct selling includes direct-to-
consumer sales by Pampered Chef kitchen representa-
tives and salespeople for Silpada sterling silver jewelry 
through party-plan selling methods. Both are forms of 
direct selling.

Companies that previously relied heavily on telemarketing in generating new customers 
have encountered consumer resistance to intrusive phone calls. Among the growing barriers 
are caller ID, call-blocking devices such as the TeleZapper, and the National Do Not Call 
list, which made it illegal for most companies to call people who are registered. As a result, 
dozens of companies, including telecommunications and regional utilities, have sent direct-
mail pieces to promote such services as phones, cable television, and natural gas distributors.
Store Retailers
In-store sales still outpace nonstore retailing methods like direct-response retailing and 
Internet selling. Store retailers range in size from tiny newsstands to multistory department 
stores and multiacre warehouselike retailers such as Sam’s Club. Table 12.2 lists the different 
types of store retailers, with examples of each type. Clearly, there are many approaches to 
retailing and a variety of services, prices, and product lines offered by each retail outlet.
The Wheel of Retailing Retailers are subject to constant change as new stores 
replace older establishments. In a process called the wheel of retailing, new retailers enter the 
market by offering lower prices made possible through reductions in service. Supermarkets 
and discount houses, for example, gained their initial market footholds through low-price,

limited-service appeals. These new entries gradually add 
services as they grow and ultimately become targets for new 
retailers.
As Figure 12.8 shows, most major developments in 
retailing appear to fit the wheel pattern. The low-price, 
limited-service strategy characterized supermarkets, catalog 
retailers, discount stores, and, most recently, Internet retail-
ers and giant “big-box” stores, such as PetSmart, Borders, 
and Office Depot. Corner grocery stores gave way to super-
markets and then to warehouse clubs such as Costco or BJ’s. 
Department stores lost market share to discount clothing 
retailers such as Target and Marshalls. Independent book-
stores have lost business to giant chains like Barnes & Noble, 
Borders, and such online-only sellers as Amazon.com and 
Buy.com.
Even though the wheel of retailing does not fit every 
pattern of retail evolution—for example, automatic merchan-
dising has always been a relatively high-priced method of 
retailing—it does give retail managers a general idea of what 
is likely to occur during the evolution of retailing. It also 
shows that business success involves the “survival of the fit-
test.” Retailers that fail to change fail to survive.
How Retailers Compete
Retailers compete with each other in many ways. Nonstore retailers focus on making 
the shopping experience as convenient as possible. Shoppers at stores such as Saks Fifth 
Avenue enjoy a luxurious atmosphere and personal service. In fact, those who visit the new 
shoe department at the flagship store in New York have the run of the entire eighth floor, 
which is entirely devoted to shoes—with its own Zip code. Saks recently began a new cam-
paign called “Special Delivery to 10022-SHOE” to introduce shoes by new designers. Some 
of the shoes are exclusive to Saks. According to Cody Kondo, Saks senior vice president and 
general merchandising manager, “With Special Delivery, the team [of buyers] selected those 
styles that were unlike anything else being shown . . . those shoes that the merchants fell in 
love with.”25
Like manufacturers, retailers must develop marketing strategies based on goals and 
strategic plans. Successful retailers convey images that alert consumers to the stores’ identi-
ties and the shopping experiences they provide. To create that image, all components of a 
retailer’s strategy must complement each other. After identifying their target markets, retail-
ers must choose merchandising, customer service, pricing, and location strategies that will 
attract customers in those market segments.
Identifying a Target Market The first step in developing a competitive 
retailing strategy is to select a target market. This choice requires careful evaluation of the 
size and profit potential of the chosen market segment and the current level of competition 
for the segment’s business. Bargain stores such as Family Dollar target consumers who are 
extremely price conscious, for example, while convenience stores like 7-Eleven target con-
sumers who want an easy way to purchase items they buy frequently. Seventh Generation, 
which makes “green” home- and personal-care items, began as a mail-order company, then

started selling at natural-food stores, then grew into a 
major business whose products are featured at supermar-
kets nationwide as well as at Target and at Amazon.com. 
Seventh Generation, which is committed to increasing 
consumer awareness of environmentally safe cleaning and 
household products, recently began its “Protecting Planet 
Home” campaign. The company plans to build on its 45 
percent profits by launching its first national marketing 
campaign online, in print, and in TV commercials. The 
company’s goal is to get 45 percent of American house-
holds to try at least one Seventh Generation product.26
Selecting a Product Strategy Next, the 
retailer must develop a product strategy to determine the 
best mix of merchandise to carry to satisfy that market. 
Retail strategists must decide on the general product cat-
egories, product lines, and variety to offer. Sometimes 
that involves expanding the product mix and sometime it 
involves contracting it. Polaroid’s parent company signed 
a five-year licensing agreement with Starlight, a leading 
consumer electronics manufacturer and distributer. Under 
the agreement, Starlight will develop a range of Polaroid-brand consumer electronics equip-
ment, including Blu-ray players, stand-alone and portable DVD players, e-readers, iPod 
docking stations, and home theater systems.27
Shaping a Customer Service Strategy A retailer’s customer service strat-
egy focuses on attracting and retaining target customers to maximize sales and profits. Some 
stores offer a wide variety of services, such as gift wrapping, alterations, returns, interior 
design services, and delivery. Other stores offer bare-bones customer service, stressing low 
price instead. Some grocery shoppers, for instance, can find convenience online through a 
service like Peapod, which handles product selection, packing, and delivery. They can visit a 
supermarket and make their own selections. Or they can go to a discount supermarket like 
Minnesota-based Cub Foods, a division of SuperValu, where they not only assemble their 
orders but also bag their purchases.
Selecting a Pricing Strategy Retailers base their pricing decisions on the 
costs of purchasing products from other channel members and offering services to cus-
tomers. Pricing can play a major role in consumers’ perceptions of a retailer, and not just 
because they appreciate low prices. The grocery retailer Trader Joe’s offers organic and 
gourmet foods under its own private labels at rock-bottom prices. Customers enjoy shopping 
for Trader Jose’s Mexican specialties and Trader Darwin’s nutritional supplements at prices 
lower than other gourmet or organic markets.28 Pricing strategy is covered in more detail in 
Chapter 13.
Choosing a Location A good location often marks the difference between suc-
cess and failure in retailing. The location decision depends on the retailer’s size, financial 
resources, product offerings, competition, and, of course, its target market. Traffic patterns, 
the visibility of the store’s signage, parking, and the location of complementary stores also 
influence the choice of a retail location. Consider the rivalry between PetSmart and Petco. 
Petco tends to have smaller stores in greater numbers, located in strip malls, than PetSmart,

Some shopping malls have banned unsupervised minors on week-
end evenings. Others are considering a total ban on teens who are not 
accompanied by adults. Teenagers go to malls not only to hang out 
with their friends but also to spend money. Mall merchants who used 
to complain about groups of unsupervised teenagers have now pinned 
their hopes on these young spenders to increase sales. Although they 
are more cautious shoppers than before the recession, teenagers are 
once again snacking at the food court and shopping at stores such as 
American Eagle and Abercrombie & Fitch.
Should malls that have essentially imposed curfews 
on teenagers consider lifting those bans to help 
boost business?
Summary
Just as adults spent much less during the recent recession, so did their children. “Bank of Mom 
and Dad—on pretty much all levels—basically shut down,” said one retail analyst. Teenagers have now 
returned in some measure to their impulsive shopping habits. Mall owners and civic leaders will need to 
find a balance between maintaining order and encouraging these consumers of tomorrow.

whose strategy is to build bigger “power centers” right beside other large discount chains. 
PetSmart has added pet services—adoption, grooming, day care, and boarding—in some of 
its stores. Petco uses its stores to promote a broader selection of goods for offbeat pets, such 
as tarantulas and unusual reptiles. Both companies have implemented “green” initiatives.29
A planned shopping center is a group of retail stores planned, coordinated, and marketed 
as a unit to shoppers in a geographical trade area. By providing single convenient locations 
with free parking, shopping centers have largely replaced downtown shopping in many urban 
areas. But time-pressed consumers are increasingly looking for more efficient ways to shop, 
including catalogs, Internet retailers, and one-stop shopping at large free-standing stores 
such as Walmart Supercenters. To lure more customers, shopping centers are recasting 
themselves as entertainment destinations, with movie theaters, art displays, carousel rides, 
and musical entertainment. The giant Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, features 
a seven-acre amusement park and an aquarium.
Shopping malls are well-known magnets for teens, who often meet there to socialize 
with friends. Businesses want to welcome their teen customers, but sometimes the cluster of 
teens hanging around the mall causes difficulties for other customers and some retailers, as 
described in the “Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature.

To varying degrees in recent years, large regional malls have also witnessed a grow-
ing shift in shopping center traffic to smaller strip centers, name-brand outlet centers, and 
lifestyle centers, open-air complexes containing retailers that often focus on specific shopper 
segments and product interests. Victoria Gardens, a lifestyle center in California, recently 
formed partnerships with local businesses that sponsor its family-loyalty program, VG Kidz. 
VG Kidz promotes healthy food choices and an active lifestyle for children and their fami-
lies. According to Masa Liles, the director of marketing for Victoria Gardens, “The current 
economy has forced all of us to be creative about our marketing initiatives and VG is no 
exception. These paid sponsorships will not only help our bottom line, but give depth to our 
programming and another way shoppers can interact with our property.”30
Building a Promotional Strategy A retailer designs advertisements and 
develops other promotions to stimulate demand and to provide information such as the 
store’s location, merchandise offerings, prices, and hours. When a recent year proved to 
be difficult, Starbucks turned to social media for a new promotional strategy. The chain 
launched MyStarbucksIdea.com, a forum where customers could ask questions, offer sugges-
tions, and even voice their dislikes. The site’s 180,000 registered users have offered 80,000 
ideas, of which 50 have been implemented. The Starbucks Facebook page has some 5.7 
million fans; the chain also has 775,000 Twitter followers. Charles Bruzzo, the chain’s vice 
president for brand, content, and online, says the company is seeing the beginning of an 
“interesection between digital and physical.”31
Nonstore retailers provide their phone numbers and Web site addresses. More recently, 
online retailers have scaled back their big advertising campaigns and worked to build traf-
fic through word of mouth and clever promotions. Promotional strategy is also discussed in 
depth in Chapter 13.
Creating a Store Atmosphere A successful retailer closely aligns its mer-
chandising, pricing, and promotion strategies with store atmospherics, the physical charac-
teristics of a store and its amenities, to influence consumers’ perceptions of the shopping 
experience. Atmospherics begin with the store’s exterior, which may use eye-catching archi-
tectural elements and signage to attract customer attention and interest. Interior atmospheric 
elements include store layout, merchandise presentation, lighting, color, sound, and clean-
liness. A high-end store such as Nordstrom, for instance, features high-ceilings in selling 
areas that spotlight tasteful and meticulously cared-for displays of carefully chosen items of 
obvious quality. Dick’s Sporting Goods, on the other hand, carries an ever-changing array of 
moderately priced clothing and gear in its warehouselike settings furnished with industrial-
style display hardware.
Distribution Channel Decisions 
and Logistics
Every firm faces two major decisions when choosing how to distribute its goods or 
services: selecting a specific distribution channel and deciding on the level of distribution 
intensity. In deciding which distribution channel is most efficient, business managers need 
to consider four factors: the market, the product, the producer, and the competition. These 
factors are often interrelated and may change over time. In today’s global business environ-
ment, strong relationships with customers and suppliers are important for survival. One way

414
to help cement such relationships online is to prac-
tice proper social media manners, as the “Business 
Etiquette” feature explains.
Selecting Distribution 
Channels
Market factors may be the most important 
consideration in choosing a distribution channel. 
To reach a target market with a small number of 
buyers or buyers concentrated in a geographical 
area, the most feasible alternative may be a direct 
channel. In contrast, if the firm must reach custom-
ers who are dispersed or who make frequent small 
purchases, then the channel may need to incorpo-
rate marketing intermediaries to make goods avail-
able when and where customers want them.
In general, standardized products or items with 
low unit values usually pass through relatively long 
distribution channels. On the other hand, prod-
ucts that are complex, expensive, custom made, 
or perishable move through shorter distribution 
channels involving few—or no—intermediaries. 
The increasing prevalence of e-commerce is result-
ing in changes in traditional distribution practices. 
The European Commission recently issued a set 
of rules, effective until 2022, that permit mak-
ers of goods with less than a 30 percent market 
share—usually high-end manufacturers—to block 
Internet-only retailers from carrying their prod-
ucts. The commission declared that “suppliers 
should normally be free to decide on the number 
and type of distributors they want to have in their 
distribution systems. . . . More generally, suppli-
ers may only want to sell to distributors that have 
one or more physical points of present [actual 
“bricks-and-mortar” stores] where the suppliers’ 
goods can be touched, smelled, tried, etc.” The 
European Alliance—which represents luxury goods 
manufacturers such as LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët 
Hennessey, Gucci, and Burberry—lobbied for and 
welcomed the new rules as a way to protect the 
quality image of their products. Online-only retail-
ers, such as Amazon, eBay, and their European 
counterparts, called for repeal of the “bricks-and-
mortar” requirement and warned that some manu-
facturers would use the new rules to “restrict the 
availability” of their products online and thus keep 
prices high.32
Minding Your Social Media Manners
More and more entrepreneurs are using social networking media to promote 
their small or medium-size businesses. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and myriad 
blogs and forums offer endless marketing opportunities. A recent survey found 
that 70 percent of small businesses planned to increase their use of social 
media. Seventy-nine percent did not plan to run TV commercials, and 70 
percent didn’t use radio.
Just as in the real business world, good manners, common courtesy, and 
common sense will take you far in the virtual business world. Here are a few 
tips on good manners for social media:
1 
 Even though you join social networks to promote your business, don’t make it too obvious. 
Instead of promoting yourself or your business nonstop, use selected 
posts to indicate that you have something of value to offer to interested 
people. Otherwise, you run the risk of being considered a spammer.
2 
Be aware that you are in social networks for the long haul. Group or forum members 
are real people with real interests and ideas. Get to know the members 
of your forums, ﬁ nd out what those interests are, and learn how the com-
munity as a whole works. Virtual networks of “friends” have unwritten 
rules, just as real networks do.
3 
It’s not the numbers that count. Getting your brand known or achieving other 
marketing goals doesn’t necessarily depend on how many Twitter follow-
ers you have but on how you engage with them.
4 
Be careful of what you say. Avoid vulgar language, off-color jokes, or any hint 
of racial or gender bias. Don’t bring up religion, politics, or other delicate 
subjects. Leave any strong opinions out of your marketing proﬁ le.
5 
Remember that your customers will be discussing you on their own networks. Your repu-
tation may travel farther than you know!

The Greek entrepreneur Stelios Haji-Ioannou, however, finds the Internet the perfect 
channel for easyGroup, the private investment group for his “easy” brand. The company 
represents a variety of businesses with the “easy” tag—including easyJet.com, easyCar.com, 
easyJobs.com, easyPizza.com, and even an easyBus route between Gatwick Airport and 
London. Each business offers a no-frills, low-cost approach to services that consumers can 
order online. EasyJet is one of Europe’s biggest Internet retailers, selling 95 percent of its 
seats online.33
Producers that offer a broad product line, with the financial and marketing resources to 
distribute and promote it, are more likely to choose a shorter channel. Instead of depending 
on marketing intermediaries, financially strong manufacturers with broad product lines typi-
cally use their own sales representatives, warehouses, and credit departments to serve both 
retailers and consumers.
In many cases, start-up manufacturers turn to direct channels because they can’t per-
suade intermediaries to carry their products or because they want to extend their sales reach. 
Some companies employ direct channels to carry intangible goods as well. Based in New 
York City, Art Meets Commerce uses the Internet and social networking to promote small 
Broadway and off-Broadway shows with tight marketing budgets. The company posts short 
videos of its client shows on YouTube and takes advantage of Facebook and Twitter to 
amplify traditional word-of-mouth publicity. When celebrities see the shows and post favor-
able tweets, their followers may feel encouraged to see the shows too.34
Competitive performance is the fourth key consideration when choosing a distribution 
channel. A producer loses customers when an intermediary fails to achieve promotion or 
product delivery. Channels used by established competitors as well as new market entries 
also can influence decisions. Sometimes a joint venture between competitors can work well. 
Best Buy and Apple have teamed up to sell their products under the same roof. Under the 
agreement, Apple controls its own retail space within Best Buy stores. Although Apple has a 
well-established retail business, it can’t match the size of electronics giant Best Buy. Best Buy 
benefits by generating more traffic from customers who want to see and buy Apple’s innova-
tive products in convenient locations. The strategy has worked well, as the sales of Macs in 
particular have increased. Best Buy was the only non-Apple retailer in the United States to 
carry the iPad. All of Best Buy’s 673 stores with Apple shops sold out their stock of iPads in 
four days.35
Selecting Distribution Intensity
A second key distribution decision involves distribution intensity—the number of inter-
mediaries or outlets through which a manufacturer distributes its goods. Only one BMW 
dealership may be operating in your immediate area, but you can find Coca-Cola every-
where—in supermarkets, convenience stores, gas stations, vending machines, and restaurants. 
BMW has chosen a different level of distribution intensity than that used for Coca-Cola. In 
general, market coverage varies along a continuum with three different intensity levels:
1. Intensive distribution involves placing a firm’s products in nearly every available outlet. 
Generally, intensive distribution suits low-priced convenience goods such as milk, news-
papers, and soft drinks. This kind of market saturation requires cooperation by many 
intermediaries, including wholesalers and retailers, to achieve maximum coverage.
2. Selective distribution is a market-coverage strategy in which a manufacturer selects only a 
limited number of retailers to distribute its product lines. Selective distribution can reduce 
total marketing costs and establish strong working relationships within the channel.

3.  Exclusive distribution, at the other end of 
the continuum from intensive distribution, 
limits market coverage in a specific geo-
graphical region. The approach suits rela-
tively expensive specialty products such 
as Rolex watches. Retailers are carefully 
selected to enhance the product’s image to 
the market and to ensure that well-trained 
personnel will contribute to customer sat-
isfaction. Although producers may sacri-
fice some market coverage by granting an 
exclusive territory to a single intermediary, 
the decision usually pays off in developing 
and maintaining an image of quality and 
prestige.
When companies are offloading excess 
inventory, even high-priced retailers may 
look to discounters to help them clear the 
merchandise from their warehouses. To 
satisfy consumers’ taste for luxury goods, 
designer outlet malls offer shoppers a chance to buy status items at lower prices. Philadelphia 
Premium Outlets shopping center contains more than 100 stores carrying such brands as 
Calphalon kitchenware, Coach handbags, and Neiman Marcus Last Call. Other similar out-
let malls are Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, north of New York City, and Desert 
Hills Premium Outlets in Cabazon, California.36
Logistics and Physical Distribution
A firm’s choice of distribution channels creates the final link in the supply chain, the 
complete sequence of suppliers that contribute to creating a good or service and delivering 
it to business users and final consumers. The supply chain begins when the raw materials 
used in production are delivered to the producer and continues with the actual production 
activities that create finished goods. Finally, the finished goods move through the producer’s 
distribution channels to end customers.
The process of coordinating the flow of goods, services, and information among 
members of the supply chain is called logistics. The term originally referred to strategic 
movements of military troops and supplies. Today, however, it describes all of the business 
activities involved in the supply chain with the ultimate goal of getting finished goods to 
customers.
Physical Distribution A major focus of logistics management—identified earlier 
in the chapter as one of the two basic dimensions of distribution strategy—is physical distribu-
tion, the activities aimed at efficiently moving finished goods from the production line to the 
consumer or business buyer. As Figure 12.9 shows, physical distribution is a broad concept 
that includes transportation and numerous other elements that help link buyers and sellers. 
An effectively managed physical distribution system can increase customer satisfaction by 
ensuring reliable movements of products through the supply chain. For instance, Walmart

studies the speed with which goods can be shelved once they arrive at the store because 
strategies that look efficient at the warehouse, such as completely filling pallets with goods, 
can actually be time-consuming or costly in the aisles.
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology relies on a computer chip implanted 
somewhere on a product or its packaging that emits a low-frequency radio signal identifying 
the item. The radio signal doesn’t require a line of sight to register on the store’s comput-
ers the way a bar code does, so a hand-held RFID reader can scan crates and cartons before 
they are unloaded. Because the chip can store information about the product’s progress 
through the distribution channel, retailers can efficiently manage inventories, maintain 
stock levels, reduce loss, track stolen goods, and cut costs. The technology is similar to that 
already used to identify lost pets and speed vehicles through toll booths. Walmart, Target, 
the U.S. Department of Defense, and the German retailer Metro Group already require 
their suppliers to use RFID technology. The U.S. Army is now using solar power to activate 
battery-powered RFIDs, which are particularly useful in remote areas. Automakers are also 
using RFID technology to improve their production processes by tracking parts and other 
supplies. A new version of the RFID chip can be printed on paper or plastic. RFID technol-
ogy brings with it privacy and counterfeiting concerns. Recently one company developed a 
process that uses unique silicon “fingerprints” to generate unclonable RFID chips.37
Warehousing is the physical distribution activity that involves the storage of products. 
Materials handling is moving items within factories, warehouses, transportation terminals, 
and stores. Inventory control involves managing inventory costs, such as storage facilities, 
insurance, taxes, and handling. The physical distribution activity of order processing includes 
preparing orders for shipment and receiving orders when shipments arrive.
The wide use of electronic data interchange (EDI) and the constant pressure on suppli-
ers to improve their response time have led to vendor-managed inventory, in which the 
producer and the retailer agree that the producer (or the wholesaler) will determine how 
much of a product a buyer needs and automatically ship new supplies when needed.
The form of transportation used to ship products depends primarily on the kind of 
product, the distance involved, and the cost. The logistics manager can choose from a 
number of companies and modes of transportation. As Table 12.3 shows, the five major 
transport modes are—in order of total expenditures—trucks (with about 75 percent of total 
expenditures), railroads (approximately 12 percent), water carriers (6 percent), air freight 
vendor-managed 
inventory process in 
which the producer and the 
retailer agree that the pro-
ducer (or the wholesaler) 
will determine how much 
of a product a buyer needs 
and automatically ship new 
supplies when needed.

(4 percent), and pipelines (3 percent). The faster methods typically cost more than the 
slower ones. Speed, reliable delivery, shipment frequency, location availability, handling flex-
ibility, and cost are all important considerations when choosing the most appropriate mode 
of transportation.
About 15.5 million trucks operate in the United States, carrying most finished goods all 
or part of the way to the consumer. Nearly 2 million of these are tractor trailers.38 But rail-
roads, which compete with many truck routes despite their recent loss of market share, are 
a major mode of transportation. The 565 freight railroads in the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico operate across more than 202,000 miles of track and earn almost $75 billion in rev-
enues. Seventy percent of all autos manufactured in the United States travel to their destina-
tions by train, as does 70 percent of the country’s coal. A freight train needs only 1 gallon of 
diesel fuel to transport 1 ton of cargo almost 425 miles.39
Customer Service Customer service is a vital component of both product and 
distribution strategies. Customer service standards measure the quality of service a firm pro-
vides for its customers. Managers frequently set quantitative guidelines—for example, that 
all orders be processed within 24 hours after they are received or that salespeople approach 
shoppers within two minutes after they enter the store. Sometimes customers set their own 
service standards and choose suppliers that meet or exceed them.
The customer service components of product strategy include warranty and repair ser-
vice programs. Warranties are firms’ promises to repair a defective product, refund money 
paid, or replace a product if it proves unsatisfactory. Repair services are also important. 
Consumers want to know that help is available if something goes wrong. Those who shop 
for home computers, for example, often choose retailers that not only feature low prices but 
also offer repair services and tech support centers. Products with inadequate service backing 
quickly disappear from the market as a result of word-of-mouth criticism.
Consumers’ complaints of the impersonal service they received at Web sites led 
dot-coms to take a number of steps to “humanize” their customer interactions and deal 
with complaints. Many Web sites contain button help icons that link the visitor to a 
representative.

Chapter 12  Product and Distribution Strategies
What’s Ahead
This chapter covered two of the elements of the marketing mix: product and distri-
bution. It introduced the key marketing tasks of developing, marketing, and packaging 
want-satisfying goods and services. It also focused on the three major components of an 
organization’s distribution strategy: the design of efficient distribution channels; wholesalers 
and retailers who make up many distribution channels; and logistics and physical distribu-
tion. We now turn to the remaining two—promotion and pricing—in Chapter 13.
Summary of Learning Goals
Explain marketing’s definition of a product; differentiate 
among convenience, shopping, and specialty products; and 
distinguish between a product mix and a product line.
A product is a bundle of physical, service, and symbolic 
attributes designed to satisfy consumer wants. The market-
ing conception of a product includes the brand, product 
image, warranty, service attributes, packaging, and labeling, 
in addition to the physical or functional characteristics of the 
good or service.
Goods and services can be classified as consumer (B2C) 
or business (B2B) products. Consumer products are those 
purchased by ultimate consumers for their own use. They 
can be convenience products, shopping products, or specialty 
products, depending on consumer habits in buying them. 
Business products are those purchased for use either directly 
or indirectly in the production of other goods and services 
for resale. They can be classified as installations, accessory 
equipment, component parts and materials, raw materials, 
and supplies. This classification is based on how the items 
are used and product characteristics. Services can be classi-
fied as either consumer or business services.
A product mix is the assortment of goods and services a 
firm offers to individual consumers and B2B users. A prod-
uct line is a series of related products.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 How do consumer products differ from business 
products? Business products, such as drill presses, are sold 
to firms or organizations. Consumer products, such as per-
sonal-care items, are sold to final users.
1.2 Differentiate among convenience, shopping, and 
specialty products. Convenience products are items the 
consumer seeks to purchase frequently, immediately, and 
with little effort. Shopping products are typically purchased 
after the buyer has compared competing products in 
competing stores. Specialty products are those a purchaser is 
willing to make a special effort to obtain.
Briefly describe each of the four stages of the product life 
cycle with their marketing implications.
Every successful new product passes through four stages in 
its product life cycle: introduction, growth, maturity, and 
decline. In the introduction stage, the firm attempts to elicit 
demand for the new product. In the product’s growth stage, 
sales climb, and the company earns its initial profits. In the 
maturity stage, sales reach a saturation level. In the decline 
stage, both sales and profits decline. Marketers sometimes 
employ strategies to extend the product life cycle, including 
increasing the frequency of use, adding new users, finding 
new uses for the product, and changing package size, labe-
ling, or product quality.
The new-product development process for most 
products has six stages: idea generation, screening, concept 
development and business analysis, product development, 
test marketing, and commercialization. At each stage, 
marketers must decide whether to continue to the next 
stage, modify the new product, or discontinue the develop-
ment process. Some new products skip the test marketing 
stage due to the desire to quickly introduce a new product 
with excellent potential, a desire not to reveal new-product 
strategies to competitors, and the high costs involved in 
limited production runs.

2.2 What are the marketing implications of each stage? 
Marketers sometimes employ strategies to extend the 
product life cycle, including increasing frequency of use, 
adding new users, finding new uses for the product, and 
changing package size, labeling, or product quality.
Explain how firms identify their products.
Products are identified by brands, brand names, and 
trademarks, which are important elements of product 
images. Effective brand names are easy to pronounce, 
recognize, and remember, and they project the right 
images to buyers. Brand names cannot contain generic 
words. Under certain circumstances, companies lose 
exclusive rights to their brand names if common use makes 
them generic terms for product categories. Some brand 
names belong to retailers or distributors rather than to 
manufacturers. Brand loyalty is measured in three degrees: 
brand recognition, brand preference, and brand insistence. 
Some marketers use family brands to identify several related 
items in a product line. Others employ individual branding 
strategies by giving each product within a line a different 
brand name.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 Differentiate among a brand, a brand name, and a 
trademark. A brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, design, or 
some combination thereof used to identify the products of 
one firm and differentiate them from competitive offerings. 
A brand name is that part of the brand consisting of words 
or letters used to identify and distinguish the firm’s offerings 
from those of competitors. A trademark is a brand that has 
been given legal protection.
3.2 Define brand equity. Brand equity is the added value 
that a respected and successful brand name gives to a 
product.
Outline and briefly describe each of the major components 
of an effective distribution strategy.
A firm must consider whether to move products through 
direct or indirect distribution. Once the decision is made, 
the company needs to identify the types of marketing inter-
mediaries, if any, through which it will distribute its goods 
and services. The Internet has made direct distribution an 
attractive option for many retail companies. Another com-
ponent is distribution intensity. The business must decide 
on the amount of market coverage—intensive, selective, 
or exclusive—needed to achieve its marketing strategies. 
Finally, attention must be paid to managing the distribution 
channel. It is vital to minimize conflict between channel 
members.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 Define distribution channels. Distribution channels are 
the paths that products, and title to them, follow from pro-
ducer to consumer or business user.
4.2 What is a marketing intermediary? A marketing 
intermediary (also called a middleman) is a business firm 
that moves goods between producers and consumers or 
business users.
Distinguish between different types of wholesaling 
intermediaries.
Wholesaling is a crucial part of the distribution channel 
for many products, particularly consumer goods and 
business supplies. Wholesaling intermediaries can be 
classified on the basis of ownership; some are owned by 
manufacturers, some are owned by retailers, and others 
are independently owned. Firms operate two main types 
of manufacturer-owned wholesaling intermediaries: sales 
branches and sales offices.
An independent wholesaling intermediary is a business 
that represents a number of different manufacturers and 
makes sales calls on retailers, manufacturers, and other 
business accounts. Independent wholesalers are classified 
as either merchant wholesalers or agents and brokers, 
depending on whether they take title to the products 
they handle.
Retailers sometimes band together to form their own 
wholesaling organizations. Such organizations can take the 
form of either a buying group or a cooperative.

5.1 Define wholesaling. Wholesaling is a crucial part of the 
distribution channel for many products, particularly con-
sumer goods and business supplies.
5.2 Differentiate between a merchant wholesaler and an 
agent or broker in terms of title to the goods. Merchant 
wholesalers are independently owned wholesaling interme-
diaries that take title to the goods they handle. Agents and 
brokers may or may not take possession of the goods they 
handle, but they never take title, working mainly to bring 
buyers and sellers together.
Describe the various types of retailers, and identify retail 
strategies.
Retailers, in contrast to wholesalers, are distribution channel 
members that sell goods and services to individuals for their 
own use rather than for resale. Nonstore retailing includes 
four forms: direct-response retailing, Internet retailing, auto-
matic merchandising, and direct selling. Store retailers range 
in size from tiny newsstands to multistory department stores 
and warehouselike retailers such as Sam’s Club.

Chapter 12  Product and Distribution Strategies
The first step in developing a competitive retailing 
strategy is to select a target market. Next, the retailer must 
develop a product strategy to determine the best mix of mer-
chandise to carry to satisfy that market. A retailer’s customer 
service strategy focuses on attracting and retaining target 
customers to maximize sales and profits. Retailers base their 
pricing decisions on the costs of purchasing products from 
other channel members and offering services to customers. 
A good location often marks the difference between success 
and failure in retailing. A retailer designs advertisements 
and develops other promotions to stimulate demand and to 
provide information such as the store’s location, merchan-
dise offerings, prices, and hours. A successful retailer closely 
aligns its merchandising, pricing, and promotion strategies 
with store atmospherics, the physical characteristics of a 
store and its amenities, to influence consumers’ perceptions 
of the shopping experience.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 Define retailer. Retailers are distribution channel 
members that sell goods and services to individuals for their 
own use rather than for resale.
6.2 What are the elements of a retailer’s marketing strat-
egy? After identifying their target markets, retailers must 
choose merchandising, customer service, pricing, and location 
strategies that will attract customers in those market segments.
Identify the various categories of distribution 
channels, and discuss the factors that influence 
channel selection.
Marketers can choose either a direct distribution channel, 
which moves goods directly from the producer to the con-
sumer, or indirect distribution channels, which involve 
marketing intermediaries in the paths through which 
products—and legal ownership of them—flow from 
producer to the final customer. Ideally, the choice of a 
distribution channel should support a firm’s overall 
marketing strategy. Before selecting distribution channels, 
firms must consider their target markets, the types of 
goods being distributed, their own internal systems and 
concerns, and competitive factors.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 What is distribution intensity? Distribution intensity 
is the number of intermediaries or outlets through which a 
manufacturer distributes its goods.
7.2 Define supply chain. A supply chain is the sequence of 
suppliers that contribute to creating a good or service and 
delivering it to business users and final consumers.

Chapter 12  Product and Distribution Strategies
Chanel. Armani. BMW. Cartier. These long-established, 
high-end brands are very interested in Generation Y, also 
known as the Millennials—those born during the 1980s 
and who are now between 18 and 28 years old. The new-
est challenge these once-exclusive brands face is marketing 
to this age group.
According to a recent marketing survey, Millennials are 
the “largest consumer group in U.S. history,” even bigger 
than the baby-boom generation, the previous record hold-
ers. At 70 to 85 million, Millennials make up 25 percent 
of the American population. They are the most ethnically 
diverse group ever, as well as the least bound by gender 
stereotypes. They spend over $200 billion a year on pur-
chases. As they enter the workforce and set up their own 
households, they will overtake the soon-to-retire baby 
boomers in spending power.
Even more important is how Millennials get informa-
tion and communicate. Unlike any previous generation, 
they have grown up with digital technology and take cell 
phones, video games, and other high-speed electronic 
devices and media for granted. They are used to instantly 
available information and communication. A recent sur-
vey by the Pew Research Center notes that 75 percent of 
Generation Y uses social networking, in contrast to 50 
percent of Generation X (30 to 45 years old) and 30 percent 
of baby boomers (46 to 64 years old). 
Millennials are very aware of the value of what they 
buy. The marketing survey found that 65 percent of female 
Millennials and 61 percent of males describe themselves 
as brand conscious. But heritage and exclusivity, formerly 
effective marketing tools for prestige brands, mean little 
to Millennials, who instead value quality, authenticity, and 
image. They shun anything that resembles self-promotion 
in either brands or people, including prominently displayed 
corporate logos. 
Burberry, a maker of high-end clothing and acces-
sories established in 1836, recently began an ambitious 
multimedia effort to reach Millennials in the digital universe. 
One of the company’s first moves was to hire the actress 
Emma Watson, world famous for playing Hermione Granger 
in the Harry Potter movies. A Millennial born in 1990, she 
was the new face of Burberry’s spring–summer campaign. 
In addition to traditional print advertising and, of course, 
its home Web site, Burberry has employed live streaming 
and 3D filming of its fashion shows. With the photo blog-
ger Scott Schuman, known as the Sartorialist, the company 
also launched a special Web site, Art of the Trench, to 
promote its classic trench coat. Burberry’s Facebook page 
calls Art of the Trench “a living celebration of the trench 
coat and the people who wear it.” The Web site, essentially 
a social networking blog, invites owners to submit photos 
of themselves wearing their trench coats—or to submit 
videos to its YouTube channel. Links allow visitors to “view 
details,” “like,” “share,” and “leave comments” on the 
photos. They can also sort the photos by popularity, gender, 
styling, trench color, and weather. The site features music 
by the Maccabees, White Lies, and other groups, with links 
to their Web sites. Burberry’s CEO, Angela Ahrendts, said, 
“Attracting the Millennial customer to luxury started two 
years ago—I said that we can either get crushed or ride the 
greatest wave of our life.”
Scott Galloway of New York University’s School of 
Business says, “Gen Y goodwill is arguably the closest thing 
to a crystal ball for predicting a brand’s long-term prospects. 
Just as Boomers drove the luxury sector for the last 
20 years, brands that resonate with Gen Y, whose 
purchasing power will surpass that of Boomers by 2017, 
will be the new icons of prestige.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Millennials are brand conscious but generally 
dislike conspicuous, flashy brand logos. How 
might this affect a company’s brand equity?
2. Burberry is basing its product strategy on how 
Millennials use the Internet and social media, 
as opposed to how their elders do. Do you 
think this difference in use will continue as the 
Millennials mature? If so, how might Burberry 
change its product strategy?

Nearly all observers are sure that someday soon, con-
sumers will watch televisions anywhere, on any device—
television, computer, or smartphone. Today, once major 
shows are aired, broadcast TV networks upload them onto 
their Web sites or to sites such as Hulu and YouTube. One 
survey reported that in one month alone, more than 178 
million Americans watched 33 billion TV shows online.
Across the Atlantic, Britons use BBC’s iPlayer to catch 
up with missed TV episodes online. The BBC and other 
British networks plan to unite broadcast television with 
online media in a new, hybrid configuration.
In the United States, viewers have enjoyed watching 
TV shows on their computers for free. Those days may be 
over soon—or then again, it may take a little longer.
Advertising fees bring a total of $70 billion to broad-
cast and cable television networks. Cable and satellite 
providers pay broadcast networks billions more in retrans-
mission fees and make billions in fees from subscribers.
But when broadcast television networks upload their 
shows to the Internet, viewers don’t have to pay cable 
and satellite providers, and the networks lose the revenue 
from cable and satellite licensing fees. Advertisers pay 
the networks for the right to embed their ads within the 
video content. But many advertisers shy away from online 
television because there is still no clear way to measure 
how effective their commercials will be. One observer says, 
“Advertisers aren’t going to pay for the right to sponsor 
content [TV shows] unless they know how many people 
are watching it. The technology is available, but it is still in 
the process of being implemented.”
Online television still has one major drawback: most 
of it is not live. CBS had live, online coverage of the recent 
NCAA basketball tournament, but that was an exception. 
Live broadcasts of shows such as American Idol and 
the Super Bowl charge the highest advertising fees. But 
online licensing problems and technical issues have made 
TV networks wary of live online broadcasting.
As viewers exercise their increasing options to watch 
what they want when they want it, some analysts predict 
that the only programs that large numbers of people will 
view at the same time will be sports events and news 
programs. Some viewers have even stopped their cable 
subscriptions and watch TV exclusively online via down-
loads from Netflix, iTunes, and Amazon.
Another difficulty is that no one has yet developed 
a way to make the potentially infinite array of Internet 
programming available on television in a user-friendly 
manner. But as in Europe, Internet-ready televisions will 
be available in the United States. Best Buy has announced 
that soon all the Internet-ready televisions it sells will give 
buyers the option of subscribing to a Best Buy trove of 
downloadable broadcast materials. Other TV manufactur-
ers will likely make similar offers.
Subscription television services may be the way of 
the future, although some generic shows, such as news, 
cooking shows, and how-to programs will remain free just 
because they are not unique. Recently, Microsoft unveiled 
its Mediaroom 2.0, which combines client software with 
cloud-based services to allow consumers to watch shows 
either on a flat-screen TV, a personal computer, or, in the 
future, on compatible smart phones. Enrique Rodriguez, 
Microsoft’s corporate vice president for TV, Video and 
Music Business, says, “We want to make it easier for con-
sumers to find and discover great content, to watch, listen 
and engage in new ways, and to do so anywhere and on 
any screen.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. At what stage would you say broadcast televi-
sion is in the product life cycle? What steps have 
the broadcast networks taken to prolong the 
life cycle of their product?
2. At this time, broadcast and cable television, 
Internet programming, and advertisers all 
have different distribution strategies. How 
might they bring these strategies closer 
together?

Secret Acres: Getting the Word Out
CASE 1.3
Case 12.3
No matter how powerful they are, comic book heroes can’t get 
themselves into bookstores—and readers’ hands—without a little help. 
Leon Avelino and Barry Matthews, co-founders of Secret Acres, know 
that one of the greatest challenges of publishing is getting books onto 
the shelves and into readers’ shopping carts. The task is even more 
difficult for small publishers—in this case, small publishers of comic 
books and graphic novels—because they don’t have the wide distribu-
tion network of major publishers. But Avelino and Matthews, whose 
authors consider them the superheroes of comicbook publishing, are 
undaunted. They know what they are trying to achieve and work dog-
gedly to make it happen.
 “Distribution is a difficult thing right now,” admits Matthews. 
“The publishing industry is changing and comic books themselves 
have a different distribution methodology and wholesale methodology 
than traditional books do.” Unlike conventional book shops, comic 
book shops do not operate on a return basis. Conventional bookstores 
receive a small discount when they purchase books from a publisher, 
but then have the option to return any unsold books to the publisher. 
Comic book shops take a deeper discount but make no returns. 
Matthews also notes that currently there is only one major distributor 
of comic books—Diamond Distributors—which has the leverage to 
dictate much of what happens in the business of comic book distribu-
tion. In addition, Matthews observes that Secret Acres’ graphic novels 
could easily be sold to the general book market, but many general book 
distributors prefer not to deal with smaller publishers because they sim-
ply don’t produce enough books to be profitable.
All of that said, Matthews explains that they are learning alter-
native ways to distribute their books. “Amazon is great,” he says. 
“They make it very easy for smaller publishers. They treat your books 
as if they are Amazon books, giving them the sheen of being part of 
a larger retail channel.” Amazon does take a significant cut of sales, 
but Matthews says it’s worth it to broaden the distribution of Secret 
Acres products. Of course, Secret Acres also sells its entire line directly 
through its Web site at http://www.secretacres.com, along with some 
books from other independent authors and publishers. This sales 
method is the most profitable for Secret Acres. More importantly, it 
allows Matthews and Avelino to keep closer tabs on their readers. 
Matthews explains that because orders are filled on an individual basis, 
he can slip promotional materials, notices of upcoming events or new 
books, and tie-ins right into the package of a customer whose prefer-
ences he knows. This one-on-one interaction helps in the management 
of customer relationships.
Matthews and Avelino also enjoy one other form of distribu-
tion—attending comic book conventions around the country, such 
as the Stumptown Comics Fest in Portland, Oregon. There, they have 
the opportunity to interact with readers, other publishers, comic book 
authors and artists, and even some smaller distributors who have 
begun to attend these events. They note that readers in particular love 
to meet the authors and artists. “It feeds the interest in what we’re 
doing,” says Matthews. While at an event, Matthews and Avelino try 
to carve out some time to meet with other small publishers. “A lot of 
small publishers are in the same position” with regard to distribution, 
Matthews explains. “So we have been talking with them to see if we 
can band together to share resources.”
For the future, Matthews admits that he and Avelino have no idea 
how some of the new technologies, including e-readers, will ultimately 
affect distribution, but they plan to research the possibility of digitizing 
some of Secret Acres’ titles for online distribution. 
Despite its small size, Secret Acres’ authors consider the firm a 
mighty one. Theo Ellsworth, author of such titles as Capacity and Sleeper 
Car, praises Secret Acres for its personal attention and efforts to market 
and distribute his books. “It feels good to have the distribution part in 
someone else’s hands,” says Ellsworth. He explains that having some-
one else take care of that aspect of publishing frees him up to concen-
trate on his art, producing more posters and books—which is, after all, 
the author’s job.
Questions for Critical Thinking

keting blurb describing the line to a potential distributor.
2. What steps can Secret Acres take to develop brand loyalty 
and ultimately brand equity for its products?
3. How might Secret Acres expand its Internet retailing 
presence?
4. Secret Acres is a tiny firm with limited distribution. How 
can the company use customer service to create a competi-
tive advantage, increase distribution, and help it grow?

Hotel Indigo Combines 
Individuality and Value
 U ntil a few years ago, perhaps the most 
familiar chain hotels in the InterContinental Hotels 
Group (IHG) were the Holiday Inns. Despite limited 
service and the same basic design, they have long 
been favorites of vacationing families and business 
travelers on the lookout for good deals. Although it 
already owned five other low- and high-end hotel 
chains, several years ago IHG launched a new one—
this time with a difference. The result is Hotel Indigo.
The Indigo hotels fall into the category of boutique 
hotels, a concept that began in the northern United 
States during the 1980s. The original boutique 
hotels actually were not chain affiliated and were 
known for their individual, fashionable design and 
flawless amenities and service. Although most of the 
early boutique hotels were small, some now have 
more than 100 rooms.
Indigo hotels intend to combine the best features of 
boutique hotels without the sometimes intimidating 
attitude. Although all the Indigos offer consistent, 
reliable service, each one is unique in design. 
Rather than building them from scratch and all 
alike, IHG adapts previously existing buildings, 
either buying other hotels or converting commercial 
spaces, apartment buildings, or historic structures. 
This allows the designers to make the most 
of a building’s original structure while adding 
unique features inspired by the building itself, the 
neighborhood and its history, and the city where 
it is located. All Indigo Hotels offer well-appointed 
rooms, including extended-stay suites, along with 
24-hour business centers, fitness centers, a bar and 
bistro serving drinks and light meals, and wired 
or WiFi Internet access. Some allow pets. Unlike 
other hotels, the Indigos post cards throughout 
with details of their employees’ interests and 
backgrounds. Front-desk personnel are trained to 
read visual cues to get acquainted with arriving 
guests, whether visiting for business or pleasure.
The Hotel Indigo Nashville Downtown opened 
recently, the second Indigo in that city. The 
designers converted two adjoining historic structures, 
the American Trust Building and the Nashville Trust 
Building, both from the 1920s. They retained the 
architecture and integrity of the buildings while 
creating a mixed-use complex that includes hotel 
suites, business office space, a two-story Starbucks, 
and a parking garage. In contrast, the Hotel 
Indigo San Antonio–Riverwalk, in San Antonio, 
Texas, preserves elements of Spanish mission-style 
architecture, with red tile roofs and a fountain in the 
front courtyard.
In growing the Indigo brand, IHG has opened 25 
hotels in the United States, focusing on major cities 
such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, 
D.C., and New York. It now has 35 Indigo hotels 
worldwide. The first non-U.S. branch was the Hotel 
Indigo London–Paddington, opened near London’s 
Paddington Station. Despite the recession, IHG 
opened 12 Indigo hotels in one year and finalized 
deals for 14 more around the world. New Indigos 
are planned for Glasgow, Scotland; Liverpool, 
England; and Hong Kong, among other locations. 
Just in time to welcome visitors to the World Expo 
in Shanghai, China—the Hotel Indigo Shanghai on 
the Bund opened for business. The first Indigo hotel 
in Asia, it is located on the banks of the Huangpu 
River in the historic Bund district of Shanghai, 
where Europeans and Americans built their banks 
and trading houses during the nineteenth century. 
Like the other Indigo hotels, it combines authentic 
local design with modern touches and the latest in 
amenities. Guests can even request private tai chi or 
yoga classes.
Although room rates have increased as the chain 
has expanded, Entrepreneur magazine recently gave 
Indigo its Annual Value Award for Best Value Hotel 
Chain, calling it a “boutique-style hotel informed by 
friendliness, not trendiness.”1

Part 4  Marketing Management
Overview
13
This chapter focuses on the different 
types of promotional activities and the way 
prices are established for goods and services. 
Promotion is the function of informing, 
persuading, and influencing a purchase deci-
sion. This activity is as important to not-
for-profit organizations as it is to profit-
seeking companies.
Some promotional strategies try to 
develop primary demand, or consumer desire 
for a general product category. The objec-
tive of such a campaign is to stimulate sales 
for an entire industry so that individual 
firms benefit from this market growth. 
A popular example is the dairy industry’s 
“Got Milk?” campaign. Print and television 
messages about the nutritional benefits of 
milk show various celebrities. Other pro-
motional campaigns aimed at increasing 
per-capita consumption have been com-
missioned by the California Strawberry 
Commission and the National Cattlemen’s 
Beef Association.
Most promotional strategies, in contrast, 
seek to stimulate selective demand—desire for 
a specific brand. Every driver needs some 
type of car insurance, and the Geico gecko 
wants consumers to pick its firm for low 
rates. Country-Western star Toby Keith pro-
motes Ford F-150 trucks, which encourages 
his fans to choose that brand over 
competitors. Sales promotions that offered 
teens a free iTunes song download for trying 
on a pair of Gap jeans also encouraged shop-
pers to purchase a specific brand.
Marketers choose from among many 
promotional options to communicate with 
potential customers. Each marketing 
promotion function of 
informing, persuading, 
and influencing a purchase 
decision.

message a buyer receives—through a televi-
sion or radio commercial, newspaper or 
magazine ad, Web site, direct-mail flyer, or 
sales call—reflects the product, place, per-
son, cause, or organization promoted in the 
content. Through integrated marketing 
communications (IMC), marketers coordi-
nate all promotional activities—media adver-
tising, direct mail, personal selling, sales 
promotion, and public relations—to produce 
a unified, customer-focused promotional 
strategy. This coordination is designed 
to avoid confusing the consumer and to 
focus positive attention on the promotional 
message.
This chapter begins by explaining the 
role of IMC and then discusses the objec-
tives of promotion and the importance of 
promotional planning. Next, it examines 
the components of the promotional mix: 
advertising, sales promotion, personal sell-
ing, and public relations. Finally, the chapter 
addresses pricing strategies for goods and 
services.

Integrated Marketing 
Communications
An integrated marketing communications strategy focuses on customer needs to create 
a unified promotional message in the firm’s ads, in-store displays, product samples, and pre-
sentations by company sales representatives. To gain a competitive advantage, marketers that 
implement IMC need a broad view of promotion. Media options continue to multiply, and 
marketers cannot simply rely on traditional broadcast and print media and direct mail. Plans 
must include all forms of customer contact. Packaging, store displays, sales promotions, sales 
presentations, and online and interactive media also communicate information about a brand 
or organization. With IMC, marketers create a unified personality and message for the good, 
brand, or service they promote. Coordinated activities also enhance the effectiveness of 
reaching and serving target markets.
Marketing managers set the goals and objectives for the firm’s promotional strategy 
with overall organizational objectives and marketing goals in mind. Based on these objec-
tives, marketers weave the various elements of the strategy—personal selling, advertising, 
sales promotion, publicity, and public relations—into an integrated communications 
plan. This document becomes a central part of the firm’s total marketing strategy to 
reach its selected target market. Feedback, including marketing research and sales reports, 
completes the system by identifying any deviations from the plan and suggesting 
improvements.
In its stepped-up IMC campaign “Get a Monster Advantage,” the job search engine 
Monster.com combined a number of marketing promotions. The campaign’s first TV 
commercial, featuring a down-on-his-luck Boogeyman who goes to Monster.com to find the 
perfect new job, aired during the AFC Championship Game. A second commercial, featur-
ing another character, aired during a recent Super Bowl game. Other spots were aired on 
national cable networks and included social media extensions. Humorous interactive links 
on sites such as Facebook and advertising on other sites further engaged the online audi-
ence. Print ads appeared in The Wall Street Journal and more than a hundred regional dailies 
as well as in monthly business publications and human resource publications such as HR 
Executive, Wired, and Fast Company.2

Part 4  Marketing Management
The Promotional Mix
Just as every organization creates a marketing mix combining product, distribution, 
promotion, and pricing strategies, each also requires a similar mix to blend the many facets 
of promotion into a cohesive plan. The promotional mix consists of two components—
personal and nonpersonal selling—that marketers combine to meet the needs of their firm’s 
target customers and effectively and efficiently communicate its message to them. Personal 
selling is the most basic form of promotion: a direct person-to-person promotional presen-
tation to a potential buyer. The buyer–seller communication can occur during a face-to-face 
meeting or via telephone, videoconference, or interactive computer link.
Nonpersonal selling consists of advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing, and 
public relations. Advertising is the best-known form of nonpersonal selling, but sales promo-
tion accounts for about half of these marketing expenditures. Spending for sponsorships, 
which involves marketing messages delivered in association with another activity such as 
a golf tournament or a benefit concert, is on the rise as well. Marketers need to be careful 
about the types of promotion they choose or risk alienating the very people they are trying 
to reach.
Each component in the promotional mix offers its own advantages and disadvantages, 
as Table 13.1 demonstrates. By selecting the most effective combination of promotional mix 
elements, a firm may reach its promotional objectives. Spending within the promotional 
mix varies by industry. Manufacturers of many business-to-business (B2B) products typically 
spend more on personal selling than on advertising because those products—such as a new 
telecommunications system—may require a significant investment. Consumer-goods market-
ers may focus more on advertising and sponsorships. Later sections of this chapter discuss 
how the parts of the mix contribute to effective promotion.

Chapter 13  Promotion and Pricing Strategies
431
Objectives of Promotional 
Strategy
Promotional strategy objectives vary among 
organizations. Some use promotion to expand their 
markets, and others use it to defend their current posi-
tions. As Figure 13.1 illustrates, common objectives 
include providing information, differentiating a prod-
uct, increasing sales, stabilizing sales, and accentuating 
a product’s value.
Marketers often pursue multiple promotional 
objectives at the same time. To promote its Microsoft 
Office software, Microsoft has to convince business 
owners, who buy the software, and their employees, 
who use the software, that the product is a worthwhile 
investment.
Marketers need to keep their firm’s promotional 
objectives in mind at all times. Sometimes the objec-
tives are obscured by a fast-paced, creative ad cam-
paign. In this case, the message—or worse, the brand 
name or image—is lost. The series of comic Geico 
ads that featured grumpy Neanderthals and the tag 
line “So easy a caveman could do it” were an instant 
hit. They were widely viewed on YouTube and even 
inspired a short-lived TV sitcom. But despite their 
quirky originality, the ads allowed humor to overtake the message; few viewers remembered 
the product—car insurance.
Providing Information A major portion of U.S. advertising is information ori-
ented. Credit card ads provide information about benefits and rates. Ads for hair-care prod-
ucts include information about benefits such as shine and volume. Ads for breakfast cereals 
often contain nutritional information. Television ads for prescription drugs, a nearly $2 
billion industry, are sometimes criticized for relying on emotional appeals rather than pro-
viding information about the causes, risk factors, and especially the prevention of disease.3 
But print advertisements for drugs often contain an entire page of warnings, side-effects, and 
usage guidelines.
Differentiating a Product Promotion can also be used to differentiate a firm’s 
offerings from the competition. Applying a concept called positioning, marketers attempt 
to establish their products in the minds of customers. The idea is to communicate to buyers 
meaningful distinctions about the attributes, price, quality, or use of a good or service.
When you set out to purchase a car, you have hundreds of brands from which to choose. 
How do you decide which one to buy? Carmakers do their best to differentiate their vehicles 
by style, performance, safety features, and price. They must make their vehicles stand out 
to individual consumers. General Motors intends its new Cheverolet Cruze compact car to 
replace the discontinued Cobalt model. Traditionally, compact cars have been less expen-
sive than midsize cars but also have reputations for mediocrity. The Cruze costs more than 
the Cobalt, but GM is promoting its higher quality and—especially—its high-quality safety 
engineering and safety features. A version of the Cruze has been on sale in other countries

for a few years and received the highest crash-safety score ever in the European New Car 
Assessment Program.4
Increasing Sales Increasing sales volume is the most common objective of a 
promotional strategy. Naturalizer became the third-largest seller of women’s dress shoes 
by appealing to Baby Boomers. But as these women have grown older, they have bought 
fewer pairs of shoes each year. Naturalizer wants to keep these customers but also attract 
the younger generation. So the firm developed a new line of trendy shoes. The promotional 
strategy included ads in magazines read by younger women—such as Elle and Marie Claire—
featuring young women in beach attire and Naturalizer shoes. The response to this strategy 
was a substantial increase in Naturalizer’s sales through department stores.
Stabilizing Sales Sales stabilization is another goal of promotional strategy. 
Firms often use sales contests during slack periods, motivating salespeople by offering prizes 
such as vacations, TVs, smart phones, and cash to those who meet certain goals. Companies 
distribute sales promotion materials—such as calendars, pens, and notepads—to customers 
to stimulate sales during the off-season. Jiffy Lube puts that little sticker on your windshield 
to remind you when to have your car’s next oil change—the regular visits help stabilize sales. 
A stable sales pattern brings several advantages. It evens out the production cycle, reduces 
some management and production costs, and simplifies financial, purchasing, and marketing 
planning. An effective promotional strategy can contribute to these goals.
McDonald’s came up with the new mocha- and caramel-flavor McFrappés iced drinks 
in its campaign to boost coffee sales in the summer. The marketing campaign in San Diego 
features multilayered advertising. Seventy taxis got new “extension tops” for greater prod-
uct visibility. They show a two-dimensional image of a McFrappé—with the foamy topping 
actually emerging from the taxi top. On the back of each taxi receipt is a printed coupon 
inviting taxi passengers to “Buy one McFrappé, get one free.” Almost 400 taxi drivers will 
have the coupons to hand out to their customers; the 118 local individual McDonald’s own-
ers are hoping the coupons will help boost their sales.5
Accentuating the Product’s Value Some promotional strategies enhance 
product values by explaining hidden benefits of ownership. Carmakers offer long-term war-
ranty programs; life insurance companies promote certain policies as investments. The cre-
ation of brand awareness and brand loyalty also enhances a product’s image and increases its 
desirability. Advertising with luxurious images supports the reputation of premium brands 
like Jaguar, Tiffany, and Rolex.
Promotional Planning
Today’s marketers can promote their products in many ways, and the lines between the 
different elements of the promotional mix are blurring. Consider the practice of product 
placement. A growing number of marketers pay placement fees to have their products show-
cased in various media, ranging from newspapers and magazines to television and movies. 
Coca-Cola gets prominent placement on American Idol, for instance, and The Tonight Show 
with Jay Leno and Extreme Makeover: Home Edition are other popular shows with high product-
placement appeal.6 Product and brand placements have skyrocketed with the increasing num-
ber of reality TV shows and with improving technology that allows viewers to fast forward 
through conventional, stand-alone commercials. NBC’s reality show The Biggest Loser had the 
highest number of product placements—more than 6,200—in one recent season. American Idol 
was second, with more than 4,600. The industry report Product Placement Spending in Media

Another type of promotional planning must be considered by firms with small budgets. 
Guerrilla marketing is innovative, low-cost marketing efforts designed to get consumers’ 
attention in unusual ways. Guerrilla marketing is an increasingly popular tactic for marketers, 
especially those with limited promotional budgets. The Coca-Cola Company recently maxi-
mized a humorous guerrilla marketing effort by combining it with social media marketing. 
How many times have you tried to get a snack or a drink from a vending machine, only to 
have the machine keep your change, or worse, not give you your requested item? A vending 
machine at St. John’s University in Queens, New York, was apparently broken. It gave the 
student customer a Coke—and then another, and another, and another. The pleased student 
handed out the unexpected bonus drinks, getting huge smiles from other students. The whole 
incident was filmed, guerrilla style, and posted on YouTube. It quickly went viral as viewers 
tweeted and blogged about it and sent the link to their friends.8
Marketers for larger companies have caught on and are using guerrilla approaches as 
well, with mixed success. The computer-game maker Electronic Arts (EA) faced an unusual 
challenge in marketing its videogame “Dante’s Inferno,” based on the first part of Dante 
Alighieri’s medieval epic poem The Divine Comedy. In a survey EA conducted before start-
ing its campaign, it found that fewer than 20 percent of those questioned knew anything 
about the “Inferno” besides the name. Not only did EA have to generate excitement about 
the game, it also had to educate prospective buyers about the poem. Dante assigned sin-
ners to one of nine regions, or circles, of hell according to their sins. The circles descended 
from lust, gluttony, greed, and so on, down to treachery, the worst sin, in the lowest circle. 
The company’s campaign, Nine Months of Hell, took as its theme Dante’s imagined struc-
ture as adapted to EA’s gaming needs. The campaign got off to a rocky start in the form of

staged, phony protests against the game by phony religious groups. Although the protests 
were quickly unmasked as a hoax, they set up negative expectations about the rest of the 
campaign. Things went from bad to worse with the next circle, lust. The blatantly sexist “Sin 
to Win” contest at ComicCon, the biggest comic-book and gaming convention in the coun-
try, outraged female gamers—a large portion of the market—who already felt alienated and 
ignored by the gaming industry. The marketers apologized, learned from their mistakes, and 
tried for a somewhat more intellectual—though still edgy—approach. Phil Marineau, the 
senior product manager for the game, said, “ ‘Sin to Win’ was a great eye-opener for us, and 
we’re glad it happened early on, so we could learn from it.” In the end, the campaign was 
both praised and criticized within the marketing industry.9
From this overview of the promotional mix, we now turn to discussions of each of its 
elements. The following sections detail the major components of advertising, sales promo-
tion, personal selling, and public relations.
Advertising
Consumers receive from 4,000 to 5,000 marketing messages each day, many of them in 
the form of advertising.10 Advertising is the most visible form of nonpersonal promotion—and 
the most effective for many firms. Advertising refers to paid nonpersonal communication 
usually targeted at large numbers of potential buyers. Although U.S. citizens often think of 
advertising as a typically American function, it is a global activity. Procter & Gamble leads 
the list of global advertisers, with measured media spending of $9.73 billion. The firm devotes 
65 percent of that amount to advertising in international markets. The other members of the 
top ten are Unilever, L’Oréal, General Motors, Toyota, The Coca-Cola Company, Johnson 
& Johnson, Ford, Reckitt Benckiser, and Nestlé. Of the six non-U.S.-based companies that 
spend more than half of their advertising budgets in the United States, four are European-
based pharmaceutical firms. Pharmaceutical firms are forbidden to engage in direct-to-con-
sumer prescription-drug advertising in Europe but are free to do so in the United States.11
Advertising expenditures vary among industries, companies, and media. Automotive, 
retail, and telecommunications take top honors for spending in the United States—carmak-
ers spend a whopping $20 billion per year. Top car advertiser General Motors spent $3.6 
billion in one recent year.12 Because advertising expenditures are so great, and because con-
sumers are bombarded with so many messages, firms need to be more and more creative and 
efficient at getting consumers’ attention.
Types of Advertising
The two basic types of ads are product and institutional advertisements. Product adver-
tising consists of messages designed to sell a particular good or service. Advertisements 
for Nantucket Nectars juices, iPods, and Capital One credit cards are examples of product 
advertising. Institutional advertising involves messages that promote concepts, ideas, 
philosophies, or goodwill for industries, companies, organizations, or government entities. 
Each year, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation promotes its “Walk for the Cure” 
fund-raising event, and your college may place advertisements in local papers or news shows 
to promote its activities. As the “Hit & Miss” feature describes, Heritage Oaks Bank’s 
“Expect Success” campaign is an example of institutional advertising.
A form of institutional advertising that is growing in importance, cause advertising, 
promotes a specific viewpoint on a public issue as a way to influence public opinion and the

Heritage Oaks Bank is a community bank serving San Luís Obispo 
County on California’s Central Coast. The bank recently launched a 
new and different advertising campaign. Called “Expect Success,” the 
campaign highlights clients of the bank who have established personal 
and professional presences in the community.
The campaign takes the form of testimonials, giving the clients the 
opportunity to speak in their own words about their role models, the 
goals they have set for themselves, their favorite community moments, 
a saying they live by, and why Heritage Oaks Bank is their bank of 
choice. The bank advertises “Expect Success” in print and on television, 
with one-on-one interview testimonials available on its Web site. The 
campaign highlights a law firm partner, a furniture store owner, two 
winery owners, and a high-school sports coach, among others. 
One example is Alex Posada. For 30 years he has been the direc-
tor of parks and recreation for the city of Santa Maria. His role models 
were his parents. The goals he set for himself “include working to 
make the community a better place to live by taking an active part 
in community endeavors.” He lives by the saying, “Learn from your 
mistakes. Just don’t learn too much.” Posada is also a volunteer with 
the Special Olympics. His favorite community moment occurred when 
the Special Olympics Torch was carried through the area on its way to 
the Summer Games. He banks at Heritage Oaks because of the “con-
venience, excellent customer service, and community relations.” Mitch 
Massey, the bank’s senior vice president for marketing, says, “I have 
always felt that the best way to tell our company’s story is to have 
those who have grown their businesses, with our bank’s involvement, 
share their success story.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What message does Heritage Oaks Bank’s “Expect 
Success” campaign promote?
2. Imagine you are the marketing director for an institution 
such as a bank or a hospital. What message do you want 
to get across? How and where would you communicate 
it?

legislative process about issues such as literacy, hunger and poverty, and alternative 
energy sources. Both not-for-profit organizations and businesses use cause advertis-
ing, sometimes called advocacy advertising. As part of Avon’s corporate responsibility, 
the Avon Foundation promotes its Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program 
with celebrity endorsements from Reese Witherspoon in its advertising.13
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a not-for-profit organization dedi-
cated to raising public awareness and generating legislation and other efforts in 
the fight against poverty, lack of education, and disease. Funded through grants 
from the Gates fund and investment guru Warren Buffett, the foundation operates 
in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and more than 100 countries. Through 
well-publicized grants of $1.37 billion to the United Negro College fund for its 
Millennium Scholars Program and tours abroad to personally oversee vaccination 
programs, the Gates fund generates interest in their causes. For their efforts they 
received a recent Time Person of the Year award.14
Advertising and the Product Life Cycle
Both product and institutional advertising fall into one of three categories based 
on whether the ads are intended to inform, persuade, or remind. A firm uses infor-
mative advertising to build initial demand for a product in the introductory phase of 
the product life cycle. Highly publicized new-product entries attract the interest of 
potential buyers who seek information about the advantages of the new products 
over existing ones, warranties provided, prices, and places that offer the new prod-
ucts. Ads for new cell phones boast of new features, colors, designs, and pricing 
options to attract new customers.

Part 4  Marketing Management
Persuasive advertising attempts to improve the competitive status of a product, institution, 
or concept, usually in the growth and maturity stages of the product life cycle. One of the 
most popular types of persuasive product advertising, comparative advertising, compares prod-
ucts directly with their competitors—either by name or by inference. Tylenol advertisements 
mention the possible stomach problems that the generic drug aspirin could cause, stating 
that its pain reliever does not irritate the stomach. But advertisers need to be careful when 
they name competing brands in comparison ads because they might leave themselves open 
to controversy or even legal action by competitors. Notice that Tylenol does not mention a 
specific aspirin brand in its promotions.
Reminder-oriented advertising often appears in the late maturity or decline stages of the 
product life cycle to maintain awareness of the importance and usefulness of a product, 
concept, or institution. Triscuits have been around for a long time, but Nabisco attempts to 
mobilize sales with up-to-date advertising that appeals to health and fitness–conscious con-
sumers. The advertising mentions its new no-trans-fat formulations.
Advertising Media
Marketers must choose how to allocate their advertising budgets among various media. 
All media offer advantages and disadvantages. Cost is an important consideration in media 
selection, but marketers must also choose the media best suited for communicating their 
message. As Figure 13.2 indicates, the three leading media outlets for advertising are televi-
sion, newspapers, and magazines. However, Internet advertising is growing fast. Consumers 
now receive ads when they download news and other information to their hand-held wireless 
devices.
Advertising executives agree that firms need to rethink traditional 
ad campaigns to incorporate new media as well as updated uses of tradi-
tional media. Google is looking for ways to combine the targeting capa-
bilities of Internet advertising and the richness of the television medium. 
Google and Intel are working with the television manufacturer Sony to 
develop TVs and set-top boxes that allow viewers to navigate the Web, 
including social-networking sites such as Twitter. The software is based 
on Google’s Android operating system for its smart phones. Logitech is 
developing a remote control for the system, including a miniature key-
board.15 The project has advanced to the point where Google is testing 
a TV Web-search service with Dish Network Corp. Google is far from 
alone in the effort to bring television and the Web closer together. It 
faces stiff competition from Microsoft and Apple, among others.16
Television Television is still one of America’s leading national 
advertising media. Television advertising can be classified as network, 
national, local, and cable ads. The four major national networks—ABC, 
CBS, NBC, and Fox—along with the CW, broadcast almost one-fifth 
of all television ads. Despite a decline in audience share and growing 
competition from cable, network television remains the easiest way for 
advertisers to reach large numbers of viewers—10 million to 20 million 
with a single commercial. Automakers, fast-food restaurants, and food 
manufacturers are heavy users of network TV advertising.
About 58 percent of U.S. households with TVs now subscribe to 
cable, drawn to the more than 800  channels available through cable

or satellite services. But the cable and satellite networks are facing new competition. One 
survey indicates that 60 percent of American homes have one or more videogame consoles. 
People are using the consoles to download apps and video-on-demand offerings. And a small 
but growing number of viewers are discontinuing their cable service and opting for online 
services such as Netflix, Hulu, Apple’s iTunes, and the networks’ own Web sites. Recently, 
1.3 million people watched at least part of the Masters golf tournament online, double the 
number who did so the previous year. People still prefer free, advertising-supported down-
loads, although online network advertising made up only 2.5 percent of the yearly $62 bil-
lion in advertising revenues. However, the number of homes with digital video recorders 
(DVRs) and high-definition (HD) televisions is increasing steadily. Recent research suggests 
that even people who can use their DVRs to skip TV ads don’t always do so. According to 
the Nielsen Company, many DVR users still watch shows at their scheduled times, when 
they must watch the ads, and even those who record shows for later viewing watch almost 
half the ads they could skip. With more people watching playbacks of their favorite shows, 
the networks’ ratings—and commercial watching—increase too.17
Although—or perhaps because—television reaches the greatest number of consumers 
at once, it is the most expensive advertising medium. NBC’s Sunday Night Football has long 
been the most expensive regularly broadcast program of the fall season. A 30-second ad 
costs an average of almost $340,000. Super Bowl ads have been known to command prices 
of nearly $3 million for 30 seconds, but more recently, those spots sold for between $2.5 
million and $2.8 million.18 Marketers want to be certain that their commercials reach the 
greatest number of viewers. Because of the high cost, advertisers may demand guarantees 
of audience size and receive compensation if a show fails to deliver the promised number of 
viewers.
Newspapers Daily and weekly newspapers continue to dominate local advertising. 
Marketers can easily tailor newspaper advertising for local tastes and preferences. Advertisers 
can also coordinate advertisements with other promotional efforts such as discount coupons 
from supermarkets and one-day sales at department stores. A disadvantage comes from 
the relatively short life span; people usually discard their newspapers soon after reading. 
Retailers and automobile dealers rank first among newspaper advertisers. Most newspapers 
now maintain Web sites, some of which offer separate material and features, to complement 
their print editions.
Radio Despite the proliferation of other media, the average U.S. household owns 
five radios—including those in cars—a market penetration that makes radio an important 
advertising medium. Advertisers like the captive audience of listeners as they commute to 
and from work. As a result, morning and evening drive-time shows command top ad 
rates. In major markets, many stations serve different demographic groups with targeted 
programming. Internet radio programming also offers opportunities for yet more focused 
targeting.
Satellite stations offer great potential for advertisers. Sirius and XM both offer com-
mercial-free music, with advertising on news and talk shows. A recent study predicts that 
Internet radio will have 185 million listeners by 2020, although 250 million will still listen to 
AM/FM (sometimes referred to as terrestrial) radio. Internet advertising revenues reached 
$260 million in a year, with an additional $28 million from podcasting.19 Google recently 
updated its AdWords application to include ads that can be broadcast by traditional radio 
stations. An advertiser fills out a questionnaire indicating the target audience and where and 
how often the ad should be run. The advertiser pays a fee each time the ad is aired and can 
have the ad tracked to find the best possible time to reach the desired audience.20

Part 4  Marketing Management
Magazines Magazines include consumer publications and business trade journals. 
Time, Reader’s Digest, and Sports Illustrated are consumer magazines, whereas Advertising Age 
and Oil & Gas Journal fall into the trade category.
Magazines may customize their publications and target advertising messages to different 
regions of the country. One method places local advertising in regional editions of the maga-
zines. Other magazines attach wraparounds—half-size covers on top of full-size covers—to 
highlight articles inside that relate to particular areas; different wraparounds appear in differ-
ent parts of the country.
Magazines are a natural choice for targeted advertising. Media buyers study demograph-
ics of subscribers and select magazines that attract the desired readers. American Express 
advertises in Fortune and Forbes to reach businesspeople, while PacSun clothes and Clearasil 
skin medications are advertised in teenVogue.
Direct Mail The average U.S. household receives about 550 pieces of direct mail 
each year, including 100 catalogs. The huge growth in the variety of direct-mail offerings 
combined with the convenience they offer today’s busy, time-pressed shoppers has made 
direct-mail advertising a multibillion-dollar business. Even consumers who like to shop 
online often page through a catalog before placing an online order. Although direct mail is 
expensive per person, a small business can afford a limited direct-mail campaign but not a 
television or radio ad. For businesses with a small advertising budget, a carefully targeted 
direct-mail effort can be highly effective. E-mail is a low-cost form of direct marketing. 
Marketers can target the most interested Internet users by offering Web site visitors an 
option to register to receive e-mail. Companies like Amazon.com, Spring Hill Nurseries, 
and Abercrombie & Fitch routinely send e-mails to regular customers.
Address lists are at the heart of direct-mail advertising. Using data-mining techniques to 
segment markets, direct-mail marketers create profiles that show the traits of consumers who are 
likely to buy their products or donate to their organizations. Catalog retailers sometimes experi-
ment by sending direct-mail pieces randomly to people who subscribe to particular magazines. 
Next, they analyze the orders received from the mailings and develop profiles of purchasers. 
Finally, they rent lists of additional subscriber names that match the profiles they have developed.
Studies have shown that most U.S. consumers are annoyed by the amount of so-called 
“junk mail” they receive every day, including catalogs, advertising postcards, and flyers. 
Among Internet users, a major pet peeve is spam, or junk e-mail. Many states have outlawed 
such practices as sending e-mail promotions without legitimate return addresses, although it 
is difficult to track down and catch offenders.
The Direct Marketing Association (DMA; www.the-dma.org) helps marketers combat 
negative attitudes by offering its members guidelines on ethical business practices. The 
DMA also provides consumer information at its Web site, as well as services that enable 
consumers to opt out of receiving unsolicited offers. In addition, Federal Trade Commission 
regulations have taken effect for direct mail in certain industries. Now when you receive that 
unsolicited, preapproved credit card application in the mail, it must be accompanied by a 
prominent notice telling you how to get off the bank’s mailing list. This law will affect mil-
lions of consumers. In the period from 2004 to 2007, more than 7 billion credit card offers 
were mailed. That rate plummeted during the recession, falling to about 2 billion overall, 
but increased during the fourth quarter of that year. Consumers can also opt out of receiving 
such offers for five years.21

in advertising expenditures.22 The majority of spending on outdoor advertising is for

billboards, but spending for other types of outdoor advertising, 
such as signs in transit stations, stores, airports, and sports sta-
diums, is growing fast. Advertisers are exploring new forms of 
outdoor media, many of which involve technology: computer-
ized paintings, video billboards, “trivision” that displays three 
revolving images on a single billboard, and moving billboards 
mounted on trucks. Other innovations include ads displayed on 
the Goodyear blimp, using an electronic system that offers ani-
mation and video. 
Chicago’s North Park University launched an outdoor 
advertising campaign featuring current students. The advertis-
ing invited viewers to a Web site where those students dis-
cussed how their education at North Park affected their lives. 
Digital advertising will soon be available on taxi tops. With 
almost 13,000 yellow medallion taxis in New York City alone, 
the potential visibility is enormous. Clear Channel Outdoor 
Advertising offers its Digital Outdoor Networks, a complete 
line of electronic advertising.23 CBS Outdoor recently unveiled 
the first-ever high-definition, 3D projection display in New York City’s Grand Central 
Station. And The Coca-Cola Company inaugurated its Digital Network, 28 electronic bill-
boards that it owns in 27 locations. (The company leases the space from outdoor advertising 
firms such as Clear Channel Outdoor and Boardworks but owns the boards themselves.) Its 
first advertising on the billboards was a promotion of its special-edition Daytona 500 Coke 
cans. The Outdoor Advertising Association of America predicts that several hundred digital 
billboards will be introduced each year, with a total of 1,800 so far.24 Outdoor advertising 
suffers from several disadvantages, however. The medium requires brief messages, and bill-
boards are often attacked by preservation and conservation groups.
Internet Advertising Sales from online advertising and marketing now surpass 
sales from print media. Companies spend almost $120 billion on advertising in online and 
digital media and almost $112 billion on advertising in newspapers and magazines.25 Search 
engine marketing, display ads, and even classified ads are surging.
Online and interactive media have already changed the nature of advertising. Starting 
with simple banner ads, Internet advertising has become much more complex and sophis-
ticated. Miniature television screen images, called widgets or gadgets, can carry marketing 
messages only a few inches high on a Web site, blog, or desktop display. And they contain 
embedded links to their home sites. Online advertising can take other forms as well. Ford 
Motor Company’s Fiesta subcompact was available in Europe but not in the United States. 
To educate the American public about the Fiesta, soon to become available, the company 
launched its Fiesta Movement by giving 100 consumers European Fiestas for six months 
and having them use the cars to complete various missions each month. (Ford paid for the 
gas.) Some people used the cars for charitable work, such as delivering Meals On Wheels. 
Others used them for real adventures or even for actually eloping. As part of the project, the 
consumers documented their missions and posted the results on YouTube, Flickr, Facebook, 
and Twitter. In the next phase of the Fiesta Movement, consumers will compete for cash 
prizes and the chance to win a Fiesta of their own. Google, which owns YouTube, predicts 
that the Web site will soon be in the black for the first time. Advertising on YouTube was 
nearly sold out. Eric Schmidt, Google’s CEO, predicted that more advertisers would use 
YouTube in their ad campaigns. He said that YouTube “has gone from being a nice to have 
to an essential part of the media mix of any display campaign.”26

Part 4  Marketing Management
Another example is viral advertising, which creates a message that is novel or entertain-
ing enough for consumers to forward it to others, spreading it like a virus. The great advan-
tage is that spreading the word online, which often relies on social networking on sites like 
MySpace and Facebook, costs the advertiser nothing. While viral marketing can be risky, 
the best campaigns are edgy and often funny. Among the most effective viral video ads of 
late were “Will It Blend?” which depicts what happens when an iPhone meets a blender; 
T-Mobile Dance, a film of a dancing flash mob in London’s Liverpool Street Railway 
Station; and “United Breaks Guitars,” about a member of the band Sons of Maxwell, his gui-
tar, and United Airlines.27
Some viral campaigns rely on personal word-of-mouth promotions, and when ordinary 
consumers are recruited as “brand ambassadors” or “buzz agents” for pay, questions can arise 
about ethics. One company, BzzAgent, gives its members products instead of money. But 
these ambassadors are not required to tell others that they’re being paid or receiving free 
gifts to discuss products, which some view as problematic.28
Sponsorship One of the hottest trends in promotion offers marketers the ability to 
integrate several elements of the promotional mix. Sponsorship involves providing funds for 
a sporting or cultural event in exchange for a direct association with the event. Sports sponsor-
ships attract two-thirds of total sponsorship dollars in the United States alone. Entertainment, 
festivals, causes, and the arts divide up the remaining third of sponsorship dollars.
NASCAR, the biggest spectator sport in the United States, thrives on sponsorships. 
Because it can cost as much as $20 to $25 million a year to run a top NASCAR team, drivers 
depend on sponsorships from companies to keep the wheels turning. Some companies were 
unwilling or unable to continue their sponsorships.29 Firms may also sponsor charitable or 
other not-for-profit awards or events. In conjunction with sports network ESPN, Gatorade 
sponsors its High School Athlete of the Year award, presented to the top male and female 
high school athletes who “strive for their best on and off the field.”
Sponsors benefit in two major ways: exposure to the event’s audience and association 
with the image of the activity. If a celebrity is involved, sponsors usually earn the right to use 
his or her name along with the name of the event in advertisements. They can set up signs at 
the event, offer sales promotions, and the like. Sponsorships play an important role in rela-
tionship marketing, bringing together the event, its participants, and the sponsoring firms.
Other Media Options As consumers filter out familiar advertising messages, 
marketers look for novel ways to catch their attention. In addition to the major media, firms 
promote through many other vehicles such as infomercials and specialized media. 
Infomercials are a form of broadcast direct marketing, also called direct-response television 
(DRTV). These 30-minute programs resemble regular television programs but are devoted 
to selling goods or services such as exercise equipment, skin-care products, or kitchenware. 
The long format allows an advertiser to thoroughly present product benefits, increase aware-
ness, and make an impact on consumers. Advertisers also receive immediate responses in 
the form of sales or inquiries because most infomercials feature toll-free phone numbers. 
Infomercial stars may become celebrities in their own right, attracting more customers 
wherever they go. The most effective infomercials tend to be for auto-care products, beauty 
and personal-care items, investing and business opportunities, collectibles, fitness and self-
improvement products, and housewares and electronics.30
Advertisers use just about any medium they can find. They place messages on New 
York City MetroCard transit cards and toll receipts on the Massachusetts Turnpike. A more 
recent development is the use of ATMs for advertising. Some ATMs can play 15-second

commercials on their screens, and many can print advertising messages on receipts. An ATM 
screen has a captive audience because the user must watch the screen to complete a transac-
tion. Directory advertising includes the familiar Yellow Pages listings in telephone books and 
thousands of other types of directories, most presenting business-related promotions. Besides 
local and regional directories, publishers also have produced special printed and online ver-
sions of the Yellow Pages that target ethnic groups.
Sales Promotion
Traditionally viewed as a supplement to a firm’s sales or advertising efforts, sales promo-
tion has emerged as an integral part of the promotional mix. Promotion now accounts for 
more than half as many marketing dollars as are spent on advertising, and promotion spend-
ing is rising faster than ad spending. Sales promotion consists of forms of promotion such 
as coupons, product samples, and rebates that support advertising and personal selling.
Both retailers and manufacturers use sales promotions to offer consumers extra incen-
tives to buy. Beyond the short-term advantage of increased sales, sales promotions can also 
help marketers build brand equity and enhance customer relationships. Examples include 
samples, coupons, contests, displays, trade shows, and dealer incentives.
Consumer-Oriented Promotions
The goal of a consumer-oriented sales promotion is to get new and existing custom-
ers to try or buy products. In addition, marketers want to encourage repeat purchases by 
rewarding current users, increase sales of complimentary products, 
and boost impulse purchases. Figure 13.3 shows how marketers 
allocate their consumer-oriented spending among the categories of 
promotions.
Promotions can also popularize an idea, such as the growing 
awareness of how much pollution plastic shopping bags contrib-
ute to the environment. The “Going Green” feature discusses the 
growing trend of banning plastic shopping bags.
Premiums, Coupons, Rebates, and 
Samples Nearly six of every ten sales promotion dollars are 
spent on premiums—items given free or at a reduced price with the 
purchase of another product. Cosmetics companies such as Clinique 
offer sample kits with purchases of their products. Fast-food restau-
rants are also big users of premiums. McDonald’s and Burger King 
include a toy with every children’s meal—the toys often tie in with 
new movies or popular cartoon shows. In general, marketers choose 
premiums that are likely to get consumers thinking about and caring 
about the brand and the product. People who purchase health foods 
at a grocery store may find an offer for a free personal training ses-
sion at a local health club printed on the back of their sales receipt.
Customers redeem coupons for small price discounts when they 
purchase the promoted products. Such offers may persuade a cus-
tomer to try a new or different product. Some large supermarket

How Much Would You Pay for a Plastic Shopping Bag?
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that almost 
4 billion tons of plastics waste—in the form of bags, sacks, and wrap-
ping—were generated in one year. Made from foreign oil, the plastic 
can take 1,000 years to degrade. Only about 1 percent is ever recycled.
A growing number of people want to reduce these statistics. For 
instance, San Francisco enacted an outright ban on plastic bags. New 
York City started requiring certain retailers to accept plastic bags for 
recycling. Los Angeles also banned plastic bags. In a first, Washington, 
D.C., imposed a tax of 5 cents on every plastic bag for supermarket 
customers. The city plans to use the revenue to restore a polluted local 
river.
But such laws have not always met with approval. In eco-friendly 
Seattle, voters overturned a law charging 20 cents per plastic bag, 
perhaps because they were already recycling and reusing the bags. 
The mayor of Washington, D.C., hopes that the tax on plastic bags will 
encourage shoppers to change their habits so they won’t have to pay 
the tax at all.
The retailing giant Walmart already sells reusable bags for 
50 cents. In three of its California stores, it is introducing the option 
of a 15 cent reusable bag that is expected to survive 75 shopping trips. 
The bag can then be recycled in existing bins in the stores. 
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Can stores that provide eco-friendly shopping bags or 
other ways to reduce the polluting effects of plastic reap 
promotional benefits from their efforts? How can cities 
that ban or tax plastic bags promote their actions?
2. What other ways can you think of to promote the idea of 
recycling plastic bags or reducing their use?

chains double the face value of manufacturers’ coupons. Coupons have the disadvantage of 
focusing customers on price rather than brand loyalty. While some consumers complain that 
clipping or printing out coupons is too time consuming, others relish the savings, particu-
larly when money is tight and prices seem to be high. 
American consumers’ use of coupons increased 27 percent in a year, using 3.3 billion 
coupons to redeem $3.5 billion. Internet coupon use skyrocketed a whopping 360 percent. 
Marketers issued 367 billion coupons with a face value averaging $1.44, but shortened the 
expiration periods by some 10 percent. Some analysts predict that the growing use of paper-
less mobile coupons, which consumers can access on their Web-enabled cellphones while 
shopping and pioneered by such retailers as Target, could soon make clippable or even 
printed-out coupons obsolete.31
Rebates offer cash back to consumers who mail in required proofs of purchase. Rebates 
help packaged-goods manufacturers increase purchase rates, promote multiple purchases, 
and reward product users. Other types of companies also offer rebates, especially for elec-
tronics, computers and their accessories, and automobiles. Processing rebates gives market-
ers a way to collect data about their customers, but many shoppers find it inconvenient to 
collect the required receipts, forms, and UPC codes and then wait several weeks for their 
refund. Services such as RebateRemedy can cut the waiting time to days instead of weeks 
but take a 20 to 30 percent cut of the rebate, plus a processing fee. Some stores and manu-
facturers are phasing out mail-in rebates. After a brief period of testing mail-in rebates on 
some cell phones, Verizon found that customers preferred and expected instant online dis-
counts, so the company has ended its mail-in rebate program on the Palm Pre and the 
Pixi Plus.32

moisturizer, a bar of soap, or a packet of laundry detergent. Three of every four consumers 
who receive samples will try them.
Games, Contests, and Sweepstakes Contests, sweepstakes, and games 
offer cash, merchandise, or travel as prizes to participating winners. Firms often spon-
sor these activities to introduce new goods and services and to attract additional custom-
ers. Games and contests require entrants to solve problems or write essays and sometimes 
provide proof of purchase. Sweepstakes choose winners by chance and require no product 
purchase. Consumers typically prefer them because games and contests require more effort. 
Companies like sweepstakes, too, because they are inexpensive to run and determine the 
number of winners from the beginning. With games and contests, the company cannot pre-
dict the number of people who will correctly complete a puzzle or gather the right number 
of symbols from scratch-off cards. Sweepstakes, games, and contests can reinforce a com-
pany’s image and advertising message, but consumer attention may focus on the promotion 
rather than the product.
In recent years, court rulings and legal restrictions have limited the use of games and 
contests. Companies must proceed carefully in advertising their contests and games and the 
prizes they award. Marketers must indicate the chances of winning and avoid false promises 
such as implying that a person has already won.
Specialty Advertising Do you have any pens, T-shirts, or refrigerator magnets 
imprinted with a business name that you received for free? These offers are examples of 
specialty advertising or advertising specialties. This type of sales promotion involves the gift 
of useful merchandise carrying the name, logo, or slogan of a profit-seeking business or a not-
for-profit organization. Because those products are useful and sometimes personalized with 
recipients’ names, people tend to keep and use them, giving advertisers repeated exposure. 
Originally designed to identify and create goodwill for advertisers, advertising specialties now 
generate sales leads and develop traffic for stores and trade show exhibitors. Like premiums, 
these promotions should reinforce the brand’s image and its relationship with the recipient.
Trade-Oriented Promotions
Sales promotion techniques can also contribute to campaigns directed to retailers and 
wholesalers. Trade promotion is sales promotion geared to marketing intermediaries rather 
than to consumers. Marketers use trade promotion to encourage retailers to stock new prod-
ucts, continue carrying existing ones, and promote both new and existing products effectively 
to consumers. Successful trade promotions offer financial incentives. They require careful 
timing, attention to costs, and easy implementation for intermediaries. These promotions 
should bring quick results and improve retail sales. Major trade promotions include point-of-
purchase advertising and trade shows.
Point-of-purchase (POP) advertising consists of displays or demonstrations that 
promote products when and where consumers buy them, such as in retail stores. When the 
Swiffer floor cleaner was being introduced, Procter & Gamble used in-store demonstrations 
to show consumers how it worked. Marketing research has shown that consumers are more 
likely to purchase certain products when such displays are present. Sunscreen, painting sup-
plies, and snacks are typically displayed this way. A high-tech version of POP advertising is 
digital advertising consoles mounted on grocery carts. With impulse purchases making up 
53 percent of total buying, POP has already begun to evolve into what is being called 
“mobile advertising.” Although privacy is still an issue, more and more Web sites and other

services are now able to locate Internet users, 
and location-based mobile spending is expected 
to increase from a current $34 million to $4 bil-
lion in 2015. About 25 percent of the 500 million 
Facebook members open the site via mobile elec-
tronic devices. Location-based advertising will not 
be directed primarily to stationary computers but 
to smart phones, iPads, Kindles, game consoles, 
and automobiles.33
Manufacturers and other sellers often exhibit 
at trade shows to promote goods or services to 
members of their distribution channels. These 
shows are often organized by industry trade associ-
ations. Each year, thousands of trade shows attract 
millions of exhibitors and hundreds of millions of 
attendees. Such shows are particularly important 
in fast-changing industries like those for com-
puters, toys, furniture, and fashions. The annual 
Consumer Electronics Show, which is held in Las 
Vegas and attracts more than 100,000 visitors, is 
the nation’s largest. But shows in the medical and 
healthcare, RV and camping, and even woodwork-
ing machinery fields remain strong. These shows 
are especially effective for introducing new prod-
ucts and generating sales leads.
Personal Selling
Many companies consider personal selling—a 
person-to-person promotional presentation to a 
potential buyer—the key to marketing effective-
ness. Unless a seller matches a firm’s goods or 
services to the needs of a particular client or cus-
tomer, none of the firm’s other activities produces 
any benefits. Today, sales and sales-related jobs 
employ about 16 million U.S. workers.34 Businesses 
often spend five to ten times as much on personal 
selling as on advertising. Given the significant cost 
of hiring, training, benefits, and salaries, businesses 
are very concerned with the effectiveness of their 
sales personnel. One of their continuing concerns 
is with the way representatives communicate with 
others. The “Business Etiquette” feature discusses 
how to negotiate during difficult economic times.
How do marketers decide whether to make 
personal selling the primary component of their 
firm’s marketing mix? In general, firms are likely 
to emphasize personal selling rather than advertis-
ing or sales promotion under four conditions:
How to Negotiate in a Difficult Economy
Despite the arrival of electronic media, many businesses still rely on personal 
selling. Even when the economy is weak, you can still ﬁ nd ways to negotiate 
effectively. Here are ﬁ ve tips for successful negotiation in good and difﬁ cult 
economic times:
1 
Be a good listener. This is always a good idea. Like good detectives, good 
negotiators ask questions—and then listen as the other negotiator or 
prospect speaks. You’ll establish trust—and learn whether your proposal 
will meet your prospect’s needs.
2 
Be prepared. Before you negotiate, do as much research as possible on your 
prospect, the prospect’s business, what effect the economy has on his or 
her industry, and so on. Preparation is the only part of negotiation that is 
completely within your control.
3 
Be patient. Americans seem always to be in a hurry, whereas in Asia, 
South America, or the Middle East, people realize that if you rush, you 
may make mistakes. Taking your time may also give you a psychological 
advantage over the other negotiator.
4 
Decide what is important to you. What can you absolutely not do without? What 
would you be willing to give up, if you must compromise?
5 
Keep your options open. If you feel you can’t make a satisfactory agreement 
even with the best of intentions, leave yourself the option of walking 
away.

1. Customers are relatively few in number and geographically concentrated.
2. The product is technically complex, involves trade-ins, or requires special handling.
3. The product carries a relatively high price.
4. It moves through direct-distribution channels.
Selling Piper Cub airplanes is a good example. Customers tend to be wealthy people 
who value their freedom and privacy, not to mention the luxury of having their own plane. 
“It is a way of life I am selling,” says veteran sales rep Bruce Keller, “not just aluminum. I 
want the customer to share that with me. If you look at my airplane and you sit in it, you are 
going flying.”35
The sales functions of most companies are experiencing rapid change. Today’s sales-
people are more concerned with establishing long-term buyer–seller relationships and acting 
as consultants to their customers than in the past. In the aftermath of the recession, sales-
people face a new challenge—consumers who haggle over prices, even on retail items. One 
survey found that 88 percent of those questioned had haggled over at least one price in the 
preceding six months. Unlike in the Great Depression of the 1930s, the last time Americans 
engaged in serious amounts of haggling, today’s consumers have advantages that would 
astound their predecessors. Anyone with a Web-enabled cell phone can Google compet-
ing prices of merchandise while standing in front of it in a retail store. Many have learned 
to bargain via Web sites such as eBay or have used Priceline to negotiate deals on travel. 
The survey found that hagglers had better than a 75 percent success rate in making deals on 
clothing, appliances, and jewelry. Consumers who negotiated medical bills were successful 
58 percent of the time.36
Personal selling can occur in several environments, each of which can involve business-
to-business or business-to-consumer selling. Sales representatives who make sales calls on 
prospective customers at their businesses are involved in field selling. Companies that sell 
major industrial equipment typically rely heavily on field selling. Over-the-counter selling 
describes sales activities in retailing and some wholesale locations, where customers visit the 
seller’s facility to purchase items. Telemarketing sales representatives make their presentations 
over the phone. A later section reviews telemarketing in more detail.
Sales Tasks All sales activities involve assisting customers in some manner. 
Although a salesperson’s work can vary significantly from one company or situation to 
another, it usually includes a mix of three basic tasks: order processing, creative selling, and 
missionary selling.
Order Processing Although both field selling and telemarketing involve this 
activity, order processing is most often related to retail and wholesale firms. The sales-
person identifies customer needs, points out merchandise to meet them, and processes the 
order. Route sales personnel process orders for such consumer goods as bread, milk, soft 
drinks, and snack foods. They check each store’s stock, report inventory needs to the store 
manager, and complete the sale. Most of these jobs include at least minor order-processing 
functions.
Creative Selling Sales representatives for most business products and some con-
sumer items perform creative selling, a persuasive type of promotional presentation. 
Creative selling promotes a good or service whose benefits are not readily apparent or whose 
purchase decision requires a close analysis of alternatives. Sales of intangible products such 
as insurance rely heavily on creative selling, but sales of tangible goods benefit as well.

Part 4  Marketing Management
Many retail salespeople just process orders, but many consumers are looking for more in 
the form of customer service, which is where creative selling comes in. Trained sales staff at 
Talbots women’s clothing stores hold seasonal wardrobe-building workshops at the stores, 
helping customers select and purchase coordinating clothing, accessories, and shoes from the 
Talbots line—which they might not have purchased without such advice.
Missionary Selling Sales work also includes an indirect form of selling in which 
the representative promotes goodwill for a company or provides technical or operational 
assistance to the customer; this practice is called missionary selling. Many businesses that 
sell technical equipment, such as Oracle and Fujitsu, provide systems specialists who act as 
consultants to customers. These salespeople work to solve problems and sometimes help 
their clients with questions not directly related to their employers’ products. Other indus-
tries also use missionary selling techniques. Pharmaceutical company representatives—called 
detailers—visit physicians to describe the firm’s latest offerings, although some firms are find-
ing success with more subtle methods, including Web-based sales calls outside office hours. 
The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer recently cut back its sales force and has increasingly turned 
to electronic marketing. The company has found electronic detailing especially advanta-
geous. With it, doctors can get the latest information on drugs when and where they choose. 
It also can be strictly controlled, and the company runs much less risk of its salespeople’s 
being accused of marketing drugs for off-label uses—that is, for treating conditions other 
than those they were originally intended to help.37 The actual sales, in any case, are handled 
through pharmacies, which fill the prescriptions.
Telemarketing Telemarketing, personal selling conducted by telephone, provides 
a firm’s marketers with a high return on their expenditures, an immediate response, and an 
opportunity for personalized two-way conversation. Many firms use telemarketing because 
expense or other obstacles prevent salespeople from meeting many potential customers in 
person. Telemarketers can use databases to target prospects based on demographic data. 
Telemarketing takes two forms. A sales representative who calls you is practicing outbound 
telemarketing. On the other hand, inbound telemarketing occurs when you call a toll-free 
phone number to get product information or place an order.
Outbound telemarketers must abide by the Federal Trade Commission’s 1996 
Telemarketing Sales Rule. Telemarketers must disclose that they are selling something and 
on whose behalf they are calling before they make their presentations. The rule also limits 
calls to between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m., requires sellers to disclose details on exchange poli-
cies, and requires them to keep lists of people who do not want to receive calls. In some 
states, it is also against the law for telemarketers to leave messages on consumers’ answering 
machines. Congress enacted another law in 2003 creating the National Do Not Call registry 
intended to help consumers block unwanted telemarketing calls. Consumers who want to be 
on the list must call a special number or visit a Web site to register. Telemarketers must stop 
calling registered numbers within 31 days or face stiff fines of up to $11,000 for each viola-
tion.38 Charities, surveys, and political campaign calls are exempt from these restrictions. 
Businesses with which consumers already have a relationship, such as the bank where they 
have accounts or the dealership where they buy their cars, may conduct telemarketing calls 
under the guidelines of the Telemarketing Sales Rule.
The Sales Process The sales process typically follows the seven-step sequence 
shown in Figure 13.4: prospecting and qualifying, the approach, presentation, the demon-
stration, handling objections, closing, and the follow-up. Remember the importance of flexi-
bility, though; a good salesperson is not afraid to vary the sales process based on a customer’s 
responses and needs. The process of selling to a potential customer who is unfamiliar with a

company’s products differs from the process of serv-
ing a long-time customer.
Prospecting, Qualifying, and 
Approaching At the prospecting stage, salespeo-
ple identify potential customers. They may seek leads 
for prospective sales from such sources as existing 
customers, friends and family, and business associates. 
The qualifying process identifies potential customers 
who have the financial ability and authority to buy.
Companies use different tactics to identify and 
qualify prospects. Some companies rely on business 
development teams to do this legwork. They use the 
responses from direct mail to provide leads to sales 
reps. Other companies believe in personal visits from 
sales representatives; others use e-mail, which is inex-
pensive and boasts a good response rate. Many B2B 
firms are taking advantage of electronic social media 
such as electronic newsletters, Web events, virtual 
trade shows, podcasts, videos, online demonstrations, 
blogs, and many others.39
Successful salespeople make careful preparations, 
analyzing available data about a prospective cus-
tomer’s product lines and other pertinent information 
before making the initial contact. They realize the 
importance of a first impression in influencing a cus-
tomer’s future attitudes toward the selling company 
and its products.
Presentation and Demonstration At 
the presentation stage, salespeople communicate 
promotional messages. They may describe the major 
features of their products, highlight the advantages, and cite examples of satisfied consumers. 
A demonstration helps reinforce the message that the salesperson has been communicating—a 
critical step in the sales process. Department-store shoppers can get a free makeover at the 
cosmetics counter. Anyone looking to buy a car will take it for a test drive before deciding 
whether to purchase it.
Some products are too large to transport to prospective buyers or require special instal-
lation to demonstrate. Using laptop computers, multimedia presentations, graphic programs 
like SmartDraw, Web conferences, and even podcasts, sales representatives can demonstrate 
these products for customers.40 Others, such as services, are intangible. So a presentation 
including testimonials from satisfied customers or graphs illustrating results may be helpful.
Handling Objections Some salespeople fear potential customers’ objections 
because they view the questions as criticism. But a good salesperson can use objections as an 
opportunity to answer questions and explain how the product will benefit the customer. As a 
general rule, the key is to sell benefits, not features: How will this product help the customer?
Closing The critical point in the sales process—the time at which the salesperson 
actually asks the prospect to buy—is the closing. If the presentation effectively matches

product benefits to customer needs, the closing should be a natural conclusion. If there 
are more bumps in the process, the salesperson can try some different techniques, such as 
offering alternative products, offering a special incentive for purchase, or restating the 
product benefits. Closing the sale—and beginning a relationship in which the customer 
builds loyalty to the brand or product—is the ideal outcome of this interaction. But even 
if the sale is not made at this time, the salesperson should regard the interaction as the 
beginning of a potential relationship anyway. The prospect might very well become a 
customer in the future.
Follow-Up A salesperson’s actions after the sale may determine whether the cus-
tomer will make another purchase. Follow-up is an important part of building a long-lasting 
relationship. After closing, the salesperson should process the order efficiently. By calling 
soon after a purchase, the salesperson provides reassurance about the customer’s decision to 
buy and creates an opportunity to correct any problems.
Public Relations A final element of the promotional mix, public relations 
(PR)—including publicity—supports advertising, personal selling, and sales promotion, 
usually by pursuing broader objectives. Through PR, companies attempt to improve their 
prestige and image with the public by distributing specific messages or ideas to target 
audiences. Cause-related promotional activities are often supported by public relations and 
publicity campaigns. In addition, PR helps a firm establish awareness of goods and services 
and then builds a positive image of them.
Public relations refers to an organization’s communications and relationships with its 
various public audiences, such as customers, vendors, news media, employees, stockholders, the 
government, and the general public. Many of these communication efforts serve marketing 
purposes. Public relations is an efficient, indirect communications channel for promot-
ing products. It can publicize products and help create and maintain a positive image of the 
company.
The public relations department links a firm with the media. It provides the media with 
news releases and video and audio clips, as well as holding news conferences to announce 
new products, the formation of strategic alliances, management changes, financial results, 
and similar developments. Publications issued by the department include newsletters, bro-
chures, and reports.
Publicity The type of public relations that is tied most closely to promoting a 
company’s products is publicity—nonpersonal stimulation of demand for a good, service, 
place, idea, event, person, or organization by unpaid placement of information in print or 
broadcast media. Press releases generate publicity, as does news coverage. Ironically, 
sometimes even criticism can generate publicity. Spirit Airlines recently got a lot of nega-
tive publicity when it instituted new fees for carry-on luggage—but the airline’s bookings 
increased 50 percent. This was because the airline also installed “pre-reclined” seats on its 
new planes, allowing it to add more seats and lower its airfares. Even though “pre-reclined” 
is a misnomer—the seats actually don’t recline at all but stay permanently upright—some 
observers predict that consumers looking for the cheapest airfares will continue to book 
on Spirit.41
Not-for-profit organizations benefit from publicity when they receive coverage of 
events such as the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure, which raises money for breast can-
cer research.42 When a for-profit firm teams up with a not-for-profit firm in a fund-raising 
effort, the move usually generates good publicity for both organizations.

Pushing and Pulling Strategies
Marketers can choose between two general promotional strategies: a pushing strategy 
or a pulling strategy. A pushing strategy relies on personal selling to market an item to 
wholesalers and retailers in a company’s distribution channels. So companies promote the 
product to members of the marketing channel, not to end users. Sales personnel explain to 
marketing intermediaries why they should carry particular merchandise, usually supported 
by offers of special discounts and promotional materials. Marketers also provide coopera-
tive advertising allowances, in which they share the cost of local advertising of their firm’s 
product or line with channel partners. All of these strategies are designed to motivate whole-
salers and retailers to push the good or service to their own customers.
A pulling strategy attempts to promote a product by generating consumer demand 
for it, primarily through advertising and sales promotion appeals. Potential buyers will then 
request that their suppliers—retailers or local distributors—carry the product, thereby pull-
ing it through the distribution channel. Dove used this strategy when it launched its new 
Men + Care line of men’s personal-care products during a recent Super Bowl. The 30-sec-
ond commercial, with its tagline “Be comfortable in your own skin,” generated significant 
online response, with consumers searching such terms as “Super Bowl,” “ad,” and “men” to 
find retailers that stocked the products.43
Most marketing situations require combinations of pushing and pulling strategies, 
although the primary emphasis can vary. Consumer products usually depend more heavily 
on pulling strategies than do B2B products, which favor pushing strategies.
Pricing Objectives 
in the Marketing Mix
Products offer utility, or want-satisfying power. 
However, we as consumers determine how much value we 
associate with each one. In the aftermath of a major storm, 
we may value electricity and food and water above every-
thing else. If we commute a long distance or are planning a 
vacation, fuel may be of greater concern. But all consumers 
have limited amounts of money and a variety of possible 
uses for it. So the price—the exchange value of a good or 
service—becomes a major factor in consumer buying 
decisions.
Businesspeople attempt to accomplish certain objec-
tives through their pricing decisions. Pricing objectives vary 
from firm to firm, and many companies pursue multiple 
pricing objectives. Some try to improve profits by setting 
high prices; others set low prices to attract new business. 
As Figure 13.5 shows, the four basic categories of pricing 
objectives are (1) profitability, (2) volume, (3) meeting com-
petition, and (4) prestige.

Part 4  Marketing Management
Profitability Objectives
Profitability objectives are the most common objectives 
included in the strategic plans of most firms. Marketers know 
that profits are the revenue the company brings in, minus its 
expenses. Usually a big difference exists between revenue and 
profit. Automakers try to produce at least one luxury vehicle 
for which they can charge $50,000 or more instead of relying 
entirely on the sale of $15,000 to $25,000 models.
Some firms maximize profits by reducing costs rather than 
through higher prices. Companies can maintain prices and 
increase profitability by operating more efficiently or by modify-
ing the product to make it less costly to produce. One strategy 
is to maintain a steady price while reducing the size or amount 
of the product in the package—something that manufacturers of 
candy, coffee, and cereal have done over the years. 
Volume Objectives
A second approach to pricing strategy—volume 
objectives—bases pricing decisions on market share, the per-
centage of a market controlled by a certain company or product. 
One firm may seek to achieve a 25 percent market share in a cer-
tain product category, and another may want to maintain or expand its market share for par-
ticular products. As a market becomes saturated—like the PC market—firms need to find ways 
to get consumers to upgrade or try new products. Setting a lower price can accomplish that 
objective, as long as the firm still makes a profit. Many PC makers—and retailers—have begun 
to offer their products at lower prices, particularly at the start of the school year. Although 
Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating system sold well, giving that company and electronics retail 
giant BestBuy big profits, manufacturers of PCs such as Hewlett-Packard and Dell did not 
share in the success. They had hoped that consumers would be willing to pay more for their 
new PCs, loaded with Windows 7 and many other new features. Instead consumers resisted 
paying more, and retailers offered deep discounts during a recent holiday season.44
Pricing to Meet Competition
A third set of pricing objectives seeks simply to meet competitors’ prices so that price 
essentially becomes a nonissue. In many lines of business, firms set their own prices to match 
those of established industry leaders. However, companies may not legally work together to 
agree on prices.
Because price is such a highly visible component of a firm’s marketing mix, businesses 
may be tempted to use it to obtain an advantage over competitors. But sometimes the race 
to match competitors’ prices results in a price war, which has happened periodically in the 
airline and fast-food industries. The ability of competitors to match a price cut leads many 
marketers to try to avoid price wars by favoring other strategies, such as adding value, 
improving quality, educating consumers, and establishing relationships.
Although price is a major component of the marketing mix, it is not the only one. 
Electronic readers such as the Kindle and the iPad are in a fierce pricing competition for 
digital books, as the “Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature explains.

When Amazon’s Kindle electronic reader first became available, 
Amazon charged consumers $9.99 for each e-book they purchased. 
Publishers insisted that that price was too low to keep their business 
profitable. But Amazon actually gave some e-books away for free, 
including those of living authors who earn an income from their 
writing.
Amazon explained that the free e-books were a way to get con-
sumers to check out unfamiliar writers. The hope was that they would 
then buy other works by those writers. But some publishers delay 
publication of electronic editions for several months after the hardcover 
books were issued, much as they delay paperback editions.
Should e-books be given away for free?
Summary
When Apple unveiled its iPad, it announced that it had negotiated with five of the six biggest publish-
ers to charge anywhere from $12.99 to $14.99 for each e-book edition of adult fiction and nonfiction. But 
according to insiders, Apple required the publishers to agree to discounts on best-selling books, so that the 
publicized price range was actually a ceiling, and that some prices could be lower.

PRO
1. Some publishers regard free e-books as promotion to generate 
buzz about new or unknown authors.
2. Some publishers that give away e-books on a regular basis have 
noticed an increase in sales that’s “all found money,” as one executive 
says.
CON
1. “It is illogical to give books away for free,” said David Young of 
Hachette Book Group, which publishes Stephanie Meyer’s “Twilight” 
series.
2. The relatively low price of e-books may discourage consumers 
from buying actual books with suggested retail prices of $25 or more.
Free E-Books: Good or Bad for Business?
Prestige Objectives
The final category of objectives encompasses the effect of prices on prestige. Prestige 
pricing establishes a relatively high price to develop and maintain an image of quality and 
exclusiveness. Marketers set such objectives because they recognize the role of price in 
communicating an overall image for the firm and its products. People expect to pay more for 
a Lexus, a Louis Vuitton purse, or a vacation on St. Kitts or Nevis in the Caribbean. Despite 
a recession, the British retailer Selfridges has had a 60 percent increase in sales of “must-have” 
handbags by the luxury brand Mulberry. Mulberry even has waiting lists for some of its styles.45
Scarcity can create prestige. Products that are limited in distribution or so popular that 
they become scarce generate their own prestige—allowing businesses to charge more for 
them. Unfortunately, scarcity can also invite crime. Recently, federal prosecutors charged 
four men with hacking into the computer systems of Ticketmaster, Major League Baseball, 
Telecharge, and Live Nation Entertainment to highjack 1.5 million tickets to concerts by 
Bruce Springsteen and Miley Cyrus, baseball playoff games at Yankee Stadium, and other 
events. The men or their agents posed as individual online buyers, electronically bypassed 
the vendors’ security systems, and bought blocks of tickets that they resold at hugely inflated 
prestige pricing estab-
lishes a relatively high price

prices. The scam had been in operation since 
2002 and had generated almost $29 million in 
illegal profits.46
Pricing Strategies
People from different areas of a company 
contribute their expertise to set the most stra-
tegic price for a product. Accountants, financial 
managers, and marketers provide relevant sales 
and cost data, along with customer feedback. 
Designers, engineers, and systems analysts all 
contribute important data as well.
Prices are determined in two basic ways: 
by applying the concepts of supply and demand 
discussed in Chapter 3 and by completing cost-
oriented analyses. Economic theory assumes that 
a market price will be set at the point at which 
the amount of a product desired at a given price equals the amount that suppliers will offer 
for sale at that price. In other words, this price occurs at the point at which the amount 
demanded and the amount supplied are equal. Online auctions, such as those conducted on 
eBay, are a popular application of the demand-and-supply approach.
Price Determination in Practice
Economic theory might lead to the best pricing decisions, but most businesses do not 
have all the information they need to make those decisions, so they adopt cost-based 
pricing formulas. These formulas calculate total costs per unit and then add markups to 
cover overhead costs and generate profits.
Cost-based pricing totals all costs associated with offering a product in the market, 
including research and development, production, transportation, and marketing expenses. An 
added amount, the markup, then covers any unexpected or overlooked expenses and provides 
a profit. The total becomes the price. Although the actual markup used varies by such factors 
as brand image and type of store, the typical markup for clothing is determined by doubling 
the wholesale price (the cost to the merchant) to arrive at the retail price for the item.
Breakeven Analysis
Businesses often conduct a breakeven analysis to determine the minimum sales vol-
ume a product must generate at a certain price level to cover all costs. This method involves 
a consideration of various costs and total revenues. Total cost is the sum of total variable costs 
and total fixed costs. Variable costs change with the level of production, as labor and raw 
materials do, while fixed costs such as insurance premiums and utility rates charged by water, 
natural gas, and electric power suppliers remain stable regardless of the production level. 
Total revenue is determined by multiplying price by the number of units sold.
Finding the Breakeven Point The level of sales that will generate enough 
revenue to cover all of the company’s fixed and variable costs is called the breakeven point.

It is the point at which total revenue just equals total costs. Sales beyond the breakeven point 
will generate profits; sales volume below the breakeven point will result in losses. The fol-
lowing formulas give the breakeven point in units and dollars:

A product selling for $20 with a variable cost of $14 per unit produces a $6 per-unit 
contribution to fixed costs. If the firm has total fixed costs of $42,000, then it must sell 7,000 
units to break even on the product. The calculation of the breakeven point in units and dol-
lars is as follows:

Marketers use breakeven analysis to determine the profits or losses that would result from 
several different proposed prices. Because different prices produce different breakeven points, 
marketers could compare their calculations of required sales to break even with sales estimates 
from marketing research studies. This comparison can identify the best price—one that would 
attract enough customers to exceed the breakeven point and earn profits for the firm.
Most firms add consumer demand—determining whether enough customers will buy the 
number of units the firm must sell at a particular price to break even—by developing esti-
mates through surveys of likely customers, interviews with retailers that would be handling 
the product, and assessments of prices charged by competitors. Then the breakeven points 
for several possible prices are calculated and compared with sales estimates for each price. 
This practice is referred to as modified breakeven analysis.

Alternative Pricing Strategies
The strategy a company uses to set its prices should grow out of the firm’s overall mar-
keting strategy. In general, firms can choose from four alternative pricing strategies: skim-
ming, penetration, discount or everyday low pricing, and competitive pricing.
Skimming Pricing A skimming pricing strategy sets an intentionally high price 
relative to the prices of competing products. The term comes from the expression “skimming 
the cream.” This pricing strategy often works for the introduction of a distinctive good or 
service with little or no competition, although it can be used at other stages of the product life 
cycle as well. A skimming strategy can help marketers set a price that distinguishes a firm’s 
high-end product from those of competitors. It can also help a firm recover its product devel-
opment costs before competitors enter the field. This is often the case with prescription drugs.
Penetration Pricing By contrast, a penetration pricing strategy sets a low 
price as a major marketing weapon. Businesses may price new products noticeably lower 
than competing offerings when they enter new industries characterized by dozens of com-
peting brands. Once the new product achieves some market recognition through consumer 
trial purchases stimulated by its low price, marketers may increase the price to the level of 
competing products. However, stiff competition might prevent the price increase.
Everyday Low Pricing and Discount Pricing Everyday low pricing 
(EDLP) is a strategy devoted to maintaining continuous low prices rather than relying on 
short-term price-cutting tactics such as cents-off coupons, rebates, and special sales. This 
strategy has been used successfully by retailers such as Walmart and GNC to consistently 
offer low prices to consumers; manufacturers also use EDLP to set stable prices for retailers.
With discount pricing, businesses hope to attract customers by dropping prices for a set 
period of time. Automakers usually offer consumers special discounts on most or all of their

For years the Finnish electronics giant Nokia owned an enormous 
share of the world’s cell phone market, easily beating out early com-
petitors such as Motorola and Sony Ericsson. Recently, however, it has 
found itself facing competition from Apple’s iPhone, which has begun 
to lower its prices, and from Research in Motion’s BlackBerry devices.  
The company seems to be trying various strategies, but some 
observers think Nokia has lost its strategic focus. Nokia’s chief execu-
tive, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, announced that the company would focus 
on software, citing a deal with Microsoft to create business-oriented 
mobile applications. Another executive declared that Nokia would 
become the “world’s biggest entertainment media network.” Indeed, it 
recently launched its “Comes with Music” downloading service, which 
was the first of its kind in the Middle East. But it has done poorly else-
where due to stiff competition from Apple’s iTunes. Yet another execu-
tive announced the debut of the Booklet 3G, a laptop computer that 
would make the “personal computer more social, more helpful, and 
more personal.”
At a meeting in New Delhi, India, Tuula Rytilä-Uotila, Nokia’s vice 
president of products, announced that the company planned to lower 
the prices of Nokia’s smart phones. “We want to take smart phones 
to a wider audience by bringing down the prices of such phones. The 
strategy is to be present in all price ranges.” The company hopes to 
stimulate demand for its low-end mobile phones and perhaps put some 
indirect pressure on Apple and Research in Motion, whose handsets are 
more sophisticated.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Do you think Nokia will regain lost ground with its new 
pricing strategy? Why or why not?
2. Will Nokia’s low-end cell phones make good loss leaders 
(a product sold at a low price to stimulate other sales)? 
Why or why not?

Will Lower Prices Help Nokia Regain Its Edge?
Hit 
vehicles during the holiday shopping season. After the holidays, prices usual rebound. But 
experts warn that discounting must be done carefully, or profits can disappear. Businesses 
should offer discounts only for a specified period of time and with a clear understanding of 
what they are trying to accomplish with the strategy. They should advertise the discount, so 
customers know it is a special deal. When the time period has elapsed, so should the discount.
Seeing its market share erode, Nokia is trying various ways to lure consumers back, 
including lowering prices on some of its cell phones; this strategy is discussed in the “Hit & 
Miss” feature.
Competitive Pricing Although many organizations rely heavily on price as a 
competitive weapon, even more implement competitive pricing strategies. They try to 
reduce the emphasis on price competition by matching other firms’ prices and concentrat-
ing their own marketing efforts on the product, distribution, and promotional elements of 
the marketing mix. In fact, in industries with relatively homogeneous products, competitors 
must match one another’s price reductions to maintain market share and remain competi-
tive. By pricing their products at the levels of competing offerings, marketers largely negate 
the price variable in their marketing strategies.
Consumer Perceptions of Prices
How do you perceive prices for certain products? Marketers must consider this. If large 
numbers of potential buyers consider a price too high or too low, businesses must correct 
the situation. Price–quality relationships and the use of odd pricing are important consider-
ations in setting prices.

Part 4  Marketing Management
Price–Quality Relationships
Research shows that a consumer’s perception of product quality is closely related to 
an item’s price. Most marketers believe that this perceived price–quality relationship 
remains steady over a relatively wide range of prices, although extremely high or low 
prices have less credibility. The price–quality relationship can critically affect a firm’s 
pricing strategy.
Many consumers associate prestige, quality, and high price together—believing that pay-
ing a high price for an item such as an Infiniti car or a Chanel bag not only conveys prestige 
but also ensures quality. Others believe that eating at an expensive restaurant automatically 
means the food will be better than food served at a modestly priced eating establishment. 
Conversely, consumers may view an extremely low price as an indication that corners have 
been cut and quality will suffer. Interestingly, a recent study noted that California wines made 
from organically grown grapes are less expensive than those made from nonorganic grapes. 
But this actually seemed to be a disadvantage: labeling a wine as “made from organically 
grown grapes” actually drove the price down, whereas the same wine without the certification 
notice sold for more. A number of factors may be responsible for this paradox. In the 1970s 
and 1980s, when organic wines were first produced, the reds in particular gained a bad repu-
tation for quickly turning to vinegar because they were made without preservatives, and this 
association still lingers in some consumers’ minds. Also, although “green” consumers are well 
aware of the benefits of organically grown fruits and vegetables, the benefits of organically 
grown wines are not so well known. Growers will need to communicate to consumers that in 
this case at least, price and quality don’t necessarily go together.47
Odd Pricing
Have you ever wondered why retailers set prices like $1.99 instead of $2 or $9.95 instead 
of $10? Before the age of cash registers and sales taxes, retailers reportedly followed this 
practice of odd pricing—pricing method using uneven amounts, which appear less than 
they really are to consumers—to force clerks to make correct change as part of their cash 
control efforts. But now odd pricing is commonly used because many retailers believe that 
consumers favor uneven amounts or amounts that sound less than they really are. However, 
some retailers also use this method to identify items that have been marked down. The odd 
price lets people know the item is on sale.

management and described how each fits a firm’s overall business strategy. The next few

Summary of Learning Goals
Discuss how integrated marketing communications (IMC) 
relates to a firm’s overall promotional strategy, and explain 
the concept of a promotional mix along with outlining the 
objectives of promotion.
In practicing IMC, a firm coordinates promotional activities 
to produce a unified, customer-focused message. IMC iden-
tifies consumer needs and shows how a company’s products 
meet them. Marketers select the promotional media that 
best target and reach customers. Teamwork and careful pro-
motional planning to coordinate IMC strategy components 
are important elements of these programs.
A company’s promotional mix integrates two components: 
personal selling and nonpersonal selling, which includes adver-
tising, sales promotion, and public relations. By selecting the 
appropriate combination of promotional mix elements, market-
ers attempt to achieve the firm’s five major promotional objec-
tives: provide information, differentiate a product, increase 
demand, stabilize sales, and accentuate the product’s value.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 What is the objective of an integrated marketing 
communications program? An IMC strategy focuses on 
customer needs to create a unified promotional message 
about a firm’s goods or services.
1.2 Why do firms pursue multiple promotional objec-
tives at the same time? Firms pursue multiple promotional 
objectives because they may need to convey different mes-
sages to different audiences.
1.3 What are product placement and guerrilla market-
ing? Product placement involves paying a fee to have a 
product showcased in certain media. Guerrilla marketing is 
innovative, low-cost marketing efforts designed to get con-
sumers’ attention in unusual ways.
Summarize the different types of advertising and advertis-
ing media.
Advertising, the most visible form of nonpersonal promotion, 
is designed to inform, persuade, or remind. Product advertis-
ing promotes a good or service, while institutional advertis-
ing promotes a concept, idea, organization, or philosophy. 
Television, newspapers, and magazines are the largest adver-
tising media categories. Others include direct mail, radio, and 
outdoor advertising. Interactive advertising directly involves 
the consumer, who controls the flow of information.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 What are the two basic types of advertising? Into 
what three categories do they fall? The two basic types 
are product and institutional. They fall into the categories of 
informative, persuasive, and reminder-oriented advertising.
2.2 What is the leading advertising medium in the U.S. 
According to the most recent statistics listed in Figure 13.2, 
television is the leading advertising medium in the U.S.
2.3 In what two major ways do firms benefit from spon-
sorship? Firms benefit from sponsorship in two ways: gain 
exposure to the event’s audience, and association with the 
activity’s image.
Outline the roles of sales promotion, personal selling, and 
public relations in promotional strategy.
Sales promotion accounts for greater expenditures than adver-
tising. Consumer-oriented sales promotions such as coupons, 
games, rebates, samples, premiums, contests, sweepstakes, and 
promotional products offer an extra incentive to buy a prod-
uct. Point-of-purchase advertising displays and trade shows 
are sales promotions directed to the trade markets. Personal 
selling involves face-to-face interactions between seller and 
buyer. The primary sales tasks are order processing, creative 
selling, and missionary selling. Public relations is nonpaid 
promotion that seeks to enhance a company’s public image.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 Why do retailers and manufacturers use sales pro-
motions? Retailers and manufacturers use sales promotions 
to offer consumers extra incentives to buy their products.
3.2 When does a firm use personal selling instead of 
nonpersonal selling? Personal selling is generally used when 
customers are few and geographically concentrated, the product 
is technically complex or requires special handling, the price is 
high, or the product moves through direct-distribution channels.
3.3 How does public relations serve a marketing purpose? 
Public relations can be an efficient, indirect communications 
channel for promoting products. It can publicize products and 
help create and maintain a positive image of the company.
Describe pushing and pulling promotional strategies.
A pushing strategy relies on personal selling to market a product 
to wholesalers and retailers in a company’s distribution channels. 
A pulling strategy promotes the product by generating con-
sumer demand for it, through advertising and sales promotion.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 Give an example of a pushing strategy. An example 
of a pushing strategy is that used by drug manufactur-
ers, who used to market solely to physicians and hospitals. 
Today, they also use a pulling strategy by marketing directly 
to patients through advertising, which encourages patients to 
ask their doctors about medications.
4.2 Give an example of a pulling strategy. Pulling strate-
gies are used by retailers and by manufacturers of consumer 
goods like cosmetics, automobiles, and clothing.
Outline the different types of pricing objectives.
Pricing objectives can be classified as profitability, volume, 
meeting competition, and prestige. Profitability objectives are 
the most common. Volume objectives base pricing decisions on 
market share. Meeting competitors’ prices makes price a nonis-
sue in competition. Prestige pricing establishes a high price to 
develop and maintain an image of quality or exclusiveness.

Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 Define price. Price is the exchange value of a good or service.
5.2 What is a second approach to pricing strategy? A 
second approach to pricing strategy is volume objectives, 
which bases pricing decisions on market share.
Discuss how firms set prices in the marketplace, and 
describe the four alternative pricing strategies.
Although economic theory determines prices by the law of 
demand and supply, most firms use cost-based pricing, which 
adds a markup after costs. They usually conduct a breakeven 
analysis to determine the minimum sales volume a product 
must generate at a certain price to cover costs. The four alterna-
tive pricing strategies are skimming, penetration, everyday low 
pricing and discounting, and competitive pricing. A skimming 
strategy sets a high price initially to recover costs and then low-
ers it; a penetration strategy sets a lower price and then raises it 
later. Everyday low pricing and discounting offers a lower price 
for a period of time. Competitive pricing matches other firms’ 
prices and emphasizes nonprice benefits of a product.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 What is a cost-based pricing formula? A cost-based 
pricing formula calculates the total costs per unit and then 
adds markups to cover overhead costs and generate profits.
6.2 Why do companies implement competitive pricing 
strategies? Companies use competitive pricing strategies to 
reduce the emphasis on price competition by matching other 
firms’ prices and concentrating their own marketing efforts 
on the product, distribution, and promotional elements of 
the marketing mix.
Discuss consumer perceptions of price.
Marketers must consider how consumers perceive the price–
quality relationship of their products. Consumers may be 
willing to pay a higher price if they perceive a product to be 
of superior quality. Marketers often use odd pricing to con-
vey a message to consumers.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 How does the price–quality relationship affect a 
firm’s pricing strategy? Consumers must believe that the 
price of an item reflects its quality, except in extreme cases. 
So a firm must try to set its prices accordingly.
7.2 Why is odd pricing used? Retailers believe that con-
sumers favor uneven amounts or amounts that sound like 
less than they really are. Odd pricing may also be used to 
indicate a sale item.

Chapter 13  Promotion and Pricing Strategies
Projects and Teamwork Applications
1. Choose a product that you purchased recently. Identify 
the various media that were used to promote the product 
and analyze the promotional mix. Do you agree with the 
company’s marketing strategy, or would you recommend 
changes to the mix? Why? Create your own print ad for the 
product you chose, using any business strategies or knowl-
edge you have learned in this course so far.
2. Evaluate the price of the product you selected in the pre-
ceding exercise. What appears to be the pricing strategy 
used by its manufacturer? Do you think the price is fair? 
Why or why not? Choose a different strategy and develop 
a new price for the product based on the strategy. Poll your 
classmates to learn whether they would purchase the prod-
uct at the new price—and why.
3. Some schools have received financial benefits by allowing 
companies to promote their goods and services to students. 
Others have decided against the practice, and some states 
have laws banning this type of promotion. Find some exam-
ples of corporate sponsors in public elementary and high 
schools and on college campuses. With your class, discuss 
the pros and cons of promotion in public schools and on col-
lege campuses. In your view, is there a distinction between a 
public school and a college campus? Why or why not?
4. On your own or with a classmate, research a recent situation 
that has caused a business, a not-for-profit organization, or 
a government agency to suffer from bad publicity. Evaluate 
the situation and create a program outlining steps the orga-
nization might take to build better public relations.
5. You are the marketing manager that is introducing a new 
line of video games. What approach would you take for 
establishing prices?

Case 13.1
Brand Names versus Store Brands
Shoppers who buy brand-name products usually cite 
quality as a reason. Shoppers who buy store-brand products 
usually cite price. Is it possible to have the best of both worlds? 
Retailers such as Target, CVS, and Walgreens have 
found they had too many of the same products under 
different brand names. They saw that shoppers were buy-
ing less and looking for bigger bargains than usual. Items 
that weren’t selling well were replaced by more popular 
brands or by in-house generics. This was particularly true 
of such basic items as household and personal products 
and food staples. As one observer said, “People don’t 
want to have to choose between among 15 or 20 different 
brands of toilet paper or paper towels or even basic food 
stuff.” The retailers were confident that shoppers would be 
eager to snap up these bargains. 
Target guessed that consumers would buy their 
in-house brands and it looks like they were correct. The 
high quality store lines that Target stocks have yielded a 2 
percent increase in same-store sales for one recent month. 
The in-store brands of up & up, Archer Farms, and Market 
Pantry account for more than 20 percent of all food prod-
ucts sold at Target. A retailing analyst wrote in a recent 

Part 4  Marketing Management
460
report, “the company has unique top-line drivers that 
aren’t dependent on macro recovery.”
To some extent, this overall strategy has worked. The 
market share of store brands has grown between 2 and 
6 percent. And 77 percent of consumers who bought less 
expensive store-brand items were satisfied with their choice.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Why do you think chain stores carry brand-name 
items alongside their own in-house brands?
2. What are some of the ways that stores such as 
Target are able to keep their prices low?

Marketing to the Teenage Crowd
CASE 1.2
Case 13.2
Today’s teenagers were born shortly before the turn of the 
21st century. They represent billions of dollars in buying power, 
but the big question for marketers is how to reach them.
Unlike their parents, today’s teens have grown up in 
this electronic age and take it for granted. Like those of 
earlier generations, today’s teens like to communicate with 
each other. Unlike their predecessors, they now can do so 
almost constantly. One study estimates that teenagers spend 
more than seven hours a day using media of various kinds, 
mostly electronic. How do they log this astonishing amount 
of time? By sacrificing sleep and multitasking. Some older 
teens can perform seven activities at once. Parents often 
find their teens listening to music, watching TV program, 
doing homework, playing a videogame, and text messaging. 
What media do teenagers neglect or ignore? They 
hardly ever read newspapers. Jeffrey Cole, the director 
of the Center for the Digital Future at the University of 
Southern California, predicts that printed newspapers 
will eventually become extinct as social media steadily 
increase in power. Teens want news, he explains, but only 
about the narrowly focused community of their peers.
Teenagers don’t contact their peers through e-mail. One 
survey indicates that although 73 percent of teens visit social-
networking sites, only about 8 percent use Twitter. They do 
like smart phones, especially those with apps for constant sta-
tus updates, but don’t make many phone calls. Instead, they 
text message sometimes sending up to ten messages an hour.
Marketers will need to learn how to reach teenag-
ers by recognizing that teens like to be invited to get 
involved, rather than being told. This means asking for 
their input, listening to them with genuine respect, adopt-
ing their suggestions, and continuing to ask for feedback. 
Morgan Stewart of ExactTarget conducted a survey asking 
teens which brand they thought did the best job of com-
municating with them. To his surprise, Amazon got more 
write-in votes than any other brand, including Facebook. 
He says of Amazon, “Teens can read reviews, they can 
submit their own, and they can get recommendations 
based on what they like.” Stewart believes that “manag-
ing your Amazon presence is more important than build-
ing out a Facebook strategy.”
Of course, even Amazon is only one component of an 
integrated marketing plan. Teenagers are highly suspicious 
of anything that seems even remotely like advertising. 
When shopping, they depend heavily on the opinions of 
their peers. They also enjoy fun sites such as Sporcle.com, 
FunnyOrDie.com, and FailBlog.org. YouTube is another 
important tool for viral marketing, as well as being free.
Jeffrey Cole thinks that as today’s teens move into adult-
hood, the allure of knowing everything about their friends will 
fade. What will endure will be something that every genera-
tion wants: they will still want to have “total control over their 
media” as a way of having “real control over their lives.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Do you think marketers can reach teens with 
specially tailored promotional campaigns for such 
goods and services as video games, smartphone 
apps, concert tickets, and so on? Why or why not?
2. How can marketers best target teens so as to 
appeal to them but without making them feel 
talked down to? Suggest a marketing or pro-
motional theme for one product that you think 
would appeal to a teen.

Pet Airways Handles Pets With Loving Care
CASE 1.3
Case 13.3
Pet owners want the best for their dogs and cats, 
as evidenced by the $50 billion pet industry in the U.S., 
including everything from grooming services to squeaky 
toys. One area that has received little attention is travel. 
Although owners can find lodging that allows pets, and 
they can purchase travel carriers and gear, until recently 
there was little choice when it came to transport. If the 
animal had to travel long distance, it was relegated to the 
cargo hold of a plane. A couple of years ago, that changed 
when Dan Wiesel and Alysa Binder wanted to be able to 
transport their Jack Russell terrier safely and comfortably. 
So they started a pet transport business called Pet Airways.
“There are 80 million pets traveling around the U.S.,” 
says Alysa Binder. “There’s definitely a market for this. 
We’re part of the pet community—we understand.” Wiesel 
and Binder contracted with a firm that flies Beechcraft 1900 
aircraft, selecting this plane for its versatility and safety 
record. They had the planes retrofitted to accommodate 
pet carriers in the main cabin. They launched their reserva-
tion system online and spread the word via social media. 
When traditional media heard of the new company, Wiesel 
and Binder appeared on such television shows as Good 
Morning America and The Today Show, as well as in magazines 
and newspapers. Because of this publicity, Pet Airways has 
spent nothing on advertising. Its greatest marketing chal-
lenge has been educating the public about their service. 
“Because we’re the first to market, we have to tell people 
what we’re all about,” explains Binder.
Pet owners who want to book their animals on a Pet 
Airways flight make a reservation on the airline’s Web site, 
http://www.petairways.com. One hour before departure, own-
ers check in at the Pet Lounge. Pet passengers are boarded in 
their carriers, attended to by professional pet Attendants who 
accompany the animals on the flight, checking on them every 
15 minutes to make sure they are secure and comfortable. 
Once the plane has landed, owners (or designated recipients) 
collect their pets in the Pet Lounge.
Pet Airways currently operates flights to nine cities 
around the U.S. Alysa Binder says the firm’s goal is to 
reach 20 cities in the next 18 months. She notes that cus-
tomers are willing and eager to pay for the service, consid-
ering it reasonable compared to traditional airlines.
Pet Airways fares start at $149. By comparison, 
American Airlines charges $100 for a pet to travel beneath 
a seat and $150 as baggage; Delta charges $150 and $275 
respectively; and Northwest charges $150 and $225 respec-
tively. Binder remarks that her customers don’t usually con-
sider price anyway because “we aren’t the same as general 
carriers. It’s a completely different service. People know that.”
Pet Airways customers can register to receive the 
company’s newsletter, which includes insider news on 
special flight deals and other promotions. They can join 
the MyPAWS Club, which offers a 40 percent discount 
on pet supplies at the Pet Airways online store, a 10 
percent discount at pet-friendly hotels, 10 percent off at 
1-800-PetMeds, 5 percent off on pet health insurance 
from Pets Best Insurance, and discounts and free samples 
from other Pet Airways partners.
Wiesel and Binder saw an opportunity in the market-
place and jumped at the chance to offer a safe, reliable 
solution for pet owners to transport their pets. “On Pet 
Airways, your pets aren’t packages, they’re passengers.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. At this stage of Pet Airway’s life cycle, what 
should be the company’s primary promotional 
objectives? Why?
2. Pet Airways has not yet engaged in major 
advertising efforts. Which media would 
probably be most effective at reaching the 
firm’s intended market? Why?
3. Pet Airways already offers some consumer-
oriented promotions. Describe or outline an idea 
for a new promotion and explain your choice.
4. Outline Pet Airways’ pricing objectives. How 
might these change over the next five years? 
Ten years? What do you think the best pricing 
strategy for Pet Airways should be? Why?

Part 4  Marketing Management
Not long ago, the phrase “hybrid SUV” would have 
seemed an oxymoron. But in just a few short years, fuel-
efficient hybrids of all shapes and sizes have appeared in 
showrooms. This new generation of vehicles combines fuel-
efficient gas engines, natural gas engines, and hydrogen fuel 
cells. As gas prices soar and concern over the environment 
grows, consumers will become more and more interested in 
them.
Enter Lee Lindquist, Alternative Fuels Specialist at 
Scholfield Honda in Wichita, Kansas. A passionate environ-
mentalist, Lee was researching alternative-fuel vehicles when 
he learned that Honda had been selling a natural gas Civic 
GX in New York and California since 1998. Originally mar-
keted to municipalities and corporations as a way of address-
ing air quality issues, the Civic GX seemed the perfect way 
for cost-conscious Kansans to combat rising fuel prices. It 
was also a way to promote local resources, since Kansas is a 
major producer of natural gas.
Lee took the idea of the Civic GX to his boss, owner 
Roger Scholfield, who was skeptical of it at first. Scholfield 
had long promoted the Honda as a fuel-efficient vehicle and 
didn’t want to muddy the waters with this new vehicle. But 
eventually he warmed to the idea and began offering the car 
to his corporate customers. 
When the tornado hit Greensburg, the idea of going 
green took on a whole new life at Scholfield Honda. One of 
the problems with offering the Civic GX had been the lack 
of natural gas fueling stations, as well as the high cost of 
constructing one. Well aware of the media attention sur-
rounding Greensburg, Scholfield decided to donate a natural 
gas Civic to the town, along with a fueling station. 
Scholfield was up-front about the decision to donate the 
car. The investment was a costly one, and there were many 
less expensive ways of reaching his customers in Wichita. 
Scholfield admits he questioned his decision even as he drove 
into Greensburg for the presentation. But the bottom line 
was that it was the right thing to do. Today, when customers 
come into Scholfield’s dealership, they are more interested in 
alternative-fuel and high-efficiency vehicles.
If you want to buy a Civic GX from Scholfield Honda 
today, get in line, because the staff can’t keep them in stock. 
While you wait, enjoy a nice cup of coffee served in a com-
postable, corn-based disposable cup. Toss those old soda 
cans rattling around in your back seat into Scholfield’s recy-
cling bins. And on your way out, don’t forget to take your 
complimentary Scholfield Honda reusable green shopping 
bag and water bottle.
Questions
After viewing the video, answer the following questions:
1. Do you think Scholfield’s green marketing campaign will 
change consumers’ opinions of hybrid and alternative-
fuel cars?
2. Do you think Scholfield’s donation of a natural gas Civic 
to the town of Greensburg will drive business to his deal-
ership in Wichita? Why or why not?

L A U N C H I N G  Y O U R 
Launching Your 
Marketing Career
In Part 4, “Marketing 
Management,” you learned about the 
goals and functions of marketing. The 
three chapters in this part emphasized 
the central role of customer satisfac-
tion in defining value and developing 
a marketing strategy in traditional 
and nontraditional marketing settings. 
You learned about the part played 
by marketing research and the need 
for relationship marketing in today’s 
competitive environment. You discov-
ered how new products are developed 
and how they evolve through the four 
stages of the product life cycle, from 
introduction through growth and 
maturity to decline. You also learned 
about the role of different channels in 
creating effective distribution strate-
gies. Finally, you saw the impact of 
integrated marketing communications 
on the firm’s promotional strategy, 
the role of advertising, and the way 
pricing influences consumer behav-
ior. Perhaps you came across some 
marketing tasks and functions that 
sounded especially appealing to you. 
Here are a few ideas about careers 
in marketing that you may want to 
pursue.
The first thing to remember is 
that, as the chapters in this part made 
clear, marketing is about a great deal 
more than personal selling and adver-
tising. For instance, are you curious 
about why people behave the way 
they do? Are you good at spotting 
trends? Marketing research analysts seek 
answers to a wide range of questions 
about business competition, customer 
preferences, market trends, and past 
and future sales. They often design 
and conduct their own consumer sur-
veys, using the telephone, mail, the 
Internet, or personal interviews and 
focus groups. After they analyze the 
data they’ve collected, their recom-
mendations form input for managerial 
decisions about whether to intro-
duce new products, revamp current 
ones, enter new markets, or abandon 
products or markets where profit-
ability is low. As members of a new-
product development team, marketing 
researchers often work directly with 
members of other business depart-
ments such as scientists, production 
and manufacturing personnel, and 
finance employees. Also, marketing 
researchers are increasingly asked to 
help clients implement their recom-
mendations. With today’s highly com-
petitive economy, jobs in this area are 
expected to grow. Annual earnings for 
marketing research analysts average 
about $61,000.1
Another career path in marketing 
is sales. Do you work well with others 
and read their feelings accurately? Are 
you a self-starter? Being a sales repre-
sentative might be for you. Selling jobs 
exist in every industry, and because 
many use a combination of salary 
and performance-based commissions, 
they can pay handsomely. Sales jobs 
are often a first step on the ladder to 
upper-management positions as well. 
Sales representatives work for whole-
salers and manufacturing companies 
(and even for publishers such as the 
one that produces this book). They 
sell automobiles, computer systems 
and technology, pharmaceuticals, 
advertising, insurance, real estate, 
commodities and financial services, 
and all kinds of consumer goods and 
services.
If you’re interested in mass com-
munications, note that print and 
online magazines, newspapers, and 
broadcast companies such as ESPN 
and MTV generate most of their 
revenue from advertising, so sales rep-
resentatives who sell space and time 
slots in the media contribute a great 
deal to the success of these firms.2 
And if you like to travel, consider that 
many sales jobs involve travel.
Advertising, marketing manage-
ment, and public relations are other 
categories of marketing. In large com-
panies, marketing managers, product 
managers, promotion managers, and 
public relations managers often work 
long hours under pressure; they may 
travel frequently or transfer between 
jobs at headquarters and positions in 
regional offices. Their responsibilities 
include directing promotional pro-
grams, overseeing advertising cam-
paigns and budgets, and conducting 
communications such as press releases 
with the firm’s publics. Thousands 
of new positions are expected to 

464
Part 4  Marketing Management
open up in the next several years; the 
field is expected to grow 14 percent 
over the next decade. Growth of the 
Internet and new media has especially 
increased demand for advertising and 
public relations specialists.3
Advertising and public relations 
firms employed about 458,000 people 
in a recent year.4 About one in five 
U.S. advertising firms are located in 
New York or California, and more 
than a quarter of advertising industry 
workers live in those two states. Most 
advertising firms develop specialties; 
many of the largest are international 
in scope and earn a major propor-
tion of their revenue abroad. Online 
advertising is just one area in which 
new jobs will be opening in the future, 
as more and more client firms expand 
their online sales operations.
Career Assessment Exercises in 
Marketing
1. Select a field that interests you. 
Use the Internet to research types 
of sales positions available in that 
field. Locate a few entry-level job 
openings and see what career steps 
that position can lead to. (You 
might wish to start with a popular 
job-posting site such as Monster.
com.) Note the job requirements, 
the starting salary, and the form 
of compensation—straight sal-
ary? salary plus commission?—and 
write a one-page summary of your 
findings.
2. Use the Internet to identify and 
investigate two or three of the 
leading advertising agencies in the 
United States, such as Young & 
Rubicam or J. Walter Thompson. 
What are some of their recent 
ad campaigns, or who are their 
best-known clients? Where do 
the agencies have offices? What 
job openings do they currently 
list, and what qualifications should 
applicants for these positions have? 
Write a brief report comparing 
the agencies you selected, decide 
which one you would prefer to 
work for, and give your reasons.
3. Test your research skills. Choose 
an ordinary product, such as tooth-
paste or soft drinks, and conduct 
a survey to find out why people 
chose the brand they most recently 
purchased. For instance, suppose 
you wanted to find out how peo-
ple choose their shampoo. List as 
many decision criteria as you can 
think of, such as availability, scent, 
price, packaging, benefits from use 
(conditioning, dandruff-reducing, 
and so on), brand name, and ad 
campaign. Ask eight to ten friends 
to rank these decision factors, and 
note some simple demographics 
about your research subjects such 
as their age, gender, and occupa-
tion. Tabulate your results. What 
did you find out about how your 
subjects made their purchase deci-
sion? Did any of your findings 
surprise you? Can you think of 
any ways in which you might have 
improved your survey?

Google’s New Android Smart 
Phone: It’s Incredible
 A s more companies develop mobile technology 
for smart phones and other hand-held devices, 
consumers can choose from among several basic 
operating systems, or mobile platforms: Apple’s OS 
for its iPhone and iPad, Microsoft’s Windows Mobile 
7, and Google’s Android. Android is unique among 
mobile platforms in that it is not only free but also 
an open source system. Each manufacturer can 
customize Android for its own hand-held devices. 
Several manufacturers—including Motorola, HTC, 
Sprint, Samsung, and T-Mobile—have already 
introduced their own Android smart phones. Google 
itself has entered the smart phone market with its 
first Android model, the Motorola Droid, and most 
recently, Google introduced the Droid Incredible, 
manufactured by the Taiwan-based HTC and 
developed in conjunction with Verizon Wireless.
The Incredible is among the slimmest and lightest of 
smart phones so far. It has 8 gigabytes of memory as 
well as WiFi. Along with the Android 2.1 operating 
system, it comes equipped with HTC’s Sense user 
interface. Sense supports up to seven home screens 
that users can customize. As with the iPhone, a 
simple twist of the wrist converts the screen from 
portrait (vertical) to landscape (horizontal) format. 
Also like the iPhone, the Incredible has an on-screen 
keyboard. With the “Leap” feature, a simple pinch 
gesture allows you to see thumbnail versions of 
all of them at once. Spread your fingers apart 
to see more of a page in smaller-size type. The 
multitouch feature also allows you to highlight text 
in a document or on a Web page by pressing and 
holding a finger on it. The Incredible has speech-to-
text capabilities. The user dictates into the phone, 
which then converts the words into a text file. It 
also has GPS navigation. All of these functions bring 
technology for use in business and at home right to 
your fingertips.
Another of the Sense interface features is Friend 
Stream, which integrates the phone’s contact 
list with Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and other 
social-networking sites on a single screen for 
unified updates. The Incredible also has access 
to 30,000—and counting—apps in the Android 
Marketplace.
In the first month after its release, the Incredible’s 
sales surpassed those of Apple’s iPhone in the 
United States in terms of number of phones 
purchased. BlackBerry was still in the lead with 
36 percent of sales, followed by Android with 28 
percent.
Google has even bigger plans for the Android 
platform. Sony and Intel are working with Google on 
developing Android set-top boxes and televisions. 
Samsung, the largest television manufacturer in 
the world, is considering installing the Android 
system on some models. Owners of Web-enabled 
Android TVs will be able to download YouTube, 
weather, stocks, and other apps from the Android 
Marketplace in addition to the channels available 
from their satellite or cable provider.1

Part 5  Managing Technology and Information
468
This chapter explores how businesses 
manage information as a resource, par-
ticularly how they use technology to do so. 
Today, virtually all business functions—from 
human resources to production to supply 
chain management—rely on information 
systems. The chapter begins by differentiat-
ing between information and data and then 
defines an information system. The compo-
nents of information systems are presented, 
and two major types of information systems 
are described. Because of their importance to 
organizations, the chapter discusses 
databases, the heart of all information 
systems. Then the chapter looks at the 
computer hardware and software that drive 
information systems. Today, specialized net-
works make information access and trans-
mission function smoothly, so the chapter 
examines different types of telecommunica-
tions and computer networks to see how 
businesses are applying them for competi-
tive advantage. The chapter then turns to a 
discussion of the ethical and security issues 
affecting information systems, followed by 
a description of how organizations plan for, 
and recover from, information system 
disasters. A review of the current trends 
in information systems concludes the 
chapter.
Overview

Data, Information, and 
Information Systems
Every day, businesspeople ask themselves questions such as the following:
 
• How well is our product selling in Atlanta compared with Tampa? Have sales among 
consumers aged 25 to 45 increased or decreased within the past year?
 • How will rising energy prices affect production and distribution costs?
 • If employees can access the benefits system through our network, will this increase or 
decrease benefit costs?
 • Can we communicate more efficiently and effectively with our increasingly dispersed 
workforce?
An effective information system can help answer these and many other questions. Data 
consist of raw facts and figures that may or may not be relevant to a business decision. 
Information is knowledge gained from processing those facts and figures. So although 
businesspeople need to gather data about the demographics of a target market or the speci-
fications of a certain product, the data are useless unless they are transformed into relevant 
information that can be used to make a competitive decision. For instance, data might be the 
sizes of various demographic groups. Information drawn from those data could be how many 
of those individuals are potential customers for a firm’s products. Technology has advanced 
so quickly that all businesses, regardless of size or location, now have access to data and 
information that can make them competitive in a global arena.

Chapter 14  Using Technology to Manage Information

An information system is an organized method for collecting, storing, and commu-
nicating past, present, and projected information on internal operations and external intel-
ligence. Most information systems today use computer and telecommunications technology. 
A large organization typically assigns responsibility for directing its information systems and 
related operations to an executive called the chief information officer (CIO). Often, the 
CIO reports directly to the firm’s chief executive officer (CEO). An effective CIO can under-
stand and harness technology so that the company can communicate internally and externally 
in one seamless operation. But small companies rely just as much on information systems as 
do large ones, even if they do not employ a manager assigned to this area on a full-time basis.
The role of the CIO is both expanding and changing as the technology to manage infor-
mation continues to develop. Over the past ten years, the role of a CIO has changed from 
being a technical one to that of a business partner who often exerts strong influence over 
his or her company’s strategy. CIOs will need to adapt their roles even further in the future. 
Moreover, CIOs and former CIOs are beginning to appear on company boards more often.2
Information systems can be tailored to assist many business functions and depart-
ments—from marketing and manufacturing to finance and accounting. They can manage the 
overwhelming flood of information by organizing data in a logical and accessible manner. 
Through the system, a company can monitor all components of its operations and busi-
ness strategy, identifying problems and opportunities. Information systems gather data from 
inside and outside the organization; they then process the data to produce information that 
is relevant to all aspects of the organization. Processing steps could involve storing data for 
later use, classifying and analyzing it, and retrieving it easily when needed.
Many companies—and nations—combine high-tech and low-tech solutions to manage 
the flow of information. E-mail, wireless communications, and videoconferencing haven’t 
totally replaced paper memos, phone conversations, and face-to-face meetings, but they are 
increasingly common. Information can make the difference between staying in business and 
going bankrupt. Keeping on top of changing consumer demands, competitors’ actions, and 
the latest government regulations will help a firm fine-tune existing products, develop new 
winners, and maintain effective marketing.
Components and Types 
of Information Systems
The definition of information system in the previous section does not specifically mention 
the use of computers or technology. In fact, information systems have been around since the 
beginning of civilization and were, by today’s standards, very low tech. Think about your 
college or university’s library. At one time the library probably had card catalog files to help 
you find information. Those files were information systems because they stored data about 
books and periodicals in an organized manner on 3-by-5-inch index cards. Users could 
flip through the cards and locate library materials by author, title, or subject, although the 
process could be tedious and time consuming.
Today, however, when businesspeople think about information systems, they are most 
likely thinking about computer-based information systems. These systems rely on com-
puter and related technologies to store information electronically in an organized, accessible 
manner. So, instead of card catalogs, your college library probably uses a computerized infor-
mation system that allows users to search through library holdings much faster and easier.

Part 5  Managing Technology and Information

Computer-based information systems consist of four components and technologies:
 
• computer hardware
 • computer software
 • telecommunications and computer networks
 • data resource management.
Computer hardware consists of machines that range from supercomputers to smart 
phones. It also includes the input, output, and storage devices needed to support computing 
machines. Software includes operating systems, such as Microsoft’s Windows 7 or Linux, 
and applications programs, such as Adobe Acrobat or Oracle’s PeopleSoft Enterprise appli-
cations. Telecommunications and computer networks encompass the hardware and software 
needed to provide wired or wireless voice and data communications. This includes support 
for external networks such as the Internet and private internal networks. Data resource man-
agement involves developing and maintaining an organization’s databases so that decision 
makers are able to access the information they need in a timely manner.
In the case of your college or university library, the computer-based information sys-
tem is generally made up of computer hardware, such as monitors and keyboards, which are 
linked to the library’s network and a database containing information on the library’s hold-
ings. Specialized software allows users to access the database. In addition, the library’s net-
work is likely also connected to a larger private network and the Internet. This connection 
gives users remote access to the library’s database, as well as access to other computerized 
databases such as LexisNexis.
Databases
The heart of any information system is its database, a centralized integrated collection 
of data resources. A company designs its databases to meet particular information process-
ing and retrieval needs of its workforce. Businesses 
obtain databases in many ways. They can hire a 
staff person to build them on site, hire an outside 
source to do so, or buy packaged database programs 
from specialized vendors, such as Oracle. A database 
serves as an electronic filing cabinet, capable of stor-
ing massive amounts of data and retrieving it within 
seconds. A database should be continually updated; 
otherwise, a firm may find itself with data that are 
outdated and possibly useless. One problem with 
databases is that they can contribute to informa-
tion overload—too much data for people to absorb 
or data that are not relevant to decision making. 
Because computer processing speed and storage 
capacity are both increasing rapidly, and because 
data have become more abundant, businesspeople 
need to be careful that their databases contain only 
the facts they need. If they don’t, they can waste 
time wading through unnecessary data. Another 
challenge with databases is keeping them safe, as the 
“Hit & Miss” feature describes.

In the third such incident in a year, Wyndham Hotels and 
Resorts—which owns Days Inn, Ramada, Super 8, and other hotel 
chains and restaurants—discovered that one of its secure databases 
had been compromised. From a single breach, a hacker gained access 
to customer information from several of the company’s restaurants and 
other properties, then downloaded it to an off-site URL. The informa-
tion included names and credit card numbers of guests, the cards’ 
expiration dates, and other data from the magnetic strip on each card. 
Wyndham does not record customers’ birth dates, Social Security num-
bers, addresses, or other identifying information, and those data were 
not included. The breach was discovered when a credit card processor 
and an issuer informed Wyndham that they had become concerned 
about “unusual fraud patterns” on the cards.
Wyndham took immediate steps to stop the break-in. In an open 
letter on its Web site, the company stated, “We deeply regret that this 
incident occurred,” and detailed its investigation. The chain notified 
the U.S. Secret Service, which investigates counterfeiting, as well as the 
attorneys general of several states. It hired an outside investigator to 
appraise the damage and advise on improving security. It also hired a 
firm that specializes in credit card industry standards to look into each 
compromised property in order to improve compliance. In addition, 
Wyndham notified American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover of 
card numbers that may have been involved.
Wyndham assured guests that identity theft was unlikely, but 
warned them to monitor their credit card statements and reports 
vigilantly and to report any suspicious activity to the cards’ issuers. It 
offered affected guests free credit monitoring and set up a special toll-
free line that all guests could call for more information.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What steps do you think Wyndham should take to pre-
vent a future security breach?
2. What can Wyndham do to assure its guests that it will 
protect them from credit card fraud?

Decision makers can also look up online data. Online systems give access to enormous 
amounts of government data, such as economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
and the Department of Commerce. One of the largest online databases is that of the U.S. 
Census Bureau. The census of population, conducted every ten years, attempts to collect data 
on more than 120 million households across the United States. After attempting to count 
everyone in the country, the Census Bureau has selected participants fill out forms contain-
ing questions about marital status, place of birth, ethnic background, citizenship, workplaces, 
commuting time, income, occupation, type of housing, number of telephones and vehicles, 
even grandparents as caregivers. Households receiving the most recent questionnaire can 
respond in English as well as a variety of other languages including Spanish, Chinese, 
Vietnamese, and Korean. Not surprisingly, sifting through all the collected data takes time. 
Although certain restrictions limit how businesspeople can access and use specific census data, 
the general public may access the data via the American FactFinder on the Census Bureau’s 
Web site (http://factfinder.census.gov), as well as at state data centers and public libraries.
Another source of free information is company Web sites. Interested parties can visit 
firms’ home pages to look for information about customers, suppliers, and competitors. 
Trade associations and academic institutions also maintain Web sites with information on 
topics of interest.
Types of Information Systems
Many different types of information systems exist. In general, however, information 
systems fall into two broad categories: operational support systems or management support 
systems.

data surprise you? Why or

system is the most vital 
information system.

Part 5  Managing Technology and Information
472
Operational Support 
Systems Operational support 
systems are designed to produce a 
variety of information on an orga-
nization’s activities for both internal 
and external users. Examples of 
operational support systems include 
transaction processing systems and 
process control systems. Transaction 
processing systems record and 
process data from business transac-
tions. For example, major retailers 
use point-of-sale systems, which link 
electronic cash registers to the retail-
er’s computer centers. Sales data are 
transmitted from cash registers to 
the computer center either immedi-
ately or at regular intervals. Process 
control systems monitor and con-
trol physical processes. A steel mill, 
for instance, may have electronic 
sensors linked to a computer system 
monitoring the entire production 
process. The system makes neces-
sary changes and alerts operators to 
potential problems.
Commercial airplane manufac-
turer Airbus relies on a sophisticated 
information system based on RFID 
(radio-frequency identification) technology to track parts and tools used in the production 
and maintenance of its products, including its new A350 XWB planes. The information sys-
tem follows parts, on which high-memory RFID tags have been placed, from warehouses to 
production facilities to the specific lines where they are attached to aircraft. The system also 
tracks how and where tools are used. Airbus expects the information system to improve over-
all supply chain management, reduce required inventory levels, and increase productivity.3
Management Support Systems Information systems that are designed to pro-
vide support for effective decision making are classified as management support systems. 
Several different types of management support systems are available. A management infor-
mation system (MIS) is designed to produce reports to managers and other professionals.
A decision support system (DSS) gives direct support to businesspeople during the 
decision-making process. For instance, a marketing manager might use a decision support 
system to analyze the impact on sales and profits of a product price change.
An executive support system (ESS) lets senior executives access the firm’s primary 
databases, often by touching the computer screen, pointing and clicking a mouse, or using 
voice recognition. The typical ESS allows users to choose from many kinds of data, such as 
the firm’s financial statements and sales figures, as well as stock market trends for the com-
pany and for the industry as a whole. If they wish, managers can start by looking at summa-
ries and then access more detailed information when needed.

passenger safety. To track parts, schedule inspections, and 
manage inventory levels, many airlines use an operational support 
system. In this ad, American Airlines reports that improved 
business processes have turned costly maintenance operations 
into a source of profit.

Finally, an expert system is a computer program that imitates human thinking through 
complicated sets of “if-then” rules. The system applies human knowledge in a specific sub-
ject area to solve a problem. Expert systems are used for a variety of business purposes: 
determining credit limits for credit card applicants, monitoring machinery in a plant to 
predict potential problems or breakdowns, making mortgage loans, and determining opti-
mal plant layouts. They are typically developed by capturing the knowledge of recognized 
experts in a field whether within a business itself or outside it.
Computer Hardware and Software
It may be hard to believe, but only a few decades ago computers were considered exotic 
curiosities, used only for very specialized applications and understood by only a few people. 
The first commercial computer, UNIVAC I, was sold to the U.S. Census Bureau in the 
early 1950s. It cost $1 million, took up most of a room, and could perform about 2,000 
calculations per second.4 The invention of transistors and then integrated circuits (micro-
chips) quickly led to smaller and more powerful devices. By the 1980s, computers could rou-
tinely perform several million calculations per second. Now, computers perform billions of 
calculations per second, and some fit in the palm of your hand.
When the first personal computers were introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
the idea of a computer on every desk, or in every home, seemed far-fetched. Today they have 
become indispensable to both businesses and households. Not only have computers become 
much more powerful and faster over the past 25 years, but they are less expensive as well. 
IBM’s first personal computer (PC), introduced in 1981, cost well over $5,000 fully config-
ured. Today, the typical PC sells for under $800.
Types of Computer Hardware
Hardware consists of all tangible elements of a computer system—the input devices, the 
components that store and process data and perform required calculations, and the output 
devices that present the results to information users. Input devices allow users to enter data 
and commands for processing, storage, and output. The most common input devices are the 
keyboard and mouse. Storage and processing components consist of the hard drive as well as 
various other storage components, including DVD drives and flash memory devices. Flash 
memory devices are becoming increasingly popular because they are small and can hold large 
amounts of data. Some, called thumb drives, can even fit on a keychain. To gain access to the 
data they hold, users just plug them into an unused USB (universal serial bus) port, standard 
on today’s computers. Output devices, such as monitors and printers, are the hardware ele-
ments that transmit or display documents and other results of a computer system’s work.
Different types of computers incorporate widely varying memory capacities and pro-
cessing speeds. These differences define four broad classifications: mainframe computers, 
midrange systems, personal computers, and hand-held devices. A mainframe computer is the 
largest type of computer system with the most extensive storage capacity and the fastest pro-
cessing speeds. Especially powerful mainframes called supercomputers can handle extremely 
rapid, complex calculations involving thousands of variables, such as weather modeling and 
forecasting. Today’s supercomputers can perform a trillion or more calculations per second.
Midrange systems consist of high-end network servers and other types of computers that 
can handle large-scale processing needs. They are less powerful than mainframe computers

but more powerful than most personal computers. A server is the heart of a midrange com-
puter network, supporting applications and allowing the sharing of output devices, software, 
and databases among networked users. Many Internet-related functions at organizations are 
handled by midrange systems. Midrange systems are also commonly employed in process 
control systems, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and computer-aided design (CAD).
Personal computers are everywhere today—in homes, businesses, schools, nonprofit 
organizations, and government agencies. Recent estimates of PC ownership say that more 
than two-thirds of American households have at least one personal computer. They have 
earned increasing popularity because of their ever-expanding capability to handle many of 
the functions that large mainframes performed only a few decades ago. Most desktop com-
puters are linked to networks, such as the Internet.
Desktop computers used to be the standard PC seen in offices and homes. While mil-
lions of desktop computers remain on the job, notebook computers now account for more 
than half of all new PCs sold. The increasing popularity of notebooks can be explained by 
their lower prices, improved displays, faster processing speeds, larger storage capacities, and 
more durable designs. At the same time they are becoming more powerful, notebooks have 
never been lighter or thinner. For many users, the size, weight, and portability of notebooks 
offsets the fact that notebooks still cost more than comparable desktop computers.
One of the newest types of notebook computer is the netbook. These devices are very 
small and inexpensive; some cost less than $300. While they don’t have the computing capa-
bility of the larger, more expensive notebooks, netbooks can still perform basic tasks (such as 
e-mail, word processing, and spreadsheet calculations) and can access the Internet through a 
wireless connection.
Hand-held devices—made by companies such as Apple, RIM, Nokia, Palm, and 
Samsung—are even smaller. Two kinds of hand-held devices are available to most business and 
consumer users. The original type is the personal digital assistant (PDA). PDAs keep schedules 
and contact information and have limited software applications such as word processing and 
spreadsheets. Most PDAs today allow users to access the Internet through wireless networks.
The other type of hand-held device is the 
smart phone. A smart phone is essentially a device 
that combines a cell phone with a PDA. Examples 
include Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android, RIM’s 
BlackBerry, and Samsung’s BlackJack. In addition to 
making and receiving calls and text messages, smart 
phones allow users to surf the Internet, receive and 
send e-mail, check their schedules, and even open 
and edit documents. On short trips, many business-
people find that they just rely on their smart phone. 
Given their added capability, it’s not surprising that 
smart phone sales are growing much faster than sales 
of traditional PDAs. Moreover, most of the recent 
overall growth in the sale of cell phones can be 
attributed to smart phones.5
While smart phones can be terrific tools that 
boost productivity, some people overuse or even 
misuse them. The “Business Etiquette” feature

in a business environment.

In addition to PDAs and smart phones, special-
ized hand-held devices are used in a variety of busi-
nesses for different applications. Some restaurants, 
for example, have small wireless devices that allow 
servers to swipe a credit card and print out a receipt 
right at the customer’s table. Drivers for UPS and 
FedEx use special hand-held devices to track package 
deliveries and accept delivery signatures. The driver 
scans each package as it is delivered, and the infor-
mation is transmitted to the delivery firm’s network. 
Within a few seconds, the sender, using an Internet 
connection, can obtain the delivery information and 
even see a facsimile of the recipient’s signature.
Computer Software
Software includes all of the programs, routines, 
and computer languages that control a computer and 
tell it how to operate. The software that controls the 
basic workings of a computer system is its operating 
system. More than 90 percent of personal computers 
use a version of Microsoft’s popular Windows oper-
ating system. Personal computers made by Apple use 
the Mac operating system. Most hand-held devices 
use either the Palm or Symbian operating system 
or a special version of Windows called Windows 
Mobile. But the Droid, iPhone, and BlackBerry 
models have their own operating systems. Other 
operating systems include Unix, which runs on many 
midrange computer systems, and Linux, which runs 
on both PCs and midrange systems.
A program that performs the specific tasks that 
the user wants to carry out—such as writing a letter or 
looking up data—is called application software. Examples 
of application software include Adobe Acrobat, 
Microsoft PowerPoint, and Quicken. Table 14.1 lists 
the major categories of application software. Most 
application programs are currently stored on individual 
computers. As the chapter’s opening vignette dis-
cussed, the future of applications software is constantly 
changing. Some believe much of it will eventually 
become Web based, with the programs themselves 
stored in the “cloud,” on Internet-connected servers. 
Others disagree, arguing that most computer users will 
not want to rely on an Internet connection to perform 
tasks such as preparing a spreadsheet using Microsoft 
Excel. The “Going Green” feature explains how some

Courteous Communications via Wireless Devices
According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources, cell phone 
use in America has skyrocketed from about 3.5 million subscribers to about 
285 million in a decade. With so many of us communicating instantly—and 
almost constantly—it is more important than ever to be courteous, whether 
speaking or e-mailing on a hand-held device.
1 
Be aware of your surroundings—and your neighbors. If you’re in a meeting or other 
place where a separate conversation would be disruptive, turn your ring-
tone off. If the call or e-mail simply can’t wait, excuse yourself and leave 
the room before responding to it.
2 
Lower your voice when you’re talking in public. If the room you are in is quieter 
than your speaking voice, it’s better to go somewhere else.
3 
When sending e-mail or texting, don’t overabbreviate. A business message can be 
concise without being cute or, worse, unintelligible. It is just as easy to 
say “See you at 3” as “cu@3.”
4 
Before you send a text message or e-mail, read it over carefully. Typos and grammati-
cal errors don’t look good, especially in a business message.
5 
Be careful about your Facebook proﬁ le photo. Now that smart phones let users link 
all their contact information, your photo will appear on the other person’s 
phone when you call. And people beyond those on your “friends” list will 
see it. Be sure your photo is appropriate for both friends and business 
callers.

Computer Networks
As mentioned earlier, virtually all computers today are linked to networks. In fact, if 
your PC has Internet access, you’re linked to a network. Local area networks and wide 
area networks allow businesses to communicate, transmit and print documents, and share 
data. These networks, however, require businesses to install special equipment and 
connections between office sites. But Internet technology has also been applied to internal 
company communications and business tasks, tapping a ready-made network. Among these 
new Internet-based applications are intranets, virtual private networks (VPNs), and voice 
over Internet protocol (VoIP). Each has contributed to the effectiveness and speed of busi-
ness processes, so we discuss them next.
Local Area Networks and Wide Area Networks
Most organizations connect their offices and buildings by creating local area networks 
(LANs), computer networks that connect machines within limited areas, such as a building 
or several nearby buildings. LANs are useful because they link computers and allow them to 
share printers, documents, and information, as well as provide access to the Internet. 
Figure 14.1 shows what a small business computer network might look like.
Wide area networks (WANs) tie larger geographical regions together by using tele-
phone lines and microwave and satellite transmission. One familiar WAN is long-distance

Can Cloud Computing Also Be “Green” Computing?
The rise in cloud computing has some observers hoping it will 
decrease the emission of greenhouse gases. However, others are 
increasingly concerned that it will cause emissions to increase because 
it will require larger and larger data storage centers that use more 
energy.
The environmental organization Greenpeace recently issued the 
“Cool IT Challenge” to the IT sector. Greenpeace urges these firms to 
reduce emissions by using renewable electricity to power their data cen-
ters and to pressure utility companies to improve access to renewable 
energy. In a recent report, Greenpeace declared that IT energy solutions 
can even encourage the growth of local, decentralized energy centers 
as opposed to large grids. These smaller, local networks could result in 
better energy choices for consumers as well as improved efficiency and 
more use of renewable energy.
Greenpeace has also published a chart that rates major data cen-
ters’ use of power sources. Google’s data center in Oregon was the 
leading user of renewable energy, with almost 51 percent of its energy 
coming from renewable sources as opposed to coal and nuclear power.
The Green Grid, a group of IT companies interested in improving 
energy efficiency, recently launched a downloadable tool that helps IT 
professionals lower overall energy use by using outside air and water to 
cool their data centers at little or no cost.
Even Greenpeace has come under fire for relying on coal and 
nuclear energy at some of its data centers, due to long-term agree-
ments with local utilities. Gary Cook, one of the Cool IT Campaign’s 
policy advisors, declared, “We’re definitely trying to run the greenest 
operation we can. . . . We’re in the process of reworking some of our IT 
infrastructure, and we’ll clean that up.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Why do you think devices such as smart phones or the 
iPad, which rely on cloud computing, might contribute to 
increased greenhouse gas emissions?
2. Do you think that data centers’ voluntary actions will be 
enough to lower greenhouse gas emissions? Why or why 
not?

telephone service. Companies such as AT&T and Verizon provide WAN services to busi-
nesses and consumers. Firms also use WANs to conduct their own operations. Typically, 
companies link their own network systems to outside communications equipment and ser-
vices for transmission across long distances.
Wireless Local Networks
A wireless network allows computers, printers, 
and other devices to be connected without the hassle 
of stringing cables in traditional office settings. The 
current standard for wireless networks is called WiFi. 
WiFi—short for wireless fidelity—is a wireless network 
that connects various devices and allows them to 
communicate with one another through radio waves. 
Any PC with a WiFi receptor can connect with the 
Internet at so-called hot spots—locations with a 
wireless router and a high-speed Internet modem. 
There are almost hundreds of thousands of hot spots 
worldwide today. They are found in a variety of 
places, including airports, libraries, and coffee shops. 
Examples include Panera Bread’s 1,300 bakery-cafes 
in the United States and Kansai International Airport 
in Osaka, Japan. Some locations provide free access, 
while others charge a fee.

Many believe that the successor to WiFi will be 
Wi-Max. Unlike WiFi’s relatively limited geographic 
coverage area—generally around 300 feet—a single 
Wi-Max access point can provide coverage over 
many miles. In addition, cell phone service providers, 
such as Sprint Nextel and AT&T, offer broadband 
network cards for notebook PCs. These devices allow 
users to access the provider’s mobile broadband net-
work from virtually any location where cell phone 
reception is available.
Intranets
A broad approach to sharing information in an 
organization is to establish a company network pat-
terned after the Internet. Such a network is called an 
intranet. Intranets are similar to the Internet, but 
they limit access to employees or other authorized 
users. An intranet blocks outsiders without valid 
passwords from entering its network by incorporat-
ing both software and hardware known as a firewall. 
Firewalls limit data transfers to certain locations and 
log system use so that managers can identify attempts 
to log on with invalid passwords and other threats 
to a system’s security. Highly sophisticated packages 
immediately alert system administrators about suspi-
cious activities and permit authorized personnel to 
use smart cards to connect from remote terminals.
Intranets solve the problem of linking different types of computers. Like the Internet, 
intranets can integrate computers running all kinds of operating systems. In addition, 
intranets are relatively easy and inexpensive to set up because most businesses already have 
some of the required hardware and software. For instance, a small business can simply pur-
chase a DSL router and a few cables and create an intranet using phone jacks and internal 
phone lines. All the business’s computers will be linked with each other and with the Internet.
Intranets also support teamwork among employees who travel or work from home. Any 
intranet member with the right identification, a PC, and some sort of Internet connection—
either dial-up or broadband—can link to the intranet and gain access to group calendars, 
e-mail, documents, and other files. Intranets can also be used for videoconferencing and 
other forms of virtual meetings. Jetstar, an airline serving the Asian Pacific region, has more 
than 3,000 employees. But three-quarters of them—pilots, cabin crews, and airport staff, 
for example—will never go to the home office. Via the company’s intranet, pilots can access 
constantly changing safety information, and home office employees can update the staff 
directory and transfer paper forms online. Corporate and staff communications, transmitted 
to all employees via Jetstar’s intranet, help build a sense of community.6
Virtual Private Networks
To gain increased security for Internet communications, companies often turn to vir-
tual private networks (VPNs), secure connections between two points on the Internet.

These VPNs use firewalls and programs that encapsulate data to make them more secure 
during transit. Loosely defined, a VPN can include a range of networking technologies, 
from secure Internet connections to private networks from service providers like IBM. A 
VPN is cheaper for a company to use than leasing several of its own lines. It can also take 
months to install a leased line in some parts of the world, but a new user can be added to a 
VPN in a day. Because a VPN uses the Internet, it can be wired, wireless, or a combination 
of the two.
Colorado-based Advanced Systems Group (ASG) provides data storage and management 
services to other companies. As the company expanded and opened branch offices, its own 
security became a concern. ASG turned to Check Point, which created a secure VPN con-
necting ASG’s home office and five branch offices. The VPN allows ASG to add new sites 
and new remote users automatically.7
VoIP
VoIP—which stands for voice over Internet Protocol—is an alternative to traditional tele-
communication services provided by companies such as Verizon and Qwest. The VoIP 
telephone is not connected to a traditional phone jack but rather is connected to a personal 
computer with any type of broadband connection. Special software transmits phone conver-
sations over the Internet, rather than through telephone lines. A VoIP user dials the phone 
as usual. The person can make and receive calls to and from those with traditional telephone 
connections (landline or wireless).
A growing number of consumers and businesses have embraced VoIP, mainly due to its 
cost savings and extra features. As technology continues to advance, demand for the service 
has increased. AT&T and Verizon Wireless recently announced that they would permit 
VoIP on some smartphones, and Google is developing its own VoIP service. The various 
VoIP providers are working together with the goal of creating a single VoIP standard that 
would permit seamless roaming worldwide.8
In spite of VoIP’s apparent advantages, there are several potential drawbacks to 
replacing traditional telephony with Internet telephony. For one thing, your Internet 
phone service will be only as reliable as your broadband connection. If your broadband 
connection goes out, so will your phone service. Also, without extensive safeguards, VoIP 
can expose a phone system to the havoc that can affect the rest of the Internet, such as 
worms and viruses.
Security and Ethical Issues 
Affecting Information Systems
Numerous security and ethical issues affect information systems. As information systems 
become increasingly important business assets, they also become progressively harder and 
more expensive to replace. Damage to information systems or theft of data can have disas-
trous consequences. When computers are connected to a network, a problem at any indi-
vidual computer can affect the entire network. Two of the major security threats are e-crime 
and so-called malware.

E-Crime
Computers provide efficient ways for employees to share information. But they may 
also allow people with more malicious intentions to access information. Or they may allow 
pranksters—who have no motive other than to see whether they can hack into a system—to 
gain access to private information. Common e-crimes involve stealing or altering data in sev-
eral ways:
 
• Employees or outsiders may change or invent data to produce inaccurate or misleading 
information.
 • Employees or outsiders may modify computer programs to create false information or 
illegal transactions or to insert viruses.
 • Unauthorized people can access computer systems for their own benefit or knowledge or 
just to see if they can get in.
Individuals, businesses, and government agencies are all vulnerable to computer crime. 
Computer hackers—unauthorized users—sometimes work alone and sometimes work in 
groups. Hackers can break into computer systems just to show that they can do it; other 
times they have more sinister motives. A recent survey reported that although computer 
crime decreased slightly recently, the majority of such attacks may go undetected, because 
many firms have concentrated on foiling hackers and blocking pornography while leaving 
themselves open to cybercriminals who are developing increasingly sophisticated weapons. 
Even Apple computers, normally immune to cybercrime, are becoming vulnerable as more 
and more Mac users store data in the “cloud”—that is, on the Internet itself—rather than on 
hard drives. Until now there has been no single uniform system for reporting cyber crime, 
but the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is working toward a common format that 
will have reliable time stamps, will be available in different languages, and will allow users 
to attach samples of malicious code. These automated tools will be able to analyze massive 
amounts of data much faster than human analysts can.9
Information system administrators implement two basic protections against computer 
crime: they try to prevent access to their systems by unauthorized users and the viewing 
of data by unauthorized system users. The simplest method of preventing access requires 
authorized users to enter passwords. The company may also install firewalls, described 
earlier. To prevent system users from reading sensitive information, the company may use 
encryption software, which encodes, or scrambles, messages. To read encrypted messages, 
users must use an electronic key to convert them to regular text. But as fast as software 
developers invent new and more elaborate protective measures, hackers seem to break 
through their defenses. Thus, security is an ongoing battle.
Another form of computer theft is as old as crime itself: theft of equipment. And because 
these machines may contain all kinds of important information for a business, employees 
need to be especially careful not to leave them unattended or within easy reach of others. 
Recently, someone stole 57 hard drives from a BlueCross BlueShield office in Chattanooga, 
Tennessee. Stored on the hard drives were 1 million customer support calls, about 50,000 
hours of phone conversations. Although most of the customers did not reveal enough per-
sonal information for effective identity theft, Medicare subscribers had to give their Social 
Security numbers—which can be used in identity theft. The hard drives also contained about 
300,000 screen shots of callers’ information, which the BlueCross employees had brought up 
on screen while speaking with them. Many of the screen shots show callers’ Social Security

numbers. The only way for BlueCross BlueShield to identify customers whose information 
was compromised has been to review each of the audio and video files individually.10
As the size of computer hardware diminishes, it becomes increasingly vulnerable to 
theft. Hand-held devices, for instance, can easily vanish with a pickpocket or purse snatcher. 
Many notebook computers and hand-held devices contain special security software or pass-
words that makes it difficult for a thief or any unauthorized person to access the data stored 
in the computer’s memory. If you have a notebook computer that contains sensitive personal 
information, you should consider having such safeguards.
Computer Viruses, Worms, 
Trojan Horses, and Spyware
Viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware, collectively referred to as malware, are 
malicious software programs designed to infect computer systems. These programs can 
destroy data, steal sensitive information, and even render information systems inoperable. 
Recently, malware has been discovered in advertisements on major sites such as Yahoo, 
Fox, and Google as well as The New York Times and WhitePages.com. Malware attacks cost 
consumers and businesses billions of dollars annually. Although law enforcement has made 
progress against cybercrime, some observers predict that cybercriminals will target social-
networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.11
Computer viruses are programs that secretly attach themselves to other programs 
(called hosts) and change them or destroy data. According to the computer security company 
Symantec, there are currently almost 3 million active computer viruses worldwide.12 Viruses 
can be programmed to become active immediately or to remain dormant for a period of 
time, after which the infections suddenly activate themselves and cause problems. A virus can 
reproduce by copying itself onto other programs stored in the same drive. It spreads as users 
install infected software on their systems or exchange files with others, usually by exchanging 
e-mail, accessing electronic bulletin boards, trading disks, or downloading programs or data 
from unknown sources on the Internet.
A worm is a small piece of software that exploits a security hole in a network to rep-
licate itself. A copy of the worm scans the network for another machine that has a specific 
security hole. It copies itself to the new machine using the security hole and then starts 
replicating from there as well. Unlike viruses, worms don’t need host programs to damage 
computer systems.
A botnet is a network of PCs that have been infected with one or more data-stealing 
viruses. Computer criminals tie the infected computers into a network, often without the 
owners being aware of it, and sell the botnet on the black market. They or others use the 
botnet to commit identity theft, send spam, buy blocks of concert tickets for scalping, and 
attack the Internet itself. About 4,000 to 6,000 botnets are active today. Spanish authorities 
recently brought down the Mariposa botnet, the world’s largest to date, a network of 12.7 
million infected computers. Some of the computers were inside Fortune 1,000 companies and 
major banks. Although the authorities made some arrests, the creator of the Mariposa botnet 
has not been caught.13
A Trojan horse is a program that claims to do one thing but in reality does 
something else, usually something malicious. For example, a Trojan horse might claim,

and even appear, to be a game. When an unsuspecting user clicks on the Trojan horse to 
launch it, the program might erase the hard drive or steal any personal data stored on the 
computer.
Spyware is software that secretly gathers user information through the user’s Internet 
connection without his or her knowledge, usually for advertising purposes. Spyware appli-
cations are typically bundled with other programs downloaded from the Internet. Once 
installed, the spyware monitors user activity on the Internet and transmits that information 
in the background to someone else.
Attacks by malware are not limited to computers and computer networks; hand-held 
devices, including cell phones, have been affected as well. Smart phone users have reported a 
sharp increase in viruses, worms, and other forms of malware.14
Recently, a group of computer scientists cracked the security system that is used in 80 
percent of the world’s cell phones. The scientists said it was relatively easy and that they did 
it to encourage development of more sophisticated security.15
As viruses, worms, botnets, and Trojan horses become more complex, the technology 
to fight them must increase in sophistication as well. The simplest way to protect against 
computer viruses is to install one of the many available antivirus software programs, such 
as Norton AntiVirus and McAfee VirusScan. These programs, which also protect against 
worms and some Trojan horses, continuously monitor systems for viruses and automatically 
eliminate any they spot. Users should regularly update them by downloading the latest virus 
definitions. In addition, computer users should also install and regularly update antispyware 
programs because many Trojan horses are forms of spyware.
But management must begin to emphasize security at a deeper level: during software 
design, in corporate servers, at Web gateways, and through Internet service providers. 
Because more than 90 percent of the world’s PCs run on Microsoft operating systems, a 
single virus, worm, or Trojan horse can spread among them quickly. Individual computer 
users should carefully choose the files they load onto their systems, scan their systems regu-
larly, make sure their antivirus software is up to date, and install software only from known 
sources. They should also be very careful when opening attachments to e-mails because 
many viruses, worms, and Trojan horses are spread that way.
Information Systems and Ethics
The scope and power of today’s information systems not surprisingly raise a number of 
ethical issues and concerns. These affect both employees and organizations. For instance, it 
is not uncommon for organizations to have specific ethical standards and policies regarding 
the use of information systems by employees and vendors. These standards include obliga-
tions to protect system security and the privacy and confidentiality of data. Policies also may 
cover the personal use of computers and related technologies, both hardware and software, 
by employees.
Ethical issues also involve organizational use of information systems. Organizations have 
an obligation to protect the privacy and confidentiality of data about employees and custom-
ers. Employment records contain sensitive personal information, such as bank account num-
bers, which, if not protected, could lead to identity theft. Another ethical issue is the use of 
computer technology to monitor employees while they are working. The “Solving an Ethical 
Controversy” feature debates the issue of employee monitoring further.

According to an American Management Association/ePolicy 
Institute survey, two-thirds of employers monitor employees’ use of the 
Internet. Technology now allows them to check Web sites their employ-
ees visit on company time, keystrokes on individual computers, and the 
amount of time spent online. Employers can even track employees with 
GPS-enabled phones.
On-the-job access to the Internet and e-mail is indispensable. A 
certain amount of Internet surfing for research purposes is necessary in 
some fields. A company’s Facebook page can be either a powerful mar-
keting tool or a liability if employees use their own social media sites to 
complain about the company.
Should employers monitor their employees’ time 
online?
Summary
Although federal law clearly gives employers the right to monitor computer activity, a case pending 
before the U.S. Supreme Court concerns the permissible range of monitoring a worker’s use of a company-
provided electronic device. Most analysts suggest that companies should establish clear policies on com-
puter, Internet, and e-mail use; train employees and have them sign a document saying they understand 
those policies; and then trust their employees.

Disaster Recovery and Backup
Natural disasters, power failures, equipment malfunctions, software glitches, human 
error, and terrorist attacks can disrupt even the most sophisticated computer information 
systems. These disruptions can cost businesses and other organizations billions of dollars. 
Even more serious consequences can occur. For example, one recent study found that more 
than 93 percent of firms that lost their data centers for ten days or more went bankrupt 
within six months.16
Strand Associates, a multibranch civil engineering firm headquartered in Madison, 
Wisconsin, faced the challenge of ensuring reliable backups and data protection. Backups 
were in the form of magnetic tapes made weekly by local office personnel and sent to the 
home office. For data retrieval, branch offices had to request the home office to ship the 
physical magnetic tapes. The company’s IT team spent many hours fixing hardware or

tracking down lost tapes. Strand turned to FalconStor, an 
IT firm that specializes in servicing engineering companies. 
FalconStor met Strand’s needs by setting up a system of double 
backups made hourly and stored on remote servers before being 
transferred to tape and stored off site. Data from local offices are 
duplicated to FalconStor hardware in Wisconsin, and data from 
the Wisconsin office are duplicated to a FalconStor appliance 
in Illinois. All files are also backed up weekly. Strand’s network 
engineer, Justin Bell, explains, “This setup allows us to keep an 
offsite copy of everything, so that all of our data is protected.”17
Disaster recovery planning—deciding how to prevent system 
failures and continue operations if computer systems fail—is a 
critical function of all organizations. Disaster prevention pro-
grams can avoid some of these costly problems. The most basic 
precaution is routinely backing up software and data—at the 
organizational and individual levels. However, the organization’s 
data center cannot be the sole repository of critical data because 
a single location is vulnerable to threats from both natural and 
human-caused disasters. Consequently, off-site data backup is a 
necessity, whether in a separate physical location or online on 
the Internet itself. Companies that perform online backups store 
the encrypted data in secure facilities that in turn have their own 
backups. The initial backup may take a day or more, but subse-
quent ones take far less time because they involve only new or 
modified files.
According to security experts, there are five important tasks 
regarding off-site data storage. First is planning. The organiza-
tion needs to decide what data need to be protected. Priority should be given to data having 
severe legal or business consequences should they be lost. Second, a backup schedule must 
be established and closely adhered to. Third, when data are transmitted off site, they must be 
protected by the highest level of security possible. Fourth, care should be taken in selecting 
the right security vendor. There are dozens of vendors offering different services and hav-
ing different areas of expertise. Finally, the backup system should be continually tested and 
evaluated.
Information System Trends
Computer information systems are constantly—and rapidly—evolving. To keep their 
information systems up-to-date, firms must continually keep abreast of changes in technol-
ogy. Some of the most significant trends in information systems today include the growing 
demands of the so-called distributed workforce, the increased use of application service pro-
viders, on-demand computing, and cloud and grid computing.
The Distributed Workforce
As discussed in earlier chapters, many companies are relying more and more on a distrib-

called virtual offices, including at home. Information technology makes a distributed work-
force possible. Computers, networks, and other components of information systems allow 
many workers the ability to do their jobs effectively almost anywhere. For instance, none of 
JetBlue’s reservations agents work in offices; they all work at home, connected to the air-
line’s information system. JetBlue is hardly alone in its use of home-based workers. Boeing, 
Starbucks, Agilent Technologies, Sun Microsystems, and many other companies maintain 
“virtual” offices with thousands of workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS), about 10 percent of full-time wage and salary workers work at home on any given day. 
Of the self-employed, more than one-third work at home on any given day.18 The BLS statis-
tics show that the vast majority of at-home workers use computers and related technologies. 
Virtual offices range from a mailing address, mail forwarding, and a phone answering service 
to a full office, usually leased by the month. The increasing demands of the distributed work-
force will likely lead to more innovative and increasingly powerful information systems.
Application Service Providers
As with other business functions, many firms find that outsourcing at least some of their 
information technology function makes sense. Because of the increasing cost and complexity 
of obtaining and maintaining information systems, many firms hire an application service 
provider (ASP), an outside supplier that provides both the computers and the application 
support for managing an information system. An ASP can simplify complex software for its 
customers so that it is easier for them to manage and use. When an ASP relationship is suc-
cessful, the buyer can then devote more time and resources to its core businesses instead of 
struggling to manage its information systems. Other benefits include stretching the firm’s 
technology dollar farther and giving smaller companies the kind of information power that 
in the past was available only to much larger organizations. Even large companies turn to 
ASPs to manage some or all of their information systems. Recently, Microsoft outsourced 
much of its internal information technology (IT) services to Infosys Technology to save 
money and streamline, simplify, and support its services.19
Companies that decide to use ASPs should check the backgrounds and references of 
these firms before hiring them to manage critical systems. In addition, customers should try 
to ensure that the service provider has strong security measures to block computer hackers 
or other unauthorized access to the data, that its data centers are running reliably, and that 
adequate data and applications backups are maintained.
On-Demand, Cloud, and Grid Computing
Another recent trend is on-demand computing, also called utility computing. Instead of 
purchasing and maintaining expensive software, firms essentially rent the software time from 
application providers and pay only for their usage of the software, similar to purchasing elec-
tricity from a utility. On-demand computing is particularly useful for firms that experience 
annual peaks in demand or seasonal spikes in customer usage of their applications. By rent-
ing the service they need only when they need it, they can avoid buying the software that is 
not routinely required. On-demand computing can also help companies remain current with 
the most efficient software on the market without purchasing huge upgrades.
Cloud computing uses powerful servers to store applications software and databases. 
Users access the software and databases via the Web using anything from a PC to a smart 
phone. The software as a service (SaaS) movement is an example of cloud computing.

The “Hit & Miss” feature describes how Cisco Systems provides security for cloud-based 
applications.
Small and medium-size companies occasionally find themselves with jobs that require 
more computing power than their current systems offer. A cost-effective solution for these 
firms may be something called grid computing, which consists of a network of smaller 
computers running special software. The software breaks down a large, complex job into 
smaller tasks and then distributes them to the networked computers. The software then 
reassembles the individual task results into the finished job. By combining multiple small 
computers, grid computing creates a virtual mainframe or even a supercomputer.
What’s Ahead
This is the first of two chapters devoted to managing technology and information. The 
next chapter, “Understanding Accounting and Financial Statements,” focuses on account-
ing, financial information, and financing reporting. Accounting is the process of measuring, 
interpreting, and communicating financial information to enable people inside and outside 
the firm to make informed decisions. The chapter describes the functions of accounting and 
role of accountants; the steps in the accounting cycle; the types, functions, and components 
of financial statements; and the role of budgets in an organization.

More and more businesses find themselves managing increasing 
amounts of e-mail and storing increasing amounts of data. Many save 
money and physical space by turning to cloud computing and storage, 
including software as a service (SaaS). Rather than installing software 
on site, with SaaS a business gains access to software over the Internet 
either by subscription or by a “pay as you go” plan. These businesses 
also need to protect their databanks from computer crime. In a tra-
ditional local area network, it is relatively easy to implement security 
applications at the network’s borders. But in the borderless environ-
ment of cloud computing and with threats to security increasing, meet-
ing this challenge is more difficult.
Cisco Systems has responded by developing security applications 
for cloud-based computing. One application directs a business’s Web 
traffic to security towers located in 100 countries around the world. 
These locations use layers of antivirus and antimalware utilities to scan 
Web sites and quickly block access to them if they are compromised.
Another application offers both cloud-based and on-site e-mail 
security. The cloud-based application deletes spam and viruses. The on-
site application provides data-loss prevention, e-mail encryption, and 
other services. Another e-mail encryption service provides cloud-based 
encryption for locally stored messages.
Other apps support security for off-site workers using desktops, 
laptops, tablets, and smart phones. One feature addresses the problem 
that occurs when an employee leaves a business. With one click of the 
mouse, an administrator can disable that person’s access to every SaaS 
application he or she ever used. Also with one click, the administrator 
can enable access for a new employee.
As the vice president and general manager of Cisco’s security 
technology unit states, “Securing the cloud is highly challenging. But it 
is one of the top challenges that the industry must rise to meet.”

Summary of Learning Goals
Distinguish between data and information, and explain the 
role of information systems in business.
It is important for businesspeople to know the difference 
between data and information. Data are raw facts and fig-
ures that may or may not be relevant to a business decision. 
Information is knowledge gained from processing those facts 
and figures. An information system is an organized method 
for collecting, storing, and communicating past, present, and 
projected information on internal operations and external 
intelligence. Most information systems today use computer 
and telecommunications technology.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 Distinguish between data and information. Data 
consist of raw facts and figures that may or may not be rel-
evant to a decision. Information is the knowledge gained 
from processing data.
1.2 What is an information system? An information 
system is an organized method for collecting, storing, 
and communicating past, present, and projected 
information on internal operations and external 
intelligence.
List the components and different types of information 
systems.
When people think about information systems today, 
they’re generally thinking about computer-based systems, 
those that rely on computers and related technologies. 
Computer-based information systems rely on four compo-
nents: computer hardware, software, telecommunications 
and computer networks, and data resource management. 
The heart of an information system is its database, a cen-
tralized integrated collection of data resources. Information 
systems fall into two broad categories: operational support 
systems and management support systems. Operational 
support systems are designed to produce a variety of infor-
mation for users. Examples include transaction processing 
systems and process control systems. Management support 
systems are those designed to support effective decision 
making. They include management information systems, 
decision support systems, executive support systems, and 
expert systems.
Assessment Check Answers 
2.1 List the four components of a computer-based 
information system. The four components of a computer-
based information system are computer hardware, software, 
telecommunications and computer networks, and data 
resource management.
2.2 What is a database? A database is a centralized, inte-
grated collection of data resources.
2.3 What are the two general types of information 
systems? Give examples of each. The two categories of 
information systems are operational support systems (such 
as transactions processing and process control systems) and 
management support systems (such as management informa-
tion, decision support, executive support, and expert systems).
Outline how computer hardware and software are used to 
manage information.
Hardware consists of all tangible elements of a computer 
system, including input and output devices. Major categories 
of computers include mainframes, supercomputers, midrange 
systems, personal computers (PCs), and hand-held devices. 
Computer software provides the instructions that tell the 
hardware what to do. The software that controls the basic 
workings of the computer is its operating system. Other pro-
grams, called application software, perform specific tasks that 
users want to complete.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 List two input and output devices. Input devices 
include the keyboard and mouse. Output devices include the 
monitor and printer.
3.2 What accounts for the increasing popularity of 
notebook computers? Notebook computers account for 
more than half of all new personal computers sold. Their 
increased popularity is due to better displays, lower prices, 
more rugged designs, increasing computing power, and 
slimmer designs.
3.3 What is software? List the two categories of soft-
ware. Computer software provides the instructions that 
tell the hardware what to do. The software that controls 
the basic workings of the computer is its operating system. 
Other programs, called application software, perform spe-
cific tasks that users want to complete.
Describe networking and telecommunications technology 
and the types of computer networks.
Local area networks connect computers within a limited 
area. Wide area networks tie together larger geographical 
regions by using telephone lines, microwave, or satellite 
transmission. A wireless network allows computers to com-
municate through radio waves. Intranets allow employees 
to share information on a ready-made company network. 
Access to an intranet is restricted to authorized users and 
is protected by a firewall. Virtual private networks (VPNs) 
provide a secure Internet connection between two or more 
points. VoIP—voice over Internet protocol—uses a personal 
computer running special software and a broadband Internet 
connection to make and receive telephone calls over the 
Internet rather than over traditional telephone networks.

4.2 What are the differences between an intranet and a 
VPN? An intranet is a computer network patterned after the 
Internet. Unlike the Internet, access to an intranet is limited 
to employees and other authorized users. A virtual private 
network (VPN) is a way of gaining increased security for 
Internet connections.
4.3 Briefly explain how VoIP works. The VoIP phone is 
connected to a personal computer with any type of broad-
band connection. Special software transmits phone conversa-
tions over the Internet. A VoIP user can make and receive 
calls to and from those with traditional telephone connec-
tions (either landline or wireless).
Discuss the security and ethical issues involving computer 
information systems.
Numerous security and ethical issues affect information 
systems. Two of the main security threats are e-crime and 
malware. E-crimes range from hacking—unauthorized pen-
etration of an information system—to the theft of hardware. 
Malware is any malicious software program designed to 
infect computer systems. Examples include viruses, worms, 
botnets, Trojan horses, and spyware. Ethical issues affecting 
information systems include the proper use of the systems 
by authorized users. Organizations also have an obligation 
to employees, vendors, and customers to protect the 
security and confidentiality of the data stored in 
information systems.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 Explain computer hacking. Computer hacking is 
a breach of a computer system by unauthorized people. 
Sometimes the hackers’ motive is just to see if they can get 
in. Other times, hackers have more sinister motives, includ-
ing stealing or altering data.
5.2 What is malware? Malware is any malicious software 
program designed to infect computer systems.
5.3 How does a computer virus work? A virus is a pro-
gram that secretly attaches itself to another program (called 
a host). The virus then changes the host, destroys data, or 
even makes the computer system inoperable.
Explain the steps that companies go through in anticipat-
ing, planning for, and recovering from information systems 
disasters.
Information system disasters, whether human caused or due 
to natural causes, can cost businesses billions of dollars. The 
consequences of a disaster can be minimized by routinely 
backing up software and data, both at an organizational level 
and at an individual level. Organizations should back up crit-
ical data at an off-site location. Some may also want to invest 
in extra hardware and software sites, which can be accessed 
during emergencies.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 What are the types of disasters to which informa-
tion systems are vulnerable? Natural disasters, power 
failures, equipment malfunctions, software glitches, human 
error, and even terrorist attacks can disrupt even the most 
powerful, sophisticated computer information systems.
6.2 List the tasks regarding off-site data storage. The 
five tasks are planning and deciding which data to back up, 
establishing and following a backup schedule, protecting data 
when they are transmitted off site, choosing the right ven-
dor, and continually testing and refining the backup system.
Review the current trends in information systems.
Information systems are continually and rapidly evolv-
ing. Some of the most significant trends are the increasing 
demands of the distributed workforce, the increased use of 
application service providers, on-demand computing, and 
grid computing. Many people now work in virtual offices, 
including at home. Information technology makes this pos-
sible. Application service providers allow organizations to 
outsource most of their IT functions. Rather than buying 
and maintaining expensive software, on-demand comput-
ing offers users the option of renting software time from 
outside vendors and paying only for their usage. Grid 
computing consists of a network of smaller computers run-
ning special software creating a virtual mainframe or even 
supercomputer.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 What is an application service provider? An appli-
cation service provider (ASP) is an outside vendor that 
provides both the computers and application support for 
managing an information system. By using an ASP, the 
organization effectively outsources some, or all, of its IT 
function.
7.2 Explain on-demand computing. Instead of purchas-
ing and maintaining expensive software, some organizations 
use on-demand computing. In this arrangement, software is 
rented from a vendor and the organization only pays for its 
actual usage.

Part 5  Managing Technology and Information
Major installations, such as resorts or sports stadiums, have 
requirements well beyond those of, say, a small office. They must be 
able to provide a safe and secure environment for events involving 
thousands, or even tens of thousands, of guests or fans. They need to 
keep track of reservations or ticket sales and ensure well-stocked dining 
facilities or concession stands. Certain companies have made a specialty 
of meeting the information-technology needs of such immense venues.
MICROS Systems, with headquarters in Maryland, is a leading 
developer of information technology systems for the hospitality industry, 
with 90 distributors in 50 countries. The company provides hardware 
and software solutions for 310,000 restaurant clients, from Burger King 
to Hilton Hotels in the United States. Its MICROS-Fidelio subsidiary has 
more than 25,000 installations around the world for the hotel chains 
Travelodge and InterContinental Hotels Group, among others. The com-
pany’s new MICROS-Retail group has enabled it to branch out into the 
retail industry, with clients such as Aéropostale, Starbucks, and IKEA.
One MICROS client is the M Resort Spa Casino in Las Vegas. 
This four-star resort has almost 400 hotel rooms and suites, a 
92,000-square-foot casino, nine restaurants and five separate bars, 
meeting and conference space, a full spa, and a large plaza for special 
events. The hardware and software that MICROS installed coordinates 
into a single-system, 120 point-of-sale workstations, including the res-
taurants, bars, wine cellar, room service, and many other services. The 
system’s hosted environment means lower emissions and use of elec-
tricity. MICROS’s disaster recovery helps the resort come back online 
from outages in less time and using fewer resources. The resort will be 
able to expand the scale of this technology without additional infra-
structure expenses as it plans for a large retail center and a 14-screen 
digital movie complex.
The Atlantis, Paradise Island resort in the Bahamas has used a 
MICROS hospitality management system package to institute a cashless 
environment. Previously, guests paid with cash or credit cards. The 
new system still allows credit card use but also offers another option. 
At check-in each guest is issued a magnetic-striped key card that 
operates the room door, keeps track of casino activity, and permits 
purchases. Each card has the guest’s name imprinted on it. At transac-
tions, employees ask the guest to confirm the room number. Guests no 
longer have to worry about keeping their cash secure. Revenues have 
increased, which also benefits the employees, who receive a percentage 
of each sale as a gratuity required by Bahamas law.
The New Meadowlands Stadium in New Jersey is twice as large 
as the stadium it replaced. With seating for 82,500, it is a showcase 
for the New York Giants and New Jersey Jets football teams, as well as 
for big-name concerts, college football, and international soccer. Due 
to a partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it is 
also one of the greenest American sports venues. MICROS Systems has 
installed hardware and software that will meet the large-scale require-
ments of the stadium. The hardware includes workstations, terminals, 
and hand-held devices. MICROS software applications manages the 
stadium’s inventory and purchasing, the luxury suites and their cater-
ing needs, and the dining facilities. Customer relations software tracks 
sales, recognizes season-ticket holders and other core clientele, and cul-
tivates new customers. Peter Brickman, the chief technology officer of 
the stadium, said, “The combination of innovative integrated solutions, 
advanced technology, security, reliable hardware, robust reporting, and 
open source friendly architecture made MICROS the only choice for our 
concession needs.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Visit the MICROS Systems Web site to learn more about its 
products for the global market. In what ways do you think 
the company can increase sales in Africa, Asia, and Latin 
America? How might the company have to adapt to condi-

2. Imagine you are the manager of a sports arena. What sorts 
of hardware and software would help you manage such a 
large facility?

Kaspersky Lab Busts Computer Bugs
Case 14.2
Businesses both large and small, as well as most 
people with home computers or smart phones, have had 
unfortunate experiences with computer viruses. Once a 
virus has infiltrated a network or a device—a computer, 
tablet, PDA, or cell phone—it replicates and begins caus-
ing irritating slowdowns or worse, destroying data or 
stealing a user’s identity.
Of the many software programs designed to catch 
and/or stop viruses and worms, those produced by 
Kaspersky Lab are among the most popular and the 
most effective. The company was founded by Russian-
born Eugene Kaspersky. Kaspersky, an engineer, became 
interested in computer viruses when his own computer 
was attacked by the notorious Cascade virus in 1989. 
He developed a disinfection utility for it, then went on to 
compile a catalog of viruses and disinfection utilities. This 
database now includes 4 million entries. In 1997, he and 
several colleagues founded Kaspersky Lab.
With headquarters in Moscow and branches world-
wide, the company has won many awards for its antivirus 
software packages. Only four years after establishing a 
presence in the Americas, Kaspersky Lab won an award 
for best e-mail security system. Today, Kaspersky Lab is 
the world’s largest privately held antimalware company, 
with products for both corporate networks and home PC 
users in almost every country in the world. More than 300 
million users rely on Kaspersky products for their security, 
and 150,000 new users join them every week.
One of Kaspersky Lab’s success stories involves the 
Austrian National Tourist Office, the country’s official 
tourist organization. It has 250 employees in 30 offices 
in Austria and in cities around the world, including New 
York, Sydney, Beijing, and Singapore. The tourist office’s 
international Web site has pages in many languages and 
showcases Austria’s many attractions for visitors. The 
office’s travel services are Web based, and its employees 
rely constantly on the Internet for online research and 
e-mail from their colleagues in different branches. Well 
aware of the growing worldwide risk of viruses and other 
malware, the tourist office decided it needed a better 
security system.
The tourist office consulted the Austrian IT subsidiary 
Austrian Info Systems GmbH, which decided that the best 
solution would be to adopt the entire range of products 
in the Kaspersky Anti-Virus Business Optimal package. 
From the tourist bureau’s home office in Vienna, the 
Kaspersky Administration Kit runs centralized monitoring 
and administration of all the office’s servers and all of 
its antivirus protection. Other Kaspersky antivirus utilities 
protect all of the 250 workstations worldwide, the 25 file 
servers, and the 550 mailboxes making up the exchange 
infrastructure. A free administration kit helps Austrian 
Info Systems make regular searches of the tourist office’s 
network for viruses.
For the home computer user, Kaspersky Lab offers 
programs that help prevent various forms of identity theft; 
offer protection against viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, 
and so on; and scan Web sites for malware. As more Mac 
users store data in the “cloud,” on Internet servers, their 
computers can also become infected with viruses and 
other malware, so Kaspersky Lab also offers a Mac ver-
sion of its antivirus software. And as smart phone users 
increasingly use their hand-held devices as PCs, they have 
a mobile security program as well.
As the company celebrated its 12th anniversary 
recently, its Web site declared that its “most valuable 
asset is the wealth of experience and knowledge it has 
gained in . . . combating viruses and other IT threats, 
enabling us to pre-empt trends in malware development. 
This helps us to remain one step ahead of the competition 
and provide our users with the most reliable protection 
from new types of attack.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Why is it so important for Kaspersky Lab—as 
a business—to stay ahead of new computer 
threats?
2. How do you protect your own computer or 
hand-held device from viruses and other 
malware? What steps would you take to 
improve your protection?

Zipcar: Technology Fuels Its Business
CASE 1.3
Case 14.3
When you need a car, you want one. When you 
don’t need a car, you don’t want to be bothered with 
the hassle or the expense. That’s what makes Zipcar so 
great. Zipcar is a car-sharing network based in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts that operates in urban and metropoli-
tan areas and on university campuses around the U.S., 
Canada, and the United Kingdom. Currently, Zipcar serves 
more than 200 colleges and universities, and the number 
is growing steadily. “The service provides a new level of 
freedom for students, faculty, and staff,” says Matthew 
Malloy, vice-president of international university opera-
tions for Zipcar. “Members can use Zipcars to run errands, 
attend meetings, or get away for the weekend on a pay-
as-you-go basis. You no longer need to own to be free.”
Once members sign up for the program, they receive 
a Zipcard that gives them access to any Zipcar parked 
around campus (or around town). The annual fee for 
the service is $35, and it includes fuel, insurance, and 
180 travel miles per day. A member who wants to use a 
Zipcar simply goes online to reserve it, then picks up the 
designated car at the reserved time. “It’s easy,” says Erin 
Badger, a senior marketing student at the University of 
New Hampshire, where the Zipcar program is now in full 
swing. “You swipe your Zipcard [over a sensor] on the 
windshield and it unlocks the car. You get in, turn the key, 
and go.” Each Zipcar comes equipped with an individually 
numbered Zipcard gas card that the driver uses to fill the 
tank with fuel. So members—especially budget-conscious 
students—don’t need cash or their own credit cards when 
the gas gauge runs low. Members are asked to return 
each car with at least one-quarter of a tank of gas in it, so 
no one picks up a car with an empty tank.
Technology plays a huge role in the success of the 
Zipcar system. “When you think about the member experi-
ence, what makes it a seamless and enjoyable experience 
for the consumer is the technology infrastructure,” observes 
Rob Weisberg, chief marketing officer at Zipcar. When mar-
keting and setting up the system at colleges and universities, 
Zipcar looks at how students use cars on campus, asking 
such questions as: Are there places on campus where use is 
more frequent, or do students want hybrids? “Any time you 
understand your consumers better, you are able to cater to 
them more effectively,” says Weisberg. He notes that Zipcar 
puts a lot of effort into understanding demographic and psy-
chographic (life style) trends on and around a campus.
Erin Badger likes the fact that she can use her iPhone 
app to reserve a Zipcar or extend the reservation if she is driv-
ing a car and isn’t ready to return it. “The iPhone app relates 
to the student age group,” she says. “They care about us.” 
The Zipcar app was named to Time magazine’s annual list of 
“Best Travel Gadgets” in one recent issue. “Beyond helping 
you manage reservations, find nearby pickup locations and 
browse car models available, the app offers clever capabilities 
like remote locking and unlocking and honking your car’s 
horn from your phone when you inevitably forget what it 
looks like in a crowded lot,” praises the Time review.
Zipcar is always looking toward the future and ways 
to better serve its customers. RobWeisberg predicts that 
eventually Zipcar technology will allow for customized 
seat settings and even pre-set radio station settings that 
automatically click into place when a member reserves 
a car. Still, Weisberg emphasizes the importance of the 
personal touch. He recalls that when a student member 
posted a note on Twitter joking that he loved everything 
about Zipcar except the fact that there wasn’t a package 
of Skittles waiting for him when he unlocked the car, a 
Zipcar employee left a package of Skittles on the dash-
board the next time the student reserved a car.
“Technology will never replace human interaction,” 
warns Weisberg. “You’d never take the recommendation 
of a computer over the recommendation of a friend or 
family member or colleague. So our laser focus on the 
customer experience and ensuring that it is second to 
none is really where we need to play. Technology 
enables that, but it’s never going to replace the 
human touch.”

Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Through member surveys and social media post-
ings, Zipcar collects information about members 
and their lifestyles in order to design the best 
system for a community. Write ten questions 
that you think might elicit useful information 
for Zipcar about students at your own college 
or university.
2. What kind of data would Zipcar’s operational 
support systems likely collect? What kind of 
information might they provide?
3. The ZipcariPhone app already takes care of sev-
eral tasks. If you were a Zipcar member, what 
new task would you add to the app?
4. Do you think your campus would be a 
good candidate for the Zipcar system? Why 
or why not? If your college or university 
already has Zipcar, are you a member? Why 
or why not?

The Dog Ate My Laptop
The night of the tornado, Superintendent of Schools 
Darin Headrick heard the storm sirens go off on his way 
home from work. He stopped at the home of High School 
Principal Randy Fulton and the two men headed for the 
basement, just in case. The next thing they knew, the entire 
school system was gone. Textbooks were scattered every-
where, computers destroyed.
For the first three months after the storm, no one could 
live in town. People stayed in shelters or with friends and 
family outside of town. No one had a home phone anymore, 
but people were eager to connect with each other and find 
out what was happening. Although the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) was distributing information 
at checkpoints on the edges of town, people had to go to 
town to get it.
Like 95 percent of the town’s 1,500 residents, Headrick 
himself was homeless. With just four months to rebuild an 
entire school system, all he had were his laptop and cell phone, 
so he got into his truck and began searching for a wireless sig-
nal. Taking a lesson from his students, he used text messaging 
to distribute information. Although very few people still had 
computers, almost everyone had a cell phone. Residents who 
subscribed to the text service could receive updates and instant 
messages over the phone, wherever they were.
Rebuilding the schools was a bigger task. Headrick 
secured temporary trailers for grades K–12 and received gen-
erous donations of desks and school supplies. By August 15, 
he had the basics needed to start the school year, but he still 
lacked textbooks. Technology would have to fill in the gaps, 
so the students didn’t fall behind.
One of the school system’s existing programs was ITV, 
for Interactive Distance Learning Network. ITV allowed 
Greensburg’s rural schools to log in to classrooms around 
the state via Web cam. This type of real-time distance learn-
ing is referred to as synchronous learning, as opposed to the 
asynchronous online courses given on college campuses. 
After the tornado, all that was needed to get the program 
up and running again were a computer, an Internet connec-
tion, and a Web cam.
Early in the winter each of Greensburg High’s stu-
dents got an unexpected gift: a laptop computer contain-
ing e-books, handwriting recognition software, and a tablet 
screen for note taking. The new laptops replaced their tat-
tered textbooks. Students would hand in their assignments 
via e-mail and receive feedback from their teachers via 
instant messaging.
Questions
After viewing the video, answer the following questions:
1. Was Greensburg Public Schools’ investment in technology 
a smart move?
2. Would you consider enrolling in an asynchronous online 
course? What might be the benefits and drawbacks?
3. Do you think hand-held devices and text messaging 
improve productivity and communication or distract their 
users?

Information Technology 
and Accounting Career
Part 5, “Managing Technology 
and Information,” includes Chapters 
14 and 15, which discuss using com-
puters and related technology to man-
age information and accounting and 
financial statements. In Chapter 14, 
we discussed well-known technology 
companies such as Google and Oracle, 
as well as a host of smaller organiza-
tions that use computer technology 
to manage information. In Chapter 
15, you read about accounting firms 
such as Ernst & Young and a variety 
of public and private organizations, 
large and small, that generate and 
use accounting data. These examples 
illustrate that all organizations need to 
manage technology and information. 
And with the complexity and scope 
of technology and information likely 
to increase in the years ahead, the 
demand for accounting and informa-
tion systems professionals is expected 
to grow.
According to the U.S. 
Department of Labor, employment in 
occupations such as accounting, audit-
ing, computer software engineering 
and support specialists, and network 
systems administrators is expected to 
grow faster than the average for all 
occupations in the next decade. In 
fact, two of the top five occupations 
in which employment is expected to 
grow the fastest over the next few 
years are related to information sys-
tems.1 In addition, recent graduates 
with bachelor’s degrees in account-
ing and information systems have 
among the highest average starting 
salaries of all business graduates. The 
median annual salary for accountants 
and auditors is almost $60,000, with 
the top 10 percent earning about 
$102,000.2 Salaries in information sys-
tems vary widely based on education 
and experience. But starting salaries 
for computer science graduates aver-
age $61,000.3 Those who are infor-
mation systems managers earn about 
$112,000 per year.4
What types of jobs are available 
in information systems and account-
ing? What are the working condi-
tions like? What are the career paths? 
Information systems and accounting 
are both fairly broad occupations and 
encompass a wide variety of jobs. In 
some cases you’ll work in the account-
ing or information systems depart-
ment of a business such as Procter & 
Gamble or Shell. In other cases, you’ll 
work for a specialized accounting or 
information systems firm, such as 
PricewaterhouseCoopers or IBM, 
that provides these services to govern-
ments, not-for-profit organizations, 
and businesses.
Accounting and information 
systems are popular business majors, 
and many entry-level positions are 
available each year. For instance, 
many accounting graduates start 
their careers working for a public 
accounting firm. Initially, their job 
duties involve auditing or tax services, 
usually working with more senior 
accountants. As their careers 
progress, accounting graduates 
take on more and more supervisory 
responsibilities. Some may move 
from public accounting firms to take 
accounting positions at other organi-
zations. Many accounting and infor-
mation systems graduates spend their 
entire careers in these fields, while 
others move into other areas. People 
who began their careers in accounting 
or information systems are well repre-
sented in the ranks of senior manage-
ment today. Let’s look briefly at some 
of the specific jobs you might find 
after earning a degree in accounting 
or information systems.
Public accountants perform a broad 
range of accounting, auditing, tax, and 
consulting services for their clients, 
which include businesses, govern-
ments, not-for-profit organizations, 
and individuals. Auditing is one of the 
most important services offered by 
public accountants, and many account-
ing graduates begin their careers in 
this field. Auditors examine a client’s 
financial statements and account-
ing procedures to make sure they 
conform with all applicable laws and 
regulations. Public accountants either 
own their own businesses or work 
for public accounting firms. Many 
public accountants are certified public

Part 5  Managing Technology and Information
accountants (CPAs). To become a 
CPA, you have to meet educational 
and experience requirements and pass 
a comprehensive examination.
Management accountants work for 
an organization other than a public 
accounting firm. They record and 
analyze financial information and 
financial statements for their organi-
zations. Management accountants are 
also involved in budgeting, tax prepa-
ration, cost management, and asset 
management. Internal auditors verify 
the accuracy of their organization’s 
internal controls and check for irregu-
larities, waste, and fraud.
Technical support specialists are trou-
bleshooters who monitor the perfor-
mance of computer systems; provide 
technical support and solve problems 
for computer users; install, modify, 
clean, and repair computer hardware 
and software; and write training manu-
als and train computer users.
Network administrators design, 
install, and support an organization’s 
computer networks, including 
its local area network, wide area 
network, Internet, and intranet sys-
tems. They provide administrative 
support for software and hardware 
users and ensure that the design of an 
organization’s computer networks and 
all of the components fit together effi-
ciently and effectively.
Computer security specialists plan, 
coordinate, and implement an orga-
nization’s information security. They 
educate users about how to protect 
computer systems, install antivirus and 
similar software, and monitor the net-
works for security breaches. In recent 
years, the role and importance of com-
puter security specialists have increased 
in response to the growing number of 
attacks on networks and data.

Goldman Sachs and Shadow 
Banking
 F ederal law requires banks, investment 
firms, and other financial institutions to publish 
their quarterly financial statements as part 
of their regular accounting practices. Anyone can 
ask to see these statements, but many analysts 
say they are merely window dressing. Not so well 
known to the general public—but an open secret 
on Wall Street—is “shadow banking.” Shadow 
banking involves transactions that occur outside the 
traditional banking system and that therefore escape 
governmental regulation as well as public notice. 
They can lead to accounting problems, however. 
Before the recent recession, shadow banking 
became so pervasive that “nonbank” assets reached 
$10 trillion—about the same amount as all the 
assets of traditional banks. 
One shadow-banking technique is known as 
“netting.” Banks that have similar shares exchange 
those shares without having to record them as 
assets on their financial statements. This is because 
the shares are, theoretically, in neither bank—that 
is, they are in the process of being exchanged. Banks 
can also exchange their shares for cash without 
recording the shares for the same reason. Neither of 
these methods is technically illegal, but because the 
banks keep them off the books, shareholders who 
have invested in those banks almost never learn 
about them.
Many shadow-banking techniques were based on 
exchanges that are more typical of manufacturing or 
service industries. Goods and services, which have 
an intrinsic, agreed-on value, are exchanged all the 
time. But because the value of shares constantly 
changes with the ups and downs of the stock 
market, netting comes with a great deal of risk that 
many analysts feel investors need to know.
Another common shadow-banking technique is the 
repurchase agreement, or “repo.” Using a repo, 
a bank can sell some of its assets and promise 
to buy them back at some future date. This is an 
accounting problem, because it is unclear whether a 
repo should be recorded as a loan or a sale. It also 
affects a bank’s standing with credit rating agencies, 
which basically decide whether the bank is a good 
investment.
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), 
which is investigating the causes of the recent 
financial crisis and recession, was created. The 
commission has begun examining shadow banking 
at various financial institutions, in particular at 
Goldman Sachs.
For many years, Goldman Sachs has been the most 
successful investment firm on Wall Street. Recently, 
Goldman Sachs reported record profits and was 
the first institution to pay back its bailout funds. 
But those profits and what some saw as the bank’s 
ruthless business practices brought criticism. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a 
case accusing Goldman Sachs of securities fraud. 
The SEC accused the bank of creating, selling, 
and—essentially—betting against investment 
packages based on mortgages that the bank 
knew would fail. The collapse of the housing 
market brought the firm billions in profits, but 
the clients who bought those investments lost 
billions. 
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission issued a 
subpoena to Goldman Sachs, requiring it to respond 
under penalty of law. In response to the FCIC’s 
requests for information, the bank responded by 
submitting the equivalent of billions of pages of data 
and delayed answering questions about its banking 
practices.1

Accounting professionals prepare the 
financial information that organizations pres-
ent in their annual reports. Whether you begin 
your career by working for a company or by 
starting your own firm, you need to under-
stand what accountants do and why their work 
is so important in contemporary business.
Accounting is the process of measuring, 
interpreting, and communicating financial 
information to enable people inside and 
outside the firm to make informed decisions. 
In many ways, accounting is the language of 
business. Accountants gather, record, report, 
and interpret financial information in a way 
that describes the status and operation of an 
organization and aids in decision making.
Millions of men and women through-
out the world describe their occupation as 
accountant. In the United States alone more 
than 1.3 million people work as accountants. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
the number of accounting-related jobs is 
expected to increase by around 22 percent 
between now and 2018, a much faster rate of 
growth than the average for all occupations.2 
The availability of jobs and relatively 
high starting salaries for talented graduates—
starting salaries for accounting graduates 
average just under $50,000 per year—have 
made accounting one of the most in-demand 
majors on college campuses. After the recent 
financial downturn, hiring levels fell, but the 
most recent report estimates that firms will 
hire 5.3 percent more accounting graduates 
this year over last year.3
This chapter begins by describing who 
uses accounting information. It discusses busi-
ness activities involving accounting statements: 
financing, investing, and operations. It explains 
the accounting process, defines double-entry 
bookkeeping, and presents the accounting 
equation. We then discuss the development 
of financial statements from information 
about financial transactions. The methods of 
interpreting these statements and the roles of 
budgeting in planning and controlling a busi-
ness are described next. The chapter concludes 
with a discussion of the development and 
implementation schedule of a uniform set of 
accounting rules for global business.

Overview
15
Users of Accounting Information
People both inside and outside an organization rely on accounting information to help 
them make business decisions. Figure 15.1 lists the users of accounting information and the 
applications they find for that information.
Managers with a business, government agency, or not-for-profit organization are the 
major users of accounting information, because it helps them plan and control daily and 
long-range operations. Business owners and boards of directors of not-for-profit groups also 
rely on accounting data to determine how well managers are operating the organizations. 
Union officials use accounting data in contract negotiations, and employees refer to it as 
they monitor their firms’ productivity and profitability performance.
To help employees understand how their work affects the bottom line, many 
companies share sensitive financial information with their employees and teach them how to 
understand and use financial statements. Proponents of what is often referred to as open book

management believe that allowing employees to view 
financial information helps them better understand 
how their work contributes to the company’s success, 
which, in turn, benefits them.
Outside a firm, potential investors evaluate 
accounting information to help them decide whether 
to buy a firm’s stock. As we’ll discuss in more detail 
later in the chapter, any company whose stock is 
traded publicly is required to report its financial results 
on a regular basis. So anyone, for example, can find 
out what Home Depot’s sales were last year or how 
much money Research in Motion made during the 
last quarter. Bankers and other lenders use accounting 
information to evaluate a potential borrower’s finan-
cial soundness. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
and state tax officials use it to determine a company’s 
tax liability. Citizens’ groups and government agen-
cies use such information in assessing the efficiency of 
operations such as Massachusetts General Hospital; 
the Topeka, Kansas, school system; Community 
College of Denver; and the Art Institute of Chicago.
Accountants play fundamental roles not only in 
business but also in other aspects of society. Their 
work influences each of the business environments 
discussed earlier in this book. They clearly contribute 
important information to help managers deal with the 
competitive and economic environments.
Less obvious contributions help others understand, 
predict, and react to the technological, regulatory, and 
social and cultural environments. For instance, thou-
sands of people volunteer each year to help people with 
their taxes. One of the largest organized programs is 
Tax-Aide, sponsored by AARP (formally known as the 
American Association of Retired Persons). Its program 
has in excess of 34,000 IRS-trained volunteers helping 
low- and middle-income persons over 60 file their state 
and federal tax returns. More than 2.6 million clients 
used the free service in one recent year.4
Business Activities Involving Accounting
The natural progression of a business begins with financing. Subsequent steps, including 
investing, lead to operating the business. All organizations, profit oriented and not-
for-profit, perform these three basic activities, and accounting plays a key role in each one:
1. Financing activities provide necessary funds to start a business and expand it after it begins 
operating.
2. Investing activities provide valuable assets required to run a business.
3. Operating activities focus on selling goods and services, but they also consider expenses as 
important elements of sound financial management.

Ken Solinsky, the president of New Hampshire-based Insight Technology Inc., per-
formed all three activities during the start-up and growth of his specialized-imaging com-
pany. The accounting firm Ernst & Young recently named him Entrepreneur of the Year in 
Distribution and Manufacturing. Solinsky’s company provides such products as night-vision 
devices and laser range-finding systems for the U.S. military, federal law enforcement, and 
allied nations. A year after Solinsky and his wife founded Insight, they responded to a bid 
request from the U.S. government for infrared equipment. Solinsky took out a second mort-
gage on his house and maxed out his credit cards to pay production costs. His presentation, 
conducted in rented office space, won Insight the contract, and the company has gradu-
ally expanded its range of products. To ensure the availability of supply sources that meet 
Solinsky’s high standards, the company has purchased and formed several companies that 
manufacture the precision optical equipment its products require.5
Accounting Professionals
Accounting professionals work in a variety of areas in and for business firms, 
government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations. They can be classified as public, 
management, government, and not-for-profit accountants.
Public Accountants
A public accountant provides accounting services to individuals or business firms for 
a fee. Most public accounting firms provide three basic services to clients: (1) auditing, or 
examining, financial records; (2) tax preparation, planning, and related services; and (3) man-
agement consulting. Because public accountants are not employees of a client firm, they can 
provide unbiased advice about the firm’s financial condition.
While there are hundreds of public accounting firms in the United States, a handful of 
firms dominate the industry. The four largest public accounting firms—Deloitte & Touche, 
Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)—collect almost $32 billion 
annually from U.S. clients alone.  In contrast, the Minneapolis-based RSM McGladrey, the 
nation’s fifth-largest accounting firm, has annual revenues of approximately $1.5 billion.6
Some years ago, public accounting firms came under sharp criticism for providing 
management consulting services to many of the same firms they audited. Critics argued 
that when a public accounting firm does both—auditing and management consulting—an 
inherent conflict of interest is created. In addition, this conflict of interest may undermine 
confidence in the quality of the financial statements accounting firms audit. The bankrupt-
cies of some high-profile firms increased pressure on public accounting firms to end the 
practice. Legislation also established strict limits on the types of consulting services auditors 
can provide. For example, an accounting firm that audits a company’s books cannot provide 
any other services to that company, including tax services. As a result, three of the four larg-
est public accounting firms either sold large portions of their consulting practices or spun 
them off into separate companies, and they now concentrate on providing auditing and tax 
services. PwC, for instance, sold much of its consulting business to IBM.
As the “Hit & Miss” feature outlines, a growing number of public accountants are also 
certified as forensic accountants, and some smaller public accounting firms actually specialize in 
forensic accounting. These professionals, and the firms that employ them, focus on uncover-
ing potential fraud in a variety of organizations.

When most people think of accountants, the image that prob-
ably comes to mind is that of someone poring over stacks of ledgers 
or computer printouts, calculator in hand. Although a good deal of 
accounting does involve ledgers and printouts, forensic accountants 
don’t simply accept a company’s numbers at face value—they are 
crime fighters. People who work in this growing field investigate such 
white-collar crimes as business fraud, improper financial reporting, and 
illegal investment schemes.
Forensic accounting is accounting performed in preparation for 
legal review. Forensic accountants take the skeptical view, investigating 
below the surface of an organization’s accounting system to find out 
what actually happened. They may also testify as expert witnesses if a 
case goes to trial. The job requires a bachelor’s degree in accounting 
and CPA certification, with further training in investigative techniques 
for certification as a certified fraud examiner (CFE) or a certified foren-
sic accountant (CrFA). 
When the energy giant Enron Corporation collapsed, forensic 
accounting investigations revealed that for several years, company 
executives had issued false financial statements that exaggerated the 
company’s earnings and thereby increased the firm’s stock prices. 
The statements painted a rosy picture of steady profits that met earn-
ings expectations. In reality, Enron’s own investments were doing badly, 
and its profits were nonexistent. The company was actually losing 
money. Even after the truth began to leak out and the company’s stock 
prices fell, the executives continued to issue false financial statements 
in the hope of slowing the fall. In a federal trial, two former executives 
were convicted of conspiracy, wire fraud, and securities fraud.
Tracy Coenen, a forensic accountant and the head of Milwaukee-
based Sequence Inc., says, “Some people say I have a nose for 
fraud. . . . The more complicated the puzzle, the better I like it.”

Forensic Accountants: Fraud Busters
Hit 
Certified public accountants (CPAs) demonstrate their accounting knowledge by meeting 
state requirements for education and experience and successfully completing a number of rig-
orous tests in accounting theory and practice, auditing, law, and taxes. Other accountants who 
meet specified educational and experience requirements and pass certification exams carry the 
title certified management accountant, certified fraud examiner, or certified internal auditor.
Management Accountants
An accountant employed by a business other than a public accounting firm is called a 
management accountant. Such a person collects and records financial transactions and prepares 
financial statements used by the firm’s managers in decision making. Management accountants 
provide timely, relevant, accurate, and concise information that executives can use to operate 
their firms more effectively and more profitably than they could without this input. In addition 
to preparing financial statements, a management accountant plays a major role in interpreting 
them. A management accountant should provide answers to many important questions:
 • Where is the company going?
 • What opportunities await it?
 • Do certain situations expose the company to excessive risk?
 • Does the firm’s information system provide detailed and timely information to all levels 
of management?
Management accountants frequently specialize in different aspects of accounting. A cost 
accountant, for example, determines the cost of goods and services and helps set their prices.

An internal auditor examines the firm’s financial practices to ensure that its records include 
accurate data and that its operations comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations. 
A tax accountant works to minimize a firm’s tax bill and assumes responsibility for its federal, 
state, county, and city tax returns. Some management accountants achieve a certified management 
accountant (CMA) designation through experience and passing a comprehensive examination.
Management accountants are usually involved in the development and enforcement of 
organizational policies on such items as employee travel. As part of their job, many employ-
ees travel and accumulate airline frequent flyer miles and hotel reward points. While some 
organizations have strict policies over the personal use of travel perks, many do not.
Changing federal regulations affecting accounting and public reporting have increased 
the demand for management accountants in recent years. As a result, salaries for these pro-
fessionals are rising.
Government and Not-for-Profit Accountants
Federal, state, and local governments also require accounting services. Government 
accountants and those who work for not-for-profit organizations perform professional 
services similar to those of management accountants. Accountants in these sectors concern 
themselves primarily with determining how efficiently the organizations accomplish their 
objectives. Among the many government agencies that employ accountants are the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal 
Revenue Service, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the City of Fresno, California. 
The federal government alone employs thousands of accountants.
Not-for-profit organizations, such as churches, labor unions, charities, schools, hospitals, 
and universities, also hire accountants. In fact, the not-for-profit sector is one of the fastest 
growing segments of accounting practice. An increasing number of not-for-profits publish 
financial information because contributors want more accountability from these organiza-
tions and are interested in knowing how the groups spend the money that they raise.
The Foundation of the 
Accounting System
To provide reliable, consistent, and unbiased information to decision makers, accoun-
tants follow guidelines, or standards, known as generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP). These principles encompass the conventions, rules, and procedures for determining 
acceptable accounting and financial reporting practices at a particular time.
All GAAP standards are based on four basic principles: consistency, relevance, reliability, 
and comparability. Consistency means that all data should be collected and presented in the 
same manner across all periods. Any change in the way in which specific data are collected or 
presented must be noted and explained. Relevance states that all information being reported 
should be appropriate and assist users in evaluating that information. Reliability implies that 
the accounting data presented in financial statements are reliable and can be verified by an 
independent party such as an outside auditor. Finally, comparability ensures that one firm’s 
financial statements can be compared with those of similar businesses. In the United States, 
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is primarily responsible for evaluating, 
setting, or modifying GAAP. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the 
chief federal regulator of the financial markets and accounting industry, actually has the

statutory authority to establish financial account-
ing and reporting standards for publicly held 
companies. (A publicly held company is one whose 
stock is publicly traded in a market such as the 
New York Stock Exchange.) However, the SEC’s 
policy has been to rely on the accounting indus-
try for this function, as long as the SEC believes 
the private sector is operating in the public inter-
est. Consequently, the Financial Accounting 
Foundation—an organization made up of members 
of many different professional groups—actually 
appoints the members (currently five) of FASB, 
although the SEC does have some input. Board 
members are all experienced accounting profes-
sionals and serve five-year terms. They may be 
reappointed for a second five-year term. Board 
members must sever all connections with the 
firms they served prior to joining the board. 
The board is supported by a professional staff of 
more than 60 individuals.7
The FASB carefully monitors changing busi-
ness conditions, enacting new rules and modifying 
existing rules when necessary. It also considers 
input and requests from all segments of its diverse 
constituency, including corporations and the SEC. 
One major change in accounting rules recently 
dealt with executive and employee stock options. 
Stock options give the holder the right to buy 
stock at a fixed price. The FASB now requires 
firms that give employees stock options to calcu-
late the cost of the options and treat the cost as an 
expense, similar to salaries.
In response to well-known cases of account-
ing fraud, and questions about the independence 
of auditors, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act—commonly 
known as SOX—created the Public Accounting 
Oversight Board. The five-member board has the 
power to set audit standards and to investigate and 
sanction accounting firms that certify the books 
of publicly traded firms. Members of the Public 
Accounting Oversight Board are appointed by the 
SEC. No more than two of the five members of 
the board can be certified public accountants.
In addition to creating the Public Accounting 
Oversight Board, SOX also added to the reporting 
requirements for publicly traded companies. Senior 
executives including the CEO and chief finan-
cial officer (CFO), for example, must personally 
certify that the financial information reported by

Tips for Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Compliance
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is intended to prevent the bribery of foreign 
ofﬁ cials for the purpose of gaining or keeping business in another country. 
As more companies do business overseas, they are naturally concerned 
about becoming vulnerable to violations of this law. Federal enforcement 
of this act is at an all-time high and is expected to remain so. Penalties are 
severe and can include ﬁ nes and imprisonment for anyone convicted. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice also 
expect strict compliance. The following are some ways that global ﬁ rms can 
improve their compliance and mitigate risk:
1 
Assess your ﬁ rm’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act risk country by country. 
Does your ﬁ rm do business with any state-owned foreign ﬁ rms or foreign 
government ofﬁ cials? What risk is there of corruption and bribery?
2 Establish a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance policy for your ﬁ rm’s 
employees in the United States and abroad. The policy should cover gifts 
and payments to foreign ofﬁ cials, charitable donations, accurate and 
complete records, and other areas vulnerable to risk. 
3 
Train your employees in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act policy, and 
integrate it into your company’s overall compliance. Have your HR depart-
ment make it part of new-employee orientation.
4 
Have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance team in place to monitor 
compliance and signal potential risks. The team should include company 
lawyers, accountants, and auditors and should be able to make both in-
house and external investigations.
5 
Plan any international investigations carefully. Many foreign countries 
do not recognize the attorney–client privilege as applying to company 
lawyers and employees.

The Accounting Cycle
the company is correct. As we noted earlier, these requirements have increased the demand 
for accounting professionals, especially managerial accountants. One result of this increased 
demand has been higher salaries.
It is expensive for firms to adhere to GAAP standards and SOX requirements. Audits, 
for instance, can cost millions of dollars each year. These expenses can be especially burden-
some for small businesses. Consequently, some have proposed modifications to GAAP and 
SOX for smaller firms, arguing that some accounting rules were really designed for larger 
companies. Others disagree. 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is a federal law that prohibits U.S. citizens and 
companies from bribing foreign officials in order to win or continue business. The law 
was later extended to make foreign officials subject to penalties if they in any way cause 
similar corrupt practices to occur within the United States or its territories. The “Business 
Etiquette” feature provides some tips on Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance.
The Accounting Cycle
Accounting deals with financial transactions between a firm and its employees, custom-
ers, suppliers, and owners; bankers; and various government agencies. For example, payroll 
checks result in a cash outflow to compensate employees. A payment to a vendor results in 
receipt of needed materials for the production process. Cash, check, and credit purchases 
by customers generate funds to cover the costs of operations and to earn a profit. Prompt 
payment of bills preserves the firm’s credit rating and its future ability to earn a profit. The 
procedure by which accountants convert data about individual transactions to financial state-
ments is called the accounting cycle.
Figure 15.2 illustrates the activities involved in the accounting cycle: recording, classify-
ing, and summarizing transactions. Initially, any transaction that has a financial impact on the 
business, such as wages or payments to suppliers, should be documented. All of these transac-

tions are recorded in journals, which list transactions in chronological order. Journal listings 
are then posted to ledgers. A ledger shows increases or decreases in specific accounts such as 
cash or wages. Ledgers are used to prepare the financial statements, which summarize 
financial transactions. Management and other interested parties use the resulting financial 
statements for a variety of purposes.
The Accounting Equation
Three fundamental terms appear in the accounting equation: assets, liabilities, and own-
ers’ equity. An asset is anything of value owned or leased by a business. Assets include land, 
buildings, supplies, cash, accounts receivable (amounts owed to the business as payment for 
credit sales), and marketable securities.
Although most assets are tangible assets, such as equipment, buildings, and inventories, 
intangible possessions such as patents and trademarks are often some of a firm’s most 
important assets. This kind of asset is especially essential for many companies, including 
computer software firms, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical companies. For 
instance, Johnson & Johnson—which has both biotechnology and pharmaceutical 
operations—reported more than $31 billion in intangible assets (including goodwill) in one 
recent year, out of a total of almost $95 billion in assets.8
Two groups have claims against the assets of a firm: creditors and owners. A liability 
of a business is anything owed to creditors—that is, the claims of a firm’s creditors. When a 
firm borrows money to purchase inventory, land, or machinery, the claims of creditors are 
shown as accounts payable, notes payable, or long-term debt. Wages and salaries owed to 
employees also are liabilities (known as wages payable or accrued wages).
Owners’ equity is the owner’s initial investment in the business plus profits that were 
not paid out to owners over time in the form of cash dividends. A strong owners’ equity 
position often is used as evidence of a firm’s financial strength and stability.

The accounting equation (also referred to as the accounting identity) states that assets 
must equal liabilities plus owners’ equity. This equation reflects the financial position of a 
firm at any point in time:
Assets  Liabilities  Owners’ equity
Because financing comes from either creditors or owners, the right side of the account-
ing equation also represents the business’s financial structure.
The accounting equation also illustrates double-entry bookkeeping—the process 
by which accounting transactions are recorded. Because assets must always equal liabilities 
plus equity, each transaction must have an offsetting transaction. For example, if a company 
increases an asset, either another asset must decrease, a liability must increase, or owners’ 
equity must increase. So if a company uses cash to purchase inventory, one asset (inventory) 
is increased while another (cash) is decreased by the same amount. Similarly, a decrease in 
an asset must be offset by either an increase in another asset, a decrease in a liability, or a 
decrease in owners’ equity. If a company uses cash to repay a bank loan, both an asset (cash) 
and a liability (bank loans) decrease, and by the same amount.
Two simple numerical examples will help illustrate the accounting equation and double-
entry bookkeeping. First, assume the owner of a photo studio purchases a new camera sys-
tem for $5,000 using her personal funds. The accounting transaction would look as follows:
Increase plant, property, and equipment (an asset) by $5,000
Increase owners’ equity by $5,000
So, the left side of the accounting equation would increase by $5,000 and be offset by a 
$5,000 increase on the right side.
Second, assume a firm has a $100,000 loan from a bank and decides to pay it off using 
some of its cash. The transaction would be recorded as:
Decrease bank loan (liability) by $100,000
Decrease cash (asset) by $100,000
In this second example, the left side and right side of the accounting equation would 
both decrease by $100,000.
The relationship expressed by the accounting equation underlies development of the 
firm’s financial statements. Three financial statements form the foundation: the balance 
sheet, the income statement, and the statement of owners’ equity. The information found 
in these statements is calculated using the double-entry bookkeeping system and reflects the 
basic accounting equation. A fourth statement, the statement of cash flows, is also prepared 
to focus specifically on the sources and uses of cash for a firm from its operating, investing, 
and financing activities.
The Impact of Computers and the Internet 
on the Accounting Process
For hundreds of years, bookkeepers recorded, or posted, accounting transactions as 
manual entries in journals. They then transferred the information, or posted it, to individual 
accounts listed in ledgers. Computers have streamlined the process, making it both faster 
and easier. For instance, point-of-sale terminals in retail stores perform a number of

Deloitte Educates Itself—and Others—on Sustainability
For many years, Deloitte has been one of the Big Four accounting 
and auditing firms. Recently the company decided not only to make 
its own internal operations greener but also to offer its clients training 
in green practices. It does seem logical for a firm that specializes in 
financial reporting to enter the realm of nonfinancial reporting as the 
business world changes course on green practices. Whereas firms once 
considered “going green” good public relations but financially unre-
warding, many now see the importance of sustainability in an increas-
ingly energy-limited environment. 
Kathryn Pavlovsky, a co-leader of Deloitte’s Enterprise 
Sustainability Group, says, “Nonfinancial reporting is evolving from 
voluntary communications to mandatory compliance, and the envi-
ronmental regulatory and financial reporting worlds are converging.” 
Activism by shareholders and changing consumer attitudes and behav-
ior have also been heavily influential, as has the recent recession. 
Technological advances are making green practices increasingly 
feasible and affordable.
Deloitte’s corporate responsibility policy declares that their U.S. 
firms will “advocate the sustainable use of natural resources and the 
environment.” The company began its internal greening campaign by 
conducting a survey of its employees. Called “How green is your foot-
print?” the survey measured “greenness” on an individual basis, then 
made suggestions on how each employee could improve his or her per-
formance. A second survey, “How green is your other footprint?” helps 
employees measure sustainability in their homes.
Deloitte also established a Green Leadership Council to maintain 
contact between the various company regions and management. The 
GLC educates employees about important green issues and promotes a 
unified message to all the company’s offices. Deloitte employees now 
conduct virtual meetings and conferences whenever possible; when 
not, company travel offers green car-rental and hotel options. Deloitte 
has also adopted Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED) standards in building new offices and retrofitting existing ones. 
The company has focused on purchasing supplies that have a minimal 
impact on the environment, and worked with its suppliers for greater 
sustainability.
Deloitte’s Center for Sustainability Performance (CSP) in Waltham, 
Massachusetts, is geared toward advising businesses on how to reduce 
their environmental impact and remain profitable. Among the areas 
covered are planning and strategy, revenue generation, tax incentives, 
and competitive branding. The CSP also explores sustainability opportu-
nities for employees, offices, IT infrastructure, and communities. Among 
the center’s activities are on-site training for client firms; research and 
development in sustainability measurement and reporting, publication 
of reports on these topics for corporate sustainability managers, and 
consulting and sales support.
One of the center’s recent workshops for clients was 
“Sustainability Measurement and Reporting: Tools, Methods, and 
Metrics.” The course was designed to help clients become acquainted 
with the current methods for measuring and reporting their own sus-
tainability, as well as giving them a preview of new developments in 
these areas. According to Mark W. McElroy, the CSP’s director, the 
course covered “tools, methods and metrics across all dimensions of 
corporate social responsibility and sustainability performance, including 
carbon, water, solid waste, social impacts, triple bottom line and non-
financial measurement and reporting in general, both from an enter-
prise and product life cycle perspective.” 
In further developing its internal greening efforts, Deloitte recently 
introduced its Green Sync tool, which is intended to promote employee 
and stakeholder involvement. Thomas Dekar, the vice chairman of 
Deloitte LLP, says of Green Sync, “Because people are the most impor-
tant asset of any organization, companies can benefit through increased 
recognition as an employer of choice—one that recruits and retains the 
best, most diverse talent, and has a collaborative culture that engages 
employees in achieving sustainability.”
Questions for Critical Thinking

expand from financial to nonfinancial reporting?
2. How would you go about answering the question, “How 
big is your carbon footprint?” What did you find that you 
could do to make your home and/or your workplace 
greener?

Accounting software programs are used widely in both large and small businesses today. 
They allow a do-it-once approach, in which a single input leads to automatic conversion of a 
sale into a journal entry, which then is stored until needed. Decision makers can then request 
up-to-date financial statements and financial ratios instantly. Improvements in accounting

software continue to make the process even faster and easier. ABC Bus Companies Inc.—
headquartered in Minnesota—sells, leases, customizes, and services motor coaches for 
companies and individuals. The company used a Sage Software product called SalesLogix 
Configuration Engine to replace its inefficient paper-based system and generate complex 
product bids for the hundreds of customizing options available. Jim Morrison, ABC’s vice 
president of sales, immediately saw the advantage of using a computer-based system. “The 
quotes could be tied to the opportunities we already tracked in Sage SalesLogix. . . . That 
means we know what’s happening with the customer all the way through the entire process.”9
Because the accounting needs of entrepreneurs and small businesses differ from those 
of larger firms, accounting software makers have designed programs that meet specific 
user needs. Some examples of accounting software programs designed for entrepreneurs 
and small businesses, and designed to run on personal computers, include QuickBooks, 
Peachtree, and BusinessWorks. Software programs designed for larger firms, often requiring 
more sophisticated computer systems, include products from Oracle and SAP.
For firms that conduct business worldwide, software producers have introduced new 
accounting programs that handle all of a company’s accounting information for every coun-
try in which it operates. The software handles different languages and currencies, as well as 
the financial, legal, and tax requirements of each nation in which the firm conducts business.
The Internet also influences the accounting process. Several software producers offer 
Web-based accounting products designed for small and medium-sized businesses. Among 
other benefits, these products allow users to access their complete accounting systems from 
anywhere using a standard Web browser. The “Going Green” feature explains how Deloitte 
is integrating sustainability into its infrastructure and its business services.
Financial Statements
Financial statements provide managers with essential information they need to evaluate 
the liquidity position of an organization—its ability to meet current obligations and needs by 
converting assets into cash; the firm’s profitability; and its overall financial health. The bal-
ance sheet, income statement, statement of owners’ 
equity, and statement of cash flows provide a founda-
tion on which managers can base their decisions. By 
interpreting the data provided in these statements, 
managers can communicate the appropriate informa-
tion to internal decision makers and to interested 
parties outside the organization.
Of the four financial statements, only the bal-
ance sheet is considered to be a permanent statement; 
its amounts are carried over from year to year. The 
income statement, statement of owners’ equity, and 
statement of cash flows are considered temporary 
because they are closed out at the end of each year.
Public companies are required to report their 
financial statements at the end of each three-month 
period, as well as at the end of each fiscal year. 
Annual statements must be examined and verified by 
the firm’s outside auditors. These financial statements

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) was intended to reduce 
fraud, partly by requiring CEOs and CFOs to sign off on the accuracy of 
their companies’ financial statements. However, the largest percentage 
of reported fraud is revealed by anonymous whistle-blowers or by jour-
nalists, auditors, or others.
The U.S. False Claims Act allows citizens to file lawsuits alleging 
fraud against the federal government. The biggest settlements have 
involved hospital chains and drug manufacturers; the largest fine was 
$1 billion. Some whistle-blowers have collected almost $47 million in 
rewards. Provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) can 
also potentially result in huge rewards. But whistle-blowers are not 
always successful; some have been fired, forced to quit, or demoted.
Should whistle-blowers be rewarded for reporting 
fi nancial fraud?
Summary
Legislation before Congress would require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to award 
whistle-blowers up to 30 percent of fines the government collects on the basis of “original information.” 
Some observers worry that these changes could result in a “race to disclose” between companies that self-
report and current or former employees. Currently, more than 1,000 whistle-blower cases are pending.

1. A recent survey found that “a strong monetary incentive to 
blow the whistle does motivate people with information to come 
forward.”
2. Despite strict penalties for fraud, such as those under SOX 
and the FCPA, one survey reported that 83 percent of fraud examiners 
believe that internal corporate controls over fraud will actually 
decline.

with the federal government and paying a fine to avoid costly legal 
procedures.

are public information available to anyone. The “Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature 
discusses the problem of financial fraud.
A fiscal year does not have to coincide with the calendar year, and companies set differ-
ent fiscal years. For instance, Starbucks’s fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30 of 
the following year. Nike’s fiscal year consists of the 12 months between June 1 and May 31. 
By contrast, GE’s fiscal year is the same as the calendar year, running from January 1 to 
December 31.
The Balance Sheet
A firm’s balance sheet shows its financial position on a particular date. It is similar to 
a photograph of the firm’s assets together with its liabilities and owners’ equity at a specific 
moment in time. Balance sheets must be prepared at regular intervals, because a firm’s

tion—what it owns and 
claims against its assets—
at a particular point in 
time.

Part 6  Managing Financial Resources
512
managers and other internal parties often request this information every day, every week, 
or at least every month. On the other hand, external users, such as stockholders or industry 
analysts, may use this information less frequently, perhaps every quarter or once a year.
The balance sheet follows the accounting equation. On the left side of the balance sheet 
are the firm’s assets—what it owns. These assets, shown in descending order of liquidity (in 
other words, convertibility to cash), represent the uses that management has made of avail-
able funds. Cash is always listed first on the asset side of the balance sheet.
On the right side of the equation are the claims against the firm’s assets. Liabilities and 
owners’ equity indicate the sources of the firm’s assets and are listed in the order in which 
they are due. Liabilities reflect the claims of creditors—financial institutions or bondhold-
ers that have loaned the firm money; suppliers that have provided goods and services on 
credit; and others to be paid, such as federal, state, and local tax authorities. Owners’ equity 
represents the owners’ claims (those of stockholders, in the case of a corporation) against the 
firm’s assets. It also amounts to the excess of all assets over liabilities.
Figure 15.3 shows the balance sheet for Diane’s Java, a small California-based cof-
fee wholesaler. The accounting equation is illustrated by the three classifications of assets, 
liabilities, and owners’ equity on the company’s balance sheet. Remember, total assets must 
always equal the sum of liabilities and owners’ equity. In other words, the balance sheet 
must always balance.
The Income Statement
Whereas the balance sheet reflects a firm’s financial situation at a specific point in time, 
the income statement represents the flow of resources that reveals the performance of the 
organization over a specific time period. Resembling a video rather than a photograph, the 
income statement is a financial record summarizing a firm’s financial performance in terms 
of revenues, expenses, and profits over a given time period, say, a quarter or a year.
In addition to reporting the firm’s profit or loss results, the income statement helps 
decision makers focus on overall revenues and the costs involved in generating these rev-
enues. Managers of a not-for-profit organization use this statement to determine whether 
its revenues from contributions and other sources will cover its operating costs. Finally, the 
income statement provides much of the basic data needed to calculate the financial ratios 
managers use in planning and controlling activities. Figure 15.4 shows the income statement 
for Diane’s Java.
An income statement (some times called a profit-and-loss, or P&L, statement) begins with 
total sales or revenues generated during a year, quarter, or month. Subsequent lines then 
deduct all of the costs related to producing the revenues. Typical categories of costs include 
those involved in producing the firm’s goods or services, operating expenses, interest, and 
taxes. After all of them have been subtracted, the remaining net income may be distributed 
to the firm’s owners (stockholders, proprietors, or partners) or reinvested in the company as 
retained earnings. The final figure on the income statement—net income after taxes—is the 
so-called bottom line.
Keeping costs under control is an important part of running a business. Too often, 
however, companies concentrate more on increasing revenue than on controlling costs. 
Regardless of how much money a company collects in revenues, it won’t stay in business for 
long unless it eventually earns a profit.

Statement of Owners’ Equity
The statement of owners’, or shareholders’, equity is designed to show the com-
ponents of the change in equity from the end of one fiscal year to the end of the next. It 
uses information from both the balance sheet and income statement. A somewhat simplified 
example is shown in Figure 15.5 for Diane’s Java.
Note that the statement begins with the amount of equity shown on the balance sheet at 
the end of the prior year. Net income is added, and cash dividends paid to owners are sub-
tracted (both are found on the income statement for the current year). If owners contributed 
any additional capital, say, through the sale of new shares, this amount is added to equity. On 
the other hand, if owners withdrew capital, for example, through the repurchase of existing 
shares, equity declines. All of the additions and subtractions, taken together, equal the change 
in owners’ equity from the end of the last fiscal year to the end of the current one. The new 
amount of owners’ equity is then reported on the balance sheet for the current year.

Chapter 15  Understanding Accounting and Financial Statements
515
The Statement of Cash Flows
In addition to the statement of owners’ equity, the income statement, and the balance 
sheet, most firms prepare a fourth accounting statement—the statement of cash flows. 
Public companies are required to prepare and publish a statement of cash flows. In addition, 
commercial lenders often require a borrower to submit a statement of cash flows. The state-
ment of cash flows provides investors and creditors with relevant information about a firm’s 
cash receipts and cash payments for its operations, investments, and financing during an 
accounting period. Figure 15.6 shows the statement of cash flows for Diane’s Java.
Companies prepare a statement of cash flows due to the widespread use of accrual 
accounting. Accrual accounting recognizes revenues and costs when they occur, not when 
actual cash changes hands. As a result, there can be differences between what is reported as 
sales, expenses, and profits, and the amount of cash that actually flows into and out of the 
business during a period of time. An example is depreciation. Companies depreciate fixed 
assets—such as machinery and buildings—over a specified period of time, meaning that they 
systematically reduce the value of the asset. Depreciation is reported as an expense on the 
firm’s income statement—see Figure 15.4—but does not involve any actual cash. The fact 
that depreciation is a noncash expense means that what a firm reports as net income (profits 
after tax) for a particular period actually understates the amount of cash the firm took in, 
less expenses, during that period of time. Consequently, depreciation is added back to net 
income when calculating cash flow.
The fact that cash flow is the lifeblood of every organization is evidenced by the business 
failure rate. Many former owners of failed firms blame inadequate cash flow for their company’s 
demise. Those who value the statement of cash flow maintain that its preparation and scrutiny

by various parties can prevent financial distress for otherwise profitable firms, too many of which 
are forced into bankruptcy due to a lack of cash needed to continue day-to-day operations.
Even for firms for which bankruptcy is not an issue, the statement of cash flows can pro-
vide investors and other interested parties with vital information. For instance, assume that a 
firm’s income statement reports rising earnings. At the same time, however, the statement of 
cash flows shows that the firm’s inventory is rising faster than sales—often a signal that demand 
for the firm’s products is softening, which may in turn be a sign of impending financial trouble.
Financial Ratio Analysis
Accounting professionals fulfill important responsibilities beyond preparing financial 
statements. In a more critical role, they help managers interpret the statements by compar-
ing data about the firm’s current activities to those for previous periods and to results posted 
by other companies in the industry. Ratio analysis is one of the most commonly used tools for 
measuring a firm’s liquidity, profitability, and reliance on debt financing, as well as the effec-
tiveness of management’s resource utilization. This analysis also allows comparisons with 
other firms and with the firm’s own past performance.
Ratios assist managers by interpreting actual performance and making comparisons to 
what should have happened. Comparisons with ratios of similar companies help managers 
understand their firm’s performance relative to competitors’ results. These industry stan-
dards are important yardsticks and help pinpoint problem areas, as well as areas of excellence. 
Ratios for the current accounting period also may be compared with similar calculations for 
previous periods to spot developing trends. Ratios can be classified according to their specific 
purposes. The four major categories of financial ratios are summarized in Table 15.1. The 
ratios for Diane’s Java for the 2011 and 2012 fiscal years are shown in Table 15.2.

Liquidity Ratios
A firm’s ability to meet its short-term obligations when they must be paid is measured 
by liquidity ratios. Increasing liquidity reduces the likelihood that a firm will face emergencies 
caused by the need to raise funds to repay loans. On the other hand, firms with low liquid-
ity may be forced to choose between default or borrowing from high-cost lending sources to 
meet their maturing obligations.
Two commonly used liquidity ratios are the current ratio and the acid-test, or quick, 
ratio. The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities, giving executives infor-
mation about the firm’s ability to pay its current debts as they mature. The current ratio

sheet or income statement are in thousands of dollars):

In other words, Diane’s Java has $2.58 of current assets for every $1.00 of current liabili-
ties. In general, a current ratio of 2:1 is considered satisfactory liquidity. This rule of thumb 
must be considered along with other factors, such as the nature of the business, the season, 
and the quality of the company’s management team. Diane’s Java’s management and other 
interested parties are likely to evaluate this ratio of 2.58:1 by comparing it with ratios for 
previous operating periods and with industry averages.
The acid-test (or quick) ratio measures the ability of a firm to meet its debt payments on 
short notice. This ratio compares quick assets—the most liquid current assets—against current

liabilities. Quick assets generally consist of cash and equivalents, short-term investments, and 
accounts receivable. So, generally quick assets equal total current assets minus inventory.
Diane’s Java’s current balance sheet lists total current assets of $5.24 million and inven-
tory of $2.2 million. Therefore, its quick ratio is as follows:

Because the traditional rule of thumb for an adequate acid-test ratio is around 1:1, 
Diane’s Java appears to have a strong level of liquidity. However, the same cautions apply 
here as for the current ratio. The ratio should be compared with industry averages and data 
from previous operating periods to determine whether it is adequate for the firm.
Activity Ratios
Activity ratios measure the effectiveness of management’s use of the firm’s resources. One 
of the most frequently used activity ratios, the inventory turnover ratio, indicates the number 
of times merchandise moves through a business:

Average inventory for Diane’s Java is determined by adding the inventory as of December 
31, 2012 ($2.2 million) with the inventory as of December 31, 2011 ($1.85 million) and divid-
ing it by 2. Comparing the 5.13 inventory turnover ratio with industry standards gives a 
measure of efficiency. It is important to note, however, that inventory turnover can vary sub-
stantially depending on the products a company sells and the industry in which it operates. 
If a company makes a substantial portion of its sales on credit, measuring receivables 
turnover can provide useful information. Receivables turnover can be calculated as follows:
Receivables turnover

Because Diane’s Java is a wholesaler, let’s assume that all of its sales are credit sales. 
Average receivables equals the simple average of 2012’s receivables and 2011’s receivables.

Dividing 365 by the figure for receivables turnover, 19.6, equals the average age of 
receivables, 18.62 days. Assume Diane’s Java expects its retail customers to pay outstanding 
bills within 30 days of the date of purchase. Given that the average age of its receivables is 
less than 30 days, Diane’s Java appears to be doing a good job collecting its credit sales.
Another measure of efficiency is total asset turnover. It measures how much in sales each 
dollar invested in assets generates:

Average total assets for Diane’s Java equals total assets as of December 31, 2012 ($8.79 
million) plus total assets as of December 31, 2011 ($7.305 million) divided by 2.
Diane’s Java generates about $2.15 in sales for each dollar invested in assets. Although a 
higher ratio generally indicates that a firm is operating more efficiently, care must be taken 
when comparing firms that operate in different industries. Some industries simply require 
higher investment in assets than do other industries. 
Profitability Ratios
Some ratios measure the organization’s overall financial performance by evaluating its 
ability to generate revenues in excess of operating costs and other expenses. These measures 
are called profitability ratios. To compute these ratios, accountants compare the firm’s earn-
ings with total sales or investments. Over a period of time, profitability ratios may reveal the 
effectiveness of management in operating the business. Three important profitability ratios 
are gross profit margin, net profit margin, and return on equity:

⎤⎦⎥
 37.9%
All of these ratios indicate positive evaluations of the current 
operations of Diane’s Java. For example, the net profit margin indi-
cates that the firm realizes a profit of slightly more than 11 cents on 
each dollar of merchandise it sells. Although this ratio varies widely 
among business firms, Diane’s Java compares favorably with whole-
salers in general, which have an average net profit margin of around 
5 percent. However, this ratio, like the other profitability ratios, 
should be evaluated in relation to profit forecasts, past performance, 
or more specific industry averages to enhance the interpretation of 
results. Similarly, while the firm’s return on equity of almost 38 per-
cent appears outstanding, the degree of risk in the industry also must 
be considered.
Leverage Ratios
Leverage ratios measure the extent to which a firm relies on debt 
financing. They provide particularly interesting information to poten-
tial investors and lenders. If management has assumed too much debt 
in financing the firm’s operations, problems may arise in meeting 
future interest payments and repaying outstanding loans. As we discuss 
in Chapter 17, borrowing money does have advantages. However, rely-
ing too heavily on debt financing may lead to bankruptcy. More gener-
ally, both investors and lenders may prefer to deal with firms whose 
owners have invested enough of their own money to avoid overreliance

.64%
A total liabilities to total assets ratio greater than 50 percent indicates that a firm is rely-
ing more on borrowed money than owners’ equity. Because Diane’s Java’s total liabilities 
to total assets ratio is 35.6 percent, the firm’s owners have invested considerably more than 
the total amount of liabilities shown on the firm’s balance sheet. Moreover, the firm’s long-
term debt to equity ratio is only 19.64 percent, indicating that Diane’s Java has only about 
19.6 cents in long-term debt to every dollar in equity. The long-term debt to equity ratio 
also indicates that Diane’s Java hasn’t relied very heavily on borrowed money.
The four categories of financial ratios relate balance sheet and income statement data 
to one another, help management pinpoint a firm’s strengths and weaknesses, and indicate 
areas in need of further investigation. Large, multiproduct firms that operate in diverse mar-
kets use their information systems to update their financial ratios every day or even every 
hour. Each company’s management must decide on an appropriate review schedule to avoid 
the costly and time-consuming mistake of overmonitoring.
In addition to calculating financial ratios, managers, investors, and lenders should pay 
close attention to how accountants applied a number of accounting rules when prepar-
ing financial statements. GAAP gives accountants leeway in reporting certain revenues and 
expenses. Public companies are required to disclose, in footnotes to the financial statements, 
how the various accounting rules were applied.
Budgeting
Although the financial statements discussed in this chapter focus on past business activi-
ties, they also provide the basis for planning in the future. A budget is a planning and 
controlling tool that reflects the firm’s expected sales revenues, operating expenses, and 
cash receipts and outlays. It quantifies the firm’s plans for a specified future period. Because 
it reflects management estimates of expected sales, cash inflows and outflows, and costs, 
the budget is a financial blueprint and can be thought of as a short-term financial plan. It 
becomes the standard for comparison against actual performance.
Budget preparation is frequently a time-consuming task that involves many people from 
various departments within the organization. The complexity of the budgeting process var-
ies with the size and complexity of the organization. Large corporations such as United 
Technologies, Paramount Pictures, and Verizon maintain complex and sophisticated bud-
geting systems. Their budgets help managers integrate their numerous divisions in addition 
to serving as planning and controlling tools. But budgeting in both large and small firms is 
similar to household budgeting in its purpose: to match income and expenses in a way that 
accomplishes objectives and correctly times cash inflows and outflows.
Because the accounting department is an organization’s financial nerve center, it pro-
vides much of the data for budget development. The overall master, or operating, budget is

actually a composite of many individual budgets for separate units of the firm. These indi-
vidual budgets typically include the production budget, cash budget, capital expenditures 
budget, advertising budget, and sales budget.
Technology has improved the efficiency of the budgeting process. The accounting 
software products discussed earlier—such as QuickBooks—all include budgeting features. 
Moreover, modules designed for specific businesses are often available from third parties. Many 
banks now offer their customers personal financial management tools (PFMs) developed by 
software companies. One such tool is FinanceWorks, an online finance program from Intuit’s 
Digital Insight division. BBVA, a multinational Spanish banking group, offers Tu Cuentas 
(“you count”), based on a PFM program from Strands, a California software developer.10
One of the most important budgets prepared by firms is the cash budget. The cash 
budget, usually prepared monthly, tracks the firm’s cash inflows and outflows. Figure 15.7 
illustrates a sample cash budget for Birchwood Paper, a small Maine-based paper products 
company. The company has set a $150,000 target cash balance. The cash budget indicates 
months in which the firm will need temporary loans—May, June, and July—and how much 
it will need (close to $3 million). The document also indicates that Birchwood will generate

Hong Kong was a British colony for almost 200 years until 1997, 
when Britain ceded it to the People’s Republic of China. China’s rise 
to global power has brought difficulties to the intersection between its 
financial environment and Hong Kong’s. Even after the turnover, Hong 
Kong and mainland China had two separate accounting systems with 
different standards and qualifying examinations. Hong Kong accounting 
is based on international standards and conducted in English; Chinese 
accounting is not.
At the beginning of 2010, Hong Kong accepted Chinese account-
ing standards. This step reflects China’s growing attractiveness to inter-
national investors. It also advances China’s ambition to be part of the 
international financial system, but until recently the Chinese accounting 
system has been notorious for its “book-cooking” scandals. And as 
Hong Kong’s transition to Chinese standards progresses, Hong Kong 
accountants risk losing substantial business to Chinese firms.  
Tim Lui, a tax partner at the Hong Kong branch of the worldwide 
accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, believes that in the short run, 
at least, Hong Kong accountants have a competitive edge due to their 
training and international perspective. Foreign investors will be glad 
to see that Chinese companies will be audited by large, international 
accounting firms. But he warns against complacency: “The mainland’s 
development is robust and fast and the market is immense.” 
Another concern is that small and medium-sized Hong Kong 
accounting firms simply aren’t big enough to succeed in China, espe-
cially in Shanghai, China’s business and accounting center. Robert 
Sawhney of SRC Associations Ltd., a Hong Kong accounting firm, urges 
these smaller firms to market themselves more aggressively and bring 
their training strategies up to date. He says that “there is substantial 
scope for Asian accounting firms to provide services to other organiza-
tions and in niche areas.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. How might the convergence of Chinese and internation-
ally accepted accounting methods affect Chinese firms’ 
operations and ethical standards?
2. What can Hong Kong accounting firms do to increase 
their business in mainland China?

a cash surplus in August and can begin repaying the short-term loan. Finally, 
the cash budget produces a tangible standard against which to compare actual

International Accounting
Today, accounting procedures and practices must be adapted to accom-
modate an international business environment. The Coca-Cola Company and 
McDonald’s both generate more than half their annual revenues from sales 
outside the United States. Nestlé, the giant chocolate and food products 
firm, operates throughout the world. It derives 98 percent of its revenues from 
outside Switzerland, its home country. International accounting practices for 
global firms must reliably translate the financial statements of the firm’s inter-
national affiliates, branches, and subsidiaries and convert data about foreign 
currency transactions to dollars. Also, foreign currencies and exchange rates 
influence the accounting and financial reporting processes of firms operating 
internationally.
As market economies in countries such as Poland and China have devel-
oped, the demand for accountants has increased. The “Hit & Miss” feature 
describes recent developments in the accounting profession in China and 
Hong Kong.
In Pakistan, a truck driver delivers Nestlé food 
products. Because the Swiss corporation operates 
around the world, its profits and its financial 
statements are affected by foreign exchange rates.

Exchange Rates
As defined in Chapter 4, an exchange rate is the ratio at which a country’s currency can 
be exchanged for other currencies. Currencies can be treated as goods to be bought and sold. 
Like the price of any product, currency prices change daily according to supply and demand. 
So exchange rate fluctuations complicate accounting entries and accounting practices.
Accountants who deal with international transactions must appropriately record their 
firms’ foreign sales and purchases. Today’s sophisticated accounting software helps firms 
handle all of their international transactions within a single program. An international firm’s 
consolidated financial statements must reflect any gains or losses due to changes in exchange 
rates during specific periods of time. Financial statements that cover operations in two or 
more countries also need to treat fluctuations consistently to allow for comparison.
In the United States, GAAP requires firms to make adjustments to their earnings that 
reflect changes in exchange rates. In general, a weakening dollar increases the earnings of 
a U.S. firm that has international operations because the same units of a foreign currency 
will translate into more U.S. dollars. By the same token, a strengthening dollar will have the 
opposite effect on earnings—the same number of units of a foreign currency will translate 
into fewer dollars. In one recent year, for example, currency fluctuations caused an $11 mil-
lion drop in earnings from the same quarter of the previous year for PPG, the world’s sec-
ond largest paint manufacturer.11
International Accounting Standards
The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) was established in 1973 to 
promote worldwide consistency in financial reporting practices. TheIASC soon developed its 
first set of accounting standards and interpretations and, in 2001, became the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) are the standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB. The IASB operates 
in much the same manner as the FASB does in the United States, interpreting and 
modifying IFRS.
Because of the boom in worldwide trade, there is a real need for comparability of and 
uniformity in international accounting rules. Trade agreements such as NAFTA and the 
expansion of the European Union have only heightened interest in creating a uniform set of 
global accounting rules. In addition, an increasing number of investors are buying shares in 
foreign multinational corporations, and they need a practical way to evaluate firms in other 
countries. To assist global investors, more and more firms are beginning to report their 
financial information according to international accounting standards. This practice helps 
investors make informed decisions.
Nearly 100 other countries currently require, permit the use of, or have a policy of con-
vergence with IFRS. These nations include members of the European Union, India, Australia, 
Canada, and Hong Kong. At first, the United States was skeptical of IFRS, even though major 
American accounting organizations have been involved with the IASB since its inception. In 
fact, the SEC used to require all firms whose shares were publicly traded in the United States to 
report financial results using GAAP. This rule applied regardless of where firms were located.
This requirement started to change some years back, when the FASB and the IASB met 
and committed to the eventual convergence of IFRS with GAAP. This agreement was further 
clarified in 2005. Around the same time, the SEC began to loosen its rules on the use of IFRS 
by foreign firms whose shares trade in the United States. Today, many foreign companies can

Chapter 15  Understanding Accounting and Financial Statements
Explain the functions of accounting, and identify the three 
basic activities involving accounting.
Accountants measure, interpret, and communicate financial 
information to parties inside and outside the firm to support 
improved decision making. Accountants gather, record, and 
interpret financial information for management. They also 
provide financial information on the status and operations 
of the firm for evaluation by outside parties, such as govern-
ment agencies, stockholders, potential investors, and lend-
ers. Accounting plays key roles in financing activities, which 
help start and expand an organization; investing activities, 
which provide the assets it needs to continue operating; and 
operating activities, which focus on selling goods and serv-
ices and paying expenses incurred in regular operations.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 Define accounting. Accounting is the process of mea-
suring, interpreting, and communicating financial informa-
tion in a way that describes the status and operation of an 
organization and aids in decision making.
1.2 Who uses accounting information? Managers of all 
types of organizations use accounting information to help 
them plan, assess performance, and control daily and long-
term operations. Outside users of accounting information 
include government officials, investors, creditors, and donors.
1.3 What are the three business activities that involve 
accounting? The three activities involving accounting are 
financing, investing, and operating activities.
Describe the roles played by public, management, govern-

Public accountants provide accounting services to other 
firms or individuals for a fee. They are involved in such 
activities as auditing, tax return preparation, management 
consulting, and accounting system design. Management 
accountants collect and record financial transactions, pre-
pare financial statements, and interpret them for managers 
in their own firms. Government and not-for-profit account-
ants perform many of the same functions as management

report results using IFRS as long as they reconcile these results to GAAP in a footnote. Some 
large U.S. companies were allowed to use international accounting standards beginning in 
2009. By 2016, all U.S. firms will be required to do so. Almost half the companies polled in a 
recent survey said they wanted an option for early adoption of the standards.12
How does IFRS differ from GAAP? Although many similarities between IFRS and 
GAAP exist, there are some important differences. For example, under GAAP, plant, prop-
erty, and equipment is reported on the balance sheet at the historical cost minus depre-
ciation. Under IFRS, on the other hand, plant, property, and equipment is shown on the 
balance sheet at current market value. This gives a better picture of the real value of a firm’s 
assets. Many accounting experts believe that IFRS is overall less complicated than GAAP and 
more transparent.13
What’s Ahead
This chapter describes the role of accounting in an organization. Accounting is the 
process of measuring, interpreting, and communicating financial information to interested 
parties both inside and outside the firm. The next two chapters discuss the finance function 
of an organization. Finance deals with planning, obtaining, and managing the organiza-
tion’s funds to accomplish its objectives in the most efficient and effective manner possible. 
Chapter 16 outlines the financial system, the system by which funds are transferred from 
savers to borrowers. Organizations rely on the financial system to raise funds for expansion 
or operations. The chapter includes a description of financial institutions, such as banks; 
financial markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange; financial instruments, such as 
stocks and bonds; and the role of the Federal Reserve System. Chapter 17 discusses the role 
of finance and the financial manager in an organization.

The foundation of the accounting system in the United 
States is GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles), a 
set of guidelines or standards that accountants follow. There 
are four basic requirements to which all accounting rules 
should adhere: consistency, relevance, reliability, and compa-
rability. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), 
an independent body made up of accounting professionals, 
is primarily responsible for evaluating, setting, and modify-
ing GAAP. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) also plays a role in establishing and modifying 
accounting standards for public companies, firms whose 
shares are traded in the financial markets.

The accounting process involves recording, classifying, and 
summarizing data about transactions and then using this 
information to produce financial statements for the firm’s 
managers and other interested parties. Transactions are 
recorded chronologically in journals, posted in ledgers, and 
then summarized in accounting statements. Today, much of 
this activity takes place electronically. The basic account-
ing equation states that assets (what a firm owns) must 
always equal liabilities (what a firm owes creditors) plus 
owners’ equity. This equation also illustrates double-entry 
bookkeeping, the process by which accounting transactions 
are recorded. Under double-entry bookkeeping, each indi-
vidual transaction must have an offsetting transaction.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 List the steps in the accounting cycle. The account-
ing cycle involves the following steps: recording transactions, 
classifying these transactions, summarizing transactions, and 
using the summaries to produce financial statements.
4.2 What is the accounting equation? The accounting 
equation states that assets (what a firm owns) must always equal 
liabilities (what a firm owes) plus owners’ equity. Therefore, if 
assets increase or decrease, there must be an offsetting increase 
or decrease in liabilities, owners’ equity, or both.
4.3 Briefly explain double-entry bookkeeping. Double-
entry bookkeeping means that every transaction must have 
an offsetting transaction.
Explain the functions and major components of the four 
principal financial statements: the balance sheet, the 
income statement, the statement of owners’ equity, and 
the statement of cash flows.
The balance sheet shows the financial position of a company 
on a particular date. The three major classifications of balance 
sheet data are the components of the accounting equation: 
assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity. The income statement 
shows the results of a firm’s operations over a specific period. 
It focuses on the firm’s activities—its revenues and expendi-
tures—and the resulting profit or loss during the period. The 
major components of the income statement are revenues, cost 
of goods sold, expenses, and profit or loss. The statement of 
owners’ equity shows the components of the change in own-
ers’ equity from the end of the prior year to the end of the 
current year. Finally, the statement of cash flows indicates a 
firm’s cash receipts and cash payments during an accounting 
period. It outlines the sources and uses of cash in the basic 
business activities of operating, investing, and financing.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 List the four financial statements. The four financial 
statements are the balance sheet, the income statement, the 
statement of owners’ equity, and the cash flow statement.
5.2 How is the balance sheet organized? Assets (what a 
firm owns) are shown on one side of the balance sheet and 
are listed in order of convertibility into cash. On the other 
side of the balance sheet are claims to assets, liabilities (what a 
firm owes), and owners’ equity. Claims are listed in the order 
in which they are due, so liabilities are listed before owners’ 
equity. Assets always equal liabilities plus owners’ equity.
5.3 Define accrual accounting. Accrual accounting rec-
ognizes revenues and expenses when they occur, not when 
cash actually changes hands. Most companies use accrual 
accounting to prepare their financial statements.

Discuss how financial ratios are used to analyze a com-
pany’s financial strengths and weaknesses.
Liquidity ratios measure a firm’s ability to meet short-term 
obligations. Examples are the current ratio and the quick, or 
acid-test, ratio. Activity ratios, such as the inventory turno-
ver ratio, accounts receivable turnover ratio, and the total 
asset turnover ratio, measure how effectively a firm uses its 
resources. Profitability ratios assess the overall financial per-
formance of the business. The gross profit margin, net profit 
margin, and return on owners’ equity are examples. Leverage 
ratios, such as the total liabilities to total assets ratio and the 
long-term debt to equity ratio, measure the extent to which 
the firm relies on debt to finance its operations. Financial 
ratios help managers and outside evaluators compare a firm’s 
current financial information with that of previous years and 
with results for other firms in the same industry.
Assessment Check Answers 
6.1 List the four categories of financial ratios. The four cat-
egories of ratios are liquidity, activity, profitability, and leverage.
6.2 Define the following ratios: current ratio, inventory 
turnover, net profit margin, and debt ratio. The current ratio 
equals current assets divided by current liabilities; inventory 
turnover equals cost of goods sold divided by average inven-
tory; net profit margin equals net income divided by sales; the 
debt ratio equals total liabilities divided by total assets.
Describe the role of budgets in a business.
Budgets are financial guidelines for future periods reflecting 
expected sales revenues, operating expenses, and cash receipts 
and outlays. They reflect management expectations for future 
occurrences and are based on plans that have been made. 
Budgets serve as important planning and controlling tools by 
providing standards against which actual performance can be 
measured. One important type of budget is the cash budget, 
which estimates cash inflows and outflows over a period of time.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 What is a budget? A budget is a planning and control 
tool that reflects the firm’s expected sales revenues, operat-
ing expenses, cash receipts, and cash outlays.
7.2 How is a cash budget organized? Cash budgets are 
generally prepared monthly. Cash receipts are listed first. 
They include cash sales as well as the collection of past 
credit sales. Cash outlays are listed next. These include cash 
purchases, payment of past credit purchases, and operating 
expenses. The difference between cash receipts and cash 
outlays is net cash flow.
Outline accounting issues facing global business and the 
move toward one set of worldwide accounting rules.
One accounting issue that affects global business is 
exchange rates. An exchange rate is the ratio at which a 
country’s currency can be exchanged for other curren-
cies. Daily changes in exchange rates affect the account-
ing entries for sales and purchases of firms involved in 
international markets. These fluctuations create either 
losses or gains for particular companies. The International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was established to 
provide worldwide consistency in financial reporting 
practices and comparability of and uniformity in interna-
tional accounting standards. It has developed International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Many countries have 
already adopted IFRS, and the United States is in the proc-
ess of making the transition to it.
Assessment Check Answers 
8.1 How are financial statements adjusted for exchange 
rates? An exchange rate is the ratio at which a country’s 
currency can be exchanged for other currencies. Fluctuations 
of exchange rates create either gains or losses for particular 
companies because data about international financial trans-
actions must be translated into the currency of the country 
in which the parent company resides.
8.2 What is the purpose of the IASB? The International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was established to 
provide worldwide consistency in financial reporting prac-
tices and comparability and uniformity of international 
accounting rules. The IASB has developed the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Projects and Teamwork Applications
1. Contact a local public accounting firm and set up an interview 
with one of the accountants. Ask the individual what his or her 
educational background is, what attracted the individual to the 
accounting profession, and what he or she does during a typi-
cal day. Prepare a brief report on your interview. Do you now 
want to learn more about the accounting profession? Are you 
more interested in possibly pursuing a career in accounting?
2. Suppose you work for a U.S. firm that has extensive 
European operations. You need to restate data from the vari-
ous European currencies in U.S. dollars in order to prepare 
your firm’s financial statements. Which financial statements 
and which components of these statements will be affected?
3. Identify two public companies operating in different indus-
tries. Collect at least three years’ worth of financial statements 
for the firms. Calculate the financial ratios listed in Table 
15.1. Prepare an oral report summarizing your findings.
4. You’ve been appointed treasurer of a local not-for-profit 
organization. You would like to improve the quality of the 
organization’s financial reporting to existing and potential 
donors. Describe the kinds of financial statements you 
would like to see the organization’s accountant prepare. 
Why do you think better quality financial statements might 
help reassure donors?
5. Adapting the format of Figure 15.7, prepare on a sheet of 
paper your personal cash budget for next month. Keep in 
mind the following suggestions as you prepare your budget:
 
a. Cash inflows. Your sources of cash would include your 
payroll earnings, if any; gifts; scholarship monies; tax 
refunds; dividends and interest; and income from self-
employment.
 
b. Cash outflows. When estimating next month’s cash outflows, 
include any of the following that may apply to your situation:
 i. Household expenses (rent or mortgage, utilities, 
maintenance, home furnishings, telephone/cell phone, 
cable TV, household supplies, groceries)
 ii. Education (tuition, fees, textbooks, supplies)
 iii. Work (transportation, clothing)
 iv. Clothing (purchases, cleaning, laundry)
 v. Automobile (auto payments, fuel, repairs) or other 
transportation (bus, train)
 vi. Insurance premiums
• Renters (or homeowners)
• Auto
• Health
• Life
vii. Taxes (income, real estate, Social Security, Medicare)
viii. Savings and investments
ix. Entertainment/recreation (health club, vacation/travel, 
dining, movies)
x. 
Debt (credit cards, installment loans)
xi. Miscellaneous (charitable contributions, child care, 
gifts, medical expenses)
 
c. Beginning cash balance. This amount could be based 
on a minimum cash balance you keep in your check-
ing account and should include only the cash available 
for your use; therefore, money such as that invested in 
retirement plans should not be included.

Intacct Provides Accounting Software as a Service
As more businesses turn to cloud computing, they 
are making use of SaaS, or software as a service, instead 
of buying, installing, and maintaining software packages. 
With SaaS, a company subscribes to a Web site that leases 
software. The software remains on that provider’s serv-
ers. Any approved company employee can access it from 
anywhere—an in-office computer; an off-site notebook; 
or even a BlackBerry, iPhone, or other hand-held device 
with Internet capability. All data are saved and stored on 
the Web site’s servers. Smaller companies find SaaS offers 
many benefits. They don’t have to buy expensive software 
packages, administer the software and on-site servers, or 
hire IT personnel. 
Intacct, based in San José, California, was one of 
the first online SaaS providers of accounting software. 
More than 30,000 people across 3,000 companies use 
its products. Intacct provides two basic packages: Intacct 
Accounting Edition allows accounting firms and their cli-
ents to work on the same financial data simultaneously. It 
is used mostly by accounting firms whose clients have from 
five to 100 employees. The second package, called simply 
Intacct, is used by businesses that have grown too large 
to use QuickBooks or similar applications from Microsoft 
or Sage. These businesses generally have 25 to 1,000 
employees. In this case, the business has the software and 
controls access to it; the accounting firm logs in as a user. 
Daniel Druker, a senior vice president at Intacct, 
says, “Our research with the AICPA [American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants] shows a 50 percent productiv-
ity improvement for accounting firms that switch to SaaS—
plus roughly doubling in proactive consultation hours. And 
firms can serve around 10 percent more clients with the 
same staff, by reducing time for travel and error fixing.”
One of Intacct’s clients is ASP Global Services 
(ASPGS), a warehouse management solutions provider. 
Intacct’s software has enabled ASPGS to modernize and 
streamline its financial processes. The General Ledger pro-
gram has improved ASPGS’s ability to plan, budget, report, 
and analyze its business. The software also enables ASPGS 
to enter data faster and more efficiently without having to 
export those data into a program such as Microsoft Excel. 
Intacct allows ASPGS to see a real-time income statement 
at any given moment. As a result, ASPGS has more accu-
rate financial reporting and has saved a great deal of time 
and resources. 
Mike Mullane, the CEO of ASPGS, says, “Intacct is 
a huge time saver for us. With Intacct, there are a lot of 
processes you can set up once and then let them run auto-
matically going forward. This allows us to be more effec-
tive in managing the company and enables us to spend 
more time looking forward instead of constantly looking at 
what has already happened.”
Recently Intacct unveiled the latest edition of its 
financial management and accounting package. The pro-
gram, called Winter 2010, enables GAAP and analysis 
without the need for additional software. It also includes 
modules for such options as accounting, purchasing, busi-
ness intelligence, multicurrency support, and sales-tax 
management, among many others. Druker says about the 
new edition, “Our mindset is: If you’re a small business, 
why run a system like this yourself. You don’t have to 
install or configure a thing. We turn it on for you, and you 
use it as you would use Google or Amazon.”

BDO Seidman: Growing with the 20th Century 
and Beyond
In 1910, Maximillian Leonard Seidman (1888–1963), 
the son of Russian immigrants, founded the accounting 
firm of Seidman & Seidman in New York City. The profes-
sion of accounting was also brand new, but that situation 
soon changed.
When the income tax on individuals was estab-
lished in 1913 by the Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, Seidman recognized the potential for growth 
as accountants took on a new role in tax planning for 
individuals. And when Congress enacted legislation in 
1917 creating corporate income taxes, Seidman—now 
joined by two brothers—expanded the business to include 
corporations. The firm opened a second office in Michigan, 
just when the federal government converted furniture and 
woodworking factories to airplane manufacturing for 
WW I. Seidman & Seidman quickly became known 
for serving this industry when it developed a successful 
system for keeping track of furniture-plant costs.
Maximillian Seidman ran the firm for 45 years. He 
wrote many articles and served in many industry organi-
zations. He advocated “Total Involvement” of his firm’s 
employees in the business of their clients. In 1944 he 
declared, “It is the manner in which we serve our clients 
today that will determine whether we shall have them to 
serve as clients in the future.” 
Seidman & Seidman continued to expand, becom-
ing a truly national firm by the 1960s. In 1963, it joined 
other accounting companies from Canada, Britain, the 
Netherlands and (then West) Germany in an international 
organization. In 1973, these firms formed a new group 
called BDO (Binder Dijker Otte & Co.). This group, now 
called BDO International, is the fifth largest accounting 
firm in the world, with 1,138 branches in 115 countries. 
The U.S. member, BDO Seidman LLP, has 17 branches and 
more than 400 independent locations. 
Albert Lopez is the Southeast Regional Business Line 
Leader for Assurance Services at the Miami branch of BDO 
Seidman LLP. Its team-oriented approach and experience 
has enabled it to create and maintain long-term relation-
ships as its many clients endure the recent ups and downs 
of the economy. Lopez says, “Success is about service. In 
this economy, it is especially important to be collaborative 
and to bring a variety of offerings, including tax, assurance 
and consulting to the table . . . we want our clients to 
know that senior team members are always available.”
As BDO celebrates its 100th anniversary, it has 
received a number of industry honors. BDO recently 
announced that 39 of its U.S. offices (including Miami) 
had won the Alfred P. Sloan Award for Business Excellence 
in Workplace Flexibility. This award acknowledges the 
personal and workplace advantages of flexibility programs 
when a firm uses them to improve its effectiveness and to 
benefit its employees. Accounting Today magazine and Best 
Companies Group named BDO one of the “best accounting 
firms.” The Best Accounting Firms program identifies the 
best employers in the accounting industry and their ben-
efits to the U.S. economy, workforce, and businesses. And, 
the American Society of Women Accountants (ASWA) and 
the American Woman’s Society of CPAs (AWSCPA) both 
named BDO one of the “best 2010 CPA firms for women.”
Questions
1. What historic and economic factors do you think 
might have contributed to the growth and expan-
sion of the accounting industry, and Seidman’s 
firm, from the early 20th century to today?
2. What advantages does BDO Seidman LLP enjoy 
in belonging to a large, international group?

CASE 1.2
Case 15.2

531
Chapter 15  Understanding Accounting and Financial Statements
Pet Airways Is a “Feel-Good” Business
CASE 1.3
Case 15.3
It’s great to love the business you’re in, as do Alysa 
Binder and Dan Wiesel, co-founders of Pet Airways. They 
not only love their business, they also care for their cus-
tomers, who happen to be furry and four-legged. But Pet 
Airways, the only service devoted entirely to transporting 
cats and dogs around the country by air, is also a busi-
ness—which means that Binder and Wiesel must pay 
attention to the financial aspects of their company. “We’re 
doing something that’s a feel-good, do-good service and 
it’s absolutely rewarding,” says Dan Wiesel. But Wiesel 
knows that, without a thorough accounting of finances, 
any small business is likely to crash shortly after takeoff.
Binder and Wiesel started Pet Airways based on 
personal experience—they wanted a better, safer travel 
option for their Jack Russell terrier than being stashed in 
the cargo hold. With fluctuating temperatures and dark, 
cramped quarters, a trip aboard a commercial airline 
can be unsafe and traumatic for many animals. Binder 
and Wiesel, both of whom had backgrounds in business, 
decided they could do a better job than the passenger air-
lines by offering pet owners a choice.
As soon as they agreed on their business idea, Wiesel 
jumped into the financial questions. “I had to ask, ‘Is this 
a viable financial enterprise? What would people pay for 
a service like this?’” recalls Wiesel. He researched such 
issues as how much it would cost to retrofit the climate-
controlled cabin of a plane to carry animals; how much 
it would cost to fly a plane from one location to another; 
and how much it would cost to staff the company. He also 
researched how much demand there would really be for a 
pet airline, and how many pets would have to be booked 
on each flight in order for the trip to be profitable. He put 
all of these variables—and more—onto a spreadsheet so 
he could see what he and Binder would need to do for Pet 
Airways to take off.
Wiesel says that financial modeling, financial spread-
sheets, and good research on costs and pricing can make 
or break the launch of any small business. “Accounting 
itself is an absolute full-time, big job,” he admits. He 
wants to “know how much money is coming in, how much 
is going out, and what’s the bottom line.” In addition 
there are taxes, payroll, benefits, and other financial docu-
mentation. Wiesel advises that in many cases it’s a good 
idea for small businesses to contract out their accounting 
to professionals. He prefers this because outsourcing actu-
ally contains the cost of accounting.
Running a business is a balancing act, observes 
Wiesel. “You have to be able to reconcile how much 
cash you have with how you are going to spend it.” For 
example, as Pet Airways looks to expand to more cities, 
the firm has to consider the cost of adding more flights 
and more staff as compared to how many more customers 
it might attract. Binder points out that, while it’s exciting 
to think about growing, they have to factor in the expen-
ditures of everything from additional hiring to developing a 
more sophisticated Web site and online reservation system.
All of this comes back to a sound financial plan, says 
Wiesel. “The financial plan is really the core of it because 
you can play the ‘what if’ game. You can look at the 
implications of certain decisions.” For example, if Binder 
and Wiesel want to fly to a certain city, they can research 
which passenger airlines already serve that city. If it’s 
United Airlines, they know that pet owners will be charged 
$175 for an animal to fly beneath a passenger’s seat, or 
$250 to fly in the cargo hold. They can look at how many 
flights a day these airlines fly to the city, and probably 
learn how many pets are booked. And they can find out 
which terminal Pet Airways would use in addition to any 
airport taxes and fees. They can plug all this data into the 
financial plan and see if it works before making the final 
decision.
Binder and Wiesel usually agree on their company’s 
goals and objectives. Wiesel says it all boils down to one 
question: “What’s it going to cost you to achieve your 
plan?” Recently, Pet Airways announced its merger with 
the firm American Antiquities in a share-exchange agree-
ment, a major step toward expansion. “We are delighted 
to complete this transaction . . . and believe this event 
represents a significant step in implementing our business 
plan and continued expansion,” stated Wiesel.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. In Pet Airways’ accounting equation, what 
might be some of the firm’s liabilities? What 
might be considered its assets?
2. Identify the types of costs that Pet Airways 
might list on its income statement.
3. Why is it important for a small company like Pet 
Airways to prepare a regular budget?
4. If Pet Airways decides to expand its operations 
overseas, what kinds of accounting issues would 
the firm have to take into consideration?

Bank of America Weathers 
the Credit Crisis
 C an a bank offer too many services to its 
customers? Many analysts were asking that question 
about Bank of America recently.
The earliest ancestor of Bank of America was the 
Massachusetts Bank, which was founded in 1784 
and included John Hancock and Paul Revere among 
its customers. A number of mergers and acquisitions 
beginning in the 1970s resulted in Bank of America, 
based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Eventually the 
bank had more branches, customers, and checking 
accounts than any other American bank. After more 
mergers and acquisitions, the bank also had more 
credit card accounts than any other American bank. 
Countrywide Financial became a symbol of the 
recent financial crisis threatening the U.S. economy 
as one of a number of lenders that had issued 
subprime mortgages to home buyers with poor 
credit histories. As the financial crisis deepened, 
many of these home buyers were unable to pay 
their mortgages and went into foreclosure and 
bankruptcy, losing their homes. Bank of America 
bought Countrywide for the relatively low price of 
$4 billion. Bank of America was now the country’s 
largest lender of home mortgages. 
By the fall of 2008, Wall Street was facing the 
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
In September, Bank of America’s CEO, Kenneth 
D. Lewis, announced that the bank would acquire 
the prestigious investment firm Merrill Lynch for 
more than $50 billion. That instantly made Bank of 
America the country’s largest investment firm. For 
a brief time, Lewis won praise for his bold strategy. 
But he came under fire as critics charged that the 
price was too high. It also turned out that the bank 
had failed to reveal to its shareholders—who had 
voted to approve the deal—that Merrill Lynch had 
suffered severe losses. Lewis later lost his job and 
a group of shareholders sued the bank for not 
disclosing Merrill Lynch’s true financial condition. A 
federal judge imposed a settlement of $33 million 
on the bank. A few months later, the judge revised 
the settlement to $150 million.
As did several other banks, Bank of America took 
a $25 billion bailout from the federal government. 
When Merrill Lynch lost billions more, the 
government gave the bank another $20 million. 
Bank of America paid back those loans, but 
continued to lose money. Analysts expected 
the bank to lose even more money the 
following year.
Instead, Brian T. Moynihan, the new CEO, 
announced that Bank of America made a profit of 
$3.2 billion in the first quarter of the new year, 
even though Countrywide continued to lose money 
from consumer borrowers. Moynihan announced 
that profits from Merrill Lynch helped turn the bank 
around: “All our banking segments were able to 
make money this quarter except for one, home 
loans,” he said.1

Businesses, governments, and individu-
als often need to raise capital. Assume a 
businessperson forecasts a sharp increase in 
sales for the coming year, and this expected 
increase requires additional inventory. If the 
business lacks sufficient cash to purchase 
the needed merchandise, it may turn to a 
bank for a short-term loan. On the other 
hand, some individuals and businesses have 
incomes that are greater than their cur-
rent expenditures and wish to earn a rate of 
return on the excess funds. For instance, say 
your income this month is $3,000 but your 
expenditures are only $2,500. You can take 
the extra $500 and deposit it in your bank 
savings account, which pays you a rate of 
interest.
The two transactions just described are 
small parts of what is known as the financial 
system, the process by which money flows 
from savers to users. Virtually all businesses, 
governments, and individuals participate in 
the financial system, and a well-functioning 
one is vital to a nation’s economic well-
being. The financial system is the topic of 
this chapter.
We begin by describing the financial 
system and its components in more detail. 
Then, the major types of financial instru-
ments, such as stocks and bonds, are out-
lined. Next we discuss financial markets, 
where financial instruments are bought and 
sold. We then describe the world’s major 
stock markets, such as the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
Next, banks and other financial institu-
tions are described in depth. The structure 
and responsibilities of the U.S. Federal 
Reserve System, along with the tools the 
Fed uses to control the supply of money and 
credit, are detailed. The chapter concludes 
with an overview of the major laws and regu-
lations affecting the financial system and a 
discussion of today’s global financial system.

Understanding the Financial System
Households, businesses, government, financial institutions, and financial markets 
together form what is known as the financial system. A simple diagram of the financial sys-
tem is shown in Figure 16.1.
On the left are savers—those with excess funds. For a variety of reasons, savers choose 
not to spend all of their current income, so they have a surplus of funds. Users are the 
opposite of savers; their spending needs exceed their current income, so they have a deficit. 
They need to obtain additional funds to make up the difference. Savings are provided by 
some households, businesses, and the government, but other households, businesses, and 
the government are also borrowers. Households may need money to buy automobiles or 
homes. Businesses may need money to purchase inventory or build new production facilities. 
Governments may need money to build highways and courthouses.
Generally, in the United States, households are net savers—meaning that as a 
whole they save more funds than they use—whereas businesses and governments are net

users—meaning that they use more funds than they save. The fact that most of the net 
savings in the U.S. financial system are provided by households may be a bit of a surprise 
initially, because Americans do not have a reputation for being thrifty. Yet even though 
the savings rate of American households is low compared with those of other countries, 
American households still save hundreds of billions of dollars each year.
How much an individual saves is a function of many variables. One of the most impor-
tant is the person’s age. People often transition from net borrowers to net savers as they get 
older. When you graduate from college and begin a career, you likely have little in the way 
of savings. In fact, you may be deeply in debt. In the early years of your career, you may 
spend more than you make as you acquire major assets, such as a home. So in these early 
years your net worth—the difference between what you own and what you owe—is very low 
and may even be negative. However, as your career progresses and your income rises, you 
will begin to build a financial nest egg to fund retirement and other needs. Your net worth 
will also increase. It will continue to increase until you retire and begin drawing on your 
retirement savings.
Funds can be transferred between savers and users in two ways: directly and indirectly. A 
direct transfer means that the user raises the needed funds directly from savers. While direct 
transfers occur, the vast majority of funds flow through either financial markets or financial 
institutions. For example, assume a local school district needs to build a new high school. 
The district doesn’t have enough cash on hand to pay for the school construction costs, so it 
sells bonds to investors (savers) in the financial market. The district uses the proceeds from 
the sale to pay for the new school and in return pays bond investors interest each year for 
the use of their money. 
The other way in which funds can be transferred indirectly is through financial insti-
tutions—for example, a commercial bank such as Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank or 
Alabama-based Regions Bank. The bank pools customer deposits and uses the funds to make

TD Bank: “As Green as Our Logo”
TD Bank’s square, green logo is a familiar sight from Maine to 
Florida. TD Bank announced that it was the largest U.S. bank to go 
carbon neutral. The bank achieved carbon neutrality by reducing waste, 
using alternative sources of energy, and building environmentally 
friendly buildings from sustainable materials. With 1,000 branches, or 
“stores,” TD has used its resources to pursue an aggressive “green” 
policy. 
To demonstrate its goal of carbon neutrality, TD bank unveiled 
a new prototype store. The 3,800-square-foot design is designed to 
reduce energy use by 50 percent, compared with earlier models. Each 
new store will make up to 20 percent of its own electricity with solar 
panels on the roof. To keep interior temperatures comfortable, the 
windows will have specially coated glass that reflects or absorbs heat 
energy. Sensors will control lighting over the course of the day. The 
drive-through facility will also have a translucent solar canopy. Outside, 
the landscaping will feature drought-resistant plants and water-efficient 
plumbing.
Among other measures, TD Bank has bought a block of wind 
energy large enough to run its 2,300 ATMs. It plans to encourage its 
customers to save energy by emphasizing online banking and paperless 
statements. TD Bank has also located many of its branches near public 
transportation.
TD Bank’s first fully green office opened in Queens Village, New 
York. This branch has applied for LEED (Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design) Platinum Certification, the highest level. The 
bank eventually plans to have all of its offices meet LEED standards.
Fred Graziano, TD Bank’s head of retail banking, says, “We’re tak-
ing the environment seriously and we strongly believe this is the right 
thing to do for our business, customers, employees and the community. 
We want TD Bank to be as green as our logo.” 
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Why does “going green” make good business sense for 
TD Bank?
2. Think about your own banking practices. What steps 
could you take to make them greener?

loans to businesses and households. These borrowers pay the bank interest, and it, in turn, 
pays depositors interest for the use of their money. 
The accompanying “Going Green” feature describes how TD Bank has begun trans-
forming all its branches so that they will be “carbon neutral.”
Types of Securities
For the funds they borrow from savers, businesses and governments provide different 
types of guarantees for repayment. Securities, also called financial instruments, represent 
obligations on the part of the issuers—businesses and governments—to provide the pur-
chasers with expected or stated returns on the funds invested or loaned. Securities can be 
grouped into three categories: money market instruments, bonds, and stock. Money market 
instruments and bonds are both debt securities. Stocks are units of ownership in corpora-
tions like General Electric, Best Buy, 3M, and PepsiCo.
Money Market Instruments
Money market instruments are short-term debt securities issued by governments, financial 
institutions, and corporations. All money market instruments mature within one year from 
the date of issue. The issuer pays interest to the investors for the use of their funds. Money

market instruments are generally low-risk securities and are purchased by investors when 
they have surplus cash. Examples of money market instruments include U.S. Treasury bills, 
commercial paper, and bank certificates of deposit.
Treasury bills are short-term securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and backed by the 
full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Treasury bills are sold with a maturity of 30, 90, 
180, or 360 days and have a minimum denomination of $1,000. They are considered virtu-
ally risk free and easy to resell. Commercial paper is securities sold by corporations, such as 
Raytheon, that mature in from 1 to 270 days from the date of issue. Although slightly riskier 
than Treasury bills, commercial paper is still generally considered a very low-risk security.
A certificate of deposit (CD) is a time deposit at a financial institution, such as a com-
mercial bank, savings bank, or credit union. The sizes and maturity dates of CDs vary con-
siderably and can often be tailored to meet the needs of purchasers. CDs in denominations 
of $250,000 or less per depositor are federally insured. CDs in larger denominations are not 
federally insured but can be sold more easily before they mature.
Bonds
Bondholders are creditors of a corporation or government body. By selling bonds, a 
firm obtains long-term debt capital. Federal, state, and local governments also acquire funds 
through bonds. Bonds are issued in various denominations, or face values, usually between 
$1,000 and $25,000. Each issue indicates a rate of interest to be paid to the bondholder—
stated as a percentage of the bond’s face value—as well as a maturity date on which the 
bondholder is paid the bond’s full face value. Because bondholders are creditors, they have 
a claim on the firm’s assets that must be satisfied before any claims of stockholders in the 
event of the firm’s bankruptcy, reorganization, or liquidation.
Types of Bonds A prospective bond investor can choose among a variety of 
bonds. The major types of bonds are summarized in Table 16.1. Government bonds are bonds 
sold by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Because government bonds are backed by the 
full faith and credit of the U.S. government, they are considered the least risky of all bonds. 
The Treasury sells bonds that mature in 2, 5, 10, and 30 years from the date of issue.
Municipal bonds are bonds issued by state or local governments. Two types of municipal 
bonds are available. A revenue bond is a bond issue whose proceeds will be used to pay for a 
project that will produce revenue, such as a toll road or bridge. The Oklahoma Turnpike 
Authority has issued such bonds. A general obligation bond is a bond whose proceeds are to 
be used to pay for a project that will not produce any revenue, such as a new Indiana State 
Police Post. General obligation bonds can be sold only by states or local governmental 
units—such as Grand Rapids, Michigan, or Bergen County, New Jersey—that have the 
power to levy taxes. An important feature of municipal bonds is that their interest payments 
are exempt from federal income tax. Because of this attractive feature, municipal bonds gen-
erally carry lower interest rates than either corporate or government bonds.
Corporate bonds are a diverse group and often vary based on the collateral—the prop-
erty pledged by the borrower—that backs the bond. For example, a secured bond is backed by 
a specific pledge of company assets. These assets are collateral, just like a home is collateral 
for a mortgage. However, many firms also issue unsecured bonds, called debentures. These 
bonds are backed only by the financial reputation of the issuing corporation.
Another popular type of bond is the mortgage pass-through security. These securities 
are backed by a pool of mortgage loans purchased from lenders, such as savings banks.

As borrowers make their monthly mortgage payments, these payments are “passed through” 
to the holders of the securities. Most mortgage pass-through securities are relatively safe 
because all mortgages in the pool are insured. However, in recent years, mortgage pass-
through securities consisting of pools of so-called subprime mortgages, loans made to bor-
rowers with poor credit ratings, were issued. Many of these securities turned out to be quite 
risky and, in part, triggered what became known as the credit crisis. The extent of the crisis 
forced the federal government to undertake a massive bailout of the financial system. The 
Office of Financial Stability—part of the U.S. Treasury department—was created to purchase 
poor-quality mortgage-backed and other securities from financial institutions.
Quality Ratings for Bonds Two factors determine the price of a bond: its risk 
and its interest rate. Bonds vary considerably in terms of risk. One tool bond investors use to 
assess the risk of a bond is its bond rating. Several investment firms rate corporate and munic-
ipal bonds, the best known of which are Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s, and Fitch. 
Table 16.2 lists the S&P bond ratings. Moody’s and Fitch use similar rating systems. Bonds 
with the lowest level of risk are rated AAA. As ratings descend, risk increases. Bonds with 
ratings of BBB and above are classified as investment-grade bonds. By contrast, bonds with rat-
ings of BB and below are classified as speculative or junk bonds. Junk bonds attract investors by

offering high interest rates in exchange for greater risk. Today, junk bonds pay about 50 per-
cent more in interest than do investment-grade corporate bonds. The credit crisis of recent 
years generated a great deal of criticism of the ratings companies.
The second factor affecting the price of a bond is its interest rate. Other things being 
equal, the higher the interest rate, the higher the price of a bond. However, everything else 
often is not equal; the bonds may not be equally risky, or one may have a longer maturity. 
Investors must evaluate the trade-offs involved.
Another important influence on bond prices is the market interest rate. Because bonds 
pay fixed rates of interest, as market interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa. For 
instance, the price of a ten-year bond, paying 5 percent per year, would fall by about 8 per-
cent if market interest rates rose from 5 percent to 6 percent.
Most corporate and municipal bonds, and some government bonds, are callable. A call 
provision allows the issuer to redeem the bond before its maturity at a specified price. Not 
surprisingly, issuers tend to call bonds when market interest rates are declining. For example, 
if York County, Pennsylvania, had $50 million in bonds outstanding with a 5 percent annual 
interest rate, it would pay $2.5 million annually in interest. If interest rates decline to 3 per-
cent, the county may decide to call the 5 percent bonds, repaying the principal from the 
proceeds of newly issued 3 percent bonds. Calling the 5 percent bonds and issuing 3 percent 
bonds will save the county $1 million a year in interest payments. The savings in annual inter-
est expense should more than offset the cost of retiring the old bonds and issuing new ones.
Stock
The basic form of corporate ownership is embodied in common stock. Purchasers 
of common stock are the true owners of a corporation. Holders of common stock vote on 
major company decisions, such as purchasing another company or electing a board of direc-
tors. In return for the money they invest, they expect to receive some sort of return.

This return can come in the form of cash dividend payments, expected price appreciation, or 
both. Dividends vary widely from firm to firm. As a general rule, faster-growing companies 
pay less in dividends because they need more funds to finance their growth. Consequently, 
investors expect stocks paying little or no cash dividends to show greater price appreciation 
compared with stocks paying more generous cash dividends.
Sometimes unforeseen events can have a profound effect on dividends. On April 20, 
2010, the oil-drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, leased by the British oil firm BP, exploded and 
caught fire, killing 11 oil workers and injuring others. The oil well, off the southeast coast of 
Louisiana, began leaking millions of gallons of crude oil and methane, endangering countless 
fish, birds, and other marine animals in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the first oil rig disaster 
of this magnitude to occur in the United States. Fishermen and others who made their liv-
ing on the gulf saw their livelihoods threatened. The oil reached land, polluting the wetlands 
and beaches of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, harming wildlife there as well 
as damaging the tourist industry. Local residents, the media, and government figures were 
severe in condemning BP for not preventing the explosion and spill in the first place, for not 
capping the leaking well quickly and efficiently, for underestimating the quantities of leaking 
oil and methane, and for assembling insufficient forces and equipment for the cleanup.
Amid intense public and political pressure, BP launched an advertising campaign in print 
and on television, featuring its CEO, Tony Hayward, promising to “make this right.” In 
early June, more than 40 members of Congress called on BP to suspend its dividends, stop 
the ad campaign, and instead use that money to clean up the oil spill. BP’s stock began to 
fall, and Standard & Poor’s downgraded BP’s debt rating from AA-minus to A, hinting that 
it might downgrade that rating further. BP’s chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, announced 
that BP would cancel dividend payments to shareholders for the first quarter of the fiscal 
year and suspend dividend payments to shareholders for the second and third quarters. 
Before the disaster, BP had been Britain’s largest company, but in the following months 
its value fell by half. Although the dividend suspension is not likely to have a severe affect 
on American shareholders, many investors and retirees in Britain rely on those dividends for 
income. In fact, BP’s stock is the source of roughly 12 percent of all dividends paid on the 
London Stock Exchange. 
BP also agreed to create a fund to pay damages to fishermen, small-business owners, 
and others with financial losses caused by the oil spill. The fund, which will eventually total 
$20 billion and represents approximately one year’s profit, will be administered by a neutral 
third party. Anyone whose claim is turned down will have the right of appeal. Scientists 
estimated the well was leaking more than 2.5 million gallons a day, making it the largest 
oil-related disaster in U.S. history.2
Common stockholders benefit from company success, and they risk the loss of their 
investments if the company fails. If a firm dissolves, claims of creditors must be satisfied 
before stockholders receive anything. Because creditors have the first (or senior) claim to 
assets, holders of common stock are said to have a residual claim on company assets.
The market value of a stock is the price at which the stock is currently selling. For 
example, Johnson & Johnson’s stock price fluctuated between $59 and $69 per share during 
a recent year. What determines this market value is complicated; many variables cause stock 
prices to move up or down. However, in the long run stock prices tend to follow a com-
pany’s profits.
Preferred Stock In addition to common stock, a few companies also issue pre-
ferred stock—stock whose holders receive preference in the payment of dividends. General

Motors and Ford are examples of firms with preferred stock outstanding. Also, if a company 
is dissolved, holders of preferred stock have claims on the firm’s assets that are ahead of the 
claims of common stockholders. On the other hand, preferred stockholders rarely have any 
voting rights, and the dividend they are paid is fixed, regardless of how profitable the firm 
becomes. Therefore, although preferred stock is legally classified as equity, many investors 
consider it to be more like a bond than common stock.
Convertible Securities Companies may issue bonds or preferred stock that 
contains a conversion feature. Such bonds or stock are called convertible securities. This fea-
ture gives the bondholder or preferred stockholder the right to exchange the bond or pre-
ferred stock for a fixed number of shares of common stock. Convertible bonds pay lower 
interest rates than those lacking conversion features, helping to reduce the interest expense 
of the issuing firms. Investors are willing to accept these lower interest rates because they 
value the potential for additional gains if the price of the firm’s stock increases. For instance, 
at a price of $61 per share, Peabody Energy’s convertible bond would have a common stock 
value of at least $1,043 ($61  17.1). Should the price of Peabody’s common stock increase 
by $10 per share, the value of the convertible will increase by at least $171.
Financial Markets
Securities are issued and traded in financial markets. While there are many different 
types of financial markets, one of the most important distinctions is between primary and 
secondary markets. In the primary markets, firms and governments issue securities 
and sell them initially to the general public. When a company needs capital to purchase 
inventory, expand a plant, make major investments, acquire another firm, or pursue other

business goals, it may sell a bond or stock issue to the investing public. For example, Russian 
Nanotechnologies Corporation planned to sell $1.7 billion in bonds to pay for expansion and 
new projects. Similarly, with a massive budget deficit, California offered as much as $3.4 bil-
lion in Build America Bonds, which were part of the recent federal stimulus package.3
A stock offering gives investors the opportunity to purchase ownership shares in a 
firm such as the well-known drug maker Amgen and to participate in its future growth, in 
exchange for providing current capital. When a company offers stock for sale to the general 
public for the first time, it is called an initial public offering (IPO). Many of these offerings were 
from Asian companies.4 The “Hit & Miss” feature describes an American company’s IPO.
Both profit-seeking corporations and government agencies also rely on primary markets 
to raise funds by issuing bonds. For example, the federal government sells Treasury bonds 
to finance part of federal outlays such as interest on outstanding federal debt. State and local 
governments sell bonds to finance capital projects such as the construction of sewer systems, 
streets, and fire stations.
Announcements of new stock and bond offerings appear daily in business publications 
such as The Wall Street Journal. These announcements are often in the form of a simple 
black-and-white ad called a tombstone.
Securities are sold to the investing public in two ways: in open auctions and through 
investment bankers. Virtually all securities sold through open auctions consist of 
U.S. Treasury securities. A week before an upcoming auction, the Department of the 
Treasury announces the type and number of securities it will be auctioning. Treasury 
bills are auctioned weekly, but longer-term Treasury securities are auctioned once a

Not long ago, the banking giant Citigroup included not only bank-
ing but also insurance, among other interests. Following the recent 
financial crisis, Citigroup’s CEO, Vikram Pandit, began to dispose of 
some of these holdings. He wanted to slim the company down to 
its original core banking business, focusing on large institutions and 
wealthy individuals.
Primerica Inc. was one of those holdings. Based in Duluth, 
Georgia, Primerica sells life insurance, mutual funds, and other financial 
products door-to-door. Its middle-class clients earn from $30,000 to 
$100,000 a year. The company never fit well with the rest of Citigroup, 
and its 100,000 fiercely independent salespeople liked it that way. As 
the financial crisis worsened, some of them called for cutting ties with 
the parent company.
Citigroup tried to sell Primerica but could not find a buyer will-
ing to pay the asking price. So Citigroup announced that it would spin 
off Primerica instead. Primerica would issue an initial public offering 
(IPO), selling shares of stock for the first time. Primerica planned to 
sell 18 million shares at $12 to $14 a share. Under the terms of the 
IPO, Citigroup would take all the profits and keep Primerica’s existing 
accounts. Primerica would emerge smaller but would keep any new pol-
icies. John Addison and Rick Williams, the co-CEOs of Primerica, said, 
“We’re going to be a smaller, faster-growing company going forward.”
The IPO exceeded expectations. Primerica sold more than 21 
million shares at almost $20 each. Addison and Williams feel that 
the company’s focus has contributed to its success. “No one else has 
our business model,” Williams declared. “No one else focuses on the 
middle-income, middle market like we do.” Analysts took the IPO’s 
success as a sign that both the life insurance industry and the market 
were recovering from the recession.

month or once a quarter. Sales of most corporate and municipal securities are made via 
financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley. These institutions purchase the issue from 
the firm or government and then resell the issue to investors. This process is known as 
underwriting.
Financial institutions underwrite stock and bond issues at a discount, meaning that 
they pay the issuing firm or government less than the price the financial institutions charge 
investors. This discount is compensation for services rendered, including the risk financial 
institutions incur whenever they underwrite a new security issue. Although the size of the 
discount is often negotiable, it usually averages around 5 percent for all types of securities. 
The size of the underwriting discount, however, is generally higher for stock issues than it is 
for bond issues. For instance, underwriting discounts for IPOs are generally between 7 and 
10 percent.
Corporations and governments are willing to pay for the services provided by financial 
institutions because they are financial market experts. In addition to locating buyers for the 
issue, the underwriter typically advises the issuer on such details as the general character-
istics of the issue, its pricing, and the timing of the offering. Several financial institutions 
commonly participate in the underwriting process. The issuer selects a lead, or primary, 
financial institution, which in turn forms a syndicate consisting of other financial institutions. 
Each member of the syndicate purchases a portion of the security issue, which it resells to 
investors.
Media reports of stock and bond trading are most likely to refer to trading in the 
secondary market, a collection of financial markets in which previously issued securi-
ties are traded among investors. The corporations or governments that originally issued 
the securities being traded are not directly involved in the secondary market. They make 
no payments when securities are sold nor receive any of the proceeds when securities are 
purchased. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), for example, is a secondary market. In 
terms of the dollar value of securities bought and sold, the secondary market is four to five 
times as large as the primary market. Each day, roughly 1.6 billion shares worth about $45 
billion are traded on the NYSE.5 The characteristics of the world’s major stock exchanges 
are discussed in the next section.
Understanding Stock Markets
Stock markets, or exchanges, are probably the best-known of the world’s financial 
markets. In these markets, shares of stock are bought and sold by investors. The two largest 
stock markets in the world, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market, are 
located in the United States.
The New York Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange—sometimes referred to as the Big Board—is the most 
famous and one of the oldest stock markets in the world, having been founded in 1792. 
Today, more than 3,000 common- and preferred-stock issues are listed on the NYSE. These 
stocks represent most of the largest, best-known companies in the United States and have 
a total market value exceeding $13 trillion. In terms of the total value of stock traded, the 
NYSE is the world’s largest stock market.

For a company’s stock to be traded on the NYSE, the firm must apply to the exchange 
for listing and meet certain listing requirements. In addition, the firm must continue to meet 
requirements each year to remain listed on the NYSE. Corporate bonds are also traded on 
the NYSE, but bond trading makes up less than 1 percent of the total value of securities 
traded there during a typical year.
Trading on the NYSE takes place face-to-face on a trading floor. Buy and sell orders 
are transmitted to a specific post on the floor of the exchange. Buyers and sellers then bid 
against one another in an open auction. Only investment firms that are designated mem-
bers of the NYSE and that own at least one trading license are allowed to trade on the floor 
of the exchange. The NYSE issues up to 1,366 trading licenses a year at a cost of about 
$40,000 each.6
Each NYSE stock is assigned to a specialist firm. Specialists are unique investment firms 
that maintain an orderly and liquid market in the stocks assigned to them. Specialists must 
be willing to buy when there are no other buyers and sell when there are no other sellers. 
Specialists also act as auctioneers and catalysts, bringing buyers and sellers together.
Some observers portray the NYSE and its trading practices as somewhat old fashioned, 
especially in this technological age. Most markets, they note, have abandoned their trading 
floors in favor of electronic trading. However, even though the NYSE still retains a trading 
floor, the exchange has become highly automated in recent years. Its computer systems auto-
matically match and route most orders, which are typically filled within a few seconds.
The Nasdaq Stock Market
The world’s second-largest stock market is the Nasdaq Stock Market. It is very differ-
ent from the NYSE. Nasdaq—which stands for National Association of Securities Dealers 
Automated Quotation System—is actually a computerized communications network that 
links member investment firms. It is the world’s 
largest intranet. All trading on Nasdaq takes place 
through its intranet, rather than on a trading floor. 
Buy and sell orders are entered into the network 
and executed electronically. All Nasdaq-listed stocks 
have two or more market makers—investment 
firms that perform essentially the same functions as 
NYSE specialists.
Around 5,000 companies have their stocks 
listed on Nasdaq. Compared with firms listed on 
the NYSE, Nasdaq-listed corporations tend to be 
smaller, less well-known firms. Some are relatively 
new businesses and cannot meet NYSE listing 
requirements. It is not uncommon for firms even-
tually to transfer the trading of their stocks from 
Nasdaq to the NYSE—16 did so in a recent year. 
However, dozens of major companies currently 
trade on Nasdaq—such as Amgen, Cisco Systems, 
Dell, Intel, and Microsoft—that would easily meet 
NYSE listing requirements. For a variety of rea-
sons, these firms have decided to remain listed on 
Nasdaq.
Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq does not have a trading floor; 
all transactions are done electronically. Firms listed on the Nasdaq tend to be 
smaller and younger than the large, established firms listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

Other U.S. Stock Markets
In addition to the NYSE and Nasdaq, several other stock markets operate in the United 
States. The American Stock Exchange, or AMEX, focuses on the stocks of smaller firms, 
as well as other financial instruments such as options. In comparison with the NYSE and 
Nasdaq, the AMEX is tiny. Daily trading volume is generally less than 100 million shares 
compared with the +1 billion shares on each of the larger two exchanges.
Several regional stock exchanges also operate throughout the United States. They 
include the Chicago, Pacific (San Francisco), Boston, Cincinnati, and Philadelphia stock 
exchanges. Originally established to trade the shares of small, regional companies, the 
regional exchanges now list securities of many large corporations as well. In fact, more 
than half of the companies listed on the NYSE are also listed on one or more regional 
exchanges.
Foreign Stock Markets
Stock markets exist throughout the world. Virtually all developed countries and many 
developing countries have stock exchanges. Examples include Mumbai, Helsinki, Hong 
Kong, Mexico City, Paris, and Toronto. One of the largest stock exchanges outside the 
United States is the London Stock Exchange. Founded in the early 17th century, the 
London Stock Exchange lists approximately 3,000 stock and bond issues by companies from 
more than 70 countries around the world. Trading on the London Stock Exchange takes 
place using a Nasdaq-type computerized communications network.
The London Stock Exchange is the most international of all stock markets. Approximately 
two-thirds of all cross-border trading in the world—for example, the trading of stocks of 
American companies outside the United States—takes place in London. It is not uncommon 
for institutional investors in the United States to trade NYSE- or Nasdaq-listed stocks in 
London. 
Because stock markets around the world are so closely interconnected, changes 
in one country’s economy can affect other countries too, as the “Hit & Miss” feature 
explains.
ECNs and the Future of Stock Markets
For years a so-called fourth market has existed. The fourth market is the direct trading 
of exchange-listed stocks off the floor of the exchange, in the case of NYSE-listed stocks, or 
outside the network, in the case of Nasdaq-listed stocks. Until recently, trading in the fourth 
market was limited to institutional investors buying or selling large blocks of stock.
Now the fourth market has begun to open up to smaller, individual investors through 
markets called electronic communications networks (ECNs). In ECNs, buyers and sell-
ers meet in a virtual stock market and trade directly with one another. No specialist or 
market maker is involved. ECNs have become a significant force in the stock market in 
recent years. Around half of all trades involving Nasdaq-listed stocks take place on INET 
or Archipelago—the two largest ECNs—rather than directly through the Nasdaq sys-
tem. Some have suggested that ECNs represent the future for stock markets, given that 
INET and Archipelago were acquired within the last few years by Nasdaq and the NYSE, 
respectively.

The growth of computerized trading has closely connected all the 
developed nations and many of the developing nations. A snapshot of 
the world markets at the end of a recent month illustrates how events 
in one country influence stock markets everywhere.
In the spring of 2010, Americans grew hopeful that the 
country was starting to climb out of the worst financial crisis since 
the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve announced that although 
American households were not spending as much as before the 
recession, the U.S. economy was slowly improving. Some companies 
were making a profit from rising consumer demand. Earlier in the 
recovery, companies had made money by cutting costs. Prices of stock 
in U.S. companies such as Apple saw some increases. The computer 
giant Hewlett-Packard announced that it was buying the smart phone 
maker Palm.
The credit crisis that America seemed to be emerging from struck 
Greece, which warned that it might not be able to pay off its debts. As 
a member of the European Union, Greece has adopted the euro as its 
currency. Other euro countries, like Spain and Portugal, faced financial 
troubles as well. Standard & Poor’s reduced the bond rating of all three 
countries.
As it tried to recover, Greece adopted drastic measures, reducing 
government spending on social programs despite public protests. Prime 
Minister George Papandreou said that the public sector was “overly 
grown, overly expensive.” He hoped the austerity program would “give 
us a cushion” that would “give us quite a bit of money.”

Investor Participation in the Stock Markets
Because most investors aren’t members of the NYSE, or any other stock market, they 
need to use the services of a brokerage firm to buy or sell stocks. Examples of brokerage 
firms include Edward Jones and TD Ameritrade. Investors establish an account with the 
brokerage firm and then enter orders to trade stocks. The brokerage firm executes the trade 
on behalf of the investor, charging the investor a fee for the service. While some inves-
tors phone in orders or visit the brokerage firm in person, many today use their PCs and 
trade stocks online. The requirements for setting up an account vary from broker to broker. 
Selecting the right brokerage firm is one of the most important decisions investors make.
The most common type of order is called a market order. It instructs the broker to obtain 
the best possible price—the highest price when selling and the lowest price when buying. If 
the stock market is open, market orders are filled within seconds. Another popular type of 
order is called a limit order. It sets a price ceiling when buying or a price floor when selling. 
If the order cannot be executed when it is placed, the order is left with the exchange’s mar-
ket maker. It may be filed later if the price limits are met.
Financial Institutions
One of the most important components of the financial system is financial institutions. 
They are an intermediary between savers and borrowers, collecting funds from savers and 
then lending the funds to individuals, businesses, and governments. Financial institutions 
greatly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the transfer of funds from savers to users.

Because of financial institutions, savers earn more, and users pay less, than they would with-
out them. In fact, it is difficult to imagine how any modern economy could function without 
well-developed financial institutions. Think about how difficult it would be for a business-
person to obtain inventory financing or an individual to purchase a new home without finan-
cial institutions. Prospective borrowers would have to identify and negotiate terms with each 
saver individually.
Traditionally, financial institutions have been classified into depository institutions—
institutions that accept deposits that customers can withdraw on demand—and nondeposi-
tory institutions. Examples of depository institutions include commercial banks, such as US 
Bancorp and Sun Trust; savings banks, such as Golden West Financial Corporation and 
Ohio Savings Bank; and credit unions, such as the State Employees Credit Union of North 
Carolina. Nondepository institutions include life insurance companies, such as Northwestern 
Mutual; pension funds, such as the Florida state employee pension fund; and mutual funds. 
In total, financial institutions have trillions of dollars in assets. Figure 16.2 illustrates the size 
of the most prominent financial institutions.
Commercial Banks
Commercial banks are the largest and probably most important financial institution 
in the United States, and in most other countries as well. In the United States, the 
approximately 6,800 commercial banks have total 
assets of more than $12 trillion. Commercial banks 
offer the most services of any financial institution. 
These services include a wide range of check-
ing and savings deposit accounts, consumer loans, 
credit cards, home mortgage loans, business loans, 
and trust services. Commercial banks also sell 
other financial products, including securities and 
insurance.
Although 6,800 may sound like a lot of banks, the 
number of banks has actually declined dramatically 
in recent years; more than 25 years ago there were 
14,000 commercial banks. At the same time, banks 
have grown larger: today, the typical commercial bank 
is about five times as large as it was ten years ago. 
Both changes can be explained by the fact that bank 
mergers are commonplace.
Although the overall trend in the banking 
industry has been toward fewer, larger banks, a 
countertrend has also emerged: the growth of 
small community banks. It is not uncommon for 
several dozen of these banks to begin operation in 
any one year. Community banks typically serve a 
single city or county and have millions, rather than 
billions, of dollars in assets and deposits. Many 
consumers and small-business owners prefer 
smaller banks because they believe they offer a 
higher level of personal service and often charge 
lower fees.

How Banks Operate Banks raise funds by offering a variety 
of checking and savings deposits to customers. The banks then pool these 
deposits and lend most of them out in the form of consumer and business 
loans. At the end of a recent year, banks held over $8.3 trillion in depos-
its and had almost $6.3 trillion in outstanding loans.7 The distribution of 
outstanding loans is shown in Figure 16.3. As the figure shows, banks lend 
a great deal of money to both households and businesses for a variety of 
purposes. Commercial banks are an especially important source of funds 
for small businesses. When evaluating loan applications, banks consider 
the borrower’s ability and willingness to repay the loan. Occasionally, 
banks reject applications. 
Banks make money primarily because the interest rate they charge 
borrowers is higher than the rate of interest they pay depositors. Banks 
also make money from other sources, such as fees they charge customers 
for checking accounts and using automated teller machines. 
In the aftermath of the recent credit crisis, many small business owners 
have suffered because banks have begun pulling their lines of credit. The 
“Business Etiquette” feature offers some suggestions if this happens to you.
Electronic Banking More and more funds each year move 
through electronic funds transfer systems (EFTSs), computerized systems 
for conducting financial transactions over electronic links. Millions of 
businesses and consumers now pay bills and receive payments electronically. Most employ-
ers, for example, directly deposit employee paychecks in their bank accounts, rather than 
issuing employees paper checks. Today nearly all Social Security checks and other federal 
payments made each year arrive as electronic data rather than paper documents.
One of the original forms of electronic banking, the automated teller machine (ATM) 
continues to grow in popularity. ATMs allow customers to make banking transactions at any 
time by inserting an electronic card into the machine and entering a personal identification 
number (PIN). Networked systems enable ATM users to access their bank accounts in distant 
states and even throughout the world. Most banks now offer customers debit cards—also called 
check cards—that allow customers to pay for purchases directly from their checking or savings 
account. A debit card looks like a credit card but acts like a check and replaces the customer’s 
ATM card. Many large retailers—including Home Depot, Supervalu, Target, Walmart, and 
Walgreen’s—have installed special terminals that allow customers to use their ATM or debit 
cards to make purchases. Customers are required to enter their personal identification num-
bers and can often get cash back. Consumers enjoy the convenience of this feature; at the same 
time, it eliminates the problem of bad checks for retailers. The number of annual ATM and 
debit card transactions is expected to exceed almost 41 billion within the next couple of years.8
Online Banking Today, many consumers do some or all of their banking on the 
Internet. According to one survey, more than one-half of American households use some 
online banking services regularly.9 Two types of online banks exist: Internet-only banks, such 
as ING Direct, and traditional brick-and-mortar banks with Web sites, such as JPMorgan 
Chase and Citibank. A major reason people are attracted to online banking is convenience. 
Customers can transfer money, check account balances, and pay bills at any time.
Federal Deposit Insurance Most commercial bank deposits are insured by 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a federal agency. Deposit insurance

What to Do When Your Credit Gets Pulled
For years, banks have issued business credit cards to small business owners. 
The cards come with a line of credit—usually several thousand dollars or 
more—that gives these businesses a safety net in case a client was late in 
paying or some other emergency. After the credit crisis hit, millions of small 
business owners found themselves working without a net as banks began 
either to call those loans in or to cap credit lines at the amount outstanding. 
The National Small Business Association reported that thousands of small 
business owners reported that their credit lines had been decreased or that 
extensions of their loans had been rejected. Marilyn Landis of the NSBA said, 
“A few years ago, losing a line of credit was a crisis—today it’s the new 
normal.” Here are some steps to consider if this happens to you.
1 
Be careful not to max out whatever credit you have left; this could have a 
negative impact on your credit score.
2 
Make your current monthly payment as quickly as possible, either online 
or by phone.
3 
Apply for a new credit card as quickly as possible. It usually takes several 
weeks for any changes in your credit limit to appear in your credit report. 
If you act fast, you may get a new card before your credit score is low-
ered.
4 
If possible, pay down your existing credit card debt. However, if you know 
you’ll need money in the short run, weigh that need against your credit 
score before you write the check.
5 
Keep careful track of your credit score. AnnualCreditReport.com is the

you are legally entitled to.

means that, in the event the bank fails, insured 
depositors are paid in full by the FDIC, up to 
$250,000. Federal deposit insurance was enacted 
by the Banking Act of 1933 as one of the measures 
designed to restore public confidence in the bank-
ing system. Before deposit insurance, so-called 
runs were common as people rushed to withdraw 
their money from a bank, often just on a rumor 
that the bank was in precarious financial condi-
tion. With more and more withdrawals in a short 
period, the bank was eventually unable to meet 
customer demands and closed its doors. Remaining 
depositors often lost most of the money they had 
in the bank. Deposit insurance shifts the risk of 
bank failures from individual depositors to the 
FDIC. Although banks still fail today, no insured 
depositor has ever lost any money.
Savings Banks 
and Credit Unions
Commercial banks are by far the largest 
depository financial institution in the United 
States, but savings banks and credit unions also 
serve a significant segment of the financial commu-
nity. Today savings banks and credit unions offer 
many of the same services as commercial banks.
Savings banks used to be called savings and loan 
associations or thrift institutions. They were originally 
established in the early 1800s to make home mort-
gage loans. Savings and loans originally raised funds 
by accepting only savings deposits and then lent 
these funds to consumers to buy homes. Today, 
there are around 1,170 savings banks with total 
assets of about $1.26 trillion.10 Although savings 
banks offer many of the same services as commer-
cial banks, including checking accounts, they are 
not major lenders to businesses. About 82.6 percent 
of their outstanding loans are real estate loans.11 
Deposits in savings banks are now FDIC insured.
Credit unions are cooperative financial insti-
tutions that are owned by their depositors, all of 
whom are members. Around 90 million Americans 
belong to one of the nation’s approximately 8,000 
credit unions. Combined, credit unions have more 
than $825 billion in assets.12 By law, credit union 
members must share similar occupations, employ-
ers, or membership in certain organizations. This 

Part 6  Managing Financial Resources
550
law effectively caps the size of credit unions. In fact, 
the nation’s largest bank—Bank of America—holds 
more deposits than all the country’s credit unions 
combined. 
Credit unions are designed to serve consum-
ers, not businesses. Credit unions raise funds by 
offering members a number of demand and saving 
deposits—checking accounts at credit unions are 
referred to as share draft accounts—and then, in 
turn, lend these funds to members. Because credit 
unions are not-for-profit institutions, they often pay 
savers higher rates of interest, charge lower rates 
of interest on loans, and have fewer fees than other 
financial institutions. Credit unions can have either 
state or federal charters, and deposits are insured 
by a federal agency, the National Credit Union 
Administration (NCUA), which functions essentially 
the same way that the FDIC does.
Nondepository Financial Institutions
Nondepository financial institutions accept funds from businesses and households, 
much of which they then invest. Generally, these institutions do not offer checking accounts 
(demand deposits). Three examples of nondepository financial institutions are insurance 
companies, pension funds, and finance companies.
Insurance Companies Households and businesses buy insurance to transfer 
risk from themselves to the insurance company. The insurance company accepts the risk in 
return for a series of payments, called premiums. Underwriting is the process insurance com-
panies use to determine whom to insure and what to charge. During a typical year, insur-
ance companies collect more in premiums than they pay in claims. After they pay operating 
expenses, they invest this difference. Insurance companies are a major source of short- and 
long-term financing for businesses. Life insurance companies alone have total assets of more 
than $4.5 trillion invested in everything from bonds and stocks to real estate.13 Examples of 
life insurers include Prudential and New York Life.
Pension Funds Pension funds provide retirement benefits to workers and their 
families. They are set up by employers and are funded by regular contributions made by 
employers and employees. Because pension funds have predictable long-term cash inflows 
and very predictable cash outflows, they invest heavily in assets, such as common stocks and 
real estate. At one time, pension funds owned more than 25 percent of all common stocks. 
One study that compared U.S. pension funds and those in other countries found that even 
after the financial crisis, U.S. pension funds had more than 61 percent of their assets invested 
in stocks but only about 23 percent in less risky bonds; Germany, which was second, had 
only 34.5 percent in stocks and more than 61 percent in bonds. Recently, U.S. companies 
have begun quietly moving their pension assets out of stocks and have begun buying more 
long-term bonds. In contrast, some states and other government agencies, wanting to make 
up for funds lost in the crisis, have begun investing in higher-risk categories. In total, pen-
sion funds have more than $4.6 trillion in assets.14

Finance Companies Consumer and commercial finance companies, such as 
Ford Credit, John Deere Capital Corporation, and the Pennsylvania-based Dollar Financial, 
offer short-term loans to borrowers. A commercial finance company supplies short-term 
funds to businesses that pledge tangible assets such as inventory, accounts receivable, 
machinery, or property as collateral for the loan. A consumer finance company plays a simi-
lar role for consumers. Finance companies raise funds by selling securities or borrowing 
funds from commercial banks. Many finance companies, such as GMAC, are actually subsid-
iaries of a manufacturer. GMAC finances dealer inventories of new cars and trucks, as well as 
providing loans to consumers and other buyers of General Motors products.
Mutual Funds
One of the most significant types of financial institutions today is the mutual fund. Mutual 
funds are financial intermediaries that raise money from investors by selling shares. They then use 
the money to invest in securities that are consistent with the mutual fund’s objectives. For exam-
ple, a stock mutual fund invests mainly in shares of common stocks. Mutual funds have become 
extremely popular over the last few decades. The United States’ more than 7,600 mutual funds 
have more than $11 trillion in assets and more than 270 million shareholder accounts; 20 years 
ago, there were just over 3,000 funds with a total of just over $1 trillion in assets. One reason for 
this growth is the increased popularity of 401(k) and similar types of retirement plans. It is esti-
mated that about 47 percent of all 401(k) assets are invested in mutual fund shares.15
Mutual fund investors are indirect owners of a portfolio of securities. As the value of 
the securities owned by the mutual fund changes, so too will the value of the mutual fund’s 
shares. Moreover, investment income, such as bond interest and stock dividends, is passed 
through to fund shareholders.
Slightly less than half of mutual fund assets, around $5.2 trillion, are invested in stock 
funds. Money market mutual funds—those that invest in money market instruments such as 
commercial paper—are also popular. These funds have total assets of just over 2.6 trillion.16
The Role of the Federal 
Reserve System
Created in 1913, the Federal Reserve System, or Fed, or is the central bank of the 
United States and is an important part of the nation’s financial system. The Fed has four 
basic responsibilities: regulating commercial banks, performing banking-related activities for 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury, providing services for banks, and setting monetary 
policy. Not all banks belong to the Fed. Banks with federal charters are required to belong 
to the Fed, but membership is optional for state-chartered banks. Because the largest banks 
in the country are all federally chartered, the bulk of banking assets is controlled by Fed 
members. The Fed acts as the bankers’ bank for members. It provides wire transfer facilities, 
clears checks, replaces worn-out currency, and lends banks money.
Organization of the Federal Reserve System
The nation is divided into 12 federal reserve districts, each with its own federal reserve bank. 
Each district bank supplies banks within its district with currency and facilitates the clearing of 
checks. District banks are run by a nine-member board of directors, headed by a president.

The governing body of the Fed is the board of governors. The board consists of seven 
members, including a chair and vice chair, appointed by the president and confirmed by the 
Senate. A full term for a Fed governor is 14 years. If a governor serves a full term, he or she 
cannot be reappointed. A governor can be reappointed if he or she was initially appointed 
to an unexpired term. The chair and vice chair serve in those capacities for four years and 
can be reappointed. The chair of the board of governors is a very important position. Some 
have commented, only half jokingly, that the Fed chair is the second most powerful person 
in the nation.
The Fed is designed to be politically independent. Terms for Fed governors are stag-
gered in such a way that a president cannot appoint a majority of members, assuming that all 
members serve their entire terms. The Fed also has its own sources of revenue and does not 
depend on congressional appropriations.
An important part of the Fed is the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC). The 
FOMC sets most policies concerning monetary policy and interest rates. It consists of 12 
members—the 7 Fed board governors plus 5 representatives of the district banks, who serve 
on a rotating basis. The Fed chair is also chair of the FOMC.
Check Clearing and the Fed
As mentioned earlier, one of the Fed’s responsibilities is to help facilitate the clearing 
of checks. Even in this age of electronic and online banking, Americans still write billions of 
paper checks each year. The clearing of a check is the process by which funds are transferred 
from the check writer to the recipient.
Assume the owner of Gulf View Townhouses of Tampa buys a $600 carpet cleaner from 
the local Home Depot and writes a check. If Home Depot has an account at the same bank 
as Gulf View, the bank will clear the check in house. It will decrease the balance in the own-
er’s account by $600 and increase the balance in Home Depot’s account by $600. If Home 
Depot has an account at another bank in Tampa, the two banks may still clear the check 
directly with one another. This process is cumbersome, however, so it is more likely that the 
banks will use the services of a local check clearinghouse.
But if Home Depot has its account with a bank in another state—perhaps in Atlanta, 
where Home Depot is based—the check will likely be cleared through the Federal Reserve 
System. Home Depot will deposit the check in its Atlanta bank account. That bank, in 
turn, will deposit the check in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The Atlanta Federal 
Reserve bank will present the check to Gulf View’s bank for payment, which pays the check 
by deducting $600 from Gulf View’s account. Regardless of the method used, the Check 
Clearing for the 21st Century Act allows banks and the Fed to use electronic images of 
checks—rather than the paper documents themselves—during the clearing process. Because 
these images are transferred electronically, the time it takes to clear a check has been 
reduced substantially, often to less than 48 hours.
Monetary Policy
The Fed’s most important function is controlling the supply of money and credit, or 
monetary policy. The Fed’s job is to make sure that the money supply grows at an appro-
priate rate, allowing the economy to expand and inflation to remain in check. If the money 
supply grows too slowly, economic growth will slow, unemployment will increase, and the 

Chapter 16  The Financial System
553
risk of a recession will increase. If the money supply grows too rapidly, inflationary pressures 
will build. The Fed uses its policy tools to push interest rates up or down. If the Fed pushes 
interest rates up, the growth rate in the money supply will slow, economic growth will slow, 
and inflationary pressures will ease. If the Fed pushes interest rates down, the growth rate in 
the money supply will increase, economic growth will pick up, and unemployment will fall.
The two common measures of the money supply are called M1 and M2. M1 consists of 
currency in circulation and balances in bank checking accounts. M2 equals M1 plus balances 
in some savings accounts and money market mutual funds. Figure 16.4 shows the approxi-
mate breakdowns of M1 and M2. The Fed has four major policy tools for controlling the 
growth in the supply of money and credit: reserve requirements, the discount rate, open 
market operations, and Term Auction Facility loans.
The Fed requires banks to maintain reserves—defined as cash in their vaults plus depos-
its at district Federal Reserve banks or other banks—equal to a certain percentage of what 
the banks hold in deposits. For example, if the Fed sets the reserve requirement at 5 percent, 
a bank that receives a $500 deposit must reserve $25, so it has only $475 to invest or lend 
to individuals or businesses. By changing the reserve requirement, the Fed can affect the 
amount of money available for making loans. The higher the reserve requirement, the less 
banks can lend out to consumers and businesses. The lower the reserve requirement, the 
more banks can lend out. Because any change in the reserve requirement can have a sudden 
and dramatic impact on the money supply, the Fed rarely uses this tool. Reserve require-
ments range from 0 to 10 percent, depending on the type of account.
Another policy tool is the so-called discount rate, the interest rate at which Federal 
Reserve banks make short-term loans to member banks. A bank might need a short-term 
loan if transactions leave it short of reserves. If the Fed wants to slow the growth rate in the 
money supply, it increases the discount rate. This increase makes it more expensive for banks 
to borrow funds. Banks, in turn, raise the interest rates they charge on loans to consumers 
and businesses. The end result is a slowdown in economic activity. Lowering the discount 
rate has the opposite effect.

The third policy tool, and the one used most often, is open market operations, the tech-
nique of controlling the money supply growth rate by buying or selling U.S. Treasury secu-
rities. If the Fed buys Treasury securities, the money it pays enters circulation, increasing the 
money supply and lowering interest rates. When the Fed sells Treasury securities, money is 
taken out of circulation and interest rates rise. When the Fed uses open market operations 
it employs the so-called federal funds rate—the rate at which banks lend money to each other 
overnight—as its benchmark.
A relatively new monetary policy tool is the term auction facility. In these auctions, the 
Fed makes extra funds available to banks at low interest rates. A recent auction resulted in 
the Fed making $75 billion of 28-day loans to banks.17 The more funds the Fed offers, and 
the lower the rate, the greater the impact on market interest rates, the supply of credit, and 
economic activity. Table 16.3 illustrates how the tools used by the Federal Reserve can stim-
ulate or slow the economy.
The Federal Reserve has the authority to exercise selective credit controls when it thinks 
the economy is growing too rapidly or too slowly. These credit controls include the power 
to set margin requirements—the percentage of the purchase price of a security that an inves-
tor must pay in cash on credit purchases of stocks or bonds.
The Fed can also inject capital into the financial system in response to a financial cri-
sis. During the recent credit crisis, the Fed pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the 
financial system. The Fed even came to the rescue of AIG, a major insurance company, by 
purchasing some of the firm’s stock.
Transactions in the foreign exchange markets also affect the U.S. money supply 
and interest rates. The Fed can lower the exchange value of the dollar by selling dollars and

opposite—buying dollars and selling foreign currencies. When the Fed buys foreign curren-
cies, the effect is the same as buying securities because it increases the U.S. banking system’s 
reserves. Selling foreign currencies, on the other hand, is like selling securities, in that it 
reduces bank reserves.
Regulation of the 
Financial System
Given the importance of the financial system, it is probably not surprising that many 
components are subject to government regulation and oversight. In addition, industry self-
regulation is commonplace.
Bank Regulation
Banks are among the nation’s most heavily regulated businesses. The main purpose 
of bank regulation is to ensure public confidence in the safety and security of the banking 
system. Banks are critical to the overall functioning of the economy, and a collapse of the 
banking system can have disastrous results. Many believe that one of the major causes of the 
Great Depression was the collapse of the banking system that started in the late 1920s.
All banks, whether commercial or savings, and credit unions have either state or federal 
charters. Most commercial banks are state chartered; however, federally chartered banks 
control more than half of all banking assets. State-chartered banks are regulated by the 
appropriate state banking authorities; federally chartered commercial banks are regulated by 
the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller of the 
Currency. Furthermore, state-chartered commercial banks that are federally insured—and 
virtually all are—are also subject to FDIC regulation.
At the federal level, savings banks are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision and 
the FDIC. Federal credit unions are subject to NCUA regulation. State-chartered savings 
banks and credit unions are also regulated by state authorities.
Banks and credit unions are subject to periodic examination by state or federal regula-
tors. Examinations ensure that the institution is following sound banking practices and is 
complying with all applicable regulations. These examinations include the review of detailed 
reports on the bank’s operating and financial condition, as well as on-site inspections. 
Regulators can impose various penalties on institutions deemed not in compliance with 
sound banking practices, including forcing the delinquent financial institution into a merger 
with a healthier one.
Government Regulation of the Financial Markets
Regulation of U.S. financial markets is primarily a function of the federal government, 
although states also regulate them. Federal regulation grew out of various trading abuses 
during the 1920s. To restore confidence and stability in the financial markets after the 1929 
stock market crash, Congress passed a series of landmark legislative acts that have formed 
the basis of federal securities regulation ever since.

As noted in Chapter 15, the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission, created in 1934, is the 
principal federal regulatory overseer of the securi-
ties markets. The SEC’s mission is to administer 
securities laws and protect investors in public secu-
rities transactions. The SEC has broad enforce-
ment power. It can pursue civil actions against 
individuals and corporations, but actions requiring 
criminal proceedings are referred to the U.S. Justice 
Department.
The SEC requires virtually all new public issues 
of corporate securities to be registered. As part of 
the registration process for a new security issue, 
the issuer must prepare a prospectus. The typi-
cal prospectus gives a detailed description of the 
company issuing the securities, including financial 
data, products, research and development projects, 
and pending litigation. It also describes the stock or 
bond issue and underwriting agreement in detail. 
The registration process seeks to guarantee full 
and fair disclosure. The SEC does not rule on the 
investment merits of a registered security. It is concerned only that an issuer gives investors 
enough information to make their own informed decisions.
Besides primary market registration requirements, SEC regulation extends to the sec-
ondary markets as well, keeping tabs on trading activity to make sure it is fair to all partici-
pants. Every securities exchange must by law follow a set of trading rules that have been 
approved by the SEC. In addition, the Market Reform Act of 1990 gave the SEC emergency 
authority to halt trading and restrict practices such as program trading—whereby computer 
systems are programmed to buy or sell securities if certain conditions arise—during periods 
of extreme volatility.
One area to which the SEC pays particular attention is insider trading. Insider trading 
is defined as the use of material nonpublic information about a company to make invest-
ment profits. Examples of material nonpublic information include a pending merger or a 
major oil discovery, which could affect the firm’s stock price. The SEC’s definition of insider 
trading goes beyond corporate insiders—people such as the company’s officers and direc-
tors. It includes lawyers, accountants, investment bankers, and even reporters—anyone who 
uses nonpublic information to profit in the stock market at the expense of ordinary inves-
tors. Although some actions or communications are clearly insider trading, others are more 
ambiguous. Consequently, all employees of public companies have to be mindful of what is 
and isn’t permitted.
Securities laws also require every public corporation to file several reports each year 
with the SEC; the contents of these reports become public information. The best known, 
of course, is the annual report. Public corporations prepare annual reports for their share-
holders, and they file another report containing essentially the same information, Form 
10-K, with the SEC. The SEC requires additional reports each time certain company offi-
cers and directors buy or sell a company’s stock for their own accounts (Form 4) or anytime 
an investor accumulates more than 5 percent of a company’s outstanding stock (Form 13-d). 
All of these reports are available for viewing and download at the Edgar Online Web site

Industry Self-Regulation
The securities markets are also heavily self-regulated by professional associations and 
the major financial markets. The securities industry recognizes that rules and regulations 
designed to ensure fair and orderly markets promote investor confidence and benefit all par-
ticipants. Two examples of self-regulation are the rules of conduct established by the various 
professional organizations and the market surveillance techniques used by the major securi-
ties markets.
Professional Rules of Conduct Prodded initially by federal legislation, the 
National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) established and periodically updates rules 
of conduct for members—both individuals and firms. These rules are intended to ensure that 
brokers perform their basic functions honestly and fairly, under constant supervision. Failure 
to adhere to rules of conduct can result in disciplinary action. The NASD also established a 
formal arbitration procedure through which investors can attempt to resolve disputes with 
brokers without litigation.
Market Surveillance All securities markets use a variety of methods to spot 
possible violations of trading rules or securities laws. For example, the NYSE continuously 
monitors trading activity throughout the trading day. A key technical tool used by the NYSE 
is called Stock Watch, an electronic monitoring system that flags unusual price and volume 
activity. The NYSE then seeks explanations for unusual activity from 
the member firms and companies involved. In addition, all market 
participants must keep detailed records of every aspect of every trade 
(called an audit trail ). The NYSE’s enforcement division may impose 
a variety of penalties on members for rule violations. In addition, the 
exchange turns over evidence to the SEC for further action if it believes 
that violations of federal securities laws may have occurred.
Although self-regulation by the financial industry has been an 
important component of securities market regulation, some contend 
that the industry can never truly regulate itself effectively in today’s 
market environment. The “Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature 
debates the pros and cons of industry self-regulation.
The Financial System: 
A Global Perspective
Not surprisingly, the global financial system is becoming more 
and more integrated each year. As we’ve noted, financial markets exist 
throughout the world. Shares of U.S. firms trade in other countries, and 
shares of international companies trade in the United States. In fact, 
investors in China and Japan own more U.S. Treasury securities than do 
domestic investors.
Financial institutions have also become a global industry. Major 
U.S. banks—such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America—have 
extensive international operations. They have offices, lend money, and 
accept deposits from customers throughout the world.

Although most Americans recognize large U.S. banks such as Citibank among the 
global financial giants, only 3 of the 30 largest banks in the world (measured by total assets) 
are U.S. institutions—JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citibank. The largest of 
the three, JPMorgan Chase, ranks only eighth. The other 27 are based in Belgium, China, 
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 
The world’s largest bank, BNP Paribas SA, based in Paris, has almost $3.5 trillion in assets. 
These international banks also operate worldwide, including in the United States.18
Virtually all nations have some sort of a central bank, similar to the U.S. Federal 
Reserve. Examples include the Banks of Canada, England, and Japan and the European 
Central Bank. These central banks play roles much like that of the Fed, such as controlling 
the money supply and regulating banks. Policymakers at other nations’ central banks often 
respond to changes in the U.S. financial system by making similar changes in their own sys-
tems. For example, if the Fed pushes U.S. interest rates lower, central banks in Japan and 
Europe may also push their interest rates lower. These changes can influence events in coun-
tries around the world. Lower U.S. and European interest rates not only decrease the cost of

“Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending insti-

So said Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal 
Reserve Board, in testimony before Congress after the credit crisis. He 
had long supported the idea that the market could always be trusted to 
regulate itself and should be left free to do so. But with these words, he 
rejected that policy. The crisis brought an end to a Wall Street bubble 
that had flourished partly due to unlimited, unregulated speculation. 
Stricter government regulation of the financial industry seems inevitable.
Can Wall Street be trusted to regulate itself?
Summary
Public disapproval of Wall Street is bound to continue as long as the effects of the financial crisis 
unfold in people’s everyday lives. Congress has considered new, stricter regulations on financial institutions. 
Some argue that those regulations are unnecessary and could even be harmful.

What’s Ahead
This chapter explored the financial system, a key component of the U.S. economy and 
something that affects many aspects of contemporary business. The financial system is the 
process by which funds are transferred between savers and borrowers and includes securi-
ties, financial markets, and financial institutions. The chapter also described the role of the 
Federal Reserve and discussed the global financial system. In the next chapter, we discuss the 
finance function of a business including the role of the financial managers, financial plan-
ning, asset management, and sources of short- and long-term funds.
Outline the structure and importance of the financial 
system.
The financial system is the process by which funds are 
transferred between those having excess funds (savers) and 
those needing additional funds (users). Savers and users 
are individuals, businesses, and governments. Savers expect 
to earn a rate of return in exchange for the use of their 
funds. Financial markets, financial institutions, and finan-
cial instruments (securities) make up the financial system. 
Although direct transfers are possible, most funds flow from 
savers to users through the financial markets or financial 
institutions, such as commercial banks. A well-functioning 
financial system is critical to the overall health of a nation’s 
economy.

List the various types of securities.
Securities, also called financial instruments, represent obliga-
tions on the part of issuers—businesses and governments—
to provide purchasers with expected or stated returns on the 
funds invested or loaned. Securities can be classified into 
three categories: money market instruments, bonds, and 
stock. Money market instruments and bonds are debt instru-
ments. Money market instruments are short-term debt secu-
rities and tend to be low-risk securities. Bonds are longer-
term debt securities and pay a fixed amount of interest each 
year. Bonds are sold by the U.S. Department of the Treasury 
(government bonds), state and local governments (municipal 
bonds), and corporations. Mortgage pass-through securities 
are bonds backed by a pool of mortgage loans. Most munici-
pal and corporate bonds have risk ratings. Common stock 
represents ownership in corporations. Common stockholders 
have voting rights and a residual claim on the firm’s assets.

Define financial market, and distinguish between primary 
and secondary financial markets.
A financial market is a market where securities are bought 
and sold. The primary market for securities serves businesses 
and governments that want to sell new security issues to 
raise funds. Securities are sold in the primary market either 
through an open auction or via a process called underwrit-
ing. The secondary market handles transactions of previously 
issued securities between investors. The New York Stock 
Exchange is a secondary market. The business or govern-
ment that issued the security is not directly involved in sec-
ondary market transactions. In terms of the dollar value of 
trading volume, the secondary market is about four to five 
times larger than the primary market.

resent the future stock markets.

4.1 What are the world’s two largest stock markets? 
The world’s two largest stock markets are the New York 
Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market.
4.2 Why is the London Stock Exchange unique? The 
London Stock Exchange is probably the most international 
of the world’s stock markets because a large percentage of 
the shares traded are not those of British firms.
4.3 Explain the difference between a market order 
and a limit order. A market order instructs the investor’s 
broker to obtain the best possible price when buying or sell-
ing securities. A limit order sets a maximum price (if the 
investor wants to buy) or a minimum price (if the investor 
wants to sell).
Discuss the organization and functioning of financial 
institutions.
Financial institutions act as intermediaries between sav-
ers and users of funds. Depository institutions—com-
mercial banks, savings banks, and credit unions—accept 
deposits from customers that can be redeemed on demand. 
Commercial banks are the largest and most important of the 
depository institutions and offer the widest range of serv-
ices. Savings banks are a major source of home mortgage 
loans. Credit unions are not-for-profit institutions offer-
ing financial services to consumers. Government agencies, 
most notably the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
insure deposits at these institutions. Nondepository insti-
tutions include pension funds and insurance companies. 
Nondepository institutions invest a large portion of their 
funds in stocks, bonds, and real estate. Mutual funds are 
another important financial institution. These companies sell 
shares to investors and, in turn, invest the proceeds in secu-
rities. Many individuals today invest a large portion of their 
retirement savings in mutual fund shares.
Assessment Check Answers 
5.1 What are the two main types of financial institu-
tions? The two major types of financial institutions are 
depository institutions (those that accept checking and simi-
lar accounts) and nondepository institutions.
5.2 What are the primary differences between 
commercial banks and savings banks? Today commercial 
and savings banks offer many of the same services. 
However, commercial banks lend money to businesses as 
well as to individuals. Savings banks lend money primarily 
to individuals, principally in the form of home 
mortgage loans.
5.3 What is a mutual fund? A mutual fund is an interme-
diary that raises money by selling shares to investors. It then 
pools investor funds and purchases securities that are consis-
tent with the fund’s objectives.
Explain the functions of the Federal Reserve System and 
the tools it uses to control the supply of money and credit.
The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the 
United States. The Federal Reserve regulates banks, per-
forms banking functions for the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury, and acts as the bankers’ bank (clearing checks, 
lending money to banks, and replacing worn-out currency). 
It controls the supply of credit and money in the economy 
to promote growth and control inflation. The Federal 
Reserve’s tools include reserve requirements, the discount

loans. Selective credit controls and purchases and sales of 
foreign currencies also help the Federal Reserve manage the 
economy.

6.1 What is the Federal Reserve System? The Federal 
Reserve System is the U.S. central bank. It is responsible for 
regulating banks, providing banking-related services for the 
federal government, acting as the banker’s bank, and setting 
monetary policy.
6.2 How is the Fed organized? The country is divided 
into 12 districts, each of which has a Federal Reserve Bank. 
The Fed is run by a seven-member board of governors 
headed by a chair and vice chair. An important part of the 
Fed is the Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets 
monetary and interest rate policy. The Fed is designed to be 
politically independent.
6.3 List the four tools the Fed uses to control the 
supply of money and credit. The four tools are reserve 
requirements, the discount rate, open market operations, 
and term auction facility loans.
Evaluate the major features of regulations and laws 
affecting the financial system.
Commercial banks, savings banks, and credit unions in the 
United States are heavily regulated by federal or state bank-
ing authorities. Banking regulators require institutions to 
follow sound banking practices and have the power to close 
noncompliant ones. In the United States, financial markets 
are regulated at both the federal and state levels. Markets 
are also heavily self-regulated by the financial markets and 
professional organizations. The chief regulatory body is the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. It sets the require-
ments for both primary and secondary market activity, pro-
hibiting a number of practices, including insider trading. 
The SEC also requires public companies to disclose finan-
cial information regularly. Professional organizations and 
the securities markets also have rules and procedures that all 
members must follow.
Assessment Check Answers 
7.1 Who regulates banks? All banks have either state or 
federal charters. Federally chartered banks are regulated by 
the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Comptroller of the 
Currency. State-chartered banks are regulated by state bank-
ing authorities and the FDIC.
7.2 Define insider trading. Insider trading is defined as the 
use of material nonpublic information to make an invest-
ment profit.
7.3 List two ways in which the securities markets are 
self-regulated. Professional organizations such as the 
National Association of Securities Dealers have codes of 
conduct that members are expected to follow. Major finan-
cial markets have trading rules and procedures to identify 
suspicious trading activity.
Describe the global financial system.
Financial markets exist throughout the world and are 
increasingly interconnected. Investors in other countries 
purchase U.S. securities, and U.S. investors purchase foreign 
securities. Large U.S. banks and other financial institutions 
have a global presence. They accept deposits, make loans, 
and have branches throughout the world. Foreign banks also 
operate worldwide. The average European or Japanese bank 
is much larger than the average American bank. Virtually 
all nations have central banks that perform the same roles 
as the U.S. Federal Reserve System. Central bankers often 
act together, raising and lowering interest rates as economic 
conditions warrant.
Assessment Check Answers 
8.1 Where do U.S. banks rank compared with interna-
tional banks? Banks in Asia and Europe are generally much 
larger than U.S. banks. In fact, only 3 out of the world’s 30 
largest banks are based in the United States.
8.2 Do other countries have organizations that play 
roles similar to those played by the Federal Reserve? 
Yes, virtually all nations have central banks that perform 
many of the same functions that the U.S. Federal Reserve 
System does.

CASE 1.2
Case 16.1
Emerging-Market Stocks: The New Leaders?
With the emergence of electronic trading, even a 
world-spanning transaction needs only the click of a 
mouse to take place. But this interconnected market also 
has its dark side, because almost all the nations of the 
world were affected by the financial crisis. Many of the 
developed nations struggled to recover, but some develop-
ing nations were more fortunate. Many of them did not 
participate in what turned out to be the housing market 
bubble and were relatively unaffected when it burst. Now 
the economies of nations in Asia and Latin America, as 
well as the oil-rich Russia and the former Soviet-bloc coun-
tries of eastern Europe, could very well move ahead of 
their counterparts.
Emerging markets—financial markets in developing 
nations—are not new. They have been around since the 
19th century. Traditionally, developing nations provided 
raw materials, such as petroleum and other resources, to 
the industrialized West but imported relatively few goods 
in return. Until a few years ago, these nations’ markets 
were best known for the extremes of their boom-and-bust 
cycles. As recently as 1997, many East Asian countries fell 
like dominoes under a series of bankruptcies, recessions, 
and other financial woes. In 1998, Russia defaulted on its 
debt, causing its market to tumble more than 80 percent. 
But since then, many developing countries have managed 
to balance their budgets and have improved in other ways 
that made their economies grow. This growth has brought 
prosperity. Low interest rates on loans have enabled local 
companies to prosper. These countries also have less 
national, corporate, and household debt than most devel-
oped nations do. People can afford to spend money on 
imported goods—and are ready and willing to invest in 
their own countries. 
The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) 
Emerging Markets Index measures the performance of 
financial markets in 25 developing countries. They range 
from Egypt and the Czech Republic to Peru and Thailand, 
as well as Brazil, Russia, India, and China—also known as 
the BRIC countries. Recently, the MSCI Emerging Markets 
Index had grown 70 percent, in a single year.
Antoine Van Agtmael, the chairman and chief invest-
ment officer of Emerging Markets Management, coined 
the term emerging markets. He believes that after the crash of 
2008 and the revival of 2009, “We have just had the best 
gains in the history of emerging markets, we need a bit of 
a breather. It’s not going to be the panic of 2008 and it’s 
not going to be the fabulous year we had last year.”
Some investors warn that emerging markets also 
have a dark side. Perhaps best known to Americans for 
its palm-tree-shaped artificial islands, the small Middle 
Eastern country of Dubai spent lavishly on these and other 
fanciful construction projects and then fell heavily into 
debt. When it failed to attract buyers or even renters for 
these sites, Dubai’s bubble economy burst and the coun-
try fell into a recession. Some investors also worry that 
housing bubbles like the one in the United States may be 
growing in China and Hong Kong. 
But other investors, such as David Cohen of Action 
Economics in Singapore, are more hopeful. Cohen said, 
“The economic picture is brightening despite all the cau-
tion flagged by the central banks and finance ministry 
officials around the world. The data still continues [sic] to 
show a global recovery led by Asia.”
So far, emerging markets account for less than 3 per-
cent of assets managed by American investment firms. But 
if these markets continue to do well, that number could 
double over the next five years.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Suppose one or more developing nations falls 
into a recession. What effect might this have on 
world markets?
2. Why do you think Americans have invested 
so little in emerging markets? If you wanted 
to convince a friend to invest in an emerging 
market with you, what arguments would 
you use?

Part 6  Managing Financial Resources
Like the rest of the United States, mostly rural Meigs 
County, Tennessee, had suffered during the recent finan-
cial crisis and the recession that followed. As the three 
largest employers in the county heard many times, it was 
a bad year to try to start a credit union. But the Middle 
Tennessee Federal Credit Union, now worth $3 million, 
recently celebrated its first birthday. 
The founders of the credit union, originally named 
the Mid East Tennessee Community Credit Union, had 
begun seeking a charter before the economic trouble. 
Their employees were resorting to predatory, high-interest 
payday loans to meet their financial needs, and the found-
ers wanted to help them get small, short-term loans 
on more reasonable terms. The credit union opened for 
business in the midst of the recession. Jim Pitt, the chair-
man of the credit union’s board and the CEO of Polyform 
Plastics, says, “Mostly I am proudest of our loans for the 
first year.” 
Whereas a bank is a for-profit institution beholden 
to its board members and shareholders, a credit union 
is a nonprofit cooperative owned by its members. Credit 
unions emphasize the basic finances of everyday life: sav-
ings and checking accounts, credit cards, and relatively 
small loans for homes or cars. Credit unions generally pay 
more interest on savings accounts and charge less inter-
est on loans. Mark Wolff of the Credit Union National 
Association (CUNA) says, “The credit union channels any 
excess funds back to its members.” Just as the FDIC does 
for banks, the federal government’s National Credit Union 
Administration insures deposits of up to $250,000. 
Credit unions are chartered to serve particular groups. 
Originally, most were affiliated with employers. For exam-
ple, BECU (formerly the Boeing Employees’ Credit Union) 
in Seattle once accepted only employees and their families. 
About ten years ago, credit unions began to ease their 
membership requirements. To join the Middle Tennessee 
Federal Credit Union, a person must simply either work, 
worship, live, or go to school in the local area. 
With the big banks pulling or tightening consumer 
credit, consumers have had trouble getting even the 
most routine loans, for example, for a used car. Small-
business owners have also suffered as banks have cut 
back. Credit unions have filled the gap. Around the coun-
try, credit unions now have 92 million members and have 
grown rapidly. In Michigan alone, they gained 59,000 new 
members in one year. Claudia York, the interim president 
and CEO of Chief Financial Federal Credit Union in Pontiac, 
Michigan, says, “We’ve been getting many more inquiries 
about [business loans]. We have not tightened up at 
all—we have money to loan. We’re trying to be as 
generous as possible while still adhering to our [lending] 
guidelines.”
Credit unions don’t perform all the services of tradi-
tional banks, however. Only 59 percent of credit unions 
issue ATM cards. Those cards are usually part of a network 
of ATM machines at, for example, 7-Eleven, Walgreens, 
Costco, or even banks. Only 22 percent of credit unions 
have safe-deposit boxes. And most credit unions have only 
one branch, or even none. 
Both the CUNA and NCUA Web sites have online 
tools to help you find a credit union near you. Allan 
McMorris, the president and CEO of Michigan’s Oakland 
County Credit Union, said, “I’m very proud of the fact that 
in this tough economy, we are going to set a record in the 
number of loans disbursed. And of course, that’s all local 
money on deposit and local loans. In our local economy, 
we think we’re helping with the recovery.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Why is an organization such as the Credit Union 
National Association important to the credit 
union industry?
2. Use either the CUNA or the NCUA credit 
union locator tool to find a credit union near 
you. If you are eligible to join, compare the 
credit union with your current bank. What are 
the advantages to joining the credit union? 
What are the advantages to staying with 
your bank?

Case 16.2

Chapter 16  The Financial System
New Harvest Coffee Goes Beyond Fair Trade
CASE 1.3
Case 16.3
“Fair Trade has always been part of my legacy in 
coffee,” says RikKleinfeldt, president and co-founder 
of Rhode Island-based New Harvest Coffee Roasters. 
“That’s where I started with New Harvest.” But in less 
than a decade, New Harvest’s business model has evolved 
beyond Fair Trade to something different.
New Harvest is a small-batch coffee roaster specializing 
in certified organic coffee that is grown and harvested by 
farms with sustainable practices. RikKleinfeldt notes that he 
built his company on two pillars: 1) the highest quality cof-
fee, and 2) sustainable sourcing practices. “But these two 
weren’t really gelling at first,” he admits. At the beginning, 
Kleinfeldt tried to source from Fair Trade cooperatives, but 
this wasn’t really fulfilling his objective. “Fair Trade is based 
on the commodity system,” Kleinfeldt explains, “which 
creates a floor price at which coffee can’t drop below. But 
it doesn’t really address the issue of quality.” The groups 
that work with Fair Trade are large cooperatives, sometimes 
encompassing several thousand small farms. All the coffee 
is blended together as a commodity, so it is impossible for 
a roaster like New Harvest to deal directly with each farm, 
selecting the specific harvest that it wants to buy.
Kleinfeldt is quick to point out that when Fair Trade 
began around a decade ago, it was a lifeline to small 
farmers because coffee prices were at an all-time low—
these growers were selling their crops for less than it cost 
to produce them. Without Fair Trade, many of these farms 
would have gone out of business. With the coffee market 
somewhat stabilized though, commodity pricing brings its 
own set of problems. “The commodity pricing usually has 
nothing to do with the coffee itself,” says Kleinfeldt. Prices 
are set at the New York Stock Exchange, not in the grow-
ing fields of Costa Rica or Colombia. He notes that roast-
ers, retailers, and consumers may end up paying way too 
much or way too little for a particular year’s crop.
So Kleinfeldt has become part of what he calls the 
Artisan Coffee movement—growers, roasters, and retailers 
who prefer to deal directly with each other as individual 
businesses. “We connect directly with our growers and 
determine price based on quality,” he explains. Kleinfeldt 
and his staff, along with some of his retailers such as the 
owner of Blue State Coffee and the owner of Pejamajo 
Café, travel to the farms in Costa Rica and Colombia 
where they actually taste the coffee before purchasing a 
crop. Kleinfeldt believes this is the only way to get the 
best coffee on the market. These visits help develop strong 
relationships, find solutions to problems, and develop 
strategies for surviving and thriving as businesses. Through 
visiting, he says, “we can understand their challenges.” 
One farm in particular is located in Colombia. The farmer 
decided he didn’t want to participate in a large Fair Trade 
cooperative—instead, he wanted to develop a market 
for his own coffee. So he approached New Harvest with 
the idea, and the match was ideal. He is now one of New 
Harvest’s premier growers.
Sourcing the coffee beans directly from individual 
farms also helps New Harvest keep close track of organic 
and sustainability practices. GerraHarrigan, director of 
business development for New Harvest Coffee Roasters, 
notes that this is an important part of the firm’s business. 
The owners of local coffee shops—and their customers—
like the reassurance that New Harvest stands behind all of 
its claims. Harrigan takes the hands-on approach. “When 
we deal direct-trade coffee, the coffee has to be cared for 
a little more,” she explains. Harrigan grades the coffee on 
several factors before pricing it for New Harvest.
Kleinfeldt wants consumers to know they are getting 
a great deal when they ask for New Harvest at their local 
shop. He points out that the price differentiation isn’t as 
much as people might think. A visit to the supermarket 
reveals that Starbucks and Green Mountain sell for about 
$9 to $11 per pound, whereas most New Harvest coffee 
sells for about $11 to $13 a pound. Because of the rich-
ness of New Harvest, most customers actually get more 
cups of coffee from a pound of New Harvest than they do 
from the other premium brands.
Kleinfeldt hopes that the Artisan Coffee movement, 
as he refers to his company’s practices, will flourish and 
grow. He believes that if you’re going to drink a cup 
of coffee, it should be really fresh and of the highest 
quality—with beans preferably roasted by New Harvest.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. What are the benefits and drawbacks of treating 
coffee as a commodity in the marketplace? What 
do you predict will be the future of Fair Trade?
2. Should the entire coffee market be regulated in 
any way? Why or why not? If so, how?
3. How would New Harvest change as a business if 
it made an initial public offering (IPO)?
4. What is your opinion of the so-called Artisan 
Coffee movement as a business model? Do you 
think it will be successful in the long run? Why 
or why not?

The Wooing of Ratiopharm
 N early all Americans know that it’s cheaper 
to buy a generic drug—even an over-the-counter 
one such as ibuprofen—than the name-brand 
version, such as Aleve or Advil. Pharmaceutical 
companies know this too. U.S. patents on name-
brand drugs expire after 20 years; once a patent 
runs out, a drug company loses the exclusive right 
to manufacture the name-brand version of the 
product it has spent time, research, and money 
to develop. As the pharmaceutical industry has 
grown and as patents have expired, generic-drug 
companies have sprung up all over the world, from 
Germany to India. Developing a successful new 
drug can pay off handsomely, but it is a risky and 
expensive process, and success is never guaranteed. 
Therefore, many big pharmaceutical companies have 
diversified by buying manufacturers of generics. In 
one recent case, several suitors for a generics maker 
became involved in a classic courtship. In a modern, 
electronic twist, that courtship was concluded in less 
than three months.
Ratiopharm, based in Ulm, Germany, is one of the 
world’s five largest generics producers. It specializes 
in drugs that treat cardiovascular and respiratory 
disorders, diseases of the central nervous system, 
and other illnesses, as well as in medicines that 
prevent infections. When the family that owned 
Ratiopharm announced that it was putting the 
company up for sale, several big pharmaceutical 
firms expressed interest. Eventually that list 
narrowed down to three: Pfizer Inc., based in New 
York City; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries of Israel; 
and Actavis of Iceland.
Among Ratiopharm’s attractions was the fact 
that Germans buy more generic drugs than other 
Europeans, and Ratiopharm is the second biggest 
seller of generics in Germany. Like suitors wooing a 
potential bride, the companies sent their executives 
to Ulm in early March to explain why Ratiopharm 
should accept their offer. Some analysts reported 
that Ratiopharm’s decision would hinge on which 
company promised to preserve the greatest number 
of jobs at Ratiopharm.
Pfizer or its subsidiaries manufacture over-the-
counter brands from Advil and ChapStick to Centrum 
vitamins and Robitussin; prescription drugs for 
women’s health, cardiovascular disease, and cancer; 
and veterinary medicines. One analyst suggested 
that buying Ratiopharm would give Pfizer the 
opportunity to move its brand-name products into 
the worldwide generic market when their patents 
expire. It would also allow Pfizer to expand into 
developing markets. Pfizer’s bid for Ratiopharm 
was 3 billion euros (about $4.08 billion). After 
Pfizer’s presentation, Ratiopharm’s management 
wrote a letter to the company’s employees, saying, 
“The bidder emphasised the high efficiency of 
Ratiopharm’s domestic and foreign production 
sites and told the meeting it was ready to make 
investments in Ulm.”
Teva was already the world’s largest producer of 
generic pharmaceuticals. Acquiring Ratiopharm 
would make Teva the leading generics maker 
in Europe and the second biggest in Germany. 
According to one analyst, Teva aimed to preserve 
both Ratiopharm’s workforce and its locations in 
Germany. Teva offered 3.63 billion euros ($4.97 
billion).
The Icelandic company Actavis had about 10,000 
employees in 40 countries, making it about the same 
size as Ratiopharm. It also had about the same sales 
figures as Ratiopharm. Despite being heavily in debt, 
Actavis made an offer of about 3.32 billion euros, or 
$4.10 billion.
Analysts had predicted that Ratiopharm would not 
make a decision quickly, but Teva soon announced 
it would acquire Ratiopharm for 3.63 billion euros 
($4.97 billion). Shlomo Yani, Teva’s president 
and CEO, announced that Ratiopharm would 
strengthen Teva’s presence “in key European 
markets, most notably in Germany, as well as 
rapidly growing generic markets such as Spain, 
Italy and France.”1

Overview

Previous chapters discuss two essential 
functions that a business must perform. 
First, the company must produce a good 
or service or contract with suppliers to 
produce it. Second, the firm must market 
its good or service to prospective custom-
ers. This chapter introduces a third, equally 
important, function: a company’s manag-
ers must ensure that it has enough money 
to perform its other tasks successfully, in 
both the present and the future, and that 
these funds are invested properly. Adequate 
funds must be available to buy materials, 
equipment, and other assets; pay bills; and 
compensate employees. This third business 
function is finance—planning, obtaining, 
and managing the company’s funds in order 
to accomplish its objectives as effectively and 
efficiently as possible.
An organization’s financial objectives 
include not only meeting expenses and 
investing in assets but also maximizing its 
overall worth, often determined by the 
value of the firm’s common stock. Financial 
managers are responsible for meeting 
expenses, investing in assets, and increas-
ing profits to shareholders. Solid financial 
management is critical to the success of 
a business. A glance through the daily 
news provides examples of firms that, even 
though they offered good products to the 
marketplace, failed because funds were not 
managed properly.
This chapter focuses on the finance 
function of organizations. It begins by 
describing the role of financial managers, 
their place in the organizational hierarchy, 
and the increasing importance of finance. 
Next, the financial planning process and 
the components of a financial plan are out-
lined. Then the discussion focuses on how 
organizations manage assets as efficiently 
and effectively as possible. The two major 
sources of funds—debt and equity—are then 
compared, and the concept of leverage is 
introduced. The major sources of short-term 
and long-term funding are described in the 
following sections. A description of mergers, 
acquisitions, buyouts, and divestitures con-
cludes the chapter.

How does Finance differ 
from Accounting? 
The Role of the Financial Manager
Because of the intense pressures they face today, organizations are increasingly measur-
ing and reducing the costs of business operations, as well as maximizing revenues and profits. 
As a result, financial managers—executives who develop and implement their firm’s finan-
cial plan and determine the most appropriate sources and uses of funds—are among the most 
vital people on the corporate payroll.
Figure 17.1 shows what the finance function of a typical company might look like. At 
the top is the chief financial officer (CFO). The CFO usually reports directly to the compa-
ny’s chief executive officer (CEO) or chief operating officer (COO). In some companies, the 
CFO is also a member of the board of directors. In the case of the software maker Oracle,

both the current CFO and the former CFO serve on that company’s board, the latter as 
its chairman. Moreover, it’s not uncommon for CFOs to serve as independent directors on 
other firms’ boards, such as Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, and Target. As noted in Chapter 
15, the CFO, along with the firm’s CEO, must certify the accuracy of the firm’s financial 
statements.
Reporting directly to the CFO are often three senior managers. Although titles can 
vary, these three executives are commonly called the vice president for financial management 
(or planning), the treasurer, and the controller. The vice president for financial management 
or planning is responsible for preparing financial forecasts and analyzing major investment 
decisions, such as new products, new production facilities, and acquisi-
tions. The treasurer is responsible for all of the company’s financing 
activities, including cash management, tax planning and preparation, and 
shareholder relations. The treasurer also works on the sale of new 
security issues to investors. The controller is the chief accounting man-
ager. The controller’s functions include keeping the company’s books, 
preparing financial statements, and conducting internal audits. The “Hit 
& Miss” feature explains the increasing importance of financially sound 
IT management.
The growing importance of financial professionals is reflected in the 
growing number of CEOs who have been promoted from financial posi-
tions. Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, and Jim Marsh, CEO of the British 
telecommunications company Cable and Wireless, both served as their 
firm’s CFO prior to assuming the top job. The importance of finance 
professionals is also reflected in how much CFOs earn today. According 
to a survey by the executive compensation consulting firm Equilar, the 
median annual salary for CFOs of Fortune 500 companies is around $3.76 
million.2 The CFO of the investment firm Berkshire Hathaway is actually 
paid more than the company’s famous chairman, Warren Buffett.3
In performing their jobs, financial professionals continually seek to 
balance risks with expected financial returns. Risk is the uncertainty of 
gain or loss; return is the gain or loss that results from an investment 
over a specified period of time. Financial managers strive to maximize 
the wealth of their firm’s shareholders by striking the optimal balance 
between risk and return. This balance is called the risk-return trade-off. 
For example, relying heavily on borrowed funds may increase the return

With the growth of software as a service (SaaS), many compa-
nies are making the transition to cloud computing to save money and 
increase efficiency. But is cloud computing really more economical 
and efficient in all cases? Until recently, there hasn’t been a reliable 
way to find out.
Apptio, located in Bellevue, Washington, provides hosted 
Internet technology solutions, among them its Technology Business 
Management package. Recently, Apptio introduced its new Cost 
Transparency Template. This template generates the formulas neces-
sary for a company to calculate how much more—or less—it would 
cost to invest in cloud computing as opposed to other options, includ-
ing traditional in-house hardware and storage. Among Apptio’s clients 
are BNP Paribas, Starbucks, Hallmark, and Expedia. Jeff Day, Apptio’s 
director of marketing, says, “We see that cloud computing is going to 
change the way IT leaders think about how they manage IT.” 
St. Luke’s Health System of Kansas City has 1,200 doctors 
among 9,000 total employees in 11 hospitals. The chief information 
officer, Debe Gash, wanted to eliminate nonessential IT-related costs. 
A spending-analytics tool from Apptio allowed Gash and her team 
to save millions of dollars by highlighting unnecessary or redundant 
spending. For example, St. Luke’s had too many desktop software 
licenses, two full-time employees dealt only with spam management, 
and they were spending a lot of money on electronic storage. Those 
expenses were reduced or eliminated, and funds are being redirected 
instead to finance such needed programs as electronic health records. 
“We were surprised at the efficiencies we were able to derive from 
getting those insights,” Gash said. 
In the future, IT managers will need to understand how the 
cloud works and whether it will actually be more cost effective than 
other in-house or external systems. Day says, “The greatest inhibitor 
of the cloud is a lack of understanding. IT leaders need better sys-
tems and tools to perform accurate analysis.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Why have companies recently become so concerned with 
cost management?
2. Why might it be difficult for very large companies to keep 
accurate account of spending on such items as computer 
hardware and software licenses?

Hit 
(in the form of cash) to shareholders, but the more money a firm borrows, the greater the 
risks to shareholders. An increase in a firm’s cash on hand reduces the risk of being unable 
to meet unexpected cash needs. However, because cash in and of itself does not earn much, 
if any, return, failure to invest surplus funds in an income-earning asset—such as in securi-
ties—reduces a firm’s potential return or profitability. Many illustrations of the risk-return 
trade-off are provided throughout this chapter.
Every financial manager must perform this risk-return balancing act. For example, in 
the late 1990s, Airbus wrestled with a major decision: whether to begin development and 
production of the giant A380 jetliner. The development costs for the aircraft—the world’s 
largest jetliner—were initially estimated at more than $10 billion. Before committing to such 
a huge investment, financial managers had to weigh the potential profits of the A380 with 
the risk that the profits would not materialize. With its future on the line, Airbus decided to 
go ahead with the development of the A380, spending more than $15 billion on research and 
development. The A380 entered commercial service a few years ago. Airbus currently has 
orders for approximately 200 jetliners at a list price of more than $359 million each.4 At this 
time, however, it’s still unclear whether the A380 investment will turn out to be a smart, and 
profitable, decision.
Financial managers must also learn to adapt to changes in the financial system. The 
recent credit crisis has made it more difficult for some companies to borrow money from 
traditional lenders such as banks. This, in turn, has forced firms to scale back expansion 
plans or seek funding from other sources such as commercial financing companies. In addi-
tion, financial managers must adapt to internal changes as well.

Financial Planning
Financial managers develop their organization’s financial plan, a document that speci-
fies the funds needed by a firm for a given period of time, the timing of inflows and out-
flows, and the most appropriate sources and uses of funds. Some financial plans, often called 
operating plans, are short-term in nature, focusing on projections no more than a year or two 
in the future. Other financial plans, sometimes referred to as strategic plans, have a much lon-
ger time horizon, perhaps up to five or ten years.
Regardless of the time period, a financial plan is based on forecasts of production costs, 
purchasing needs, plant and equipment expenditures, and expected sales activities for the 
period covered. Financial managers use forecasts to determine the specific amounts and tim-
ing of expenditures and receipts. They build a financial plan based on the answers to three 
questions:
1. What funds will the firm require during the planning period?
2. When will it need additional funds?
3. Where will it obtain the necessary funds?
Some funds flow into the firm when it sells its goods or services, but funding needs 
vary. The financial plan must reflect both the amounts and timing of inflows and outflows 
of funds. Even a profitable firm may face a financial squeeze as a result of its need for funds 
when sales lag, when the volume of its credit sales increases, or when customers are slow in 
making payments.
In general, preparing a financial plan consists of three steps. The first is a forecast of 
sales or revenue over some future time period. This projection is, in fact, the key variable 
in any financial plan because without an accurate sales forecast, the firm will have difficulty 
accurately estimating other variables, such as production costs and purchasing needs. The 
best method of forecasting sales depends on the nature of the business. For instance, a 
retailer’s CFO might begin with the current sales-per-store figure. Then he or she would 
look toward the near future, factoring in expected same-store sales growth, along with any 
planned store openings or closings, to come up with a forecast of sales for the next period. 
If the company sells merchandise through other channels, such as online, the forecast is 
adjusted to reflect those additional channels.
Next, the CFO uses the sales forecast to determine the expected level of profits for 
future periods. This longer-term projection involves estimating expenses such as purchases, 
employee compensation, and taxes. Many expenses are themselves functions of sales. For 
instance, the more a firm sells, generally the greater its purchases. Along with estimating 
future profits, the CFO should also determine what portion of these profits will likely be 
paid to shareholders in the form of cash dividends.
After coming up with the sales and profit forecast, the CFO then needs to estimate 
how many additional assets the firm will need to support projected sales. Increased sales, 
for example, might mean the company needs additional inventory, stepped-up collections 
for accounts receivable, or even new plant and equipment. Depending on the nature of the 
industry, some businesses need more assets than do other companies to support the same 
amount of sales. The technical term for this requirement is asset intensity. For instance, the 
chemical manufacturer DuPont has approximately $0.68 in assets for every dollar in sales.

So, for every $100 increase in sales, the firm would need 
about $68 of additional assets. The warehouse retailer 
Costco, by contrast, has only roughly $0.34 in assets for every 
dollar in sales. It would require an additional $34 of assets for 
every $100 of additional sales. This difference is not surpris-
ing; manufacturing is a more asset-intensive business than 
retailing.
A simplified financial plan illustrates these steps. Assume 
a growing company is forecasting that sales next year will 
increase by $40 million to $140 million. After estimating 
expenses, the CFO believes that after-tax profits next year 
will be $12 million and the firm will pay nothing in divi-
dends. The projected increase in sales next year will require 
the firm to invest another $20 million in assets, and because 
increases in assets are uses of funds, the company will need 
an additional $20 million in funds. The company’s after-tax 
earnings will contribute $12 million, meaning that the other $8 million must come from 
outside sources. So the financial plan tells the CFO how much money will be needed and 
when it will be needed. Armed with this knowledge, and given that the firm has decided 
to borrow the needed funds, the CFO can then begin negotiations with banks and other 
lenders.
The cash inflows and outflows of a business are similar to those of a household. The 
members of a household depend on weekly or monthly paychecks for funds, but their expen-
ditures vary greatly from one pay period to the next. The financial plan should indicate when 
the flows of funds entering and leaving the organization will occur and in what amounts. 
One of the most significant business expenses is employee compensation. 
A good financial plan also includes financial control, a process of comparing actual revenues, 
costs, and expenses with forecasts. This comparison may reveal significant differences between 
projected and actual figures, so it is important to discover them early to take quick action.
Bill Morrison is the CFO of Pittsburgh-based Genco Marketplace, which liquidates, or 
sells off, other companies’ excess inventory. Genco buys inventory that is not selling well 
then resells it to wholesalers. In turn, the wholesalers sell the inventory to discount retail-
ers. Always vigilant about the cost of freight, including fuel, Genco pays the transportation 
costs of taking the goods from their current location to where they will be liquidated. Some 
excess inventory is seasonal. When a retailer has winter coats left over in June, Genco will 
buy those coats, hold them in inventory, and sell them to a wholesaler in the fall, when 
demand rises again. But the longer a product remains unsold, the harder it will be to liqui-
date, even at a deep discount. In all cases, Morrison or members of his team have to prepare 
a financial plan that takes into account not only the benefits of buying the merchandise but 
the risks as well.5
Managing Assets
As we noted in Chapter 15, assets consist of what a firm owns. But assets also repre-
sent uses of funds. To grow and prosper, companies need to obtain additional assets. Sound 
financial management requires assets to be acquired and managed as effectively and effi-
ciently as possible. The “Business Etiquette” feature offers tips for managing assets.

Tips for Managing Assets
These are challenging times for all businesses, whether one-person start-ups 
or large corporations. One of the most difﬁ cult problems is controlling costs. 
Here are some tips on managing assets—physical, ﬁ nancial, and human—
while focusing on both short-term demands and long-term planning:
1 
Deﬁ ne your goals and objectives. Be realistic in working out what resources you 
need to meet your immediate needs and what you will need to fulﬁ ll your 
long-term plans. If you need to borrow money, be aware that currently, 
credit is very tight.
2 
Examine your expenses. You may ﬁ nd some areas—such as travel or dis-
cretionary spending—where you can reduce or eliminate unnecessary 
expenditures. Which makes more ﬁ nancial sense for your company, 
traditional hardware and storage or cloud computing?
3 Communicate with all your associates. Be sure that your employees, suppliers, 
and clients know what is happening with your business. Often when 
people hear nothing, especially during difﬁ cult times, they will assume 
the worst has happened.
4 
Cultivate your human assets. Identify your valued employees and let them know 
that they are important. In difﬁ cult times, competing companies often try 
to lure away talented personnel. Constant communication is important 
here too. If your best employees hear nothing from you, they, too, will 
assume the worst has happened—and they will be more willing to leave 
for what seem to be better opportunities elsewhere.
5 
Have at least one backup plan. Your goals and objectives may not work out 
the way you would like them to. You may plan for a certain amount of 
receivables, but what if they suddenly drop off? If possible, have sufﬁ cient 
ﬁ nancial reserves available to meet the unexpected. That way, you may be 
able to turn even disaster to your advantage.

Short-Term Assets
Short-term, or current, assets consist of cash 
and assets that can be, or are expected to be, con-
verted into cash within a year. The major current 
assets are cash, marketable securities, accounts 
receivable, and inventory.
Cash and Marketable Securities 
The major purpose of cash is to pay day-to-day 
expenses, much as when individuals maintain bal-
ances in checking accounts to pay bills or buy 
food and clothing. In addition, most organizations 
strive to maintain a minimum cash balance in 
order to have funds available in the event of unex-
pected expenses. As noted earlier, because cash 
earns little, if any, return, most firms invest excess 
cash in so-called marketable securities—low-risk 
securities that either have short maturities or can 
be easily sold in secondary markets. Money market 
instruments—described in Chapter 16—are popu-
lar choices for firms with excess cash. The cash 
budget, which we discussed in Chapter 15, is one 
tool for managing cash and marketable securities 
because it shows expected cash inflows and out-
flows for a period of time. The cash budget indi-
cates months when the firm will have surplus cash 
and can invest in marketable securities and months 
when it will need additional cash.
Critics of some companies’ budgeting prac-
tices contend that occasionally firms hoard cash. 
Recently, Cisco Systems had more than $35 bil-
lion in cash and marketable securities. Yet firms 
may have good reasons for holding large amounts 
of cash and marketable securities. They may 
plan on using these funds shortly to make a large 
investment, pay dividends to shareholders, or 
repurchase outstanding bonds.
Accounts Receivable Accounts receiv-
able are uncollected credit sales and can be a signifi-
cant asset. The financial manager’s job is to collect 
the funds owed the firm as quickly as possible while 
still offering sufficient credit to customers to gener-
ate increased sales. In general, a more liberal credit 
policy means higher sales but also increased col-
lection expenses, higher levels of bad debt, and a 
higher investment in accounts receivable.
Management of accounts receivable is com-
posed of two functions: determining an overall

574
credit policy and deciding which customers will be 
offered credit. Formulating a credit policy involves deciding 
whether the firm will offer credit and, if so, on what terms. 
Will a discount be offered to customers who pay in cash? 
Often, the overall credit policy is dictated by competitive 
pressures or general industry practices. If all your competi-
tors offer customers credit, your firm will likely have to as 
well. The other aspect of a credit policy is deciding which 
customers will be offered credit. Managers must consider 
the importance of the customer as well as its financial 
health and repayment history.
One simple tool for assessing how well receivables are 
being managed is calculating accounts receivable turnover 
over successive time periods. We showed how this ratio 
is calculated in Chapter 15. If receivables turnover shows 
signs of slowing, it means that the average credit customer 
is paying later. This trend warrants further investigation.
Inventory Management For many firms, such 
as retailers, inventory represents the largest single asset. At 
the home furnishings retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, inven-
tory makes up about 49 percent of total assets. Even for 
nonretailers, inventory is an important asset. At the heavy-
equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, inventory is almost 12 
percent of total assets. On the other hand, some types of 
firms, such as electric utilities and transportation compa-
nies, have no inventory. For the majority of firms, which do 
carry inventory, proper management of it is vital.
Managing inventory can be complicated. The cost of 
inventory includes more than just the acquisition cost. It also 
includes the cost of ordering, storing, insuring, and financ-
ing inventory, as well as the cost of stockouts, lost sales due 
to insufficient inventory. Financial managers try to minimize 
the cost of inventory. But production, marketing, and logistics also play important roles in 
determining proper inventory levels. The production considerations of inventory manage-
ment were discussed in Chapter 10. In Chapter 12, we outlined the marketing and logistics 
issues surrounding inventory.
Trends in the inventory turnover ratio—described in Chapter 15—can be early warning 
signs of impending trouble. For instance, if inventory turnover has been slowing for several 
consecutive quarters, it indicates that inventory is rising faster than sales. In turn, this may 
suggest that customer demand is softening and the firm needs to take action, such as reduc-
ing production or increasing promotional efforts.
Capital Investment Analysis
In addition to current assets, firms also invest in long-lived assets. Unlike current assets, 
long-lived assets are expected to produce economic benefits for more than one year. These 
investments often involve substantial amounts of money. For example, as noted earlier in 
the chapter, Airbus invested more than $15 billion in development of the A380. In another

At Bed Bath & Beyond, inventory is the most valuable asset. Managing 
inventory can be a costly and highly complicated undertaking, especially 
for retailers.

example, in 2009 the auto manufacturer BMW recently spent $750 million on expanding its 
production facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina, bringing its total investment in the state 
to $4.6 billion.6
The process by which decisions are made regarding investments in long-lived assets is 
called capital investment analysis. Firms make two basic types of capital investment decisions: 
expansion and replacement. The A380 and the BMW South Carolina plant investments are 
examples of expansion decisions. Replacement decisions involve upgrading assets by sub-
stituting new ones. A retailer, such as Walmart, might decide to replace an old store with a 
new Supercenter, as it did in Oxford, Ohio.
Financial managers must estimate all of the costs and benefits of a proposed invest-
ment, which can be quite difficult, especially for very long-lived investments. Only those 
investments that offer an acceptable return—measured by the difference between benefits 
and costs—should be undertaken. BMW’s financial managers believed that the benefits of 
expanding the South Carolina production facility outweighed the high cost. The expansion 
will allow BMW to produce three new models designed mainly for the North American 
market, so the expected profit from the sale of these models would be considered in the 
decision. Some other benefits cited by BMW include lower production costs and improved 
logistics. The Spartanburg facility recently produced its 1.5 millionth vehicle. In a ceremony 
marking that milestone, Josef Kerscher, president of BMW [U.S.] Manufacturing, noted, 
“Today’s events represent a significant milestone for BMW, emphasizing both BMW’s com-
mitment to the U.S. market and its confidence in the future.”7
Managing International Assets
Today, firms often have assets worldwide. Both McDonald’s and The Coca-Cola 
Company generate more than half of their annual sales outside the United States. The 
vast majority of sales for Unilever and Nestlé occur outside their home countries (the 
Netherlands and Switzerland, respectively). Managing international assets creates several 
challenges for the financial manager, one of the most important of which is the problem of 
exchange rates.
As we discussed in several other chapters, an exchange rate is the rate at which one cur-
rency can be exchanged for another. Exchange rates can vary substantially from year to year, 
creating a problem for any company with international assets. As an example, assume a U.S. 
firm has a major subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Assume that the U.K. subsidiary earns 
an annual profit of £750 million (stated in British pounds). Over the past five years, the 
exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound has varied between 1.82 (dollars 
per pound) and 1.56.8 This means the dollar value of the U.K. profits ranged from $1.37 bil-
lion to $1.17 billion.
Consequently, many global firms engage in activities that reduce the risks associated 
with exchange rate fluctuations. Some are quite complicated. However, one of the simplest 
and most widely used is called a balance sheet hedge. Essentially, a balance sheet hedge cre-
ates an offsetting liability to the non-dollar-denominated asset, one that is denominated in 
the same currency as the asset. In our example, the U.K. subsidiary is a pound-denominated 
asset. To create an offsetting liability, the firm could take out a loan, denominated in British 
pounds, creating a pound-denominated liability. If done correctly, this hedge will reduce 
or even eliminate the risk associated with changes in the value of the dollar relative to the

Sources of Funds 
and Capital Structure
The use of debt for financing can increase the potential for return as well as increase loss 
potential. Recall the accounting equation introduced in Chapter 15:
Assets  Liabilities  Owners’ equity
If you view this equation from a financial management perspective, it reveals that 
there are only two types of funding: debt and equity. Debt capital consists of funds obtained 
through borrowing. Equity capital consists of funds provided by the firm’s owners when they 
reinvest earnings, make additional contributions, liquidate assets, issue stock to the general 
public, or raise capital from outside investors. The mix of a firm’s debt and equity capital is 
known as its capital structure. 
Companies often take very different approaches to choosing a capital structure. As more 
debt is used, the risk to the company increases since the firm is now obligated to make the 
interest payments on the money borrowed, regardless of the cash flows coming into the com-
pany. Choosing more debt increases the fixed costs a company must pay, which in turn makes 
a company more sensitive to changing sales revenues. Debt is frequently the least costly 
method of raising additional financing dollars, one of the rea-
sons it is so frequently used.
Differing industries choose varying amounts of debt 
and equity to use when financing. Using the information 
provided by DataMonitor, the automotive industry has debt 
ratios (the ratio of liabilities to assets) of over 60 percent 
for both Toyota and Honda and over 90 percent for Ford. 
These companies are primarily using debt to finance their 
asset expenditures. Companies like the profit foodservice 
companies of McDonald’s and Starbucks use only 49 percent 
debt and 27 percent debt, respectively. The mixture of debt 
and equity a company uses is a major management decision.
Leverage and Capital Structure 
Decisions
Raising needed cash by borrowing allows a firm to ben-
efit from the principle of leverage, increasing the rate of 
return on funds invested by borrowing funds. The key to 
managing leverage is to ensure that a company’s earnings 
remain larger than its interest payments, which increases the 
leverage on the rate of return on shareholders’ investment. Of 
course, if the company earns less than its interest payments, 
shareholders lose money on their original investments.

shareholder returns for two identical hypothetical firms that 
choose to raise funds in different ways. Leverage Company

While the country was suffering through the financial crisis and 
its aftermath, the news media were filled with reports of astronomical 
salaries of CEOs and other top executives at large corporations.
At a recent Royal Dutch Shell annual meeting, shareholders voted 
down the proprosed executive compensation package. In response to 
this reprimand, the company announced that it would freeze executive 
pay and base its bonuses on performance. The new CEO received a 
salary 20 percent lower than that of the previous CEO. The company 
said that the changes would “demonstrate appropriate restraint in the 
current economic environment. “Say-for-pay” voting by shareholders 
has become increasingly common—and controversial.
Should company shareholders help determine how 
much top executives are paid?
Summary
A financial-regulation reform bill recently cleared a joint congressional committee and is schedule for a 
vote by the full Congress. One of its provisions gives shareholders the right to a nonbinding vote on execu-
tive pay.

PRO
1. Publicly held corporations are owned by their sharehold-
ers, who should have the opportunity to vote on compensation for 
top executives. Robert E. Denham and Rajiv L. Gupta, co-chairs of 
The Conference Board Task Force on Executive Compensation, said, 
“Shareholders . . . and the public deserve to see executive compensa-
tion programs that serve shareholders’ interests and are explained to 
shareholders. . . .”
2. Some analysts believe that lopsided pay structures had a part 
in the financial crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said, 
“Compensation practices at some banking organizations have led to 
misaligned incentives and excessive risk-taking. . . .” 
CON
1. Shareholders may not necessarily know what appropriate pay 
is. Many don’t have the time or resources to do their own analysis and 
judge whether a pay program is suitable—or whether it promotes a 
risk-taking, get-rich-quick mentality in executives.
2. Shareholders recently turned down the chance to vote on execu-
tive pay at companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Dow Chemical. 
Many prefer to discuss pay structures with management and board 
members before voting.

company bonds. Leverage Company pays 10 percent interest on its bonds. Equity Company 
raises all of its funds through sales of company stock.
Notice that if earnings double, from, say, $10 million to $20 million, returns to share-
holders of Equity Company also double—from 10 percent to 20 percent. But returns to 
shareholders of Leverage Company more than double—from 10 percent to 30 percent. 
However, leverage works in the opposite direction as well. If earnings fall from $10 million 
to $5 million, a decline of 50 percent, returns to shareholders of Equity Company also 
fall by 50 percent—from 10 percent to 5 percent. By contrast, returns to shareholders of 

Part 6  Managing Financial Resources
578
Leverage Company fall from 10 percent to zero. Thus, leverage increases potential returns 
to shareholders but also increases risk.
Another problem with borrowing money is that an overreliance on borrowed funds may 
reduce management’s flexibility in future financing decisions. If a company raises equity capital 
this year and needs to raise funds next year, it will probably be able to raise either debt or equity 
capital. But if it raises debt capital this year, it may be forced to raise equity capital next year.
Equity capital has drawbacks as well. Because shareholders are owners of the company, 
they usually have the right to vote on major company issues and elect the board of direc-
tors. Whenever new equity is sold, the control of existing shareholders is diluted, and the 
outcome of these votes could potentially change. One contentious subject today between 
companies and shareholders is whether shareholders should be able to vote on executive pay 
packages. The “Solving an Ethical Controversy” feature debates this issue.
Another disadvantage of equity capital is that it is more expensive than debt capital. 
First, creditors have a senior claim to the assets of a firm relative to shareholders. Because of 
this advantage, creditors are willing to accept a lower rate of return than shareholders are. 
Second, the firm can deduct interest payments on debt, reducing its taxable income and tax 
bill. Dividends paid to shareholders, on the other hand, are not tax deductible. A key com-
ponent of the financial manager’s job is to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of debt 
capital and equity capital, creating the most appropriate capital structure for his or her firm.
Mixing Short-Term and Long-Term Funds
Another decision financial managers face is determining the appropriate mix of short-
and long-term funds. Short-term funds consist of current liabilities, and long-term funds 
consist of long-term debt and equity. Short-term funds are generally less expen-
sive than long-term funds, but they also expose the firm to more risk. This is 
because short-term funds have to be renewed, or rolled over, frequently. Short-
term interest rates can be volatile. During a recent 12-month period, for exam-
ple, rates on commercial paper, a popular short-term financing option, ranged 
from a high of 6 percent to a low of less than 2 percent.9
Because short-term rates move up and down frequently, interest expense 
on short-term funds can change substantially from year to year. For instance, if 
a firm borrows $50 million for ten years at 5 percent interest, its annual inter-
est expense is fixed at $2.5 million for the entire ten years. On the other hand, 
if it borrows $50 million for one year at a rate of 4 percent, its annual interest 
expense of $2 million is only fixed for that year. If interest rates increase the fol-
lowing year to 6 percent, $1 million will be added to the interest expense bill. 
Another potential risk of relying on short-term funds is availability. Even finan-
cially healthy firms can occasionally find it difficult to borrow money.
Because of the added risk of short-term funding, most firms choose to 
finance all of their long-term assets, and even a portion of their short-term 
assets, with long-term funds. Johnson & Johnson is typical of this choice. 
Figure 17.3 shows a recent balance sheet broken down between short- and 
long-term assets, and short- and long-term funds.

dividend policy. Dividends are periodic cash payments 
to shareholders. The most common type of dividend is 
paid quarterly and is often labeled as a regular dividend. 
Occasionally, firms make one-time special or extra dividend 
payments, as Microsoft did some years ago. Earnings that 
are paid in dividends are not reinvested in the firm and 
don’t contribute additional equity capital.
Firms are under no legal obligation to pay dividends 
to shareholders. Although some companies pay generous 
dividends, others pay nothing. Until 2010, Starbucks never 
paid a dividend to its shareholders. In contrast, 3M has paid 
dividends for 30-plus consecutive years, during which time 
the amount has more than quadrupled. Companies that pay 
dividends try to increase them or at the very least hold them 
steady from year to year. However, in rare cases firms must 
cut or eliminate dividends. As mentioned in Chapter 16, as 
a result of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico BP announced 
they were canceling dividend payments for the first quarter and suspending those payments 
to shareholders for the second and third quarters of their fiscal year.10
Many factors determine a company’s dividend policy, one of which is its investment 
opportunities. If a firm has numerous investment opportunities and wishes to finance some 
or all of them with equity funding, it will likely pay little, if any, of its earnings in dividends. 
Shareholders may actually want the company to retain earnings, because if they are reinvested, 
the firm’s future profits, and the value of its shares, will increase faster. By contrast, a firm 
with more limited investment opportunities generally pays more of its earnings in dividends.
In addition to dividends, some firms buy back a portion of their outstanding stock. 
Home Depot, for instance, has repurchased more than $1 billion of stock over the past few 
years. Generally, shares are purchased on the secondary markets. The main purpose of share 
buy-backs is to raise the market value of the remaining shares, thus benefiting shareholders. 
Short-Term Funding Options
Many times throughout a year, an organization may discover that its cash needs exceed 
its available funds. Retailers generate surplus cash for most of the year, but they need to 
build up inventory during the late summer and fall to get ready for the holiday shopping sea-
son. Consequently, they often need funds to pay for merchandise until holiday sales generate 
revenue. Then they use the incoming funds to repay the amount they borrowed. In these 
instances, financial managers evaluate short-term sources of funds. By definition, short-term 
sources of funds are repaid within one year. Three major sources of short-term funds exist: 
trade credit, short-term loans, and commercial paper. Large firms often rely on a combina-
tion of all three sources of short-term financing.
Trade Credit
Trade credit is extended by suppliers when a firm receives goods or services, agreeing 
to pay for them at a later date. Trade credit is common in many industries such as retailing 
and manufacturing. Suppliers routinely ship billions of dollars of merchandise to retailers

each day and are paid at a later date. Without trade credit, the retailing sector would prob-
ably look much different—with fewer selections. Under this system, the supplier records 
the transactions as an account receivable, and the retailer records it as an account payable. 
Target alone currently has more than $6.5 billion of accounts payable on its books. The 
main advantage of trade credit is its easy availability because credit sales are common in 
many industries. The main drawback to trade credit is that the amount a company can bor-
row is limited to the amount it purchases.
What is the cost of trade credit? If suppliers do not offer a cash discount, trade credit is 
effectively free. For example, assume a supplier offers trade credit under the terms net 30—
meaning that the buyer has 30 days to pay. This is similar to borrowing $100 and repaying 
$100 in 30 days. The effective rate of interest is zero. However, some suppliers offer a dis-
count if they are paid in cash. If a discount is offered, trade credit can get quite expensive. 
Now assume that a 2 percent discount is offered to cash buyers. If they do not take the dis-
count, they have 30 days to pay. Essentially, then, if the buyer doesn’t pay cash, it is borrow-
ing $98 today and repaying $100 30 days from today. The annual interest rate on such a loan 
exceeds 24 percent.
Short-Term Loans
Loans from commercial banks are a significant source of short-term financing for busi-
nesses. Often businesses use these loans to finance inventory and accounts receivable. For 
example, late fall and early winter is the period of highest sales for a small manufacturer of 
ski equipment. To meet this demand, it has to begin building inventory during the summer. 
The manufacturer also has to finance accounts receivable (credit sales to customers) during 
the fall and winter. So it takes out a bank loan during the summer. As the inventory is sold 
and accounts receivable collected, the firm repays the loan.
There are two types of short-term bank loans: lines of credit and revolving credit agree-
ments. A line of credit specifies the maximum amount the firm can borrow over a period of 
time, usually a year. The bank is under no obligation to actually lend the money, however. 
It does so only if funds are available. Most lines of credit require the borrower to repay 
the original amount, plus interest, within one year. By contrast, a revolving credit agree-
ment is essentially a guaranteed line of credit—the bank guarantees that the funds will be 
available when needed. Banks typically charge a fee, on top of interest, for revolving credit 
agreements.
The cash budget is an important tool for determining the size of a line of credit because 
it shows the months when additional financing will be needed or when borrowed funds can 
be repaid. For instance, assume the ski manufacturer’s cash budget indicates that it will need 
$2.5 million for the June through November period. The financial manager might set up a 
line of credit with the bank for $2.8 million. The extra $300,000 is for any unexpected cash 
outflows.
In addition to commercial banks, commercial finance companies also make short-term 
loans to businesses. While most bank loans are unsecured, meaning that no specific assets 
are pledged as collateral, loans from commercial finance companies are often secured with 
accounts receivable or inventory.
Another form of short-term financing using accounts receivable is called factoring. The 
business sells its accounts receivable to either a bank or finance company—called a factor—at 
a discount. The size of the discount determines the cost of the transaction. Factoring allows 
the firm to convert its receivables into cash quickly without worrying about collections.

Chapter 17  Financial Management

The cost of short-term loans depends not only on the interest rate but also on the fees 
charged by the lender. In addition to fees, some lenders require the borrower to keep so-
called compensating balances—5 to 20 percent of the outstanding loan amount—in a check-
ing account. Compensating balances increase the effective cost of a loan since the borrower 
doesn’t have full use of the amount borrowed.
Say, for example, that a firm borrows $100,000 for one year at 5 percent interest. The 
borrower will pay $5,000 in interest (5 percent  $100,000). If the lender requires that 
10 percent of the loan amount be kept as compensating balance, the firm has use of only 
$90,000. However, because it still will pay $5,000 in interest, the effective rate on the loan is 
actually 5.56 percent ($5,000 divided by $90,000).
Commercial Paper
Commercial paper is a short-term IOU sold by a company; this concept was briefly 
described in Chapter 16. Commercial paper is typically sold in multiples of $100,000 to $1 
million and has a maturity that ranges from 1 to 270 days. Most commercial paper is unse-
cured. It is an attractive source of financing because large amounts of money can be raised at 
rates that are typically 1 to 2 percent less that those charged by banks. At the end of a recent 
year, almost $1.15 trillion in commercial paper was outstanding.11 Although commercial 
paper is an attractive short-term financing alternative, only a small percentage of businesses 
can issue it. That is because access to the commercial paper market has traditionally been 
restricted to large, financially strong corporations.
Sources of Long-Term Financing
Funds from short-term sources can help a firm meet current needs for cash or inventory. 
A larger project or plan, however, such as acquiring another company or making a major 
investment in real estate or equipment, usually requires funds for a much longer period of 
time. Unlike short-term sources, long-term sources are repaid over many years.
Organizations acquire long-term funds from three sources. One is long-term loans 
obtained from financial institutions such as commercial banks, life insurance companies, and 
pension funds. A second source is bonds—certificates of indebtedness—sold to investors. A 
third source is equity financing acquired by selling stock in the firm or reinvesting company 
profits.
Public Sale of Stocks and Bonds
Public sales of securities such as stocks and bonds are a major source of funds for 
corporations. Such sales provide cash inflows for the issuing firm and either a share in its 
ownership (for a stock purchaser) or a specified rate of interest and repayment at a stated 
time (for a bond purchaser). Because stock and bond issues of many corporations are traded 
in the secondary markets, stockholders and bondholders can easily sell these securities. 
Recently, when a European debt crisis seemed likely, it caused a massive slowdown in bond 
sales. But as fears of a crisis eased later in the year, bond sales reached their highest level 
since the same time the previous year. As of mid-2010, companies had sold about $307 bil-
lion of U.S. corporate bonds.12 Public sales of securities, however, can vary substantially

from year to year depending on conditions in the financial markets. Bond sales, for instance, 
tend to be higher when interest rates are lower.
In Chapter 16, we discussed the process by which most companies sell securities pub-
licly—through investment bankers via a process called underwriting. Investment bankers pur-
chase the securities from the issuer and then resell them to investors. The issuer pays a fee to 
the investment banker, called an underwriting discount.
Private Placements
Some new stock or bond issues are not sold publicly but instead to a small group of 
major investors such as pension funds and insurance companies. These sales are referred to 
as private placements. Most private placements involve corporate debt issues. More than $120 
billion in corporate bonds were sold privately in a recent year in the United States.13
It is often cheaper for a company to sell a security privately than publicly, and there is 
less government regulation with which to contend because SEC registration is not required. 
Institutional investors such as insurance companies and pension funds buy private place-
ments because they typically carry slightly higher interest rates than publicly issued bonds. In 
addition, the terms of the issue can be tailored to meet the specific needs of both the issuer 
and the institutional investors. Of course, the institutional investor gives up liquidity because 
privately placed securities do not trade in secondary markets.
Venture Capitalists
Venture capitalists are an important source of long-term financing, especially to new 
companies. Venture capitalists raise money from wealthy individuals and institutional 
investors and invest these funds in promising firms. Venture capitalists also provide manage-
ment consulting advice as well as funds. In exchange for their investment, venture capitalists 
become part owners of the business. If the business succeeds, venture capitalists can earn 
substantial profits. The “Going Green” feature describes how Intel has joined with two 
dozen venture capitalist firms to create the “Invest 
in America” alliance to fund research into clean 
technology among other innovations.
One of the largest venture capital firms is 
Draper Fisher Jurvetson, based in Menlo Park, 
California. During the past 20 years, DFJ has 
invested in more than 300 small, start-up compa-
nies including Hotmail (acquired by Microsoft) 
and Skype (acquired by eBay). Currently the firm 
has more than $5.5 billion in capital commitments 
in companies throughout the world.14

Intel Invests in U.S. Technology
Paul Otellini, the CEO of Intel Corporation, the world’s largest chip 
manufacturer, noted that other countries, among them China, India, 
and Taiwan, have overtaken the United States as centers of innovation 
in the technology industry. Concerned that the United States faces fierce 
competition from other countries worldwide, Otellini recently announced 
a new initiative. The “Invest in America Alliance” teams Intel with 17 
technology companies—including Google, Microsoft, Dell, and General 
Electric—and 24 leading venture capital firms. The alliance plans to 
invest $3.5 billion in start-up technology companies in the United States 
over two years. Intel Capital, Intel’s own investment sector, plans to 
invest $200 million. The money will go to businesses in innovative fields 
such as information technology, clean technology, and biotechnology. 
But the fund will also invest in newer industries such as molecular diag-
nostics, electric vehicle ecosystems, and wireless infrastructure.
Among the venture capital firms that have signed on are Advanced 
Technology Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byars, and Draper 
Fisher Jurvetson. Arvind Sodhani, the president of Intel Capital and 
Intel’s executive vice president, said, “Venture capital investments have 
played an important role in creating jobs at home and keeping America 
at the leading edge of technology globally.”
The alliance is also seeking commitments from the technology 
industry to increase their hiring of recent college graduates. Among 
those who have made the pledge are Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, 
Adobe, and Dell. The alliance’s goal is to create a total of about 10,500 
jobs, mostly in computer science and engineering. But jobs will also be 
available in financial planning, marketing, and sales. Intel has promised 
to hire more recent graduates as well. “It would be a long-term mis-
take to let our future scientists and engineers sit idle after graduation,” 
Otellini said.

in both public and privately held companies. Unlike venture capital funds, which tend to 
focus on small, start-up companies, private equity funds invest in all types of businesses, 
including mature ones. For example, Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity fund, 
recently bought the military contractor DynCorp International for about $1.5 billion.15 
Often, private equity funds invest in transactions that take public companies private, or lever-
aged buyouts (LBOs). In these transactions, discussed in more detail in the next section, a 
public company reverts to private status. The “Hit & Miss” feature profiles another large pri-
vate equity fund, Harvest Partners.
A variation of the private equity fund is the so-called sovereign wealth fund. These com-
panies are owned by governments and invest in a variety of financial and real assets, such as 
real estate. Although sovereign wealth funds generally make investments based on the best 
risk-return trade-off, political, social, and strategic considerations also play roles in their 
investment decisions.
Recently, several sovereign wealth funds made large investments in major U.S. financial 
firms, including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. For instance, the Abu Dhabi Investment 
Authority (ADIA) invested in Citigroup, buying $7.5 billion in “equity shares” and becoming 
the giant bank’s largest single shareholder in the process. However, ADIA has filed a claim 
against the bank, charging that Citigroup misled ADIA about its financial health. Citigroup 
called the charges “entirely without merit.” ADIA may lose $4.8 billion when it must convert 
its equity units to shares.16 The assets of the ten largest sovereign wealth funds are shown in 
Figure 17.4. Together, these ten funds have more than $2.3 trillion in assets.

Harvest Partners and other private equity firms have just a few years to 
invest about $500 billion.
Harvest Partners, based in New York City, is a private equity firm 
that specializes in leveraged buyouts and growth financing. It focuses 
on companies in the United States, the rest of North America, and 
western Europe that have well-established sales or operations in the 
United States. The firm manages funds emphasizing private equity and 
debt investments. Harvest Partners makes equity investments of any-
where from $30 million to $100 million in companies whose revenues 
run between $100 million and $750 million. It prefers to be a control 
investor and become a partner in the companies it finances. Those 
companies tend to be middle-market firms that need investment to 
adapt to changing times and markets.
Private equity firms usually have three to six years to reinvest 
funds they have raised from client investors. If they cannot or do not, 
they must return that money. During the boom years, Harvest Partners 
raised $815 million from client investors. So far it has reinvested about 
$293 million. Now the firm is facing a 2012 deadline to reinvest the 
remaining $522 million. 
Not all private equity investments are successful. Harvest Partners 
had owned the equity of the Natural Products Group, a manufac-
turer of organic shampoos and soaps. But when NPG went bankrupt, 
Harvest Partners lost its entire investment.
Recently Harvest Partners joined MTP Energy Management to 
invest $80 million in Regency Energy Partners, a middle-market natural 
gas company. Michael DeFlorio, a senior managing director of Harvest 
Partners, said that Regency “embodies our investment strategy focused 
on exceptionally managed . . . midstream service providers participating 
in the most promising resource plays in the industry.”

Hedge Funds
Hedge funds are private investment companies open only to qualified large investors. 
In recent years, hedge funds have become a significant presence in U.S. financial markets. 
Before the recent recession, some analysts estimated that hedge funds accounted for about 
60 percent of all secondary bond market trading and around one-third of all activity on stock 
exchanges. More recently, hedge fund providers have begun selling these funds, in the form 
of mutual funds, to smaller investors for as little as $1,000.17 They are also significant inves-
tors in noninvestment grade, or junk, bonds. Hedge funds are estimated to have total assets 
that exceed $1.82 trillion.18 Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds are not regulated by the SEC.
Traditionally, hedge funds, unlike venture capitalists and private equity funds, did not 
make direct investments in companies, preferring instead to purchase existing stock and 
bond issues. 
Mergers, Acquisitions, Buyouts, 
and Divestitures
Chapter 5 briefly described mergers and acquisitions. A merger is a transaction in which 
two or more firms combine into one company. In an acquisition, one firm buys the assets 
and assumes the obligations of another firm. Chapter 5 also listed the classifications of merg-
ers and acquisitions—vertical, horizontal, and conglomerate—and noted that many of these 
transactions involve large sums of money. A recent example is Hewlett-Packard’s acquisition 
of the smart phone maker Palm. In this section, we focus on the financial implications of not 
only mergers and acquisitions but also buyouts and divestitures.
Note that even in a merger, there is a buyer and seller. The seller is often referred to as 
the target. Financial managers evaluate a proposed merger or acquisition in much the same 
way they would evaluate any large investment—by comparing the costs and benefits. To 
acquire another company, the buying firm typically has to offer a premium for the target’s 
shares—in other words, a higher price than the current market price. For instance, Hewlett-
Packard offered $5.70 for each share of Palm, a premium of almost 20 percent over the 
existing price.19
When the buyer makes what is known as a tender offer for the target’s shares, it speci-
fies a price and the form of payment. The buyer can offer cash, securities, or a combination 
of the two. The Hewlett-Packard offer to Palm shareholders was all cash. The tender offer 
can be friendly, meaning it is endorsed by the target’s board of directors, or unfriendly. 
Shareholders of both the buyer and target must vote to approve a merger.
Justifying such a premium requires the financial manager also to estimate the benefits 
of a proposed merger. These benefits could take the form of cost savings from economies 
of scale or reduced workforces or the buyer getting a bargain price for the target’s assets. 
Sometimes, a buyer finds that the most cost-effective method of entering a new market is 
simply to buy an existing company that serves the market. Johnson & Johnson has a long 
history of making such acquisitions. When it decided to enter the contact lens market several 
years ago, Johnson & Johnson bought Vistakon, the firm that invented disposable contact 
lenses under the brand name Acuvue. Whatever the reasons, the term used to describe the 
benefits produced by a merger or acquisition is synergy—the notion that the combined firm 
is worth more than the buyer and target are individually.

Leveraged buyouts, or LBOs, were briefly introduced in the preceding section. In an 
LBO, public shareholders are bought out, and the firm reverts to private status. The term 
leverage comes from the fact that many of these transactions are financed with high degrees 
of debt—often in excess of 75 percent. Private equity companies and hedge funds provide 
equity and debt financing for many LBOs. The firm’s incumbent senior management is 
often part of the buyout group. LBO activity decreased sharply with the recent economic 
downturn. As the economy began to recover, LBO activity increased again. According 
to Standard & Poor’s, LBO financing recently grew to $13.6 billion, about 15 times the 
amount from the same time a year before. With more than $500 billion in funds, private 
equity companies and others were looking for acquisitions.20
Why do so many LBOs occur? One reason is that private companies enjoy benefits that 
public companies do not. Private companies are not required to publish financial results, 
are subject to less SEC oversight, and are not pressured to produce the short-term profits 
often demanded by Wall Street. Some argue that LBOs, because of the high degree of debt, 
enforce more discipline on management to control costs. Although LBOs do have advan-
tages, history has shown that many companies that go private reemerge as public companies 
several years later.
In a sense, a divestiture is the reverse of a merger. That is, a company sells assets such 
as subsidiaries, product lines, or production facilities. Two types of divestitures exist: sell-offs 
and spin-offs. In a sell-off, assets are sold by one firm to another. Verizon Wireless, an affili-
ate of Verizon Communications Inc., sold some of its wireless assets to AT&T. AT&T then 
announced plans to roll out its 3G wireless service to about 1.6 million former Verizon sub-
scribers in rural areas across 18 states. 
The other type of divestiture is a spin-off. In this transaction, the assets sold form a 
new firm. Shareholders of the divesting firm become shareholders of the new firm as 
well. For example, Motorola announced that it would split into two publicly traded firms. 
The parent company will handle its core business of mobile converged devices, digital 
home-entertainment devices, and video voice and data solutions. The spin-off firm will 
handle heavy-duty two-way radios, mobile computers, public security systems, wireless 
network infrastructure, and other business-oriented goods and services. Both entities will 
continue to use the Motorola brand name, with the parent company now named Motorola 
Mobile Devices and Home. Motorola shareholders will receive shares of the new company, 
Motorola Enterprise Mobility and Networks.
Firms divest assets for several reasons. Sometimes divestitures result from prior 
acquisitions that didn’t work out as well as expected. In early 2001, America Online and 
Time Warner merged to create AOL Time Warner, Inc. Nine years later, Time Warner 
announced it would spin off AOL. The merger—now considered one of the worst mistakes 
in corporate history—failed to generate the much-heralded synergies between the two com-
panies. Shortly after the merger, AOL had 27 million subscribers; more recently, that num-
ber had shrunk to about 6.3 million. 
In other cases, a firm makes a strategic decision to concentrate on its core businesses 
and decides to divest anything that falls outside this core. That was the explanation that 
Motorola gave in response to criticism that the company had become too large and had seen 
its mobile-device business overtaken first by Nokia, then Samsung, and then Apple. Still 
another explanation relates to antitrust issues. Verizon originally wanted to buy Alltel. The 
U.S. Department of Justice required Verizon to divest itself of assets in markets where Alltel 
was already operating—mainly rural areas in many central states—before it would approve 
the purchase.

lines the main legal issues concerning business. It reviews the types of laws, the regulatory 
environment of business, and the core of business law, including discussions of contract law 
and property law. Appendix B examines risk management and insurance. It describes the 
concept of risk, alternative ways of dealing with risk, and the various kinds of insurance avail-
able to business and individuals. Appendix C discusses some of the important components of 
personal financial planning, such as budgeting, credit, and retirement planning. Appendix D 
describes how to write an effective business plan, and Appendix E discusses career searches

Summary of Learning Goals
Define finance, and explain the role of financial managers.
Finance deals with planning, obtaining, and managing a com-
pany’s funds to accomplish its objectives efficiently and effec-
tively. The major responsibilities of financial managers are 
to develop and implement financial plans and determine the 
most appropriate sources and uses of funds. The chief finan-
cial officer (CFO) heads a firm’s finance organization. Three 
senior executives reporting to the CFO are the vice president 
for financial management, the treasurer, and the controller. 
When making decisions, financial professionals continually 
seek to balance risks with expected financial returns.
Assessment Check Answers 
1.1 What is the structure of the finance function at 
the typical firm? The head of the finance function of a 
firm has the title of chief financial officer (CFO) and gen-
erally reports directly to the firm’s chief executive officer. 
Reporting to the CFO are the treasurer, the controller, and 
the vice president for financial management.
1.2 Explain the risk-return trade-off. Financial managers 
strive to maximize the wealth of their firm’s shareholders by 
striking the optimal balance between risk and return. Often, 
decisions involving the highest potential returns expose the 
firm to the greatest risks.
Describe the components of a financial plan and the finan-
cial planning process.
A financial plan is a document that specifies the funds needed 
by a firm for a given period of time, the timing of inflows and 
outflows, and the most appropriate sources and uses of funds. 
The financial plan addresses three questions: What funds will 
be required during the planning period? When will funds 
be needed? Where will funds be obtained? Three steps are 
involved in the financial planning process: forecasting sales 
over a future period of time, estimating the expected level of 
profits over the planning period, and determining the addi-
tional assets needed to support additional sales.

2.2 Explain the steps involved in preparing a financial 
plan. The first step is to forecast sales over a future period 
of time. Second, the financial manager must estimate the 
expected level of profits over the planning period. The final 
step is to determine the additional assets needed to support 
additional sales.
Outline how organizations manage their assets.
Assets consist of what a firm owns and also represent the 
uses of its funds. Sound financial management requires assets 
to be acquired and managed as effectively and efficiently as 
possible. The major current assets are cash, marketable secu-
rities, accounts receivable, and inventory. The goal of cash 
management is to have sufficient funds on hand to meet day-
to-day transactions and pay any unexpected expenses. Excess 
cash should be invested in marketable securities, which are 
low-risk securities with short maturities. Managing accounts 
receivable, which are uncollected credit sales, involves 
collecting funds owed the firm as quickly as possible while

also offering sufficient credit to customers to generate 
increased sales. The main goal of inventory management is 
to minimize the overall cost of inventory. Production, mar-
keting, and logistics also play roles in determining proper 
inventory levels. Capital investment analysis is the process 
by which financial managers make decisions on long-lived 
assets. This involves comparing the benefits and costs of a 
proposed investment. Managing international assets poses 
additional challenges for the financial manager, including the 
problem of fluctuating exchange rates.
Assessment Check Answers 
3.1 Why do firms often choose to invest excess cash in 
marketable securities? Cash earns no rate of return, which 
is why excess cash should be invested in marketable securi-
ties. These are low-risk securities that have short maturities 
and can be easily sold in the secondary markets. As a result, 
they are easily converted back into cash, when needed.
3.2 What are the two aspects of accounts receivable 
management? The two aspects of accounts receivable man-
agement are deciding on an overall credit policy (whether 
to offer credit and, if so, on what terms) and determining 
which customers will be offered credit.
3.3 Explain the difference between an expansion deci-
sion and a replacement decision. An expansion decision 
involves decisions about offering new products or building 
or acquiring new production facilities. A replacement deci-
sion is one that considers whether to replace an existing 
asset with a new one.
Compare the two major sources of funds for a business, 
and explain the concept of leverage.
Businesses have two sources of funds: debt capital and equity 
capital. Debt capital represents funds obtained through bor-
rowing, and equity capital consists of funds provided by the 
firm’s owners. The mix of debt and equity capital is known as 
the firm’s capital structure, and the financial manager’s job is to 
find the proper mix. Leverage is a technique of increasing the 
rate of return on funds invested by borrowing. However, lever-
age increases risk. Also, overreliance on borrowed funds may 
reduce management’s flexibility in future financing decisions. 
Equity capital also has drawbacks. When additional equity 
capital is sold, the control of existing shareholders is diluted. 
In addition, equity capital is more expensive than debt capital. 
Financial managers are also faced with decisions concerning 
the appropriate mix of short- and long-term funds. Short-term 
funds are generally less expensive than long-term funds but 
expose firms to more risk. Another decision involving financial 
managers is determining the firm’s dividend policy.
Assessment Check Answers 
4.1 Explain the concept of leverage. Leverage is a tech-
nique of increasing the rate of return by borrowing funds. 
But leverage also increases risk.
4.2 Why do firms generally rely more on long-term 
funds rather than short-term funds? Although short-term 
funds are generally less expensive than long-term funds, 
short-term funds expose the firm to additional risks. The 
cost of short-term funds can vary substantially from year to 
year. In addition, at times short-term funds can be difficult 
to obtain.
4.3 What is an important determinant of a firm’s divi-
dend policy? The main determinant of a firm’s dividend 
policy is its investment opportunities. Firms with more prof-
itable investment opportunities often pay less in dividends 
than do firms with fewer such opportunities.
Identify sources of short-term financing for business 
operations.
The three major short-term funding options are trade credit, 
short-term loans from banks and other financial institutions, 
and commercial paper. Trade credit is extended by suppliers 
when a firm receives goods or services, agreeing to pay for 
them at a later date. Trade credit is relatively easy to obtain 
and costs nothing unless a supplier offers a cash discount. 
Loans from commercial banks are a significant source of 
short-term financing and are often used to finance accounts 
receivable and inventory. Loans can be either unsecured or 
secured, with accounts receivable or inventory pledged as 
collateral. Commercial paper is a short-term IOU sold by a 
company. Although large amounts of money can be raised 
through the sale of commercial paper, usually at rates below 
those charged by banks, access to the commercial paper mar-
ket is limited to large, financially strong corporations.

5.1 What are the three sources of short-term funding? 
The three sources of short-term funding are trade credit, 
short-term loans from banks and other financial institutions, 
and commercial paper.
5.2 Explain trade credit. Trade credit is extended by sup-
pliers when a buyer agrees to pay for goods and services at a 
later date. Trade credit is relatively easy to obtain and costs 
nothing unless a cash discount is offered.
5.3 Why is commercial paper an attractive short-term 
financing option? Commercial paper is an attractive financ-
ing option because large amounts can be raised by selling 
commercial paper at rates that are generally lower than 
those charged by banks.
Discuss long-term financing options.
Long-term funds are repaid over many years. There are 
three sources: long-term loans obtained from financial 
institutions, bonds sold to investors, and equity financing. 
Public sales of securities represent a major source of funds 
for corporations. These securities can generally be traded in 
secondary markets. Public sales can vary substantially from

year to year depending on the conditions in the financial 
markets. Private placements are securities sold to a small 
number of institutional investors. Most private placements 
involve debt securities. Venture capitalists are an important 
source of financing for new companies. If the business suc-
ceeds, venture capitalists stand to earn large profits. Private 
equity funds are investment companies that raise funds from 
wealthy individuals and institutional investors and use the 
funds to make investments in both public and private com-
panies. Unlike venture capitalists, private equity funds invest 
in all types of businesses. Sovereign wealth funds are invest-
ment companies owned by governments.

6.1 What is the most common type of security sold pri-
vately? Corporate debt securities are the most common type 
of security sold privately.
6.2 Explain venture capital. Venture capitalists are impor-
tant sources of funding, especially for new companies. 
Venture capitalists invest in these companies by taking an 
ownership position. If the business succeeds, venture capital-
ists can earn substantial profits.
6.3 What is a sovereign wealth fund? A sovereign wealth 
fund is a government-owned investment company. These 
companies make investments in a variety of financial and 
real assets, such as real estate. Although most investments 
are based on the best risk-return trade-off, political, social, 
and strategic considerations play roles as well.
Describe mergers, acquisitions, buyouts, and divestitures.
A merger is a combination of two or more firms into one 
company. An acquisition is a transaction in which one 
company buys another. Even in a merger, there is a buyer 
and a seller (called the target). The buyer offers cash, securi-
ties, or a combination of the two in return for the target’s 
shares. Mergers and acquisitions should be evaluated as any 
large investment is, by comparing the costs with the benefits. 
Synergy is the term used to describe the benefits a merger 
or acquisition is expected to produce. A leveraged buyout 
(LBO) is a transaction in which shares are purchased from 
public shareholders, and the company reverts to private sta-
tus. Usually LBOs are financed with substantial amounts of 
borrowed funds. Private equity companies are often major 
financers of LBOs. Divestitures are the opposite of mergers, 
in which companies sell assets such as subsidiaries, product 
lines, or production facilities. A sell-off is a divestiture in 
which assets are sold to another firm. In a spin-off, a new 
firm is created from the assets divested. Shareholders of the 
divesting firm become shareholders of the new firm as well.

7.1 Define synergy. Synergy is the term used to describe 
the benefits produced by a merger or acquisition. It is the 
notion that the combined firm is worth more than the buyer 
and the target are individually.
7.2 What is an LBO? An LBO—a leveraged buyout—is a 
transaction whereby public shareholders are bought out, and 
the firm reverts to private status. LBOs are usually financed 
with large amounts of borrowed money.
7.3 What are the two types of divestitures? A sell-off 
is a divestiture in which assets are sold to another firm. In 
a spin-off, a new firm is created from the assets divested.

Part 6  Managing Financial Resources
1. Assume you would like to start a business. Put together a 
rough financial plan that addresses the three financial plan-
ning questions listed in the text.
2. Working with a partner, assume that a firm needs $10 mil-
lion in additional long-term capital. It currently has no debt 
and $40 million in equity. The options are issuing a ten-year 
bond (with an interest rate of 7 percent) or selling $10 mil-
lion in new equity. You expect next year’s earnings before 
interest and taxes to be $5 million. (The firm’s tax rate is 35 
percent.) Prepare a memo outlining the advantages and dis-
advantages of debt and equity financing. Using the numbers 
provided, prepare a numerical illustration of leverage similar 
to the one shown in Figure 17.2. 
3. Your new small business has really grown, but now it needs 
a substantial infusion of capital. A venture capital firm has 
agreed to invest the money you need. In return, the venture 
capital firm will own 75 percent of the business, and you will 
be replaced as CEO by someone chosen by the venture capi-
talist. You will retain the titles of founder and chairman of 
the board. Would you be willing to take the money but lose 
control over your business? Why or why not?
4. Working in a small team, select three publicly traded compa-
nies. Visit each firm’s Web site. Most have a section devoted 
to information for investors. Review each firm’s dividend 
policy. Does the company pay dividends? If so, when did it 
begin paying dividends? Have dividends increased each year, 
or have they fluctuated from year to year? Is the company 
currently repurchasing shares? Has it done so in the past? 
Prepare a report summarizing your findings.

Case 17.1
ConocoPhillips Divests to Return to Its Core
ConocoPhillips, with headquarters in Houston, Texas, 
is the third largest American oil company. It has nearly 
30,000 employees in offices in 30 countries around the 
world. But for two years running, Conoco did poorly in 
the New York Stock Exchange, with its shares losing 40 
percent of their value. Conoco more than doubled its debt 
when it bought Burlington Resources Inc., a natural-gas 
producer, for $36 billion. At the end of a recent year, 
Conoco’s debt was three times that of the largest U.S. 
oil company, ExxonMobil, even though ExxonMobil was 
almost twice Conoco’s size in terms of revenue. How could 
Conoco turn itself around?

Chapter 17  Financial Management
At its annual analyst meeting, the company 
announced plans to enhance its value to its shareholders 
by increasing dividends by 10 percent and buying back 
some shares of its stock. Another goal is to raise $10 bil-
lion by 2012. 
ConocoPhillips will raise these funds through divesti-
ture, selling off some of its noncore assets. The company 
said that these assets did not fit well strategically with 
its core operations, they had high operation costs, and 
they were marketable. The company acknowledged that it 
would lose from 80,000 to 120,000 barrels of oil produc-
tion per day and 400 to 600 million barrels of oil equiva-
lent in reserve. But it hoped to emerge leaner and stron-
ger, with a renewed focus on core projects that would 
bring in a higher return on investment.
Jim Mulva, the chairman and CEO, said, “We are 
focused on creating and delivering value to our sharehold-
ers. We are taking decisive action to sell assets, reduce 
debt, build on our record of shareholder distributions, and 
improve returns while growing production and reserves per 
share,”
Some analysts believed that Conoco’s first priority 
was to sell its 9 percent stake in Syncrude, which one 
analyst referred to as one of Conoco’s “crown jewels.” 
Syncrude Canada Ltd. is located in the province of Alberta, 
just north of Montana, and is the world’s largest producer 
of synthetic crude oil from oil sand deposits. Conoco 
recently announced that it sold its share in Syncrude to 
China’s Sinopec for $4.65 billion, pending approval by 
the Chinese and Canadian governments. Mulva declared, 
“[W]e are pleased that [Sinopec] has recognized the value 
of this quality asset.”
Another of Conoco’s noncore assets was its 20 per-
cent share in Lukoil, Russia’s biggest oil producer. Conoco 
had invested heavily in Lukoil in hopes of large profits on 
some joint projects with Lukoil, but those profits had never 
materialized. This was in part because of strict Russian 
regulations concerning foreign companies in important 
industries. Lukoil’s CEO, Vagit Alekperov, commented, 
“Initially, we were aiming for a large package of joint 
projects, but it turned out to be rather narrow, which 
probably also disappointed [Conoco].” At first, Conoco 
hoped Lukoil would buy back half of its stake, but Lukoil 
turned that offer down. Conoco then offered those shares 
for sale on the open market, keeping a 10 percent share 
in Lukoil. Conoco hopes to earn about $5 billion from that 
sale and use those funds to repurchase some of its stock 
from shareholders.
Conoco’s 25 percent share in the Rockies Express 
Pipeline is another of the company’s “crown jewels.” This 
high-speed, natural-gas pipeline runs almost 1,700 miles 
from northwestern Colorado to eastern Ohio. Conoco has 
offered its stake in the Rockies Express Pipeline for sale. 
Will ConocoPhillips achieve its goal of raising $10 billion 
by 2012? Time will tell.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Why is it important for ConocoPhillips to 
increase the value of its shares for its investors?
2. Research ConocoPhillips. How close has it come 
to raising the desired $10 billion?

Top Hedge Fund Managers Earn Record Paychecks
Case 17.2
Along with the rest of the banking and investment 
industry, hedge fund managers experienced steep drops in 
income during the recent recession. But as the economy 
began to revive, the 25 top-earning hedge fund managers 
earned $25.3 billion. That figure shattered even the old 
record, set in the boom days before the crisis. 

592
Part 6  Managing Financial Resources
One of those managers was David Tepper of 
Appaloosa Management. Other investors feared that the 
banking sector would collapse again, but Tepper bet that 
the federal government would step in to prevent the big-
gest banks from failing. In late 2008 and early 2009, he 
invested heavily in preferred shares and bonds of the big 
banks, among other seemingly losing prospects. Tepper, 
formerly of Goldman Sachs, won big, earning $4 billion. 
“We bet on the country’s revival,” he said. “Those who 
keep their heads while others are panicking do well.” The 
U.S. Treasury Department apparently agreed with him, 
because it also bought preferred stock in troubled banks 
to help shore them up. The Treasury has since sold many 
of those stocks at a handsome profit. 
Hedge funds are elite, private investment companies 
that are open only to highly qualified, large investors. 
Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds are not regulated by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. During the heady days 
before the financial crisis, hedge funds earned huge profits. 
Their managers did well, too, because they usually take a 
significant percentage of a hedge fund’s annual earnings. 
When the crisis struck, even these funds experienced losses 
in the double digits, and their managers saw their income 
drop by as much as 50 percent. But when the market ral-
lied, hedge funds resurged as well. Of the 25 top hedge 
fund managers, the lowest earner made $350 million. 
As the United States and the rest of the world econo-
mies recovered, the news media reported the immense sal-
aries of CEOs and other top corporate executives at banks 
and large brokerage houses. The stories stirred the critics, 
especially because ordinary people were losing their jobs, 
homes, and health insurance. But some analysts believe 
that hedge fund managers such as David Tepper earned 
their huge salaries because they dared to take big risks in 
the hope of big rewards. 
Of course, not all hedge funds did well when the stock 
market revived. The gap between the highest-earning hedge 
funds and the losing ones grew wider. Nadia Papagiannis, 
a hedge fund analyst at Morningstar Inc., said, “The hedge 
funds that survived 2008 were able to capture the gains on 
the way up in 2009. This year is not going to be as lucrative 
as last year. There’s not enough of room [sic] for another rally 
as big as we saw in ‘09.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Compare hedge funds with mutual funds. 
2. Do you agree that the top hedge fund manag-
ers deserve their high salaries? Why or why not?

Comet Skateboards Rides the Triple Bottom Line
CASE 1.3
Case 17.3
Jason Salfi, co-founder and president of Comet 
Skateboards, is the first to admit he can let the wheels get 
away from him. Since the inception of Comet Skateboards, 
he estimates that he has personally “tanked the company 
four times. I started the company with a friend and we 
would sacrifice everything for quality,” Salfi admits. It’s 
easy to see how this could happen. Salfi loves skateboard-
ing and he’s a fanatic about building the best skate-
boards on the market with the most sustainable materials 
available.
During the first years of production—when Comet 
moved from California to Ithaca, New York in order to 
source bio-composite materials—Salfi and his partner paid 
top dollar for all the materials they used in building the 
boards. “We weren’t really watching how much money 
we were making,” Salfi says sheepishly. They were so 
wrapped up in the excitement of developing and manu-
facturing an entirely new class of skateboard, they forgot 
to watch the bank account balance.Salfi recalls that they 
did all the stereotypical things that small start-ups do to 
obtain financing—maxed out their credit cards, got friends 
and family to co-sign for loans, found angel investors. But 
Comet Skateboards just seemed to roll through the money 
without enough return to ensure its survival.
Then the firm hired a manager to specialize in finan-
cial details. With a professional in place, Salfi began to 
understand the real and potential impacts certain buying 
decisions would have on the bottom line, and the way 
cash flow would affect getting products to the market-
place. Now, Comet can forecast better how a product 

593
Chapter 17  Financial Management
release will affect cash flow, and how that in turn will 
affect the way they as a business can reach customers. 
“Ultimately we’re trying to create a sustainable business 
platform to get our sustainable business vision out there in 
the marketplace,” explains Salfi. But they couldn’t do this 
without managing the company’s financial resources.
Comet Skateboards is considered a triple bottom line 
company, carrying the B Corporation logo. This means that 
Comet strives to create benefit for the company owners 
(profit), the community (people), and the environment 
(planet). Currently there are more than two hundred B 
Corporations in thirty industries around the nation. Each 
company has submitted to rigorous evaluation and has 
put written standards in place addressing social and 
environmental responsibility. Everything that Comet 
does, from its closed-loop manufacturing process to its 
community involvement, refers to its triple bottom line 
commitment.
Jason Salfi insists that managing the finances for a 
triple bottom line company is pretty much the same as 
managing the finances for a traditional company. But 
there are some differences, particularly in the procurement 
of raw materials, energy use, and waste disposal. Also, 
triple bottom line companies are held accountable for the 
way they treat employees and how they are involved in 
the community. “The ‘magic’ is making sure we can afford 
all that,” observes Salfi. “It’s just a matter of prioritization. 
We’re not going on $50,000 golf retreats. We’re reinvest-
ing the capital we have in the materials we use and the 
way we interact with people.”
Despite the fact that he says he didn’t pay attention 
to finances in the company’s early days, Salfi has a good 
grasp on Comet’s role in the larger economic picture. 
He likes the idea of projecting the impact Comet has on 
consumers’ buying decisions, particularly young people. 
Teenagers who choose Comet skateboards are choosing 
products that are made by a triple bottom line firm. “If 
you look at the way a 14-year-old decides to buy things 
for the rest of his or her life, and you look at the number 
of decisions that young person is going to make over 
the span of 50 or 60 years, you could extrapolate that 
we have impacted 1,000 people in a certain way that 
could eventually transfer billions of dollars toward socially 
responsible businesses,” explains Salfi. “We’re influencing 
the buying decisions of youth.”
Salfi believes that, decades ago, “commerce used 
to be about improving the quality of life, but somewhere 
along the line, profits skewed motivations.” He likes the 
idea of the triple bottom line rebalancing the priorities of 
business. “We like to think that as a B Corporation, we 
are part of a group that wants to bring back the original 
motivation for business, which was all about creating 
an improved quality of life for everyone, not just a select 
few.” It might actually be possible for a few well-engi-
neered skateboards to change the world.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Hiring a financial manager was a major step for 
Comet Skateboards. Identify some of the factors 
the manager would have to consider when cre-
ating a plan for risk-return trade-off.
2. What might be some short-term funding 
options for Comet? Some long-term options? 
Which would be best for this company, and 
why?
3. Suppose a larger firm approached Comet with 
an offer of acquisition. Create a chart outlining 
the major pros and cons of such an offer.
4. How might Comet’s designation as a B 
Corporation affect the way it answers the three 
essential questions for building a financial plan?

Part 6  Managing Financial Resources
When Dan Wallach started Greensburg GreenTown, 
he knew it wouldn’t be easy. A self-proclaimed idea guy, he 
admits that the details of high finance elude him. What he is 
good at is rallying people around a cause and getting them to 
write a few big checks. This time, though, Wallach decided 
to involve the largest number of people possible. Greensburg 
GreenTown’s One Million $5.00 Donations campaign was 
the result. 
The money that is raised will be used to cover 
GreenTown’s operating expenses, as well as to fund gaps in 
municipal projects, build model green homes, and educate 
residents about green building practices. Another aspect of 
GreenTown’s work is to provide information and access to 
media organizations. Shortly after the tornado, the Planet 
Green cable channel began production on a television series 
that would chronicle the town’s rebuilding. Wallach thought 
the exposure created by that show and others like it would be 
valuable in his fund-raising efforts. 
As a not-for-profit organization, Greensburg 
GreenTown is heavily regulated by the IRS, because the 
donations it receives are fully tax deductible. It falls into the 
same category as religious organizations and educational 
institutions, which are exempt from federal income taxes 
but must pay other federal taxes, such as employment taxes. 
Because working through the red tape required to obtain this 
IRS status can take time, many organizations, GreenTown 
included, work through an approved intermediary while their 
applications are processed.
Although Greensburg GreenTown supports and edu-
cates Greensburg’s residents, the town itself must rely on 
other sources of funding. All towns have budgets for repairs 
and improvements, but no one expected to have to rebuild 
the entire town. After the tornado, Greensburg had no roads, 
no hospital, no school system, no utilities, or any of the other 
services one might expect to find in a town. Money was tight 
even before the tornado, so rebuilding seemed an impossible 
task.
Luckily, various government and corporate organizations 
chipped in. The Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
provided aid in the form of grants. Corporations like Frito-
Lay donated significant amounts of money to support the 
town’s innovative business incubator. With millions of dol-
lars at stake and hundreds of projects under way at once, 
Assistant Town Administrator and Recovery Coordinator 
Kim Alderfer says the hardest part is keeping track of it all.
Questions
After viewing the video, answer the following questions:
1. What are the key legal and financial distinctions of 
Greensburg GreenTown?
2. If you were in Kim Alderfer’s shoes, what kind of 
financial contingency plan would you put in place for 
Greensburg’s future?
3. Should not-for-profit organizations be required to open 
their books to donors? Why or why not?

Finance Career
Part 6, “Managing Financial 
Resources,” describes the finance 
function in organizations. Finance 
deals with planning, obtaining, and 
managing an organization’s funds to 
accomplish its objectives in the most 
effective way possible. In Chapter 
16, we discussed the financial system, 
including the various types of securi-
ties, financial markets and institutions, 
the Federal Reserve System, financial 
regulators, and global financial mar-
kets. In Chapter 17, we examined 
the role financial managers play 
in an organization; financial plan-
ning; short- and long-term financing 
options; and mergers, acquisitions, 
buyouts, and divestitures. Throughout 
both chapters, we described the 
finance functions of a variety of 
businesses, governments, and not-
for-profit organizations. As Part 6 
illustrates, finance is a very diverse 
profession and encompasses many 
different occupations. According 
to the U.S. Department of Labor, 
over the next decade most finance-
related occupations are expected to 
experience employment growth that 
is a little better than average for all 
occupations. However, employment 
in several finance occupations is 
expected to grow faster than aver-
age. Employment in the financial 
investment industry should be strong 
because of the number of Baby 
Boomers in their peak earning years 
with funds to invest and the globaliza-
tion of securities markets.1
In most business schools, finance 
is one of the most popular majors 
among undergraduates. Combining 
finance with accounting is a common 
double major. Those with degrees in 
finance also enjoy relatively high start-
ing salaries. A recent survey found that 
the average starting salary for a per-
son with an undergraduate degree in 
finance was nearly $50,500 per year.2
All organizations need to obtain 
and manage funds, so they employ 
finance professionals. Financial insti-
tutions and other financial services 
firms employ a large percentage of 
finance graduates. These businesses 
provide important finance-related ser-
vices to businesses, governments, and 
not-for-profit organizations. Some 
graduates with finance degrees take 
jobs with financial services firms such 
as Bank of America and JP Morgan 
Chase, while others begin their 
careers working in the finance depart-
ments of businesses in other industries 
such as 3M and Boeing, governments, 
or not-for-profit organizations. You 
may begin your career evaluating 
commercial loan applications for a 
bank, analyzing capital investments 
for a business, or helping a not-for-
profit organization decide how to 
invest its endowment. Often finance 
professionals work as members of 
a team, advising top management. 
Some individuals spend their entire 
careers working in finance-related 
occupations; others use their finance 
experience to move into other areas 
of the firm. Today, the chief financial 
officer—the senior finance execu-
tive—holds one of the most critical 
jobs in any organization. In addition, 
the number of CEOs who began their 
careers in finance is growing.
Finance is a diverse, exciting pro-
fession. Here are a few of the specific 
occupations you might find after earn-
ing a degree in finance.
Financial managers prepare finan-
cial reports, direct investment activi-
ties, raise funds, and implement cash 
management strategies. Computer 
technology has significantly reduced 
the time needed to produce financial 
reports. Many financial managers 
spend less time preparing reports and 
more time analyzing financial data. All 
organizations employ financial man-
agers, although roughly 30 percent of 
all financial managers work for finan-
cial services firms such as commercial 
banks and insurance companies.3 
Specific responsibilities vary with 
titles. For instance, credit managers 
oversee the firm’s issuance of credit, 
establish standards, and monitor the 
collection of accounts. Cash managers 
control the flow of cash receipts and 
disbursements to meet the needs of 
the organization.
Most loan officers work for com-
mercial banks and other financial 
institutions. They find potential cli-
ents and help them apply for loans. 
Loan officers typically specialize in 
commercial, consumer, or mortgage 
loans. In many cases, loan officers act 
in a sales capacity, contacting indi-
viduals and organizations about their 
need for funds and trying to persuade 
them to borrow the funds from the 
loan officer’s institution. Thus, loan 
officers often need marketing as well 
as finance skills.
Security analysts generally work for 
financial services firms such as Fidelity 

596
Part 6  Managing Financial Resources
or Raymond James & Associates. 
Security analysts review economic 
data, financial statements, and other 
information to determine the outlook 
for securities such as common stocks 
and bonds. They make investment 
recommendations to individual and 
institutional investors. Many senior 
security analysts hold a chartered 
financial analyst (CFA) designation. 
Obtaining a CFA requires a specific 
educational background, several years 
of related experience, and a passing 
grade on a comprehensive, three-stage 
examination.
Portfolio managers manage money 
for an individual or institutional client. 
Many portfolio managers work for pen-
sion funds or mutual funds for which 
they make investment decisions to ben-
efit the funds’ beneficiaries. Portfolio 
managers generally have extensive 
experience as financial managers or 
security analysts, and many are CFAs.
Personal financial planners help 
individuals make decisions in areas 
such as insurance, investments, 
and retirement planning. Personal 
financial planners meet with their 
clients, assess their needs and 
goals, and make recommendations. 
Approximately 30 percent of personal 
financial planners are self-employed, 
and many hold certified financial 
planner (CFP) designations. Like the 
CFA, obtaining a CFP requires a spe-
cific educational background, related 
experience, and passing a comprehen-
sive examination.

The road to recovery from any disaster is paved 
with bumps and potholes. Sometimes, as in the case of 
Greensburg, Kansas, there are no roads at all. After being 
slammed by an F5 tornado, the town—which was already 
ailing economically—was forced to recreate its entire infra-
structure. But city administrator Steve Hewitt observes that 
total devastation was, in fact, a silver lining to the black 
tornado cloud. “After the storm, we had a blank canvas,” he 
says.  Hewitt observes that the destruction forced each resi-
dent and business owner to ask, “What do we need to change 
to become this thriving new community?” The city council 
passed a resolution that every facility would build at the 
greenest, most sustainable level possible.
Several years into the recovery, Hewitt says that while 
he knew the town faced great challenges, he wasn’t prepared 
for the emotional roller coaster of the entire community. As 
city administrator, he admits that this has been difficult to 
manage. Karen Alderfer, former recovery coordinator for 
the city, agrees. Her job—until the funding ran dry—was to 
keep the town’s financial matters organized, recording and 
allocating government grants, loans, and any other funds that 
arrived for the recovery effort. Both Hewitt and Alderfer 
note that they had hoped to be farther along than at 60 
percent of infrastructure completion by now—but they are 
also proud of Greensburg and its accomplishments thus far. 
While many small firms and organizations around the 
country have held benefits to raise funds for Greensburg, 
a large corporation—preferably one involved with green 
technology—hasn’t yet agreed to locate in Greensburg, 
which would give the town a significant boost in terms of 
jobs and other resources. Hewitt and Alderfer believe this 
has been due to a sluggish economy.
Still, there are concrete results. Recently the new 
$50-million Kiowa County Schools building opened to 
students. The building has such green features as windows 
placed strategically for natural light, cisterns that catch rain-
water for landscaping, and a wind turbine for power. Other 
municipal buildings, including town hall and the hospital, 
have been or will be built to sustainable standards. And the 
Silo House, a project undertaken by Greensburg Green 
Town—the not-for-profit organization that is helping to 
raise money, build, and educate the public about sustain-
able practices—is a model for future projects. Built with a 
$50,000 grant from AT&T, the Silo House has a visitor and 
education center along with a suite for eco-tourists. 
A visitor walking through the town of Greensburg would 
notice signs of both devastation and recovery. Piles of rubble 
and debris, empty lots, and treeless streets recall disaster. 
Yet Main Street is filled with residents and visitors who 
are determined to raise Greensburg from its ashes. Their 
optimism, along with the positive attitude of Steve Hewitt, 
is catching. “This is the best job in America to have,” he 
claims, “to build from the ground up.”
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Building from the ground up has many challenges. Create 
a chart outlining what you believe to be the benefits and 
drawbacks to Greensburg’s approach.
2. Discuss how a small business might get started on the 
new Main Street of Greensburg.
3. Greensburg relies on its relationship with the media to 
provide good publicity about its projects. Why is commu-
nication so important to Greensburg’s rebuilding efforts?
4. Hewitt and Alderfer express the town’s wish for a large, 
green-technology corporation to become part of the 
Greensburg community. In what ways would this benefit 
the town? What are the potential drawbacks?

Greensburg was an agricultural community before it 
was leveled by an F5 tornado, and its leaders believe that its 
cultural roots will never die. “Agriculture will always play a 
huge part in the economy,” predicts Councilman Jeanette 
Siemens, economic development director for Kiowa County, 
“but maybe in new ways.”  As the population of rural towns 
like Greensburg declines, new economic opportunities must 
replace some of the old traditions.
“There’s a great opportunity for some synergy between 
new green tech companies to work closely with the agricultural 
sector,” says Matt Christenson, recovery project coordinator 
and member of the Greensburg city council. One example 
would be a manufacturing firm whose processes use the straw 
left over from a wheat harvest to fortify building panels.
As Greensburg tries to incorporate agriculture into 
its greener future, the community is witnessing another 
change—in demographics.  “It’s a younger community,” 
observes city administrator Steve Hewitt. Growth recovery 
is coming from young business people who want to take a 
chance. One such entrepreneur is Kari Kyle, owner of the 
Green Bean Coffee Company in Greensburg. Kyle and her 
husband were both born and raised in the Greensburg area, 
but moved away for fourteen years. When they decided to 
return, Kyle applied for a business loan from the local bank, 
received it, and opened her shop in the business incuba-
tor space downtown. When a larger space became available 
across the street, she grabbed it and expanded her menu 
offerings to include ice cream malts and shakes, soda foun-
tain drinks and smoothies, as well as food. She says that 
business has tripled and is optimistic about the future. “Heck 
yeah, I know I’m going to make it,” she insists.
Joah Bussert and Stephanie Paterson are also part of 
Greensburg’s future. With degrees in architecture, as project 
managers they are helping to manage the construction of 
new buildings with green technologies. One building project 
is the Chain of Eco-Homes—a group of twelve homes with 
names like Meadowlark House and Homestead House, all 
constructed using the latest technologies. Bussert describes 
these houses as “testing grounds” to see how the tech-
nologies will perform specifically in the Midwest. Features 
include natural gas fuelmakers, double-skin walls, rooftop 
gardens, household composters, driveways made with perme-
able pavers, and of course tornado shelters. Peterson loves 
her job. “It’s like no other place in the world,” she says.
Each person involved with the reconstruction of 
Greensburg is looking far beyond its pre-tornado status, to 
a more prosperous, sustainable future. Councilman Jeanette 
Siemens sees a community that supports the entrepreneurial 
spirit and will ultimately become an educational tourist desti-
nation. Steve Hewitt acknowledges that every step of recovery 
must “have the things that attract families and businesses. The 
community will grow from young, innovative people.” He 
continues to be upbeat about Greensburg’s prospects. “I love 
what we do,” he concludes.
Questions for Critical Thinking
1. Give an example of how the factors of demand and 
supply are currently at work in Greensburg.
2. Why do Greensburg community leaders consider entre-
preneurship such a key element in the recovery and 
growth of the city?
3. What steps can the city administrator, project managers, 
and others take to change pre-tornado views about 
Greensburg?
4. Create an advertisement for Greensburg, targeting either

Apple’s iPhone: Don’t Touch the Patents!
Smart phone users knew right away they really liked the iPhone, and it quickly grabbed a big 
chunk of the cell phone market. The innovative device also spawned a long line of imitators. Not 
surprisingly, for many of the iPhone’s ground-breaking features Apple has, or is seeking, patents 
to protect them. A patent gives an inventor exclusive rights to an invention for a period of time.
One key protection that Apple sought several years ago was a patent for the iPhone’s multi-
function touch screen. Recently granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, 
Patent number 7,479,949 covers not only the screen itself but also the technology underlying the 
phone’s hardware and some of its software. Included in that patent are its operating system and 
some of its phone and camera functions. But patent protection hasn’t granted Apple immunity to 
lawsuits. Since the iPhone has been on the market, Apple has been the target of patent infringe-
ment lawsuits by other firms, including allegations that Apple copied multi-touch technology, 
visual-voice technology, and digital-camera and imaging technology. The biggest suit so far has 
come from Nokia, the world’s largest manufacturer of mobile phones, which alleges that Apple 
has infringed upon 10 of its patents related to wireless handsets. Not to be outdone, Apple has 
countersued Nokia, claiming that Nokia is infringing upon 13 of Apple’s patents. 
Do these lawsuits sound frivolous to the average consumer? Possibly. But the technology 
industry is especially complex, as innovations occur so rapidly it may be hard to determine who 
came up with an idea first—and at what stage of development that idea should be considered pro-
prietary. Patents take a long time to process, and patent infringement cases can take even longer. 
So firms are turning to the U.S. International Trade Commission instead of other courts and 
agencies because the ITC is able to move these cases along more quickly. Still, because these cases 
often involve more than two companies, they can become a tangled web of suits and countersuits.
Meanwhile, Apple also recently sued the Taiwanese mobile phone manufacturer HTC for 
infringement of 20 Apple patents connected to the iPhone, mostly those related to iPhone’s graph-
ical user interface. Apple is seeking a permanent injunction, prohibiting HTC from selling its 
phones in the United States. “We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, 
or we can do something about it,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder and CEO. “We think com-
petition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.”
HTC claims that it was completely surprised by Apple’s lawsuit. “HTC is a mobile-technology 
innovator and patent holder that has been very focused over the past 13 years on creating many of the 
most innovative smartphones,” said a company spokesperson in response to the suit. “HTC values pat-
ent rights and their enforcement, but is also committed to defending its own technology innovations.”
Some business law experts note that that it is interesting that Apple did not name software 
makers Google or Microsoft in its legal action against HTC, which makes such popular phones 
as the Nexus One. The Nexus One is sold by Google, and several other phones named in the suit 
use Microsoft’s Windows Mobile software. 
These cases underscore the importance of every businessperson understanding the basics of 
business law. Whether you plan to market high-tech devices such as smart phones or sell a simple 
pair of shoes online, as a businessperson you will need to know the fundamental laws that govern 
your business activities.1

Legal issues affect every aspect of busi-
ness. Despite the best efforts of most busi-
nesspeople, legal cases do arise. A dispute 
may arise over a contract, an employee may 
protest being passed over for a promotion, 
or a town may challenge the environmental 
impact of a new gas station. Unfortunately, 
the United States has the dubious distinction 
of being the world’s most litigious society. 
Lawsuits are as common as business deals. 
Consider Walmart, which is involved in as 
many as 7,000 legal cases at any one time. 
Even if you are never involved in a lawsuit, 
the cost still affects you. The average U.S. 
family pays a hidden “litigation tax” of 5 
percent each year because of the costs of 
lawsuits that force businesses to increase 
their prices. Small businesses, like dentists’ 
offices, doctors’ offices, and daycare provid-
ers are often the hardest hit and may cut 
back on their services or close. The total 
cost of frivolous lawsuits—those brought 
for petty reasons—runs about $865 billion 
a year. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure was designed in 1993 to prevent 
frivolous lawsuits, but has been weakened by 
loopholes.2
On the lighter side, every day brings 
news reports of proposed laws intended to 
protect businesses, consumers, and the gen-
eral public—but somehow miss the mark. 
In addition, old laws are still on the books 
that no longer serve a purpose and are all 
but forgotten. For instance, in Alaska, it’s 
illegal to wake a bear to take its picture, but 
it is perfectly legal to shoot a bear while it is 
sleeping. In Hawaii, it is against the law to 
insert pennies in your ear. In Louisiana, it 
is illegal to gargle in public. In Montana, it 
is against the law to operate a vehicle with 
ice picks attached to the wheels. In North 
Carolina, it is illegal to use elephants to plow 
cotton fields. And in Arizona, it’s illegal 
to hunt camels.3 The origin of these laws 
raises about as many questions as the laws 
themselves.
Legislation that specifically affects 
the business functions is analyzed in each 
chapter of this book. Chapter 2 presents 
an overview of the legal environment, and 
legislation affecting international operations 
is covered in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 discusses 
laws related to small businesses. Laws 
regarding human resource management and 
labor unions are examined in Chapter 8. 
Laws affecting other business operations, 
such as environmental regulations and 
product safety, are one of the topics in 
Chapter 12, and marketing-related legisla-
tion is examined in Chapter 13. Finally, 
legislation pertaining to banking and the 
securities markets is discussed in Chapters 
16 and 17.
In this appendix, we provide a general 
perspective of legislation at the federal, state, 
and local levels, and point out that, while 
business executives may not be legal experts, 
they do need to be knowledgeable in their 
specific area of responsibility. A good dose 
of common sense also helps avoid potential 
legal problems. This appendix looks at the 
general nature of business law, the court sys-
tem, basic legal concepts, and the changing 
regulatory environment for U.S. business. 
Let’s start with some initial definitions and 
related examples.

Appendix A
Legal System and 
Administrative Agencies
The judiciary, or court system, is the branch of government responsible for settling 
disputes among parties by applying laws. This branch consists of several types and levels of 
courts, each with a specific jurisdiction. Court systems are organized at the federal, state, and 
local levels. Administrative agencies also perform some limited judicial functions, but these 
agencies are more properly regarded as belonging to the executive or legislative branches of 
government.
At both the federal and state levels, trial courts—courts of general jurisdiction—hear a 
wide range of cases. Unless a case is assigned by law to another court or to an administrative 
agency, a court of general jurisdiction will hear it. The majority of cases, both criminal and 
civil, pass through these courts. Within the federal system, trial courts are known as U.S. 
district courts, and at least one such court operates in each state. In the state court systems, 
the general jurisdiction courts are often called circuit courts, and states typically provide one 
for each county. Other names for general jurisdiction courts are superior courts, common 
pleas courts, or district courts.
State judiciary systems also include many courts with lower, or more specific, jurisdic-
tions. In most states, parties can appeal the decisions of these lower courts to the general 
jurisdiction courts. Examples of lower courts are probate courts—which settle the estates of 
people who have died—and small-claims courts—where people can represent themselves in 
suits involving limited amounts of money. For example, a landlord might go to small-claims 
court to settle a dispute with a tenant over a security deposit.
Decisions made at the general trial court level may be appealed in appellate courts. Both 
the federal and state systems have appellate courts. For instance, the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Fourth Circuit, which is based in Richmond, Virginia, covers the states of Maryland, 
Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.4 The appeals process allows a 
higher court to review the case and correct any lower court error indicated by the appellant, 
the party making the appeal.
Appeals from decisions of the U.S. circuit courts of appeals can go all the way to the 
nation’s highest court, the U.S. Supreme Court. Appeals from state courts of appeal are 
heard by the highest court in each state, usually called the state supreme court. In a state with-
out intermediate appellate courts, the state supreme court hears appeals directly from the 
trial courts. Parties who are not satisfied by the verdict of a state supreme court can appeal 
to the U.S. Supreme Court and may be granted a hearing if they can cite grounds for such 
an appeal, and if the Supreme Court considers the case significant enough to be heard. The 
Supreme Court typically has more than 10,000 cases on the docket per year. However, only 
about 100 are granted review with oral arguments by attorneys. Formal written decisions are 
delivered for 80 to 90 of those cases.5
While most cases are resolved by the system of courts described here, certain highly spe-
cialized cases require particular expertise. Examples of specialized federal courts are the U.S. 
Tax Court for tax cases and the U.S. Court of Claims, which hears claims against the U.S. 
government itself. Similar specialized courts operate at the state level.
Administrative agencies, also known as bureaus, commissions, or boards, decide a 
variety of cases at all levels of government. These agencies usually derive their powers and 
judiciary court system, or 
branch of government that 
is responsible for settling 
disputes by applying laws.

responsibilities from state or federal statutes. Technically, they conduct hearings or  inquiries 
rather than trials. Examples of federal administrative agencies are the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC), the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FTC has the broadest power of any of the federal 
regulatory agencies. It enforces laws regulating unfair business practices, and it can stop false 
and deceptive advertising practices. Examples at the state level include public utility commis-
sions and boards that govern the licensing of various trades and professions. Zoning boards, 
planning commissions, and boards of appeal operate at the city or county level.
Types of Law
Law consists of the standards set by government and society in the form of either leg-
islation or custom. This broad body of principles, regulations, rules, and customs that gov-
ern the actions of all members of society, including businesspeople, is derived from several 
sources. Common law refers to the body of law arising out of judicial decisions, some of 
which can be traced back to early England. For example, in some states, an unmarried cou-
ple who has lived together for a certain period of time is said to be legally husband and wife 
by common law.
Statutory law, or written law, includes state and federal constitutions, 
legislative enactments, treaties of the federal government, and ordinances of 
local governments. Statutes must be drawn precisely and reasonably to be 
constitutional, and thus enforceable. Still, courts must frequently interpret 
their intentions and meanings.
With the growth of the global economy, knowledge of international law 
becomes crucial. International law refers to the numerous regulations that 
govern international commerce. Companies must be aware of the domestic 
laws of trading partners, trade agreements such as NAFTA, and the rulings of 
such organizations as the World Trade Organization. International law affects 
trade in all kinds of industries. When a range of defective or tainted products 
manufactured in China—but sold in the United States—was recalled, com-
panies discovered that although the goods came from China, the liability for 
their defects lay squarely within the United States. Tainted or defective tooth-
paste, pet food, toys, tires, and shrimp all fell under the scrutiny of the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), the Consumer Product Safety Commission 
(CPSC), and other agencies, which hold U.S. manufacturers responsible for 
the quality of their foreign-made products. Recent cases that involve lawsuits 
against Chinese manufacturers of construction drywall have presented evi-
dence that the drywall contains high levels of corrosive gases that have caused 
health problems among inhabitants of buildings. The CPSC, Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) have all become involved in these cases, which could ultimately result 
in billions of dollars in damages awarded to affected homeowners.6
In a broad sense, all law is business law because all firms are subject to 
the entire body of law, just as individuals are. In a narrower sense, however, 
business law consists of those aspects of law that most directly influence 
and regulate the management of various types of business activity. Specific 
laws vary widely in their intent from business to business and from industry 
to industry. The legal interests of airlines, for example, differ from those of 
oil companies.

State and local statutes also have varying applications. Some state laws affect all 
businesses that operate in a particular state. Workers’ compensation laws, which govern 
payments to workers for injuries incurred on the job, are an example. Other state laws 
apply only to certain firms or business activities. States have specific licensing requirements 
for businesses, such as law firms, funeral directors, and hair salons. Many local ordinances 
also deal with specific business activities. Local regulations on the sizes and types of busi-
ness signs are commonplace. Some communities even restrict the sizes of stores, including 
height and square footage.
Regulatory Environment 
for Business
Government regulation of business has changed over time. Depending on public sen-
timent, the economy, and the political climate, we see the pendulum swing back and forth 
between increased regulation and deregulation. But the goal of both types of legislation is 
protection of healthy competition. One industry that has experienced some deregulation 
in the past is still subject to relatively tight regulations: banking. Despite the relaxation 
of banking regulations across state lines and the advent of online banking, laws governing 
everything from stock trading to retirement investing remain strict. In response to a crisis 
in which lending institutions granted mortgages to home buyers who were then unable 
to meet payments that later increased—precipitating record numbers of foreclosures—a 
new bill was introduced in Congress. The Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending 
Act of 2007 modifies the Truth in Lending Act. The intent of this legislation is to protect 
consumers by establishing fair lending practices. Further modification of the Truth in 
Lending Act deals with practices by credit card lenders. Under the new law, credit card 
issuers may not be able to hike interest rates on existing balances if consumers pay their 
balances on time, and they must notify consumers at least 45 days in advance of interest 
rate increases and other fee changes. However, while these new protections apply to indi-
vidual consumers, they do not apply to small business owners who often use credit cards 
for purchases.7
Let’s look at the issues surrounding regulation and deregulation and the legislation that 
has characterized them.
Antitrust and Business Regulation
John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly launched antitrust legislation. Breaking up 
monopolies and restraints of trade was a popular issue in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In 
fact, President Theodore Roosevelt always promoted himself as a “trust-buster.” The highly 
publicized Microsoft case of the 1990s is another example of antitrust litigation.
During the 1930s, several laws designed to regulate business were passed. The 
basis for many of these laws was protecting employment. The world was in the midst of 
the Great Depression during the 1930s, so the government was focused on keeping its 
citizens employed. Recently, government officials became concerned with the security 
aspects of international business transactions, Internet usage, the sources of funds, and their 
effects on U.S. business practices. So, new regulatory legislation in the form of the USA 
Patriot Act was enacted in 2001. In 2005 Congress voted to reauthorize the act, and in 2010 
the House and Senate each submitted renewals containing provisions dealing with business 
records.8

A-6
Appendix A
The major federal antitrust and business regulation legislation includes the following:
LAW
WHAT IT DID
Sherman Act (1890)
Set a competitive business system as a national policy goal. The act specifically banned 
monopolies and restraints of trade.
Clayton Act (1914)
Put restrictions on price discrimination, exclusive dealing, tying contracts, and interlocking 
boards of directors that lessened competition or might lead to a monopoly.
Federal Trade Commission 
Act (1914)
Established the FTC with the authority to investigate business practices. The act also pro-
hibited unfair methods of competition.
Robinson-Patman Act (1936)
Outlawed price discrimination in sales to wholesalers, retailers, or other producers. The 
act also banned pricing designed to eliminate competition.
Wheeler-Lea Act (1938)
Banned deceptive advertising. The act gave the FTC jurisdiction in such cases.
USA Patriot Act (2001; 
extended in 2005 and 2010)
Limited interactions between U.S. and foreign banks to those with “know your customer” 
policies; allowed the U.S. Treasury Department to freeze assets and bar a country, govern-
ment, or institution from doing business in the United States; gave federal authorities 
broad powers to monitor Internet usage and expanded the way data is shared among 
different agencies. Reauthorization (2005) created a new Assistant Attorney General for 
Security, enhanced penalties for terrorism financing, and provided clear standards and 
penalties for attacks on mass transit systems.
The protection of fair competition remains an issue in industries today. According to 
the Federal Trade Commission (FCC), 78 percent of U.S. households have access to 
two land-based broadband Internet providers, and 13 percent have access to one. Only 
4 percent of households have a choice of three broadband services. But when the FCC 
cracked down on Comcast for interfering with customers’ access to competing Internet 
services, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC had exceeded its authority.9
Business Deregulation
Deregulation was a child of the 1970s whose influence continues today. Many formerly 
regulated industries were freed to pick the markets they wanted to serve. The deregulated 
industries, such as utilities and airlines, were also allowed to price their products without 
the guidance of federal regulations. For the most part, deregulation led to lower consumer 
prices. In some cases, it also led to a loss of service. Many smaller cities and airports lost 
airline service for a while because of deregulation. But small and discount airlines such as 
Southwest and JetBlue began to focus on and serve those locations.
Following are several major laws related to deregulation:
LAW
WHAT IT DID
Airline Deregulation Act (1978)
Allowed airlines to set fares and pick their routes.
Motor Carrier Act and Staggers Rail Act (1980)
Permitted the trucking and railroad industries to negotiate rates and 
services.
Telecommunications Act (1996)
Cut barriers to competition in local and long-distance phone, cable, and 
television markets.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (1999)
Permitted banks, securities firms, and insurance companies to affiliate 
within a new financial organizational structure; required them to dis-
close to customers their policies and practices for protecting the privacy 
of personal information.

A-7
Appendix A
Consumer Protection
Numerous laws designed to protect consumers have been passed in the last 100 years. 
In many ways, business itself has evolved to reflect this focus on consumer safety and satis-
faction. Recently, Congress passed the broadest changes in the country’s consumer protec-
tion system in decades, including stricter regulations governing toy manufacturing, public 
access to complaints about products, and a major overhaul of the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC) designed to improve communication and efficiency. One provi-
sion includes stricter limits on the amount of lead in children’s toys, and another requires 
mandatory safety standards for nursery items like cribs and playpens. However, legislators 
continue to battle over the creation of an independent regulatory agency for the consumer 
financial protection, which would oversee the financial industry.10 The Food and Drug 
Administration Amendments Act (FDAA) of 2007 reauthorizes existing laws and includes 
new provisions designed to enhance drug safety, encourage the development of pediatric 
medical devices, and enhance food safety.11
The major federal laws related to consumer protection include the following:
LAW
WHAT IT DID
Federal Food and Drug Act (1906)
Banned adulteration and misbranding of foods and drugs involved in 
interstate commerce.
Consumer Credit Protection Act (1968)
Required disclosure of annual interest rates on loans and credit 
purchases.
National Environmental Policy Act (1970)
Established the Environmental Protection Agency to deal with various 
types of pollution and organizations that create pollution.
Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act (1970)
Prohibited tobacco advertising on radio and television.
Consumer Product Safety Act (1972)
Established the Consumer Product Safety Commission with authority 
to specify safety standards for most products.
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (1990)
Stipulated detailed information on the labeling of most foods.
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act 
(1994) Cation Act (1994)
Established standards with respect to dietary supplements including 
vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and the like.
Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act 
of 2007
Reauthorized several laws dealing with prescription drugs and added 
new ones enhancing food safety, drug safety, development of pediat-
ric medical devices, and clinical trial registries.
Employee Protection
Chapters 2 and 8 cover many of the issues employers face in protecting their employees 
from injury and harm while on the job. But employees must also be protected from unfair 
practices by employers. Recently the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEOC) sued a prominent law firm for age bias because the firm requires partners to give 
up their ownership interests in the firm when they turn 70. This situation can exist in any 
professional business—accounting firms, architectural firms, and doctors’ groups. “With so 
many baby boomers reaching traditional retirement age, (retirement policies) are probably 
one of the biggest issues facing law firms today,” says an industry consultant.12

A-8
Appendix A
Some of the relevant laws related to employee protection include the following:
LAW
WHAT IT DID
Fair Labor Standards Act (1938)
For hourly workers, provided payment of the minimum wage, overtime pay for time 
worked over 40 hours in a workweek, restricted the employment of children, and 
required employers to keep records of wages and hours.
OSHA Act (1970)
Required employers to provide workers with workplaces free of recognized hazards 
that could cause serious injury or death and requires employees to abide by all safety 
and health standards that apply to their jobs. 
Americans with Disabilities Act 
(1991)
Banned discrimination against the disabled in public accommodations, transportation, 
and telecommunications.
Family and Medical Leave Act 
(1993)
Required covered employers to grant eligible employees up to 12 workweeks of 
unpaid leave during any 12-month period for the birth and care of a newborn 
child of the employee, placement with the employee of a son or daughter for 
adoption or foster care, care of an immediate family member with a serious 
health condition, or medical leave for the employee if unable to work because of 
a serious health condition.
Uniformed Services Employment 
and Reemployment Rights Act 
(1994)
Protects the job rights of individuals who voluntarily or involuntarily leave their jobs to 
perform military service. Also prohibits employment discrimination in such cases.
American Jobs Creation Act 
(2004)
Reduced taxes for manufacturing in the United States, provided temporary tax breaks 
for income repatriated to the United States, and encouraged domestic job growth.
Pension Protection Act (2006)
Required companies with underfunded pension plans to pay extra premiums; made it 
easier for companies to automatically enroll employees in defined contribution plans; 
provided greater access to professional advice about investing.
Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act (2010) and the 
Health Care and Education 
Reconciliation Act (2010)
Health-related provisions to expand Medicaid eligibility, subsidize insurance premiums, 
provide businesses with incentives to provide health care benefits, prohibit claims 
denied for pre-existing conditions.
Investor Protection
Chapters 15, 16, and 17 describe the institutions subject to investor protection laws and 
some of the events that brought the Sarbanes-Oxley law into being. (See the entry in the fol-
lowing table for specific provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley.) Following is a summary of legislation 
to protect investors:
LAW
WHAT IT DID
Securities Exchange Act (1934)
Created the Securities and Exchange Commission with the authority to register, 
regulate, and oversee brokerage firms, transfer agents, clearing agencies, and 
stock exchanges; the SEC also has the power to enforce securities laws and 
protect investors in public transactions.
Bank Secrecy Act (1970)
Deterred laundering and use of secret foreign bank accounts; created an inves-
tigative paper trail for large currency transactions; imposed civil and criminal 
penalties for noncompliance with reporting requirements; improved detection 
and investigation of criminal, tax, and regulatory violations.

A-9
Appendix A
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002)
Required top corporate executives to attest to the validity of the company’s 
financial statements; increased the documentation and monitoring of internal 
controls; prohibited CPA firms from providing some types of consulting services 
for their clients; established a five-member accounting oversight board.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (2010)
Creates new regulations for companies that extend credit to consumers; 
exempts small public companies from Sarbanes-Qxley section of law; changes 
registration requirements for investment advisers.
Cyberspace and 
Telecommunications Protection
Computers and widespread use of the Internet and telecommunications have 
 dramatically expanded the reach of businesses. They have also raised some thorny issues 
such as computer fraud and abuse, online privacy, cyberbullying, and cyberterrorism. 
Under a Supreme Court ruling, Internet file-sharing services are now held accountable 
if their intention is for consumers to use software to exchange songs and videos illegally. 
This ruling helps protect copyrights, which are covered later in this appendix. Recently 
Viacom—the parent company of MTV and Comedy Central—sued YouTube and its 
parent company, Google, for $1 billion in federal court, claiming “massive intentional 
copyright infringement.” Viacom argued that YouTube’s success was partly built on the 
unlicensed use of video taken from Viacom cable channels. Google and YouTube denied 
the claim, but later Google unveiled a copyright filter designed to catch unauthorized 
use of copyrighted videos and other materials. The judge dismissed the case finding that 
YouTube was protected by the Digital Millenium Copyright Act’s safe harbor clause. This 
states that companies can be protected is their services host content without review as 
long as infringing content is removed quickly.13
Following are some of the major laws enacted to regulate cyberspace and telecommunications:
LAW
WHAT IT DID
Computer Fraud and Abuse 
Act (1986)
Clarified definitions of criminal fraud and abuse for federal computer crimes and removed 
legal ambiguities and obstacles to prosecuting these crimes; established felony offenses 
for unauthorized access of “federal interest” computers and made it a misdemeanor to 
engage in unauthorized trafficking in computer passwords.
Children’s Online Privacy 
Protection Act (1998)
Authorized the FTC to set rules regarding how and when firms must obtain parental per-
mission before asking children marketing research questions.
Identity Theft and 
Assumption Deterrence 
Act (1998)
Made it a federal crime to knowingly transfer or use, without lawful authority, a means 
of identification of another person with intent to commit, aid, or abet any violation of 
federal, state, or local law.
Anticybersquatting Consumer 
Protection Act (1999)
Prohibited people from registering Internet domain names similar to company or celebrity 
names and then offering them for sale to these same parties.
Homeland Security Act 
(2002)
Established the Department of Homeland Security; gave government wide new powers 
to collect and mine data on individuals and groups, including databases that combine 
personal, governmental, and corporate records including e-mails and Web sites viewed; 
limited information citizens can obtain under the Freedom of Information Act; gave gov-
ernment committees more latitude for meeting in secret.

Appendix A
Amendments to the 
Telemarketing Sales Rule 
(2003), extended by the 
Do-Not-Call Improvement 
Act of 2007 and the 
Do-Not-Call Fee Extension 
Act of 2007
Created a national “do not call” registry, which prohibits telemarketing calls to registered 
telephone numbers; restricted the number and duration of telemarketing calls generating 
dead air space with use of automatic dialers; cracked down on unauthorized billing; and 
required telemarketers to transmit their caller ID information. Telemarketers must check 
the do-not-call list quarterly, and violators could be fined as much as $11,000 per occur-
rence. Excluded from the registry’s restrictions are charities, opinion pollsters, and political 
candidates. The 2007 DNC Improvement Act allowed registered numbers to remain on the 
list permanently, unless consumers call to remove them themselves; the FTC will remove 
disconnected and reassigned numbers from the list. The Fee Extension Act of 2007 set 
annual fees telemarketers must pay to access the registry.
Check Clearing for the 21st 
Century Act (2003)
Created a substitute check, allowing banks to process check information electronically and 
to deliver substitute checks to banks that want to continue receiving paper checks. A sub-
stitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check.
The Core of Business Law
Contract law and the law of agency; the Uniform Commercial Code, sales law, and 
negotiable instruments law; property law and the law of bailment; trademark, patent, and 
copyright law; tort law; bankruptcy law; and tax law are the cornerstones of U.S. business 
law. The sections that follow set out the key provisions of each of these legal concepts.
Contract Law and Law of Agency
Contract law is important because it is the legal foundation on which business dealings 
are conducted. A contract is a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties 
regarding a specified act or thing.
Contract Requirements As Figure A.1 points out, the four elements of an 
enforceable contract are agreement, consideration, legal and serious purpose, and  capacity. 
The parties must reach agreement about the act or thing specified. For such an  agreement, 
or contract, to be valid and legally enforceable, each party must  furnish 
consideration—the value or benefit that a party provides to the others with 
whom the contract is made. Assume that a builder hires an  electrician 
to install wiring in a new house. The wiring job and the resulting pay-
ment are the considerations in this instance. In addition to consideration, 
an enforceable contract must involve a legal and serious purpose. 
Agreements made as a joke or involving the commission of crimes are 
not enforceable as legal contracts. An agreement between two competi-
tors to fix the prices for their products is not enforceable as a contract 
because the subject matter is illegal.
The last element of a legally enforceable contract is capacity, the 
legal ability of a party to enter into agreements. The law does not permit 
certain people, such as those judged to be insane, to enter into legally 
enforceable contracts. Contracts govern almost all types of business 
activities. You might sign a contract to purchase a car or cell phone ser-
vice, or to lease an apartment.
Breach of Contract A violation of a valid contract is called 
a breach of contract. The injured party can go to court to enforce the con-
tract provisions and, in some cases, collect damages—financial payments 
to compensate for a loss and related suffering.

Appendix A
Law of Agency All types of firms conduct business affairs through a variety of 
agents, such as partners, directors, corporate officers, and sales personnel. An agency 
relationship exists when one party, called the principal, appoints another party, called the 
agent, to enter into contracts with third parties on the principal’s behalf.
The law of agency is based on common-law principles and case law decisions of state 
and federal courts. Relatively little agency law has been enacted into statute. The law of 
agency is important because the principal is generally bound by the actions of the agent.
The legal basis for holding the principal liable for acts of the agent is the Latin maxim 
respondeat superior (“let the master answer”). In a case involving agency law, the court must 
decide the rights and obligations of the various parties. Generally, the principal is held liable 
if an agency relationship exists and the agent has some type of authority to do the wrongful 
act. The agent in such cases is liable to the principal for any damages.
Uniform Commercial Code
Most U.S. business law is based on the Uniform Commercial Code—usually referred to simply 
as the UCC. The UCC covers topics such as sales law, warranties, and negotiable instruments. 
All 50 states have adopted the UCC, although Louisiana also relies on elements of civil law 
based on French, German, and Spanish codes, in addition to Roman law. While the other 
U.S. states rely on the tenets of English common law, which is also known as judge-based law, 
Louisiana’s civil law system is found in most European nations. The UCC is actually a “model 
law” first written by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, 
which states can then review and adopt, adopt with amendments, or replace with their own 
laws. The idea of the UCC is to create at least some degree of uniformity among the states.14
Sales law governs sales of goods or services for money or on credit. Article 2 of the 
UCC specifies the circumstances under which a buyer and a seller enter into a sales con-
tract. Such agreements are based on the express conduct of the parties. The UCC generally 
requires written agreements for enforceable sales contracts for products worth more than 
$500. The formation of a sales contract is quite flexible because certain missing terms in a 
written contract or other ambiguities do not prevent the contract from being legally enforce-
able. A court will look to past dealings, commercial customs, and other standards of reason-
ableness to evaluate whether a legal contract exists.
Courts also consider these variables when either the buyer or the seller seeks to enforce 
his or her rights in cases in which the other party fails to perform as specified in the con-
tract, performs only partially, or performs in a defective or unsatisfactory way. The UCC’s 
remedies in such cases usually involve the award of monetary damages to injured parties. 
The UCC defines the rights of the parties to have the contract performed, to have it termi-
nated, and to reclaim the goods or place a lien—a legal claim—against them.
Warranties Article 2 of the UCC also sets forth the law of warranties for sales 
transactions. Products carry two basic types of warranties: an express warranty is a specific 
representation made by the seller regarding the product, and an implied warranty is only 
legally imposed on the seller. Generally, unless implied warranties are disclaimed by the 
seller in writing, they are automatically in effect. Other provisions govern the rights of 
acceptance, rejection, and inspection of products by the buyer; the rights of the parties dur-
ing manufacture, shipment, delivery, and passing of title to products; the legal significance of 
sales documents; and the placement of the risk of loss in the event of destruction or damage 
to the products during manufacture, shipment, or delivery.
Negotiable Instruments A negotiable instrument is commercial paper that is 
transferable among individuals and businesses. The most common example of a negotiable 
sales law law govern-
ing the sale of goods or 
services for money or on 
credit.

Appendix A
instrument is a check. Drafts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and notes are also sometimes 
considered negotiable instruments.
Article 3 of the UCC specifies that a negotiable instrument must be written and must 
meet the following conditions:
1. It must be signed by the maker or drawer.
2. It must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a certain sum of money.
3. It must be payable on demand or at a definite time.
4. It must be payable to order or to bearer.
Checks and other forms of commercial paper are transferred when the payee signs the 
back of the instrument, a procedure known as endorsement.
Property Law and Law of Bailment
Property law is a key feature of the private enterprise system. Property is something for 
which a person or firm has the unrestricted right of possession or use. Property rights are 
guaranteed and protected by the U.S. Constitution. However, under certain circumstances 
property may be legally seized under the law of eminent domain. In a U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling, the city of New London, Connecticut, was granted permission to seize a distressed 
area of real estate—owned by individual citizens—for future economic development by 
private business. In fact, this development was never completed. In response, 43 states 
have since passed legislation limiting the use of eminent domain. New York faced a similar 
problem when an appellate court ruled that land and businesses occupying land wanted by 
Columbia University for its expansion could not be seized by eminent domain.15 And in an 
unusual twist of the law, Utah passed two bills allowing the state to take some of the U.S. 
government’s vast federal land holdings by eminent domain.16
As Figure A.2 shows, property can be divided into three basic categories. Tangible 
personal property consists of physical items such as equipment, supplies, and delivery vehicles. 
Intangible personal property is nonphysical property such as 
mortgages, stocks, and checks that are most often represented by 
a document or other written instrument, although it may be as 
vague and remote as a computer entry. You are probably familiar 
with certain types of intangible personal property such as checks 
or money orders. But other examples include bonds, notes, let-
ters of credit, and receipts.
A third category of property is real property, or real estate. 
Most firms have some interaction with real estate law because 
of the need to buy or lease the space in which they operate. 
Some companies are created to serve these real estate needs. 
Real estate developers, builders, contractors, brokers, appraisers, 
mortgage companies, escrow companies, title companies, and 
architects all deal with various aspects of real property law.
The law of bailment deals with the surrender of personal 
property by one person to another when the property is to be 
returned at a later date. The person delivering the property is 
known as the bailor, and the person receiving the property is the 
bailee. Some bailments benefit bailees, others benefit  bailors, 
and still others provide mutual benefits. Most courts now require

that all parties practice reasonable care in all bailment situations. The degree of benefit 
received from the bailment is a factor in court decisions about whether parties have met the 
reasonable-care standards.
Bailment disputes are most likely to arise in business settings such as hotels, 
 restaurants, banks, and parking lots. A series of rules have been established to govern 
settlement of these disagreements. The law focuses on actual delivery of an item. For 
instance, a restaurant owner is not liable if a customer’s coat or purse is stolen from 
the back of his or her chair. This is because the customer has not given the item to the 
restaurant for safekeeping. However, if the customer delivers the coat or purse to the 
restaurant checkroom, receives a claim check, and the item is stolen, then the restaurant 
is liable.
Trademarks, Patents, and Copyrights
Trademarks, patents, and copyrights provide legal protection for key business assets by 
giving a firm the exclusive right to use these assets. A trademark consists of words, symbols, 
or other designations used by firms to identify their offerings. The Lanham Act (1946) pro-
vides for federal registration of trademarks. Trademarks are a valuable commercial property. 
Coca-Cola and McDonald’s are two of the world’s most widely recognized trademarks, so 
they are very valuable to the companies that own them.
If a product becomes too well known, its fame can create problems. Once a trademark 
becomes a part of everyday usage, it loses its protection as a legal trademark. Consider the 
words aspirin, cola, nylon, kerosene, and linoleum. All these product names were once the exclu-
sive property of their manufacturers, but they have passed into common language, and now 
anyone can use them. More recent examples are Xerox, Kleenex, and Velcro. Although legally 
these are trademarked names, people often use them in everyday language instead of the cor-
rect generic terms photocopy, facial tissue, and hook-and-loop.
Companies understand the value of their trademarks and fight hard to protect them. 
Louis Vuitton sued Google for allowing other companies to bid for and use the firm’s trade-
marked brand names as keywords to trigger ads on Google’s site. Louis Vuitton lost the 
lawsuit, but a European court ruled that companies borrowing such keywords must be more 
transparent about who they are and what they are actually selling.17
By law, a patent guarantees an inventor exclusive rights to an invention for 17 years. 
Copyrights and patents have a constitutional basis; the U.S. Constitution specifies that the 
federal government has the power “to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by 
securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive rights to their respective 
writings or discoveries.” Recently, the patent process and laws have been under scrutiny, and 
the Patent Reform Act was introduced in 2007. Under the act, which is supported by the 
information technology industry, it is now more difficult for firms to sue for patent infringe-
ment. Instead of filing for a patent on a first-to-invent basis, firms will receive patents on a 
first-to-file basis, which is more common around the world.18
A copyright protects written or printed material such as books, designs, cartoon 
illustrations, photos, computer software, music, and videos. This class of business property is 
referred to as intellectual property. Copyrights are filed with the Library of Congress. Congress 
recently extended copyright protection for creative material by an additional 20 years,  covering 
artistic works for the lifetime of the creator plus 70 years; for companies the time is 95 years. 
Not surprisingly, the Internet has opened up a whole new realm of copyright infringement, 
ranging from downloading music files to illegally sharing video footage.

Google faces a challenge both here and abroad as it compiles a massive digital library 
in an effort to create the world’s largest online library. Already Google has put nearly 
10 million books from around the world online. The firm has been challenged by authors 
and publishers on potential copyright infringement, and the U.S. Department of Justice is 
trying to find a way to reach a settlement that benefits all parties. Meanwhile, France and 
Germany oppose any kind of settlement because they are supporting a European book-scan-
ning project that complies with their own laws—which require permission from copyright 
holders before the books are scanned.19
Despite publicity about Internet copyright infringement, many people engage in the 
practice unintentionally. Some schools are now making an effort to educate students about 
the practice so they can make better and more informed choices about downloading material 
from the Internet.
Law of Torts
A tort (French for “wrong”) refers to a civil wrong inflicted on another person or the 
person’s property. The law of torts is closely related to the law of agency because a busi-
ness entity, or principal, can be held liable for torts committed by its agents in the course of 
business dealings. Tort law differs from both criminal and contract law. While criminal law 
is concerned with crimes against the state or society, tort law deals with compensation for 
injured people who are the victims of noncriminal wrongs.
Tort cases are often extremely complex and may result in large monetary awards. 
Hundreds of New Jersey residents have filed a tort lawsuit against E.I. DuPont and Royle 
Systems Group for allegedly dumping toxic material around a residential area—and refusing 
to clean it up. The case involves linking serious health problems to the chemicals deposited 
nearby—and proving that the companies knew what they were doing.20
Types of Torts A tort may be intentional, or it may be caused by negligence. 
Assault, slander, libel, and fraud are all examples of intentional torts. Businesses can become 
involved in such cases through the actions of both owners and employees. A security guard 
who uses excessive force to apprehend an alleged shoplifter may have committed a tort. 
Under agency law, the guard’s employers, such as a shopping mall or retailer, can be also 
held liable for any damages or injury caused by the security guard.
The other major group of torts results from negligence. This type of tort is based on 
carelessness rather than intentional behavior that causes injury to another person. Under 
agency law, businesses can also be held liable for the negligence of their employees or 
agents. A delivery truck driver who injures a pedestrian while transporting goods creates a 
tort liability for his or her employer if the accident results from negligence.
Product Liability An area of tort law known as product liability has been developed 
by both statutory and case law to hold businesses liable for negligence in the design, manu-
facture, sale, or use of products. Some states have extended the theory of tort law to cover 
injuries caused by products, regardless of whether the manufacturer is proven negligent. 
This legal concept is known as strict product liability.
The business response to product liability has been mixed. To avoid lawsuits and fines, 
some recall defective products voluntarily; others decide to fight recall mandates if they 
believe the recall is not justified. Auto manufacturers and toy makers typically issue voluntary 
recalls, as do drug manufacturers.

Appendix A
Class-Action Fairness
A class-action suit groups a number of individual plaintiffs, such as consumers with adverse 
reactions to medications, to allow for efficient processing under one lawsuit. Several years ago, 
Congress passed the Class-Action Fairness Act of 2005. The act imposes certain restrictions 
on class-action lawsuits. First, it automatically moves most large, multistate class actions—
those with potential damages exceeding $5 million and in which more than two-thirds 
of the plaintiffs are geographically dispersed—from state courts into federal courts. This 
restriction prevents “shopping around” for sympathetic locations but lets cases that belong 
within a particular state remain there. Second, judges must consider the actual monetary value 
of any damage done so that plaintiffs receive true compensation for injury instead of large, 
arbitrary awards. Third, attorneys now receive payment differently. Under the old system, 
attorneys would receive a percentage of the gross settlement amount, regardless of whether all 
plaintiffs collected. Now judges can require uncollected awards to go to charity or govern-
ment agencies, instead of into the pockets of lawyers. If the attorneys’ fees are not based on a 
percentage, then they must charge based on the time they spent on the case.
Effects of the act are already being felt. In many states, the tide has already begun to 
turn away from huge, long, expensive lawsuits. Some states have passed their own laws 
restricting the types of suits that can be filed. Michigan has virtually eliminated class-action 
suits against drug manufacturers, and New York threw out a case accusing investment firms 
of manipulating the price of certain initial stock offerings. Twenty-three states have insti-
tuted statutes prohibiting suits against fast-food restaurants for causing obesity. And damage 
limits in many states have restricted medical malpractice suits. 
Bankruptcy Law
Bankruptcy, legal nonpayment of financial obligations, is a common occurrence in 
contemporary society. Federal legislation passed in 1918 and revised several times since then 
provides a system for handling bankruptcies. Bankruptcy has two purposes. One is to protect 
creditors by providing a way to obtain compensation through debtors’ assets. The second 
goal, which is almost unique to the United States, is to also protect debtors, allowing them 
to get a fresh financial start.
Federal law recognizes two types of bankruptcy. Under voluntary bankruptcy, a person 
or firm asks to be judged bankrupt because of inability to repay creditors. Under involuntary 
bankruptcy, creditors may request that a party be judged bankrupt.
Personal Bankruptcies
With a growing number of individuals amassing large personal debt—often through 
credit cards—Congress recently revised personal bankruptcy law to make it more difficult 
for people to erase their debt instead of being held accountable for it. Under the Bankruptcy 
Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, it is harder for individuals to file 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which traditionally has wiped out most debt. If their earnings exceed 
their state’s median income, they will instead be required to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy, 
which sets up a repayment plan as designed by the court. A few years after the law’s pas-
sage, personal bankruptcies still hovered at the high mark, likely because of a slow economy.

Reports revealed that more homeowners were walking away from large mortgages that they 
were unable to pay instead of reorganizing their debt and trying to hang onto their homes.21
Business Bankruptcies
Businesses can also go bankrupt for a variety of reasons—mismanagement, plunging 
sales, an inability to keep up with changes in the marketplace. Under Chapter 11 a firm 
may reorganize and develop a plan to repay its debts. Chapter 11 also permits prepackaged 
bankruptcies, in which companies enter bankruptcy proceedings after obtaining approval 
of most—but not necessarily all—of their creditors. Often companies can emerge from 
prepackaged bankruptcies sooner than those that opt for conventional Chapter 11 filings. 
Airlines have managed to accomplish this, as well as some large retailers.
Tax Law
A branch of law that affects every business, employee, and consumer in the United 
States is tax law. A tax is an assessment by a governmental unit. Federal, state, and local 
governments and special taxing authorities all levy taxes. Appendix C, “Personal Financial 
Planning,” also covers tax law. 
Some taxes are paid by individuals and some by businesses. Both have a decided impact 
on contemporary business. Business taxes reduce profits, and personal taxes cut the dispos-
able incomes that individuals can spend on the products of industry. Governments spend the 
revenue from taxes to buy goods and services produced by businesses. Governments also act 
as transfer agents, moving tax revenue to other consumers and transferring Social Security 
taxes from the working population to retired or disabled people.
Governments can levy taxes on several different bases: income, sales, business receipts, 
property, and assets. The type of tax varies from one taxing authority to the other. The indi-
vidual income tax is the biggest source of revenue for the federal government. Many states 
also rely heavily on income taxes as well as sales taxes, which vary widely. Cities and towns 
may collect property taxes in order to operate schools and improve roads. So-called luxury 
taxes are levied on items like yachts and expensive sports cars, while sin taxes are levied on 
items such as cigarettes and alcohol. During the past decade, the issue of whether to tax dif-
ferent types of Internet services and use has been hotly debated.

Insurance and Risk

Tennessee Residents Under Water Without Insurance
Nashville looked like a set for a disaster movie: muddy water lapping at the stage of the Grand 
Old Opry, the nearby Opryland resort drowned and deserted, cars immersed to their windows, 
bedraggled citizens wading through the streets. But the disaster was real. In one spring weekend, 
a record 14 inches of rain fell on the city and surrounding areas, causing the Cumberland River to 
crest nearly 28 feet above flood level, resulting in major flood damage. More than 11,000 proper-
ties sustained a total of $2 billion in direct damage from the floods; Nashville alone sustained 
$1 billion in damage. But those numbers don’t take into account lost businesses, lost jobs, and lost 
possessions. Nor do they include the estimated cost to clean up and repair the public infrastruc-
ture, buildings, and overtime for city workers—which ultimately could run more than $250 million. 
Nashville alone sustained $1 billion in damage.
As the waters receded, Tennessee residents expressed gratitude to be alive or uninjured. They 
located relatives and pets, and began the grim task of mopping up what was left of their homes 
and possessions. But most soon discovered that rebuilding was going to be a gargantuan task, if 
not impossible—they didn’t have flood insurance. In fact, only 1.5 percent of all homes in the 
counties surrounding Nashville were covered by flood insurance. Most homeowners who had

Risk is a daily fact of life for both indi-
viduals and businesses. Sometimes it appears 
in the form of a serious illness or injury. In 
other instances, it takes the form of prop-
erty loss, such as the extensive damage to 
homes and businesses due to the floods in 
Nashville. Risk can also occur as the result of 
the actions of others—such as a driver who 
busy texting while running a stop sign. In 
still other cases, risk may occur as a result of 
our own actions—we might venture out in a 
boat during a thunderstorm or fail to heed 
warnings about high blood pressure.
Businesspeople must understand the 
types of risk they face and develop methods 
for dealing with them. One approach to risk 
is to shift it to the specialized expertise of 
insurance companies. This appendix dis-
cusses the concept of insurance in a business 
setting. It begins with a definition of risk. 
We then describe the various ways in which 
risk can be managed. Next, we list some of 
the major insurance concepts, such as what 
constitutes an insurable risk. The appendix 
concludes with an overview of the major 
types of insurance.

Overview
 purchased it did so because their mortgage lenders required it. Many of those who didn’t 
had asked lenders, real estate agents, and builders about flood insurance but were reassured 
that they didn’t need it, despite their proximity to a major river. “They all said, “You’re not 
in a flood plain, so you don’t need it,’” recalled one homeowner who had to leave her house 
in a rescue boat with her dog. This means that the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) and personal savings—if any—would foot the repair bills for these homewoners. 
Insurance companies with customers who were covered would be paying out large claims.
How can something like this happen? If flood insurance is not required by a lender, it’s 
an added expense to homeowners. Insurance rates can vary greatly, and flood insurance isn’t 
blanket coverage—for example, personal belongings in a flooded basement wouldn’t gener-
ally be covered, and that water entering the home has to be from the flood itself (not rain-
water or a burst pipe). In essence, flood insurance is a gamble both for the homeowner and 
the insurer. It’s also a gamble for the mortgage holder. Still, FEMA points out that having 
flood insurance is better than not having it. “Anyone who has flood insurance is way ahead 
of the game,” says Eugene Brezany, public affairs officer for FEMA. “FEMA’s assistance is 
designed to get people back on their feet, not to bring people to their pre-disaster condi-
tions.” For example, if a homeowner has a $150,000 flood insurance policy and the house 
sustains $120,000 in damage, it can be restored. Without the policy, the homeowner is out 
of pocket $120,000 minus the $5,000 or $10,000 FEMA might contribute.
All of this boils down to a calculated risk: Will there be a flood? If so, how bad will it 
be? How much will it cost to repair the damage? Insurance companies use complex formulas 
to calculate the risks associated with natural disasters. Homeowners must decide whether it’s 
worth paying expensive premiums for coverage if a flood never occurs. After the Nashville 
flood, both sides—homeowners and insurance companies—would be reexamining their posi-
tion. Meanwhile, residents who could return to their homes would salvage what they could. 
“You have to laugh to keep from crying,” said one homeowner. That outlook might well 
apply to the insurance companies too.1

Appendix B
The Concept of Risk
Risk is uncertainty about loss or injury. Consider the risks faced by a typical business. A 
factory or warehouse faces the risk of fire and smoke, burglary, and storm damage. Data loss, 
injuries to workers, and loss of facilities are some of the risks faced by businesses. Risks can 
be divided into two major categories: speculative risk and pure risk.
Speculative risk gives the firm or individual the chance of either a profit or a loss. A 
firm that expands operations into a new market may experience higher profits or the loss of 
invested funds. A contractor who builds a house without a specific buyer may sell the house 
at a profit or lose money if the house sits unsold for months.
Pure risk, on the other hand, involves only the chance of loss. Motorists, for example, 
always face the risk of accidents. If they occur, both financial and physical losses may result. 
If they do not occur, however, drivers do not profit. Insurance often helps individuals and 
businesses protect against financial loss resulting from some types of pure risk.
Risk Management
Because risk is an unavoidable part of business, managers must find ways to deal with it. 
The first step in any risk management plan is to recognize what’s at risk and why it’s at 
risk. After that, the manager must decide how to handle the risk. In general, businesses have 
four alternatives in handling risk: avoid it, minimize it, assume it, or transfer it.
Executives must consider many factors when evaluating risks, both at home and 
abroad. These factors include a nation’s economic stability; social and cultural factors, 
such as language; available technologies; distribution systems; and government regulations. 
International businesses are typically exposed to less risk in countries with stable economic, 
social and cultural, and political and legal environments.
Avoiding Risk
Some of the pure risks facing people can be avoided by living a healthful life. Not smok-
ing and not swimming alone are two ways of avoiding personal risk. By the same token, 
businesses can also avoid some of the pure risks they face. A manufacturer can locate a new 
production facility away from an area that is prone to hurricanes or tornadoes.
Reducing Risk
Managers can reduce or even eliminate many types of risk by removing hazards or tak-
ing preventive measures. Many companies develop safety programs to educate employees 
about potential hazards and the proper methods of performing certain dangerous tasks. 
Any employee who works at a hazardous waste site is required to have training and medical 
monitoring that meet the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
standards. The training and monitoring not only reduce risk but pay off on the bottom line. 
Aside from the human tragedy, accidents cost companies time and money.
Although many actions can reduce the risk involved in business operations, they cannot 
eliminate risk entirely. Most major insurers help their clients avoid or minimize risk by offer-
ing the services of loss-prevention experts to conduct thorough reviews of their operations.

risks to its survival.

These health and safety professionals evaluate customers’ work environments and recommend 
procedures and equipment to help firms minimize worker injuries and property losses.
By the same token, people can take actions to reduce risk. For instance, obeying the 
rules of the road and doing regular maintenance on a car can reduce the risks associated with 
driving. Boarding up windows in preparation for a hurricane can reduce the risk of wind 
damage. Taking these actions, however, can’t entirely eliminate risk.
Self-Insuring Against Risk
Instead of purchasing insurance against certain types of pure risk, some companies 
accumulate funds to cover potential losses. These self-insurance funds are special funds 
 created by periodically setting aside cash reserves that the firm can draw on in the event of 
a financial loss resulting from a pure risk. A firm makes regular payments to the fund, and 
it charges losses to the fund. Such a fund typically accompanies a risk-reduction program 
aimed at minimizing losses.
One of the most common forms of self-insurance is employee health insurance. Most 
employers provide health insurance coverage to employees as a component of their fringe 
benefit programs. Many, especially larger ones, find it more economical to create a self-
insurance fund covering projected employee healthcare expenses, as opposed to purchasing 
a health insurance policy from a health insurance company, like Indiana-based WellPoint. 
Self-insured employers, however, almost always contract with a health insurer to administer 
their employee health plans.
Shifting Risk to an Insurance Company
Although organizations and individuals can take steps to avoid or reduce risk, the most 
common method of dealing with it is to shift it to others in the form of insurance—a con-
tract by which an insurer, for a fee, agrees to reimburse another firm or individual a sum 
of money if a loss occurs. The insured party’s fee to the insurance company for coverage 
against losses is called a premium. Insurance substitutes a small, known loss—the insurance 
premium—for a larger, unknown loss that may or may not occur. In the case of life insur-
ance, the loss—death—is a certainty; the main uncertainty is the date when it will occur.
It is important for the insurer to understand the customer’s business, risk exposure, and 
insurance needs. Firms that operate in several countries usually do business with insurance 
companies that maintain global networks of offices.
Basic Insurance Concepts
Figure B.1 illustrates how an insurance company operates. The insurer collects premi-
ums from policyholders in exchange for insurance coverage. The insurance company uses 
some of these funds to pay current claims and operating expenses. What’s left over is held in 
the form of reserves, which are in turn invested. Reserves can be used to pay for unexpected 
losses. The returns from insurance company reserves may allow the insurer to reduce pre-
miums, generate profits, or both. By investing reserves, the insurance industry represents a 
major source of long-term financing for other businesses.
An insurance company is a professional risk taker. For a fee, it accepts risks of loss or 
damage to businesses and individuals. Four basic principles underlie insurance: the concept

loss occurs.

of insurable interest, the concept of insurable 
risk, the rule of indemnity, and the law of large 
numbers.
Insurable Interest
To purchase insurance, an applicant must 
demonstrate an insurable interest in the property 
or life of the insured. In other words, the poli-
cyholder must stand to suffer a loss, financial or 
otherwise, due to fire, storm damage, accident, 
theft, illness, death, or lawsuit. A homeowner 
has an insurable interest in his or her home and 
its contents. In the case of life insurance cover-
age purchased for the main income provider in 
a household, the policyholder’s spouse and chil-
dren have a clear insurable interest.
A firm can purchase property and liability 
insurance on physical assets—such as an office 
or warehouse—to cover losses due to such haz-
ards as fire and theft because the company can 
demonstrate an obvious insurable interest. Because top executives are important assets to a 
company, a business often purchases key-person life insurance, which compensates the busi-
ness should an important individual die.
Insurable Risk
Insurable risk refers to the requirements that a risk must meet in order for the insurer to 
provide protection. Only some pure risks, and no speculative ones, are insurable. There are 
four basic requirements for a pure risk to be considered an insurable risk:
1. The likelihood of loss should be reasonably predictable. If an insurance company cannot 
reasonably predict losses, it has no basis for setting affordable premiums.
2. The loss should be financially measurable.
3. The loss should be accidental, or fortuitous.
4. The risk should be spread over a certain geographic area.
The insurance company has the right to set standards for accepting risk. This process of 
setting these standards, and deciding what to charge, is known as underwriting.
Rule of Indemnity
The rule of indemnity states that the insured cannot collect more than the amount 
of the loss. Nor can the insured collect for that loss more than once. Assume that a florist’s 
delivery van is damaged in an accident. If the total damage amounts to $2,500, then that is 
the maximum amount the business can collect from the insurance company.
Occasionally a loss may be covered by more than one policy. For instance, assume that 
a $5,000 loss is covered by two different policies. The rule of indemnity means that the 
rule of indemnity 
requirement that the 
insured cannot collect more 
than the amount of the loss 
and cannot collect for the 
same loss more than once.

insured individual or business can only collect a total of $5,000 from both insurance compa-
nies. It is up to the insurers to decide which pays how much based on policy specifics.
The Law of Large Numbers
Insurance is based on the law of averages, or statistical probability. Insurance companies 
simply cannot afford to sell insurance policies unless they can reasonably predict losses. As 
a result, insurance companies have studied the chances of occurrences of deaths, injuries, 
property damage, lawsuits, and other types of hazards. Table B.1 is an example of the kind 
of data insurance companies examine. It shows the automobile accident rate, by the age of 
the driver, for a recent year. From their investigations, insurance companies have developed 
actuarial tables, which predict the number of fires, automobile accidents, or deaths that 
will occur in a given year. Premiums charged for insurance coverage are based on these 
tables. Actuarial tables are based on the law of large numbers. In essence, the law of large 
numbers states that seemingly random events will follow a predictable pattern if enough 
events are observed.

Appendix B
An example can demonstrate how insurers use 
the law of large numbers to calculate premiums. 
Previously collected statistical data on a city with 
50,000 homes indicates that the city will experience 
an average of 500 fires a year, with damages averag-
ing $30,000 per occurrence. What is the minimum 
annual premium an insurance company would charge 
to insure one residence?
To simplify the calculations, assume that the 
premiums would not produce profits or cover any of 
the insurance company’s operating expenses—they 
would just produce enough income to pay policyhold-
ers for their losses. In total, fires in the city would 
generate claims of $15 million (500 homes damaged 
 $30,000). If these losses were spread over all 50,000 
homes, each home-owner would be charged an annual 
premium of $300 ($15 million  50,000 homes). In 
reality, though, the insurer would set the premium 
at a higher figure to cover operating expenses, build 
reserves, and earn a reasonable profit. For instance, 
during a recent year, the  purchase of individual life 
insurance policies totaled $10 trillion in premiums, but 
the payout of claims was less.2
Some losses are easier for insurance companies to predict than others. Life insurance 
companies can predict with high accuracy the number of policyholders who will die within a 
specified period of time. But losses from such hazards as automobile accidents and weather 
events are much more difficult to predict. For example, the number of damage claims on 
homeowners’ policies due to lightning has increased dramatically. During one recent year, 
more than 185,000 claims were made, costing insurers nearly $800 million.3
Sources of Insurance Coverage
The insurance industry includes both for-profit companies—such as Prudential, State 
Farm, and Liberty Mutual—and a number of public agencies that provide insurance cover-
age for business firms, not-for-profit organizations, and individuals.
Public Insurance Agencies
A public insurance agency is a state or federal government unit established to provide spe-
cialized insurance protection for individuals and organizations. It provides protection in such 
areas as job loss (unemployment insurance) and work-related injuries (workers’ compensa-
tion). Public insurance agencies also sponsor specialized programs, such as deposit, flood, 
and crop insurance.
Unemployment Insurance Every state in the U.S. has an unemployment 
insurance program that assists unemployed workers by providing financial benefits, job 
counseling, and placement services. Compensation amounts vary depending on workers’ pre-
vious incomes and the states in which they file claims. These insurance programs are funded 
by payroll taxes paid by employers.
Office of the State Actuary
Actuarial tables are based on the law of large numbers. These tables can show 
the current life expectancy for men and women. Actuarial tables can be found, as 
shown in the Web page above, from the Office of the State Actuary. This shows 
the Web site for the state of Washington.

A-25
Appendix B
Workers’ Compensation Under state laws, employers must provide workers’ 
compensation insurance to guarantee payment of wages and salaries, medical care costs, and 
such rehabilitation services as retraining, job placement, and vocational rehabilitation to 
employees who are injured on the job. In addition, workers’ compensation provides benefits 
in the form of weekly payments or single, lump-sum payments to survivors of workers who 
die as a result of work-related injuries. Premiums are based on the company’s payroll, the 
on-the-job hazards to which it exposes workers, and its safety record.
Social Security The federal government is the nation’s largest insurer. The Social 
Security program, established in 1935, provides retirement, survivor, and disability benefits 
to millions of Americans. Medicare was added to the Social Security program in 1965 to 
provide health insurance for people age 65 and older and certain other Social Security recip-
ients. More than nine out of ten workers in the United States and their dependents are eli-
gible for Social Security program benefits. The program is funded through a payroll tax, half 
of which is paid by employers and half by workers. Self-employed people pay the full tax.
Private Insurance Companies
Much of the insurance in force is provided by private firms. These companies provide 
protection in exchange for the payment of premiums. Some private insurers are stockholder 
owned, and therefore are run like any other business, and others are so-called mutual asso-
ciations. Most, though not all, mutual insurance companies specialize in life insurance. 
Technically, mutual insurance companies are owned by their policyholders, who may receive 
premium rebates in the form of dividends. In spite of this, however, there is no evidence 
that an insurance policy from a mutual company costs any less than a comparable policy 
from a stockholder-owned insurer. In recent years some mutual insurance companies have 
reorganized as stockholder-owned companies, including Prudential, one of the nation’s 
largest insurers.
Types of Insurance
Individuals and businesses spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year on insur-
ance coverage. Figure B.2 shows how much insurance companies collected in premiums for 
selected types of insurance in a recent year. Unfortunately, both business firms and consum-
ers make poor decisions when buying insurance. Here are four commonsense tips to remem-
ber when buying insurance:
1. Insure against large losses, not small ones. It is generally much more cost effective to self-
insure against small losses.
2. Buy insurance with broad coverage, not narrow coverage. For example, it is much less 
expensive generally to buy a homeowners policy that protects you from multiple events 
(perils such as fire and theft) than to buy several policies that cover individual events.
3. Shop around. Premiums for similar policies can vary widely from company to company.
4. Buy insurance only from financially strong companies. Insurance companies occasionally 
go bankrupt. If that happens, the insured is left with no coverage and little hope of getting 
premiums back.
Although insurers offer hundreds of different policies, they all fall into three broad cat-
egories: property and liability insurance, health and disability insurance, and life insurance.

Appendix B
 various perils. If a home is destroyed by fire, for example, the home-owners’ policy will pay 
to replace the home and its contents. Virtually all homeowners carry coverage of this nature.
Homeowners’ insurance premiums have risen sharply in recent years. Moreover, home-
owners in coastal areas are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain insurance because of the 
rising number of claims related to erosion, hurricanes, and floods. If homeowners can obtain 
private coverage, those plans may be very expensive. In some cases they may be able to pur-
chase insurance through a state-run program instead.4
Although standard policies cover a wide range of perils, most do not cover damage from 
widespread catastrophes such as floods and earthquakes. Homeowners must purchase sepa-
rate policies to protect against damage caused by these perils. Flood insurance is available 
through the National Flood Insurance Program. Earthquake coverage is offered in several 
earthquake-prone states such as California and Washington but is very expensive.
Auto Insurance With more than $150 billion in annual premiums, automobile 
insurance is the country’s largest category of property and liability insurance. Automobile insur-
ance policies cover losses due to automobile accidents or theft, including personal and prop-
erty claims. Almost all states require drivers to have a minimum amount of auto 
insurance coverage.
Commercial and Business Insurance Commercial and business insur-
ance protects firms from financial losses resulting from the suspension of business opera-
tions (business interruption insurance) or physical damage to property as a result of destructive 
events. These policies may also protect employers from employee dishonesty or losses result-
ing from nonperformance of contracts.
Liability Insurance Liability insurance protects an individual or business against 
financial losses to others for which the individual or business was responsible. If a busi-
ness sells a defective product, the firm’s liability insurance would pay for financial losses 
sustained by customers. A standard amount of liability coverage is usually attached to auto, 
homeowners’, and commercial insurance policies. Additional amounts of liability insurance 
can be purchased if needed. Adequate liability insurance is critically important today for both 
 businesses and individuals. Walmart, for example, requires its suppliers to have at least

Property and Liability 
Insurance
Insurance that protects against 
fire, accident, theft, or other destructive 
events, or perils, is called property and 
liability insurance. Examples of this 
insurance category include homeowners’ 
insurance, auto insurance, business or 
commercial insurance, and liability 
insurance. Most property and liability 
policies are subject to deductibles. 
A deductible is the amount of the 
loss the insured pays out of pocket.

Health and Disability Insurance
Each of us faces the risk of getting sick or being injured in some way. Even a relatively 
minor illness can result in substantial healthcare bills. To guard against this risk, most 
Americans have some form of health insurance—insurance that provides coverage for 
expenses due to sickness or accidents. With soaring costs in health care, this type of insur-
ance has become an important consideration for both businesses and individuals.
Sources of health insurance include private individual policies, private group poli-
cies, and the federal government, through Medicare and Medicaid (health insurance for 
lower-income people). More than 60 percent of Americans are covered by private group 
health insurance provided by their employer as an employee benefit. Four of every five U.S. 
employees work for businesses and not-for-profits that offer some form of group health 
insurance. Group policies resemble individual health insurance policies but are offered at 
lower premiums. Individual health insurance policies are simply too expensive for most 
people. Health insurance costs have soared in recent years, and employers have responded 
by cutting back on benefits, requiring employees to pay more of the premium, charging 
higher deductibles, or even dropping coverage altogether. In response to the growing cost 
and increasing numbers of individuals without adequate coverage, Congress passed a pair 
of healthcare reform bills entitled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the 
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. Although the bills were the subject of 
heated debate among legislators, businesspeople, and consumers, they were signed into 
law in 2010.6
Private health insurance plans fall into one of two general 
categories: fee-for-service plans and managed care plans. In a 
fee-for-service plan, the insured picks his or her doctor and has almost 
unlimited access to specialists. Fee-for-service plans charge an annual 
deductible and copayments. By contrast, a managed care plan pays 
most of the insured’s healthcare bills. In return, the program has a 
great deal of say over the conditions of healthcare provided for the 
insured. Most managed care plans, for example, restrict the use of 
specialists and may specify which hospitals and pharmacies can be 
used. Some employers offer employees a choice between a fee-for-
service and a managed care plan. Multiple managed care plans are 
sometimes available.
Managed care plans have become extremely popular in recent 
years. More than 150 million Americans are enrolled in some form of 
managed care plan, and many fee-for-service plans have adopted some 
elements of managed care. A primary reason for the popularity of man-
aged care is simply cost: managed care plans generally cost employers 
and employees less than fee-for-service plans. Managed care, however, 
is not without its critics. The effort to control costs has caused a back-
lash because of restrictions placed on doctors and patients. Legislation 
at both the federal and state level has forced managed care plans to give 
patients and physicians more control over medical decisions.
Types of Managed Care Plans Two types of 
managed care plans can be found in the United States: health 
health insurance cate-
gory of insurance that pays 
for losses due to illness or 
injury.

maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations. Although both manage 
health care, important differences exist between the two.
Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) do not provide health insurance, they pro-
vide health care. An HMO supplies all of the individual’s healthcare needs, including pre-
scription drugs and hospitalization. The individual must use the HMO’s own doctors and 
approved treatment facilities in order to receive benefits. Doctors and other healthcare pro-
fessionals are actually employees of the HMO. Individuals pick a primary care physician and 
cannot see a specialist without a referral. An HMO charges no deductibles and only a low, 
fixed-dollar copayment.
The second type of managed care plan is the preferred provider organization (PPO). 
In the United States, more individuals are covered by PPOs than by HMOs. A PPO is 
an arrangement in which an employer negotiates a contract between local healthcare 
providers (physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies) to provide medical care to its employ-
ees at a discount. These plans have low fixed-dollar copayments. They are generally 
much more flexible than HMOs. Members can choose their primary care physician from 
a list of doctors. If a referral is given or hospitalization is required, the member again 
chooses from a list of approved healthcare providers. A member who obtains treatment 
from a healthcare provider outside the PPO network may be reimbursed for only part of 
the cost.
Disability Income Insurance Not only is disability income insurance one of 
the most overlooked forms of insurance, but many workers don’t have enough coverage. 
The odds of a person developing a disability are considerably higher than most people 
 realize. Take a group of five randomly selected 45-year-olds. There is approximately a 95 
percent chance that one of the five will develop some form of a disability during the next 20 
years. Disability income insurance is designed to replace lost income when a wage earner 
 cannot work due to an accident or illness.
Two sources of disability income insurance exist: Social Security and private disability 
insurance policies. Social Security disability benefits are available to virtually all workers, 
but they have very strict requirements. Private disability insurance is available on either 
an individual or group basis. As with health insurance, a group policy is much cheaper 
than an individual policy. Many employers provide at least some disability coverage as an 
employee benefit. Employees often have the option of obtaining additional coverage by 
paying more.
Life Insurance
Life insurance protects people against the financial losses that occur with premature 
death. Three of every four Americans have some form of life insurance. The main reason 
people buy life insurance is to provide financial security for their families in the event of 
their death. With assets totaling more than $4 trillion, the life insurance industry is one of 
the nation’s largest businesses.
Types of Life Insurance As with health and disability insurance, both indi-
vidual and group life insurance policies are available. Many employers offer life insurance 
to employees as a component of the firm’s benefit program. However, unlike health and 
disability insurance, an individual life insurance policy is usually cheaper than a group 
policy for younger people.
The different types of life insurance fall neatly into two categories: term policies 
and cash value policies. Term policies provide a death benefit if the policyholder dies

people against the financial 
losses that occur with pre-
mature death.

Appendix B
within a specified period of time. It has no value at 
the end of that period. Cash value policies—sometimes 
called whole life and universal life— combine life insur-
ance protection with a savings or investment feature. 
The cash value represents the amount of the savings 
or investment portion of the policy. Although there 
are arguments in favor of cash value policies, many 
experts believe that term life insurance is a better choice 
for most consumers. For one thing, a term policy is 
much cheaper than a cash value policy.
How Much Life Insurance Should 
You Have? People can purchase life insurance 
 policies for almost any amount. Life insurance purchases 
are limited only by the amount of premiums people can 
afford and their ability to meet medical qualifications. 
The amount of life insurance a person needs, however, 
is a very personal decision. The general rule of thumb is 
that a person needs life insurance if he or she has family 
members who financially depend on that individual. A 
young parent with three small children could easily need 
$500,000 or more of life insurance. A single person with 
no dependents would reasonably see little or no need 
for a life insurance policy.
Businesses, as well as individual consumers, buy 
life insurance. The death of a  partner or a key executive is likely to result in a financial 
loss to an organization. Key person insurance reimburses the organization for the loss of 
the services of an essential senior executive and to cover the executive search expenses 
needed to find a replacement. In addition, life insurance policies may be purchased for 
each member of a partnership to be able to repay the deceased partner’s survivors for his 
or her share of the firm and permit the business to continue.

Among other benefits, many businesses offer life insurance to their employees. 
Although groups usually get a better deal on insurance than individuals, young 
employees may do better with an individual insurance policy.

Personal Financial 
Planning
The CARD Trick: Will It Work?
In one recent student-loan survey of college graduates, nearly half said they wished they had 
learned more in college about managing their finances—credit cards in particular. The average 
college student has 4.6 credit cards with more than $3,000 in balances—and that’s in addition to 
any outstanding student loans. Only 17 percent of college students pay off their card balances in 
full each month, meaning that a lot of them are racking up debt, interest charges, and fees. Critics 
of the credit card industry point fingers at card issuers that advertise on campus, literally handing 
out credit cards along with free promotional items such as backpacks, T-shirts, and water bottles. 
While the water bottles and T-shirts don’t accrue debt, the credit cards do.
Congress has decided that this represents a financial crisis, in which students graduate from 
college with significant debt in addition to their student loans—some topping $10,000 or more. 
The CARD Act, which was signed into law in 2010, contains reforms aimed at curbing the access 
credit card companies have to stu-
dents as well as the amount of credit 
students can actually obtain. Under 
the new law, credit card issuers are 
prohibited from offering free entice-
ments such as T-shirts and teddy 
bears. In addition, firms may not 
market their cards within 1,000 feet 
of a college campus or at a college-
sponsored event. They must maintain 
more transparent communication with 
students and with colleges, disclos-
ing the terms of their agreements. 
Students will have a tougher time 
actually obtaining credit cards; those 
under age 21 must have adult co-sign-
ers or prove they earn enough income 
to make payments.
Some applaud the restrictions 
imposed by the new law, while oth-
ers find it too restrictive. “It’s my 
safety line,” says one student who 
happens to have a good summer job 
and can maintain the card. “I use my 
credit card for everything, from gas 
to my books to my food and clothes.” 
Another college student observes that 
the credit limit should be  appropriate

apply to your personal life. For instance, you 
learn about each of the important functions 
of a business—from accounting to market-

about each business function will help you 
choose a career, and a career choice is one 
of the most important personal financial 
decisions you will make. You will learn why 
firms prepare budgets and financial state-

Everyone, regardless of age or income, 
can probably do a better job of managing 
his or her finances. As a group, Americans 
are much better at making money than 
they are at managing money. This appendix

deals with a variety of issues and decisions 
that affect a person’s financial well-being. 
It includes basic money management, 
credit, tax planning, major consumer pur-

to a student’s income and age. “I agree there should be new standards in place. Freshman 
shouldn’t get credit limits of $5,000. However, I don’t agree that it should be difficult for 
them to get credit at all.” Others point out that finding a co-signer to put his or her credit 
score on the line may be difficult.
But many adults and students agree that in general the steps taken by the CARD Act 
are positive ones. “I think it’s going to keep a lot of students from getting into trouble,” says 
Irene Leach, associate professor in consumer studies at Virginia Tech University. “I hope it 
means we’ll have more responsible lending and parents don’t get surprised that a young per-
son has taken out this debt.” And there are alternatives to the traditional credit card. College 
students can piggyback on their parents’ cards simply by having parents add their name to 
the card account—that way, parents can monitor the credit card spending done by their chil-
dren. Or students can apply for prepaid cards, which are similar to bank debit cards. While 
these may come with unattractive fees, Visa and other companies make regular reports to 
credit bureaus, a practice that helps students build a good credit standing without getting 
into debt.
Perhaps students themselves make the most compelling argument for credit card reform. 
One student who got her first credit card while in college and accumulated more than 
$7,500 in debt has “regretted it ever since.”1

The Meaning and Importance 
of Personal Finance
Personal finance is the study of the economic factors and personal decisions that affect a 
person’s financial well-being. Personal finance affects, and is affected by, many things we do 
and many decisions we make throughout our lives.
On one level, personal finance involves money know-how. It is essential to know how 
to earn money, as well as how to save, spend, invest, and control it in order to achieve goals. 
The reward of sound money management is an improvement in a person’s standard of living. 
Standard of living consists of the necessities, comforts, or luxuries a person seeks to attain 
or maintain.
On another level, personal finance is intertwined with each person’s lifestyle—the way 
we live our daily lives. Our choice of careers, friends, hobbies, communities, and possessions 
is determined by personal finances, and yet our personal finances can also be determined by 
our lifestyles. If you’re a college student living on a shoestring budget, you may have to make 
serious financial sacrifices to achieve your educational goals. Where you live is determined 
by what school you attend and how much you can afford to pay for room and board; your 
vacation is set by your academic schedule and your savings account; your clothing depends 
on the climate and your budget. All these lifestyle decisions are largely determined by your 
personal finances.
The Importance of Personal Finance Today
Good money management has always been important, but major changes in the eco-
nomic environment over the past few years have made personal finance even more important 
today. And this is true whether you’re a 20-year-old college 
student with hefty tuition bills, a 40-year-old parent with a 
mortgage to pay, or a 60-year-old thinking about retirement. 
Let’s look at three reasons personal financial planning is so 
important in today’s environment.
Sluggish Growth in Personal 
Income Personal income in the United States has grown 
very slowly in recent years. For example, median household 
income actually fell 3.6 percent in a recent year.2 This was 
during the time when the U.S. economy was experiencing 
significant difficulty as financial institutions faltered and 
unemployment soared. While the economy is now moving 
forward, most predict that annual increases in wages and 
salaries will barely keep pace with the rate of inflation in the 
coming years.
The sluggish growth in personal income makes sound 
money management very important. You cannot count on 
rising personal income by itself to improve your standard of 
living. Rather, you need to save and invest more money, stick 
to a budget, and make major purchases wisely.

Changes in the Labor Market Job security and the notion of work have 
changed in recent years. The traditional model of working for the same company for 
one’s entire career is very rare today. The average tenure of employment in one job is 
five years.3
The fact is you and your classmates will likely change jobs and even employers several 
times during your careers. Some will end up working part-time or on a contract basis, with 
little job security and fewer benefits. Others will take time off to care for small children or 
elderly parents. And a goal many people have today is to start their own business and work 
for themselves.
Furthermore, it is estimated that one in four workers today will be unemployed at some 
point during their working lives. You never know when your employer will “downsize,” tak-
ing your job with it, or “outsource” your job to someone else. Just review today’s headlines, 
and you will see that announcements of prominent companies downsizing and outsourcing 
are common.
These changes make sound personal financial management even more important. You 
must keep your career skills up-to-date and accumulate sufficient financial resources to 
weather an unexpected crisis.
More Options The number of choices today in such areas as banking, credit, 
investments, and retirement planning can be bewildering. Today you can do most of your 
banking with a brokerage firm and then buy mutual fund shares at a bank. Even the simple 
checking account has become more complicated. The typical bank offers several different 
types of checking accounts, each with its own features and fees. Choosing the wrong account 
could easily cost you $100 or more in unnecessary fees each year.
Twenty years ago, few college students carried credit cards, and those who did typically 
had cards tied to their parents’ accounts. Banks and other credit card issuers didn’t consider 
college students to be reasonable risks. Then the situation changed, resulting in a credit card 
debt crisis among students, as described at the beginning of this appendix. The CARD Act 
however, contains reforms aimed at reversing this trend so that students will become more 
educated about their use of money.
One of the first things you’ll do when you start a full-time job is make decisions about 
employee benefits. The typical employer may offer lots of choices in such areas as health 
insurance, disability insurance, group life insurance, and retirement plans. Selecting the right 
health insurance plan can save you thousands of dollars each year; by the same token, choos-
ing the right retirement plan will enhance your security many years from now.
Personal Financial Planning—
A Lifelong Activity
Personal financial planning is as important an activity whether you’re 20, 40, or 60; 
whether you’re single or married with children; and whether your annual income is $20,000 
or $200,000. Many experts say that if you can’t stick to a budget and control your spending 
when you’re making $25,000 a year, you’ll find it difficult to live within your means even if 
your income doubles or triples.
The fact that sound planning is a lifelong activity, of course, doesn’t mean your financial 
goals and plans remain the same throughout your life—they won’t. The major goal when 
you’re young may be to buy your first condominium or pay off your college loans. For older 
people, the major goal is to pay off their home mortgage and stockpile as much in retirement 
funds as possible.

Appendix C
A Personal Financial 
Management Model
A financial plan is a guide to help you reach targeted goals in the future, closing the 
gap between where you are currently and where you’d like to be in the future. Goals might 
include buying a home, starting your own business, traveling extensively, sending children 
to college, or retiring early. Developing a personal financial plan consists of several steps, as 
illustrated in Figure C.1.
The first step in the process is to establish a clear picture of where you currently stand 
financially. Next, develop a series of short- and long-term goals. These goals should be 
influenced by your values, as well as an assessment of your current financial situation. The 
next step is to establish a set of financial strategies—in each of the personal planning areas—
designed to help close the gap between where you are now and where you want to be in the 
future. Next, put your plan into action and closely monitor its performance. Periodically 
evaluate the effectiveness of your financial plan and make adjustments when necessary.
Financial plans cannot be developed in a vacuum. They should reflect your available 
resources—especially salary and fringe benefits, such as health insurance and retirement 
plans. For example, your goals and financial strategies should be based on a realistic estimate 
of your future income. If you cannot reach your financial goals through your present career 
path, you will have to scale back your goals or consider switching careers.
In addition, external factors—such as eco-
nomic conditions and employment prospects—will 
influence your financial plan and decisions. For 
instance, assume you currently rent an apartment 
but have a goal of buying a home. While you can 
afford to buy a home right now, you believe there 
is a good chance you’ll be offered a much better 
job in a new city within the next year. A wise finan-
cial move might be to postpone buying a home 
until your employment future becomes clearer.
General Themes Common 
to All Financial Plans
Regardless of the specifics, all financial plans 
revolve around three general themes: (1) maximiz-
ing income and wealth, (2) using money more 
effectively, and (3) monitoring expenditures.
Maximizing Income and 
Wealth Maximizing your income and wealth 
means getting more money. Work smarter; seek 
retraining for a better, higher-paying job; take 
career risks that may pay off in the long run; make 
sound investment decisions—all these are exam-
ples of the implementation of the first step. The 
amount of money you earn is a vital part of any 
financial plan, and it is up to you to make the most 
of your opportunities.

Appendix C
Using Money More Effectively Money has two 
basic uses: consumption and savings. Even if you are a regular 
saver, you’ll still spend most of your income, probably more 
than 90 percent. You must try to spend every dollar wisely and 
make every major buying decision part of your overall financial 
plan. Avoid impulsive spending or giving in to a hard sell.
And it’s not just big expenditures you need to watch. 
Cutting back your spending on small items can make a differ-
ence. Little purchases do add up. Packing your own lunch a few 
times a week rather than buying your sandwiches at the local 
deli could save about $15 a week. Invest that savings at 3 percent 
interest (per year) and you’ll have almost $38,000 in 30 years.
Monitoring Expenditures Budgeting is the 
key to controlling expenditures. A budget focuses on where 
the money is going and whether a person’s goals are being met. It also suggests appropriate 
times for reevaluating priorities. If your budget doesn’t reflect what you want from life both 
now and in the future, change it.
Information also helps you keep your expenditures under control. The more you know 
about real estate, consumer loans, credit-card rates and laws, insurance, taxes, and major pur-
chases, the more likely you are to spend the least money to purchase the greatest value.
The Pitfalls of Poor Financial Planning
Unfortunately, too many people fail to plan effectively for their financial future. Not 
only do many find it difficult to improve their standard of living, but quite a few also find 
themselves with mounting debts and a general inability to make ends meet. Recently per-
sonal bankruptcy filings hit an all-time high of 1.41 million in one year, according to the 
National Bankruptcy Research Center.4 A related problem is foreclosure, which results when 
homeowners are unable to pay their mortgage loans.
Although there are laws in effect that generally favor consumers who run into difficulty, 
and although there are credit consolidation and counseling bureaus that help people orga-
nize and pay their debt, foreclosure and bankruptcy are generally actions of last resort and 
it’s best to avoid taking these steps.
Setting Personal Goals
Whatever your personal financial goals, they should reflect your values. Values are a 
set of fundamental beliefs of what is important, desirable, and worthwhile in your life. Your 
values will influence how you spend your money and, therefore, should be the foundation of 
your financial plan. Each person’s financial goals will be determined by the individual’s val-
ues because every individual considers some things more desirable or important than others. 
Start by asking yourself some questions about your values, the things that are most impor-
tant to you, and what you would like to accomplish in your life.
Your goals are also influenced by your current financial situation. Prepare a set of 
current financial statements for yourself and update them at least once a year. Just like a business, 
a personal income statement reflects income and expenditures during a year. A balance sheet is a 
statement of what you own (assets) and what you owe (liabilities) at a specific point in time. For 
an individual or household, the difference between assets and liabilities is called net worth. As 
shown in Figure C.2, as you accumulate assets over your life, your net worth increases.

Small expenses add up. Over time, bringing your own lunch to the 
office instead of eating out can really beef up your bank account.

A-37
Appendix C
After reviewing your current financial statements, you should prepare a 
budget. It is an excellent tool for monitoring your expenditures and cash flow 
and permits you to track past and current expenditures and plan future ones. 
Budgets are usually prepared on a monthly basis, but you can make a weekly 
budget if that works better for you. Most budgets divide expenditures into 
fixed expenses (those that don’t change much from month to month) and vari-
able expenses (those that vary). Your monthly apartment rent or your meal 
plan at school is probably a fixed expense, but the amount you spend on gas for 
your car or on entertainment is a variable expense. One key to effective bud-
geting is to make sure that the budgeted amounts are realistic.
Next, establish a series of financial goals based on your values and current 
financial situation. Separate your goals into short-term goals (those you want to 
achieve within the next six months or year) and long-term goals (those you plan 
to achieve over the next five or ten years). A short-term goal might be to pay 
off your credit card balances by the end of this year, or to save enough money 
to take a vacation next summer. A long-term goal might be to buy a house by 
age 30. Your goals are reinforced if they support each other—if you pay off 
your credit cards, you’ll likely have enough money saved to take that vacation 
or eventually buy your house. Some goals are monetary—such as paying off the 
credit card. Others are nonmonetary, such as planning to retire by age 55.
Whether short-term or long-term, monetary or nonmonetary, the best 
financial goals are defined specifically and focused on results. Goals also need 
to be realistic. You might not be able to pay off all of your credit cards by the 
end of this year, but you might pay off one. You might not buy the house by 
age 30, but maybe by 35. So be sure to set goals that you can actually attain. Keep in mind 
also that your financial goals will change over your lifetime. It’s a good idea to review them 
periodically and adjust them when necessary, such as when you lose or get a job, relocate to 
another area of the country, or have children.
Your Personal Financial Decisions
You can use financial strategies in such areas as career choice, credit management, and 
tax planning to help you chart your economic future. These strategies should reflect your 
goals and be designed to close the gap between where you are and where you want to be.
Career Choice
No factor exerts as strong an influence on your personal finances as your career choice. 
Virtually all of your income, especially when you’re just starting out, will come from wages 
and salaries. It is through work that all of us acquire the income needed to build a lifestyle; 
to buy goods and services, including insurance protection; to save and invest; and to plan 
for retirement. Your job is also the source of many important fringe benefits, such as health 
insurance and retirement savings plans, that are important components of your financial 
future. Throughout Contemporary Business, we’ve discussed ways to select a career that fits 
your skills and interests, find a job, and perform in that job.

management of more complicated financial assets such as investment and retirement accounts. You 
must choose a bank or other financial institution and then select the right checking account. Banks 
today offer several different types of checking accounts, each with its own set of features and fees.
Table C.1 lists several commonsense tips for selecting and managing a checking account. 
Managing a savings account involves understanding the importance of savings, setting sav-
ings goals, and picking the best savings option.
Credit Management
Credit is the area of personal finance that gets more people into financial difficulties 
than any other area. And Americans love credit. According to recent data from the Federal 
Reserve, Americans now owe in excess of $2.5 trillion, excluding home mortgage loans. This 
amount has almost doubled over the past ten years.5
Credit allows a person to purchase goods and services by borrowing the necessary funds 
from a lender, such as a bank. The borrower agrees to repay the loan over a specified period 
of time, paying a specified rate of interest. The finance charge is the difference between 
the amount borrowed and the amount repaid. Credit is available from many sources today, 
but rates vary, so it pays to shop around.
There are two broad types of consumer credit: revolving (or open-end) credit and 
installment credit. Revolving credit is a type of credit arrangement that enables consumers to 
make a number of different purchases up to a credit limit, specified by the lender. The con-
sumer has the option of repaying some or all of the outstanding balance each month. If the 
consumer carries a balance from month to month, finance charges (interest) are levied. An 
example of revolving credit is a credit card, such as Visa or MasterCard.
An installment loan is a credit arrangement in which the borrower takes out a loan for a 
specified amount, agreeing to repay the loan in regular installments over a specified period of 
time. Part of each payment is interest and part goes to repay principal (the amount borrowed). 
Generally, installment loan payments are made monthly and are for the same amount. Most 
student loans, auto loans, and home mortgage loans are examples of installment loans.
People have good reasons for borrowing money. They include purchasing large, important 
goods and services (cars, homes, or a college education), dealing with financial emergencies, 
credit receiving money, 
goods, or services on the 
basis of an agreement 
between the lender and 
the borrower that the loan 
is for a specified period of 
time with a specified rate 
of interest.

• Shop around. There are lots of financial institutions that offer checking accounts. Fees and services vary considerably.
•  Choose the right account for the way you bank. Consider such factors as the number of checks you write each month, 
how often you use ATMs, and your average monthly balance.
• Keep good records and regularly balance your checking account.
• Use your personal computer to pay bills electronically, balance your checkbook, and perform other banking tasks.
•  Watch how you use your ATM card. Know which ATMs are owned by your bank and how much you’re charged to use 
another bank’s ATM. Be careful when using an ATM to check your current balance.
• Notify your bank immediately if your ATM card is lost or stolen.
• Sign up for overdraft protection.
• Understand how your bank computes minimum monthly balance.
• Read the fine print in your monthly statement.

a Checking Account

taking advantage of opportunities, and establishing or improving your credit rating. All of 
these reasons are appropriate uses of credit if you can repay the loans in a timely manner.
However, a wrong reason for borrowing money is using credit to live beyond your 
means. For instance, you may want to go to Cancun for vacation but really cannot afford to, 
so you charge the trip. Using credit to live beyond your means often leads to credit prob-
lems. Watch for these warning signs of potential credit problems:
 
• You use credit to meet basic living expenses.
 • You use credit to make impulse purchases.
 • You take a cash advance on one credit card to repay another.
 • The unpaid balance on your credit cards increases month after month.
Consumers who think of credit purchases as a series of small monthly payments are 
fooling themselves. As we noted earlier, most college students have at least one credit card 
today, and more than half carry balances from month to month. The average student is 
putting $2,200 on credit cards for college expenses—including books, meals, and activi-
ties fees. Although the CARD Act is aimed at curbing this debt, college students—and 
consumers in general—must also curb their credit spending.6 How long would it take you 
to become debt free if you had $2,200 on your credit card, if you paid only the minimum 
payment each month? The answer is nearly 11 years—and you would have paid more than 
$2,000 in interest.
If you feel as though you have a problem with credit, or may be developing one, you 
should seek help as soon as possible. Your college or university may offer credit counsel-
ing services. If not, contact a local not-for-profit credit counseling service or the National 
Foundation for Credit Counseling (800-388-2227 or http://www.nfcc.org). According to the 
experts, one of the keys to the wise use of credit is education. Learning about the pros and 
cons of borrowing money, as well as learning about responsible spending, can help people 
avoid problems with credit.
Tax Planning
Everyone pays a variety of taxes to federal, state, and local governments. The major 
taxes paid by individuals include federal and state income taxes, Social Security and Medicare 
taxes, real estate taxes, and sales taxes. The median-income family paid almost 38 percent of 
its income in taxes during a recent year. Think about your own situation and the taxes you 
pay. You have federal income taxes withheld from each paycheck. In addition, if you live in 
one of the 41 states with a state income tax, you have state income tax withheld also. Social 
Security and Medicare taxes amount to a percentage of your wages split between you and 
your employer (you pay the entire amount if you’re self-employed). If you rent an apart-
ment, part of your monthly rent goes to pay the landlord’s real estate tax bill. In most states, 
every time you buy something, you pay sales tax to your state and local governments.
By law, you must pay your taxes. You can use some of the popular software such as 
TurboTax to calculate your federal and state income taxes, or have a professional handle 
them—these two options are likely to find you any legal deductions you can take. If you 
do the tax return yourself—even with the aid of software—you will learn more about your 
personal finances. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has several excellent publications to 
help you prepare a federal income tax return. One of the best is IRS Publication #17 (You 
and Your Federal Income Tax). This and all other IRS publications are available free of charge 
from local IRS offices or the IRS Web site (http://www.irs.gov).

Appendix C
Major Purchases
Even if you follow a strict budget and manage to save money regularly, you will still 
spend most of your income each year. Effective buying is an important part of your financial 
plan. Within personal budget limits, an individual exercises his or her rights as a consumer 
to select or reject the wide range of goods and services that are available. As you purchase 
an automobile, a home, or any other major item, you need to carefully evaluate alternatives, 
separate needs from wants, and determine how you are going to finance the purchase. Your 
goal is to make every dollar you spend count.
Americans spend more than $900 billion annually on transportation, most of which goes 
to purchasing and maintaining automobiles. Given that new vehicles average more than 
$20,000 today, and even good used cars can cost in excess of $14,000, buying an automo-
bile is a substantial purchase. On top of that, most car purchases are financed. Buying a car 
involves weighing many factors, including whether you want a new or used car, what makes 
and models appeal to you, and how much you can afford to pay. Many consumers today 
choose not to buy a new car but rather to lease one. While leasing has advantages, it also has 
drawbacks and, overall, is often more expensive than buying.
For most people, housing consumes a large share of their monthly budgets, whether 
in rent or mortgage payments. Home ownership is a goal of most people. Owning a home 
has a number of advantages, both financial and nonfinancial. Some of the financial benefits 
include tax savings (home mortgage interest and property taxes are both tax deductible) and 
the potential increase in the home’s value. Nonfinancial benefits include pride of owner-
ship and the freedom to improve or change the home however you want. The major bar-
rier to home ownership is the money required for a down payment, along with the income 
required to obtain a mortgage loan.
The other major housing option is renting. Renting also offers a number of advantages, 
including cost savings (the landlord takes care of maintenance and repairs) and mobility. It is 
much easier to move if you rent than if you own a home. People who plan 
on staying in an area for a short period of time are usually better off rent-
ing even if they can afford to buy a home. The choice between buying and 
renting is obviously a major financial decision that needs to be approached 
rationally, not emotionally.
Insurance
Another important personal planning area is insurance. Insurance is 
an admittedly expensive but necessary purchase. Americans spend close 
to $150 billion each year on auto insurance alone. Some of the basic 
principles and the various types of insurance are described in Appendix B. 
Although the focus of that appendix is business insurance, much of what 
is discussed applies to your personal insurance needs as well.
Your goal is to have adequate and appropriate coverage in each 
of the major insurance types—life, health, disability, and property and 
liability. Insurance needs can vary substantially from individual to indi-
vidual. As noted earlier in Contemporary Business, some types of insur-
ance are provided to employees as fringe benefits. They typically include 
health insurance, disability insurance, and life insurance. In the standard 
arrangement, employers pay a portion of the premium. A few employers 
contract with insurance companies to offer employees auto and hom-
eowners’ insurance at discounts.
Although leasing a car has some advantages, over the 
long run it may cost more than buying the same car.

Investment Planning
Investing is a process by which money acquired through work, inheritance, or other 
sources is preserved and increased. Sound investment management is an important compo-
nent of the financial plan and can make it easier to attain other personal goals, such as buying 
a home, sending children to college, starting a business, or retiring comfortably. Furthermore, 
it is very difficult today to substantially increase wealth without investing. And, given the 
changes to the external environment—such as employer-sponsored retirement plans—it is 
likely that you will have to make investment decisions at some point during your life.
The investment process consists of four steps. The first step is to complete some pre-
liminary tasks, including setting overall personal goals, having a regular savings program, 
and managing credit properly. The second step is to establish a set of investment goals—why 
you want to invest, what you want to accomplish, and what kind of time frame you have. 
Obviously, your investment goals should be closely related to your overall personal goals. 
Next, you need to assess risk and return. You invest because you expect to earn some future 
rate of return. At the same time, however, all investing exposes you to a variety of risks. You 
need to find the proper balance between risk and return because investments offering the 
highest potential returns also expose you to more risk. Your age, income, and short- or long-
term investment time frames all have an impact on the risk-return trade-off.
The final step is to select the appropriate investments. As discussed in Chapter 16 of 
Contemporary Business, there are three general types of investments: money market instruments, 
bonds, and common stock. The proper mix of these three investments depends on such factors 
as your investment goals and investment time horizon. For instance, a 25-year-old investing 
for retirement should have close to 100 percent of his or her funds invested in common stocks 
because growth in capital is the overriding investment objective. Even with the recent turmoil 
in the stock market, stocks have generally outperformed all other investment alternatives over 
longer periods of time. On the other hand, if the 25-year-old is investing to have sufficient 
funds for a down payment on a house within the next couple of years, the investor should have 
a proportion of his or her funds invested in money market instruments or bonds given the 
short time horizon. Even after selecting the appropriate investments, the investor must moni-
tor their performance and be prepared to make changes when necessary.
Financial Planning for Tomorrow
The last major personal planning area deals with future financial issues, such as sending 
children to college and retirement and estate planning. As you know, college is expensive 
and college costs are rising at a rate that exceeds the overall rate of inflation. By beginning 
a college savings program early, parents will have a better chance of offering their children 
a choice of colleges when the time comes. While they probably won’t have enough to cover 
tuition entirely, they (and their children) will likely have to borrow less and accrue less debt 
for a college education. A variety of college savings programs exist, some of which provide 
parents with tax benefits.
Most people want to retire with sufficient funds to ensure a degree of financial security. 
Social Security will provide only a fraction of what you will need; you will be responsible 
for the rest. Depending on the standard of living you hope to maintain, you will probably 
need a savings nest egg of at least $1.5 million by the time you retire. Four important prin-
ciples apply when it comes to saving for retirement: start early, save as much as you can each 
month, take advantage of all tax-deferred retirement savings plans to which you are entitled, 
and invest your retirement savings appropriately.
Two major sources of retirement income exist: employer-sponsored retirement plans 
and individual retirement plans. Most employers offer their workers a retirement plan; some 

A-42
Appendix C
offer more than one plan. For most people, employer-sponsored retirement plans will likely 
provide the bulk of their retirement income. Essentially, two types of employer-sponsored 
retirement plans exist. A defined benefit plan guarantees a worker a certain retirement ben-
efit each year. The size depends on a number of factors, including the worker’s income and 
the length of time he or she worked for the employer. Pension plans are classified as defined 
benefit plans.
The other type of employer-sponsored retirement plan is the defined contribution plan. 
In this type of retirement plan, you contribute to your retirement account and so does your 
employer. You are given some choice of where your retirement funds can be invested. Often 
you are given a list of mutual funds in which to invest your money. A so-called 401(k) is an 
example of a defined contribution plan. Defined contribution plans are widely used and are 
in many cases replacing defined benefit plans.
Millions of Americans have some sort of individual retirement plan not tied to any 
employer. These workers may be self-employed or may merely want to supplement their 
employer-sponsored retirement savings. Examples of individual retirement plans include 
regular IRAs (individual retirement accounts), Roth IRAs, Keogh plans, and simplified 
employee pension (SEP) plans. To set up one of these retirement plans, you must meet cer-
tain eligibility requirements.
Another element of financial planning for tomorrow is estate planning. Of all the per-
sonal planning areas, estate planning is probably the least relevant for you, although your 
parents and grandparents probably face some estate-planning issues. However, all adults, 
regardless of age, need to have two documents: a valid will (naming a guardian if you have 
any minor children) and a durable power of attorney (the name varies from state to state, but 
it is a document that gives someone else the power to make financial and medical decisions if 
you are incapacitated).
This appendix has just scratched the surface of personal financial planning. We hope it has 
encouraged you to learn more. Consider taking a class in personal financial planning if your college 
or university offers one. It may be one of the most helpful classes you take while you’re in college.

Developing a 
Business Plan
What’s Next? A New Business Model for Restaurants
You’re accustomed to buying airline and concert tickets in advance—but what about meal 
tickets? We’re not referring to fast-food chains; we’re talking about fine dining restaurants. 
Traditionally, restaurant customers walk in the door and hope to find a vacant table; if they’re 
planning ahead, they’ll call for a reservation. But the idea of purchasing advance tickets for dining 
is new to most of us.
Grant Achatz, a well-known chef and restaurant owner in Chicago, has a new restaurant—based 
on a new kind of business plan. The restaurant is called Next, and instead of taking reservations, 
the restaurant is selling tickets. The plan makes sense for an eatery that is bound to be as popular as 
Achatz’s other Chicago restaurant, Alina, which is sold out many weeks in advance. “We now pay 
three or four reservationists all day long to basically tell people they can’t come to the restaurant,” 
explains Achatz. When customers purchase tickets in advance, they are as assured of a ready table as 
they would be with a reservation. Achatz and his partner, Nick Kokonas, will be able to reduce the 
hidden cost of a full-time reservation staff. They plan to pass along savings like this to their diners. 
Selling tickets “allows us to give an experience that is actually a great value,” notes Achatz.
Diners who want to enjoy a meal at Next simply visit the restaurant’s Web site. They can look 
at the menu, which will change four times a year, and lock into the fixed price for the entire six-
course meal. In addition, they can choose to dine at peak or off-peak hours, which will be reflected 
in the ticket price. For example, a table at 9:30 on a Tuesday night would cost less than a table at 
8:00 on Saturday night. Meals range from $45 to $75, with wine and other beverage pairings cost-
ing extra. A service charge—instead of a traditional tip—is included in the ticket price. This way, 
Achatz and Kokonas can distribute the gratuities among the staff as they see fit.
Achatz is known to offer unique dining experiences for which sophisticated customers are 
willing to pay. Next offers patrons total immersion in the cuisine of a specific place and time. It isn’t 
just a theme; it’s the recreation of an era, painstakingly researched by Achatz and his team. The first 
offering is based on Paris in 1912, with Escoffier-era cuisine prepared, cooked, and served down 
to the last detail. When the menu 
changes three months later, the chef 
may choose recipes evoking postwar 
Sicily or a fantasy of Chinese Cuisine 
in the year 2020.
Customers who become loyal 
fans the way sports fans buy season 
tickets may purchase a year’s subscrip-
tion to Next, locking in the price and 
the reserved table for each of the sea-
sonal menu changes. Achatz believes 
that once people get used to the idea 
of a prepaid meal, they will enjoy the 
experience. The dinner is paid for, 
Grant Achatz, a Chicago restauranteur, hopes his new idea for 
dining will take off. Get your tickets early!

Many entrepreneurs and small-business 
owners have written business plans to 
help them organize their businesses, get 
them up and running, and raise money 
for expansion. In this appendix, we cover 
the basics of business planning: what busi-
ness plans are, why they’re important, and 
who needs them. We also explain the steps 
involved in writing a good plan and the 
major  elements it should contain. Finally, 
we cover additional resources to get you 
started with your own business plan—to 
help you bring your unique ideas to reality 
with a business of your own.

and there’s no fumbling in the wallet or waiting to sign the check. “There’s no transaction in 
the restaurant at all,” Achatz points out. “So you can literally come in, sit down, start your expe-
rience, and when you’re done, you just get up and leave.”1
What Is a Business Plan?
You may wonder how the millions of different businesses operating in the United States 
and throughout the world today got their start. Often it is with a formal business plan. A 
business plan is a written document that defines what a company’s objectives are, how these 
objectives will be achieved, how the business will be financed, and how much money the 
company expects to bring in. In short, it describes where a company is, where it wants to go, 
and how it intends to get there.
Why a Business Plan Is So Important
A well-written business plan serves two key functions:
1. It organizes the business and validates its central idea.
2. It summarizes the business and its strategy to obtain funding from lenders and investors.
First, a business plan gives a business formal direction, whether it is just starting, going 
through a phase of growth, or struggling. The business plan forces the principals—the 
owners—through rigorous planning, to think through the realities of running and financ-
ing a business. In their planning, they consider many details. How will inventory be stored, 
shipped, and stocked? Where should the business be located? How will the business use the 
Internet? And most important, how will the business make enough money to make it all 
worthwhile?

A-45
Appendix D
A business plan also gives the owners a well-reasoned blueprint to refer to when daily 
challenges arise, and it acts as a benchmark by which successes and disappointments can be 
measured. Additionally, a solid business plan will sell the potential owner on the validity of 
the idea. In some cases, the by-product of developing the plan is demonstrating to a starry-
eyed person that he or she is trying to start a bad business. In other words, the process of 
writing a plan benefits a would-be businessperson as much as the final plan benefits potential 
investors.
Finally, a business plan articulates the business’s strategy to financiers who may fund 
the business, and it is usually required to obtain a bank loan. Lenders and venture capitalists 
need to see that the business owner has thought through the critical issues and presented 
a promising idea before they will consider investing in it. They are, after all, interested in 
whether it will bring them significant returns.
Who Needs a Business Plan?
Every business owner who expects to be successful needs a business plan. Some people 
mistakenly believe that they need a business plan only if it will land on the desk of a venture 
capitalist or the loan committee of a bank. Others think that writing a plan is unnecessary if 
their bank or lending institution doesn’t require it. Such assumptions miss the point of plan-
ning, because a business plan acts as a map to guide the way through the often tangled roads 
of running a business. Every small-business owner should develop a business plan because it 
empowers that person to take control.
How Do I Write a Business Plan?
Developing a business plan should mean something different to everyone. Think of a 
business plan as a clear statement of a business’s identity. A construction company has a dif-
ferent identity from a newly launched magazine, which has yet a different identity from a 
restaurant hoping to expand its share of the market. Each business has unique objectives and 
processes, and each faces different obstacles.
At the same time, good business plans contain some similar elements no matter who 
the business owner is, what he or she sells, or how far the owner is into the venture. A savvy 
business owner molds the elements of a business plan into a professional and personal repre-
sentation of the firm’s needs and goals. The plan should also realistically assess the risks and 
obstacles specific to the business and present solutions for overcoming them.
Because the document is important, it takes time to collect needed information and 
organize it. Don’t be misled into believing that you will simply sit down and begin writing. 
Before any writing begins, the business owner must become an expert in his or her field. 
Readying important information about the company and the market will make the writ-
ing easier and faster. Some critical pieces of information to have on hand are the following 
items:
 
• The company’s name, legal form of organization, location, financial highlights, and 
owners or shareholders (if any).
 • Organization charts, list of top managers, consultants or directors, and employee 
agreements.

A-46
Appendix D
 • Marketing research, customer surveys, and information about the company’s major 
competitors.
 • Product information, including goods and services offered; brochures; patents, licenses, 
and trademarks; and research and development plans.
 • Marketing plans and materials.
 • Financial statements (both current and forecasted).
The business owner also must do a lot of soul searching and brainstorming to answer 
important questions necessary to build the backbone of a healthy business. Figure D.1 lists 
some critical questions to ask yourself.
Once equipped with these answers, you can begin writing the document, which can be 
anywhere between 10 and 50 pages long. The length of the plan depends on the complexity 
of the company, whether the company is a start-up (established companies have longer his-
tories to detail), and what the plan will be used for. Regardless of size, the document should 
be well organized and easy to use, especially if the business plan is intended for external uses, 
such as to secure financing. Number all pages, include a table of contents, and make sure the 
format is attractive and professional. Include two or three illustrative charts or graphs and 
highlight the sections and important points with headings and bulleted lists. Figure D.2 out-
lines the major sections of a business plan.
Take a few minutes to read and answer these questions. 
Don’t worry about answering in too much detail at this point. 
The questions are preliminary and 
intended to help you think through your venture.
  1. In general terms, how would you explain your idea to a friend?
  2. What is the purpose or objective of your venture?
  3. What service are you going to provide, or what goods are you going to manufacture?
  4. Is there any significant difference between what you are planning and what already exists? 
  5. How will the quality of your product compare with competitive offerings?
  6. What is the overview of the industry or service sector you are going to enter? Write it out. 
  7. What is the history, current status, and future of the industry?
  8. Who is your customer or client base?
  9. Where and by whom will your good or service be marketed?
10. How much will you charge for the product you are planning?
11. Where is the financing going to come from to initiate your venture?
12. What training and experience do you have that qualifies you for this venture?
13. Does such training or experience give you a significant edge?
14. If you lack specific experience, how do you plan to gain it?

Appendix D
The following paragraphs discuss the most common 
elements of an effective business plan. When you need 
additional instruction or information as you write, refer to 
the “Resources” section at the end of the appendix.
Executive Summary
The primary purpose of an executive summary is 
to entice readers sufficiently to read more about the 
business. An executive summary is a one- to two-page 
snapshot of what the overall business plan explains in 
detail. Consider it a business plan within a business plan. 
Through its enthusiasm and quick momentum, the sum-
mary should capture the reader’s imagination. Describe 
your strategy for succeeding in a positive, intriguing, and 
realistic way and briefly yet thoroughly answer the first 
questions anyone would have about your business: who, 
what, why, when, where, and how. Financiers always turn 
to the executive summary first. If it isn’t well presented 
or lacks the proper information, they will quickly move 
on to the next business plan in the stack. The execu-
tive summary is just as important to people funding the 
business with personal resources, however, because it 
channels their motivations into an articulate mission 
statement. It is a good idea to write the summary last, 
because it will inevitably be revised once the business 
plan takes final shape.
To write an effective executive summary, focus on 
the issues that are most important to your business’s 
success and save the supporting matters for the body. The executive summary should 
describe the firm’s strategy and goals, the good or service it is selling, and the advantages 
it has over the competition. It should also give a snapshot of how much money will be 
required to launch the business, how it will be used, and how the lenders or investors will 
recoup their funds.
Introduction
The introduction follows the executive summary. After the executive summary has 
offered an attractive synopsis, the introduction should begin to discuss the fine details of the 
business. It should be crafted to include any material the upcoming marketing and financ-
ing sections do not cover. The introduction should describe the company, the management 
team, and the product in detail. If one of these topics is particularly noteworthy for your 
business, you may want to present that topic as its own section. Listen to what you write and 
respond as the plan takes shape.
Include basic information about the company—its past, present, and future. What are 
the company’s roots, what is its current status, and what actions need to be taken to achieve 
its goals? If you are starting a company, include a description of the evolution of the concept. 
Be sure to tie all of the business’s goals and plans to the industry in which it will operate, and 
describe the industry itself.

Appendix D
A business doesn’t run itself, of course. People are the heart of a business, so write 
an appealing picture of the business’s management team. Who are the key players and 
how does their experience resonate with the company’s goals? Describe their—or your, 
if you are a sole proprietor—education, training, and experience, and highlight and refer 
to résumés included later in the plan. Be honest, however—not all businesses are started 
by experts. If you lack demonstrated experience in a certain area, explain how you plan 
to get it.
Also describe the product, the driving force behind the venture. What are you 
offering, and why is it special? What are the costs of the service or price tag on the 
good? Analyze the features of the offering and the effect these features have on 
the overall cost.
Marketing Strategy
Next comes the marketing strategy section. The marketing strategy describes the 
market’s need for the item and the way the business will fulfill it. Marketing strategies 
are not based on informal projections or observations. They are the result of a care-
ful market analysis. So formulating a marketing strategy allows the business owner to 
become familiar with every aspect of the particular market. If done properly, it will allow 
you to define your target market and position your business within that sector to get its 
share of sales.
The marketing strategy includes a discussion of the size of the customer base that will 
want to purchase your good or service and the projected rate of growth for the product or 
category. Highlight information on the demographics of your customers. Demographics are 
statistical characteristics of the segment of the market, such as income, gender, and age. 
What types of people will purchase your product? How old are they, and where do they live? 
What is their lifestyle like? For example, someone starting an interior design business will 
want to report how many homeowners live within a certain radius of the firm, as well as their 
median income. Of course, this section of the marketing analysis will be quite different for a 
company that conducts all of its business online. You will want to know the types of people 
who will shop at your Web site, but your discussion won’t be limited to one geographic area. 
It is also a good idea to describe the trends in your product category. Trends are consumer 
and business tendencies or patterns that business owners can exploit to gain market share in 
an industry.
The marketing strategy should also detail your distribution, pricing, and promo-
tional goals. Discuss the average price of your offering and the reasons behind the 
price you have chosen. How do you intend to let your potential customers know that 
you have a product to sell? How will you sell it—through a catalog, in a retail location, 
online, or perhaps a combination of all three? The effectiveness of your distribution, 
pricing, and promotional goals determines the extent to which you will be able to 
garner market share.
Competitors are another important part of your marketing strategy. What compa-
nies are already selling products similar to yours? Include a list of your competitors to 
show that you know exactly who they are and what you are up against. Describe what 
you think are their major strengths and weaknesses and how successful they have been 
within your market.
Also include the market penetration, which is the percentage of total customers who 
have purchased a company’s product. If there are 10,000 people in your market, and 5,000 

A-49
Appendix D
have purchased your product, your market penetration is 50 percent. The potential sales 
revenue, also an important figure to include, is the total revenue of a company if it cap-
tured 100 percent market penetration. In other words, this figure represents the total dol-
lar value of sales you would bring in if everyone who is a potential customer purchased 
your product.
Financing the Business
The goal of a business is to make money. Everything in the business plan lays the 
foundation for the financing section. Business owners should not skip this section even 
if they are not seeking outside money. While it is crucial to have an accurate financial 
analysis to get financing, it also is a necessary exercise for business owners funding the 
venture themselves. The financing section demonstrates the cost of the product, operat-
ing expenses, expected sales revenue and profit, and the amount of the business owner’s 
personal funds that will be invested to get the business up and running. The financial pro-
jections should be compelling but accurate and based on realistic assumptions. The owner 
should be able to defend them.
Any assumptions made in the body of the business plan should be tied into the 
financial section. For instance, if you think you will need a staff of five, your cash flow 
analysis should explain how you are going to pay them. A cash flow analysis, a man-
datory component of a financial analysis, shows how much money will flow through 
your business throughout the year. It helps you plan for staggered purchasing, high-
volume months, and slow periods. Your business may be cyclical or seasonal, so the 
cash flow projection lets you know if you need to arrange a line of credit to cover 
periodic shortfalls. In addition, an income statement is a critical component. The 
income statement is a statement of income and expenses your company has accrued 
over a period of time.
Remember that leaving out important details can undercut your credibility, so be 
thorough. The plan must include your assumptions about the conditions under which your 
business will operate. It should cover details such as market strength; date of start-up; sales 
buildup; gross profit margin; equipment, furniture, and fixtures required; and payroll and 
other key expenses that will affect the financial plan. In addition, a banker will want a pro 
forma balance sheet, which provides an estimate of what the business owns (assets), what it 
owes (liabilities), and what it is worth (owner’s equity). Refer to Chapters 15, 16, and 17 of 
Contemporary Business for additional details on accounting, financial statements, and financial 
management.
Résumés of Principals
The final element of the business plan is the inclusion of the résumés of the principals 
behind the business: the management team. Each résumé should include detailed employ-
ment information and accomplishments. If applicable to your business, consider expanding 
on the traditional résumé by including business affiliations, professional memberships, hob-
bies, and leisure activities.
However you choose to develop a business plan, make sure that you develop 
the plan. It should sound as though it was written by the entrepreneur, not by some 
outside “expert.”

Resources
A tremendous amount of material is available to help business owners—whether 
existing or prospective—write effective business plans. The biggest task is narrowing it 
down to which resources are right for you. The Internet delivers an abundance of sound 
business-planning tools and advice, much of which are free. It allows you to seek diverse 
examples and opinions, which is important because no one source will match your situation 
exactly. Your library and career center also have a wealth of resources. Following are some 
helpful resources for business planning.
Books
Dozens of books exist on how to write a business plan. Examples include 
the following:
 • Edward Blackwell, How to Prepare a Business Plan, 7th ed. (London: Kogan Page Ltd., 2011).
 • Steven D. Peterson, Peter E. Jaret, and Barbara Findlay Schenck, Business Plans Kit for 
Dummies, 3rd ed. (Wiley Publishing, 2010).
 • Mike McKeever, How to Write a Business Plan, 10th ed. (Berkeley, CA: Nolo Press, 2010).
 • John W. Mullins, The New Business Road Test: What Entrepreneurs and Executives Should 
Do Before Writing a Business Plan, 3rd ed. (Prentice Hall Financial Times, 2010).
 • Michael Gerber, The E-Myth Enterprise: How to Turn a Great Idea into a Thriving Business 
(New York: Harper Collins, 2009).
Web Sites
 • Entrepreneur, Inc., and BusinessWeek magazines offer knowledgeable guides to writing a 
business plan. Entrepreneur’s Web site also contains sample business plans.

 • If you are hoping to obtain funding with your business plan, you should familiarize your-
self with what investors are looking for. Two professional associations for the venture 
capital industry are the following:

Appendix D
Software
Business-planning software can give an initial shape to your business plan. However, 
a word of caution is in order if you write a business plan using the software’s template. 
Bankers and potential investors, such as venture capitalists, read so many business plans that 
those based on templates may sink to the bottom of the pile. Also, if you aren’t looking for 
funding, using software can undercut a chief purpose of writing a plan—learning about your 
unique idea. So think twice before you deprive yourself of that experience. Remember, soft-
ware is a tool. It can help you get started, stay organized, and build a professional-looking 
business plan, but it can’t actually write the plan for you.
Associations and Organizations
Many government and professional organizations provide assistance to would-be 
business owners. Here is a partial list:
 • The U.S. Small Business Administration offers planning materials, along with other 
resources.

innovative method of selling tickets in advance. Now 
think of another business that doesn’t usually sell tick-
ets in advance—yet. Write a brief plan for converting 
that business to the pre-selling business model. Why do 
you think this would be successful? What might be the 
drawbacks?
2. Do you dream of starting your own business? Take your 
idea and answer as many of the self-evaluation questions in 
Figure D.1 as you can. Share your answers with the class. 
Then file your answers away to read at a future date—either 
when you have graduated from college or when you think 
you are ready to pursue your own business.
3. Write the executive summary portion of the business plan 
for your potential business. You may use the answers to the 
questions in Figure D.1 as a springboard.

Careers in Contemporary Business
You’ll be hitting the job market soon—if you haven’t already. Regardless of what industry 
you want to work in—financial services, marketing, travel, construction, hospitality, manufactur-
ing, wireless communications—you need an education. Attending college and taking a business 
course like this one gives you an edge because business skills and knowledge are needed in many 
different fields. But education comes in many forms. In addition to taking classes, you should try 
to gain related real-life experience. A summer job, an internship, or even a volunteer opportunity 
can give you excellent experience that you can build on once you graduate. Cooperative educa-
tion programs and work-study programs can also give you hands-on experience while you pursue 
your education. While many students across the country will be doing the same thing, you can set 
yourself apart through your work ethic and initiative.
You will be responsible for earning a living once you leave school—if you aren’t already doing 
so. Your level of education will probably influence your earnings. Table E.1 shows some hard 
facts about earnings as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. Not only is there a wide discrepancy 
between earnings for high-school graduates and college graduates, but there is still a gap between 
earnings for men and women.1
Keep in mind that while a degree may help you get in the door for certain job interviews and 
may put you on a path for advancement, it doesn’t guarantee success; you have to achieve that 
yourself.
Companies plan their hiring strategies carefully in order to attract and keep the most produc-
tive, creative employees and avoid the cost of rehiring. So, soon-to-be graduates still need to be on 
their toes. But creativity has never been in short supply among business students, and by the time 
you finish this class—and college—you will be well equipped to take on the challenge. You’ll be

able to think of your hunt for employment as a course in itself, at the end of which you will 
have a job. And you will be on your way toward a rewarding business career.
During this course, you are exposed to all the functional areas of business. You learn 
how firms are organized and operated. You find out who does what in a company. Gradually, 
you identify industries and disciplines—such as sales, finance, or product design—that inter-
est you. And you learn about many organizations, large and small—who founded them, what 
products they offer, how they serve their customers, and what types of decisions they make. 
In short, you gain knowledge about business that you can apply to your career search and life.
Choosing a career is an important life decision. It sets you on a path that will influence 
where you live, how much money you earn, what type of people you meet, and what you do 
every day. And whether your goal is to operate an organic farm or to rise high in the ranks 
of a major corporation, you’ll need to understand the principles of business. Even if you 
think you’re headed down a different path, business skills may prove to be important. In 
addition, many fields are beginning to recognize the importance of a broader base of knowl-
edge than specialized technical skills, and business knowledge is part of that base.
For example, engineers used to rely almost solely on a foundation of technical skill and 
expertise. But experts in the industry now report a trend toward a more well-rounded educa-
tion. While engineers still need a strong technical foundation, they need additional skills as 
well. “There’s no question that the employee who can do five things is harder to get rid of 
than the one who can only do one or two,” says an engineer who held onto his job during 
the economic downturn. “The more diverse your toolset, the more stable your job will be.”2 
That’s why this appendix discusses the best way to approach career decisions and to prepare 
for an entry-level job—your first permanent employment after leaving school. We then look at 
a range of business careers and discuss employment opportunities in a variety of fields.
It’s important to remember that you’ll be looking for a job regardless of the state of the 
overall economy, whether it’s sluggish or booming. You’ll read about job cuts and unem-
ployment rates, hiring freezes and wage increases. But if you stay flexible and are ready to 
work—just about any time and anywhere—you’ll succeed.3

Internships—A Great Way to 
Acquire Real-World Experience
Many business students complete one or more internships prior to completing their 
academic careers. Some arrange internships during the summer, while others work at them 
during a semester away from college. An internship gives you hands-on experience in a real 
business environment, whether it’s in banking, the hotel industry, or retailing. Not only does 
an internship teach you how a business runs, but it can also help you decide whether you 
want to pursue a career in a particular industry. You might spend a summer interning in the 
admissions department of a hospital and then graduate with your job search focused on hos-
pital administration. Or you might decide you’d much rather work for a magazine publisher 
or a construction company.
When you apply for an internship, don’t expect to be paid much, if at all. The true value 
of an internship lies in its hands-on experience. An internship bridges the theory–practice 
educational gap. It will help carry you from your academic experience to your professional 
future. Also keep in mind that, as an intern, you will not be running a department. People 
may not ask for your input or ideas. You may work in the warehouse or copy center. You 
might be answering phones or entering data. But it is important to make the most of your 
internship. Because many companies make permanent job offers—or offers to enter paid 
training programs—to the best interns, you’ll want to stand out.
Internships can serve as critical networking and job-hunting tools. In many instances, 
they lead to future employment opportunities, allowing students to demonstrate techni-
cal proficiency while providing cost-effective employee training for the company. Even if 
you don’t end up being hired by the company for which you interned, the experience is 
extremely valuable to your job hunt. One study estimates that almost one-third of all entry-
level hires had internships prior to being hired. PricewaterhouseCoopers hired 91 percent of 
its entry-level employees from its pool of interns during one recent year.4
With this information in mind, start thinking the way a professional does now. Here are some 
tips for a successful internship experience. These guidelines are also helpful for your first job.
 
• Dress like a professional. Dress appropriately for your future career. During an 
interview visit, look around to see what employees are wearing. If you have any ques-
tions, ask your supervisor.
 • Act like a professional. Arrive on time to work. Be punctual for any meetings or 
assignments. Ask questions and listen to the answers carefully. Complete your work 
thoroughly and on time. Maintain good etiquette on the phone, in meetings, and in all 
interactions with other people.
 • Stand out. Work hard and show initiative, but behave appropriately. Don’t try to use 
authority that you do not have. Show that you are willing to learn.
 • Be evaluated. Even if your internship does not include a formal evaluation, ask your 
employer how you are doing to learn about your strengths and weaknesses.
 • Keep in touch. Once you complete your internship, stay in touch periodically with the 
firm so that people know what you are currently doing.
An excellent source of information about the nation’s outstanding internships can be found 
at your local bookstore—The Best 109 Internships, 9th edition, published by The Princeton 
Review. The same organization also publishes The Internship Bible, which is also helpful.

A-56
Appendix E
In addition to an internship, you can build your résumé with work and life experience 
through volunteer opportunities, extracurricular activities, and summer or off-campus 
study programs. Cooperative education also provides valuable experience. Cooperative educa-
tion programs are similar to internships, but the jobs themselves usually pay more. These 
programs may take place during the summer or during the school year—typically, students 
might take classes one semester and hold jobs the next semester. Most cooperative programs 
are specific to a major field of study, such as retailing or information technology. At your 
cooperative job, you’ll be treated like a real full-time employee, meaning you’ll work long 
hours and probably have more responsibility that you would as an intern. And depending on 
how these programs are scheduled, you might add a semester or two to your college educa-
tion. But in the long run, you will gain knowledge and work experience that will serve you 
well as you build your career.5
Self-Assessment For 
Career Development
You are going to spend a lot of time during your life working, so why not find a job—or 
at least an industry—that interests you? To choose the line of work that suits you best, you 
must first understand yourself. Self-assessment involves looking in the mirror and seeing the 
real you—with all your strengths and weaknesses. It means answering some tough questions. 
But being honest with yourself pays off because it will help you find a career that is chal-
lenging, rewarding, and meaningful to you. As you get to know yourself better, you may dis-
cover that helping other people really makes you happy. You may realize that to feel secure, 
you need to earn enough to put away substantial savings. Or you might learn that you are 
drawn to risks and the unknown, characteristics that might point you toward owning your 
own business someday. Each of these discoveries provides you with valuable information in 
choosing a career.
Many resources are available to help you in selecting a career. They include school 
libraries, career guidance and placement offices, counseling centers, and online job-search 
services. They include alumni from your college, as well as friends, family, and neighbors. 
Don’t forget the contacts you make during an internship—they can help you in many ways. 
Ask questions of anyone you know—a local retailer, banker, or restaurant owner. Most peo-
ple will be happy to speak with you or arrange a time to do so.
If you are interested in a particular industry or company, you might be able to arrange 
an informational interview—an appointment with someone who can provide you with more 
knowledge about an industry or career path. This type of interview is different from one that 
follows your application for a specific job, although it may ultimately lead to that. The infor-
mational interview can help you decide whether you want to pursue a particular avenue of 
employment. It also gives you some added experience in the interview process—without the 
pressure. To arrange an interview, tap anyone you know—friends of your parents, local busi-
nesspeople, or coordinators of not-for-profit organizations. Colleges often have databases of 
graduates who are working in various fields who are willing to talk with students on an infor-
mational basis, so be sure to start your search right at your own school.
To help you get started asking and answering the questions that will help you begin 
looking in the right direction, you can visit a number of Web sites that offer online 
career assessment tests. Career Explorer, at http://www.careerexplorer.net is one such 
site; LiveCareer at http://www.livecareer.com is another. These sites and others, such as 
Monster’s Career Fit Indicator at http://www.monster.com, help you identify your interests,

strengths, and weaknesses—including some that may surprise you.6 In addition, follow the 
self-assessment process outlined in the next section to learn more about yourself.
The Self-Assessment Process
For a thorough assessment of your goals and interests, follow these steps:
1. Outline your career interests. What field or work activities interest you? What 
rewards do you want to gain from work?
2. Outline your career goals. What do you want to achieve through your career? What type 
of job can you see yourself doing? Where do you see yourself in a year? In five years? Do 
you have an ultimate dream job? How long are you willing to work to reach it? Write your 
goals down so that you can refer to them later.
3. Make plans to reach your goal. Do you need more education? Does the career require 
an apprenticeship or a certain number of years on the job? Outline the requirements you’ll 
need to meet in order to reach your goal.
4. List your skills and specific talents. Write down your strengths—job skills you already 
have, as well as skills you have developed in life. For instance, you might know how to use 
financial software, and you might be good at negotiating with people. In addition, your 
school’s career development office probably has standardized tests that can help determine 
your aptitude for specific careers. However, take these only as a guideline. If you really 
want to pursue a certain career, go for it.
5. List your weaknesses. This can be tough—it can also be fun. If you are shy about meet-
ing new people, put shyness on your list. If you are quick to argue, admit it. If you aren’t 
the best business-letter writer or think you’re terrible at math, confess to yourself. This 
list gives you an opportunity to see where you need improvement—and take steps to turn 
weaknesses into strengths.
6. Briefly sketch out your educational background. Write down the schools, colleges, and 
special training programs you have attended, along with any courses you plan to complete 
before starting full-time employment. Make a candid assessment of how your background 
matches up with the current job market. Then make plans to complete any further educa-
tion you may need.
7. List the jobs you have held. Include jobs that paid, internships, and volunteer oppor-
tunities. They all gave you valuable experience. As you make your list, think about what 
you liked and disliked about each. Maybe you liked working with the general public as a 
supermarket cashier. Perhaps you enjoyed caring for animals at a local shelter.
8. Consider your hobbies and personal interests. Many people have turned hobbies and 
personal pursuits into rewarding careers. Mick Jagger, lead singer of the Rolling Stones, has 
a master’s degree from the London School of Economics. Without it, he probably wouldn’t 
have been able to manage his rock group’s vast business dealings. Jake Burton Carpenter 
earned a bachelor’s degree in economics, but he loved winter sports. So he started a snow-
board manufacturing company—and revolutionized the way people get from the top of a 
snowy mountain to the bottom. Cooking and catering star Paula Deen needed to support 
her young family. She loved the cooking from her own region—the South—so she opened 
a small business in which she and her boys delivered freshly made bag lunches to local busi-
nesses. Today she is a celebrity with her own television show, cookbooks, Web site, retail 
products, and more.7 Turning a hobby into a career doesn’t happen overnight, though, nor 
is it easy. It requires the same amount of research and hard work as any other business. But 
for many people, it is a labor of love—and ultimately succeeds because they refuse to give up.

Job Search Guidelines
Once you have narrowed your choice of career possibilities to two or three that seem 
right for you, get your job search under way. The characteristics that made these career 
choices attractive to you are also likely to catch the attention of other job seekers, so you 
must expect competition. Locate available positions that interest you; then be resourceful! 
Your success depends on gathering as much information as possible.
Register at Your Career Center
Register at your school’s career center. Establish an applicant file, including letters of 
recommendation and supporting personal information. Most placement offices send out 
periodic lists of new job vacancies by e-mail, so be sure to get your name and e-mail address 
on the list. Visit the office regularly, and become a familiar face. Find out how the office 
arranges interviews with company representatives who visit campus. If your school has a 
career event, be sure to attend.
Preparing Your Job Credentials
Most placement or credential files include the following information:
1. letters of reference from people who know you well—instructors and employers
2. transcripts of course work to date
3. personal data form to report factual information
4. statement of career goals.
The career center will provide you with special forms to help you to develop your file. 
Often, these forms can be completed online. Prepare the forms carefully, since employers 
are always interested in your written communication skills. Keep a copy of the final file for 
later use in preparing similar information for other employment sources. Check back with 
the career center to make sure your file is in order, and update it whenever necessary to 
reflect additional academic accomplishments and added work experiences.
Letters of reference are very important, because they give prospective employers both 
personal and professional insights about you. They can influence a hiring decision. So, make 
a careful list of people who might be willing to write letters of reference. Your references 
should not be family members or close friends. Instead, choose a coach, an instructor, a for-
mer employer, or someone else whose knowledge could contribute to your job application. A 
soccer coach could vouch for your hard work and determination. A music teacher might be 
able to detail how well you accept instruction. A former employer might describe your punc-
tuality and ability to get along with others. If possible, include someone from your school’s 
business faculty on your list of references, or at least one of your current instructors.
Always ask people personally for letters of reference. Be prepared to give them brief 
outlines of your academic preparation, along with information about your job interests and 
career goals. This information will help them prepare their letters quickly and efficiently. It 
also shows that you are serious about the task and respect their time. Remember, however, 
that these people are very busy. Allow them at least a couple of weeks to prepare their refer-
ence letters; then follow up politely on missing ones. Always call or write to thank them for 
writing the letters.

Finding Employment through the Internet
The Internet plays an important role in connecting employers and job seekers. 
Companies of all sizes post their job opportunities on the Web, both on their own sites and 
on job sites such as Monster.com, Yahoo! HotJobs.com, and CareerBuilder.com. Specialized 
or niche sites such as Accounting.com and TechCareers.com are also gaining popularity. 
Some sites are free to applicants, while others charge a subscription fee. Figure E.1 provides 
a sampling of general and more-focused career sites.
Career Web sites typically offer job postings, tips on creating an effective résumé, a 
place to post your résumé, and advice on interviews and careers. If this sounds easy, keep in 
mind that these sites may receive hundreds of thousands of hits each day from job hunters, 
which means you have plenty of competition. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use one of 
these sites as part of your job search; just don’t make it your sole source. Savvy job seekers 
often find that their time is better spent zeroing in on niche boards offering more focused 
listings. Naturally, if a particular company interests you, go to the firm’s Web site, where 
available positions will be posted. If you are interested in applying for a job at the account-
ing firm Ernst & Young, go to http://www.ey.com. If you are looking for a job with Whole 
Foods Market, visit http://www.wholefoods.com. And if you fancy yourself working for an 
outdoor retailer, go to Recreational Equipment Inc. (REI) at http://www.rei.com.
Newspapers, the source for traditional classified want ads, also post their ads on the 
Web. Job seekers can even visit sites that merge ads from many different newspapers into 
one searchable database, such as CareerBuilder (http://www.careerbuilder.com). Some sites 
go a step farther and create separate sections for each career area. For example, entire sec-
tions may be devoted to accounting, marketing, and other business professions. Searches can 
then be narrowed according to geographic location, entry level, company name, job title, job 
description, and other categories.
As mentioned earlier, you can connect with potential employers by posting your résumé 
on job sites. Employers search the résumé database for prospects with the right qualifica-
tions. One commonly used approach is for an employer to list one or more keywords to select

candidates for personal interviews—for example, “retail sales experience,” “network archi-
tecture,” or “spa management”—and then browse the résumés that contain all the required 
keywords. Employers also scan résumés into their human resource database, and then when 
a manager requests, say, ten candidates, the database is searched by keywords that have been 
specified as part of the request. Job seekers are responding to this computer screening of 
applicants by making sure that relevant keywords appear on their résumés.
The Contemporary Business Web site hosts a comprehensive job and career assistance sec-
tion. The site is updated frequently to include the best job and career sites for identifying 
and landing the career you want, as well as current strategies for getting the best results from 
your Web-based career-search activities.
Finding Employment through Other Sources
The importance of registering at your college’s career planning or placement office was 
noted earlier. If you have completed formal academic coursework at more than one institu-
tion, you may be able to set up a placement file at each. In addition, you may want to contact 
private and public employment services available in your location or in the area where you 
would like to live.
Private Employment Agencies These firms often specialize in certain 
types of jobs—such as marketing, finance, sales, or engineering—offering services for both 
employers and job candidates that are not available elsewhere. Many private agencies inter-
view, test, and screen job applicants so that potential employers do not have to do so. Job 
candidates benefit from the service by being accepted by the agency and because the agency 
makes the first contact with the potential employer.
A private employment agency usually charges the prospective employer a fee for finding 
a suitable employee. Other firms charge job seekers a fee for helping find them a job. Be sure 
that you understand the terms of any agreement you sign with a private employment agency.
State Employment Offices Don’t forget to check the employment office of 
your state government. Remember that in many states, these public agencies process unem-
ployment compensation applications along with other related work. Because of the mix of 
duties, some people view state employment agencies as providing services for semiskilled or 
unskilled workers. However, these agencies do list jobs in many professional categories and 
are often intimately involved with identifying job finalists for major new facilities moving to 
your state. In addition, many of the jobs listed at state employment offices may be with state 
or federal agencies and may include professionals such as accountants, attorneys, healthcare 
professionals, and scientists.
Learning More About Job Opportunities
Carefully study the various employment opportunities you have identified. Obviously, 
you will like some more than others, but you can examine a variety of factors when assessing 
each job possibility:
 
• actual job responsibilities
 • industry characteristics
 • nature of the company
 • geographic location

A-61
Appendix E
 • salary and opportunities for advancement
 • contribution of the job to your long-range career objectives.
Too many job applicants consider only the most striking features of a job, perhaps its 
location or the salary offer. However, a comprehensive review of job openings should pro-
vide a balanced perspective of the overall employment opportunity, including both long-run 
and short-run factors.
Building a Résumé
Regardless of how you locate job openings, you must learn how to prepare and submit 
a résumé, a written summary of your personal, educational, and professional achievements. 
The résumé is a personal document covering your educational background, work experience, 
career preferences and goals, and major interests that may be relevant. It also includes such 
basic contact information as your home and e-mail addresses, as well as your telephone num-
ber. It should not include information on your age, marital status, race, or ethnic background.
Your résumé is usually your formal introduction to an employer, so it should present 
you in the best light, accentuating your strengths and potential to contribute to a firm as 
an employee. However, it should never contain embellishments or inaccuracies. You don’t 
want to begin your career with unethical behavior, and an employer is bound to discover any 
discrepancies in fact—either immediately or during the months following your employment. 
Either event typically results in short-circuiting your career path.
Organizing Your Résumé
The primary purpose of a résumé is to highlight your qualifications for a job, usually 
on a single page. An attractive layout facilitates the employer’s review of your qualifications. 
You can prepare your résumé in several ways. You may use narrative sentences to explain 
job duties and career goals, or you may present information in outline form. A résumé 
included as part of your credentials file at the career center on campus should be quite short. 
Remember to design it around your specific career objectives.
Figures E.2, E.3, and E.4 illustrate different ways to organize your résumé—by reverse chro-
nology, or time; by function; and by results. Regardless of which format you select, you will want 
to include the following: a clearly stated objective, your work or professional experience, your 
education, your personal interests such as sports or music, and your volunteer work. While all 
three formats are acceptable, one study showed that 78 percent of employers preferred the reverse 
chronological format—with the most recent experience listed first—because it was easiest to follow.
Tips for Creating a Strong Résumé
Your résumé should help you stand out from the crowd, just as your college admissions 
application did. A company may receive hundreds or even thousands of résumés, so you want 
yours to be on the top of the stack. Here are some do’s and don’ts:
Do:
 • State your immediate objective clearly. If you are applying for a specific job, say so. State 
why you want the job and why you want to work at this particular company.
 • Use terms related to your field, so that a human resource manager can locate them 
quickly. If you are submitting your résumé online, use words that will create an

Take your time with your résumé; it is one of the most important documents you’ll cre-
ate during your career. If you need help, go to your school’s career center. If you are dealing 
with an employment agency, a counselor there should be able to help as well.
Keep in mind that you will probably have to modify your résumé at times to tailor it

between standing out and being lost in a sea of other applicants.

cover letter will make the recipient want to take the next step and read your résumé. Here 
are a few tips for preparing an outstanding letter:
 • Write the letter to a specific person, if possible. A letter addressed to “to whom it may 
concern” may never reach the right person. Call the company or check its Web site for 
the name of the person to whom you should send your letter. It might be someone in 
human resources or a person in the department where you’d actually be working. Be 
sure to obtain the person’s title if possible (such as general manager or director), and 
spell the person’s name correctly.
 • Introduce yourself and explain the purpose of your letter—to apply for a job.
 • Describe briefly an example of your best work or most ambitious project.
 • Keep it short—a page is acceptable, half a page even better.
 • Request an interview.
 • Thank the person for his or her time and consideration.
 • Make sure all your contact information is in the letter—name, address, home phone 
number, cell phone number, and e-mail address.
 • Proofread your letter carefully.9
Submitting Your Online Résumé
You may write a sparkling cover letter and stellar résumé, but if your online submis-
sion is blocked or tossed aside by an automated processing system, it won’t have a chance to 
impress the person for whom it was intended. Here are a few tips for making certain your 
letter and résumé reach their mark.
 • Review the formatting of your résumé to make sure it will appear the same to the recipi-
ent as it does to you. Delete any unusual symbols or fonts.
 • Use keywords that create a match and allow your résumé through the company’s filter. 
This aplies to the subject line of your email as well, which should be specific and contain 
keywords such as “application for sales trainee job.”
 • Include your cover letter in the e-mail.
 • Send your résumé in the body of the e-mail—not as an attachment. This is more con-
venient for the recipient, and it also avoids the disaster of having your attachment auto-
matically deleted by an antivirus system.
 • Do not send graphics, because they may be blocked or deleted as well.
 • If you are answering an ad, read the instructions for application and follow them exactly.10
The Job Interview
Congratulations! You’ve prepared an effective résumé, and you’ve been contacted for 
an interview. An interview is more than a casual conversation. During an interview, at least 
one manager will learn about you, and you’ll learn more about the company and the job. 
Although you may feel nervous about the interview, you can control some of its outcome by 
doing your homework: planning and preparing for this important encounter with your poten-
tial employer. Before you meet with an interviewer, learn everything you can about the firm. 
The simplest way to do this is to visit the company’s Web site. You can also check with your 

A-66
Appendix E
school’s career center. If you know anyone who works for the company, you may ask 
the person about the firm. Try to learn the answers to the following questions about the 
organization:
 
• What does the firm do—manufacture clothing, market snack foods, produce films, sell 
cars? If you are applying for a job at a large corporation, zero in on the division for 
which you would be working.
 • What is the company’s mission? Many firms include a statement about their purpose in 
the business world—to supply affordable energy to communities, to serve fresh food, to 
make communication easier. Understanding why the company exists will help you grasp 
where it is headed and why.
 • Where, when, and by whom was the company founded? Learn a little about the history 
of the firm.
 • What is its position in the marketplace? Is it a leader or is it trying to gain a competitive 
advantage? Who are its main competitors?
 • Where is the firm based? Does it have facilities located around the country and the 
world, or is it purely local?
 • How is the company organized? Are there multiple divisions and products?
 • Learning about the firm indicates to the interviewer that you have initiative and motiva-
tion, as well as an interest in the firm’s culture and history. You have taken the time and 
effort to find out more about the organization, and your enthusiasm shows.
Tips for Successful Interviewing
An interview is your personal introduction to the company. You want to make a good 
impression, but you also want to find out whether you and the firm are a good fit. Although 
the interviewer will be asking most of the questions, you will want to ask some, as well. 
People who conduct interviews say that the most important qualities candidates can exhibit 
are self-confidence, preparedness, and an ability to communicate clearly.
When you are contacted for an interview, find out the name(s) of the person or 
people who will be interviewing you. It’s also appropriate to ask whether the initial inter-
view will be with a human resource manager or with the person to whom you would 
be reporting on the job, or both. Many people who conduct initial job interviews work 
in their firms’ human resource divisions. These interviewers act as gatekeepers and can 
make recommendations to managers and supervisors about which individuals to interview 
further or hire. Managers who head the units in which an applicant will be employed may 
get involved later in the hiring process. Some hiring decisions come from human resource 
personnel together with the immediate supervisor of the prospective employee. In other 
cases, immediate supervisors make the decision alone. At your interview, keep in mind the 
following tips.
Do:
 • Dress appropriately. Dress as if it is your first day of work at the firm. Conceal any 
tattoos or body piercings and wear simple jewelry.
 • Arrive a few minutes early. This gives you time to relax and take in the surroundings. 
It also shows that you are punctual and care about other people’s time.
 • Introduce yourself with a smile and a handshake. Be friendly, but not overly familiar.

A-67
Appendix E
 • Be yourself—at your best. Don’t suddenly adopt a new personality. But try to be con-
fident, polite, respectful, and interested in the people who are spending time with you. 
Be sure to thank each person who interviews you.
 • Listen. Pay attention to what the interviewer is saying. If something is unclear to you, 
ask for clarification. Turn off your cell phone. Your full attention should be on the con-
versation you are having in the interview.
 • Use appropriate language. As in your résumé and cover letter, be sure to use correct 
English. You don’t need to be stiff or formal, but avoid slang or phrases that you know 
are inappropriate for the situation.
 • Be positive in your outlook. Be enthusiastic about the firm and the job, but don’t go 
overboard.
Don’t:
 • Talk too much. Avoid telling the interviewer a lot about your personal life, or why you 
left a particular job. Answer questions honestly and thoroughly, but don’t dip into irrel-
evant details.
 • Be arrogant or aggressive. Self-confidence is a good trait, but don’t miss the mark by 
behaving in an arrogant or condescending manner. Certainly don’t become aggressive, 
demanding that the interviewer offer you the job or even another interview.
 • Act indifferent or bored. This may not be the job you ultimately want, but treat the 
interview and the interviewer with respect and attention. If you make a good impression, 
the firm is likely to keep your name on file—and that dream job may appear after all.
 • Don’t get ahead of yourself. This is not the time to discuss salary, vacation, or benefits.11
Answering and Asking Questions
In a typical format, the interviewer gives you ample opportunity to talk about yourself and 
your goals. You want to present your thoughts clearly and concisely, in an organized fashion, 
without rambling on to unrelated topics. The interviewer may wait until you are finished or 
prompt you to talk about certain subjects by asking questions. Be as specific as possible when 
answering questions. The questions that interviewers ask often include the following:
 
• “Why do you want this job?”
 • “Why do you want to work in this field?”
 • “What are your short-term goals? Long-term objectives?”
 • “Where do you see yourself in five years? In ten years?”
 • “What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses?”
 • “What motivates you?”
 • “Describe a situation in which you made a tough decision or solved a problem.”
 • “What did you like best about your last job? What did you like least?”
 • “Why did you leave your last job?”
 • “Why should my firm hire you?”
 • “Are you considering other jobs or companies?”
Some of these questions may seem tougher than others, but you can reduce your anxiety 
by preparing for them. First, figure out which questions you fear the most. Then think about 

A-68
Appendix E
possible answers that are both truthful and positive. Rehearse your delivery in front of a 
mirror or with a friend.12
At some point, the interviewer will probably ask you whether you have any questions of 
your own. It’s a good idea to come prepared with some questions, but others may arise during 
the interview. Try to keep your list concise, say three or four of your most important ques-
tions. The questions you ask reflect just as much about you as the answers you give to the 
interviewer’s questions. Here is a sample of appropriate questions for the initial interview:
 
• “Could you clarify a certain aspect of the job responsibilities for me?”
 • “Do people who start in entry-level jobs at this company tend to develop their careers here?”
 • “In what ways could I perform above and beyond the job requirements?”
At some point during your conversation, the interviewer may give you an idea of the sal-
ary range for the job. If not, he or she will do so during a subsequent interview. You may ask 
about the range, but do not ask exactly how much you will be paid if you get the job. Keep 
in mind that usually there is little or no negotiation of an entry-level salary. However, you 
may ask if there is a probationary period with a review at the end of the period. Here are a 
few other questions not to ask:
 
• “When will I be promoted?”
 • “How much time off do I get?”
 • “When will I get my first raise?”
 • “How many people are applying for this job?”
 • “What are my chances of getting this job?”
At the end of the interview, be sure to thank the interviewer with a smile and a handshake, 
even if you both know the job is not for you. Again, another opportunity may come along in 
the future and you want to leave the door open. When you get home, write a note or e-mail 
the interviewer, thanking him or her for time spent with you. Thank-you notes really do make 
a lasting impression on a person, and it gives you another chance to reinforce your interest.
A successful first interview often leads to a second. The purpose of this interview is to 
better determine your specific qualifications and fit with the company. You may be intro-
duced to more people—potential coworkers, people in other divisions, or sales staff. You 
may have another meeting with human resource staff members in which you’ll learn more 
about salary, employee benefits, the firm’s code of ethics, and the like. Depending on the 
type of job, you might be asked to take some skills tests. If you are entering a training pro-
gram for a bank, you might be required to take some math-oriented tests. If you are going to 
work for a publisher, you might be asked to take an editing test or do some proofreading. If 
you are applying for a job as a sales representative, you may be given a test that assesses your 
personality traits. Don’t be intimidated by these tests—you are not expected to know every-
thing or be perfect—just do your best.
Making the Employment Decision
After receiving your résumé, conducting one or two interviews, and administering a 
skills test, a potential employer knows a lot about you. You should also know a lot about the 
company. If the experience has been positive on both sides, you may be offered a job. If you 
have interviewed at several companies and are offered more than one job, congratulations! 
You may receive a phone call, followed by a letter outlining the offer in writing. Whether 

A-69
Appendix E
you receive one offer or several, thank the person making the offer. If you 
choose to accept immediately, feel free to do so. If you have doubts about 
the job or need to decide between two, it is appropriate to ask for 24 hours 
to respond. If you must decline an offer, do so promptly and politely. After 
all, you may end up working for that firm sometime in the future. If you 
get a few rejections before you receive an offer, don’t give up. Every appli-
cation and interview adds to your experience.
As you think about an offer, consider the aspects that are most impor-
tant. You’ll want to choose a job that comes closest to your career interests 
and objectives. But don’t rule out the element of surprise—you might 
wind up with a job you like in an industry you’d never considered before. 
Don’t worry too much about the salary. The point of an entry-level job is 
to set you on a forward path. And keep in mind that your first job won’t 
be your last. Once you have accepted an offer, you’ll be given a start date 
as well as the name of the person to whom you should report on arrival. 
Congratulations, you are now a member of the workforce!
Nontraditional Students
Take a quick glance around your class. You’ll likely see classmates of 
all ages. Some will fall into the traditional college age group of 18 to 22, 
but many don’t. Perhaps you are a veteran returning from military duty 
overseas. Maybe you have been engaged in a full-time career but want to 
broaden your education. Students who fall outside the 18- to 22-year-old 
age group are often referred to as nontraditional students, but these students 
have become the norm on many campuses. Homemakers returning to school to freshen 
up their résumés before returning to the workforce and workers who have been laid off 
due to an economic downturn are other examples of nontraditional students. As diverse 
as this group is, they share one thing in common: they are older than traditional students. 
This means that they face different challenges—but also enjoy some advantages over their 
younger classmates.
One major challenge faced by nontraditional students is scheduling. Often they are jug-
gling the responsibilities of work, school, and family. They may have to study at odd times—
during meals, while commuting, or after putting the kids to bed. If they are switching careers, 
they may be learning an entirely new set of skills, as well. But nontraditional students have 
an important advantage: experience. Even experience in an unrelated field is a plus. Older 
students know how organizations operate. Often, they have developed useful skills in human 
relations, management, budgeting, and communications. Even a former stay-home parent has 
skills in all of these areas. Through observing other people’s successes and failures—as well as 
living through their own—they have developed an inventory of what to do and what not to 
do. So, in some ways, these students have a head start on their younger counterparts. But they 
also face the reality that they have fewer years in which to develop a career.
The Job Market: 
Where Do You Fit In?
The industry you choose, and the career you follow within it, are part of a bigger pic-
ture. They reflect the needs of society, changing populations, developing technology, and 
the overall economy. For instance, the U.S. population is expected to increase at a slower

Congratulations! You’ve accepted an offer for your first 
job. You are now a member of the workforce.

rate of growth for the foreseeable future than during the previous two decades. The U.S. 
workforce will continue to become more diverse, with Hispanics accounting for the largest 
share of jobs among minorities, while Asians represent the fastest-growing group of employ-
ees. The size of the Hispanic workforce is expected to increase from 14 percent to 17 per-
cent. White, non-Hispanic workers will make up a declining share of the workforce, falling 
from approximately 69 percent to about 65 percent.13
The number of women in the workforce is growing at a faster rate than that of men. 
The male labor force is expected to grow by 7.5 percent by the year 2018, compared with 
almost 9 percent for women. So the men’s share of the labor force will likely continue to 
decrease, while the women’s share will increase.14
All of these facts combine to shape a picture of the needs of U.S. society and the work-
force available to serve it. As the Baby Boom generation ages, the age group between 55 
and 64 will increase by about one third. Thus, the United States will need more healthcare 
services, as well as other services for an aging population, such as assisted living facilities 
and leisure and hospitality. The group between the ages 35 and 44 will decrease by almost 6 
percent, while the youth population between 16 and 24 will decline by about 1 percent. But 
today’s younger workers are receiving more education and training to fill the need for pro-
fessional and business service workers. These projections affect both the workforce and the 
types of goods and services needed to satisfy consumers. So jobs in education and healthcare 
services will increase by more than 5 million and in professional and business services by a 
little more than 4 million.15
Careers in service-providing industries continue a long-term rise. Service jobs in health-
care and social assistance will increase by about 26 percent by the year 2018, while manufac-
turing jobs will continue to shrink. But industries that produce certain types of goods, such 
as those related to the needs of an aging population and those related to green technologies 
or products, will probably increase.16
The good news is that even in a weaker job market, employers are looking to hire 
recent college graduates. In fact, some continue to offer signing bonuses and other 
incentives in order to secure the best workers. Why? Continuing to hire entry-level 
employees makes good business sense. The National Associate of Colleges and Employers 
(NACE) reports that college hiring is actually on the rise.17 Some of the hot jobs can be 
found in accounting, sales, management training, engineering, and business services. So 
celebrate your graduation, and keep your résumé current and your outlook positive: a job is 
out there for you.
A Long-Range View 
of Your Career
Choosing a career is an important life decision. A career is a professional journey—
regardless of whether you want to run a small restaurant or a branch bank, whether you are 
fascinated by language or math, whether you prefer to work with animals or people. In the 
end, you hope to contribute something good to society while enjoying what you do—and 
make a reasonable living at it.
Throughout your career, it is important to stay flexible and continue learning. 
Challenging new skills will be required of managers and other businesspeople during these 
first decades of the 21st century. Remain open to unexpected changes and opportunities that 
can help you learn and develop new skills. Keep in mind that your first job will not be your 
last. But tackle that first job with the same enthusiasm you’d have if someone asked you to 

A-71
Appendix E
run the company itself, because everything you learn on that job will be valuable at some 
point during your career—and someday you may actually run the company.
Finally, if you haven’t already started your career search, begin now. Do this by talking 
with various resources, lining up an internship, looking for a part-time job on or off campus, 
or volunteering for an organization. Register with the campus career center long before you 
graduate. Then, when you reach your final semester, you’ll be well on your way to beginning 
the career you want.
We are confident that this textbook presents a panorama of career options for you. 
Whatever you decide, be sure it is right for you—not your friends, your instructors, or your 
parents. As the old saying goes, “You pass this way just once.” Enjoy the journey!
More Career Information on the Contemporary 
Business Web Site
More career information is available to students using Contemporary Business at the 
book’s Web site.
The “Management Careers” section on the Web site enables you to learn more about 
business careers and to locate currently posted job opportunities. The site provides a vast 
number of career resources such as links to job sites, career guidance sites, and the like. Also, 
many links include extensive career information and guidance, such as interviewing tech-
niques and tips for résumé writing.
Projects and Teamwork Applications
1. Visit one of the job Web sites such as CareerBuilder or 
Monster and research an industry in which you think you 
might be interested. Prepare a report on what you learned 
about the field. Was the site helpful? What types of jobs 
were available in the field? Based on your report, do you 
plan to pursue this industry or select another field?
2. Prepare your résumé following the procedures outlined ear-
lier in this section. Exchange your résumé with a classmate 
so you can critique each other’s resume. Then revise and 
proofread your résumé.
3. Go online to the Web site for a specific company for which 
you might be interested in working. Click on the “Careers” 
or “Job Opportunities” section of the site, and read carefully 
the job descriptions for any entry-level positions and the 
procedure for applying for them. Also review any general 
information about career development at the firm. Write a 
cover letter as if you were actually applying for one of the 
jobs.
4. With a classmate, practice interviewing for the job you 
selected in the previous question. Prepare questions for each 
other and take turns interviewing and being interviewed. 
What parts of the interview did you handle well? What 
could you improve?
5. Think about where you would like to be in your career in 
five years and write about your plans. Share your plans with 
the class, then seal them in an envelope. Keep the envelope 
and open it in five years to see how close you came to your 
predictions.
