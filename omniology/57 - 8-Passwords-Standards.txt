Passwords Standards 
 
When your account is issued, you will be given an initial password. It is important for system and 
personal security that the password for your account be changed to something of your choosing. The 
command for changing a password is "passwd". You will be asked both for your old password and to 
type your new selected password twice. If you mistype your old password or do not type your new 
password the same way twice, the system will indicate that the password has not been changed. 
Some system administrators have installed programs that check for appropriateness of password (is it 
cryptic enough for reasonable system security). A password change may be rejected by this program. 
When choosing a password, it is important that it be something that could not be guessed -- either by 
somebody unknown to you trying to break in, or by an acquaintance who knows you. Suggestions for 
choosing and using a password follow: 
 
Don't  
use a word (or words) in any language 
use a proper name 
use information that can be found in your wallet 
use information commonly known about you (car license, pet name, etc) 
use control characters. Some systems can't handle them 
write your password anywhere 
ever give your password to *anybody* 
 
Do 
use a mixture of character types (alphabetic, numeric, special) 
use a mixture of upper case and lower case 
use at least 6 characters 
choose a password you can remember 
change your password often 
make sure nobody is looking over your shoulder when you are entering your password
