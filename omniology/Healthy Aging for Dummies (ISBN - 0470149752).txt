About the Authors
Brent J. Agin, MD, has been in private practice for the last five years and is
recognized by the community as the go-to medical advisor in the field of
healthy aging. He sees patients of all ages and maintains a diverse array of
clientele, including professional athletes and celebrities. He’s board certified
in family medicine, receiving both his undergraduate degree and his MD at
Michigan State University. He completed his internship and residency at the
University of South Florida.
Dr. Agin offers family medicine, but his practice also provides aesthetics and
weight loss assistance. He’s the medical director of Novus Medical Detox,
which provides private detoxification for multiple addictions. With a strong
interest in nutrition, he’s developed a supplement line and all-natural, rapid
weight loss program, The TRIM Diet (www.trimlifestyle.com), while
doing dietary and weight-loss consulting nationally.
In his free time, Dr. Agin enjoys golf, soccer, and fishing. He lives in Palm
Harbor, Florida, with his wife Cindy and their two daughters.
Sharon Perkins is an RN with over 20 years of experience and an author 
of six For Dummies series books. She enjoys both jobs equally but enjoys 
her three grandchildren, five children, two daughters-in-law, one son-in-law,
family, and friends more! She lives in New Jersey but spends a lot of time 
gallivanting around the country.


Dedication
We dedicate this book to all the readers who are going to make positive
changes in their lives. In the book, we offer a lot of information and tips 
to improve your lifestyle and health; all you have to do is go for it! Feeling
healthy is the goal, and this book is your motivation. To date, whether it’s
mental or physical health, neither of us has ever met a person who hasn’t
been able to get healthier if he or she tried. Conversely, the people who’ve
really put their hearts and souls into the effort have beat odds time and 
again and have achieved amazing personal goals. So here’s to you and to 
the rest of your healthy lives!
Authors’ Acknowledgments
From Dr. Agin: I would like to thank the coauthor Sharon Perkins, my literary
agent Barb Doyen, and the team at Wiley Publishing. With these folks’ help I
was able to accomplish a major goal in my life. For this, I acknowledge their
guidance and patience and thank them dearly for the opportunity. I would also
like to thank my family, friends, and co-workers for their support.
From Sharon Perkins: I think my list of people to thank grows longer with
every book I write. I thank everyone who’s had to help me through some
tough times in the last year (you all know who you are), and I thank God 
and my agent, Jessica Faust, for the opportunity to write this book and take
my mind off a difficult situation. Thanks also to Kristin DeMint, our Project
Editor, to our Copy Editors — Pam Ruble, Carrie Burchfield, and Sarah
Faulkner — and to the rest of the Wiley team; I always enjoy working with 
all of you. And to Brent, who made this job easy.

Introduction
I
f you’re like many folks today, you realize that not only are people living
longer than they used to, but also some of those people are living amazingly
well while looking great. What’s their secret to living such an independent,
active, and radiant lifestyle? The answer lies in their healthy lifestyles — an
approach to life we revisit multiple times in this book. The goal of this book is
to educate you on the healthy choices you can make that reward you with a
healthier, longer, happier life.
Some of the greatest threats to healthy aging come from disease and illnesses
that cut your life short and the unhealthy choices that may have caused
them. The good news is you can prevent many of these illnesses. Consider
these facts:
 Nearly 80 million U.S. adults have some form of cardiovascular disease
(CVD), and someone in the U.S. dies every 36 seconds from CVD.
 More than 20 million people have diabetes, and adults with diabetes die
from heart disease at a rate two to four times higher than adults without
diabetes.
 Heart disease and stroke account for about 65 percent of deaths in
people with diabetes.
 Nearly 70 percent of Americans are overweight and more than 30 percent
are obese.
These statistics focus on only a few health conditions, but we could give you
similar numbers for many other ailments that people encounter as they get
older. Wonder where all these statistics come from? In this book, many of the
statistics we quote are from the World Health Organization (WHO), so if we
don’t cite a source, you can assume that WHO is it. So with this information
in mind, take a look at some of the secrets to healthy aging. Here are a few
keys to success:
 Prevention: By arming yourself with solid knowledge and making
changes to your current lifestyle, you won’t necessarily live longer
(although you may), but you will live a better quality of life.
 Moderation: Easy does it and in small doses. Making small but significant
changes in your life can make a difference over time.
 Timing: Start now! Whether you are 20-something or 70-something, you
are the CEO of your body, and it’s up to you to manage it.

 Practice: Much of the way you live is based on habits — some good,
some bad — formed over a lifetime. Incorporating new routines in place
of old habits takes some getting used to. In time and with consistent
practice, these lifestyle changes can replace old habits and become
second nature.
It’s never too early or too late to start taking care of your body. The sooner
you treat your body as if it’s the only one you’re going to get, the sooner
you’re on your way to healthy aging. Your body needs continuous respect
and appreciation and if treated well can provide a wonderful, healthy life.
About This Book
This book is an excellent choice if you want to maximize your body’s poten-
tial now and for as long as you own it. Whether you want to make a small
adjustment, need some fine-tuning, or have to make a major overhaul, you
find helpful advice in the pages of this book.
Our goal is to lay out the reasons why your body ages, explain the normal
course of aging, and show you how aging is accelerated by your lifestyle
choices. We’ve also given you information on how to prevent or reverse the
effects of aging, disease, and illness.
You may be a 20-something looking for some tips on strength training and
nutrition, while also wanting to know how to prevent illness while you’re still
young. On the other hand, you could be in early retirement or even beyond
that point, looking to recreate the energy and great health you had when you
were younger, while getting up to date on the important preventative health
exams. Either way, we present you with useful material in an easy-to-follow
fashion to help you achieve your goals. If you happen to be passionate about
a particular topic (like muscles or nutrition), don’t worry — we cover every
subject in detail and even refer you to other For Dummies books in case you
just can’t get enough!
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate easily through this book, we set up a few conventions
used consistently throughout the book:
 Anytime we want to highlight new words or terms defined in the text, we
italicize them.
 Boldfaced text is used to indicate the action part of numbered steps and
the keywords of a bulleted list.
 We use monofont for Web sites and e-mail addresses.

Healthy Aging For Dummies 

When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to
break across two lines of text. If you come across these instances, rest
assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as a hyphen)
to indicate the break. So, when typing one of these Web addresses in a
Web browser, just type in exactly what you see, pretending as if the line
break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
That’s right — you don’t have to read this book cover-to-cover to find helpful
information. Any text you find in a gray box is a sidebar. Sidebars contain
interesting but unessential information. If you’re in a hurry to get to the meat
of the chapter, feel free to skip them and return to them later. Another area
you can skip over, if you wish, are the places marked with a Technical Stuff
icon. If you’re the type who wants to know all the technical details, you’ll
enjoy these two areas; otherwise you can move on without missing essential
information.
Foolish Assumptions
This book is for anyone who wants to live a healthier life, and we figure that
means just about everyone! If you’ve picked up this book, we assume you fall
into one or more of these categories:
 You’re alive and want to stay that way for awhile, and you want to do so
disease- and illness-free, as independent as possible, and with your mind
as sharp as a tack.
 You’re having some health issues and are willing to make some modifica-
tions to your lifestyle to be healthier but aren’t sure what to do.
 You have no interest in reading a dry medical textbook; you want an
easy-to-follow reference book with some helpful “how-to’s” and “show-
me-the-ways.”
 You want a book that gives you the straight facts about what you need
to know about how your body and mind work in order to make wise
choices for healthy living, as well as how to adapt your lifestyle choices
according to your age.
 You want to get a few laughs while you digest the information, because
aging isn’t always so easy to cope with.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
Healthy Aging For Dummies is organized into six parts. Each part addresses a
major area of the hows, whats, and whys of healthy aging. Because of this
organization, it’s simple to find the topic that you’re looking for. Here’s a
quick overview of what you can find in each part.
Part I: So You Want to Look 
and Feel Young Forever . . .
If you want something badly enough, you must be willing to work for it.
There’s no Fountain of Youth, and there’s no free lunch, either. In these chap-
ters, you find out how to assess your current health, evaluate your chal-
lenges and strengths, and set your mark on what you desire most. More
importantly, we show you how to achieve your goals.
Part II: Workin’ on Your Framework
The chapters in this part discuss the fundamentals of caring for your perma-
nent fixtures and structures, such your teeth, skin, and joints. As for your
teeth, tooth loss is not solely a sign of aging — it’s often a sign of poor dental
hygiene, so we tell you what to do to keep those choppers for life. Your skin
is your body’s first line of defense against disease and illness, so protect it
and care for it. We tell you how. We also fill you in on why bones become
weak and brittle as the years pass, what lifestyle factors accelerate this
process, and what you can do to prevent it.
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend
Your Expiration Date
Your body uses food as fuel to operate at maximum efficiency. The better the
fuel, the better your body runs. While your body can survive on a diet of
French fries, soda, processed meats, and cream-filled pastries, you pay a price.
This part provides you with guidelines for using nutrition and supplements to
help your body perform at its best for the long haul.

Part IV: Getting Physical
The human body is meant to move, and most people don’t use their bodies to
their full capabilities. Your muscles ache to be worked to the point of fatigue
in order to rebuild and do it all over again. This part aims to get you excited
about revving up your body to do what it craves. In turn, your body serves
you well in the long run.
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important
Mind and Spirit
For many folks, losing their memory (or their mind) is one of the biggest con-
cerns of getting older. In this section, we explain the differences between
normal memory loss and memory loss due to disease, how to improve your
memory, and how maintaining an upbeat outlook on life positively influences
your overall health and well-being.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part presents helpful information in lists of ten items each. You can read
about ten myths and get the facts behind them. Find the ten proven most
healthy foods, play ten mind games to stretch your brain power, and discover
ways to make your home safer as you age.
In addition, we threw in a handy Appendix with a questionnaire to help you
and your doctor determine your current state of health. From there, you can
create a roadmap for healthy living.
Icons Used in This Book
This book uses icons — small graphics or images in the margins — to mark
certain paragraphs of information that you may find useful. Here’s the run-
down of the helpful icons we use in this book.
When you see this icon, you’ll find a helpful hint about doing something to
help you age gracefully.
5
Introduction

This icon denotes critical information that you need to take away with you.
Be sure to read it.
Once in a while, we go a bit deeper into the info on aging. This icon tips you
off to that type of information. You can skip over these icons and still be able
to age with perfection, but the info they contain enhances your understand-
ing of healthy aging ever further.
The Warning icon cautions you against something that’s potentially harmful.
Be sure to read and heed the information with these icons.
Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to start at Chapter 1 and read straight through this book. Just
like all For Dummies books, this one is set up so you can read any chapter, in
any order, and still come out ahead. Sound good? Then keep on reading.
(Starting wherever you want, of course.)
We’re partial to this book and would love for you to read the whole thing, but
if you don’t have the time to do so (or just don’t feel like it), we recommend
that you make sure to read Chapter 3, because we believe it’s one of the most
critical chapters in the whole book. It covers what you should know about
your family’s health history, what checkups you need when, and how to
create a plan for healthy aging. We encourage you to check out why setting
goals and creating a plan is so vital. After you have your goals and an action
plan in place, you can better use the information in this book. We’ll be with
you every step of the way.

and how can you maneuver around them?
In this part, we reveal the secrets to looking and feeling
younger so you can evaluate your health, habits, and 
wellness goals.

Chapter 1
The Fountain of Youth, 
at Your Fingertips
In This Chapter
 Understanding the current life expectancy
 Uncovering proven methods to combat aging
 Looking at the staggering numbers of preventable deaths
O
ver the years, thousands of people have searched for the elusive Fountain
of Youth, and although some have claimed to have found it, for most, it
remains a hidden treasure. Great strides have been made in uncovering the
secrets to aging healthfully and lengthening the lifespan, but there’s still progress
to be made. As much as you may wish otherwise, most people know there’s no
magic pill for good health and longevity. It takes commitment, work, and some-
times even denial of self — giving up poor eating habits, couch potato lifestyle,
and the stressful schedules so many are addicted to — to stay healthy as you
get older. You may be taking care of the externals but skipping over the basics
of good health, which are also the basics of aging well.
You can’t skip over the basics so easily, though. Balance is a big key in life,
and healthy aging is no different. Skipping over essential healthcare is like
ignoring routine maintenance on your car — the end result can be costly and
dangerous.
Healthy aging is a current hot topic, and you can thank the baby boomer
generation — the oldest of these people are now heading into their 60s — for
today’s emphasis on youthful, healthy aging. In this chapter, we discuss why
people are living longer and better today than in previous generations, what
impacted life expectancy a century ago, and what impacts our health and
longevity today.

Life Expectancy in the 21st Century
The last 100 years have seen a tremendous change in the way people live and
the ailments they fall prey to. The epidemics of yesterday have been wiped
out in industrialized countries, and life expectancy has increased. But even
though folks are living longer today, this life expectancy brings a whole new
set of problems and solutions.
Today, many folks take for granted that they’ll live into adulthood, while in
the past, people were well aware of the unpredictable threats on their lives.
Some of the most damaging health threats in the world today can be modified
by lifestyle choices. Making healthy choices is the basis of healthy aging and
the recurrent theme of this book.
To examine why people live longer lives today, you must first look at why
people didn’t live as long more than a century ago. This section focuses on
the differences.
That was then . . .
Malnutrition, acute illnesses, infant mortality, and war were major contributors
to shorter life expectancy 100 years ago. In the period of 1918 to 1919, the
influenza virus (the flu) infected more than 400 million people worldwide and
killed nearly 40 million. Today people still die from the flu, but not nearly at
the mortality rates common in the past.
Poor living conditions and poor sanitation were also major causes of death.
Each incident people experienced had a negative cumulative effect on their
health. Even diseases that didn’t result in death left people more likely to
develop chronic illnesses when they grew older and lead to poor life
expectancy.
The statistical probability of a person 100 years ago going through life
unscathed was extremely low. Here are a few of the problems that caused
widespread disease and mortality then:
 Crowded and unsanitary living conditions: These scenarios resulted in
multiple outbreaks of malaria, cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, yellow
fever, and flu. Survivors often faced lifelong health consequences.
 War: War caused death directly and also exposed soldiers to foreign
disease. During the American Civil War between 1861 and 1865 there
were twice as many deaths from disease associated with the poor health
than from battle wounds. More than 200 million people died in the
beginning of the 20th century from a combination of combat and disease.
10
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

 Viral and bacterial infections with no medical treatments or vaccines:
Viruses and bacteria infections caused death in high numbers of both
adults and children. Worldwide there have been many pandemics
(affecting a large group, even the world) from the Spanish Flu in 1918 to
the Asian Flu in 1957 that killed more than 50 million people. Polio,
smallpox, diphtheria, and measles killed many adults and children
before the advent of vaccines and still do in third world countries.
 Hazardous work environments and hard physical labor: Starting as
young as age 13, exposed to dangerous fumes and bacteria, and with
minimal protective equipment, people worked 10- to 12-hour shifts. The
number of work-related deaths peaked around 1900 and then started to
improve with the formation of unions and other safety requirements.
 Lack of certain nutrients: People from soldiers to sailors as well as
malnutrition in the poverty stricken suffered from lack of nutrients.
These deficiencies included
• Pellagra: A deficiency of niacin (b3) that may include symptoms of
dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and death.
• Goiter: Goiter is caused by a lack of iodine in a child’s diet that can
lead to hyperthyroidism (elevated thyroid hormone). Complications
include heart problems, impaired mental function, and birth defects.
• Scurvy: Lack of vitamin C led to scurvy, a condition where the
body can’t properly absorb iron, causing anemia.
• Rickets: This affliction was due to a lack of vitamin D, which is
necessary for bone mineralization. Children with rickets had bones
that didn’t fully develop and were deformed, often with the classic
bowing of the legs. Kids were also more susceptible to whooping
cough and measles.
. . . This is now
There has been a change in the major health concerns today versus 100 years
ago, but globally, some similarities still exist. Worldwide, infectious disease is
still a major cause of death, and the threat of newer strains of viruses and
bacteria are always present. In addition, the mutation of “superbugs” that 
are immune to many antibiotics has been created by overuse of antibiotics.
Major medical discoveries and inventions have improved the outcomes of
many conditions by earlier diagnosis and better medications and treatments,
but lifestyle changes have resulted in the current prevalence of chronic and
often preventable diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, respiratory illness,
diabetes, and stroke, which have the highest mortality rates today (see
Chapter 2 for more info).
11
Chapter 1: The Fountain of Youth, at Your Finger Tips

Over the years, medical advances have fueled the changes that have overcome
some major health threats to society. Here is the list of major contributors:
 Infant vaccinations: Today, over 80 percent of children age three or
younger receive vaccinations. As a result, some of the deadly diseases,
like smallpox and polio, are completely controlled in developed coun-
tries, while worldwide programs try to spread this success into the
underdeveloped countries. Furthermore, new vaccines are available
(like for chicken pox) that weren’t available 30 years ago. People born in
1955 were the first to receive vaccinations in infancy, starting with polio.
That factor alone significantly increased that generation’s lifespan. In the
years to follow, more childhood vaccines were added, such as measles
in 1963, mumps in 1967, and rubella in 1969.
 Antibiotics: People have been receiving antibiotics since the 1940s for
bacterial infections, such as syphilis, tuberculosis, malaria, and pneumo-
nia. Penicillin was discovered in 1928 and first used medically in 1940.
After the discovery of penicillin, the rate of development of newer antibi-
otics was paralleled by fear of emerging resistant bacteria. In the 1950s,
new resistant bacteria emphasized the need to limit use of antibiotics to
keep new resistant bacteria for emerging. Today, the improper use of
antibiotics is widespread, leaving researchers nervous about the
inevitable development of newer resistant bugs. Follow your doctor’s
recommendation about taking antibiotics seriously to help avoid further
resistant strains from improper antibiotic use.
 Medical technology: Medical technology drives the improvements in
modern medicine. To make better medications, vaccines, and diagnostic
tests, there needs to be advances in equipment to identify and create
them. Diagnosing disease in its early stages, which improves outcome,
comes from better diagnostic imaging. Patients with disease that has
advanced to a point where organs are failing are given hope from tech-
nology advancements in prosthetics, organ transplantation, and tissue
repair. Here are a few of the major breakthroughs:
• The artificial heart can be used to keep heart failure patients alive
until they can receive a donor heart.
• Computer-aided tomography (CAT) scan produces three-dimen-
sional images of the body that can show doctors whether a tumor
is present and how deep it is in the body, to guide diagnosis and
treatments.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is when magnetic fields and
radio waves cause atoms to give off tiny radio signals, making it
possible to detect cancer and other ailments early.
Despite these amazing advances, some diseases are still constant — cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) is still the leading cause of death in the world, and
although cancer, respiratory illness, and diabetes all trail behind, they’re still
major health threats (see Chapter 2 for more info on cancer and CVD).

The Basics of Pro-Aging: The Best
Actions You Can Take
You can’t prevent the passage of time, but when you’re proactive about your
life choices, you can control some of the risk factors in your life associated
with illness and disease. Being proactive doesn’t automatically guarantee you
won’t develop a chronic disease or illness, but not doing anything or actively
taking part in known risk factors that are linked to chronic disease or illness
may lead to health problems.
You may not realize just how much control you have over how long you live —
and we don’t necessarily mean that in a good way. Seemingly casual choices
you make every day may have the most profound impact on your health. In
fact, it’s estimated that if everyone in the United States led a healthy lifestyle
(outlined in the list below), more than 50 percent of the cases of cardiovascular
disease and diabetes could be avoided, and more than 50 percent of all cases
of cancer prevented.
The earlier in life you choose to follow a lifestyle of disease prevention, the
more you can lower your risks of developing chronic disease. Chronic disease
and illness come from many different factors, some of which you can control —
such as lifestyle choices — and others you can’t — like your age and genetics.
The following tips show you how to avoid the most damaging and pre-
ventable threats to your health and aging:
 Don’t smoke — and if you already do, stop. Really. Smoking increases
the risks for the top three killers: heart disease, cancer, and cardiovascular
ailments, including strokes. It also damages your lungs and other parts
of your respiratory system. At least 60 chemicals in cigarette smoke cause
cancer, and as a cigarette burns, it produces the poisons carbon monoxide,
ammonia, formaldehyde, arsenic, and cyanide.
Smoking raises your blood pressure and decreases the flow of oxygen to
your brain and body. It’s also a significant risk factor for other health
concerns, including emphysema, chronic bronchitis, stroke, and osteo-
porosis. (See Chapter 2 for more info on smoking; Chapter 6 for
osteoporosis.) In the year 2006, smoking resulted in 435,000 deaths or
18.1 percent of the total deaths (includes 35,000 deaths from second-
hand smoke and 1,000 infant deaths due to maternal smoking).
 Limit alcohol consumption. If you drink alcohol, no more than two
drinks a day are safe for men, and one or fewer drinks a day for women.
(A standard drink is one 12-ounce bottle of beer or wine cooler, one 5-
ounce glass of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits.) Women
are more likely to have liver damage from drinking two or more drinks a
day than men are, so it’s especially important for women to keep alcohol
consumption to one or fewer drinks a day.

The high cost of free radicals
Free radicals can come from internal reactions
or can be caused by external sources such as
exposure to X-rays, cigarette smoking, air pol-
lutants, pesticides, and other industrial chemi-
cals. To understand free radicals, it helps to
understand cell structure.
The human body is made up of cells. Cells are
made up of molecules. Molecules consist of
elements (water, calcium, iron), and elements
are composed of atoms (made of a nucleus,
neutrons, protons, and electrons). Atoms are
bound by a chemical bond created by pairs of
electrons that surround the atom. The number
of protons (positive charge) in the atom’s
nucleus (center) determines the number of
electrons (negative charge) that surround the
atom. Electrons by nature are unstable and
have a tendency to break away from the atom,
leaving it with an unpaired electron. This
unpaired electron turns the atom into a free rad-
ical, which becomes a scavenger looking for an
available electron to stabilize itself. Free radi-
cals steal electrons from other atoms, making
these atoms, with missing electrons, become
free radicals, and this sets off an ugly chain
reaction (see the following figure). With time,
free radicals cause damage to the cell structure
and the cells die. Tissue that’s continuously
assaulted by free radicals leads to cell death,
which leads to more rapid aging. Free radicals
are known to be linked to cancer, heart disease,
arthritis, and other disease.
Antioxidants work by targeting free radicals and
donating one of their electrons to each free rad-
ical (a process called oxidation), neutralizing it,
and preventing damage to the body’s tissues
(see the following figure).

Alcohol is a depressant and can exacerbate the symptoms of depression
and other mental disturbances. Alcohol intoxication causes problems
with coordination, speech, and decision making, leading to risky behaviors.
At toxic levels of alcohol intake, vomiting, difficult breathing, seizures,
and even death can occur. Alcohol has an addiction potential, with
around 8 percent of adults having an alcohol use disorder. With addiction
and chronic alcohol consumption, disease in the liver, pancreas, nervous
system, and gastrointestinal system can occur. If you’ve had any history
of addiction to alcohol or any other substance, you shouldn’t drink at all.
Many studies have found that consumption of alcohol at these quantities
can have protective measures in cardiovascular disease. Consumption of
red wine may be particularly favorable, since red wine contains certain
polyphenol antioxidants associated with cardiovascular health.
If you’re pregnant, you should avoid alcohol altogether because
researchers don’t know how much alcohol will harm a fetus, but they do
know that a certain amount can be extremely harmful.
 Maintain a healthy, balanced diet. We can’t overstate the importance of
a balanced and healthy diet as you age. A poor diet can lead to an increased
risk of many health problems, including osteoporosis, heart disease, and
impaired memory. Eating well, on the other hand, makes you feel and
look better, keeps your body functioning optimally, wards off colds and
sickness, and contributes to lowering blood pressure and cholesterol
levels, which in turn helps protect you against heart disease and stroke.
(Chapter 7 tells more about good nutrition.)

 Exercise regularly. Over time, a sedentary lifestyle can lead to obesity, a
preventable yet dangerous epidemic that poses a threat to people’s
longevity. And it’s on the rise. As you age, regular exercise should be a
cornerstone of healthy living. As your body slows down, you may be
tempted to skip the exercise because it’s harder to do, you feel challenged
physically, or you accept that being less active is part of normal aging.
Don’t fall prey to this thinking!
As you get older, exercise doesn’t need to be strenuous, it just needs to
be consistent. Regular physical activity helps your body function more
effectively. (See Chapters 9 and 10 for more info on activity and exercise.)
 Manage your stress and develop healthy coping mechanisms. Stress
causes the release of the hormones cortisol, norepinephrine, and epi-
nephrine, which under acute stress have a protective effect on the body.
But chronic stress allows hormones to hang around longer than usual
and cause the formation of free radicals. (See Chapter 13 for more infor-
mation on the effects of stress.) Although these little buggers don’t
cause death directly, they do contribute to aging. Check out the nearby
sidebar, “The high cost of free radicals.”
 Get enough sleep regularly. You need sleep, both psychologically and
physiologically. The body uses this time for healing and growth, and
your body produces many hormones essential for proper functioning
during the deepest sleep stages. Sleep irregularity can have a direct
impact on some disorders, such as epilepsy and migraines, and has been
associated with diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, clinical
depression, diabetes, and other serious conditions. (See Chapter 14 for
more on sleep.)
 Visit your doctor for the recommended screening tests for your age.
Several important tests can help protect against cancer, heart disease,
stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Some of these tests find diseases
early, when they’re most treatable, while others can actually help keep a
disease from developing in the first place. (See Chapter 2 to find out
which tests you should have and when.)
If Staying Young and Healthy Is So Easy,
Why Isn’t Everyone Doing It?
There’s nothing terribly complicated about living a healthy, life-prolonging
lifestyle. So why are more people falling prey to partially preventable diseases
every year? In this section, we explore what we think are the biggest reasons
behind the staggering numbers of preventable death. Take these pointers to
heart, so you can recognize any that may be present in your own life and
make the modifications to effectively enhance the quality of your life, both
now and in the future, no matter what your age.
16
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

Short-sighted thinking
We’re going to let you in on a little secret, everyone is mortal. Despite this
being common knowledge, few people think about the inevitability of their
own death and the things they can do to prevent it from happening prema-
turely. If they did, there would be far fewer accidents of every type, no one
would ever break their hip falling off a ladder they shouldn’t have been on in
the first place, and cigarette sales would plummet.
The idea that death can be postponed leads to thinking that “tomorrow” is a
good time to start a dietary overhaul, an ambitious new exercise regimen,
and, of course, tomorrow is the best time to quit smoking and drinking. For
many people, tomorrow is also a good time to finally call and set up the routine
physical or breast exam they’ve been avoiding for the past five years.
We’re not advocating that you get out the sackcloth and ashes and carry a
sign that states “The End is Near,” but a little realism can go a long way
toward a new way of living that can literally save lives — at least for a few
more years.
How can you inject enough realism to make you want to change but not so
much that you feel it’s all too futile anyway? The following ideas may help:
 Take a quiz. There are online sites that allow you to input your health
information and get a prediction of how long you’ll live. Seeing your
projected timeline in black and white may be enough to get you
motivated to make changes. One such site is www.livingto100.com.
 Pay attention to how you feel. Often the little nagging symptoms that
can signal something big brewing are ignored. One way to keep track of
what’s going on with your health is to keep a journal. Don’t do this if
you’re already obsessed with your health — most likely you already
keep track of your symptoms. Do this only if you’re the type of person
that ignores warning signs like shortness of breath, chest pain, or
headaches. You may see a pattern that needs to be addressed.
 See your doctor. Make it clear when you make the appointment that this
isn’t a “sick” visit but rather a consultation, so more time is allotted. Ask
him what you can do to improve your health, and then do it.
Many people have joined a “managed care” system where there are limi-
tations on treatments and a focus on cutting costs, often leaving individ-
uals managing their own care. The plethora of health information on the
Internet (not all accurate, but abundant) leads people to self-diagnosing
or making their own clinical decisions based on information they find on
the Internet. It’s not bad to be informed, but it can be dangerous if this
information is replacing doctor visits.

Confusing what feels good 
with what is good
Making healthy food choices can have a major impact on health and aging.
Most people know some of the fundamental eating habits that should be
avoided such as eating fried foods and high sugar content snacks. Those
same people also know that fruits and vegetables are good for you. Then why
are so many people unable to make the decision to eat the way they know
they should?
Could it be that some people’s inability to stop eating poorly is an addiction,
similar to addictions to tobacco and alcohol? More likely, it’s the cavalier
attitude many people have about their health that keeps them eating poorly,
until they’re slapped in the face with the reality of poor health. You may have
heard the saying “cancer is the cure for smoking.” Well, you would think diabetes
and heart disease would be the cure for obesity . . . but sadly, they often aren’t.
This battle is never ending in the medical profession. Moving to healthy eating
habits is difficult. Eating what’s good for you just doesn’t feel as good as eating
what’s bad for you, in many cases. It’s not that you can’t ever eat a fast food
meal again — you can. You can’t, however, eat fast food or packaged food all
or even most of the time and stay healthy.
The desire for a quick (and easy) fix
Given a choice, most people will take the quick fix over hard work every time.
Lose 25 pounds in a week, guaranteed? Sign me up! Quit smoking overnight?
Here’s my money! Build a beautiful body in only two minutes a day — and
you don’t even have to stand up? That’s for me!
It’s human nature to want something for nothing, but when it comes to living
longer, you have to put in the time and effort — hours in the gym, self-control
in the grocery store, and discipline in your lifestyle choices. And make no
mistake, it takes time and effort to eat healthier foods, exercise, and maintain
a focused, balanced low-stress lifestyle. You have to give up things — horribly
unhealthy foods that taste so wonderful as well as time you feel short on
anyway — to get yourself in a positive aging routine.
Some of the more recent “quick fix” ideas have involved getting hormone
supplements to stay young. Here’s the real story on some of the most often
touted anti-aging hormones:
 Human growth hormones (HGH): These are produced by your pituitary
gland and are required for growth and cell repair. They start dropping at
around age 40, and by age 70, HGH production may have dropped as
much as 75 percent. So, HGH supplementation sounds like the perfect
way to reverse the effects of aging. But does it work?
18
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

Some studies have shown an increase in muscle mass and decrease in
body fat in patients with a documented deficiency who received injections
several times a week. The studies didn’t, however, demonstrate an increase
in strength along with the increase in muscle mass in those that didn’t
have a deficiency in the hormone. Evidence supports that HGH use in
those who have a deficiency does offer benefits, but doesn’t appear to
be the simple answer for those without deficiency but are looking for a
short cut.
 Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): DHEA is a hormone produced by the
adrenal glands and is converted into the hormones estrogen and testos-
terone. Levels of DHEA drop as you get older, and it’s been theorized
that raising DHEA levels may increase muscle mass and bone density,
boost the immune system, and delay aging symptoms, such as joint
pain, decreased muscle, libido, and lower energy.
However, a study of 144 people over age 60 conducted by the Mayo Clinic
over a two year period showed no increase in muscle strength, bone
mass, endurance, or quality of life. An earlier, smaller, and shorter study
did show some reduction in body fat and insulin resistance in those taking
DHEA. Based on the evidence, use of DHEA without diagnosed deficiency
doesn’t seem to offer much benefit. As with other hormones, DHEA can
help those who have a deficiency.
 Testosterone therapy: Like many hormones, testosterone production
starts to decrease around age 30. Low testosterone levels can cause
impotence in men and decreased sex drive, bone loss, muscle loss, and
low energy levels in both men and women.
• Men: In men with low testosterone, supplementation can increase
all the above, so the interest in testosterone as a way to keep older
men “young” developed. However, using testosterone supplements
if you have normal testosterone levels already can be risky; very
high levels of testosterone have been linked to breast cancer in
men and can cause prostate enlargement, which can accelerate
already present prostate cancer.
• Women: Women with low testosterone can have improvements in
weight management and libido, but they may also develop male
characteristic side effects such as increased facial hair and deepened
voice. These won’t occur if you’re truly deficient and monitored
correctly.
While hormone supplementation can be valuable, it’s only valuable if you
have a hormone deficiency. If you’re having symptoms of fatigue, erectile dys-
function, inability to lose weight, muscle wasting despite exercise, or
decreased libido, supplementation with hormones may help, but you need to
discuss testing with your doctor instead of grabbing a bottle off the health
store shelf. People who don’t have a deficiency and are using it as a short cut
to improve strength, endurance, and energy may have adverse reactions.
Also, athletes have been using this for enhancement without a true deficiency
or understanding of what the long-term consequences are.

Modifying Your Lifestyle: The One
True Source of Hope
Wading through the mire of information, articles, products, and research on
aging is enough to leave you feeling conflicted and confused. Medicine is
starting to center on the behavioral modification that effectively helps people
practice healthy lifestyles. So familiarize yourself with the truth — which we
provide for you in the pages of this book — and resolve to let it guide your
decisions.
In the end, living a healthier lifestyle is nine-tenths attitude change and one-
tenth real effort. If you change your attitude about food, eating healthy will
no longer seem like a punishment. Changing your exercise attitude makes
exercise a pleasure rather than a pain. Getting rest is the energy for tomorrow.
This type of attitude pushes you forward through the rest of this book and
educates you further about the dangers and rewards of better lifestyles 
and healthier aging. And we’re happy to take the first leg of your journey to
healthful living and aging with you.

f you were a fine wine, you could honestly say, “I’m not getting older, I’m
getting better” and mean it. You may not be aging like fine wine, but you
can help yourself age well, especially when it comes to avoiding the four
biggest health risks of aging: cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
osteoporosis. You have the benefit of technology and research providing the
tools to carry you further in life, with fewer health problems than any genera-
tion before you. Your job is to pick up the tools — the information, screening
techniques, and recommendations for healthier living — and use them.
Life is full of choices and every one of them influences health in some form.
Because you can’t look into the future, the best thing to do is to live as if
every lifestyle choice you make has health ramifications down the road. The
key phrase we repeat often throughout this book is modify your lifestyle. We
hope this chapter convinces you that everyday changes can add up to
healthier years — for years to come.
Cancer: The Four Most Common Forms
Few health diagnoses strike as much fear as the words, “You have cancer.”
But today, like at no other time, cancer can be conquered or kept under 
control in many cases. Cancer is one of the top causes of death worldwide,
responsible for 13 percent of all deaths in 2005. If projections are accurate,
this number could reach 9 million by 2015. Cancer cells exist and thrive in
two ways:

 Metastasize: This term means that abnormal cells in a part of the body
grow and can spread rapidly to other areas of the body. Metastasis is the
major cause of cancer death, but in most cases, metastasis occurs later
in the course of the disease . . . hence the importance of early detection.
 In situ: The term in situ means that the cancer cells haven’t spread
beyond the sites where the cancer began; it’s still contained in the ducts
or lobules.
The chance of developing cancer increases with age; 76 percent of all cancer
is diagnosed in people over the age of 50. Although some of the risk factors for
cancer, such as age, ethnicity, and family history, are beyond your control, you
can still prevent 40 percent of cancers by modifying lifestyle choices, eating a
healthy diet, staying physically active, and steering clear of tobacco products.
In this section, we cover the four most commonly diagnosed cancers —
breast, colon, lung, and prostate — as well as their specific risk factors and
preventive measures. We chose these particular cancers to discuss in detail
not only because they’re common cancers, but also because they’re among the
most easily diagnosed through routine examinations, which can increase cure
rates. And in the case of lung and colon cancer, they’re the most preventable
by lifestyle modification and/or early treatment. (Many other cancers, such as
liver and stomach, can’t be diagnosed through routine testing and often aren’t
diagnosed until symptoms develop.)
Lung cancer
About 1.3 billion people worldwide smoke, even though it’s no secret that
smoking can kill you. If you aren’t convinced to quit, what will it take? Check
out the following statistics of lung cancer:
 Is the most common cancer worldwide, with 1.2 million new cases 
diagnosed in 2007 alone
 Is the deadliest cancer and has the highest worldwide mortality rate
 Three million people diagnosed with lung cancer worldwide
 Causes more deaths than the other three most common cancers 
combined (colon, breast, and prostate)
The good news? Most lung cancer is preventable, because 90 percent of
cases are caused by smoking. Imagine how quickly new cases of lung cancer
would drop if everyone quit lighting up.
Differentiating among the different types
Lung cancer falls into two general categories, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC),
also called oat cell cancer, and non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is
22
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

much more common — around 80 percent of lung cancers are NSCLC. SCLC
grows more quickly than NSCLC and is almost entirely caused by smoking.
NSCLC can be divided into three different types:
 Adenocarcinoma: These cancers account for about 40 percent of lung
cancers and have a better prognosis than other types of lung cancer.
Adenocarcinomas are often found in the outer regions of the lungs and
initially develop in the mucus producing cells.
 Large cell carcinoma: Around 10 to 15 percent of lung cancers fall into
this category; large cell carcinoma has characteristically large, rounded
cells, grows rapidly, and has a poor prognosis.
 Squamous cell carcinoma: This cancer accounts for about 25 to 30 
percent of all lung cancers and most commonly occurs near the center
of the lung in one of the bronchus (one of the two main branches of the
windpipe). Smoking is the main cause.
Understanding your risk
Unlike some cancers, doctors know what causes lung cancer. Take a look at
the risk factors:
 Smoking: Cigarette smoking is the number one cause of lung cancer.
Ninety percent of lung cancer cases occur in people who smoke. The
more cigarettes you smoke, the higher your risk of developing lung
cancer. Cigarette smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, many of which
are proven to be cancer-causing substances called carcinogens.
Carcinogens cause irreversible damage to your body’s DNA cells and
increase the chance of cancerous change.
 Radon inhalation: Radon is a gas not detected by sight, taste, or smell.
Radon is the second most common cause of lung cancer. Radon gas
causes between 15,000 and 22,000 lung cancer deaths each year in the
United States. Radon gas comes up through the soil and in through cracks
in your home or a building’s foundation. It tends to build up in unventi-
lated basements, pipes, drains, or walls. Home sales in many places now
require radon testing — call the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
or the National Environmental Health Association for more info.
 Workplace chemicals: People (mine workers, pipe fitters, and ship-
builders) who are exposed to certain workplace materials, such as
asbestos, (see the sidebar “When the culprit is fibers, not nicotine”)
have a higher risk of lung cancer because inhaled fibers and dust can
become embedded in the lung cells, causing a chronic inflammatory
reaction that can eventually result in cancerous cell changes. Workers’
risks are much higher if they smoke in addition to having these types of
chemical exposures.
 Secondhand smoke: The EPA has classified secondhand smoke as a
known cause of cancer in humans. Secondhand smoke is also known as
23
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

environmental tobacco smoke and is classified as any mixture of smoke
given off by the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, pipe, or smoke exhaled
from a smoker’s lungs. Secondhand smoke causes approximately 3,400
lung cancer deaths in the U.S. every year. Some of the carcinogens in sec-
ondhand smoke include formaldehyde, benzene, vinyl chloride, arsenic,
ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide. These agents have an immediate effect
on your cardiovascular system.
 Age: As with many cancers, your risk for developing lung cancer
increases with age. The longer you smoke and the more cigarettes you
smoke, the greater your chances of developing lung cancer. Less than 1
percent of lung cancer cases occur in people under age 40. The develop-
ment of lung cancer increase thereafter, with the average patient age at
diagnosis around 60.
 Family history: People who have a first-degree relative (mother, father,
brother, or sister) with lung cancer have a higher incidence of lung
cancer because some lung cancer is linked to mutations in the genetic
cells that can be passed on to blood relatives.
Playing your part in prevention
If you want to reduce your risk for lung cancer, stop smoking, never start
smoking, stay away from those who do, and avoid exposure to asbestos or
chemicals (like radon and chromium) that can cause lung cancer. Eliminating
these risks of lung cancer and lung disease and getting thorough medical
evaluations for any exposures can almost completely eliminate the risk of
lung cancer.
People with certain exposures may need to have yearly x-rays or other imaging
due to the duration that some cancers take to develop. Some of the cancers
can be missed with x-rays alone while computed tomography (CT) scans can
be more sensitive, so see your doctor to establish the proper testing.
What if you used to smoke, but don’t now? Your risk for developing lung
cancer starts to decline approximately five years after you kick the habit.
After ten years, your risk of lung cancer is about 50 percent lower than a
smoker’s, and the risk continues to decrease with time. It takes nearly 20
years for your lungs to return to “almost” normal, but some damage always
remains. For people who’ve quit smoking and do develop lung cancer, studies
show they usually respond better to treatment and may live longer than
those who continue to smoke.
Recognizing the symptoms
In the early stages of lung cancer, you may not experience symptoms. Many
of the cases of lung cancer are found when doing screening tests or diagnos-
tic tests for something else and then identifying lung cancer. By the time any
symptoms develop, lung cancer is most likely in advanced stages and has
metastasized. For these reasons, the mortality rate for lung cancer is so high.
The following are the most common lung cancer symptoms:
24
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

 Cough that persists or worsens without any particular reason
 Hoarseness
 Fever or night sweats
 Coughing up blood
 Weight loss and loss of appetite
 Shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest tightness
 Chronic infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia
Talk to your doctor if you experience any of these cancer symptoms.
Treating lung cancer and considering the prospects
Lung cancer treatments are based on the type of lung cancer, how advanced
the disease, and your underlying general health. If the cancer is found to be
treatable and your health supports treatment, doctors usually use some 
combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery:
 Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is used to shrink tumors, keep tumors
from spreading, or simply to help relieve pain from some of the tumors
when someone is receiving comfort measures only. Chemotherapy drugs
damage healthy cells as well as cancerous cells and can have severe side
effects that may seem worse than the cancer symptoms themselves.
These types of reactions depend on the type of agents used; some
chemotherapy agents cause fewer symptoms than others. A cancer
doctor can determine the best option for your specific cancer situation.
 Radiation: Radiation uses x-rays to kill cancer cells. This procedure can
be accomplished by shooting the radiation through the outside of the
body or directly inserting radiation into the cancer or area of the cancer
by needles or catheters. The delivery method depends on the type of
cancer, stage, and location of the cancer, with the goal of destroying
25
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)
When the culprit is fibers, not nicotine
Two other types of cancer are mesothelioma,
usually found in asbestos exposed workers, and
carcinoid tumors. Asbestos is a naturally occur-
ring fibrous mineral, which is used in many
industrial building materials because it’s durable
and resistant to heat. Mesothelioma cancer
takes 35 to 40 years to develop and grows in the
lining of the lungs. It produces copious amounts
of fluid, which needs frequent draining from the
lungs. Carcinoid tumors are rare, benign tumors
accounting for only 1 to 2 percent of lung can-
cers. They can be removed, or chemotherapy or
radiation can be used to shrink them.

cancer cells with minimal harm to the surrounding healthy tissue.
Radiation can damage normal tissues, so make sure to discuss radiation
treatment with a doctor specializing in radiation therapy.
 Surgery: Lung cancer treatment may involve removing a portion, a lobe,
or a whole lung. Lymph nodes surrounding the cancerous area may be
removed during surgery to determine whether treatment options are
needed.
Regardless of the treatment, lung cancer can have a poor prognosis if not
found early. The following statistics apply to lung cancer:
 Only one in eight lung cancer patients survives five years after their
diagnosis.
 The five-year survival rate is almost 50 percent for patients with local-
ized tumors; unfortunately, less than 25 percent of cases are diagnosed
that early.
 After the cancer metastasizes, the five-year survival rate is less than 
2 percent.
 Approximately six out of ten lung cancer patients die within one year of
their diagnosis; between seven and eight out of ten people die from their
disease in two years.
Breast cancer
Many young women state that their biggest health fear when growing older 
is breast cancer. Even though lung cancer has a higher mortality rate and
heart disease is a greater health risk (see respective sections in this chapter),
breast cancer is still what many women worry most about. On the flip side,
many women don’t worry about breast cancer because it doesn’t run in their
families. This false sense of security can be a costly mistake if it keeps you
from having preventative testing.
Consider the following breast cancer facts:
 Globally, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among
women and is the second leading cause of cancer death for women.
 About 1.2 million people worldwide are diagnosed with the disease each
year with approximately 502,000 global deaths.
 Breast cancer also affects about 1,600 men worldwide each year.
 Breast cancer is more common among women over the age of 40 and is
rare in women under age 25.
 Fifty percent of diagnosed breast cancer is in women over age 65.
26
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

You can’t completely prevent breast cancer — everyone is at risk. Great
strides have been made in breast cancer awareness in recent years, with
more women aware of the symptoms and utilizing self-exam and diagnostic
techniques regularly.
Differentiating types of breast cancer
Breast cancer is classified in different ways according to its location and
whether it’s metastasized. The following list describes other terms you may
hear used to describe breast cancer:
 Adenocarcinoma: Most breast cancers start in the glandular tissue
(lobes and ducts) of the breast; cancers of glandular tissue are called
adenocarcinoma. There are two types of adenocarcinoma:
• Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): DCIS means the cancer is con-
tained within the walls of the ducts and hasn’t spread to other
breast tissue or metastasized. This is the most common type of
noninvasive breast cancer, accounting for around 20 percent of
newly diagnosed cases. Almost all women diagnosed at this stage
can be cured.
• Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): LCIS begins in the lobules of the
breast but hasn’t invaded through to surrounding breast tissue.
LCIS isn’t a true cancer; it may be the early stage of cancer or may
simply increase a woman’s risk of getting cancer later. Everyone
agrees that at a minimum having LCIS increases your risk and that
it’s important to follow the screening guidelines for breast cancer
closely if you have LCIS.
 Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC): IDC, which starts in a duct and then
breaks through to the fatty part of the breast, accounts for 80 percent 
of all invasive breast cancers. After the cancer breaks through, it can
metastasize through your blood stream or lymphatics.
 Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC): Ten percent of invasive breast can-
cers are ILC, which begins in the lobules (milk producing glands). ILC is
harder to feel on examinations and harder to detect on mammograms
than IDC, but can metastasize in the same way, through lymphatics and
blood vessels.
 Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC): This cancer is an uncommon type of
breast cancer accounting for only 1 to 3 percent of cases. Instead of con-
taining a single lump or tumor, the entire breast becomes warm and red,
with the skin taking on the appearance of an orange peel. This condition
occurs because the cancer cells are blocking the lymph vessels in the
skin. IBC is more likely to spread (metastasize) than ductal or lobular
cancers (see previous bullets).
 Paget disease of the nipple: This cancer is rare and accounts for only 1
percent of all breast cancers. The upside of this cancer is that it has an
excellent prognosis (meaning that there are good cure rates) in most
27
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

cases. The disease starts in the breast ducts and then spreads to the
skin of the nipple and then to the areola, the dark circle around the
nipple. You may feel itching or burning and notice crusted, scaly, and
red areas, which may ooze or bleed.
Understanding your risk
You can control some risks for developing breast cancer. Unfortunately, with
breast cancer, the risks you can’t control outweigh the ones you can. For
these reasons, early detection is important. The following are major risk 
factors for breast cancer:
 Gender: Both men and women can develop breast cancer:
• Women are far more likely to develop breast cancer than men. 
The ratio of women to men with breast cancer is 100 to one. The
National Cancer Institute predicts that one in eight women born
today will develop breast cancer in her lifetime.
• Risk factors for men include age (the average age for breast cancer
in men is about age 67), obesity (obese men have higher levels of
estrogens in their body), testicular and liver disease, and a disease
called Kleinfelter’s syndrome, which occurs in men who are born
with two or more “x” chromosomes. Exposure to high levels of
radiation also increases men’s risk.
 Age: As your age increases, so does your chance for developing breast
cancer. This is due to exposure to estrogen over your lifetime and the
fact that there has been a longer time for cells to have cancerous
changes. According to the National Cancer Institute, for women age 
is a factor as follows:
• Age 30 to 39 — 1 in 233 probability of breast cancer
• Age 40 to 49 — 1 in 69 probability of breast cancer
• Age 50 to 59 — 1 in 38 probability of breast cancer
• Age 60 to 69 — 1 in 27 probability of breast cancer
 Family history of cancer: A woman’s risk of developing breast cancer
increases if she has a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter)
diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer before the age of 40. Other
combinations of family history risk factors are moderate risks, such as
having two close relatives from the same side of the family diagnosed
with breast cancer (one must be mom, sister, or daughter, while the
other can be an aunt, grandma, or even Uncle Bob).
Scientists have found that women with genetic mutations (random 
structural changes) to genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (short for Breast Cancer
1 and Breast Cancer 2) have up to an 85 percent chance of developing
28
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

breast cancer in their lifetime. Less than 10 percent of breast cancer
cases are related to inheritable genes, however. If you do have a strong
family history, your doctor may want you to have earlier or more 
frequent testing done.
 Long-term estrogen exposure: A strong correlation exists between 
breast cancer development and the hormone estrogen. Estrogen stimu-
lates cancer cells to grow and divide rapidly. A woman’s estrogen levels
rise during puberty, then decrease during menopause. The longer a
woman’s breasts are exposed to estrogen, the greater her risk for develop-
ing breast cancer. Therefore, breast cancer risk may be higher in women
who started menstruating before age 12 or in women who went through
menopause after age 55. Research has also implicated hormonal birth
control — whether oral, injected, or implanted — as a risk, especially if
used for more than five years. Hormone replacement therapy after
menopause may be a risk factor as well, but studies are inconclusive.
 Drinking alcohol: Around one in fifty cases of breast cancer may be
attributed to alcohol consumption in the U.S.; in countries where alcohol
consumption is higher the risk may be as much as one in six cases. You
can control this risk by watching your alcohol intake.
 Poor nutrition and being overweight: Evidence suggests that animal 
fat can increase the risk of breast cancer, but being overweight holds a
much stronger correlation to the development of breast cancer and has
an adverse effect on survival in post menopausal women. (See Chapter 7
for tips on nutrition.) You can curb this risk by taking better care of
yourself.
Playing your part in prevention
“Know thy breasts” should be the defining statement for early detection of
breast cancer. Breast cancer prevention starts with regular breast self-exams,
beginning when you’re in your 20s. Using a step-by-step approach on a spe-
cific schedule (see the next section, “Recognizing abnormalities”), women
can be aware of how their breasts normally look and feel.
Monthly self-exams provide you with a baseline; if anything changes from
month to month, you’re the first to know. Report any breast changes to a
health professional as soon as they’re discovered. Remember that a breast
change doesn’t mean you have cancer!
The best time for a woman to examine her breasts is one week after her
period is over, when her breasts aren’t tender or swollen, so she can feel any
abnormalities or lumps that may be present. This examination is no small task
at times; some women have very lumpy breasts and the lumps may change
from month to month. (See the nearby sidebar, “All lumps aren’t created
equal,” for more info.)
29
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should still keep examining their
breasts regularly, even though the breasts may be tender. Women with breast
implants should ask their surgeon to help them differentiate between breast
tissue and the implant. To ensure proper technique, women should review
their self breast exam (SBE) process with their healthcare professional during
their clinical breast exam.
Clinical breast exams should be done at every yearly gynecologic exam. At
age 40, women need to have the first of their recommended annual mammo-
grams as well as yearly breast exams, unless they had an abnormal breast
exam or there’s a strong family history of breast cancer. Mammograms are
currently the best and most reliable screening method, although it may take
as many as six to ten years for breast cancer tumors to be detected by mam-
mography. Your doctor may recommend an earlier screening if you have a
personal or family history with breast cancer.
Sometimes ultrasound is used and is good for distinguishing whether a
detected lump is a cyst (likely to be benign) or a solid mass (which could
indicate a tumor). This technique is good to use in women with breast
implants and dense breasts because a mammogram sometimes has difficul-
ties “seeing” through dense tissue or implants. Ultrasound is also a great
method for guiding physicians to do needle biopsies of suspicious lumps.
In 2007, the American Cancer Society recommended that women at high risk
(such as a previous history of breast cancer or a strong family history) for
breast cancer should have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in addi-
tion to their mammograms (not in lieu of). MRIs are more sensitive, picking up
more spots than a mammogram, and may result in more false positive results.
The two tests together give better data to evaluate a woman for breast cancer.
If your doctor detects any abnormalities, he may schedule a follow-up biopsy
or some other doctor-recommended procedure.
30
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 
All lumps aren’t created equal
There are a lot of fibrous tissue, glands, and
ducts in the breast that can feel like lumps.
Lumpy breasts, more scientifically known as
fibrocystic breast disease (FBD), are experi-
enced by as many as 60 percent of all women.
The cause isn’t completely known, but most feel
that hormones are the front runner. Fortunately,
women with FBD notice a reduction in lumpiness
after menopause due to the decrease in female
hormones. The lumps are benign, sometimes
painful, and may change at different points of
your menstrual cycle. Caffeine is thought to
make FBD worse, but whether there’s a true 
link is controversial. It’s still advisable to stop 
caffeine if you have FBD, but consult your doctor
for the specifics.

Recognizing the symptoms
When feeling for a lump in your breast, keep in mind the following things:
 Cancer cells are an abnormal overgrowth — meaning irregular in shape.
The lump will be hard and have a bumpy texture.
 The lump may not move during your self breast exam, but because it
may be small and covered with healthy tissue, you may have a hard time
telling if it moves or not.
 Although cancerous masses have some particular characteristics, any
lump no matter what it feels like should be checked out by a healthcare
professional.
 Look for dimpling of the skin, retraction of the skin or nipple, thickening
of the skin, or nipple discharge.
The technique recommended for self breast exams has changed. There’s evi-
dence that the woman’s position (lying down), area felt, pattern of coverage of
the breast, and use of different amounts of pressure increase the sensitivity of
the self-exam.
To perform a SBE, use these steps (see Figure 2-1):
1. Standing in front of a mirror, look at your breasts for any changes of
size, shape, contour, dimpling, pulling, redness, or flaking skin
around the nipple or surrounding skin.
2. Lie on your back and place your right arm comfortably behind 
your head.
When you lie on your back, your breast tissue spreads more evenly and
thinly over your chest. This position makes feeling for lumps or abnor-
malities easier.
3. Place the three middle fingers of your left hand on your right breast.
4. Using the pads of your fingers, make small circular motions over your
breast tissue to feel for lumps.
You should circle the tissue three times and use varying levels of pressure
before moving on to the next area.
• Start lightly to feel the skin’s surface.
• Use medium pressure to feel the tissue just under the skin, and then
• Press more firmly to feel the tissue closest to your chest and ribs.
Use enough pressure to feel all the breast tissue, but don’t cause yourself
pain.
5. Manipulate your fingers over the entire breast area in an up and down
pattern starting from under your arm and across your breast to the
middle of the chest bone (sternum) making a large square.
31
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

Use this pattern to help:
• Draw an imaginary square (from just under your arm along your
neck to your collar bone, then down your breast bone and over
your rib cage and back up).
• Using the pads of your fingers, walk them up and down imaginary
rows of the square like a BINGO card, feeling the breast tissue for
any abnormalities or lumps.
This up-and-down pattern is the most effective method for not
missing any tissue.
6. Now repeat the process of Steps 2 to 5 on your left breast, using the
fingers on your right hand.
7. When you’re done examining your breasts from a reclining position,
stand up.
8. Standing in front of the mirror, place your hands on your hips and
look at your breasts for any changes of size, shape, contour, dimpling,
pulling, redness, or flaking skin around the nipple or surrounding
skin.
The act of pressing down on your hips contracts the muscles in your
chest. This makes any changes in your breast more apparent.
9. Place your arms by your side and look; raise your hands above your
head and press your palms to one another and look again.
This completes your monthly exam. Report any lumps or abnormalities
to your doctor.

Following up on a lump
Most of the lumps that you can feel are benign (not cancer); most often the
first sign of breast cancer is abnormalities found on a mammogram when 
it can’t be felt on SBEs or by a medical professional. In fact, the American
Academy of Family Physicians indicates as many as 90 percent of breast
lumps are benign. Have any lumps or changes evaluated by your doctor.
After you find a lump in your breast, here’s what happens during a typical
physician evaluation:
 You give a full health history, including the mention of an immediate
family member with breast cancer (mother, sister, daughter).
 You have a full breast exam, with the doctor palpating your breasts for
any lumps or abnormalities.
 You schedule a mammogram, ultrasound, or breast MRI (one or more of
these may be done).
If the physician workup reveals any suspicious lumps you may be scheduled
for one of the following procedures:
 A needle to remove cells from the lump to test for cancer
 A core biopsy to remove part of the lump for evaluation
 A lumpectomy to have the lump surgically removed and tested
If your lump is breast cancer, the earlier you can begin treatment, the better
your survival rate.
Treating breast cancer and considering the prospects
Treatment options for breast cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, hormone
therapy, and radiation. The five-year survival rate for localized breast cancer is
98 percent. Unfortunately, advanced metastatic cancer has a higher mortality
rate. If the cancer has spread regionally this survival rate drops to 81 percent
and those with distant metastases have a 26 percent five-year survival rate.
After the five-year mark, the overall survival rate drops to 80 percent.
We don’t go into treatment details here, but for more info, check out Breast
Cancer For Dummies (Wiley) by Ronit Elk, PhD, and Monica Morrow, MD.
Prostate cancer
The prostate plays a vital role in the male reproductive system. A healthy
prostate is about the size of a peach pit and the shape of a walnut. It’s located
underneath the bladder, in front of the rectum, and surrounds the urethra,
which carries urine and seminal fluid (not simultaneously). Blood vessels and
nerves also travel through the prostate tissue.
33
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

Prostate cancer is cancer inside this small gland and is quite common. This
cancer is treatable when caught early and is usually found during routine
screening. Despite the excellent cure rate, men are particularly frightened of
prostate cancer because they see it as a huge threat to their manhood. Many
already feel uncomfortable with the screening procedure and are really 
reluctant to have biopsies and possible surgery.
Male hormones (androgens) can cause the prostate to grow, and many men
develop benign enlargement of the prostate as they age. An enlarged prostate
squeezes the urethra, vessels, and nerves and can cause symptoms similar to
the symptoms of prostate cancer. Enlargement is a very common condition,
but don’t assume prostate symptoms are just age-related prostate enlarge-
ment. The symptoms are so similar to prostate cancer that you should see
your doctor to rule out cancer.
Understanding your risk
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, other than skin can-
cers, and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. The good
news, though, is that 90 percent of prostate cancers are diagnosed early, while
still in the prostate (or close by) and carries a five-year survival rate for these
men of nearly 100 percent.
While the exact cause of prostate cancer isn’t known, there are certain identi-
fiable risks:
 Age: Some clinicians feel that every male would develop prostate cancer
if they lived long enough, but most men die of a different cause before
this happens. It’s an interesting thought. Although many men are now
being diagnosed as early as their 40s, the majority, about 65 percent, of
diagnoses are made in men over age 65. Here’s the age breakdown:
• Under age 40: You have a 1 in 10,000 chance
• Ages 40 to 59: You have a 1 in 39 chance
• Ages 60 to 69: You have a 1 in 14 chance
 Ethnicity: African-American men are nearly 60 percent more likely to
develop prostate cancer than Caucasian men. They are also two and a
half times more likely to die from the disease and are ranked with the
highest percentage of prostate cancer cases in the world. Researchers
haven’t been able to explain these racial differences.
 Family history: Men with a single first-degree relative (think father,
brother, or son) diagnosed with prostate cancer have a greater risk of
developing prostate cancer. A man with a family history of two or more
relatives with prostate cancer is four times more likely to develop the
disease himself. The risk is highest in men whose family members were
diagnosed before age 65.
34
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

 Western-Hemisphere lifestyle: A diet high in calories from unhealthy
fat, refined carbohydrates, and animal protein, coupled with low physi-
cal activity contributes to a variety of diseases, including cancer. The
WHO specifically attributes the development of prostate cancer to this
“Western lifestyle.”
Playing your part in prevention
In order to diagnose prostate cancer early, you need to do take an active part
in your healthcare. Just as women should perform monthly self breast exams
and receive mammograms starting at age 40, men need to start having these
annual screening exams at age 40:
 Digital rectal exam (DRE): This rectal exam is administered by a doctor.
The doctor inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to check
the prostate for lumps, nodules, or masses. The prostate should be
smooth, uniform in shape, and symmetrical.
 Prostate-specific antigen (PSA): This test measures the level of PSA in
the blood. PSA is an enzyme produced mostly by the prostate to liquefy
semen and normally enters the bloodstream in small amounts.
When the two tests are done in conjunction with each other cancer detection
is improved. Doing these tests singularly may increase the chances of a
missed diagnosis in a cancer that already doesn’t produce many symptoms.
Recognizing the symptoms
The symptoms of prostate cancer are easily misinterpreted as other problems,
so here are some of the most common signs and symptoms of prostate cancer:
 Rectal pressure or pain in the space between the anus and the scrotum
 Frequent or painful urination
 Frequent urination at night (nocturia)
 Difficulty getting the urine stream started
 Blood in the urine or ejaculate
 Painful ejaculation
 Loss of appetite and weight
 Bone pain caused from local cancer spread into the bones
Treating prostate cancer and considering the prospects
Your prostate cancer treatment options may involve surgery, radiation therapy,
or hormone therapy. Discuss your best course of action with your doctor. Your
doctor monitors your health closely for any changes in your symptoms, if you
develop new symptoms, or if any worsen.
35
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

The survival stats for men with the cancer without having metastasized to
other organs or tissues are as follows:
 99 percent survive at least 5 years
 92 percent survive at least 10 years
 61 percent survive at least 15 years
Colorectal cancer
Colorectal cancer is located in the colon or in the rectum but is more com-
monly referred to as simply colon cancer. The colon is the first 4 to 5 feet of
the large intestine while the rectum, the connector between the colon and the
anus, is the last 5 to 6 inches. The areas are both extensions of each other and
cancers in these areas are handled similarly. Colorectal cancer is the third
most-common type of cancer in the world with 940,000 new cases diagnosed
annually. In the U.S., colon cancer has the second highest mortality rate of all
cancers, but many deaths can be prevented with proper screening and risk
reduction.
Understanding your risk
There’s no single known risk factor for developing colon cancer, but rather a
group of risk factors:
 Polyps: Polyps are small, fleshy bumps or nodules attached to the wall
of the colon or rectum, and they’re the biggest risk factor of colorectal
cancer. Almost all cases of colorectal cancer develop from polyps. These
bumps that aren’t removed may grow abnormally and eventually becom-
ing malignant.
The process of going from a benign polyp to a malignant tumor can 
take several years. Many colon polyps are benign, but all polyps have 
the potential to become cancerous, some more aggressively than others.
When cancer grows within a polyp, in time it can infiltrate the wall of the
colon, spreading into blood vessels or lymph nodes. After metastasis has
occurred the cure rate drops significantly, which is why detection and
removal of polyps before they become cancerous are important.
 Age: Over 90 percent of cases are diagnosed in people over the age of 50
with the average age at diagnosis around 70. Your chance of being diag-
nosed with colorectal cancer is 50 times higher if you’re age 60 to 79 than
if you’re younger than age 40.
 Family history: Colorectal cancer is more likely to occur among people
with a first-degree relative (mother, father, sister, son) diagnosed with col-
orectal cancer, especially if the cancer was diagnosed at a young age.
Between 2 and 5 percent of people with colorectal cancer inherit abnor-
mal genes: One is called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and the
36
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

other hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). If you have one
or more relatives diagnosed with colorectal cancer before the age of 50,
consider having a blood test to determine if you have the gene mutation
and then take the appropriate preventative measures.
 Chronic inflammatory bowel disease: People who suffer from Crohn’s dis-
ease (inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract) or ulcerative
colitis (inflammatory bowel disease) for at least eight to ten years have a
higher risk of colorectal cancer. Constant inflammation of the colon can
cause cell turnover and can also speed up the growth of polyps. Your
doctor may suggest doing more frequent colonoscopies.
Playing your part in prevention
The incidence of colon cancer has gone down in the last 15 years due to 
the fact that, in many cases, colorectal cancer can be prevented by removing
precancerous polyps. Early detection with regular exams after age 50 is the
biggest factor in early detection and treatment of colorectal disease, but less
than 50 percent of eligible people have been screened for colorectal cancer.
There are a few types of screenings you can have done to test for colorectal
cancer:
 Digital rectal examination (DRE): This exam begins at age 40 (some
doctors start at age 50) and continues annually. During a rectal exam,
your doctor may be able to detect polyps in the rectum. If older than 50,
at no time does this test replace the need for a colonoscopy.
 Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): This screening starts at age 50 and con-
tinues annually. FOBT tests for hidden blood in three consecutive stool
samples. As a doctor, Brent likes to have people start at age 40 because
the test is simple, non-invasive, and helpful. This test is also helpful for
people that are suspicious of blood in the stool but aren’t sure.
 Double-contrast barium enema: This test consists of a series of X-rays of
the colon and rectum after being given an enema containing barium dye
and an injection of air into the bowel. This test isn’t done as frequently 
as colonoscopy because the barium enema isn’t as effective as the
colonoscopy at detecting polyps smaller than a half an inch. But the
barium enema is still an acceptable, low-cost alternative when a
colonoscopy can’t be performed.
 Colonoscopy: A colonoscopy is an internal examination of the colon using
a flexible lighted instrument called a colonoscope. The whole purpose of
the colonoscopy is to find polyps, remove them, and then follow proper
monitoring after removal. Colonoscopies can be used as screening tests
or as follow-up diagnostic tools when the results of another screening test
are positive. Colonoscopy screenings start at age 50 and if anything is
found then the frequency is increased. If nothing’s found, doctors may
wait up to ten years for your next scope (depending on the doctor).
37
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

Recognizing the symptoms
Early colorectal cancer may not cause many symptoms. The most common
symptoms are associated with changes in bowel habits, which includes one
or more of the following:
 Rectal bleeding: This bleeding occurs with visible blood in the stools,
on toilet paper, or in the water.
 Microscopic blood: This blood isn’t visible to the naked eye. This is why
fecal occult blood testing is important (see preceding section).
 A change in usual bowel patterns: Having constipation or diarrhea for
more than 7 to 10 days can indicate a problem.
 Nausea or vomiting: These symptoms are common complaints from
people with certain cancers of the gastrointestinal tract due to the 
location of the cancer. Some other cancers can also effect appetite and
indirectly induce some nausea.
 Lower abdominal pain: Pain from either gas, cramping, or bloating that
lasts longer than a week or feeling that your stomach is distended or full
should be discussed with your doctor.
 Shape of the stool: Thinning of your stool into “thin pencil shapes”
could indicate an obstruction in the intestine that is pressing on the
stool creating the thinner form.
 Unexplained weight loss: Cancer can use up much of the body’s energy
and sometimes can release substances that can alter metabolism.
Furthermore, people with cancer often develop loss of appetite that
develops so slowly that it’s not recognized as a problem.
38
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 
Having a colonoscopy . . . it’s not so bad!
Most people feel that the prep to clean out the
colon (which is necessary) is worse than the
colonoscopy itself. To clean the colon properly, you
need to use laxatives and /or enemas, as well as
not eat solid foods for 24 to 48 hours prior to the test.
Note: Because there’s a risk of bleeding with this
procedure, people taking blood thinner medication
or supplements should consult with their doctor
prior to examination.
A colonoscopy procedure can be performed with
or without a sedative and pain reliever for comfort,
although most people elect to have medication. To
begin, you lie on your left side with your knees
drawn up toward your chest. The colonoscope is
then inserted through the rectum and gently
advanced to the lowest part of the small bowel. Air
and water pass through the scope to remove any-
thing obstructing the doctor’s view, and suction is
used to remove debris as needed. If the doctor
finds any abnormalities, tissue samples are taken
with instruments that can be inserted through the
scope.

Never ignore rectal bleeding, because early detection of colon cancer can
save your life. Get a second opinion if a doctor doesn’t appear to be taking
your case seriously. When treating patients with blood in the stool, Dr. Agin
always remembers the tragic situation of a nurse’s 30-year-old husband. Over
a five-year period, the husband was evaluated by several doctors who told
him the bleeding was most likely from hemorrhoids, although no one sent
him for a colonoscopy. By the time he found a doctor who sent him for a
colonoscopy, he had advanced colon cancer and died from it within four
years. If your doctor isn’t taking continuing rectal bleeding seriously, get
another opinion!
Treating colorectal cancer and considering the prospects
Surgery is the most common form of treatment for colorectal cancer. Surgical
removal of a portion of the bowel can increase a person’s survival rate by 75
percent. Some small, malignant polyps can be removed with the colonoscope,
but many patients with colorectal cancer need to undergo bowel resection —
the removal of the portion of bowel that contains the cancerous cells. In most
cases each side of the colon can be reattached after the cancerous section is
removed, but sometimes the patients have to have a colostomy (the bowel is
attached to an opening in the abdominal wall, a stoma, for excretion or waste).
Most of the time this solution is temporary to allow the bowel to heal and 
then the bowel is corrected. A secondary bowel resection may be necessary 
in approximately 25 percent of those patients who have a recurrence. Twenty
percent of those people remain colorectal cancer free.
Colon cancer has decent cure rates, depending on the stage:
 The 5 year survival is greater than 90 percent for localized stage.
 The 5 year survival rate is 65 percent for regional stage.
 The 5 year survival rate is less than 10 percent for distant stage.
Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic illness that if not diagnosed or treated properly can have
a number of complications. People with diabetes have problems managing 
the amounts of glucose (sugar) in the blood. When glucose levels build up in
your blood instead of being delivered to your cells as fuel, your cells become
starved for energy. Over a long period of time, high blood sugar levels lead 
to kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, and arteriosclerosis.
Other complications that come from diabetes and poor blood sugar control
include blindness and severe infections. Diabetics also have a higher risk 
certain cancers, like pancreatic and uterine cancer. Unfortunately, diabetes
isn’t curable — it is, however, manageable.
39
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

Diabetes is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide, with approximately
171 million people having diabetes. This number is expected to increase by
150 percent in the next 20 years due to the increase in obesity, poor nutrition,
and sedentary lifestyle.
For the complete rundown on diabetes, read Diabetes For Dummies, 2nd
Edition (Wiley) by Alan L. Rubin, MD.
Differentiating among 
the types of diabetes
Diabetes can show up in different forms:
 Type 1 diabetes: Type 1 diabetes, the unpreventable form, is typically
diagnosed in childhood or young adulthood and is formerly known as
juvenile diabetes. In people with type 1 diabetes, the insulin producing
cells in the pancreas (beta cells) stop functioning. Type 1 diabetes
requires insulin administration for survival and can’t be controlled with
diet and exercise. Possible causes of type 1 include autoimmune disease,
genetic disease, and environmental agents.
 Type 2 diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is the most common form accounting
for 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes
make some insulin, but either it’s not enough or their cells become resis-
tant to insulin. Many people with type 2 diabetes can control their blood
sugar with diet, exercise, and oral medication, but some people still
require insulin injections.
On average, people with type 2 diabetes die 5 to 10 years before people
without diabetes, mostly due to cardiovascular disease. However, and
this is a big however, many of these cases are preventable.
 Gestational diabetes: This form is a type of glucose intolerance that
occurs in approximately 3 to 5 percent of pregnant women, and should be
tested for during the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy. There’s an increase
risk for pregnant women if they have a strong family history of diabetes or
are obese. Women who have gestational diabetes are then at an increased
risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life (up to 20 years).
Understanding your risk
You can’t prevent type 1 diabetes, and gestational diabetes has limited pre-
ventable causes, but you can control the risk factors for type 2 diabetes:
40
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

 Obesity: This is the single greatest risk factor for developing type 2 dia-
betes, because being overweight can inhibit the body from making or
using insulin efficiently. People with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or
higher have an 80 to 90 percent greater incidence of developing type 2
diabetes than people who maintain a healthy weight.
 Age: Most people who develop diabetes are over age 40 with the risk
increasing as a person ages; however, the obesity epidemic in children is
resulting in more type 2 diabetes being diagnosed in children.
 Family history of diabetes: If you have a first-degree relative with type 2
diabetes, you’re at a higher risk.
 Gestational diabetes: If you had gestational diabetes, your risk for
developing type 2 diabetes increases. According to the National
Diabetes Education Program (NDEP) between 5 to 10 percent of women
with gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes.
 Physical inactivity: You can prevent up to 80 percent of type 2 diabetes
cases by adopting a healthy diet and increasing physical activity.
Check with your doctor about a healthy diet and exercise plan to decrease
your sugar levels and get back on track to a healthy weight.
Playing your part in prevention
By taking an active role in modifying your lifestyle choices, you can signifi-
cantly reduce your risk for developing diabetes. Check out the following
changes:
 Maintain a healthy weight: People who lose an average of 10 pounds of
weight through diet and exercise can reduce their risk of developing dia-
betes by nearly 60 percent. The healthy combination of weight manage-
ment and exercise not only reduces the risk of diabetes, but for those
already diagnosed with diabetes, this combo also can reduce symptoms
and improve management of your blood glucose levels. (See Chapter 9
for specific guidelines.)
 Get regular exercise: It’s no secret that regular physical activity is good
for you. By exercising for 30 minutes five or more days a week, you sig-
nificantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. (Chapters 10
and 11 can get you going.)
 Eat a healthy diet: Because diabetes is an illness affecting blood glucose
levels, you can help control and moderate those levels with the foods
you eat and how often you eat them. (Check out Chapters 7 and 8.)
41
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

 Have your fasting blood sugar tested: The American Diabetes
Association recommends that if you’re age 40 or older, have your health-
care provider check your fasting blood sugar once every three years.
Testing for diabetes is done by a simple blood test or urinalysis.
If you experience any of the symptoms listed in the preceding section
and you’re under age 40, notify your doctor immediately to schedule a
blood sugar test — these symptoms can be serious no matter your age.
Recognizing the symptoms
Over 6 million Americans have diabetes and don’t know it. Diabetes can be
effectively managed, but it has to be diagnosed first. Many people with dia-
betes don’t have recognizable symptoms, while others have symptoms but
don’t know they’re indicative of diabetes. Some of the most major symptoms
associated with diabetes are:
 Excessive thirst: When glucose builds up in your bloodstream, fluid gets
pulled from your tissues and may make you feel thirsty. As you drink
fluids to quench your thirst, you also urinate more frequently.
 Extreme hunger: If insulin is unable to move the glucose from your
blood into your cells, you feel hungry, even if you just ate.
 Unexplained weight loss: Even if you eat more because you’re hungry,
you may keep losing weight because the energy from glucose isn’t getting
to your muscle tissues and fat stores, so they diminish.
 Tiredness and fatigue: Without energy from food in your cells, you get
tired, weak, and irritable.
 Blurred vision: When blood sugar levels are too high, your body takes
fluid from body tissue, including your eyes. This makes it hard to focus.
If you experience one or more of these symptoms and think you may have
diabetes, check with your doctor for an accurate diagnosis.
Managing diabetes and considering 
the prospects
If you have diabetes, it’s imperative that you keep your blood sugar under con-
trol. Whether you take insulin, oral medications, or control your diet, the key 
to minimizing complications from diabetes is to keep your blood sugars within
the parameters your doctor sets for you. Taking insulin or oral medication
doesn’t mean you can eat whatever you want.
42
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

Here are a few pointers to keep in mind:
 Watch what you eat, eliminating refined sugars and empty calories as
much as possible.
 Choose the right types of carbohydrates to stabilize blood sugar.
 Use the glycemic index (rates carbohydrates by the affect on blood glu-
cose levels) to better understand what foods or food combinations you
can eat to keep your blood sugar levels steady. (See Chapter 7 for more
about the glycemic index.)
 Another key factor in management of the insulin and blood sugars is to
incorporate a weight management and exercise program.
If you’re diabetic, you need to check your blood sugar several times a day.
Your doctor can give you a prescription for a glucometer, lancets, and a log
book to keep track of your blood sugars. A nurse can show you how to use
your glucometer and record the readings and have you give a demonstration
to make sure you’re doing it correctly. Your doctor has you check your blood
sugar a certain number of times per day based on your blood sugar readings
and other health concerns.
Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the world and 
is responsible for one third of all deaths. The deadly combination of heart dis-
ease and stroke kills 17 million people every year, particularly those in poor
countries. This death rate is projected to climb to a staggering 24 million 
by 2030. The increase is based on increasing trends in obesity, poor diets,
smoking, and physical inactivity, particularly in the younger population.
Cardiovascular disease is not a normal part of healthy aging. The lifestyle
choices you make directly impact the health of your heart and vascular
system and whether you develop CVD.
Understanding the components of the cardiovascular system is a good start
to understanding the problems that occur when abnormalities arise in differ-
ent areas. The cardiovascular system consists of the pump (heart), hoses
(vessels), fluid (blood), and the nozzle (valves); if any one of them isn’t work-
ing properly you can have problems. (See Figure 2-2 for a working diagram.)

Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

Differentiating among the various 
heart diseases and illnesses
Cardiovascular disease is a broad term to describe a mix of many diseases
and illnesses that affect heart health. It’s not only possible but common to
have more than one of these illnesses simultaneously, which further
increases your chance of dying from heart disease. We explain the major
forms of heart disease in the following sections.
There’s really no cure for heart disease, but prevention and screening are 
the best tools for delaying the onset or minimizing the damaging effects.
Coronary artery disease (CAD)
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is also known as coronary heart disease or
ischemic heart disease, and it kills more than 7 million people in the world
each year. CAD results from atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries). In 
atherosclerosis, plaque deposits build up in the arteries. Plaque is made up 
of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances from the blood.
According to the American Heart Association, CAD’s damage is caused by ele-
vated levels of blood cholesterol and triglycerides, high blood pressure, and
tobacco smoke.

High blood pressure
High blood pressure is the result of your heart working harder than normal to
pump blood out into the arteries. The blood pressure is at the highest when
it pumps blood out (systolic pressure) and the lowest in between pumps
(diastolic pressure). The higher a person’s blood pressure measures, the
greater that person’s risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, kidney disease,
and eye damage (retinopathy).
For more info on high blood pressure specifically, check out High Blood
Pressure For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley) by Alan L. Rubin, MD.
Stroke
A person suffers a stroke when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or 
if a blood vessel breaks and you bleed into the brain, causing brain cells to
die. Over 15 percent of people who have a stroke die within 30 days. Of the
people who survive a stroke, 15 to 30 percent suffer from some type of per-
manent disability. The major risk factors for stroke are high blood pressure
and tobacco use. There are three main types of strokes:
 Ischemic stroke: This stroke is the most common type accounting for
over 80 percent of all strokes. During an ischemic stroke a clot forms,
usually caused by atherosclerosis, which blocks a blood vessel that’s
supplying blood to various areas of the brain.
 Hemorrhagic stroke: This type of stroke results from a blood vessel that
breaks and bleeds into the brain. It’s usually much more damaging and
has a higher mortality rate than ischemic stroke (see preceding bullet).
The cause of this stroke is either high blood pressure or an aneurysm (a
weak spot on the artery wall that balloons with blood and may eventually
burst from pressure).
 Transient ischemic attack (TIA): This type of stroke is often referred to
as a mini stroke because it only causes a short interruption of blood flow
to the brain. The symptoms of a TIA last less than 24 hours and are con-
sidered warning signs, because about one-third of people who have a
TIA will suffer from a stroke in the future.
For more info on strokes, pick up a copy of Stroke For Dummies (Wiley) by
John R. Marler, MD.
Understanding your risk
Cardiovascular disease is a major problem and is related to many choices
you make every day. Some factors are even out of your control (such as being
male). Here are some of the most common risk factors:
45
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

 Smoking: Smoking has been linked to plaque build up and high blood
pressure. Smoking also causes your blood to be thicker, which increases
the risk of a stroke. Even if you have smoked for years, stroke is one con-
dition that can still be reduced if you quit.
 Poor diet: Reducing the intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and choles-
terol decreases plaque build up and risks of ischemic strokes (see the
preceding section). A diet high in vegetables and fruit can reduce your
risks, too (see Chapter 7 for more info on nutrition).
 Inactive lifestyle: Physical activity is decreasing in all age groups. This
lack of movement increases risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, ele-
vated cholesterol, and therefore strokes.
 Obesity: Being overweight is associated with elevated cholesterol levels,
high blood pressure, and an increased risk of coronary artery disease.
Excess fat increases the heart’s work which over time can lead to heart
disease.
 Gender and age: Men have a higher risk of heart attack than women.
Even though the difference narrows after women reach menopause, men
still have a higher risk. Most of heart disease related deaths occur after
the age of 65, although the disease likely was present at an earlier age.
 Heredity: Heart disease does tend to run in families. Children of parents
with heart disease are more likely to develop it also. Certain ethnic
groups, such as African Americans and Hispanics, tend to have a higher
prevalence of cardiovascular disease.
Risk factors starting at younger ages are setting the stage for a surge in car-
diovascular disease. Childhood obesity and smoking rates are rising and so
are the rates of diabetes and high cholesterol. These two diseases were once
thought of as diseases of middle-age, but are now being diagnosed in younger
populations. Even some autopsies have found plaque in the aorta and coro-
nary arteries of children that have died in accidents.
Playing your part in prevention, and 
managing cardiovascular disease
Cardiovascular disease isn’t an inevitable part of aging; there are things you
can do to greatly reduce your risk of becoming a heart attack or stroke statis-
tic. If you already have CVD, take immediate steps to reduce the chances of
your disease worsening. The key to preventing as well as managing your CVD
is modifying your lifestyle choices. Here’s how:
 Avoid using tobacco products.
 Maintain healthy cholesterol levels, and have your physician check your
cholesterol levels at each routine checkup visit.
46
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

 Reduce your blood pressure (BP). Stop in to your doctor for a quick BP
check, or take advantage of the free machines at your local pharmacy or
grocery store.
 Eat a healthy diet (see Chapter 7).
 Maintain a health weight (refer to Chapter 9).
 Control your diabetes. If you have diabetes, make sure that you keep
your blood glucose under excellent control. Poorly controlled diabetes
is a major risk factor for heart disease.
 Increase your physical activity. You should be getting a minimum of 150
minutes of aerobic exercise a week.
 Figure out how to manage stress (check out Chapter 13). There are many
ways to reduce stress, and some of them involve activities that are also
helping reduce risks, such as exercise!
Recognizing the symptoms 
of coronary artery disease
You may look right past the first warning signs of coronary artery disease
(CAD), and for many people, there are no warning signs at all. Their first sign
that something’s wrong is a heart attack. That’s scary! Although not all cases
of CAD are preventable — heredity plays a part in who gets it — you can
modify or eliminate many risk factors by visiting your doctor regularly and
being aware of potential early warning signs. The main symptoms of CAD are
as follows:
 Angina (chest pain): Angina refers to chest pain and/or discomfort, with
or without pain in one or both arms or in the left shoulder, neck, jaw, or
back.
 Shortness of breath: This may occur when the coronary arteries
become narrower due to the buildup of plaque (atherosclerosis).
 Irregular heart beats or palpitations: If your heart starts to skip beats
or you feel it beating irregularly.
If a full evaluation by your doctor shows that you have CAD, your doctor 
may be able to control the disease with medications while monitoring for any
changes in symptoms. In some instances you may need invasive tests and
procedures to open up blocked arteries prior to medication therapy.
The tricky situation with CAD is deciding when to call your doctor versus
calling 911 when you experience symptoms of CAD. Each case is different,
and your doctor, who knows your case best, can discuss how you should
approach the onset of chest pain or other symptoms. If you’ve established
CAD but haven’t discussed a plan with your doctor, any new, changing, or
47
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

worsening symptoms are reasons to call 911. If you have the onset of CAD
symptoms and have never experienced any in the past, you also need to treat
those symptoms as a possible heart attack and call 911.
Not all heart attacks look like they do on TV or in the movies. You may have
multiple symptoms at the same time that increase in intensity, or just one
symptom that doesn’t seem very intense. Here are some symptoms:
 A feeling of overwhelming exhaustion; unable to do anything
 A feeling of anxiety along with shortness of breath that doesn’t let up
 Feeling winded when exerting very little effort, which subsides when
you stop
 Experiencing terrible heartburn, possibly with nausea and vomiting or
feeling like you have the flu
 Feeling of pressure, pain, or discomfort, through the chest or back
 A feeling of discomfort, numbness, tingling and/or pain in jaw, upper
back, shoulders, neck, arms (usually on the left side of your body)
 Getting the “cold sweats” and pale skin
Right after calling 911 if you think you’re experiencing a heart attack, go to your
medicine cabinet for a lifesaver everyone should have on hand — plain aspirin
(if you’re not allergic to it!). Chew a 325 milligram tablet of plain aspirin; aspirin
helps reduce platelet formation around the ruptured plaque. Platelets can form
a larger clot, which further decreases blood flow. Chewing aspirin speeds its
absorption — you’ll get over the taste later.
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a progressive disease in which the bones become weak and
lead to an increase risk of fractures. Any bone can be affected by osteoporosis,
but the most common bones that break are in the hip, back, and wrist. Often
people don’t know that they have osteoporosis until a bone actually breaks
and further evaluation reveals poor bone density. Osteoporosis affects more
than 75 million men and women worldwide. To discover more about your
bones and osteoporosis, refer to Chapter 6.
Understanding your risk
Osteoporosis is a risk factor for women, mainly. Women have an increased
risk of osteoporosis because of their hormonal influences. There are several
other risk factors:
48
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

 Age: In both men and women, the risk of osteoporosis increases with
age, with bone loss usually starting around age 30. Women can experi-
ence up to a 20 percent loss of bone mass in the 5 to 7 years following
menopause (average age is 51), due to estrogen loss. Women usually
show signs of osteoporosis around age 65. Men’s bone loss tends to
occur gradually and they don’t usually show signs until age 75.
 Gender: Women are four times more likely to have osteoporosis than
men. Women’s bones are thinner and less dense than men’s, and in addi-
tion, men tend to have more muscle, which serves to protect the bone.
 Smoking: The role of smoking and osteoporosis isn’t clearly understood,
but smoking is thought to decrease the amount of calcium absorbed
from food as well as reduce the production of bone cells (osteoblasts).
 Nutrition: People with a very low calcium intake have a higher risk of
developing osteoporosis because calcium plays such a vital role in bone
development.
 Physical activity: Bone remodeling (new bone formation) occurs in
response to activity. Weight bearing exercises are the best form of activity
to improve lean muscle mass and strengthen your bones (see Chapter 10
for strength-training tips).
Playing your part in prevention
Many cases of osteoporosis are preventable, and the earlier you start making
healthy lifestyle choices the better. The best way to prevent breaking a 
bone due to osteoporosis is to stop osteoporosis before it starts! Take the 
following steps to reduce your risk:
 Get regular weight-bearing exercise. Getting started at an early age helps
prevent osteoporosis or at minimum slow the progression. By strengthen-
ing your muscles, you’re also strengthening your bones. When you lift
weights, the stress on the bone causes the body to increase the calcium
into your bones for added strength. (See Chapter 10 for ideas.)
 Make sure you get enough calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K. All these
vitamins and minerals make your bones strong. A diet rich in calcium is
essential for bone strength. Because you need vitamin D to absorb cal-
cium, it also plays a vital role in maintaining bone density (see Chapter 8
for info on vitamins and minerals).
 Talk to your doctor about available treatments if you’re at high risk of
osteoporosis or already experiencing bone loss. Medications are avail-
able to slow the rate of bone loss and even help rebuild bone. Talk to
your doctor to see what type of treatment option is best for you.
49
Chapter 2: The Five Biggest Concerns about Aging (And How to Prevent Them)

Recognizing the symptoms
Osteoporosis has been called the silent thief because it can take decades to
slowly increase the size of the holes in your bones, weakening them enough
to break. Unfortunately, the first sign that a person has osteoporosis is often
when a fracture occurs. Other symptoms may be severe back pain, loss of
height, or spinal deformities such as kyphosis (hump back) that occur as a
result of collapsed vertebrae.
Managing osteoporosis
Osteoporosis doesn’t have a cure, but current treatments and newer treat-
ments exist that can slow the rate of bone loss and increase bone density.
Hormone therapy used to be the main treatment, but after a large study
showed that the benefits of hormones on the bones didn’t outweigh the 
cardiovascular risks, doctors started using alternative therapies.
Medications such as bisphosphonates are helpful in certain cases. These
therapies can help people keep living their daily lives without the constant
fear and worry that every little bump, twist, or turn will result in a fracture.
The quality of life for people with osteoporosis is improving. Other strategies
such as fall-prevention techniques should be incorporated into a fracture-
prevention program. See Chapter 6 for more on medications and Chapter 19
for fall-prevention tips.

Evaluating Your Health and History
and Setting Goals for Wellness
In This Chapter
 Getting the facts on your medical history
 Keeping those appointments and test dates
 Setting personal goals for a healthier you
 Tracking your goals
 Keeping success in your action plan
P
eople used to go to the doctor only when they were sick or had broken 
a bone. And plenty of people still cower or scoff at the idea of visiting
the doctor when they’re ill, let alone getting a checkup if they’re feeling just
dandy — you know, the if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! rule.
Well, we don’t happen to prescribe to that philosophy as a recipe for longevity
or even good health. Today more than ever before, you have the power of
healthy living and early detection to help prevent debilitating — and possibly
fatal — illnesses and diseases.
In this chapter, we discuss the general measures you can implement to pre-
vent the most threatening illnesses and diseases today (and throughout the
rest of the book, we discuss the specifics of keeping yourself healthy as you
get older). Because your body doesn’t come with an owner’s manual to tell
you when it’s time for a tuneup, we tell you what to look for, what age to 
start looking, and what tests or screenings to schedule with your healthcare
provider. We also give you some gender-specific disease-related information.
Then we help you put your goals down on paper and devise a plan that will
keep you from giving up when the going gets tough. Last but not least, we
look at ways to have fun while you’re getting healthy.

Investigating and Writing Down Your
Medical and Family History
Staying healthy as you age actually consists of two parts: knowing what your
general health risks are now, and knowing what inherited tendencies can lead
to disease in the future. Although your healthcare provider can give you the
most accurate depiction of your overall health (more on that topic in the next
section), this section helps you take the first steps in assessing your present
health so that you can provide the information your doctor needs. That info
plus an understanding of potential inherited health problems puts you in a
much better position to create personal health goals and to devise a plan
(with your doctor, if appropriate) for reaching them.
Taking stock of yourself
Standing back and taking an objective look at yourself from a healthy living
perspective isn’t always easy. Self-evaluation is, however, one of the first, 
easiest, and most effective steps you can take toward eliminating behaviors
that may keep you from living your best as you age.
Although seeing your doctor is important, she can go by only what you tell her
when it comes to diet, exercise, and other important health factors in your life.
You may be a perfect size six, but if you stay that way by eating two candy bars
a day (and nothing else), by skipping dinner in lieu of three glasses of wine a
night, or by smoking instead of eating, your health is going to suffer. You may
look okay on the outside (at least for a while), but the one person you really
can’t fool when it comes to your lifestyle is yourself.
In the appendix, we provide a comprehensive self-assessment to help you
identify strengths and weaknesses in your lifestyle and to pinpoint any health
risks. (We put it at the end of the book so that you can easily make a copy of
it — or tear it out, if you like — fill it out, and take it to your next doctor’s
appointment, especially if you’re planning to improve the quality of your
health and well-being.)
Is it really necessary to let your doctor know that you’ve decided to give up
ice cream bars and start walking two miles a day? Possibly not, if you’re per-
fectly healthy with no family risk factors at all. But if there’s anything at all
concerning in your history or in your physical exam that would preclude
major changes in lifestyle, you may save yourself a lot of health complica-
tions by discussing your plan with your doctor first. Besides, she may have
suggestions to help make your transition into a healthier you an easier one.
52
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

The depth of information you need to gather varies from doctor to doctor;
however, many of the basics (allergies to medications, current medical condi-
tions, and so on) are fairly standard, and we include assessment questions
for all that info in the appendix.
Looking down the family line
Do you have a family? Yes, you do, even if you don’t always like to claim them.
With your family comes a family health history. Although having a sibling with
cancer or a grandparent who died of heart disease doesn’t mean that you’re
going to suffer the same fate, many disease tendencies can be inherited, and
knowing your family history can give you a blueprint of potential health 
landmines in your genetic makeup.
Your doctor needs to know about any family history of illness, such as cardio-
vascular disease, cancer, and so on, because it can change prevention, testing,
and treatments due to certain familial links. In addition to the self-assessment
in the appendix, plan to research your family history and bring pertinent info
to your doctor’s appointment.
When compiling a family health history, start with your immediate family —
brothers, sisters, mom, and dad. You can start by asking questions of your
parents, such as:
 How long did your parents live and what did they die of? You may not
get a straight answer on the cause of your grandparents’ deaths, because
often cause of death wasn’t accurately recorded a generation or so ago.
Even deaths recorded as accidents may not be accurate; a “car accident”
may have been caused by a sudden heart attack.
 Did they have any health problems? Try to get specifics; “bad blood”
could be anything from anemia to syphilis! Some of the more common
conditions with genetic links are heart disease, cancer, addiction, and
diabetes.
 What do you remember about them? They may remember that grandma
was blind and had only one leg without making the connection that these
conditions may have been caused by diabetes.
 Do you have any pictures of relatives? One look at a series of pictures
of great grandma and grandma at different ages can make it evident that
osteoporosis runs in the family — they kept getting shorter!
 Did any diseases or defects “run in the family”? Expect some waffling
on the answer if mental conditions or birth defects were common in the
family. Explain your need to know as a desire to understand your family
medical history rather than pure nosiness.
53
Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Health and History and Setting Goals for Wellness

 What about your brothers and sisters and their families? Make sure
that you’re recording health issues only from blood relatives, not their
spouses or their in-laws.
After picking mom and dad’s brain, talking to your aunts and uncles may
yield new information or a different slant on things. Always start with your
most talkative/nosy family members first, but remember that they may also
be the most likely to embellish the family history! To dig a little deeper, par-
ticularly if your immediate ancestors have passed on or don’t have the info
you need, try to access death certificates, obituaries, and family medical
records from extended family members or library newspaper files. If anyone
in your family is a pack rat or a genealogy buff, he may have already done
much of the legwork for you, and would probably be flattered if you asked 
for a copy of his research.
After you gather enough data to make up a cohesive family history, write it all
down. You can get fancy, drawing an elaborate tree with actual branches, or
you can write it down in simple linear fashion. The U.S. Surgeon General con-
siders your family history recording important enough to have devised a per-
sonalized form that you can use to record pertinent info; you can find it at
www.familyhistory.hhs.gov. Some other helpful Web sites to consider
are www.birthrecords.ws and NGSgenealogy.com.
If you’re adopted, you may not be able to delve into your family history 
to any great degree. Adoption agencies often do have some family medical
history on file. Your adoptive parents may or may not have this information
available for you, but the agency they used may. It’s worth a phone call or
visit to get any bits of information they have.
Regardless of whether you’re adopted, you may be unable to come up with
any concrete past family medical information. If that’s the case, don’t worry
about it. Doctors can use this info as a tool to help in some situations, but
medical personnel will use their expertise regardless of having any pertinent
family history.
Visiting the Doc
Some people would rather have a tax audit than go to the doctor. The main
reason? Fear — and fear of the unknown only perpetuates the problem. The
scenario of what ifs may run through your head like a freight train on rocket
fuel until you scare yourself into staying away from the doctor and convincing
yourself that nothing can be done about your less-than-healthy condition.
Note: This line of thinking may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you avoid
the doctor for years and suffer with an ache or pain long enough, it just may
turn into something serious. So when a person finally can’t take it anymore
54
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

and goes to the doctor, the news is bad. “Well, Mr. Jones, if you had come 
to me 12 years ago, we could have caught this thing in time. With the right
medication, lifestyle changes, diet, and exercise, you’d live another 20 years.”
Then the patient says, “Gee, Doc, with all the medical advances and technol-
ogy and your expertise, isn’t there anything you can do?” In a case like this,
nothing works better than prevention.
Taking your body to the doctor for regular checkups is an important part of a
living long and well. To make sure that you cover your bases, we devote this
section to those appointments.
Having regular checkups: 
What should happen
Remembering to schedule regular maintenance visits for your car is usually
easier than remembering to do it for your body. At least your car gets a
sticker that reminds you when to get an oil change or a warning light that
indicates a need for service. But as long as you’re feeling okay, you probably
don’t think about getting a physical exam — not good for two reasons:
 Prevention is the key to reducing your risks of developing disease and
illness, so if you don’t take advantage of your doctor’s insight regarding
your risks, you’re missing out on a key component of aging healthfully.
 When you do visit the doctor regularly, you can immediately address
any health concerns the doctor may find; if you don’t, you may not know
about those health concerns soon enough to combat them before they
take their toll on your body. For example, if your bad cholesterol levels
are too high, your doctor may suggest modifications to your diet and
lifestyle, or she may start you on a medication to lower cholesterol.
For folks ages 40 and older, we highly recommend health examinations every
one to two years. (Younger adults don’t need the exam this often — every
three to five years is good.)
During the annual exam, your doctor performs the assessments in the 
following sections.
Discussing current medical complaints
The first part of the exam is an opportunity to discuss your current medical
situation so that it can be further evaluated throughout the rest of the exami-
nation. You should discuss your medical complaints one at a time, mentioning
all the symptoms that you’re having. Your medical practitioner will ask some
directed questions, but this is your time to speak. A lot of valuable informa-
tion can be obtained in the history, often enough for clinicians to formulate 
a strong differential diagnosis.
55
Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Health and History and Setting Goals for Wellness

The review of your body systems is a way for the doctor to assess your over-
all health quickly (and sufficiently). You’ll be asked a number of questions to
gather information to direct the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, such
as the following:
 Overall well-being: Have you had unintentional weight loss or weight
gain? Do you generally feel well? Are you able to complete activities of
daily living?
 Skin: Do you have any rashes, itching, dryness, redness, or changes in
hair or nails?
 Eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and throat: Do you have any blurred, loss of,
or double vision? Do you feel any pain in the eyes? Do you have dizzi-
ness, loss of hearing, ringing in the ears, bloody nose, bleeding gums,
tooth pain, sore throat, hoarseness, lumps in the neck, or stiffness of 
the neck?
 Cardiovascular system: Do you have any chest pain, irregular heartbeat,
shortness of breath on exertion or during the night, or pain in the lower
legs with exertion?
 Respiratory: Do you have shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, bloody
sputum, or recurrent bronchial infections?
 Gastrointestinal: Any changes in appetite, pain with swallowing, heart-
burn, nausea, vomiting, bloody vomit, diarrhea or constipation, blood in
stool, increased gas, or pain with bowel movements?
 Genitourinary: Any increased frequency of urination, pain with urination,
blood in urine, problems urinating, history of kidney stones, recurrent
infections, erectile dysfunction (male), or sexually transmitted diseases?
Females, what was the age of onset of menses? Are your periods regular?
What was the date of your last period? Do you have any pain with 
menstruation, heavy or light bleeding, or pain with intercourse?
 Musculoskeletal: Do you have any pain in the joints, cramping, muscle
weakness, or decreased range of motion?
 Neurologic: Any seizures, tremors, numbness, tingling, paralysis,
memory loss, problems with coordination, anxiety, depression, or
speech difficulty?
Although routine medical examinations are supposed to be just that — 
routine — they’re often a time when patients divulge all the medical issues
they’ve experienced or been concerned about since their last medical exam.
Many patients come to routine examinations with multiple items to discuss,
or they answer “yes” to many of the questions in the preceding list. We want
to stress that if you have issues to be addressed, don’t wait until your routine
examination to address them. If the steering on your car is off, you don’t wait
until your 12-month inspection to have it evaluated; you shouldn’t ignore
symptoms affecting your most expensive possession — your body — without
having them checked out.
56
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

Reviewing past medical information
At this stage of the examination your doctor will want to go over past medical
information that may pertain to your current medical complaints. He’ll also see
whether any past medical issues need to be readdressed or further evaluated.
Your doctor may revisit the same question each year to make sure that nothing
has changed. Many past occurrences can be very important with current med-
ical ailments and future preventative examinations. Here are a few of the main
categories covered in this section of the examination:
 Medications: Tell your doctor about all the medications you’re taking
and about any recent changes in medications. Your medication includes
over-the-counter meds, herbal supplements, and anything you take for
allergies. Bring in the bottles or copy their info onto a piece of paper if
you don’t know all your medications off the top of your head.
 Past medical conditions or current ongoing conditions: These condi-
tions may include high blood pressure or diabetes and should date back
to childhood.
 Hospitalizations: Tell your doctor about any hospitalizations in the past
five years, and have all the details handy if you’ve been hospitalized in
the last 6 months.
 Surgical history: This category includes all surgeries in your life. Your
doctor won’t want to send you to the hospital to have your appendix
evaluated if it was surgically removed a year ago.
 Immunizations: See the Immunization section later in this chapter.
 For women, menstrual cycle and reproductive history: This info
includes all live births, the age of the children, and any miscarriages.
 Occupational history: This one helps the doctor evaluate any potential
hazardous exposures, such as asbestos or other chemicals, or hearing
loss if you work with loud machinery or guns. Jobs with intense labor
may explain pains in the back and joints or past head injuries.
 Relationship status: Talking about your relationship can help your doctor
understand the home environment if you’re experiencing stress or any
potential abuse situations. Knowing what kind of support network is at
home is also helpful for some ailments and treatment modalities.
 Alcohol and illicit drug use: Let your doctor know about past or 
present use. This includes tobacco and even the abuse of prescription
medications.
At this point, you can also whip out your comprehensive family history (see
the section “Looking down the family line,” earlier in this chapter) to help
your doctor assess for possible inherited problems and tendencies.
57
Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Health and History and Setting Goals for Wellness

Checking your vitals
Vital signs are a group of measured tests that help give a quick assessment of a
patient’s basic bodily function. These functions include blood pressure, pulse,
respirations, and temperature. A few other measurements can be thrown into
this mix, including height, weight, pulse oximetry (a noninvasive measure of
the oxygenation in your blood), and pain. Your doctor may check your vitals
herself. Or other medical personnel may do it before the doctor even sets foot
in the room. That way, she already has that info when she looks at your chart.
Sometimes this step happens at the beginning of your appointment, and some-
times it happens after you go over all the history (see the previous section).
Scan this list for additional info:
 Blood pressure measurement: Blood pressure is a measurement of the
force that’s applied to the heart and vessels as blood is pumped into the
heart chambers and out into the vessels of the body (not to be confused
with pulse, which is the number of times the heart beats in a given period
of time). In a blood pressure measurement, the first number (systolic) is
the rate at which the blood flows through your arteries during a contrac-
tion of the large chambers of the heart (ventricles), and the second
number (diastolic) is the pressure measured at rest when the ventricles
are filling. For example, a typical blood pressure reading is 120/80 mmHg
(millimeters of mercury).
By checking blood pressure regularly and following your care provider’s
advice regarding diet, exercise, medication, and risk-factor reduction,
you can help control your blood pressure and stave off heart disease.
 Temperature: You may think that everyone’s “normal” temperature 
when taken by mouth is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees Celsius.
Some research suggests that “normal” oral temp actually falls in a range
between 98 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Elevated body temperature of over
100 is called a fever. Fever can be caused by a number of things, such as
infection, some medical diseases, or heat stroke. Low body temperatures
occur with some infections and metabolic diseases, such as underactive
thyroid and diabetes. Abnormally low temperature is called hypothermia.
Most of the time, symptoms or pertinent medical history explains abnor-
mal temperatures. If not, the doctor does testing that may include an
examination, blood testing, urinalysis, and possibly X-rays.
 Pulse rate: The pulse is the pressure felt in the arteries as a result of 
the heart pumping. It’s most commonly felt on the neck or wrist and is
calculated as the number of pulses per minute. The normal pulse rate is
between 60 and 100 for adults and is higher in young children. The pulse
rate increases with exercise and can reach rates of greater than 200. In
addition to pulse rate, you can check for the strength of the pulse and
the rhythm — is it regular or irregular? A simple pulse check helps
assess potential problems with the cardiovascular system.
58
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

 Respiratory rate: This is the number of breaths a person takes per
minute. The rate is usually assessed when the person is at rest and can be
measured easily by observing the chest’s rise and fall while breathing. The
normal adult rate is between 12 and 20 breaths per minute and is higher in
children. Abnormal respiratory rates can be a result of medical conditions
such as fever, respiratory infections, or other systemic diseases such as
congestive heart failure and thyroid disease.
 Height and weight: These measurements are important. Changes in
height as you age may signify changes in your spine or posture. Weight
loss that’s unintentional can be related to numerous diseases. Weight
gain is becoming a norm and has numerous risks involved. Try to pick
up on changes in height and weight so that you can take action early.
(See Chapter 9 for more info on weight gain.)
At last, undergoing the physical exam
Sooner or later, you have to put on that skimpy gown and sit on the crinkly-
paper-covered exam table to get checked out. Your doctor examines you
from head to toe, checking most of your orifices, squeezing muscles, and
pointing out any abnormalities to discuss and possibly test further:
 General appearance: You’d be surprised what you can assess just 
looking at someone. Mobility, mood, skin color, and hygiene can all be
evaluated within a minute or two of general conversation.
 Skin: Doctors check the skin for any suspicious rashes or moles.
 Head, ears, eyes, neck, throat (HEENT): Examination of the head basi-
cally consists of checking the ears, mouth, and nose. Evaluating the visual
fields and papillary reaction, and testing with an eye chart are included in
an eye exam. To examine your throat, a doctor checks for neck stiffness,
thyroid enlargement, and lymph node swelling.
 Cardiovascular: The doctor checks your vital signs by listening to the
heart for any abnormal rhythm or sounds, checking for any swelling of
the extremities or varicose veins, and listening to the carotid arteries of
the neck for any signs of blockage.
 Respiratory: After checking the respiratory rate, your doctor listens 
to the lungs for any wheezing, lack of breath sounds, or other sounds
suggestive of disease.
 Gastrointestinal: Your doctor listens for bowel sounds, and presses on
the abdomen looking for pain, masses, hernias, or abdominal distention.
 Genitourinary and rectal: For men this includes evaluation of the penis
and scrotum, including evaluating the testicles for any masses. The female
exam is discussed in the next list (see the Pap smear bullet). Patients start
getting rectal exams at age 40 unless otherwise needed; doctors use this
exam to check for hemorrhoids and to evaluate the prostate for any
enlargement or masses.

 Musculoskeletal: Your doctor evaluates range of motion and muscle
strength, and checks the spine for straightness and any tenderness. Your
doctor also listens for crepitus, a creaking sound, when your joints are
moved.
 Extremities: Your doctor evaluates your extremities for swelling and any
abnormalities in the muscles. He feels the pulses in the knee and foot,
and looks for any enlarged lymph nodes in the groin.
 Neurological: The doc checks reflexes of the knees, feet, and elbow by
tapping them with a small hammer. Your doctor may check your gait by
watching you walk, and then check your feet and hands for sensory
defects.
Other tests are often done at the time of routine examinations and are just as
important, but not all these tests are done at every annual examination. A few
of these important tests are done at different set times or when other circum-
stances arise. Here are a few tests to expect at some point, whether annually
or not:
 Pap smear: From the time you become sexually active or turn 18
(whichever comes first), you should have a yearly Pap smear until age 30.
After age 30, women have Pap smears every three years after three yearly
negative tests in a row. Sexually active women ages 18 to 25 should also be
screened for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) and HPV (human papillomavirus), every year.
The vaccine for HPV can reduce the risk of cervical cancer and genital
warts (see the nearby sidebar on immunizations). Pap smears may be 
discontinued after age 65 if previous screenings (a minimum of three 
negative Pap tests in the last ten years) are normal and documented.
Multiple sexual partners, early onset of sexual activity, current use of
oral contraceptives, and smoking are increased risk factors for cervical
cancer. However, even without these factors, you should be tested to
help detect cervical cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment greatly
increase the success rate against it.
 Clinical breast exams and mammograms: Because breast care is one of
the most important aspects of women’s healthcare, clinical breast exams
should begin at age 20. Women age 40 and older should have a mammo-
gram every year. Detecting changes in the breast through clinical exams
and regular mammograms is the key to early diagnosis, effective treat-
ment, and high success rates against breast cancer.
A clinical breast exam involves palpating for lumps or bumps in each
breast. A mammogram is an X-ray of your breast that shows tissue
changes; your breast is flattened and compressed for the exam because
breast tissue is normally dense. This can be mildly uncomfortable.
 Prostate cancer screening: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer deaths among men. Each year, men age 40 and older should have:
60
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

• A prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening test. The PSA is a
simple blood test that in some cases can detect cancer in the
prostate before signs and symptoms are present. The only problem
is that it isn’t always accurate. A man can have prostate cancer
and still have a normal PSA. The PSA can also be abnormal when
cancer isn’t present thanks to certain infections, inflammation, and
benign enlargement of the prostate. Therefore, the PSA shouldn’t
be used as a diagnostic tool, but it can be helpful to monitor the
treatment of prostate cancer.
• A digital rectal exam. This test is done to assess the size of the
prostate and palpate for any other abnormalities, such as pain or
masses.
You must have both of these tests — a blood test alone isn’t a definitive
diagnostic test. Trust the doctor — if the PSA blood test was accurate
enough, doctors would be the first to tell you that you don’t need to
have a rectal exam. Unfortunately, that isn’t the case. Have both tests.
Early diagnosis and treatment greatly increase the success rate of a
cancer cure.
When you visit the doctor, you complete some general forms, one of which
should be a health assessment form or medical history — refer to the first
section in this chapter for more info on that topic.
Less frequent exams
Some tests need to be done only when you reach a certain age, have certain
risk factors, or are having problems in a particular area. The following list
describes some of the tests that fall into this category:
 Cholesterol screening: Every five years, all adults should have a lipid
profile, a cholesterol test done after you’ve had nothing to eat or drink
for 12 hours (called a “fasting” test) that assesses all the components of
cholesterol: total, HDL or good cholesterol, LDL or bad cholesterol, and
triglycerides.
The link between high cholesterol and the increased risk of heart dis-
ease is well established, so these tests can help determine your risk.
 Eye exam: Plan to have an eye examination at least once from age 18 to
29, at least twice from age 30 to 39, every two to four years from age 40
to 64, and every one to two years thereafter.
Many significant eye problems — like glaucoma (increased pressure in
the eye) and macular degeneration (deterioration of the macula, the cen-
tral part of the retina) — go undetected in adults until serious damage is
done. Certain health conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure
increase your risk of eye problems.

Immunizations
You may think immunizations are just for kids,
but some immunizations are as important for
adults as they are for children, especially if you
have certain risk factors. According to the
Center for Disease Control (CDC), the following
vaccinations should be on your to-do list if you
fall into any of the categories described here:
 Influenza: If you’re age 50 or older or if you
have a weakened immune system, you
should have these yearly flu shots. The
influenza vaccine can also be given to
anyone who requests it because it may
benefit the healthy working adult. Influenza
can lead to pneumonia, dehydration, and
death in people who are debilitated, and
can worsen heart disease, diabetes, and
asthma. Around 36,000 Americans alone die
from the flu and its complications each year.
 Tetanus Diphtheria Pertussis (Tdap):You need
this series of combined vaccinations if you’re
an adult who didn’t receive the primary series
as a child. In addition, all adults under age 65
should receive a booster(an injection given to
make sure the levels of protection in the blood
stay high) of Tdap at least every ten years
thereafter. Adults over the age of 65 should
receive a booster of Td (tetanus and diphtheria
only) every ten years. Tetanus is a preventable
disease caused by a bacteria introduced into a
wound, and it’s fatal in around 30 percent of
cases. Diphtheria, fatal in 5 to 20 percent of
cases, is a highly infectious preventable dis-
ease seen only rarely today in developed
countries due to high vaccine rates. Pertussis,
also known as whooping cough, is a highly
contagious, serious disease seen most
recently in those aged 11 to 19 when their
immunity wears off. New recommendations
for booster shots in children and adults are
needed and currently in the works.
 Pneumonia: If you’re 65 or older, or if you
have medical conditions that increase the
risk of pneumonia — such as chronic lung
diseases (asthma, bronchitis, emphysema),
chronic heart conditions, diabetes, kidney
disease, or liver disease — you should have
a one-time pneumonia vaccination (pneu-
mococcal vaccine or pneumovax). In some
cases, a second vaccine after five years
may be prudent; ask your doctor whether
you fall into this category.
 Human Papillomavirus (HPV): This relatively
new vaccine is recommended for young
females (starting at age 9 and up until age 26)
to decrease the risk of cervical cancer and
genital warts due to HPV. Ideally, you should
receive this vaccine before becoming sexu-
ally active, but women who are sexually
active should still be vaccinated. A complete
series of this vaccine consists of three
doses. At this time the vaccine is known to
be effective for at least five years; further
research will determine whether or not
booster injections will be required.
 Meningitis: Although meningitis is rare, out-
breaks on college campuses or other areas
where large numbers of people live in close
contact, such as military bases and institu-
tions, can occur. Therefore, the following
people should receive the meningitis vac-
cine (called the meningococcal vaccine):
college students, military recruits, people
with immune problems, people with dam-
aged or removed spleens, people traveling
to countries where meningitis is common,
and anyone who has been exposed to
someone with meningitis.
 Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is a virus that can
cause serious damage to the liver.
Vaccination consists of a series of three
vaccines. The following people, among
others, should receive the hepatitis vac-
cine: medical personnel; people with HIV,
kidney disease, or liver disease; and people
who receive blood products on a regular
basis, such as hemophiliacs.

 Fasting blood sugar screening: Fasting blood sugar should be measured
every three years, starting at age 45, to screen for diabetes mellitus, one
of the most commonly undiagnosed diseases.
Certain risk factors such as family history, excess weight, and inactivity
raise your chances of developing diabetes. Untreated, the complications
can be serious; diabetes can cause severe kidney, nerve, eye, heart, and
blood vessel damage. But early diagnosis and treatment can greatly
reduce risks of complications, improve your health, and control the 
diabetes.
 Colorectal cancer screening: A complete colonoscopy and examination of
the intestines are done using a flexible lighted scope while you’re under
mild sedation. People age 50 and older should have this test done every
ten years — and more frequently if you have a family history of colon
cancer or a previous abnormal colonoscopy.
Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer deaths among all
adults, and a colonoscopy offers the best opportunity to detect cancer
at an early stage, when successful treatment is likely. Some cancers may
be prevented by detection and removal of polyps.
 Bone-mineral density exam: Women age 65 and older should have a bone
mineral density measurement at least once to check for osteoporosis, a
disease in which bones become fragile and more likely to break.
Because osteoporosis isn’t visible, the information from a bone density
test enables your healthcare provider to identify your risk of fractures.
 Hearing test: Adults over the age of 64 should have at least one hearing
assessment. Your healthcare provider will ask about your hearing, and if
you’re having difficulty or noticing small changes, he will probably rec-
ommend a hearing test. Proper treatment, including cleaning or treating
infections, can greatly improve your ability to hear.
Determining Your Goals and 
Putting Them on Paper
To achieve goals, you need plans. No architect creates a building and no 
engineer creates a computer without a written plan. You’re the architect and
engineer of your lifestyle, and you need a plan when building for healthy
aging. Your plan of action acts as a set of blueprints for the changes you want
to create for your health and well-being. The plan turns your major goals into
a multitasked project with clear milestones and deadlines and specific tasks in
a specific order.
The simpler the plan, and the less disruption it causes to your daily life, the
more likely you are to stick to it. Think of your body as a machine that needs
63
Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Health and History and Setting Goals for Wellness

certain maintenance. Plan on the regular, routine maintenance and if any signs
of breakdown appear, get to the doctor sooner rather than later to prevent
any worsening of the situation. The body is complex and therefore is some-
what unpredictable, so accept that you have to adapt to changes and make
adjustments to keep the body aging well. Have you ever seen a set of blue-
prints that didn’t have changes before the final construction was complete?
Your plan will also have modifications along the way.
Developing your goals
When determining and implementing your goals, follow a few guidelines to
make them effective:
 Develop your goals as clearly as possible. Your goals should be deliber-
ate and well thought out. Each goal should be defined as a specific task
that’s action oriented. If it’s action oriented, you can actually do some-
thing to accomplish it. Having a goal of “losing weight” isn’t as clear as
“losing five pounds a month by cutting out afternoon and after dinner
snacks and walking two miles a day.” The second goal has specific,
action oriented tasks for you to work on.
 Make sure that your goals are measurable. This factor is critical. If 
you can measure your goals, you can manage them. Just like in a game 
of sports, if you don’t assign a point value to a score, how do you know
who’s winning? With goals, if you can’t measure them, how do you know
whether you’ve accomplished them? The difference between a goal and
a wish is as simple as these two statements:
• I want to lose weight.
• I want to lose 25 pounds.
The second statement is actually a goal.
 Set firm but realistic deadlines. There isn’t much point of having a goal
if you never set a time frame to reach it.
 Own your goals. Many people don’t stick to their goals because they
don’t really take ownership of them. Your goals must be a burning desire
for you — not for someone else. If you’re a smoker and the loved ones 
in your life want you to give it up and you know that you should (but
you’re trying to do it for their sake), you aren’t really owning this goal.
Feeling the conviction and desire for your goal is essential because you’ll
encounter obstacles, challenges, and temptations that try to sabotage
your attempts. Whether your goal is going to the gym four days a week,
eating healthy food to lose weight and maintain it, choosing a positive 
attitude over a negative one, or protecting your skin from sun damage —
every goal has obstacles. Choose goals that you’re passionate about.
You’re much more likely to achieve them.
64
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

Keep these guidelines in mind and start fine-tuning your goals by letting the
following questions and considerations guide you:
1. What’s your current state of health?
• Weight
• Medical conditions
• Exercise and physical activity
• Nutrition and diet
• Mental, emotional, and spiritual
2. Where would you like to be with regards to your health and well-
being?
3. How did you get where you are today regarding your current state 
of health?
• What did you do right?
• What would you do differently?
4. What do you do next to get from where you are to where you want 
to be?
5. What should you be doing more or less of?
6. What should you start doing that you aren’t?
7. What should you stop doing altogether?
8. Can you set realistic timeframes for each of your goals?
9. Where do you want to be in one year in relation to your goals?
Change is good, although for many people it can be uncomfortable. Discomfort
often comes from fear of the unknown or fear of failure. If you notice a gap
between where you want to be and where you are now, see it as an opportunity
for improvement, rather than an insurmountable obstacle or a failure; don’t let
fear keep you rooted in the same old spot.
Recording your goals
Plenty of research supports the effective correlation between writing down
your goals and achieving them. Here’s why we also believe in the power of
this process:
 Writing down your goals forces you to organize your thinking.
 Thinking about what you must do to accomplish your goals helps you to
plan your tasks more thoughtfully.
65
Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Health and History and Setting Goals for Wellness

 A well-written plan provides the ability to review it for flaws as well as to
identify strengths and weaknesses.
 A written plan allows you to focus on just a few key objectives.
 Writing your plan ahead of time instead of flying by the seat of your
pants saves time, energy, confusion, and mistakes.
You may want to keep your plan in a notebook or a three-ring binder that’s
easy to refer to on a daily basis. As you write your plan
 List every task and activity. For example, if you want to start exercising,
list the activity you want to begin, the time you want to allot, the time of
day you’re going to exercise, and where you’re going to exercise. You also
need a schedule for starting slow and increasing your exercise time and
intensity.
 Prioritize your goals. What’s the most important thing you hope to
accomplish? If you’re losing weight because you’re diabetic, changing
your diet to decrease your blood sugar may be more important than
how many pounds you lose.
 List your goals sequentially. You may want to increase your aerobic
exercise to a certain point first, and then start using weights. Or you
may want to start with one weight, and then increase to another level.
 Identify your limitations. Limitations aren’t failures, and should be built
into any plan. For example, you may have a chronic foot injury. If you
know that the injury flares up from time to time, have an alternate plan for
those times, such as switching from walking to swimming for exercise.
 Expect failure and remain flexible, keeping your focus on the solution.
 Have measures and standards for tracking your progress and dead-
lines. For example, “I will be walking three miles daily at a speed of 4
miles an hour on the treadmill.”
All successful people work from written plans. Action without planning is the
number one reason for failure.
Pushing for Persistence to Successfully
Reach Your Goals
Making plans and setting goals is fun; carrying them out can be less enjoyable,
especially over the long run. Yet few things are as rewarding as completing
goals, so the effort is well worth it.
You may not always feel like keepin’ on, but by starting small and gradually
increasing your efforts and goals, you can achieve great changes that can
66
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

impact the way you age for years to come. The road to the top seems much
easier if you take your goals one step at a time, stay realistic about what you
can do, and find support along the way.
In this section, we focus on the mental side of carrying out your goals —
especially when the ruts and bumps start to rattle your confidence.
Staying focused — and optimistic
Few things in life are more motivating than a realistic positive attitude.
Referring to your plan and rechecking it to make sure that your goals are real-
istic and attainable can keep you from giving up because your goals aren’t
being met. Being both realistic and positive is essential: Being positive may
tell you that you’re going to be 30 pounds thinner in a month; being realistic
may tell you that’s not likely and that 4 to 8 pounds (1 to 2 pounds a week)
may be a better goal.
Sometimes, despite your most upbeat efforts, pessimism starts to worm its
way into your daily routine. “What’s the use? I’ll never get there” becomes
your new mantra, and it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
To be successful at goal-setting and attainment, the most successful people
use a powerful tool called visualization. Imagine yourself as your ideal self
and keep that focus. For example:
 See the action-oriented goals you need to accomplish in order to
become that healthy person you want to be.
 See the obstacles in your way and visualize removing them from 
your path.
 See yourself where you want to be and who you want to be and lock 
in on those images.
The more often you visualize your ideal, the closer you come to attaining it.
You can even write down a detailed description in your notebook of what you
see to help reinforce the images. As you review your goals every day, visualize
yourself acting them out and accomplishing them. Be sure you refer to this list
when you’re stuck or off track.
As we mentioned earlier, the process of goal-setting takes practice. The most
successful people in the world fail more times than unsuccessful people do.
And successful people have failed at meeting a goal on time. You’re the boss
of your own body, and it’s counting on you not to quit. If you don’t meet a
goal or deadline, set a new one! If you have a big goal, break it down into
smaller, more manageable tasks. Just don’t give up!
67
Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Health and History and Setting Goals for Wellness

How often should you review your goals? It depends on how quickly you want
to achieve them. Some people review their goals daily, and we think this is a
good plan. The more often you use your goals and act on them, the better you
get at creating goals, solving problems, and achieving the results you want.
Measuring your progress
Almost nothing is more satisfying than a written record of success. Forgetting
how far you’ve come is easy when you don’t have a tangible record of it. By
setting specific measures on your goals and accurately tracking your perfor-
mance each day, you reinforce the changes to your health and well-being (like
incorporating healthy choices and maintaining a positive mental attitude)
and make it easy to refer to when you need to revise goals.
Jotting down notes related to your activity is also helpful. For example, did
you feel especially hungry on a given day? Tired? Angry? Were certain exer-
cises extremely difficult to do, or was a certain activity impossible to con-
tinue because of fatigue? Knowing what worked for you and what didn’t can
help you plan a more realistic and successful plan.
One easy way to keep track of your diet and exercise is online at a Web site
like www.fitday.com or www.myfooddiary.com, which is only $9 per
month. The Web site www.mapmyrun.com allows you to map your biking or
jogging routes and change them and save them according to the distance. If
you want something that you can hold in your hand that’s already laid out for
you, a company called BodyMinder sells journals for recording anything
related to exercise and diet. Look in the fitness section in any bookstore for
different choices to see what fits your needs best.
Removing obstacles and 
getting back on track
On your course to a healthier lifestyle, you’re going to experience detours,
potholes, bottlenecks, and of course, the occasional flat tire. All the more
reason to set goals; they can’t prevent obstacles, but when they’re written
clearly, action-oriented, and measurable, they can help you get up and going
again. To minimize the obstacles that may block your path, we recommend 
a three-step approach:
1. Identify your obstacles.
Don’t take it personally — goals aren’t about perfection but reality.
Building failure into your plan just makes sense.
68
Part I: So You Want to Look and Feel Young Forever . . . 

For example, maybe your goal is to improve your lean muscle mass by
20 percent in six months with strength training. You plan to work out
with weights four days a week, one hour each session. Three months
into your goal, you’re in a car accident and in the hospital for a week.
Your recovery period puts you behind schedule and you can’t make it
back to the gym for three months. You failed to meet your goal. What do
you do? Set a new goal.
Your roadblocks can come from work, family, or financial obligations, or
they can be less tangible factors like motivation. When you can identify
them, you can prepare for and overcome them when they occur. You can
have a Plan B.
2. Prioritize the obstacles in the order you need to overcome them.
By prioritizing and writing them down on paper in your planning note-
book, you can see what’s standing between you and your goals. No matter
how challenging the obstacle, write it down. For example, if your biggest
obstacle to exercising is that your fitness center’s hours no longer fit your
schedule, list Look for ways to change schedule to get to gym as a priority,
with Look for a new gym as a second priority if the first fix isn’t possible.
The more you practice problem-solving skills, the better you become at
resolving these roadblocks and the more quickly you achieve your goals.
You also realize just how often obstacles come across your path and you
become more confident at setting larger or more challenging goals.
3. Rewrite a new goal to address each obstacle.
In Step 2, a person who can’t find time for exercise may need a new, more
specific goal. He may have to write find 30 minutes three times a week to
exercise by cutting out XYZ (replacing XYZ with a real event). This sugges-
tion may sound simple, but change isn’t always easy. He may have to elim-
inate 90 minutes of something he enjoys, like watching TV or spending
time on the computer.
To overcome obstacles, your goals must be desirable and you must be 
committed to them.
Finding support
Unless you’re a Lone Ranger type (and even he had a sidekick!), you’re likely 
to find lifestyle changes like dieting, quitting smoking, and starting an exercise
program much easier if you have company along the way. A good friend or a
whole support group of people can encourage you, help you get back on track
when you waver, and cheer you on when you succeed. Plus, a little healthy
competition may spur you all on to success. The beauty is that you can find
people who specialize in helping you achieve your goals if you find it hard to
go it alone.
69
Chapter 3: Evaluating Your Health and History and Setting Goals for Wellness

Finding support for specific goals can be simple. Want to quit smoking? Find a
friend or relative to team up with, or join a group like Nicotine Anonymous, a
spinoff organization of Alcoholics Anonymous. Diet plans? You can find dozens,
both online and live, to choose from. Not interested in baring your problems in
public? Look for the hundreds, if not thousands, of online support groups for
every type of issue under the sun, including support for specific diet plans and
forums that discuss exercise videos made by different groups or individuals.
Just making your goal known to someone else — even if it’s just your mom or
best friend — increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with it. Want to make
the stakes higher? Organize a group where each person contributes a mone-
tary amount and the person closest to his or her goal after a set time wins the
pot. Or make your own personal reward system; put money toward something
you really want and then hand the money to someone else to “keep” for you
until you reach your goal.
“Going it alone” can be successful, but it can be a lonely road. Team up with
friends or make some new ones and the journey toward your goals will seem
much shorter — and a lot more fun, too.

Chapter 4
Putting Your Best Face Forward
In This Chapter
 Discovering the means of good oral health
 Figuring out ways to keep your ears healthy
 Keeping clear and healthy eyes
Your face is the first thing people relate to when they meet you. Are your
eyes bright, your teeth gleaming, your ears open, and your breath fresh?
While making a first impression is important, leaving a lasting impression 
on your health as you age is even more important. Letting your eyes, ears,
mouth, and teeth fall into disrepair can have far reaching consequences for
your general health, especially as you age. Periodontal disease is seen in a
majority of the adult population, and age-related hearing and vision loss are
both in the top eight most prevalent chronic conditions in older Americans.
These areas of the body are very common sources of medical visits and many
of the problems related to them could be avoided with preventative measures.
In this chapter, we look at your face, and we talk about keeping your eyes,
ears, mouth, and teeth healthy.
Your Mouth, from Cradle to Golden Years
Think a healthy mouth is all about straight teeth or whitening strips? Even
worse, do you think having a healthy mouth consists of making sure your
dentures stay in place while you eat corn on the cob? Sure, these things are
important, but they don’t have a long lasting effect on your health. Taking
care of teeth, mouth, and gums takes more than cosmetic effort.
In elementary school, you were taught to brush and floss your teeth twice a
day to avoid getting cavities. You were also told to avoid the kinds of foods
that cause cavities (like sugary snacks and sticky foods that get stuck in your
teeth). Armed with this important knowledge, you were off to face the world
with a milky-white smile and the confidence that you could remain cavity- and
infection-free for life.

Twenty (or more) years later, you’re sitting in that very comfortable dental
chair as the hygienist pokes around your gums and measures the depth of
those pockets around your teeth. And you’re cheerfully told that you have
periodontal disease, a condition where the bacteria in plaque (the sticky, 
colorless film that covers your teeth) causes your gums to become inflamed.
Your cheerful hygienist (sure, she’s cheerful — these aren’t her teeth) tells 
you that some of your pockets are deep enough that they’ve become infected.
They need to be treated with an injection or you’re at risk of bone loss and
eventually losing your tooth. She tells you that you also need to
 Brush and floss more
 Swish with antiplaque/antigingivitis rinse
 Add an anticavity, high-fluoride rinse
 Keep regularly scheduled checkups
You can’t imagine how you’re supposed to have time to earn a living, take
care of a family, and keep up with all this tooth work at the same time. (Read
more about periodontitis in the section “Open Wide! What You Need to Know
about Oral Health.”)
Moving into your 60s and 70s, you have other concerns about your mouth, like
how you’re going to pay for dental care and food at the same time. Or you may
have other medical concerns that overshadow your oral healthcare. The ability
to brush and floss is often difficult for seniors because of physical limitations.
Getting to dental appointments can also be a challenge for seniors who lack
access to transportation.
The point is that at any point in life, taking care of your teeth can be a pain.
But teeth are around for a long time — or should be. What you do when
you’re young has long-term consequences on your future mouth health, but
all isn’t lost if you didn’t own a toothbrush until you were 36. Understanding
what can go wrong with your mouth can help keep problems from happening.
Open Wide! What You Need 
to Know about Oral Health
From periodontal disease to cancer, your mouth can be a source of pain and
disease ranging from a mild nuisance to a disabling condition. Dentures are
becoming routine practice, but the sad part is that it can often be prevented.
74
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

75
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward
Grab your toothbrush and dental floss and throw away your cigarettes and
sweets, not just for your teeth, but because brushing and flossing can also
prevent diseases in other parts of your body. In fact, some studies link the
same bacteria that cause mouth disease with other chronic conditions such
as heart disease and diabetes.
Outlining the top two oral health concerns
Two common oral health concerns that are often not discussed are tooth
decay and periodontal disease. Tooth decay is the most common chronic
childhood disease, and it continues on as you age. Periodontal disease effects
your gums. This disease is also very common and potentially dangerous.
Both are preventable, but with poor lifestyle choices starting with the
younger population, these problems are becoming an uphill battle.
In this section, we provide information for you to face this battle, so don’t
rush and grab your toothpaste and floss just yet.
Tooth decay
You may not know it, but your mouth is continually trying to wear down your
teeth. The bacteria that occur naturally in your mouth mix with your saliva
and bits of food in your mouth to form a coating (dental plaque) that sticks 
to your teeth. When this plaque hardens, it becomes tartar.
The acids in both the plaque and the tartar wear away the teeth’s enamel. These
acids can get inside the teeth and create holes or cavities. Tartar forms a rough
area on the teeth and can be stained much more easily than healthy enamel.
Everyone is at risk for getting cavities throughout life. By the time they’re
adults, 85 percent of people will have had a cavity! Here are a few activities 
that increase your risk of tooth decay; we’re sure you’ll recognize a few:
 High sugar and carbohydrate diet: These types of foods attract the 
bacteria that cause tooth decay. Combine poor diet with poor dental
hygiene and presto, you have tooth decay.
 Lack of dental care: Regular cleaning is needed to remove plaque and
bacteria from the teeth and gums. Dental care includes both your own
daily regimen and routine follow-up with your dentist.
 Smoking: Smokers have more tooth decay than nonsmokers. One reason
is that smokers produce less saliva, which cleans the teeth and inside of
the mouth. Smokers also have a higher incidence of gum disease,
because smoking decreases blood flow to the gums.
 Fluoride deficiency: Fluoride helps teeth ward off the acids that can
erode the enamel. Some water supplies don’t have fluoride added in so
check with your local water company and then pick up some fluorinated
toothpaste!
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward

As people age, they produce less saliva allowing more bacteria to accumulate
in their mouths making the teeth even more susceptible to tooth decay and
fractures. These bacteria don’t stop at the teeth and if allowed eventually
wreak havoc on your gums and become a major instigator of bad breath.
Periodontal disease
Periodontal disease, a chronic bacterial infection of the gums and the area
between the teeth and gums (the sulcus), is a common problem affecting
about 80 percent of the adult population. It begins when the bacteria and
other food particles that cause tooth decay move down into the gums. If left
untreated, this condition can turn into mild gum inflammation and then into
serious gum disease that can affect not only the gums but also the teeth and
supporting bone. When periodontal disease advances, the infection infiltrates
the bone structures that hold the teeth in place and ultimately can lead to
tooth loss. Early stages of the disease can be painful and, if not approached
aggressively, the disease can be destructive and costly.
Periodontal disease is classified according to the severity of the disease as
gingivitis or periodontitis. Gingivitis is reversible, but when left untreated, it
can lead to the more serious periodontitis. Periodontitis is the most common
cause of tooth loss among adults. Here are some additional facts about 
the two:
 Gingivitis: Your gums can become inflamed and reddened. They may
even bleed, especially when you floss. Most of the time, you have no
associated pain. This condition is reversible if you seek dental treatment
and initiate good dental hygiene at home.
 Periodontitis: If you fail to treat your gingivitis, you may end up with
this more serious inflammatory condition. The inflammation causes the
gums and bone to start receding leaving small pockets around the teeth
for more bacteria and plaque to congregate. This continues the disease
process and eventually the bone may extend where the teeth are
anchored and tooth loss may result.
Some risk factors for periodontal disease include
 Smoking: Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals including
formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, ammonia, arsenic tar, and nicotine.
These chemicals affect gum healing by decreasing blood flow and also
causing inflammation of the gums.
 Dry mouth: Dry mouth (xerostomia) is decreased production of saliva.
Saliva is needed in the mouth to wash away food particles and bacteria.
Saliva can neutralize acids and therefore deter plaque formation. See the
sidebar later in this chapter, entitled “Coping with a dry mouth: More
than just a nuisance.”

Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward
 Hormonal changes in females: Hormonal shifts that cause elevated levels
of progesterone increase your risk of gum disease. Pregnancy, parts of the
menstrual cycle, and possibly some birth control pills can all result in 
elevated progesterone levels. Progesterone dilates blood vessels and can
block collagen, which can lead to swelling and inflammation. Gum disease
is a common complaint during pregnancy and right before periods begin.
 Diabetes: Research supports that diabetics with poor control of their
blood sugars are more likely to develop gum disease. Because diabetes
affects immune function and increases risk of infection, it’s more difficult
for diabetics to fight off the bacteria that causes periodontal disease.
 Medications: A few medications are implicated in gum disease. Oral 
contraceptives, anti-depressants, and some blood pressure medicines
are found to cause dry mouth. Other medications, such as anti-seizure
and some heart medications, can cause the gums to enlarge, which can
increase inflammation and increase collection of plaque.
 Genetic susceptibility: It isn’t clear what the genetic link is, but it’s esti-
mated that about 30 percent of the population have an increased suscepti-
bility to periodontal disease. This requires these people to pay more
attention to preventative measures and regular dental care.
Understanding how an unhealthy mouth
may affect the whole body
Unfortunately, periodontal disease doesn’t stop at your teeth and gums.
Many researchers have a particular interest in these pesky oral bacteria and
possible links to other diseases, such as heart disease and respiratory infec-
tions. Numerous studies link heart disease to common bacteria associated
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward
Grappling with the effects of tooth loss
Losing teeth isn’t just a social embarrassment. You
may not know that when you lose your teeth, you
also lose bone in your jaw, and eventually your
face starts to sag. The aging process accelerates
at a rapid pace whether you lose your teeth at 45
or 75. Bone loss can also make dentures loose
and difficult to wear. The more jawbone that’s
worn away, the less available bone you have to
secure the dentures.
Dental implants can help prevent bone loss follow-
ing a tooth extraction. As common replacements
for missing or fractured teeth, dental implants are
permanent fixtures of titanium posts that are
anchored to the jawbone and topped with individ-
ual replacement teeth or a bridge that screws or
cements into the posts. Implants may replace one
tooth, be a combination of several implants (a
bridge), or work in combination with dentures.

with periodontal disease. (See the sidebar “Conjecture or link?” in this chap-
ter for more info.) The American Academy of Periodontology states that
people with periodontal disease have nearly twice the risk of coronary artery
disease. Research is ongoing, but for now, aggressively treating periodontal
disease may help you reduce the risks of some common and serious diseases
such as the following:
 Heart disease: Patients with valvular heart disease (rheumatic heart 
disease, congenital valve problems, previous endocarditis or infection
involving a heart valve, and previous valve replacement) are at risk of
valve infection. Bacteria can enter the tiny scrapes and cuts that are
inevitable during dental or surgical procedures and end up on the heart
valves. If you have any of these conditions, or if you’re not sure, see
your medical doctor before having dental work done, because you may
need to take antibiotics prior to dental work.
A study published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association
studied 657 people without known heart disease. It found that people who
had higher blood levels of certain disease-causing bacteria in the mouth
were more likely to have atherosclerosis in the carotid artery in the neck.
 Diabetes: The Center for Disease Control estimates that 95 percent of
Americans with diabetes have periodontal disease due to the increased
susceptibility of diabetics to infections. Diabetic infections can be more
serious and harder to treat, so diabetics need to be especially diligent
about seeing their dentists every six months.
 Respiratory infection: Researchers have found that bacteria that
inhabit the oral cavity can be aspirated into the lung, causing respira-
tory diseases such as pneumonia. People with periodontal disease are
especially susceptible, and this risk could be preventable for those
already weakened by other diseases or those prone to respiratory 
infection.
Recognizing a quiet but increasing 
threat: The oral cancer epidemic
Oral cancer is the 6th most common cancer in men and 14th in women with
more than 30,000 new cases occurring each year. Many types of cancer are
frequently publicized in the news, increasing people’s awareness of their risk
factors and symptoms, but oral cancer doesn’t get much press. What’s most
disconcerting is that the number of new cases and the death rate from oral
cancer is up 11 percent from 2006. The Center for Disease Control estimates
that 75 percent of the cases of oral cancer are associated with smoked and
smokeless tobacco use.

Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward
If oral cancer isn’t diagnosed and treated in its early stages, it can spread,
leading to chronic pain, loss of function, irreparable facial and oral disfigure-
ment following surgery, and even death. If found early, oral cancer has a
promising survival rate, but a lack of dental care and the vagueness of the
symptoms can lead to delay in diagnosis. Many people discover oral cancer
only when it has metastasized to another location, most likely the lymph
nodes of the neck and beyond, at which point the prognosis is poor.
Risk factors for oral cancer
Unlike some cancers, oral cancer doesn’t have a large list of related risk fac-
tors. We can sum up the majority of the risk of oral cancer with two words
and neither should be of any surprise — tobacco and alcohol. The good news
is you have the choice to remove these major risks and the bad news is too
many seldom do.
Here are the risks in detail:
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward
Conjecture or link? Heart disease and gum disease
The potential link between heart disease and gum
disease is a topic of much debate in the medical
and dental community. Whether gum disease is
actually the direct cause of heart disease isn’t
crystal clear; however, the fact that medical sci-
ence and researchers keep looking for links and
finding them is enough to warrant mention. Read
on for some of the proposed mechanisms of the
gum disease (periodontitis) and heart disease
association.
First, the researchers stress that this possible link
between certain bacteria in the mouth and heart
disease isn’t yet fully studied. But here’s what
they found: Several strains of bacteria that cause
periodontal disease can enter the bloodstream
and travel to the heart, where they can cause
thickening of the arteries. Thickened arteries
reduce blood flow to the heart, increasing the risk
of heart attack. Thickened carotid arteries (arter-
ies that lead to the brain) can raise the risk of
stroke. To connect the dots, researchers have to
find out which came first, the thickened arteries
or the nasty bacteria in the mouth.
Studies show that the oral bacteria Streptococcus
sanguis does cause the clumping of blood platelets.
This clumping can be the first stage in the develop-
ment of a blood clot — the cause of a heart attack.
The periodontal infection reduces the health of the
lining of the gum tissues, which, in turn, allows 
bacteria from the mouth to enter into the underlying
tissues.
Patients with periodontitis have significantly
higher levels of inflammatory products (fibrino-
gen and white blood cells), which are well-
known risk factors for acute heart attacks.
Dental bacterial components affect the body’s
response to infection and can play a role in the
development of atherosclerosis.
New development in medical research is raising
further concerns that bacteria can cause heart
attacks. One bacteria, Chlamydia pneumoniae, has
been found in the walls of the blood vessels of
patients who have had heart attacks.

 Tobacco use: The main risk factor for oral cancer is tobacco use. Smoking
and the cancer connection is a popular theme that you pick up on in 
this book.
 Excessive alcohol consumption: An estimated 75 to 80 percent of people
with oral cancer consume alcohol. A large number of smokers also drink
heavily, making a direct connection between alcohol and oral cancer
harder to prove. Studies at this point indicate a higher risk for those who
both smoke and drink heavily.
 Sun exposure: Lips are also an area where oral cancer can occur; sun
exposure is definitely a risk factor for cancer of the lip. Block those rays
with sunscreen and/or a large brimmed hat.
 Age and gender: Another risk factor for oral cancer is age, with greater
than 90 percent of cases occurring in people over the age of 45. The
average age is around 60. Forty years ago, oral cancer had a 5 to 1 male
to female ratio, but now, the ratio is just 2:1. This is directly linked to the
increased rate of smoking in women.
Common symptoms of oral cancer
The most frequent oral cancer sites are the tongue, the floor of the mouth,
and soft palate tissues in back of the tongue, lips, and gums. Your dentist
probably performs a thorough screening for oral cancer each time you see
him — another good reason not to miss your dental appointments!
Now that we’ve brought oral cancer out into the light, here are a list of some
of the most common oral cancer symptoms:
 Non-healing sores: If you have a sore, blister, erosion, or bleeding in the
mouth or on your lip that doesn’t heal in 2 to 3 weeks, have it evaluated
by a medical doctor.
 Discolored patches: Any white or red patches on the tongue, lips, gums,
or lining the mouth should raise suspicion of cancer. These patches
require immediate attention.
 Lumps: Even if you don’t see discoloration, a lump needs to be evaluated.
If you have any lumps in the lip or mouth, have them looked at so that the
doctor can decide whether they need further evaluation.
 Difficulty swallowing: Any pain that you may have — whether it’s in the
throat, mouth, or when you move your tongue — should be evaluated.
Monitor your mouth for any of these symptoms and discuss them with your
doctor or dentist as soon as possible, particularly if you use tobacco products
or drink alcohol.

Tending to Your Oral Cavity — 
Your Mouth, That Is
We don’t know of anything more motivating toward improving your oral
hygiene than the sound of the infamous dental drill. We’re not asking you to
spend 45 minutes a day on each tooth; just a few minutes of attention goes a
long way. Your mouth deserves it, so now is the time to get out your mouth
cleaning tools and start cleaning.
Doing away with tooth decay
When you’re ready to do away with tooth decay, grab your tools — your
toothbrush, some dental floss, a good dentist’s phone number. This section
touches on the basics, but you may discover a thing or two about tooth care
that ultimately may keep you from hearing the dreaded dental drill. Most
important of all: Don’t think that dentist visits and cavities are just for kids;
the older you get the more important good dental care is.
Here are the basics of dental hygiene:
 Brush your teeth. Use a toothbrush with soft enough bristles that it does
not cause bleeding. Use short strokes and make sure that you get the back
teeth and the gums. Plan on getting a new tooth brush about every four
months or when the bristles are bent. It is hard to pick a brushing time
limit, but you should brush for 3 to 4 minutes. This routine is not only to
give you fresh breath, but also is the opportunity to get rid of the plaque
and bacteria that adhere to your teeth and gums. Don’t forget to brush
your tongue, but remember you have this thing called a gag reflex at the
back of the throat which doesn’t like toothbrushes.
Use a fluoride toothpaste because fluoride has been found to strengthen
the enamel on the teeth therefore making it more resistant to acids. If
possible, drink water that is fluorinated. If your teeth are particularly
vulnerable to cavities, use a fluoride mouth rinse at home — you just
swish once daily after brushing your teeth.
 Floss. There are several areas of the teeth that your brush won’t get 
and the only way to get to those areas is to floss daily. Flossing gets out
plaque and food pieces from between your teeth that the bristles from
your toothbrush just can’t reach. If you aren’t flossing then you aren’t
taking care of your teeth . . . period!
81
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward

 Schedule regular dental visits every six months. Yes, it’s a pain; you
dread it all week, but it’s important to get regular cleanings. The dental
hygienist is able to scrape away some of the plaque build up and scan
for cavities. They can also check for gum disease or erosion and screen
for suspicious lesions. Just do it.
 Eat the daily recommended intake of foods high in calcium to help
support strong teeth. Calcium poor diets can lead to bone loss and
weakening of the jaw bone, which holds your teeth. Eventually the bone
will weaken to a point where gaps are created around the teeth and can
accumulate and accelerate the effects of gum disease and tooth loss.
 Avoid carbonated drinks as much as possible. The carbonation, sugar,
and acid in the soda attract bacteria and form damaging levels of acid that
can eat away at the enamel of your teeth and contribute to tooth decay.

Coping with a dry mouth: More 
than just a nuisance
Dry mouth, called xerostomia,is a common occur-
rence and complaint with aging. It’s more than just
an annoyance, though; it can have harmful side
effects. Chronic dry mouth can lead to sores in the
mouth and cracking of the lips and corners of the
mouth, which can lead to infection. It can also
increase the risk of tooth decay from lack of saliva
to help wash away bacteria and food particles. Dry
mouth can cause bad breath, burning of the
tongue, dryness in the throat, and a chronic hoarse
voice.
Saliva glands often produce less saliva as you age.
Hundreds of medications, many prescribed for
age-related conditions, can cause dry mouth,
mostly due to the effects that the drugs have on the
parasympathetic nervous system. Drugs that are
known to cause dry mouth include the following:
 Allergy medications (antihistamines)
 Antidepressants
 Blood pressure medications
 Medications for urinary incontinence
Dry mouth is also a common side effect of cancer
treatment. Nerve damage to the face, neck, and
head; endocrine disorders; stress; and nutritional
deficiencies can also cause dry mouth.
Treating dry mouth can be difficult. If a medication
is the cause, talk to your doctor about possibly
substituting another medication for your condi-
tion. Your doctor may have a sample to try first,
that way you don’t have to pay for another pre-
scription that very well could carry the same side
effects.
Try drinking more water — most people don’t
drink enough water anyway. As you age, the
thirst sensation and the brain’s response to thirst
are sluggish and sometimes absent. Sucking on
certain candies can help, but you can eat only so
much candy.

Cutting out the sodas is a great idea, but if you do drink them,
researchers in Germany found that if you wait more than 30 minutes to
brush your teeth after soda ingestion you can preserve enamel.
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward
Bad breath: A sign of a deeper problem?
Halitosis is the medical term for bad breath —
clinical, chemical, offensive odor. For most
people, bad breath is situational and the result of
something in their mouths. But if a mint or mouth-
wash doesn’t do the trick, your dragon breath
may be indicative of a health concern. Bad
breath is often correctable with minimal effort —
if you know you have it. Hopefully you’re one of
the lucky ones whose friends are honest enough
to tell you or you figure it out on your own.
If you’ve determined the problem isn’t from coffee,
chips, a gyro, or something equally breathtaking,
then check your teeth and gums. Halitosis is often
a symptom of food caught between teeth, an
infected tooth, or gum disease. In these cases, try
the following remedies:
 Don’t skip brushing and flossing. And don’t do
it just once a day, either — try to brush every
time you eat something significant (this
approach may cut down on your snacking,
too!). Yes, it’s a chore — especially in the
middle of the day — to brush and floss, but
nothing else is as effective in removing those
evil bacteria that can cause disease and bad
breath. (And it also ensures that you don’t
walk around with a piece of broccoli stuck
between your teeth!) You may want to con-
sider using a water pick, which can remove
stubborn, stuck foods from hard to reach
places in your mouth.
 Do a pain assessment on your mouth. If your
teeth are painful or sensitive to hot and cold,
you may have an infected tooth. If you have
a painful lump on your gum, you could have
an infection there. Any mouth infection can
also cause bad breath — and you may have
a bad taste in your mouth if the area is leak-
ing pus. Call your dentist for an appointment.
 Take a look at your sinuses. If you have chronic
pain over your eyes, frequent headaches, or
pain over your cheekbones, you may have a
chronic sinus infection, which can lead to bad
breath.
 Drink something. Dry mouth can cause bad
breath, so make sure that you drink plenty of
water, and talk to your doctor if you feel that
your mouth is abnormally dry.
If you’re up-to-date on your dental visits and you
floss regularly but still have issues with bad breath,
look further down the pipes. The next common
causes of halitosis are problems with your stomach,
lungs, kidneys, or liver:
 Stomach problems that lead to chronic heart-
burn or reflux can cause bad breath.
 If you’re having coughing fits, fevers, or short-
ness of breath, a lung infection can cause
changes in your breath. See your doctor as
soon as possible.
 Kidney disease can give your breath an ammo-
nia smell, so see your doctor if you experience
this odor.
 Liver disease can cause your breath to smell
fishy. We strongly suggest you visit your doctor
immediately if you suffer from this.

Taking care of dentures
Having dentures doesn’t mean your dentist visits are over. Dentures needs to
be periodically checked for proper fitting, and dentures can cause problems
with your gums if they don’t fit well or when you’re first adjusting to them.
Poor fitting dentures can be painful, causing rubbing and wear against your
gums. Anytime you get skin abrasions, you increase your chances of infection;
this is especially true in your mouth, which is full of germs. Because you need
your dentures to talk, eat, and maintain a facial structure, taking them out
while your gums heal is a difficult option. And dentures must be clean, or they
can be an additional source of bacteria introduced into your mouth.
The following pointers are important for denture maintenance:
 Dental checkups: You may need new plastic added to the inside of the
existing denture to fill the expanding space between the denture and
gums due to the receding bone that can occur with aging and wear.
 Cleaning: This helps prevent bacteria from growing on your dentures.
Rinsing thoroughly also keeps foreign particles that can accumulate on
the dentures from irritating the gums. Don’t use harsh abrasives; use
products made especially for dentures. Keep your mouth and gums clean,
too, by brushing with a soft toothbrush and toothpaste. And make sure
that you use any rinse recommended by your dentist.
 Replacement: Dentures aren’t forever. A denture worn too long can
damage the facial appearance and the gums and cause a host of other
complications. For example, muscles for chewing and talking begin to
shorten to accommodate the decreasing space caused by the receding
bone between the nose and chin. The longer a person waits to replace

Fixing a broken tooth
Teeth are coated with the hardest substance in
your body — enamel. Breaking a tooth is no small
feat, yet it’s possible and occurs more often then
one may think. Fractured teeth may crack a long
time before they actually break, they may or may
not hurt, and they can’t heal like bones do.
So what should you do if your tooth just breaks?
Chances are good that the tooth that broke was
already cracked and under stress — the weak-
est link, if you will. It may have been weakened
by a filling, or it may have already had a small
crack. Because it didn’t have the ability to heal
itself like bone, it was just a matter of time (and
it usually happens just as you’re headed on
vacation).
If one of your teeth breaks, cover it with a ster-
ile gauze pad (pressing it firmly to keep it in
place and stop any bleeding), and call your den-
tist immediately. Don’t have a sterile gauze pad
handy? Try a paper towel or napkin. Also, avoid
sweet, hot, crunchy foods and liquids until your
dentist fixes the tooth. Instead, try foods that are
soft and are mild in flavor and temperature.

in a sad or aged appearance. If you’re doing routine denture maintenance,
but your dentures aren’t fitting well, it’s time to get a brand-new shiny set
of the pearly whites.
Can you Say “Eh?” Cleaning 
Out Your Ears
Have you noticed that the “volume” knob on your TV isn’t working all that
well these days? For some reason, you need to keep turning it up — and up.
And everyone around you is mumbling — can’t they just speak up? When
these things start happening — guess what? It’s probably you who has the
problem, not everybody else!
When people talk about aging, many can’t finish the conversation without
talking about hearing loss. The development of hearing deficits can really
impact your life or the lives of people around you. Often, loved ones are the
main catalysts to having your ears checked out, because they can’t take 
the high volume of the television, having to repeat themselves, and always
needing to yell. Most people are in denial about the situation. When someone
forces them to go to the doctor or convinces them that the hearing loss is
affecting their job or social life, they finally realize that they should have it
evaluated. Why do people wait? Mostly because they’re afraid of the end
result . . . hearing aids. Nobody wants to deal with the daily hassles of 
hearing aids.
Currently, over 20 million Americans suffer from hearing loss. It’s the third
most common chronic disabling condition, behind arthritis and high blood
pressure. About 250 million people have disabling hearing impairment, and
half of these cases are preventable.
A closer look at the causes of hearing loss
There are two types of hearing loss. One occurs when something is blocking
the transmission of the sounds such as wax, while the other is a result of
damage to the inner ear or the nerves that transmit sound signals to the brain.
Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) is a type of sensorineural hearing loss. It
occurs when you have a problem with the transmission of the sounds from
parts of the inner ear to your brain’s auditory cortex. Conductive hearing loss
occurs when the sound can’t reach the inner ear. Whenever you suffer from
hearing loss you may need specialized hearing tests and other diagnostic tools
to ultimately know what type of hearing loss you have and what’s causing it.
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward

Common causes of conductive hearing loss include
 Wax (cerumen) buildup (the most common)
 External and middle ear infections (middle ear infections, or otitis
media, are more common in children but can occur in adults)
 Perforated ear drum
 A tumor that lies directly behind the eardrum (this is rare)
Causes of sensorineural hearing loss include
 Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis)
 Noise induced hearing loss
 Tumor (acoustic neuroma)
 Autoimmune disorders
 Genetic disorders
 Meniere’s disease, a middle ear disease that causes dizziness 
and hearing loss
Presbycusis, also known as nerve deafness, begins around age 40 and gets
progressively worse as you age. Through the years of constant work, the little
hairs in the middle ear are damaged or destroyed, and sound waves aren’t
processed well. Presbycusis does tend to run in families, so you may want to
listen to see whether older family members have hearing difficulties and ask
them (loudly!) at what age it started.
Noise induced hearing loss is the most preventable cause of hearing loss.
Loud noises, such as explosions, gunfire, loud music, and other repeated
occupational noise exposures (jackhammer, flight lines, factories), are the
primary cause. That’s one reason why being a rock musician isn’t all that it’s
cracked up to be. More than 10 million people in the U.S. have noise induced
hearing loss. Will the current craze of having music blasting directly into your
ears 24/7 increase hearing loss in the future? It’s a possibility — turn down
the volume while you can still hear it!
Preventing hearing loss
Some causes of sensorineural hearing loss aren’t preventable, and the one
cause that can be prevented is only getting worse. The damage that occurs
with all the causes of sensorineural hearing loss is permanent without any
real effective cure. Although some hearing loss may be inevitable, you don’t
have to make it worse than it may already be.

Follow these tips for maintaining healthy and functioning ears:
 To prevent conductive loss
• Do not — and we really mean never — stick anything smaller than
your elbow in your ear canal. That means no cotton swabs. Often
they just pack the wax in the canal like arming a musket with a
ramrod.
• Let soapy water run in and out of your ears in the shower to keep
the wax out.
• Schedule regular ear cleanings with your doctor if you have 
recurring problems with wax buildup and aren’t able to clear it 
on your own.
 To prevent sensorineural loss
• The main prevention for noise and age-related hearing loss is a 
no-brainer . . . ear protectors. Use them in the form of earplugs or
earmuffs. If you love to share your music with the cars next to you
or with the people three machines over in the gym, you may want
to turn the volume down a few notches. Save your own ears and
everyone else’s too!
Can you hear me now? 
Treating hearing loss
If you have hearing loss, see your healthcare professional to find the cause. 
If you have decreased hearing along with fever or with accompanied pain,
you could have an inner ear infection or wax build up, which needs to be
evaluated by a medical doctor and treated.
Conductive hearing loss may be as easy to fix as having your doctor clean your
ears. If it ends up being earwax, you can do a few things to keep the wax from
building up in the ear canals. For example:
 Rinse your ears out with warm water and hydrogen peroxide.
 If ear wax is really packed, see your doctor for ear irrigation. You can
buy kits over the counter that can be effective; just make sure you use
the ear wax drops for a few days before trying to irrigate.
If you don’t have wax and your doctor diagnosed you with sensorineural hear-
ing loss, don’t get too discouraged. Fortunately, there’s a way to manage hear-
ing loss through the use of hearing aids. Unfortunately, many people don’t like
them, and to make matters worse, they’re not cheap and often not covered by
insurance. They’re often difficult to keep in the ear and static free; still, they
can be helpful and allow for better quality of life.
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward

There’s no cure for this type of hearing loss, so hearing aids don’t correct the
underlying problem; they just allow you to hear with assistance. Several com-
panies and models of hearing aids are out there, so shop around before you
buy. Find a company that will spend the time to teach you how to use the
hearing aid and get the best possible results. Many supply free batteries with
your purchase, too.
Examining and Preventing Age-
Related Eye Conditions
Vision changes are inevitable as you age, and there’s no real cure, just tools 
to compensate. In truth, most people have normal age-related vision changes;
others have vision changes associated with diseases, such as diabetes. Some
people retain good vision well into their 70s and 80s, but most people can
expect some visual impairment. The number of people with vision impairment
will increase in 2011 as the baby boomers turn 65 and double by 2030 as they
continue to age.

Considering LASIK
Getting rid of your glasses or contacts would cer-
tainly be nice, wouldn’t it? No more searching the
house or wearing a chain around your neck; no
more expensive new prescriptions at ever increas-
ing intervals. Yes, it would be nice — and thou-
sands of people each year choose to have LASIK
surgery. Do your homework first to increase your
odds of having a positive — and healthy — expe-
rience with LASIK surgery. Having realistic expec-
tations increases your chances of having a positive
experience.
LASIK surgery involves surgically changing the
contour of your cornea, the clear covering over the
front of your eye, by using a laser. LASIK can’t be
done if your cornea isn’t thick enough to be surgi-
cally altered. LASIK also can’t repair every type of
refraction error. If you have severe myopia, hyper-
opia, or astigmatism, LASIK may not work for you.
And although most people have excellent results
from LASIK, some have recurrent vision problems
or problems with glare or halos around objects.
LASIK only corrects presbyopia — normal age
changes in the eye — if a technique known as
monovision is used. With monovision, one eye is
corrected for distance vision and the other eye isn’t.
As with any surgery, and especially one that’s
done on an irreplaceable organ, do consider-
able research on doctors in your area. Don’t
choose by price — in fact, price should be your
last consideration. Choose a center that has a
proven track record. Ask about success rates,
infection rates, and complication rates. Ask
your primary doctor who she would have oper-
ate on her own family. If you know an ophthal-
mologist, ask for a recommendation.

89
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward
Normal age-related vision loss is called presbyopia. Presbyopia is caused by
hardening of the lens of the eye and usually begins after age 40. Presbyopia
isn’t a disease but rather a natural aging process, and it can be diagnosed by
a simple eye examination.
Presbyopia is the inability to focus on near objects but is different then being
farsighted (hyperopia), which is also associated with difficulty seeing close
objects. With presbyopia, you may start to have difficulty reading, using the
computer, or performing other day-to-day activities that involve things
nearby. People with presbyopia often hold reading material at arm’s length,
trying to bring the words into focus. You may also complain of a headache
from straining while reading or at work.
If your vision has never been corrected before, you may be able to get away
with using drugstore reading glasses for some time — maybe even forever. But
the most common treatment of presbyopia is prescription contact lenses or
glasses. Eventually, you may need bifocals or trifocals, which incorporate read-
ing glasses along with vision corrective lenses. You may also consider surgical
options for correction, such as LASIK (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis) and
lens implants. Consult your doctor to evaluate the best option for you.
Although presbyopia is a naturally occurring process rather than a disease, a
number of diseases do cause vision changes that have different symptoms and
treatments. Never assume that all vision loss in inevitable and unpreventable
until seen by a medical doctor. A number of these diseases can be treated and
the damage to your vision can be stopped or diminished. If vision changes
come on suddenly, see an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specializes
in treatment of the eye).
Seeing an eye doctor at regular intervals can help you recognize eye prob-
lems early and decrease further damage. Don’t assume that it’s just “normal
vision loss” if you start to notice poor night vision, blurry vision, or floaters.
The American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests the following exam
schedule for people who have no visual problems:
 Every 5 to 10 years under age 40
 Every 2 to 4 years between ages 40 and 64
 Every 1 to 2 years beginning at age 65
If you have diabetes or other medical ailments that can affect your eyesight,
make sure that they’re treated correctly and strictly. Eye examinations under
these conditions need to be done more frequently, usually at least yearly
unless recommended differently by your doctor. Report any sudden change
in your vision to your doctor immediately.
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward

Clouding eyes — cataracts
When clouding on areas of the lens in your eye keeps light from passing
through, you end up with cataracts. You may be developing cataracts if you
have blurred or double vision and sensitivity to light, including glares from
headlights, difficulty with night vision, and problems making out colors. If
you have to change your prescription lenses more frequently than you once
did, see a doctor, because this too could be a sign of cataracts. Cataracts may
be worse in one eye than in the other.
If vision changes start to interfere with your daily life, consider cataract
surgery. The damaged lens is removed in a same-day surgery procedure and
replaced with a synthetic lens made of plastic, silicone, or acrylic. If surgery
isn’t an option, wearing contact lenses or using strong magnifying glasses
may help.
Leaking retinas: Diabetic retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of vision loss for both type 1 and type 2
diabetics. Diabetes damages the blood vessels in the retina, causing them to
leak fluid. Virtually everyone who has diabetes for 30 years or more has some
degree of diabetic retinopathy. About 80 percent of people with diabetes has
some retinopathy after 15 years.
If you have diabetic retinopathy, you may notice that your night vision is
poor, or you may have floaters or blurry vision. See a retinal specialist as
often as your doctor suggests to keep diabetic retinopathy from worsening as
much as possible.
Diabetic retinopathy can be treated with a laser in the specialist’s office.
Early diabetic retinopathy is called nonproliferative; proliferative diabetic
retinopathy is a later and more severe stage.
The best thing you can do to prevent diabetic retinopathy is to try to keep
from developing diabetes in the first place. Eat a healthy diet, keep your weight
at a normal limit, and have yearly blood tests. If you do develop diabetes, keep
your blood sugars under control and see your specialists frequently. Not 
smoking and maintaining normal blood pressure are also vital.
The pressure’s up with glaucoma
Glaucoma results from increased fluid pressure (intraocular pressure, or IOP)
in the eye, which damages the optic nerve. There are two types of glaucoma:
open angle and angle closure. Open angle is by far the more common. If treated
90
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

91
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward
early, glaucoma can be controlled, but if left untreated, it can lead to loss of
vision or blindness. Glaucoma is diagnosed by having the pressure measured
by a special instrument called a tonometer, which measures the pressure in
your eye. Your doctor also examines your optic nerve after dilating your eye
with drops.
Glaucoma is treated by different types of daily eyedrops, which lower the
pressure in the eye. You need regular checkups to make sure the pressure
stays low, because glaucoma is usually painless.
Risk factors for developing glaucoma include race (glaucoma is the leading
cause of blindness among African Americans), family history, previous eye
injury, diabetes, high blood pressure, and extreme nearsightedness.
A decreasing ability to see straight 
(literally): Macular degeneration
The macula is located in the center of the retina, which is found at the back
of your eye. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) impairs central vision
and can make driving and other common daily tasks difficult. The two forms
of macular degeneration are
 Dry: A gradual breakdown of the cells of the macula
 Wet: From the formation of new, abnormal blood vessels grown under
the center of the retina
The dry type is much more common — and the wet type has much more
severe vision loss.
Only 10 percent of all cases of dry macular degeneration progress to wet.
Risk factors for developing macular degeneration include family history,
smoking, light-colored eyes, and eyes exposed to the sun over long periods of
time. People developing macular degeneration may have blind spots in their
central vision or blurriness or waviness in both the close and distant vision.
AMD has no known cure and there’s no treatment for dry AMD, although your
doctor may prescribe a type of multivitamin based on a study called the Aging
Related Eye-Disease Study (AREDs) to slow macular degeneration. You can
find these supplements, which should contain Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Vitamin 
A, Zinc, and Copper oxide, over the counter under a variety of name brands.
People with antioxidant deficiencies may suffer from macular degeneration
due to the free radical destruction of the retina. Implementing antioxidants
may improve these situations and also slow down other causes of AMD.
Chapter 4: Putting Your Best Face Forward

Other treatment options include intraocular injections and laser procedures for
the wet type of macular degeneration; although these may slow progression, at
this time, neither is a cure.
Recognizing retinal detachment
Retinal detachment occurs when the inner and outer layers of the retina sepa-
rate. The most common sign of retinal detachment is the sudden increase of
the amount of floaters in the eye. Some people have halos around lights or
bright flashes of lights, especially in the peripheral vision. You have no pain
with a retinal detachment.
Retinal detachment needs to be treated with surgical procedures, either laser
treatments or cryoplexy, which freezes the retina near the retinal tear, creating
a scar that secures the retina. These procedures may be done in the office by
an ophthalmologist who specializes in the retina or in the hospital as same-day
surgery. If retinal detachments are left untreated, the retina may detach 
completely, causing blindness in the eye.

 Caring for your skin: protection, hydration, and exercises
 Undoing — or minimizing — the mistakes of the past
Your skin is the first line of defense against the outside world, and it takes
a beating. Skin gets overheated, dried out, slathered with lotions and
potions, scraped up, wrinkled, and wind burned, and the effects of the abuse
you heap on your skin becomes more evident as you age.
In this chapter, we look at your skin with a magnifying glass, identifying the
effects on your skin of too much sun, too little moisture, smoking, and an
inadequate diet, among other things. We load you up with skin-care tips to
help you avoid skin cancer and wrinkles. Although we can’t guarantee that
you’ll keep the baby soft skin you came into the world with for your whole
life, we can guarantee that taking proper care of your skin keeps it — and 
you — looking younger for longer.
A Primer on Your Body’s Shell
Although you’ve probably heard the saying that beauty is only skin deep, 
it’s obvious that society in general doesn’t believe it. Most of the skin-care
products on the market stress one thing — how it makes your skin look.
But there’s much more to skin than its outward appearance. Skin covers your
body for a reason — and although attracting a potential partner may be one 
of the reasons, it isn’t the most important. The following sections educate you
on the importance of the skin you’re in, and why you can’t live without it.

Your skin’s all-important roles
Your skin is an organ (a body structure containing two or more different
types of tissue that work together) — the largest organ of your body, in fact.
Although your skin looks all of a piece from the outside, it’s actually made
up of three different layers, each with its own function. Your skin protects
your insides from getting out and the outside world from getting in. More
specifically, skin
 Serves as a waterproof barrier, keeping necessary moisture in your body
where it belongs without allowing your insides to be flooded every time
you get in the shower
 Keeps harmful bacteria, viruses, and other toxic elements from entering
the body
 Regulates body temperature by releasing water and other toxins in the
form of perspiration when you’re hot and contracting tiny muscles
(goose bumps) around hair follicles when you’re cold
 Acts as a sensory receptor, allowing you to feel pain (a warning that
something harmful is touching the skin) so that you pull away, pleasure
(no pulling away there), and temperature changes so you protect your
skin from damage from excessive cold or heat
Your skin weighs about 8 to 11 pounds, and stretched out, it would cover 12 to
20 square feet! It’s made up of 70 percent water, about 25 percent protein, and
3 to 5 percent fat. Dead skin makes up a majority of the dust in your house.
Your skin’s anatomy and how it functions
Skin is more complicated than it looks on the outside. The three layers of the
skin — the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous — each are further broken
down into different layers. As you age, changes in your skin can make it more
susceptible to damage — some visible, some not. Understanding what goes 
on “beneath the surface” can help you keep your skin from showing its age.
The three skin layers (and their sub-layers) each have a separate function:
 Epidermis: The epidermis is made up of five sub-layers. The top, 
very thin layer, called the stratum corneum, protects the body from 
the environment and consists of hard, flattened dead cells. In a process
called exfoliation, your skin cells shed, at a rate of about 30,000 per
minute, to reveal the newer cells that are produced in the bottom layers
of the epidermis and pushed up through the middle layers until they
94
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

reach the stratus corneum. Over a two to four week period, new cells
die, shed, and are replaced by newer cells.
Beneath the stratum corneum, the remaining layers consist mostly of two
types of cells: squamous cells and basal cells. Squamous cells produce
keratin, a protein that makes up a large part of skin, hair, and nails. Basal
cells are found in the bottom layer of the epidermis, where new cells are
continually produced. Both squamous cells and basal cells can become
cancerous; most skin cancers, 70 to 80 percent, arise in basal cells.
Melanocytes are cells that produce skin pigment, or melanin. These cells
can also become cancerous.
The skin on your eyelids is only 0.05 millimeters (mm) thick; on your
palms and the soles of your feet, it’s 1.5 mm thick.
 Dermis: The middle layer, the dermis, is the thickest, making up about 90
percent of your skin. The main role of the dermis is to regulate tempera-
ture and supply the epidermis with nutrient-rich blood. The dermis con-
tains nerve fibers, fat cells, blood vessels, sweat and oil glands, and hair
follicles. Sweat glands keep you from becoming overheated and help keep
you at a constant 98.6 degrees (although everyone’s internal temperature
is a little different). The dermis also contains collagen and elastin, two
proteins responsible for the structure and elasticity of the skin.
• Collagen: Between 75 and 80 percent of your skin is made up of 
collagen, a protein manufactured in the dermis by cells called fibrob-
lasts. Collagen is one of the strongest proteins in your body, and it
gives skin its strength and durability.
• Elastin: Another protein manufactured in the dermis, elastin gives
skin its elasticity, allowing it to stretch out and then bounce back
in shape.
 Subcutaneous: This layer is composed primarily of subcutaneous fat and
connective tissue. A certain number of fat cells are essential; they provide
energy, serve as heat insulators for the body, and act as a shock absorber
to protect underlying tissue and organs from injury. However, too much
subcutaneous fat, or adipose fat, makes you — well, fat! Sweat glands orig-
inate in this layer and excrete waste matter through perspiration.
Although normal skin cells rejuvenate constantly, you can’t actually grow
new skin over a large cut or injury like you can grow new bone when you
break one (refer to Chapter 7 for more info on bone growth). A large cut or
skin injury is covered with scar tissue instead of normal skin. Scar tissue,
made up mostly of fibrous tissue, grows in an area where the underlying
layers of the skin have been damaged or destroyed and can no longer per-
form their normal functions. Your body compensates by creating new tissue,
which, while strong and durable, doesn’t contain the blood vessels, glands,
hair follicles, or nerve endings of the original skin.

Chapter 5: Loving the Skin You're In

How skin ages
Your skin is as subject to aging as any other organ in your body. If you’ve put
extra stress on your skin — by spending too much time in the sun, smoking,
yo-yo dieting, or eating poorly — the natural effects of aging are magnified.
When you’re young, your skin’s turnover rate is about every 15 to 18 days,
which is why you have that youthful glow — a new layer of cells appears
every few weeks. When you start approaching your mid-30s, the cell turnover
process slows down to about every month. By age 70, the cell regeneration
rate can be as long as several months.
Skin is damaged in two ways — by intrinsic factors and by extrinsic factors.
Intrinsic factors are directly related to aging; an example is a slowdown in 
cell regeneration. Extrinsic factors are outside factors, like sun and pollutant
exposure. According to the National Institute of Health, 90 percent of visible
skin damage is from ultra-violet sources. That means that a great deal of the
damage done to your skin may be preventable, or at least modifiable. The
younger you start, the better!
Looking at intrinsic (age-related) aging factors
Because everyone inherits different genetic characteristics, keeping skin
lovely as you age is, in part, a matter of inheriting good genes. For most
people, though, the same intrinsic changes occur over the years. All these
changes working together add up to wrinkles, fine lines, sagging skin, dry
skin, flaky skin, and easily damaged skin. Here’s what happens:
 The epidermis layer of the skin becomes thinner.
 Cell turnover slows.
 Collagen begins to break down, the subcutaneous layer thins, and the
skin’s elastin is less able to “spring back” (think of an overstretched
rubber band). The results are wrinkles and saggy, baggy skin.
 Oil production from the sebaceous glands decreases.
 Melanin production slows, increasing your susceptibility to sun damage
and also causing you to appear paler.
 Pores enlarge and become clogged.
 Capillaries and broken blood vessels become more visible, as well as
more frequent, due to the fragility of the blood vessels as you age.
Intrinsic effects don’t occur in a vacuum; they’re affected for better or worse
throughout your life by extrinsic effects. The skin damage you see as you age
isn’t a result of just one factor, but a number of factors working together to
produce the results you’d rather not see in the mirror.
96
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

Examining extrinsic aging factors
You can’t control what type of skin you inherit, but you can control the
damage you inflict on your skin yourself. Extrinsic factors are factors not
related to normal aging or genetics; effects from sun, smoking, and pollution
are all examples of extrinsic damage. The extrinsic factor that causes the
most skin damage over the years is — you guessed it — sun exposure. But
any or all of these factors contribute to premature aging of your skin:
 Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun damage the DNA in epidermal cells,
often resulting in mutations that can cause cancer.
 UV radiation accelerates the breakdown of collagen in the dermis.
 UV radiation increases the accumulation of abnormal elastin, which
leads to increased wrinkling.
 Cigarette smoke constricts blood vessels in the skin and reduces the
amount of oxygen and nutrients that reach facial tissues, resulting in
increased wrinkling and loss of elasticity.
Fleeing the Free Radicals: Recognizing
and Preventing Extrinsic Skin Damage
Free radicals are a hot topic these days, and although they sound like an alter-
native rock group, free radicals are actually a complicated molecular phenom-
enon. Free radicals are the result of unpaired electrons; electrons don’t like to
be alone, so they look to correct this imbalance. Free radicals try to take an
electron from some other cell to pair up with, leaving the donor cell missing
part of its structure.
The effect of free radical molecules on skin — taking electrons from healthy
cells and leaving the donor cell dysfunctional in the process — creates visible
damage (think wrinkles, thinning skin, and diminished muscles) and advances
the aging process. The sun, pollution, smoking, alcohol, poor nutrition, and
harsh skin products can all damage the skin at the cellular level by increasing
free radical formation.
We start with the most damaging skin toxin — the sun’s powerful damaging
rays — and then we look at a few of the other free-radical-forming skin irri-
tants, the way they damage the skin, and some ways that you may be able to
protect against them.
Unfortunately, extrinsic factors can’t be avoided entirely, and intrinsic factors
can’t be avoided at all. Both, however, can be modified or reduced. In the next
sections, we describe the most common causes of skin damage and what you
can do to minimize their effects.
97
Chapter 5: Loving the Skin You're In

The scorching sun: Putting a block
between you and the rays
The number one cause of wrinkles is sun damage — not old age. No matter
what your age, lifestyle, or geographic location, your skin is exposed to the
sun’s ultraviolet rays (UVA and UVB radiation), which can cause irreversible
damage to your skin by decreasing its ability to synthesize (manufacture) 
collagen and elastin. Sun damage can result from long-term or cumulative
exposure over the years, or it can show up years after severe sunburn. Sun
damage can cause the following:
 Worsening wrinkles
 Tough, leathery, wrinkled, blotchy skin
 Precancerous growths called actinic keratoses, which are dark, flaky,
hardened areas of skin
 Basal or squamous cell carcinoma (in layman’s terms, skin cancer)
 Melanoma, a form of skin cancer that can show up years after severe
sunburn
Sun exposure is one of the easiest skin damages to avoid, if you’re willing to
take a few extra minutes every day to slather on some sunscreen. This may
seem foreign to you if you spent the first 20 years of your life slathering on
baby oil to perfect your tan! But, as people become more conscious of protect-
ing their skin from sun damage, you see a shift from the deep tan look to the
smooth, creamy skin look. Some of the new sunscreen products are spray-on
lotions that are easier to apply and reduce missed spots. A couple of minutes is
all you need to get a thorough application — and the result can be life saving.
UV rays aren’t all equal; different types have different effects. To oversimplify
a bit, UVA rays = aging changes; UVB rays = sunburn. Sun Protection Factor
(or SPF; see the nearby sidebar “Conundrum! Choosing a sunscreen” for more
info) measures your degree of protection only against the sun’s burning UVB
rays. So, what about the most harmful UVA rays? Good question. If your sun-
screen provides only UVB protection and you stay in the sun for three and a
half hours, you expose your unprotected skin to the most damaging of the
sun’s rays and don’t even feel it. After all, UVA rays don’t burn you. They do,
however, damage your skin.
UVA rays aren’t blocked by glass, like UVB rays are, so you can acquire skin
damage by riding in the car or sitting in a bright sunny window. Having your
windows tinted with a UVA blocking tint can prevent this damage; consider
having your windows tinted especially if you have very sensitive skin or live
in an area where the sun rays are stronger. Check out Table 5-1 for additional
comparisons of UVA and UVB rays.

Protecting your skin from damaging UV radiation is possible; we recommend
the following tactics to keep the sun’s damage to a minimum:
 Make sure that your sunscreen is effective against both UVA and 
UVB rays.
 Apply a liberal amount of a double-duty sunscreen with SPF 15 daily; 
low dose daily sunscreen is more effective in preventing damage than
occasional use of a higher SPF.
 Look for makeup that has sunscreen in it so that when you put on your
face, you also apply your daily dose of sunscreen on your most delicate
area.
 Completely cover your skin with a thin layer of sunscreen; most people
don’t put enough on.
 Don’t wait until the last minute; sunscreen takes 20 to 30 minutes to
soak into the skin to be effective, so don’t just slap your sunscreen on
right before you head out the door.
 If you use topical retinoid products on your skin for exfoliation or any
other reason, you’re more likely to have sun damage, due to the loss of
some of your body’s first layer of defense. Use a higher SPF and apply
diligently.
 If you’re going to have continual sun exposure, reapply sunscreen 30
minutes after exposure begins and then every 2 to 3 hours, and after
activities that may wash away the coverage (swimming and sweating).
 Don’t be afraid to wear a hat. Many hats are very effective at blocking
sun from the head and face.
If bugs bother you and you use sunscreen and insect repellent together, 
use a higher SPF sunscreen. Insect repellent decreases the effectiveness of
sunscreen by one third.
99
Chapter 5: Loving the Skin You're In

Sunscreen ingredients (17 are approved for use in sunscreen) fall into one 
of two categories: absorbers and blockers, also called reflectors. Absorbing
ingredients absorb UV rays before they can penetrate your skin, and blockers
are physical barriers to absorption. Octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) or oxy-
benzone are examples of chemicals in sunscreens that absorb UV rays. Zinc,
a thick white paste, is an example of a blocker — remember seeing pictures
of people with white noses at the beach?
Your sunscreen should contain both blockers and absorbers, and should
include ingredients that block UVA rays as well as UVB.
For UVA protection, your sunscreen label should list one of the following
active ingredients:
 Zinc oxide, a blocker
 Titanium dioxide, a blocker
 Avobenzone or butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (Parsol 1789, Eusolex
9020, Escalol 517, and others), which block both UVA and UVB
 Ecamsule (Mexoryl), which absorbs UVA rays

Conundrum! Choosing a sunscreen
As you look at the array of sunscreens available,
you may be unsure of whether to buy one with a
15, 30, or even 50 Sun Protection Factor (SPF).
According to the Federal Drug Administration, a
product’s SPF number tells you how long you can
stay in the sun before getting burned. An SPF 15
product lets you stay in the sun 15 times longer
than you would normally be able to without get-
ting burned. If you normally stay in the sun for 15
minutes before you start turning pink, use an SPF
15 to get 225 minutes (15 × 15), or approximately 3
and a half hours of sun exposure before you start
burning. If you begin turning pink after 10 minutes,
an SPF 15 lets you stay in the sun approximately 2
and a half hours, or 10 minutes times 15.
In addition to telling you how much longer you
can stay outside, the following SPFs block a
certain percentage of the sun’s UVB rays:
 SPF 2 blocks about 50 percent of UVB rays
 SPF 10 blocks about 85 percent of UVB rays
 SPF 15 blocks about 95 percent of UVB rays
 SPF 30 blocks about 97 percent of UVB rays
Note: An SPF over 30 doesn’t increase the
amount of blockage; it just increases the
length of time you can stay in the sun with-
out burning
Consider the UV index (strength of the sun’s
ultraviolet rays), skin type, how frequently
you’re reapplying, and whether you’re in water
when choosing a proper SPF. All these factors
may make a higher SPF more appropriate for
you. Visit www.webMD.com and www.
americancancersociety.com for infor-
mation on choosing and applying sunscreens.

We highly recommend applying and reapplying sunscreen, but we know that it
isn’t always easy or convenient. Take these additional preventative measures
to protect your skin against the damaging effects of the sun’s radiation:
 Remember that sun exposure is more intense at higher altitudes and close
to the equator; in both cases the sun’s rays have to travel less distance
through the atmosphere. For every 1,000 feet you rise in altitude, your sun
exposure increases 2 percent. Grass, sand, snow, ice, and water all increase
sun exposure as well, as much as 20 to 30 percent in the case of sand.
 Avoid sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.
 Wear protective clothing and a wide-brimmed hat when you’re outside
(UVA rays are present even on cloudy days).
Toxic smoke (that is, all smoke): 
Snuffing out its effects
Smoking damages skin by releasing free radicals and also by the repetitive
muscle contractions that accompany each puff. Secondhand smoke can be a
culprit, too, because it stirs up free radicals. Free radicals initiated by smok-
ing reduce the delivery of needed oxygen and nutrients by their effects on
the blood vessels. The smoke also increases certain proteins that break down
collagen. Collagen is already decreasing with age, so speeding up this process
isn’t doing your skin any favors.

Scary skin stats
Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in
the United States. Does that surprise you? Here’s
even more startling news:
 Globally between 2 and 3 million non-melanoma
skin cancers and 132,000 melanoma skin can-
cers occur each year.
 According to the American Cancer Society,
about 7,800 adults in the U.S. die of skin cancer
each year.
 Melanoma, the most serious form of skin
cancer, can spread to other parts of the body
quickly.
 Melanoma is the leading cause of cancer
death among women ages 25 to 29.
 Melanoma is second only to lung cancer as
the leading cause of cancer in women ages
30 to 34.
The good news, though, is that you can largely
prevent skin cancer by practicing consistent
skincare protection from UV ray exposure (see
the nearby section “The scorching sun: Putting
a block between you and the rays” for more on
this topic).

Cellular damage from free radicals isn’t the only problem you can pin on smoke.
It also leaves a nasty residue on the surface of your skin, much like the stains on
a smoker’s fingertips or the grime on the walls of a smoky bar. You’ve likely seen
the classic “smoker’s face,” identified by the number of wrinkles all around the
mouth from drawing in on a cigarette, and lines around the eyes from squinting
through smoke irritation.
Obviously the way to prevent or reverse the skin damage that smoking causes
is to stop smoking. If you quit smoking, but wrinkles and skin damage from
past smoking have already occurred, the following tips help reduce already
present wrinkles:
 Exercise to increase oxygen to the skin thereby increasing blood flow.
 Drink plenty of water to improve skin integrity (smoking can dehydrate
the skin).
 Take extra vitamin A and vitamin C to help overcome previous damage.
These vitamins help protect the skin, but they aren’t well absorbed in
smokers.
Aggressive skin treatments, such as chemical peels and laser resurfacing, can
be costly and often are only temporary. Botox can help paralyze the muscles
that cause the wrinkling around the mouth and eyes, and cosmetic fillers can
fill the fine crevices in the skin for a better cosmetic appearance.
Other ways to fight for your skin
If you don’t smoke, and if you do protect your skin from the sun, you’re off to
a great start at protecting your skin. Unfortunately, a few other elements can
have damaging effects to the skin. These problems aren’t hard to avoid if you
remember a few important points:
 Fight free radicals with good nutrition. A good diet, high in antioxi-
dants, can help fight damage from free radicals. Antioxidants can bind
with free radicals to stop their damaging effects.
Foods high in antioxidants aren’t difficult to find; food high in beta
carotene, selenium, vitamins C and E, and zinc all fall into the category
of antioxidants. (We talk in detail about nutrition and the benefits of
antioxidants in Chapter 7, but a diet high in green and yellow vegetables,
fruits, fish oils, eggs, legumes, and whole grains will help you fight off
the free radicals.)
 Modify your alcohol intake. Light alcohol intake has some beneficial
aspects, particularly in regard to cholesterol levels and the heart. The
problem is that drinking too much alcohol puts your entire detox system
into overdrive because the liver and kidneys have to filter out a huge
amount of additional toxins, and so does your skin (remember, that’s
102
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

one of its jobs). Alcohol also depletes your body of nutrients for healthy
hair and skin and accelerates the aging process in your skin (as well as
other organs). Specifically, it depletes your body of vitamin A, a very
important antioxidant. Drinking alcohol in excess also leads to a nutri-
tion deficiency of vitamin B complex, a vital group of nutrients that can
fight against skin damage, as well as diarrhea and depression.
To minimize the damage from alcohol, limit the amount of alcoholic
drinks to no more than one to two per day for men and no more than
one per day for women.
 Decrease your pollution exposure. Pollution is so prevalent that you
can’t completely avoid it; car exhaust, chemically infested water, and
toxic air have you covered. It’s in your hair, on your skin, in your nose,
under your nails, and between your toes. You ingest it when you eat your
food and drink your water (even bottled!). Pollution doesn’t allow your
skin to breathe and function properly, so it promotes and accelerates the
aging process.
To combat the effects of pollution, we recommend that you stick to a
daily cleansing routine to get rid of as much toxic buildup as possible
(see the later section “Aging Beautifully: A How-To Guide for Interested
Folks” for specifics) and be sure to eat foods rich in antioxidants and
keep your body hydrated.
 Avoid harsh weather conditions and other things that strip moisture
from your skin; on the contrary, make sure you stay well hydrated.
Dry skin is a nearly universal problem, but certain factors make you
more likely to develop tightness, flakiness, and fine lines. These factors
include
• Your age: Skin tends to become drier as you age because your oil-
producing glands become less active. The lack of oil also causes
cells to clump together in flakes or scales. At the same time, the
skin-cell regeneration process slows down, and the skin’s ability to
hold on to moisture diminishes. Your complexion can appear rough
and dull.
• Your gender: Everyone’s skin changes with age. Women usually
experience an increase in dry skin during and after menopause.
Men have minimal changes in the moisture of their skin as they
age, unless of course they have other damaging risk factors such
as smoking.
Extreme weather conditions like temperature and moisture level
extremes, biting wind, and stinging cold all wreak havoc on your skin. 
In the winter, your skin may become dry, red, and flaky. In the summer, 
it may be sweaty, burned, and oily. Even though your skin is designed to
handle just about anything you throw its way, it still needs time to adjust
to these changes. The increased cold or dryness actually affects your 
skin most when it first occurs; after a few months, your skin has adjusted
to the change.
103
Chapter 5: Loving the Skin You're In

You can control some things. The following activities affect your skin:
• Central air and heating, wood-burning stoves, space heaters, and
fireplaces all reduce humidity and dry your skin in the winter
months. (And if you live in an older home that has radiator heat-
ing, your cells are even more parched.) 
• Frequent showering or bathing, especially if you like hot water and
long baths, can break down the lipid barriers in your skin. 
• Frequent swimming, particularly in heavily chlorinated pools can
have the same effect. 
• If you’re subject to dry skin, limit activities that involve submer-
sion of your skin in water for long periods of time. Some people
with severe dry skin may need to consider taking only showers —
and not every day. You may be able to enjoy the water if you can
find a good moisturizer. 
If you have dry skin, dry off quickly after getting out of the water,
and quickly apply a moisturizing lotion. This combination often
manages dry skin and can give you more freedom to partake in a
nice warm bath from time to time.
Because you can’t change the weather, you should provide your skin
with some protection from the harsh effects and subsequent reactions.
Prepare and protect your skin from moisture loss by using moisturizers,
covering your face in harsh wind and cold, and shielding your face with
a hat in excessively dry climates.
Recognizing and Managing 
Skin-Damaging Diseases
Many diseases are directly reflected in your skin. Some diseases primarily
target the skin, like rosacea; others (like systemic lupus erythematosus, or
SLE) are systemic (affecting your whole body) diseases that can target several
organs, but often have the presence of skin manifestations.
Many of the following conditions are quite common; psoriasis alone is esti-
mated to affect 125 million people worldwide. We start with the conditions that
predominantly affect the skin first and finish with the ones that are systemic:
 Eczema: Eczema is dry skin; the problem with dry skin is that it becomes
more susceptible to bacterial, fungal, and viral infections that cause the
manifestations called “eczema.” Moisturizers, gentle cleaners, and topical
104
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

steroids for flare-ups can help control eczema, which can be found on any
part of the skin.
 Rosacea: Rosacea is a skin disease characterized by enlarged blood 
vessels resulting in red, bumpy, blotchy skin. The cause is unknown, but
the effects are quite visible. Found initially on the face, rosacea may be
dismissed as merely adult “pimples” when it first appears. In addition to
affecting the skin, rosacea can cause your eyes to become dry, red, and
irritated. Antibiotic creams can help keep rosacea under control. Using
sunscreen regularly and keeping a list of what seems to trigger flare-ups
can also help.
 Psoriasis: This autoimmune disease is marked by a rapid buildup of
rough, dry, dead skin cells that form thick scales. Skin cells in psoriasis
are replaced every few days rather than every few weeks, resulting in
patches called plaques. Cold, dry weather, stress, skin abrasions, and
injuries can cause flare-ups.
This is another disease that affects the skin but can affect other body
systems as well. Psoriatic arthritis (joint inflammation) affects between
10 and 30 percent of psoriasis cases. The treatment for mild cases
includes using a topical salicylic acid (aspirin), vitamin D3, or steroid
cream. Severe cases, whether they affect skin only or a combination of
skin and joint involvement, may need systemic medications such as
steroids, methotrexate, remicade, and enbrel. Another option for severe
skin disease is using a UVB light source regularly for a set time. You can
purchase home units that provide excellent results. Some of the medica-
tions for psoriasis are very strong and can have serious side effects, so
discuss treatment options with your doctor.
 SLE: SLE is a systemic disease that affects nearly every organ in the body,
including your skin. SLE may first come to your attention because of the
characteristic “lupus rash,” which goes across the cheeks (the wings) 
and bridge of the nose (the body), resembling a butterfly. SLE may require
systemic treatment with steroids to decrease flare-ups — if you think you
may have it, consult your doctor for evaluation and you may be referred
to a rheumatologist or dermatologist for further care.
 Hypothyroidism: This condition occurs when your thyroid produces
too little thyroid hormones. It reduces the activity of your sweat and oil
glands, leading to swollen, dry, waxy skin. Some people may have a yel-
lowish color to the skin due to poor vitamin A absorption and can often
suffer from hair loss. This condition can be diagnosed with blood tests,
but may need further evaluation of the thyroid gland itself if the gland is
enlarged. Thyroid disease can be treated with thyroid hormone replace-
ment and is easy to control with proper monitoring. Your primary care
doctor or an endocrinologist will direct your management.
105

Inspecting Your Skin for Cancer
In addition to prevention, assess your skin monthly for strange looking spots
or textures. Once a month, check your whole body. Don’t limit this check to
the obvious places that you can easily see — you also need to check places
like your back, scalp, and the bottoms of your feet. Ask a loved one to help
you, or use a hand mirror to check the places yourself. Women often find
melanoma on their legs, an area that many people don’t think to check. Men
frequently find melanoma on the trunk of the body. But melanoma can strike
anywhere, so make sure that you do a thorough check.
Closely examine your moles during these monthly checks. Your moles are
good indicators of change and can be early warning signs of skin cancer. Use
the ABCDE rule to evaluate moles; look for the following signs:
 A for asymmetry: A mole that doesn’t look the same on the left and
right or on the top and bottom
 B for border: A mole with edges or a border that’s blurry or jagged
 C for color: A mole that darkens or loses color, or whose color spreads
or otherwise changes. Look for the appearance of multiple colors like
blue, red, white, pink, purple, or gray
 D for diameter: A mole larger than 1⁄4 inch in diameter (about the size 
of a pencil eraser)
 E for elevation: A mole that’s raised above the skin and has a rough 
surface
In addition the ABCDE test, watch for the following changes in moles:
 A mole that bleeds
 A mole that grows quickly with notable changes within a few weeks to 
6 months
 A mole that itches
Moles aren’t the only type of lesion that can be cancerous; just watching your
moles may mean missing another type of skin cancer. Basal cell and squamous
cell cancers don’t grow as quickly as melanomas, so you may not notice their
growth unless you’re doing a systematic monthly skin check. Look for the 
following:
 A scaly or crusted growth on the skin that isn’t the result of your latest
rollerblading stunt
 A sore that doesn’t heal
 A place on your skin that feels rough, like sandpaper
106
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the changes in this 
section or find that a lesion fits any of the descriptors in the ABCDE. Early
diagnosis and treatment of cancer is extremely important.
Aging Beautifully: A How-To 
Guide for Interested Folks
Although preventing skin damage is extremely important as you age, you may
be interested in going a step further — not only preventing damage but also
pampering your skin. Aren’t you worth it? Sure you are! Men, don’t think that
this section doesn’t apply to you; great looking skin is for everyone!
Maintaining a healthy cleansing regimen
Skin-care people tend to fall into a few different categories — the “buy every
product on the market” group, the “I never touch the stuff” group, and the 
vast majority group — the group that buys products and forgets to use them.
Certainly, you can find an incredible number of promising skin-care products —
maybe too many, if you unknowingly use everything you can to clog your
pores, age your face, and eventually require a putty knife and a bottle of vodka
to remove it all. But the best place to start good skin care is with a regular,
complete cleansing routine.
Wash your face twice a day; once in the morning and again at night before
bed. When you do, follow these steps:
1. Cleanse your skin.
Choose a gentle cleanser that leaves your skin feeling clean, not tight
and dry. It should be close to your skin’s pH, which is slightly acidic,
around 4.5 to 5.5, with some alpha and beta hydroxies to open pores,
dissolve oil, and slough off some dead skin.
Facial cleanser doesn’t have to be expensive to be good and effective, 
so keep it simple. This is one area where you can skip the high price name
brands for a cheaper brand. It isn’t on your skin long; save your money for
your moisturizer. Skip the fancy fragrance, harsh detergents (they can irri-
tate your skin), and soap — especially the same soap you use on the rest
of your body. Soap can dry your skin, and can irritate it if too alkaline;
most bar soaps have a pH around 9 (a pH of 7 is neutral; a lower number
is acidic, a higher number alkaline).
Don’t go to bed with makeup on your face. That residue clogs your
pores and doesn’t allow dead skin cells to be shed. In addition, your skin
can’t regulate its temperature, breathe properly, or release toxins.
107
Chapter 5: Loving the Skin You're In

2. Use a toner to remove excess dirt and oil.
Do you really need a toner? It depends on who you ask (even beauty
experts don’t always agree), what type of skin you have, and the type of
toner you choose. Even a good cleanser doesn’t remove all the dirt and
oil from your skin, so a toner wipes up what a cleanser leaves behind.
Toner also tightens pores, hydrates your skin, restores proper pH, and
increases circulation. However, toners that contain alcohol can dry skin
excessively.
Choose a non-alcohol based astringent (alcohol can irritate your skin).
Most toners indicate whether they’re for oily, dry, or even acne-prone
skin; read labels before buying the product nearest you on the shelf!
Toners, like cleansers, don’t need to be expensive. The ingredients in
toners are inexpensive, so you may be paying a high price for a pretty
label or a brand name.
3. Exfoliate to stimulate cell turnover.
To exfoliate doesn’t mean to rub your face with stones or wire brushes
until the skin’s raw. It simply means to remove dead skin cells, and many
dermatologists believe that it would be hard to over-exfoliate. Exfoliating
that outer layer helps nutrients in the topical products you apply
(serums and moisturizers) to get down to the live skin cells. This step
also opens up clogged pores, keeping under-the-skin bumps and black-
heads from becoming a nuisance. Exfoliating needs to be done only a
few times a week.
A quality exfoliating product is essential. Unfortunately, the labels and
claims for exfoliating products can be a bit confusing, with many prod-
ucts over-promising and under-delivering. See the “Distinguishing
between promising products and bogus beauty claims” sidebar later in
this chapter for guidance.
Choose an exfoliant for faces only if you’re exfoliating your face. Select
other exfoliating products for other parts of your body that get rough
and dry (feet, hands, and elbows). Follow these guidelines:
• A good daily facial exfoliant has an 8- to 10-percent-strength gly-
colic acid pad to slough off dead skin cells. (Any weaker strength
can’t achieve exfoliating results.)
• Using Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) and Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA)
facial peels a couple times a week is a fantastic way to exfoliate
without overdoing it. But unless you have free access to an estheti-
cian (a qualified skin care specialist), you may be spending more
on your face than you bargained for.
• Weekly microdermabrasion (an exfoliation treatment where the skin
is “sandblasted” to remove dead skin cells) scrubs with very fine
granules are magnificent but pricey. Over-the-counter microder-
mabrasion creams are good once a week to polish your face.
108
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

The best judge of whether the product is working or not is your own
reflection in the mirror. Is your skin softer, less blotchy, free of acne?
Sounds like you’ve found the right combination of skin-care products!
Want to make sure you keep getting good results? Write down products
that really work well for you so that you remember them the next time
you’re at the store.
4. Moisturize to keep your skin supple.
Your skin is coated with sebum, a natural moisturizing oil that you
shower away with harsh soaps and expose to environmental assaults.
Sebum also rubs off on your clothes and wipes off when you sweat. So
whether you live in Arizona, Idaho, or the near the Tropic of Cancer;
whether you have oily skin, dry skin, or a combination; whether you’re 
a man or woman; you still need a moisturizer to
• Help replenish your skin with the vital nutrients and hydration it
needs to stay healthy
• Replace oils and nutrients you strip away during cleansing
• Help minimize the appearance of fine lines
Invest in a quality product. Just make sure that you’re paying for the
quality and not just the label. Look for these ingredients:
• Oil-free for oily skin and cream for normal to dry skin
• An SPF of 30 (If you don’t want a product that includes an SPF, be
sure that you also apply a broad spectrum sunscreen; see the ear-
lier section, “The scorching sun: Putting a block between you and
the rays,” for more on SPF.)
Skip the mineral oil because it can clog pores and trap perspiration. It
doesn’t get absorbed into the skin because the molecules it contains are
too big.
Apply moisturizer twice a day after cleaning, toning, or exfoliating.
Keeping your skin well hydrated
Keeping the skin moist from the inside out is important regardless of your
age or gender, because dry skin looks flaky and dull and feels itchy. The
stores contain a plethora of moisturizing creams, liquids, and lotions. Don’t
forget that you have skin that could use moisturizing in places besides your
face! Moisturize your legs and other potentially dry areas, like elbows and
knees. Moisturizing products come in several types:
 Oil-based creams: These creams retain moisture and serve as a barrier by
blocking the release of water from the skin. As you age, oil-based creams
aren’t very effective because your skin loses its ability to attract moisture
109
Chapter 5: Loving the Skin You're In

in the first place. Oil-based creams can retain moisture only if your skin
has moisture to begin with. Oil-based creams may work for some dry skin.
 Water-based lotions: A good remedy for aging skin is a natural moistur-
izer that attracts and retains water. Water-based lotions are also a good
choice if you have oily skin.
 Gels: More solid than creams, gels are good for oily faces.
Toning muscles for a face-lifting effect
Remember Mom telling you that if you made funny faces, your face would
freeze that way? Actually, the opposite may be true; not working your facial
muscles and exercising them regularly can result in wrinkles, lines, and fur-
rows that can become permanent.
Exercise is good for you — all of you! Exercising the muscles in your face and
neck can help keep the skin firm and relax muscles you may tense without
even realizing it. The good thing about face and neck exercises is that you
can do them anytime and anywhere — in the car, right before you go to sleep,
or to scare off strangers on the street!
Neck and throat
If you want to firm up or avoid saggy skin, double chins, and loose skin on
your neck, these quick exercises can help:
1. Sit up straight, tilt your head back to look at the ceiling, and keep
your lips closed.
2. Start a chewing movement.
Repeat 20 times.
3. Gently turn your head to the right for 20 big chews, and then turn to
the left for 20 big chews.
4. Look at the ceiling, and pucker up.
That’s right — try to kiss the ceiling. Stretch and hold your kiss for ten
counts and then relax.
Repeat this step five times. You should really feel the stretch in your
neck and under your chin.
5. Sit in your chair, look up at the ceiling, tilt your head back, and open
your lips.
6. Stick out your tongue and try to touch your chin; try to keep your
tongue in this position for ten counts.
7. Relax and tuck your tongue back in your mouth where it belongs.
Repeat Steps 5 to 7 ten times.

Essentials to look for in skin-care products
The number of skin-care ingredients on the market
are virtually as limitless as a chemist’s imagination.
But you don’t have to be a chemist to figure out what
to use on your face; this list includes the most essen-
tial skin-care ingredients, many of which can limit or
reverse the effects of aging or damage to skin:
 Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA): This ingredient has
been around since the 1980s as a chemical
peel to exfoliate dead skin cells and give a
noticeable improvement to the skin’s appear-
ance. Benefits include the disappearance of
fine lines and wrinkles, and a fresher looking
skin tone. Hydroxies also act as a stimulator of
collagen production and cell growth.
The percentage of AHA concentration depends
on where you get it and who applies it. You can
apply over-the-counter AHAs, which have gly-
colic acid in a solution up to 10 percent. An
esthetician or licensed cosmetologist can use
up to 30 percent AHA; these facial peels are sim-
ilar to microdermabrasion, and erase fine lines
and smooth the skin’s texture. Finally, a derma-
tologist can use a 50- to 70-percent AHA solu-
tion; after you get past the pain, redness, and
oozing for up to four weeks, your results can last
two to five years.
 Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA): This ingredient,
commonly known as salicylic acid, is also an
exfoliant. It’s oil-based, while AHA is water-
based. As a result, BHAs are better at pene-
trating and unclogging pores where those
nasty little blackheads and whiteheads get
stuck. Most products geared toward oily or
acne-prone skin contain this product.
 Alpha-Lipoic Acid: This acid is an antioxidant
with many skin-rejuvenating benefits, includ-
ing an inhibiting effect on wrinkles. Lipoic acid
also has moderate anti-inflammatory benefits
(thus reducing inflammation that can cause
red, blotchy skin) and is capable of removing
several toxic metals from the body.
 Dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE): One of the
major skin problems of advanced aging is loss
of elasticity due to the tissue destruction of
collagen and elastin. DMAE is a topical agent
that functions as a cell-membrane stabilizer to
produce a firming effect on the skin.
 Vitamin A (tretinoin): This vitamin switches on
receptors that tell the skin to grow new cells, syn-
thesize elastin and collagen, and produce sebum.
Indirectly, it stops the enzyme that breaks down
collagen and elastin. As your skin ages, this
breakdown process speeds up.
Research confirms that tretinoin reduces fine
wrinkles and skin roughness, increases middle-
layer skin thickness, and stimulates collagen
production. Retin-A, developed to treat acne, is
the most recognizable form of tretinoin. It’s avail-
able by prescription only.
 Vitamin C: This is one of the most widely used
ingredients in skin-care products for wrinkle
reduction and skin rejuvenation. Vitamin C is
also essential for collagen synthesis, and it
contains antioxidant properties that help fight
free-radical damage. Vitamin C undergoes oxi-
dation when exposed to air and can lose its
effectiveness. New derivatives of vitamin C
that are more stable and less likely to break
down upon exposure to air are being devel-
oped. Look for a colorless product with a 10-
percent concentration of vitamin C.

Lips and cheeks
Do these exercise steps to help erase lip lines and to prevent saggy cheeks:
1. Sit comfortably, close your lips, and keep your teeth together.
2. Smile as wide as you can without opening your lips.
Hold for five seconds.

Distinguishing between promising 
products and bogus beauty claims
You’ve seen all the brightly colored bottles and
packages of skin-care products, watched
infomercials with celebrities, and seen the ads
with models who have ravishing bodies and pris-
tine skin — all flaunting the latest breakthroughs
in skin-care technology. Everything looks so
promising, so you keep pulling out your wallet
faster than they can take your money. You try the
products again and again — but the results are
disappointing. Another $120 for 1 ounce of snake
oil down the toilet.
So are any of these products for real? How can
those companies make those claims if they aren’t
true? Both valid questions. The short answer to
the first one is, “Yes, many products are real and
do provide real benefits to your skin.” The short
answer to the second question has to do with
regulations in the cosmetics industry.
Just like labels on food, household cleaners, and
clothing, you need to read the labels on skin-care
products. The labels list ingredients by their chem-
ical or scientific name from highest to lowest con-
tent. (Most people aren’t familiar with these
chemicals, so a copy of a paperback cosmetic-
ingredients dictionary is nice to have. Never heard
of such a book? Type the words “cosmetic ingre-
dients dictionary” into the search engine at
Amazon.com or BarnesandNoble.com
and choose from any one of a dozen options.)
Here’s the tricky part. Say you want to buy a face-
firming cream with DMAE because you’ve heard
that it’s great for firming skin. Great choice! The
department store has two choices — both with
DMAE and both promising to firm your skin — but
one is twice as expensive. Which one do you buy?
Of course, the one that contains the highest,
safest, and most effective amount of the active
ingredient DMAE. But the label doesn’t tell you
that (and the clerk probably doesn’t know!).
The law (Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act) only
requires the ingredient to be in the product.
Manufacturers don’t have to disclose how much
or at what percentage. So both products can claim
to have the same benefits even if one product has
only a dusting (just a pinch) of DMAE and can’t
begin to deliver on the promise. And yes, it still
costs a premium.
In order to be a smart and knowledgeable con-
sumer, your best bet is to
 Understand the most familiar terms in skin-
care products.
 Check out some of the manufacturers and
their products as well as smaller companies
and doctor brands that disclose this kind of
information on their labels.
Note: Not all companies are bad or out to get you.
Many great products are available from several
companies. But if you rely solely on fancy boxes
and marketing promises for your educational
research, you’ll likely not get what you paid for.

3. Move immediately into a big puckered kiss; hold it for a count of five,
and then relax.
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 ten times.
4. Relax your smile with your lips closed.
5. Suck your cheeks in toward and onto your teeth.
Hold this pose for ten counts, and then relax.
Repeat Steps 4 and 5 ten times.
Eyes and forehead
To decrease frown lines and forehead furrows, and to keep eye crinkle lines
at bay, try these steps:
1. Sit up and look straight ahead with your eyes open.
2. Look up, and then look down, moving just your eyes.
Repeat ten times.
3. Look left, and then look right, moving just your eyes.
Repeat ten times.
4. Make a really big frown.
Try to bring your eyebrows over your eyes while pulling your eyebrows
toward one another.
5. Lift your eyebrows as far as possible while opening your eyes as far as
possible.
Repeat Steps 4 and 5 five times.

one and joint problems, such as arthritis, bum knees, bad hips, back
problems, and brittle bones, used to be philosophically accepted as the
price to be paid for getting older. But today you can find better-than-ever
ways to treat and even prevent some of the problems that result from a life-
time of wear and tear. In this chapter, we give you a primer on bone growth
and aging. We also explain the best ways to preserve your mainframe by
slowing the aging process, and we offer suggestions for dealing with bone
and joint damage that can occur after a lifetime of hard use.
Examining Your Bones’ Biggest Role
If you were asked to associate one word with the word bone, you may choose
“calcium.” Your bones contain 99 percent of the calcium in your body, and you
have more of this mineral in your body than any other. Calcium together with
phosphorus is responsible for the strength of your bones and teeth. Calcium
and phosphorus keep your bones strong; their levels are kept in a constant 
balance in your body. As blood calcium levels increase, phosphorus levels
decrease. Maintaining constant concentrations of calcium and phosphorus in
blood requires your body to make frequent adjustments. Your body relies on 
a system of checks and balances, described in the following sections.

Vitally important vitamins and minerals
Almost all of the body’s calcium is stored in the bones (99 percent). Getting
enough calcium in the diet is essential starting at a young age because the
body needs that to help prevent bone loss in the future. Next to calcium,
phosphorus is the must abundant mineral in the body. The problem is that
some minerals need help to maintain a healthy balance in the body and be
available for important functions. Calcium and phosphorus are like stranded
hitchhikers without Vitamin D to help transport them to the bones from the
intestines and also help reabsorb calcium in the kidneys before excretion.
There’s a sensitive balance between phosphorus and calcium and these min-
erals’ teamwork is important in building strong bones and teeth. Take a look
closer at these vitamins and minerals:
 Calcium: Healthy bones need calcium, but calcium is also essential for
other vital functions in your body, like regulating your heartbeat, blood
clotting, muscle contractions, and nerve function. Blood calcium levels
(between 2.2 and 2.6 millimoles per liter or mmol/L) need to remain
stable for your body to work normally; both too much calcium and too
little calcium can be harmful. Too much calcium and too little are
described in the following terms:
• Hypocalcemia: A condition that refers to low levels of blood cal-
cium. Signs of low calcium include involuntary muscle spasms,
muscle cramps, heart irregularities, and stomach cramps and pains.
If you don’t have enough calcium in your blood, your body takes it
from the bones. Calcium taken from your bones has to be replaced
by dietary calcium, found particularly in dairy products, green 
vegetables, and eggs.
• Hypercalcemia: A condition in which you have abnormally high
amounts of calcium in your blood. Too much calcium and phos-
phate in blood and extra cellular fluid can cause widespread organ
dysfunction and damage.

Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 
Two bones in one
Your bones, like your skin, are made up of layers:
 Cortical (compact) bone: Cortical bone forms
the outer layer or protective “shell” of your
bone and accounts for 80 percent of the weight
of the skeleton.
 Trabecular (cancellous) bone: This spongy
part is located inside the bone, where the
bone marrow and blood vessels are. This area
of bone is light and porous and makes up the
remaining 20 percent of the skeleton weight.
All the bones in your body are a combination of
both cortical and trabecular bone. The mix of the
two bone types determines the bone’s strength.

Very large doses (over 2,500 milligrams) of calcium may cause
blood calcium levels to rise and lead to calcium deposits in soft
tissue, such as the heart and kidneys (kidney stones). Large cal-
cium intakes may reduce zinc and iron absorption and impair 
vitamin K metabolism. Very high blood levels of calcium can 
cause heart or lung failure.
 Phosphorus: Phosphorus, like calcium, is also used in other parts of the
body to contract muscles, build and repair bones and teeth, and help
nerves function. Most of your body’s phosphorus (about 85 percent) is
found in your bones. The rest of it is stored in tissues throughout your
body. High dietary sources of phosphate include dairy products, nuts, and
meat. Your kidneys help control the amount of phosphorus in your blood.
Extra phosphorus is filtered by the kidneys and passes out of the body in
the urine. A high level of phosphate in the blood is usually caused by a
kidney problem. The amount of phosphorus in the blood affects the level
of calcium in the blood. The normal level of phosphate in the blood is 0.8
to 1.4 mmol/L.
 Vitamin D: Vitamin D helps you absorb calcium and phosphorus in your
small intestine. A little vitamin D is absorbed from food, but most is made
in the skin, in a process that occurs when your skin is exposed to sunlight.
After that, vitamin D has to be converted to an active form in your kid-
neys. Vitamin D, PTH, and calcitonin (see “Hormones that lend a helping
hand in maintaining calcium balance” later in this chapter) help control
the total amount of calcium in your body. They also regulate the amount
of calcium absorbed from food and the amount removed from your body
by the kidneys.
Organs and hormones that maintain 
the body’s calcium balance
Three parts of the body participate in supplying calcium to blood and remov-
ing it from blood when necessary. These parts don’t make these decisions on
their own, but instead need to be signaled to absorb, excrete, or trigger bone
mineralization or resorption to maintain calcium levels. Those signal callers
are called hormones. Take a closer look at the players in calcium balance:
 Small intestine: The small intestine absorbs dietary calcium in different
places depending on the dietary intake. Active absorption takes place in
the duodenum when dietary calcium is low. Passive (movement across
membranes without using energy) absorption occurs in the jejunum and
the ileum when dietary calcium is higher. The small intestine absorbs
about 40 percent of the total calcium.
 Bone: The bone is the major storage bin of calcium. Calcium and phos-
phate are stored in your bones and can be released from your bones
into your blood as well as deposited back into your bones as needed.
117
Chapter 6: Building Bones and Preserving Joints

 Kidneys: Your kidneys play a vital role in calcium homeostasis (keeping
levels in balance). Normally, almost all the calcium that enters the kidneys
for the formation of urine is reabsorbed back into your blood, which pre-
serves blood calcium at a fairly constant level. However, if blood calcium
levels become too high, the excess calcium is excreted in your urine.
Hormones also play an integral part of bone development, maintenance, and
unfortunately bone destruction. Hormones are the key to controlling the sensi-
tive balance of calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus that your bones need in
order to stay strong and healthy. Some of the major hormones that affect bone
health are as follows:
 Parathyroid hormone (PTH): Parathyroid hormone helps regulate blood
calcium levels. PTH is produced in the parathyroid glands (behind the
thyroid gland in your neck). If your blood calcium levels are too low, the
parathyroid gland releases PTH, which results in bone resorption and the
release of calcium from the bones into the blood. If the calcium level in
the blood rises above normal, PTH secretion falls, and the level of calcium
in the blood falls back to normal. PTH also increases the production of 
vitamin D, which helps increase the absorption of calcium in the small
intestine.
 Calcitonin: This hormone functions to reduce blood calcium levels and
therefore can slow further bone loss. Calcitonin is secreted in response to
hypercalcemia (too much calcium) and increases the excretion of calcium
into urine and the release of calcium from the bone through the inhibition
of bone resorption. Calcitonin can help with some of the pain that can
occur with osteoporosis.
 Estrogen: This hormone inhibits the removal of calcium from the bones
by activity on the osteoblasts (see the previous section). It also helps
keep the osteoblasts alive and active.
 Calcitriol: Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D and is actually a hor-
mone. In response to dropping blood levels of calcium or phosphorus,
calcitriol increases the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the
gastrointestinal tract and increases the bone’s absorption of calcium.
Calcitriol also inhibits the release of PTH.
Zooming in on the bones’ role in 
calcium delivery and balance
Human bones thrive on a personal recycling program called the bone remod-
eling cycle. This cycle of remodeling is a continuous process of removing old
bone and creating new. The bones become lighter, less dense, and more
porous — like a sponge or limestone rock.
Here’s how it works:
118
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

1. The osteoclasts secrete an acid that dissolves enough old bone to
create a tiny cavity.
Osteoclasts are bone cells responsible for demolition; it usually takes
these cells a few weeks to create a tiny cavity.
2. Calcium and other minerals are released from the dissolved bone into
the bloodstream.
When your body needs extra calcium, it signals the osteoclasts to dis-
solve more bone. Most of this material is recycled later in the remodeling
process.
3. Osteoblasts line the cavity that the osteoclasts left with collagen (the
soft, sticky stuff that forms the main frame for bone).
4. The osteoblasts pull in calcium and other minerals (like phosphorus
and magnesium) from the blood, forming crystals on the collagen to
lengthen and thicken the bone.
5. The collagen and minerals harden or calcify into bone tissue.
6. When the osteoblasts are done working, they transform into mature
bone cells, called osteocytes, and become part of the new bone.
The osteocytes no longer participate in bone remodeling, but they do
help maintain the bone and also help balance the calcium and phospho-
rus concentrations.
At the end of the remodeling cycle, the cavity has been refilled with new
bone. The whole process takes three to six months, which explains why
developing osteoporosis can take a long time. This is also why taking early
measures can prevent osteoporosis.
The Big Dilemma: How Your 
Bones Change Over Time
Your bones continue to grow in length and mass from birth until about the
age of 25 to 35 when they hit their peak mass. This age varies from person 
to person and can be influenced by physical activity, gender, and lifestyle
choices. After you reach your peak bone mass, it’s all downhill from there,
though your outer bone can continue to thicken with certain exercises. 
From the climax on, you start to lose bone faster than you can form new
bone. During your younger years, you have excellent bone building ability
and good calcium absorption capacity to build up the bones as much as
possible; then as you age you move to maintain your bone mineral density
through a calcium-rich diet and strength training. You have some control
over how fast and how much bone you lose, so read on for more information
on how and why bone loss occurs and what you can do to slow it down.
119
Chapter 6: Building Bones and Preserving Joints

Decline in calcium absorption
As you move past age 30, your rate of calcium absorption goes down slowly
and steadily until about the age of 50. After 50, bone loss accelerates more
quickly due to the normal decline in hormone levels for men and women and
the onset of menopause for women. Go ahead and add another aging loss to
the list — your hair, your eyesight, your waistline, and now your bone mass.
But, despite the fact that bone loss is another part of the aging process, you
aren’t doomed to the life of a glass menagerie. You do have some control in
delaying the onset. The thicker your bones are, the longer it takes to develop
bone loss.
Calcium absorption slowly decreases from 75 percent in childhood to 25 per-
cent by adulthood and even decreases further as you age. Because calcium
absorption declines with age, dietary needs of calcium are higher for adults
ages 50 and over. Here are some reasons why absorption goes down as age
goes up:
 Vitamin D: As your body ages, skin becomes less effective at making 
vitamin D, which aids in calcium absorption.
 Gastrointestinal changes: As you age, the amount of stomach acid pro-
duction goes down, especially in women. If your stomach isn’t producing
enough stomach acid (hydrochloric acid), the calcium remains in a form
that isn’t readily absorbed by the intestines.
 Medications: Several medications can either reduce calcium absorption
or cause increased calcium loss from bones. Some examples are antacids,
blood pressure medications, cholesterol-lowering medications, thyroid
hormone, certain diuretics, seizure medications, and corticosteroids.
Corticosteroids are great medications for inflammatory conditions such
as asthma and arthritis, but long term steroid use can decrease the forma-
tion of new bone and increase the breakdown of old bone.
 Interfering foods, drinks, and other lifestyle choices: Caffeine can
increase the amount of calcium lost in the urine, as can excess sodium.
Soda has been looked at in several studies as a culprit in disturbing cal-
cium balance. It may be replacing the intake of calcium-rich fluids, and the
phosphorus in the soda interferes with calcium metabolism. Smoking is
associated with poor bone health, but it isn’t clear whether it’s the multi-
ple health issues related to the smoking or the tobacco itself that weakens
the bones. Alcohol intake can also disrupt bone health by effects on the
parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the environment in the stomach.
Bone degeneration and loss
Both men and women start having age-related bone loss at about age 50, but
bone loss can be accelerated in individuals who didn’t develop maximum
120
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

peak bone mass. There are two levels of bone loss that can occur and are
associated with an increased risk for fractures:
 Osteopenia: Osteopenia, which is loss of bone mineral density (BMD), 
is the warning siren that the bones are thinning. This phase begins when
existing bone breaks down faster than the body can replace it. Preventing
transition into osteoporosis takes the combination of exercise, calcium,
and possibly some medications prescribed by your doctor.
 Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis — Latin for porous bone — takes years to
develop as bones slowly lose minerals, density, and structure, which
makes them weaker. If left untreated, osteoporosis can lead to stooped
posture, loss of height, and broken bones. See Figure 6-1 to compare a
bone with osteoporosis with a healthy bone.
The good news is that not everyone ends up with osteoporosis and
there are tests to determine how dense your bones are. The news may
not be that bad if you’ve made lifestyle choices that help and not hinder
bone strength. Making good choices still can’t guarantee that you won’t
develop osteoporosis, but it significantly helps your odds. After you’ve
been diagnosed with osteoporosis, you still have options to maintain
bone density, but prevention is your best bet for preserving bone.
All bones aren’t created equal. Women’s bones are smaller and less dense
than men’s, and women are four times more likely than men to suffer from
osteoporosis. This is because men in their 50s don’t experience the rapid
loss of bone mass that women do in the years following menopause. By age
65 or 70, however, men and women are losing bone mass at the same rate,
and the absorption of calcium decreases in both sexes. Excessive bone loss
causes bone to become fragile and more likely to fracture.

healthy bone
and one with
osteoporosis.

Chapter 6: Building Bones and Preserving Joints

Maintaining Healthy Bones
Face it: You take your bones for granted. Many folks haven’t had a broken
bone and don’t realize how important preserving that statistic is. Imagine
having to use crutches or a wheel chair for weeks due to a broken hip or leg.
Fractures of the spine, secondary to osteoporosis, affect more than 20 per-
cent of post-menopausal women and account for pain and interference with
activities of daily living. Mobility is important at any age, and supporting
good bone health as you age is one way to keep you on your feet.
An ounce of prevention: 
Live a healthy lifestyle
It’s never too late to start thinking about bone loss, but the earlier the better.
Whether you’re 20-something and still have time to build up your bones or
60-something and want to preserve what you have, keep reading to find out
the best ways to keep your bone bank balance on the plus side for as long as
possible. Just like an early investment of money, your early investment in
bone health can pay the biggest dividends when you’re older.
The formula for maintaining healthy bones isn’t a secret, but it does take a
heavy dose of practice and good common sense in the following areas:
122
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 
The smoker’s bone: Facts that clear the smoke
Most people are familiar with the effects of ciga-
rette smoking on the lungs. However, fewer
people are aware of smoking’s detrimental effects
on bones — and just how early bones start to
ache from the damage.
A smoker’s bone loss accelerates much more
rapidly than a nonsmoker’s for two main reasons:
 Smoking decreases the amount of calcium
absorbed from food and the way that vitamin
D works to manage calcium.
 Smoking inhibits the production of bone cells.
 Smoking lowers estrogen in men and women.
Estrogen is important because it helps hold
calcium in the bones.
The combination of these effects puts smokers at
a much higher risk for developing osteoporosis.
Substantial research shows that after surgeries
or broken bones, the healing time for smokers is
almost double that of nonsmokers.
In addition, female smokers have a 50 percent
greater risk of developing osteoporosis than
non-smokers. Smoking causes a decrease in the
production of estrogen, so menopausal symp-
toms begin earlier than in nonsmokers therefore
increasing their risk for osteoporosis from early
estrogen deficiency.

 Exercise regularly. The effects of exercise on the bones are continu-
ously researched, but it’s quite clear that certain exercises cause stress
on the bones, which stimulates the bones to hold on to calcium. The
reason weight-bearing exercise helps keep bones strong is that pulling
the muscles against the bone creates a force that stresses the bone.
That kind of stress drives calcium back into your bones, reinforcing
their strength. See Chapter 10 for specific ways to increase bone density
through weight training.
If you have osteoporosis, there are a few exercises that you should
avoid. High-impact exercises — such as jumping rope or jogging — or
exercises that make you bend or twist can place too much stress on the
bones and can increase your risk of fractures. Talk to your doctor about
an appropriate exercise regimen that’s good for your health condition.
 Consume good nutrition and supplements. Your body has two primary
ways to feed your bones a balanced meal: the foods you eat and the sup-
plements you take. Of course, getting the daily recommended nutrients
through fresh whole foods is your best bet because they’re in natural
form — your body is made to digest them. In addition to the obvious cal-
cium benefit of dairy foods and calcium-fortified beverages, you can get
calcium from eggs, canned fish (sardines, salmon with bones), soybeans
and other soy products (soy-based beverages, soy yogurt, tempeh),
some other dried beans, and some leafy greens (collard and turnip
greens, kale, bok choy, and broccoli).
Your body can’t absorb more than 600 to 700 milligrams of calcium at a
time. Eat small meals and snacks rich in calcium throughout the day to
ensure that you’re absorbing adequate calcium.
Getting regular bone-density screenings
As you age, the list of tests you should have done as a baseline reading just
keeps growing. Testing for osteoporosis is one more test that you should add
to the list. Exactly when you should have your first evaluation depends on
several factors. Here are some guidelines to go by.
We recommend screening if you have any of the following risk factors:
 You’ve gone through early menopause
 You’re 60 to 65 years old
 You’re over the age of 50, post menopausal, and have at least one other
risk factor for osteoporosis
 You have other diseases that effect bone loss, such as diabetes, kidney
disease, or hyperparathyroidism (excess release of parathyroid hormone)
 You’re taking medications, such as steroids or anticonvulsants, that
affect bone mineralization and resorption. Bone mineral density tests
123
Chapter 6: Building Bones and Preserving Joints

(BMD) measure how saturated your bones are with minerals such as 
calcium. By using X-rays, CT scans, or ultrasound technology, your
doctor can review the results and advise you of your bone strength.
You have a few options for a professional measurement of your bone density:
 Ultrasound: Your doctor may use ultrasound as the first test to see
whether your bone density is low. The test is usually performed on your
heel rather than the bones most likely to break from osteoporosis (like
your hip or spine). If the results are positive, your doctor schedules
DEXA (see the next bullet) to confirm the results.
 Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA): This fast test uses very low
doses of radiation and is the most accurate method for measuring BMD (it
can measure as little as a 2-percent bone loss per year). DEXA uses two X-
ray beams to estimate bone density in your spine and hip. The amounts of
each X-ray beam that are blocked by bone and soft tissue are compared to
each other. Bones with higher mineral density allow less of the X-ray beam
to pass through.
A regular X-ray can’t detect bone loss until the loss is greater than 
25 percent.
 Quantitative computed tomography (QCT): This test measures the den-
sity of a bone in your spine. QCT isn’t usually recommended because it’s
expensive, uses higher radiation doses, and is less accurate than DEXA.
BMD is described in terms of standard deviations (SD) from two different
norms. The T score compares your bone density to that of a typical 30 year
old, and the Z score compares you to others of your age. Being one standard
deviation below normal on either test is considered normal. Lower than –1,
the breakdown is as follows:
–1 to –2.5 SD = osteopenia
–2.5 or more = osteoporosis
–1 SD is equal to a bone loss of 10 to 12 percent on most tests.
Treating Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis can be detected early and treated effectively with diet, exercise,
and medication. It can’t be cured, but the main risk of osteoporosis — frac-
tures — can be reduced. After proper screening and evaluation, your doctor
can help you decide on the best treatment options based on your test results
and any other contributing medical factors. Women are the main candidates
for osteoporosis, and estrogen is essential for healthy bone density. When the
production of estrogen is reduced (primarily due to menopause in women),
bones become brittle and break easily. One of the options for treatment of
124
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

osteoporosis, therefore, is hormone therapy (HT), also called hormone
replacement therapy (HRT).
HT was once the mainstay of treatment for osteoporosis because it treated the
slowing of the bone resorption that occurs with estrogen deficiency. After some
major studies done by the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) found concerning
conclusions about hormone therapy and cardiovascular and breast cancer
risks, management with this therapy changed. Women at risk for certain forms
of cancer (endometrial and breast cancer) as well as some clotting disorders 
are cautioned against HT. Also, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) increases
the risk for heart attack, stroke, breast cancer, and blood clots. Discuss the 
various options with your doctor to determine which may be best for you.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been used much more conserva-
tively in recent years in light of its potential risks. HRT is now primarily used
in lower doses for shorter periods of time as a temporary treatment for the
worst menopausal symptoms, but only in women who don’t have heart dis-
ease or a strong family history of breast cancer or cardiovascular disease. In
such cases, HRT gives women relief from menopausal symptoms, and it slows
down the resorption of bone that occurs with estrogen decrease during
menopause.
If your doctor determines that HRT isn’t for you, and lifestyle changes don’t
help control your osteoporosis, prescription drugs can help slow bone loss
and may even increase bone density over time. These medications include
the following:
 Calcitonin (Miacalcin) is a naturally occurring substance found in the
body that works to balance the bone production and breakdown
process. This product is available as a nasal spray.
 Alendronate (Fosamax) and Risedronate (Actonel) represent a class of
medicines called bisphosphonates that treat osteoporosis. They serve
as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy and are available in
convenient once-a-week dosage forms. Studies have shown significant
improvement of bone mineral density following treatment. You need to
be able to remain upright for 30 minutes after taking bisphosphonates 
to avoid damage to your esophagus. These medications may also cause
osteonecrosis of the jaw, which is a deterioration of the jawbone, in
some patients. Make sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor
before taking these medications.
 Ibandronate sodium (Boniva) is a once-a-month bisphosphonate for
postmenopausal osteoporosis. It not only maintains bone density, but
also builds bones with just one tablet a month. As with other bisphos-
phonates, remain upright for at least 30 to 60 minutes after taking your
dose. Cases of osteonecrosis have also been reported in patients taking
Boniva, so discuss all options with your doctor.
 Raloxifene (Evista) is a selective estrogen modulator. In other words, it
offers the beneficial effects of estrogen on the bone but doesn’t have the
125
Chapter 6: Building Bones and Preserving Joints

detrimental effects of estrogen on endometrial (the tissue that lines the
uterus) and breast tissue.
 Teriparatide (Forteo) helps to reverse bone loss. It’s a natural bone-
building hormone that doubles the normal rate of bone formation and
stimulates new bone growth by increasing the number and action of
bone-forming cells.
Discuss medical treatment options with your doctor before taking any med-
ications. As with many prescriptions, certain risks and side effects may be
associated with each drug, and you also need to watch out for interactions
that may occur if you’re taking other meds.
Maintaining the Parts 
that Join Your Bones
As you age, your joints start to show the wear and tear from years of stoop-
ing, bending, jumping, running, and twisting in the form of osteoarthritis or
degenerative joint disease. You may be able to not only feel the effect of joint
disease, but also hear it — this kind of grinding noise when your joints rub
against each other is called crepitus.
Just because you can hear the effects of joint wear doesn’t mean that it’s
worse. Some people may have no audible crepitus and have much more
severe pain and disease. You may develop pains in your joints and realize
that other members of your family suffered from similar symptoms. There are
a few hereditary forms of joint disease that can cause symptoms at an early
age and can be much more severe than the age-related arthritis. Check out
the joints themselves for a better understanding of how arthritis works.
The components of joints 
and how they age
To get a better understanding of how your joints work, here’s a breakdown of
the components involved and the specific roles each one plays.
 Synovial fluid: To limit wear and tear in your joints, the cartilage is filled
with synovial fluid (a substance with a sticky consistency like a raw egg).
The joints can then move without friction.
 Ligaments: A ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue
composed mainly of long, stringy collagen fibers. Ligaments connect
bones to other bones to form a joint.
126
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

 Tendons: Tendons join muscle to bone and are very elastic in nature.
Tendons are tough and fibrous tissue. They’re often long and straight
and act as shock absorbers in your body. They help you walk, jump,
skip, and hop because when you contract your muscle, the tendon
moves the bone.
 Cartilage: All bones have a lining of cartilage to cushion the ends of 
the bones, preventing them from rubbing against each other when they
move. Cartilage is a type of dense connective tissue. It’s composed 
of fibers of collagen and elastin. If you’ve ever looked at the end of a
chicken bone, you may have noticed how white it is — cartilage doesn’t
contain blood vessels. You have cartilage in many places other than 
just your ear and nose — like your joints, rib cage, bronchial tubes, and
between intervertebral discs. Your tendons are also made of cartilage.
Cartilage is one of the first body parts you start to lose as you age. Because
cartilage no longer provides a cushion between your bones to keep them
from rubbing together, that old knee injury you suffered on the ski slopes in
your 20s is now bugging you in your 40s.
Think of it this way: When a spring-coiled seat cushion that was once as
comfy as a cloud starts to age, the padding wears away, the fabric becomes
threadbare, and the coils begin to poke the sitter painfully in the posterior!
Similarly, the cartilage that provides cushioning between the bones begins to
break down with age or excessive wear and tear (or both!). The friction of
two uncushioned bones rubbing together causes painful joint inflammation,
better known as arthritis. Ouch!
Keeping your joints flexible (or making
them that way)
Although arthritis isn’t preventable, you can take steps to reduce your risk of
developing the disease:
 Keeping off the pounds: Excess weight puts an extra strain on joints,
which can lead to arthritis.
 Eating right: Consuming foods rich in calcium and vitamin D helps with
weight control and strengthens bones and muscles.
 Maintaining reasonable physical activity and fitness levels: Exercise
helps develop strong muscles, which can protect and support joints. In
particular, strengthening the core muscles of the body (abs, back, and
stabilizer muscles) can enhance flexibility and improve balance
 Stretching: Stretching the joints of the extremities can maintain joint
health by increasing range of motion and maintaining strength of the
muscles that support the joints. See Stretching For Dummies (Wiley) by
LaReine Chabut for more information.
127
Chapter 6: Building Bones and Preserving Joints

In addition, some of the most effective ways to prevent joint pain may not make
you happy if you’re a smoker, professional athlete, or body builder, or if you
have a family history of related illnesses. If none of the aforementioned factors
describes you, then you have a much better chance of preventing joint pain.
If your joints are stiff and achy but you’re afraid that moving them will hurt
worse, think again. Movement is the best recommendation to loosen and
limber up stiff, achy joints. The longer your joints are immobilized, the more
they ache and the stiffer they become because the ligaments contract, leaving
you feeling like the tin man left out in the rain. If you already have arthritis,
read on to find out what you can do to feel better.
Coping with Joint Pain and Arthritis
The pain and deformity of arthritis have plagued human beings for as long
they’ve walked the earth. It shows up in the bones of cavemen and the mum-
mies of Egyptian pharaohs. For just as long, people have searched for med-
ications, herbs, and other concoctions to assuage achy joints — but a cure
for arthritis has proved elusive. As a result, sufferers are willing targets for
both effective therapies and snake oil.
Understanding arthritis
Arthritis is a single term that covers a wide range of joint disorders: Arth
means joint and itis means inflamed. More than 100 different types of arthritis
are known, and each type can have different symptoms. Most types of arthri-
tis show signs of joint inflammation like swelling and stiffness. Three of the
most common types of arthritis are
128
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 
Self-induced snap, crackle, and pop
Your joints can make all types of sounds when you
stretch them, but have you ever wondered why
your knuckles “pop” when you crack them? All
the joints in your body are surrounded by synovial
fluid that acts as a lubricant. This fluid contains
gasses such as, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon
dioxide. When you stretch your fingers to crack
the knuckles, you cause the bones of the joint to
pull apart causing the pressure in the capsule to
drop so low that gas is rapidly released forming
bubbles, which then burst . . . and “crack.”
And old wives’ tale associates this self-induced
joint cracking to arthritis. This cracking hasn’t
been found to be associated with any future risk
of arthritis.

 Osteoarthritis: This is a degenerative joint disease in which the joint’s
cartilage breaks down faster than your body is capable of rebuilding it.
After the cartilage wears down the ends of the bones, they start to rub
together, which causes inflammation and is painful. Figure 6-2 compares
a healthy joint to a joint with osteoarthritis.
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): This is actually an autoimmune disorder. It
causes chronic inflammation in which your own immune system attacks
your joints. It’s a disabling and painful inflammatory condition, render-
ing a person immobile and in pain due to joint destruction. RA is a sys-
temic disease, often affecting tissues throughout the body, including the
skin, blood vessels, heart, lungs, and muscles.
 Gout arthritis: This common type of arthritis (also called metabolic
arthritis) is caused by the chemical uric acid, a byproduct of protein
breakdown. In this condition, uric acid crystals are deposited on the
articular cartilage of joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues when too
much uric acid is in the bloodstream. These crystals create inflamed
tissue. Gout usually attacks the big toe (approximately 75 percent of first
attacks), but it can also affect other joints, such as the ankle, heel, knee,
wrist, elbow, fingers, and spine.
Osteoarthritis isn’t just for the elderly. Younger people can get it too. Many ath-
letes suffer from osteoarthritis after years of repetitive motion and excessive
wear and tear on their joints. People who work in repetitive or heavy-lifting
jobs should use joint-protecting devices and techniques to ensure proper lift-
ing and posture to help avoid injury, which can lead to the development of
arthritis.

Formulating a medical treatment 
plan for arthritis
If you’re experiencing joint pain and don’t know whether it’s an acute injury
or arthritis, see your doctor. Together you can formulate an inclusive plan 
for your health that may include medication, nutrition, and exercise. If you
have a joint injury, you can be causing more damage by waiting. If you have
osteoarthritis, you’re only delaying your options for relief and treatment.
Regardless of the type of joint pain you experience, treatment options are avail-
able. The following list provides examples of herbals and pharmaceuticals:
 Supplements: Glucosamine and chondroitin are large proteins naturally
present in joint tissue; glucosomine is used to build and repair cartilage,
and chondroitin gives cartilage its elasticity. Glucosamine is derived from
shellfish shells (if you’re allergic to it, talk to your doctor about alterna-
tives) and chondroitin from cow cartilage. Study results are often more
anecdotal than scientifically based, and the most comprehensive study
conducted by the NIH found no benefit to using the supplements over a
placebo. The two supplements are sometimes sold in a combination pill.
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Drugs like Aleve and
Advil or ibuprofen are available over the counter for joint pain. Talk to
your doctor before taking NSAIDs on a regular basis. The COX2 inhibitors
like Mobic and Celebrex are good NSAIDs, although they need to be used
with caution. Some have been pulled from the market due to their risks
and associations with adverse cardiac events (like Vioxx).
 Steroidals: Often steroids are injected right into the joint. If you have an
inflamed or swollen joint, or if you have pain or inflammation near a joint,
your doctor may inject a steroid preparation into the affected area. The
mildest is hydrocortisone; prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and triamci-
nolone are stronger. The stronger steroid preparations tend to be less 
soluble, and therefore remain in the joint longer. Benefit from the stronger
drugs is associated with a slightly increased risk of local side effects.
Fighting arthritis in other ways
In addition to combating arthritis with medication, you have some natural
options for relieving the pain. Get relief from making these changes:
 Weight loss: Maintaining a healthy weight goes a long way as a natural
and healthy remedy to arthritis and joint pain. Experts say that every
extra 10 pounds of weight you carry feels like 30 pounds on your knees.
Eliminating excess weight lightens the load for your body, freeing you 
to move more easily and comfortably.

Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

Keep in mind that you can’t eat your way out of arthritis or joint pain. 
In fact, overeating, or more specifically, being overweight is the most
controllable factor you have in alleviating joint pain.
 Exercise: Low impact exercise, such as swimming, bicycling, or an 
elliptical machine may be right up your alley if you’ve sustained a joint
injury but still want to lose weight through exercise. You may also con-
sider these exercises if your arthritis pain prevents you from engaging 
in more invigorating activity. The point is to keep moving. You need to
maintain muscle tone for joint stability. Yoga is another option for open-
ing up your range of movement, which is important if you have arthritis.
 Getting up in the morning: Arthritis is most painful in the morning when
you first wake up because you’ve been at rest all night. Your first step is 
to get out of bed, but do so slowly and carefully. You’ll find the most bene-
fit to relieving your stiffness and achiness if you continue to move and
stretch for 20 to 30 minutes first thing in the morning. Try going for a walk
or doing some yoga, but get up and move to lubricate your joints. Oh, and
don’t forget to breathe!
 Nutrition and dietary supplements: The information is mixed on what
type of diet is most helpful if you have osteoarthritis. Some studies suggest
that antioxidants such as those found in cherries may reduce osteoarthri-
tis. One Duke University study showed that diets high in carotenoids, the
chemicals that give some fruits and veggies their orange and yellow colors,
helped decrease the inflammation of osteoarthritis, while another Duke
study (done on animals rather than people) showed that high doses of 
vitamin C can increase the inflammation of osteoarthritis.
Also, the bromelain (a mixture of protein-digesting enzymes) in fresh
pineapples may have an anti-inflammatory effect.
What’s the best bet for now? Eat a healthy diet with a variety of fruits
and veggies and make note of what makes your osteoarthritis worse.
Different people may react differently to certain foods, and a food diary
may help you pinpoint what’s good — and not so good — for you.
 RICE method for an aching joint: The RICE method is a popular and
widely used method for treating joint pain, as well as minor injuries:
1. Rest: Reduce or stop using the injured area for 48 hours. If you
have a leg or foot injury, you may need to stay off it completely.
2. Ice: Put an ice pack on the injured area for 20 minutes at a time,
four to eight times per day. Use a cold pack, ice bag, or a plastic
bag filled with crushed ice that’s been wrapped in a towel.
3. Compression: Compression of an injured ankle, knee, or wrist may
help reduce the swelling. These compresses include bandages,
such as elastic wraps, special boots, air casts, and splints. Ask
your doctor which one is best.
4. Elevation: Keep the injured area elevated above the level of the
heart. Use a pillow to help elevate an injured limb.

Combating an Aching Back
If you’re like 80 percent of Americans, you’ve had back or neck pain at some
time in your life. Back-related complaints are the number one reason for work
related disability claims, and one of the most common reasons for people to
see their family doctor — not to mention the chiropractor or the orthopedist.
Why do so many people have bad backs? Most of them aren’t spending all
day outside planting crops or doing back breaking labor.
Backs can hurt for a number of reasons. Sometimes the reason is obvious,
such as muscle strain after a day of shoveling snow or raking leaves. Other
times there seems to be no cause at all — you get up in the morning, feel a
sharp twinge in the lower part of your back, and fall back onto the bed. Oh,
your aching back!
Back pain is considered chronic if it lasts for three months. Back pain can be
caused by any number of things; among the most common are
 Sprain or strain: Doing an activity you aren’t used to, like shoveling, can
strain or sprain muscles or ligaments. Work up to new activities slowly,
and remember that you won’t immediately feel pain from a sprain (a liga-
ment injury) or strain (a muscle injury); it may take up to 24 hours for the
pain to grab hold of you. Symptoms are usually short lived (less than one
month) and easily treated by rest, icing, NSAIDs, and time.
 Disc problems: The discs in your back act as cushioning shock absorbers,
but as you get older, the discs dry out and become brittle (disc degenera-
tion). If a disc ruptures and the thick inner jelly-like substance leaks out
and pushes on the spinal canal, this can cause pressure on the nerves
resulting in pain, weakness, or numbness. Surgery to remove the disc 
and fuse the vertebra above and below may be necessary if conservative
measures don’t have any effect after three months.
 Sciatica: Sciatica pain results when the sciatic nerve, which runs down
your buttocks and the back of your leg, is “pinched” by bulging discs or
excess bone or soft tissues. Surgery is necessary only if conservative mea-
sures fail and you have dysfunction of the affected area, such as foot drop
or numbness. Surgery called laminectomy or lamintomy removes or goes
through the lamina, the roof of the spinal canal, to remove the disc caus-
ing the problem.
 Spinal stenosis: This condition is most often associated with aging and
disc degeneration; the spinal canal narrows, putting pressure on the
spinal nerves, causing an achy or electrical pain down an arm or leg.
Spinal stenosis progresses over time and may require surgery if conserva-
tive measures like rest, exercise, anti-inflammatories, or spine support
don’t work.
132
Part II: Workin' on Your Framework 

If you’re having any symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or severe pain in
your arms or legs you should see your medical doctor. You may need to have
further testing done to see if there is severe damage to your discs. You don’t
want to start any therapy or exercise prior to having these tests done. If tests
are normal, you can proceed to try other modalities, such as chiropractic or
massage therapy.

t’s no secret that good nutrition can help you live a
longer, healthier life. Understanding what makes food
good for you — the nutrients, phytochemicals, vitamins,
and minerals — can help you make wiser choices about
what you eat.
This part gets you started on improving what you put 
in your body in the way of nutrition and supplements 
and seeing the benefits of what your body can give in
return . . . longevity.

Chapter 7
You Are What You 
Eat: Nutrition 101
In This Chapter
 Knowing the importance of nutrition as you age
 Checking out different kinds of food that are good for your body
 Living a healthy life and making healthy habits
 Reading labels on your food
T
he phrase “Garbage in, garbage out” is just as true for your body as it is
for your computer. If your diet lacks nutrients, or if you eat too much or
too little, the results show up as health problems and feeling ill, especially as
you age. Although you may think of nutrition issues primarily in terms of your
weight, the effects of a poor diet are far more than skin deep; serious health
problems such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, and
osteoporosis can stem from poor nutrition and can reduce your chances of
living a long and healthier life.
In this chapter, we look at the importance of good nutrition (and we define it)
and how your body’s nutritional needs may change as you age. We also offer
info on reading nutritional labels (the ones you need your glasses to read!),
and then we recommend some diets for healthy, nutrition-smart aging.
The Importance of Nutrition — 
and Why You Should Care
All food isn’t equal when it comes to keeping you healthy as you get older.
Case in point: Although a plate of brown rice and a candy bar have about the
same number of calories, the brown rice is much healthier. But given a choice
between the rice and the candy bar, most people would choose the candy bar.
In this section, we plan to educate you about food — what’s in it, why some

foods are much better for you than others, and why getting the proper nutri-
tion helps you age well. Our goal is to increase your motivation to put 
down the candy bar and pick up something that’s good for you . . . at least
most of the time.
How the good foods work for you . . .
A healthy diet helps you age well, but what constitutes a healthy diet? The
answer is, a diet that delivers the nutrients you need after the food’s broken
down and absorbed by your digestive system.
Most everything you put in your mouth has some nutrients, but some foods
have more macronutrients — nutrients that your body uses in larger amounts,
which comprise proteins, carbs, and fats — and micronutrients — nutrients
that your body requires in smaller amounts, such as vitamins and minerals —
than others. In addition, some foods have additional properties that promote
extra health benefits and help boost your immune system, which weakens as
you age. These additional components may include the following:
 Antioxidants: These compounds help fight free radicals that result from
oxidation. Oxidation is the loss of electrons in atoms; free radicals can
damage cells and cause disease or deterioration in your body. Oxidation
appears to increase as you age, making antioxidants a valuable player on
the anti-aging field.
Foods that contain vitamins A, C, and E, beta carotene, selenium, and
lycopene (found in tomatoes) are rich with antioxidants. Most brightly
colored fruits and vegetables contain essential antioxidants too, which
are more beneficial when consumed in food than taken in supplement
form. Antioxidants also help keep your immune system strong.
 Bioflavanoids: Bioflavanoids are the brightly colored pigments found in
fruits, red wine, and vegetables; they’re a class of antioxidants (see pre-
ceding bullet) necessary for vitamin C absorption. They also strengthen
blood vessels and have anti-inflammatory properties.
 Omega-3 and -6 fatty acids: These essential oils are found in some fish,
meats, eggs, walnuts, corn, safflower, and oils such as canola and flaxseed.
Studies show that they may protect against heart disease by lowering
triglyceride blood levels as well as possibly decreasing rheumatoid arthri-
tis, depression, macular degeneration, and asthma. These fatty acids are
best utilized by the body when obtained from food instead of supplements.
 Phyoestrols: Phyoestrols are found in plants; they work to lower LDL
(low density lipoproteins, the “bad” cholesterol) blood levels. There are
two types of phyoestrols: sterols and stanols. Both are found in fruits,
legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and vegetable oils. Some food prod-
ucts are fortified by phyesterols. These foods include orange juice, some
cereals, salad dressing, and lowfat milk.
138
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

 Probiotics: Probiotics are living microorganisms that positively benefit
you. They improve the health and functioning of your gastrointestinal
tract (GI) and may help boost your immune system. Probiotics such as
bacteria and yeast help balance the flora (microorganisms) found in
your intestinal tract, killing off the bad bacteria and allowing the good
bacteria to flourish.
You never knew there was such a thing as good bacteria? Yes, indeed.
One example is one many women are familiar with — the development
of a yeast infection after taking antibiotics. This infection happens
because bacteria, not being too choosy, kill off the good bacteria that
normally keep yeast proliferation under control. Without them, yeast
runs rampant and you have a yeast infection. Probiotics are found in
some yogurts and dairy products, as well as supplements.
 Prebiotics: Prebiotics are found in whole grains, bananas, honey, onions,
artichokes, and fortified food products. They also help balance flora in
the GI tract and may aid in calcium absorption.
. . . and how the bad foods 
work against you
Sooner or later, bad nutrition shows up in your health. While you may be able
to eat poorly for a few months (or even a few years) without getting sick,
sooner or later the sustained effects of poor eating habits appear in various
forms, the most dangerous being serious disease.
The following diseases can be brought about or worsened by poor food
choices:
 Heart disease: Heart disease is the nation’s leading killer for both men
and women and is caused by a number of factors including heredity, high
blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and inactivity. Factors
like heredity can’t be modified (you can’t ever really fire your relatives),
so watching what you eat is one way to try to prevent heart disease.
 Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes can be mostly attributed to controllable factors
including excess weight, lack of exercise, and poor nutrition. Although the
genes you inherit may influence the development of type 2 diabetes, they
pale in comparison to your behavioral and lifestyle factors.
The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a landmark study sponsored
by the National Institutes of Health, found that people with an increased
risk for diabetes can prevent or delay the onset of the disease by losing
5 to 7 percent of their body weight through a lowfat, low-calorie eating
plan and by getting 30 minutes of physical activity five days a week.
 High blood pressure: Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to
stroke, heart attack, heart failure, or kidney failure. Saturated fat can
139
Chapter 7: You Are What You Eat: Nutrition 101

increase your blood pressure as well as your cholesterol. Saturated fat
increases the level of low density lipoproteins (LDL), which tend to stick
to the sides of the arterial wall. This deposit, called atherosclerosis, begins
with the accumulation of fatty streaks on the inner arterial walls. When
this fatty buildup enlarges and becomes hardened with minerals, such
as calcium, it forms plaque. Plaque stiffens the arteries and narrows the
passages through them. As a result, blood pressure rises.
Increasing the amount of vegetables and fruits and reducing the amount
of fat and cholesterol not only reduces blood pressure but also helps
with weight loss, which also lowers blood pressure.
Sugar may be as big a villain in raising blood pressures as salt, according
to research, because consumption of sugar induces salt and water reten-
tion. A diet high in processed foods and sugar caused study blood lipid
levels to rise significantly.
 High cholesterol: Cholesterol is necessary for the formation of cell
membranes, some hormones, and vitamin D. LDL carry cholesterol
through the bloodstream from the liver to the rest of the body. Excess
LDL can be deposited on the walls of blood vessels, causing heart dis-
ease. High density lipoproteins (HDL) carry cholesterol back to the liver,
so a high level of HDL in your blood removes excess cholesterol from
the bloodstream so it doesn’t get deposited on the blood vessel walls.
Fats are also an essential part of your diet; they carry cholesterol to and
from your liver. But saturated and trans fats are bad for you because
they can raise blood cholesterol levels, which can lead to increased risk
for heart disease. Saturated fats are found mostly in animal fats and dairy
products, while trans fats are found in commercially prepared baked
goods, snack foods, and just about anything that tastes really good but
that you know is bad for you. Saturated fats raise both good cholesterol
(HDL) and bad cholesterol (LDL), with a negative effect overall, while
trans fats go one bad step further, lowering HDL and raising LDL.
 Osteoporosis: Bones need calcium to stay strong, especially as you get
older. As many as one half of women over 50 and one quarter of men
(yes, men get osteoporosis too) have osteoporosis. Calcium can be
obtained from dairy products and leafy green vegetables.
You can take calcium supplements but you need to take your daily dose
in divided doses, because only around 500 mg of calcium can be absorbed
into your bloodstream at one time.
 Cancer: Changes in your diet and regular exercise are critical compo-
nents to prevent cancer. Up to 30 percent of cancers in developed coun-
tries like the United States may be linked to poor nutrition, obesity, and
lack of exercise, according to the American Cancer Society. For example,
a high-fat diet is linked to an increase in colorectal cancer. Obesity in
general is an independent cancer risk, according to some studies, linked
to colon cancer and postmenopausal breast cancer in particular, as well
as cancers of the endometrium, pancreas, prostate, and kidney.

Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

How Nutritional Needs Change As You Age
As you age, changes occur in your body that can affect your nutritional needs.
The aging process affects the body’s absorption of many nutrients. For exam-
ple, you’re less able to absorb nutrients such as calcium. This change occurs
because as you age your stomach secretes less hydrochloric acid, which may
reduce the amount of calcium absorbed. Your body also excretes, or elimi-
nates, more nutrients. For example, hormonal changes may result in more cal-
cium being excreted through the kidneys. So with these examples in mind, you
need to take in more nutrients to absorb the same amount, or you may
become deficient in that vitamin or mineral.
As you age, focus on increasing the levels of the following nutrients:
 Calcium: Hormonal changes may decrease calcium absorption as it
increases loss of calcium through the kidneys. In addition, you may
become lactose intolerant (lose some of your ability to digest lactose, the
sugar in milk). Because of this condition, some people decrease their
intake of dairy products, which are good sources of calcium. But you
still need to get the calcium from somewhere. Most people don’t eat
enough dairy products or veggies to get adequate calcium from their
diet and should consider supplementation. The amount of calcium can
vary with age or medical conditions, but in general adults should have
about 1,000 mg a day, and if you’re over the age of 50 increase the dose
to 1,200 mg daily.
 Iron: Iron is necessary to carry oxygen to your cells, but it’s difficult to
get all you need because most foods contain only a little iron. The best
source of iron is in red meat, but you can also get iron from poultry, fish,
whole grain or enriched breads and cereals, dry beans, and some fruits
and vegetables. Women over age 50 should get 50 mg of iron a day where
as men only need 10 mg.
Vitamin C helps you absorb more iron from foods, so be sure you include
foods with vitamin C (such as citrus fruits, greens, and tomatoes) in the
same meal as foods with iron.
Taking too many iron supplements can be lethal. Talk to your doctor
before taking iron supplements. A less common, but very serious prob-
lem, more often found in men, is caused by excessive absorption and
storage of iron. This condition is known as haemochromatosis. Over
time, iron builds up in body tissues and because the normal body can’t
increase iron excretion, the absorbed iron accumulates in the body. 
This excess iron can damage organs like the liver and heart, and may
contribute to heart disease.

Figuring Out Which Types 
of Foods You Need
Sure, you’ve seen the food pyramid — colored horizontal lines with bottles 
of milk and smiling vegetables plastered on it, telling you what percentage of
which nutrients you need each day. Ho hum. And out of date, besides. Welcome
to the interactive age, and the new improved food pyramid (see Figure 7-1),
which is all about personal nutrition — you and your individual needs. (And
the bars on the pyramid are now vertical instead of horizontal, making it look
more like a pyramid and less like a squashed layer cake).
MyPyramid was unveiled by the USDA in April 2005. Its purpose is two-fold:
 To convey the USDA and Department of Health and Human Services
dietary guidelines (there’s a noble, but somewhat boring sounding goal)
 To make Americans aware of the vital health benefits of simple and
modest improvements in nutrition, physical activity, and lifestyle 
behavior (in other words, how small changes in nutrition and activity
can make you a much better you)
We know you’re just dying to know what kinds of foods make up the new and
improved pyramid. You can visit the Web site at www.mypyramid.gov, but
here are the general guidelines:
 Grains: Grains, which include bread, rice, cereal, and wheat, are big —
very big — on the new food pyramid. Daily recommendations are five to
eight ounces (a serving is about an ounce). A half cup of cooked rice or
grains such as couscous or a slice of bread also count as a serving (if
you’re not big on ounces). Three servings should be whole grain foods.
 Veggies: The USDA wants you to eat your veggies — two to five servings
each day. Vegetables are divided into five different categories: leafy green,
orange, starchy, dry beans and peas, and other, which includes such odd
fellows like lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and brussel sprouts.
 Fruits: The new food pyramid suggests two cups of fruit a day in most
cases, depending on your age and sex. One fruit generally counts as a
cup. Check out the Web site for a chart with individual fruits.
 Oils: You can have between five to seven teaspoons of oil daily. That
doesn’t sound terribly appetizing straight, so you can use oil to prepare
foods, or you can also take your oils in nuts or fish, which are also in
this category.
 Milk: Just about everyone needs three cups a day from the milk group,
which includes cottage cheese, yogurt, and pudding.
142
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

 Meat and beans: You need around five to six ounces of protein, which
includes meat, eggs, peanut butter, chicken, and fish. This category also
includes dry beans.
 Discretionary calories: Your government realizes that you’re only
human and are probably going to eat some things each day that aren’t
part of any recognizable food group, like Pop-Tarts. You’re therefore
allowed between 200 and 500 calories to squander any way you wish,
but the pyramid suggests you eat something from one of the recogniz-
able food groups.
 Exercise: Get off the couch and do something every day — for at least 30
minutes. Walking through the discount chain store does not count as a
moderate or vigorous activity, so plan to walk briskly, run, play golf (no
cart allowed!), play basketball, or climb rocks, if your heart desires.

Counting Calories and Determining 
Your Daily Need
It’s common for people to say they’re “counting their calories” or “watching
their calories”, but in reality, calories aren’t something you can get your
hands around. A calorie is the amount of energy, or heat, that it takes to raise
the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit).
To lose one pound of fat, you need to burn 3,500 calories.
To further complicate the terminology, what we refer to as a calorie isn’t
really a calorie at all; it’s a kilocalorie, which equals 1000 calories. Who
decided to drop the “kilo” when counting calories in foods? Probably some-
one who got tired of writing the word kilocalories!
For better or for worse, however, the term calorie is used in general conver-
sation to describe food energy. You need a certain number of calories each
day based on the amount of energy you burn. And the amount of energy you
burn is determined by your metabolism, your weight, and your activity levels.
Regardless of your diet, if you take in more calories than you need, you gain
weight. In fact, if you consume 3,500 more calories per week than you need,
you gain one pound. If you want to lose one pound, the reverse is also true —
you need to consume 3,500 fewer calories per week or burn 3,500 more calo-
ries (although keep in mind that your body requires a minimum amount of
calories everyday to function, so cut back on calories slowly). If you reduce
your daily calories by 500 each day (the max you should eliminate from your
daily intake), in one week you can lose one pound.
If you eat all the recommended servings of each food group, no more, no less,
you can get your recommended amounts of nutrients without consuming too
many calories. Monitoring your portion sizes is also important to make sure
you get just the right amounts (see the nearby sidebar, “Portion sizes made
simple” for help understanding appropriate portion sizes).
To figure out how many calories you need to consume each day, check out
the following sections.
144
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

Calculating daily calories 
burned just by being alive
Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the basic number of calories you need
every day to keep your body up and running and to maintain your breathing,
heartbeat, and body temperature. Everyone’s BMR is different.
About 60 to 70 percent of your body’s energy goes into pure maintenance.
The other 30 to 40 percent is used for your daily activities. The more you do
physically each day, the higher number of calories (energy) you need.
A common BMR calculator is the Harris-Benedict formula (if you’re really bad
at math or have problems using the formula you can use an online BMR 
calculator).
 Adult male: 66 + (6.3 × body weight in lbs.) + (12.9 × height in inches) –
(6.8 × age in years)
 Adult female: 655 + (4.3 × weight in lbs.) + (4.7 × height in inches) – 
(4.7 × age in years)
Gauging daily calories 
burned through activity
Calculate how many calories you expend per day with physical activity.
This formula is a bit more complicated. It uses an activity multiplier (a number
that adjusts the calculation for activity levels) and your BMR (see preceding
section). Be honest about your activity level (some people aren’t) when figur-
ing out how much you can eat each day.
You expend the following calories, depending on your lifestyle:
 Sedentary = BMR × 1.2 (little or no exercise, desk job)
 Lightly active = BMR × 1.375 (light exercise/sports 1–3 days per week)
 Moderately active = BMR × 1.55 (moderate exercise/sports 3–5 days per
week)
 Very active = BMR × 1.725 (hard exercise/sports 6–7 days per week)
 Extremely active = BMR × 1.9 (hard daily exercise/sports and physical
job or training twice daily for marathons, contests, and so on)
145
Chapter 7: You Are What You Eat: Nutrition 101

Figuring out total calories your 
body needs to function well
After you know how many calories your body needs for basic functions and
what your body is going to use based on your activity level (see preceding
two sections), you can calculate your daily total caloric need or Total Daily
Energy Expenditure (TDEE). This is the amount of calories your body expends
in 24 hours. All you need to do to get that number is multiply your BMR times
your activity level.
For example, if your BMR is 1339 calories per day. Your activity level is mod-
erately active (work out 3–4 times per week). Your activity factor is 1.55 (see
preceding section). Your TDEE = 1.55 × 1339 = 2075 calories/day.
Picking the Right Macronutrients
(Protein, Carbs, and Fats)
The changes in recommendations on what type of macronutrients are best for
you from year to year may have you feeling a bit like Alice in Wonderland —
which foods make you healthy, which ones make you sick? They may also
leave you feeling like, “What’s the use? The recommendations are going to all

Portion sizes made simple
Because you can’t always take measuring cups
or a scale with you when you dine, here are
some fun ways to eyeball your food portions
using your hands or some other household
object:
 1 teaspoon of butter or peanut butter is
about the size of the tip of your thumb.
 1 ounce of cheese is about as thick as two
dominoes.
 1 ounce of nuts can fit in the palm of your
hand.
 A 3-ounce serving of meat is about the size
and thickness of a deck of playing cards.

1⁄2 cup of ice cream is about the size of a
tennis ball.

1⁄2 cup of fruit or vegetables can fit in the
palm of your hand.
 1 cup of cooked mashed potatoes is about
the size of your fist.
 1 cup of broccoli is about the size of a light
bulb.
 A medium apple or orange is about the size
of a tennis ball.

change next year anyway.” One year butter’s out, the next year it’s margarine.
Fish is good, but watch out for mercury. Beef is bad — no, it’s good, at least
some types are.
If you read the food-pyramid section earlier in this chapter and discovered
your daily needs online, you know how many servings of each food type you
should have — now you just need to refine your choices. In the next section,
we help you figure out how to pick the best macronutrients out of the bewil-
dering number of choices available.
Consuming complete proteins, 
no matter your lifestyle
Protein is a dietary essential, even for vegans, who don’t eat animal protein in
any way, shape, or form. Proteins are made up of tissue building blocks called
amino acids, and proteins that contain all the essential amino acids (amino
acids that the body can’t make and therefore must be obtained in foods) are
called “complete.” Animal protein is a good example of a complete protein,
while the proteins found in grains, nuts, and vegetables are incomplete, 
and you must carefully balance them to obtain all the essential amino acids
in your diet.
Although protein isn’t a high source of energy, your body uses proteins to
grow and to build hormones, antibodies, and the enzymes that regulate the
chemical reactions within the body. Proteins are essential for healthy aging
because they maintain healthy tissues and sustain growth. Because protein
can’t be stored in the body, you need a new supply every day to keep tissues
from breaking down.
Getting just enough
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) says that to be healthy, 20 percent
of your total daily calories should come from protein. So if your optimal daily
caloric intake is 1,800 calories (more on counting calories earlier in this chap-
ter), 360 of them should be in the form of protein.
Can you eat too much protein? It depends. A large study indicated that women
who ate over 95 grams of protein per day were 20 percent more likely to suffer
a wrist fracture over a 12-year period. The same study, however, showed that
women who ate the most protein (up to 110 grams a day) were 25 percent less
likely to have a heart attack or stroke compared to women who ate less pro-
tein (68 grams a day). The safest bet is to take in around 70 grams of protein
each day.
On the other hand, too little protein has serious health consequences, lead-
ing to muscle loss, failure to grow properly, and a weakened immune system.

Considering the source
Red meat is a good source of complete protein, but some red meat also con-
tains a large amount of saturated fat, which can raise your cholesterol levels
and contribute to heart disease. So poultry and fish, which contain less satu-
rated fat, provide a better source of protein. And if you’re vegetarian, you
don’t have to worry about the high levels of saturated fats in meat — dry
beans and nuts are excellent sources of protein. Most servings of protein
supply around 24 grams of protein.
Your protein needs depend on your activity level, age, and if you’re dieting.
Use the following equation to calculate your protein needs:
Weight x 0.6 grams of protein per pound
For example: 170 pounds × 0.6 = 102 grams of protein per day. Remember that
this formula is an approximation. Check with your doctor, too.
You can break down your protein choices like this:
 Complete proteins: These contain all essential amino acids. Examples
include the following:
• Beef: Lean beef contains less than 10 percent fat, but be careful —
this doesn’t apply to ground beef, which, in some states, doesn’t
even have to display the exact fat content on the label. Mix ground
turkey with regular ground beef to cut the fat.
• Poultry (chicken, turkey, and duck): Some people eat so much
poultry that they really should cluck. And that’s a good thing,
because the white meat in poultry is high in protein, low in fat, and
low in cholesterol. Remember to remove the skin (that’s where
most of the fat is) and stick to white meat, which has less fat than
dark meat. Poultry contains about 0.5 grams of saturated fat and
delivers a walloping 30 plus grams of protein per serving.
148
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 
A calorie-estimating tool for the 
mathematically challenged
You can estimate your daily calorie needs by
using this easier formula:
 For sedentary people: Weight × 14 = esti-
mated cal/day
 For moderately active people: Weight × 17
= estimated cal/day
 For active people: Weight × 20 = estimated
cal/day

• Fish: Some fish is very low in saturated fats; most types of fish
have less than 1 gram of saturated fat per serving. A few have 2
grams — salmon and tuna among them. Fish is a good source of
protein as long as you don’t fry it in saturated fat. Fish is also a
good source of omega-3 fatty acids. The fish that’s best for these
fatty acids include salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, and whitefish.
Fish contains around 20 grams of protein per serving.
Farm raised fish don’t have the same amounts of omega-3 fatty
acids and can have high levels of mercury.
• Pork: Pork has about the same amount of saturated fat (2 grams
per serving) as lean beef, even when you trim the fat before eating.
Although the pork industry is promoting it as the “other white
meat,” pork is higher in saturated fat than poultry and shouldn’t 
be a nightly dinner choice. Pork has around 25 grams of protein
per serving.
• Lamb: Lamb is also high in fat compared to poultry; in fact, it’s
slightly higher (3 grams per serving) than pork in saturated fat.
• Eggs: Eggs contain about 6.25 grams of protein and are only 75
calories. The egg white is only 17 calories. They have 3.5 grams of
saturated fat, which is mostly contained in the yolk, but the yolk
contains most of the amino acids and 40 percent of the protein.
 Incomplete proteins: These don’t contain all essential amino acids.
Incomplete proteins include
• Dry beans: Dry beans and lentils are excellent sources of protein,
although you may not think of them as such. Beans contain around
7 grams of protein and lentils about 9 grams protein per half cup
and less than one gram of saturated fat. To obtain all the essential
amino acids, you need to combine them with other sources of pro-
tein that contain the rest of the essential amino acids.
• Nuts: Nuts are a good source of protein, around 5 grams per serving,
but are also high in saturated fats; a serving contains anywhere
from 4 grams (almonds) to 16 grams (brazil nuts). Macadamia 
nuts are also high in saturated fats, about 12 grams per serving. Nuts
are also an incomplete source of protein.

Chapter 7: You Are What You Eat: Nutrition 101
The added benefits of soy protein
What about soy? Soy products are everywhere,
and you may have heard that soy is superior to
animal protein and can lower cholesterol and
reduce the risk of heart disease. Recent studies
by the American Heart Association show that
taking in 50 grams of soy protein a day (over half
your daily requirement of protein) reduced LDL
only about three percent, not a large amount 
but worth considering if you’re fighting high
cholesterol.

Choosing good carbs
Carbohydrates are an important part of your diet because they help supply
the energy that your body needs to function. They are so important that the
USDA recommends that half of your daily calorie intake should come from
carbs. Carbohydrates fall into two categories:
 Simple, which contain refined sugars, with minimal fiber, vitamins, and
minerals
 Complex, which contain more fiber, vitamins, and minerals
All carbohydrates are broken down and used for energy. The goal when
choosing carbs is to chose complex carbs that increase energy storage at a
slow, steady pace, to help control blood sugar levels. Sugars (simple carbs)
are broken down most easily and cause a quick infusion of glucose (blood
sugar) into your blood. This surge gives an immediate boost of energy, but it
also causes blood sugar to drop rapidly and can leave you feeling weak.
Separating healthy carbs and unhealthy carbs: The glycemic index
Today, there’s an increased emphasis on the glycemic index (GI) of foods. The
glycemic index categorizes foods by how quickly they’re broken down and
enter the bloodstream and how high your blood sugar rises after eating them
compared to pure glucose. Foods with a low glycemic index are considered
most healthy. They’re rated on a scale from 0-100, with the lower numbers
being healthiest.
Sugars have a high glycemic index, while starches such as whole grains have
a lower glycemic index and stabilize your blood sugar because they take
longer to break down. (Fibers can’t be broken down in the body and pass
through unchanged.) So starches like whole grains and vegetables with a low
glycemic index are your best choice for carbohydrates. Processed foods like
white bread are stripped of much of the fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and
they have a higher glycemic index, making less processed food like whole
grain bread a much healthier choice.
Assessing a food’s carbohydrate makeup: Glycemic load
Just to complicate things, carbohydrates are further categorized by their
glycemic load (GL), which takes into consideration the amount of carbohy-
drates consumed. Two items might be similar on the GI but your blood sugars
and insulin response are affected differently if you eat a greater amount of
one than the other, which is the GL. You determine the glycemic load by taking
the GI, dividing by 100, then multiplying by the carbohydrate count in the food.
For example:
150
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

1. A cup of cooked spaghetti has a GI of 42.
42 ÷ by 100 = .42.
2. A cup of cooked spaghetti contains 38 carbs (subtract fiber, if any,
from the total carb count since it isn’t digested).
.42 × 38 = 16. So 16 is GL for a cup of cooked spaghetti.
For a list of common foods and their glycemic loads, see Table 7-1. The table
helps you pick carbs with the lowest glycemic load per serving, anything below
10 is considered low, anything over 20 is considered high.

Fighting off the bad fats and getting
enough of the good ones
You may be conditioned to think of fat as something bad to eat, but you need
“good” fat in your diet for your body to function properly. You need fat to help
with absorption of fat soluble vitamins, to regulate cholesterol metabolism,
and to keep your skin soft and healthy.
Eating fat doesn’t make you fat. Excess body fat comes from consuming too
many calories (of any kind) that aren’t used as energy but are stored away in
the body as fat reserves.
Fat is either saturated or unsaturated:
 Saturated fat can be included in your diet, but should be limited due to
the risks of elevated cholesterol.
 Unsaturated fat is good for you, lowering your LDL and raising your HDL.
High cholesterol can be related to heredity. Seventy-five percent of the cho-
lesterol in your blood is manufactured in your liver; only 25 percent comes
from what you eat. Reducing cholesterol rich foods can play a small part in
reducing your cholesterol levels. Total cholesterol levels are optimal if under
200 milligram per deciliter; LDL should be less than 100 mg/dl, and HDL
should be greater than 40 mg/dl.
Gathering near the good fats
Most people don’t realize that fat plays a necessary role in their diet. The
important thing is to make sure you have the right balance of good and bad
fats. Healthy fats such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are ben-
eficial to your body, but they need to be consumed in moderation.
You need healthy fats in your diet for the following vital reasons:
 To develop and maintain gray matter in your brain
 To achieve optimal growth
 To maintain the health and structure of cell membranes
 To keep skin healthy
 To maintain proper visual development
 To maintain a healthy nervous system
 To regulate blood pressure, blood clotting, and your body’s inflamma-
tory response
152
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

Experts don’t always agree on exactly what percentage of your daily calories
should come from fat. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)
people should restrict dietary fat intake to 30 percent of daily calories, and
according to the USDA, you need 30 percent of your daily calories from fats.
The American Heart Association suggests 20 to 30 percent, while some experts
believe that people may only need as little as 10 percent of calories in the
form of fat.
You don’t need to add a lot of extra fat to your diet; just make healthy food and
cooking choices to get enough of the nutrients from the healthy fats you need.
Omega-3 fatty acids are one type of “good fat.” There are many supplements
that provide these fatty acids, because most people don’t consume enough of
the foods that contain omega-3s. Good sources of the omega-3 fatty acids are
found in the following foods:
 Cold-water fish like mackerel, salmon, sardines, anchovies, and herring.
The oils of wild-caught fish contain a significantly higher proportion of
Omega-3 than the oils of farm-raised fish.
 Nuts, such as walnuts, Brazil nuts, and almonds along with pumpkin,
sunflower, and flax seeds
Saying no to the bad fats
Many foods nowadays have been processed and reformulated to create a
variation of the original (think chicken nuggets or peanut butter). The same
is true with fat. On the one hand, polyunsaturated fat is an essential fatty acid
that’s good for you; but on the other hand, saturated fats and trans fatty acids
clog your arteries, raise your bad cholesterol, lower your good cholesterol,
and — unfortunately! — taste scrumptious in donuts.
Saturated fats and trans fats are bad for your health for the following reasons:
 Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperature, and they’re a major
dietary factor in raising cholesterol. The main sources of saturated fat in
the typical American diet are foods from animals and some plants. These
sources include whole milk, butter, cheese, ice cream, red meat and dark
meat, milk chocolate, coconuts, coconut milk, and coconut oil.
 Trans fats should be avoided altogether because they can raise your
total LDL (bad) cholesterol and lower HDL (good) cholesterol, putting
you at risk for high blood pressure and heart disease. Examples of trans
fat include most margarines, vegetable shortening, partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil, deep-fried anything, many fast foods, and most commer-
cially baked goods.
153
Chapter 7: You Are What You Eat: Nutrition 101

According to the USDA, no more than 10 percent of your daily calories should
come from saturated fats. There’s no official recommendation from the USDA
for trans fats percentage, so we recommend that if you eat them at all, you
share your 10-percent allotment between the two.
Make sure to read your food labels and ask about trans fat when you dine out.
But generally, some foods to avoid with saturated and trans fats include
 Butter
 Cookies
 Crackers
 Doughnuts
 French fries
 Fried foods (like fried chicken)
 Ice cream
 Margarine
According to a recent study of some 80,000 women, for every 5 percent
increase in the amount of saturated fat a woman consumes, her risk of heart
disease increases by 17 percent. But just a 2 percent increase in trans fats
increases her risk of heart disease by 93 percent!
Positive Nutritional Habits 
for Healthy Living
Nutrition isn’t just about food. Nutrition is the foundation for a strong immune
system, disease prevention, and a healthy body. Nutrition offers multiple
opportunities to improve health without a lot of effort. Boost your nutritional
intake by purchasing organic foods, avoiding unhealthy food additives, and
reducing salt.
Put down the salt shaker
Sodium causes vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels which
decreases the amount of space through which blood can travel (think water
through a fire hose). This increased resistance makes it more difficult for the
arteries to expand with each beat of the heart, causing the internal pressure
to rise.
154
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

A high sodium intake can raise your blood pressure, so hiding the salt shaker
and avoiding processed foods may help lower your blood pressure. High
sodium foods include processed meats, salted snack foods, cheeses, and
canned foods. Also, many frozen dinners and canned soups are loaded with
sodium.
Start reading food labels to help lower your sodium intake. Your body gets all
the sodium it needs from a balanced healthy diet. If you miss the flavor of salt,
try fresh herbs, which are full of essential vitamins and bursting with flavor.
These herbs include oregano, cilantro, and basil.
Restricting sodium intake to lower blood pressure appears to work better if
accompanied by increasing your potassium intake. Good dietary sources of
potassium include bananas, potatoes, avocados, tomato juice, grapefruit
juice, and acorn squash.
Make mine organic?
Organic foods are grown using farming techniques designed to reduce pollu-
tion, decrease use of pesticides, and conserve soil and water resources. These
types of food are all the rage these days — even your local grocery store may
have an organic section. Organic foods don’t look any different from foods
throughout the rest of the grocery, but the price tag is surely different. So
should you shell out the extra bucks for expensive organic foods? Is USDA
Organic just another designer label? We give you the answers in this section.
Organic foods have less exposure to pesticides, antibiotics used for growth,
and chemical fertilizers — all of which certainly sound like they should lead
to healthier food. But is it that much more healthy than what you’ve been
eating for years?
Researchers debate the importance of the organic label based on the lack of
substantial evidence supporting differences in quality or safety, but some
studies show that organic produce contains more nutrients than traditionally
grown products. Organic products are definitely exposed to fewer pesticides,
additives, and preservatives. If you can find them and afford them, organic
products are probably healthier for you.
Organic foods can be labeled in several different ways, and they’re increasingly
government regulated, so anyone who sells more than $5,000 a year worth of
organic foods must be certified. Foods marked with the USDA Organic seal
meet one of the first two criteria listed below:
 100 percent organic: Must be completely organic or made of organic
products. USDA Organic seal approved.
 Organic: Products that are 95 percent organic. USDA Organic seal
approved.
155
Chapter 7: You Are What You Eat: Nutrition 101

 Made with organic ingredients: Must contain at least 70 percent
organic ingredients
The USDA requires that all the organic foods must follow these standard
guidelines regardless of having a USDA organic stamp:
 Prohibit the use of irradiation, sewage sludge, or genetically modified
organisms in production
 Reflect National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) recommendations
concerning items on the national list of allowed synthetic and 
prohibited natural substances
 Prohibit antibiotics in organic meat and poultry
 Require 100 percent organic feed for organic livestock
Foods that are less than 70 percent organic can’t be labeled as organic. Also,
foods labeled “free range,” “hormone free,” or “natural” aren’t certified organic.
Because meat has to be completely free of any antibiotic exposure at all to be
called organic, it’s difficult to find truly organic meat.
Wash all organic fruits and vegetables before you eat them, just like commer-
cially grown produce. One concern about organic food is that it could be more
susceptible to bacterial contamination, although studies haven’t confirmed
this to be a definite risk.
Make sure you get enough H2O
What could be simpler than water? Second only to air, this element is essen-
tial to your survival. You can go for almost two months without food but only
a few days without water. In this section, we discuss why your body needs
water, why you need more as your body ages, and how water can reduce
health complications and stress on your body when you consume enough 
of it daily.
Consider these facts:
 More than two-thirds of the weight of the human body is water.
 The brain is 95 percent water.
 Your blood is 82 percent water.
 Your lungs are 90 percent water.
 Your muscles tissue contains 73 percent water.
Water is essential to regulate body temperature and transport oxygen to your
cells as well as nutrients to your organs. Water also removes waste and 
156
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

protects your joints and organs. If you take in less or lose more fluid than you
need, the end result is dehydration, the excessive loss of water from the body.
You need water to maintain the following:
 To replenish what’s lost via perspiration and respiration (breathing)
 To flush toxins
 To keep your body’s core temperature balanced
 To help keep blood circulating
You can, of course, be dehydrated if you’ve spent a long time in the heat, are
running a fever, have severe diarrhea or vomiting, have exercised strenuously,
or haven’t been drinking at all. Serious effects of dehydration include hypoten-
sion (low blood pressure), heatstroke, urinary tract infections, nausea, dry-
ness of the mouth and skin, vomiting, constipation, and reccurring headaches.
Recent studies have also linked the lack of water to arthritis, kidney stones,
and heartburn.
Most likely, if you’re drinking 6 to 8 glasses of water a day, you’re getting plenty
of hydration. As you age, however, you may experience the following, which
can lead to an increased need to stay hydrated:
 The diminished thirst mechanism: As you age you experience a reduc-
tion in your sensitivity to changes in fluid status in your body. Your
brain doesn’t tell you that you’re thirsty. This factor significantly impairs
your ability to maintain water level balance and increases your risk for
dehydration.
 Medications with a diuretic (a substance that increases the discharge
of urine water): As many people get older, they need medications that
have a diuretic side effect. If you’re on a medication like this, you may
need to increase your fluid intake. Make sure to talk to your doctor
before making any changes.
 Changes in renal physiology and anatomy: Due to a decreased size in
kidneys, blood flow to the kidneys is restricted and the kidneys function
more slowly.
So you don’t necessarily need more water as you get older — you may just
need to be more conscious of getting enough.
Deciding what to drink
Although water is the best source of replenishing your body’s fluids, there
are a variety of fluids you can drink that can still provide you with hydration
to replace your body’s daily fluid loss. There are several electrolyte drinks or
drink mixes that work, but realize that they have more calories and can con-
tain artificial sweeteners and other additives.
157
Chapter 7: You Are What You Eat: Nutrition 101

Common sense, though, says that taking in 64 ounces of a soft drink every
day isn’t going to do anything for your nutrition besides add a bunch of
“empty” calories to your daily intake.
Staying well hydrated without wasting calories — or money — is pretty
straightforward:
 Drink tap water, if yours is safe from bacteria and pollutants
 Skip regular and diet sodas, which have no nutrition whatsoever. Regular
soda is nothing but sugar and diet sodas contain artificial sweeteners.
 Substitute sugar laden 10 percent “real juice” types with real 100 percent
fruit and vegetable juices.
 Eat more fruits and veggies, which have natural high-fluid content.
 Drink lowfat or skim milk and get your calcium and calories without 
the fat.
Avoid the unpronounceable: 
Chemical additives
If the labels on the food you eat have you shaking your head over the long list
of unpronounceable ingredients, you’re not alone! There are over 14,000 man-
made chemicals added to the food supply today.
Food additives are not natural nutrition. Additives are used to preserve food’s
shelf life, add flavor, or make food look “pretty” by adding or enhancing color.
They may also keep products like mayonnaise from separating, increase bulk,
add a nice smell, or control acidity or alkalinity of certain foods.
Most additives aren’t known to be harmful, but some such as food dyes and
sulfites, are known allergens. Some additives, such as artificial sweeteners,
have been linked to increasing the cravings for simple carbs and are com-
monly consumed by people over their ideal weight. A few of the most
common additives and their possible effects are listed below:
 Acesulfame K: This additive, where the K stands for potassium, is one of
three sugar substitutes (the other two are aspartame and saccharin) sold
in packet or tablet form. It’s used to sweeten chewing gum, baked goods,
dry mixes for beverages, instant coffee and tea, gelatin desserts, puddings
and non-dairy creamers, among other things. The drug is excreted with-
out being absorbed.
158
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

 Aspartame: Equal, NutraSweet, and Canderel are just a few of the names
that aspartame is marketed under. Aspartame is found in products
worldwide and the list of foods is enormous. Some of the common prod-
ucts that you find it in are diet soft drinks, chewing gum, and as a pack-
aged sweetener.
Aspartame has been under public scrutiny for some time due to the sus-
picion of harmful side effects. In 1995, over 90 symptoms of health con-
cerns were reported by medical professionals or consumers thought to
be attached to aspartame. Some studies have concluded adverse effects
and some have not. With the emergence of other sweeteners like
sucrolose and stevia, many folks just avoid aspartame, although the
debate goes on.
 Artificial coloring: Coloring is found in everything from Cheetos to
Popsicles. Artificial coloring (there are nine FDA certified color dyes)
serves no purpose except to enhance the appearance of food. They’re
also blamed for an increase in hyperactivity in children and allergic 
reactions. But is the blame deserved?
Researchers at Columbia University and Harvard reviewed 15 previous
studies and came to the conclusion that the claims of increased hyper-
activity were inconclusive. On the other hand, occasional hives have
been reported after exposure to Red 40 and Yellow 5 dyes. As with all
artificial food products, limiting exposure is the best policy. It’s not like
most of the food colored with them have much, if any, nutritional value.
 Caffeine: This stimulant is found naturally in tea, coffee, and cocoa. It’s
also added to many soft drinks. It is one of the few drugs — a stimulant —
added to foods. Caffeine promotes stomach-acid secretion, temporarily
raises blood pressure, and dilates some blood vessels while constricting
others. Caffeine is mildly addictive, which is why some people experience
headaches when they stop drinking it. If you have high blood pressure or
are at risk for heart disease, skip the caffeine.
 Monosodium Glutamate (MSG): MSG is used as a flavor enhancer in many
foods, despite the fact that it has no flavor of its own. It may work by
stimulating certain receptors in the tongue.
A small number of people may have a sensitivity reaction called MSG
symptom complex after consuming 0.5 to 2.5 mg of MSG, especially on
an empty stomach (a typical serving of MSG in food is less than 0.5 mg).
A small percentage of asthmatics also experienced worsening asthma
symptoms after the same dose. MSG symptom complex symptoms
include headache, chest tightness, fast heartbeat, tingling, and burning
and numbness of the face and upper extremities. If you’re asthmatic or
you’ve had an MSG reaction, avoiding MSG is probably a good idea. MSG
is found in many foods and dishes,(including many Chinese dishes) so
read labels.
159
Chapter 7: You Are What You Eat: Nutrition 101

 Sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate: These two closely related chemicals
have been used for centuries to preserve meat and keep it from changing
color when heated.
• Sodium nitrite provides some protection against botulism.The main
concern with nitrites is that they can form a known animal carcino-
gen called nitrosomine when combined with gastric juices or
during the process of frying. For this reason, ascorbic acid, which
inhibits formation of nitrosomines, is added to processed meats.
Our recommendation? Limit processed meats to one or two serv-
ings a week; they contain a lot of “bad” fat anyway. Nitrites have
also been found to be triggers of migraines; migraine sufferers are
often coached to stay away from processed meats for this reason.
• Sodium nitrate is used to preserve meat. When it’s used, the bacteria
converts the sodium nitrate into nitrite, which has the preserving

Curbing unhealthy cravings
Have you ever felt like you just HAD to have a
chocolate bar or an order of salt and vinegar
potato chips? You weren’t really hungry, you
were just craving a certain something. No?
Lucky you! One survey showed that almost 100
percent of women and nearly 70 percent of men
have had food cravings during the last year. A
history of food craving is associated with exces-
sive snacking and poor diet compliance.
A study done at the University of Pennsylvania
showed that food cravings activate three
regions of the brain associated with emotion,
memory, and reward, so cravings may really be
“all in your head.” What this means is that crav-
ings are related to your emotional state and
your memories of how certain foods made you
“feel” rather than to a need for a specific food
or a dietary lack.
For most people, occasional cravings are harm-
less and won’t wreck an otherwise nutritionally
sound diet. But if your cravings are a daily (or
hourly!) event, the following suggestions may
help:
 Eat something every few hours. Letting
yourself get hungry not only leads to eating
“whatever’s handy” but also allows you
time to “think” about the foods you want,
which can activate cravings for them.
 Give in to your cravings once in a while.
Cravings don’t go away when you’re dieting
(what a shocker, eh?) so plan to “give 
in” occasionally. Diet plans like Weight
Watchers allow for this by giving you 
“anytime” points for when a craving hits 
or when you want to have a big meal or
dessert.
 Find better ways to handle stress.
According to a study done by University of
California, San Francisco, food craving may
be the body’s way of calming chronic
stress. So other ways of combating stress,
such as biofeedback, relaxation tech-
niques, and journaling, will result in fewer
pounds gained and healthier stress man-
agement techniques perfected.
 Choose lower calorie substitutes that sat-
isfy cravings without wrecking your diet
plan. Figuring out how to suppress food
cravings is an important part of long-term
weight loss success, so it’s good to be pre-
pared for cravings.

benefits stated above. Sodium nitrate isn’t often used and is
replaced with sodium nitrite.
Most meat processors have stopped using sodium nitrate over
concerns about its safety and have decreased the amount of
nitrites used to cure meat over the last twenty years.
 Saccharin: This additive is 350 times sweeter than sugar and is used in
tiny amounts in dietetic foods or as a tabletop sugar substitute. An epi-
demiology study done by the National Cancer Institute in the early 1970s
found that a high dose of artificial sweeteners (saccharin and cyclamate)
in rats was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer and was
listed as a possible carcinogen in 1981. Subsequent studies didn’t show
a connection, and in 2000 saccharin was removed from the National
Toxicology Program’s report as a carcinogen.
Occasional use of artificial sweeteners can help curb your sweet tooth,
but in the long run, anything made out of chemicals shouldn’t be part of
your regular diet.
 Sulfites: These additives are used to prevent discoloration in fruits and
veggies; they also keep bacterial growth and fermentation under control
in wine and aid in food preservation. Some people — possibly as many
as one in a hundred — are sensitive or allergic to sulfites and may have a
reaction that can range from a mile headache to life threatening breath-
ing problems. Allergies and serious reactions are more common in asth-
matics. Sulfites are no longer allowed to be used on most fresh fruits and
vegetables, but they’re found in a number of processed foods, including
beer, wine, dried fruits, baked goods, and canned vegetables. Look on
food labels for indications that the product contains sulfites: sulfur diox-
ide, potassium bisulfate, sodium bisulfate.
Reading Food Labels
Food labels have moved way outside the supermarket; everything from fast
food to restaurant menus these days contains nutritional breakdowns of 
calorie count, percentages of protein, carbs and fat, calcium and iron recom-
mended daily allowance (RDA) percentages, and much more in grams, mil-
ligrams, or percentages. There’s no excuse today for not knowing what you’re
eating!
While food labels are a great source of info, and sometimes even more than
you want to know, they do have some caveats. For one thing, the percentages
of RDA are based on a 2,000 calorie a day diet, with 60 percent of calories
coming from carbohydrates, ten percent from protein, and thirty percent
from fat, based on the average nutritional needs of a 170 pound man. If you’re
not a 170 pound man, but a 100 pound woman, the RDA percentage of, say,
fat, contained in a food may not be accurate for you. If a candy bar (just to
161
Chapter 7: You Are What You Eat: Nutrition 101

use a bad example) contains 30 percentage of the “RDA” of fat, it may actually
be more like 50 percent of your RDA of fat. If you’re on a diet higher in pro-
tein, or lower in carbs, these percentages won’t apply to you, either. So read
labels with a grain of — dare we say? — salt when it comes to the exact per-
centage, unless, of course, you’re a 170 pound man on a diet composed of 60
percent carbs.
By law, all food labels contain the following information:
 Serving size: The most important thing to remember is that the serving
size may not be the whole box, bag, or container. This fact may be obvi-
ous when you’re looking at a 20 ounce bag of chips and not so obvious
with a two-ounce bag. But if you’re eating the entire bag thinking you’re
taking in 200 calories, and then notice there are two servings in a bag,
you’ve just eaten twice as many calories as you intended.
 Servings per container or package: This information states the number
of servings in the package. Don’t forget — check this info before you
start eating!
 Calories and Calories from Fat: The calorie content is important because
excess intake can lead to weight gain. And the calories-from-fat number
is crucial to help you limit fat intake, especially saturated and trans fats.
Ideally the calories from fat should equal no more than 30 percent of the
total number of calories in a serving. For example 2 tablespoons of peanut
butter has about 210 calories and 16 grams of fat. That means 69 percent
of the calories come from fat.
 % Daily Value: This information compares the contents of the product
to the RDA based on a 2,000-calorie diet. These numbers help you judge
whether the food has enough or too much of the nutrients you need. For
example, a box of macaroni and cheese (prepared) has 48 grams of car-
bohydrates, which is 16 percent of the RDA.
 Total Fat, Carbohydrates, Protein; Cholesterol, Sodium: This part of
the label lists several important numbers. The label identifies the spe-
cific types of fat in the product (unsaturated, saturated, and trans fat)
and their amounts. No more than 10 percent of your total 30 percent
daily allowance of fat should come from saturated fats or trans fats. This
label also helps if you’re trying to track your carb and protein intake,
your daily sodium intake, or if you’re trying to cut down on cholesterol.
 Vitamins and Minerals: Percentages of RDA will also be listed on the
food label, although it may be way too small for you to read without a
magnifying glass!

 Checking out the natural values of herbs
A
s you get older, you may think that you need to take some vitamins or
supplements. You may have heard that some supplements help with
memory loss, or others give you the stamina of a 20 year old. But do you
really need to take dietary supplements to get the vitamins, minerals, and
other nutrients that you need? The answer is possibly, especially if your diet,
like many people’s, is heavy on the processed and fast foods and light on
fruits and vegetables, or if you just want to make sure you’re getting all the
nutrients you need, especially as you get older.
In this chapter, we explain why nutrient supplements may be vital to your
health, and how to find the best ones, because all supplements aren’t 
created equal. We also look at the side effects of some supplements, their
interactions with certain medications, and why it’s not a good idea to take
supplements without discussing them with your doctor first. We also probe
the preventative properties of probiotics, the good bacteria, and how you can
incorporate them into your diet.
Nutritional supplements can never take the place of food and should never be
used as a replacement for a healthy diet. Use supplements as just that — a
supplement to an already healthy diet and notify your physician any time 
you begin taking a new supplement.

Knowing Which Vitamins and Minerals
You Need (and How Much)
Vitamins and minerals are both micronutrients (substances that the body
requires only in small quantities), found in many of the foods you eat, but
these small nutritional powerhouses are important for many essential reac-
tions in the body. You need vitamins and minerals for growth and develop-
ment, particularly with vision, muscles, blood cells, teeth, and bones.
Vitamins and minerals sound pretty similar, but they’re very different; in 
this section, we look at vitamins first.
Vitamins
Vitamins are organic, which means that they come from plants and animals;
they’re found in food but can also be obtained from supplements. Vitamins
fall into two categories:
 Water soluble: With these vitamins, excess amounts are washed out in
your body fluids. You need to take in adequate amounts of water-soluble
vitamins every day because your body doesn’t store them.
 Fat soluble: These vitamins are stored in the body’s fat tissue and liver
for a few days to several months to be used when needed.
Be careful not to overdo fat-soluble vitamins, because large amounts can
be harmful if they build up in your tissues, leading to hypervitaminosis
(excess vitamins in the body with potentially dangerous toxicity).
There’s no definitive level of vitamin intake that will absolutely lead to
toxic levels, so it’s very important to stick to the recommended guide-
lines for fat-soluble vitamin intake.
You don’t need to read the tiny print on the multivitamin bottle to know what
the daily dosages of different vitamins should be. To make it easy, the FDA
has created a handy table of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of the
most common vitamins — see Table 8-1.

Minerals
Minerals differ from vitamins in that, unlike vitamins, the body can’t make
any minerals. Your body relies completely on external sources, like food and
supplements, for your minerals. In addition, minerals are inorganic, which
means that they come from the soil and water that animals and plants ingest.
(Or absorb, in the case of plants.) Some minerals are routinely added to cer-
tain foods; the iodine added to salt is one example. See Table 8-2 for your
daily mineral needs.
Not all minerals are beneficial. Some minerals, like lead, are contaminant min-
erals and not nutrients; they can cause harm by disrupting rather than help-
ing normal body functions.

Deciding Whether You Need 
to Supplement Your Diet
If you’re looking to get the best nutritional bang for your buck, get your vita-
mins and minerals from food rather than pills, because more nutrients are
absorbed from food than from supplements. From a nutritional standpoint, if
you eat a well-balanced, healthy diet, you won’t need much, if anything, in the
area of supplements (see Chapter 7 for more information on a healthy diet).
Supplements should never be used as meal replacement and need only be
used if your diet is deficient.
At certain times in your life, supplementation is a good idea — some medical
conditions can benefit from adding vitamin and mineral supplements. Folic
acid for women who are pregnant or thinking of pregnancy has been shown
to reduce neural tube defects (a birth defect involving the brain and/or spinal
cord). Vegetarians should consider taking vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium,
and iron, which are found predominantly in meat and dairy products. In the
next sections, we look at factors that can help you decide whether or not to
supplement your diet.

Vitamins and minerals in the news
Some vitamins and minerals get more press
than others. Here are a few related to aging that
have been in the news recently and the latest
findings about their use:
 Vitamin E: Vitamin E has drawn some bad
press lately. Long touted as an antioxidant
that boosted the immune system and pro-
tected against cardiac disease, vitamin E
took a hit when a recent research project
done at Johns Hopkins University showed
that people who took vitamin E in amounts
larger than 400 IU daily were more likely to
die of any cause than people who didn’t.
With this new information, vitamin E sup-
plements are no longer recommended.
 Vitamin D: Recently, a number of reports
say that people who live in climates where
sun exposure is limited for a good part of
the year have serious vitamin D deficien-
cies. If you live in a cold climate, vitamin D
supplementation should be part of your
daily intake, especially as you get older; vit-
amin D is essential for strong bones and
aids in calcium absorption.
 Vitamin A: Vitamin A has been in the news
lately for two reasons; some studies have
shown that one form of vitamin A, retinol,
may increase the risk of osteoporosis in
high doses (over 5,000 IU). You should look
for a multivitamin where the dose of vitamin
A is less than 2,500 IU, or one where half of
the vitamin A present comes from the
second form of vitamin A, beta carotene.
However, beta carotene also has risk fac-
tors. Some studies have indicated that beta
carotene may increase the chance of
developing lung cancer in smokers and
should be avoided. If you smoke, choose a
vitamin with less than 2,500 IU of retinol and
no beta carotene.
 Calcium: Your body contains more calcium
than any other mineral, and 99 percent of
your calcium is found in your teeth and
bones. Calcium is essential for good bone
density. It’s impossible to get enough cal-
cium from a daily multivitamin; you need
between 1,000–1,200 mg daily, and a multi-
vitamin containing that much calcium
would be too big to swallow. Your body also
can absorb only about 500 mg of calcium at
one time, so you need to take supplements
preferably three times a day, with food, to
get maximum absorption.
 Iron: After age 50, you should take a sup-
plement that doesn’t contain any iron,
because after menopause, women are no
longer losing blood on a monthly basis
(which can lower your iron count), and most
men get enough iron from their diet. Too
much iron can be harmful because the body
doesn’t excrete much iron; toxic levels can
occur when iron accumulates. Take iron
only if your physician prescribes it; iron sup-
plements should be kept out of the reach of
children because death can occur with
small ingestions.
 AREDs vitamin preparations: Age-related
eye disease (ARED) vitamin preparations
are recommended for people with age-
related macular degeneration (ARMD) or
those with a family history of the disease.
Studies found that the ARED preparations
reduced the incidence of developing ARMD
by around 25 percent.
There are two ARED formulas: one contains
beta carotene, the other doesn’t. Smokers
should take the formulary without beta
carotene. Other ingredients in the ARED for-
mulas are zinc, vitamin E, vitamin A, and
copper.

Taking stock of your lifestyle
If you have the food pyramid shellacked onto the front of your refrigerator
and follow it religiously every day, you probably get all the essential nutrients
you need. People who grow their own vegetables, buy all their fruit at a local
stand, raise their own free-range chickens, and have never been inside a fast
food restaurant probably don’t need to take vitamin supplements. However,
this doesn’t apply to most people today; research shows that people in the
industrialized world eat fast food twice a week and that one-third of American
children may eat fast food daily.
The problem with fast foods (including the frozen kind, the shelved kind, and
the drive-up kind) is that most of them have been processed in some way in
order to preserve them for longer shelf life, or to make them taste better.
True, processing is good in some ways: It allows food to be kept longer with-
out spoiling, kills dangerous bacteria like salmonella, and lets you eat fruits
and vegetables out of season. Food processing additives also make food taste
better by adding salt and flavor enhancers. The caveat? The price you pay for
stronger flavors includes more salt and unhealthy fats, not to mention that
processing strips food of essential nutrients. Even cooking is considered a
form of food processing that can disturb the balance of nutrients because
exposure to high temperatures, light, and oxygen causes the greatest amount
of nutrient loss.
One way to avoid processed food is to eat more raw foods. It would be won-
derful, nutritionally speaking, if more people jumped on this bandwagon, but
many folks don’t care for raw vegetables unadorned with butter or salt and
don’t want to take the time to wash and peel fresh fruits and veggies. Many
have chosen to replace the nutrient loss with vitamin and mineral supple-
ments, which we strongly advise against. The best source of vitamins and
minerals is still from foods; however, getting vitamins indirectly is still better
than not getting them at all.
So what’s a person to do? Our suggestion is to adhere to a healthy diet and
take supplemental vitamins or minerals only if you really need them. The
bottom line is that if you’re eating a well-balanced diet and have no medical
conditions that may be affecting your nutritional balance, you can save some
money by not taking extra vitamins that your body doesn’t need. However, if
you eat mainly processed foods or absolutely can’t eat the recommended
intake of fresh fruits and vegetables (see Chapter 7), and if you do have med-
ical conditions that affect your body’s ability to absorb nutrients, you may
want to take nutritional supplements. Also consider your habits; if you smoke
or consume alcohol, you may want to take supplements, because tobacco
and alcohol have been found to affect nutrient absorption of vitamin C, B1,
zinc, and iron. Talk to your doctor if you feel that a supplement may be the
right choice for you.
169
Chapter 8: Supplementing Your Daily Diet

Getting your doctor involved
Sometimes, supplementation isn’t beneficial and could be harmful, particularly
if you have existing medical conditions or are taking prescription or over-the-
counter medications. (Vitamins can interfere with some medications and can
have toxic effects if taken in too-large of quantities; too much chromium pic-
colinate, for example, can result in kidney failure, according to some reports.)
Therefore, you should always discuss your interest in supplements with your
doctor to make sure that nothing in your medical history makes taking certain
supplements unwise for you.
Many supplements are available on the market and new ones always pop up
on the horizon, but most people simply look for a quality daily vitamin. A
well-balanced multivitamin is a sensible choice when you’re not sure exactly
what your body needs — it may not be sufficient, though, if you have specific
deficiencies. Some multivitamins contain some vitamins with higher
strengths. Some supplements are manufactured and marketed for specific
groups categorized by age, gender, and medical conditions. Your doctor
should help guide you toward supplements that may benefit any medical con-
ditions you have or be appropriate for your age and gender. Basically, a 25-
year-old male needs a different supplement list than a 55-year-old female with
killer hot flashes!
Another important consideration is the brand and form (liquid, capsule, or
pill) of supplement you’ll take. You can choose from many brands of supple-
ments, and not all are created equally; your doctor can help you navigate the
vitamin-laden shelves.
170
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 
Poor soil quality, poor food (and nutrient) quality?
Depending on which journals or magazine arti-
cles you read, the soil food is grown in is
becoming depleted. Despite persuasive argu-
ments and studies on both sides, no certain
proof exists that food today is less nutritious
than what was grown 100 years ago, though
some researchers claim otherwise.
Most plants grow by absorbing nutrients from
the soil. Soil quality is important and is the foun-
dation for the development of nutritious pro-
duce. Depending on where in the world the soil
is located, fertile soil contains some combina-
tion of sand, silt, clay, and organic matter. The
consistency of a soil (soil texture) and its 
acidity (pH) determine the extent to which nutri-
ents are available to plants.
Studies of forests in New England have shown
a decrease in calcium and magnesium in the
soil on the forest floor, most likely due to acid
rain. Other potential culprits for soil depletion
are the overuse of fertilizers and overfarming
without letting the land recover between crops.
At this point, it’s hard to say whether this prob-
lem is serious; many studies are being con-
ducted to either verify or deny allegations that
food isn’t as nutritious today as it once was.
Taking supplements may give you peace of mind
about what your food may be missing.

The Absorption Factor: Comparing
Supplements
What’s in your waste treatment plant? It seems that one of the things that’s
“left behind”, so to speak, is remnants of undigested pill casings, tablet fillers,
and binders from the medications and supplements people ingest. So how
much of your expensive supplement is actually ending up in the toilet? While
it’s a lot simpler to just grab the nearest inexpensive bottle of vitamins off the
shelf or maybe the ones with the prettiest label, it’s not the smartest way to
choose your supplement. In the world of vitamins, marketing ploys of supple-
ments promise to be the next big medical breakthrough, but make sure that
you take time to become an educated consumer.
It may be helpful to know a few terms and basic components of supplement
manufacturing before you start digging through the rows of bottles in the
health food store. If you settle for a supplement that doesn’t supply exactly
what you need in the way you need it, not only will it fail to benefit your
health, but it will also be a waste of money. Understanding the different ways
that supplements are manufactured and designed to deliver the vitamins and
minerals helps you make more educated decisions when looking to purchase.
The importance of supplement form
Clearly, you can’t sit at home and receive all your nutritional needs from an
IV hung overhead while watching your favorite TV show — at least, not yet!
You need to choose between liquids, capsules, or tablets. Learning how sup-
plements are made and what maximizes absorption can help you choose.
Vitamin supplements come in many forms. Fortunately, discovering new or
improved methods of getting vitamins into your cells quickly is a vital goal 
of nutritional manufacturing companies, and those methods largely relate to
form. The term for this characteristic is bioavailability, which is the rate at
which a substance is absorbed and made available to your body. It’s affected
by how quickly a supplement dissolves and is absorbed in the gastrointesti-
nal system (mostly the stomach and small intestine); substances that need to
be broken down the least are absorbed fastest.
Here are some key factors to keep in mind regarding supplement forms:
 Tablets: This form is the most common one. According to the Physicians
Desk Reference, only about 3 to 10 percent of the vitamins in pill or tablet
form actually make it throughout your body and enter the bloodstream.
Tablets have the slowest rate of bioavailability.
171
Chapter 8: Supplementing Your Daily Diet

 Capsules: Capsules are coated with a substance that makes them easier
to swallow than traditional tablets. Gel-form capsules also digest more
quickly than powder-form capsules, and in general, capsules have a
better bioavailability than tablets but less than liquids.
 Liquid: Liquids are quickly absorbed into your bloodstream because they
don’t have to be broken down — and they’re much easier to swallow! As
such, they have the fastest rate of bioavailability of all the over-the-
counter forms.
The differences among brands
Should you care which supplement you spend your money on? After all, toss-
ing the closest supplement in your shopping cart is easier than reading the
labels to make sure that you’re getting your money’s worth. And isn’t the gov-
ernment looking after you by regulating all the supplements on the shelf?
If you aren’t familiar with the actual regulations that control supplement pro-
duction — and not too many people are — you can get to know them (see the
nearby sidebar “The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994
(DSHEA)” to find out what those regulations are). Supplements don’t have to
meet the same high standards that food and conventional medications do,
although this regulation is changing and becoming more stringent.
Unfortunately, you’ll rarely find a supplement that is simply the intended active
ingredient without the addition of some inactive substances that help mold
the supplement to the right size, shape, and color and aid in its dissolving.
Some of the added substances can also negatively affect the way you digest
and absorb the supplements. Consider the following:
 Filler: One area where supplements differ greatly is in the filler they use.
Some filler is necessary to take up space, but fillers are nothing more for
the supplement than volume. However, some fillers are better than others
for absorption, and some companies use more filler than needed to give
the appearance of a larger quantity.
 Disintegrant: Disintegrants help dissolve a tablet after you swallow it.
Some of the popular disintegrants are gellan gum, crospovidone, and
croscarmellose sodium.
 Binder: In tablets, binders are mixed with fillers to stick to the compo-
nents of the tablet during compression. Some common binders are starch,
cellulose, povidone, and xanthan gum.
 Flavor: Flavoring is added to add a pleasant taste — or to disguise a bad
taste! A few other things you can do without are added sugar, salt, or
starch — a vitamin isn’t something you’re having for lunch!

Chapter 8: Supplementing Your Daily Diet
Nutraceuticals: The future form of supplements?
The development of high-standard nutraceuti-
cals is an exciting and evolving field focused on
providing nutrients with proven medical bene-
fits with better concentrations and absorption
rates. But what are nutraceuticals?
According to the FDA, a nutraceutical is any
substance that has additional medical or health
benefits beyond general nutrition and can
include vitamins, minerals, herbs, foods, and
supplements. This broad definition leaves much
room for interpretation and confusion, and
many products may call themselves nutraceu-
ticals, but they don’t really fit the bill.
Nutraceuticals can be pills, capsules, liquids,
juice, or just about any form that combines a
food product with a medical benefit. Many sup-
plements are also nutraceuticals, but many are
not. The key to nutraceuticals is that research-
supported proof shows that they have medical
benefit.
Nutraceuticals aim to counteract the effects 
of stress and free radicals by boosting your
body’s immune system and reducing specific
health risks. Research has proven that you can
slow down various components of early aging
by using the right combination of vitamins, 
minerals, and antioxidants contained in
nutraceuticals.
Furthermore, with insurance premiums contin-
uing to rise, the uninsured population will
increase, leaving a large portion of consumers
looking for ways to improve health and
decrease the potential for costly medical care.
As the quest for good health continues, phar-
maceutical-grade supplements are becoming
more mainstream and highly popular because
they provide people with what they’re looking
for — the right nutrients that the body can 
readily absorb and utilize quickly in a delivery
system with minimal wasted product through
poor digestion and absorption.
Currently, nutraceuticals aren’t required to fol-
low pharmaceutical-grade standards because 
of their dietary supplement classification.
Nutraceutical manufacturers are required to
adhere only to the regulations set forth under
the Dietary Supplement Health and Education
Act. Despite having few regulations, some of
the nutraceutical companies are setting high
standards for quality products. However, as a
result of less stringent requirement practices
of dietary supplement manufacturers, some
nutraceutical manufactures have made exag-
gerated or false claims (as always, if it sounds
too good to be true, it probably is). How-
ever, there are reputable manufacturers of
quality nutraceutical products available. Eniva
Corporation is one of the companies setting the
pace for standards and quality in the nutraceu-
tical industry with a long line of products
including their best seller, VIBE. Amerisciences
is another company with a full range of prod-
ucts and, along with Eniva, uses manufacturing
standards as high as many pharmaceutical
companies in their product development and
research. Other supplement companies will be
looking to improve their standards and even
major pharmaceutical companies have been
looking to get into the arena of nutraceuticals
due to consumer demand.
Warning: Nutraceuticals, like all supplements,
need to be treated as medicine, because they
could interact with some prescription medica-
tions, or even other nutraceutical products.
Discuss with your doctor before you take any
nutraceutical products.

 Colorant: Colors are added to tablets to make telling them apart easier
and so that they look more appealing. One thing you absolutely, posi-
tively have no use for in a multivitamin or supplement is artificial 
coloring. Vitamins don’t need to be pretty to be effective.
To ensure that you’re taking a supplement of the highest quality, look for a
USP (United States Pharmacopoeia) or BP (British Pharmacopoeia) designa-
tion on the label.
To make things easier on you, Web sites such as www.consumerlab.com
have tested supplements and can provide you with lists of the ones that
don’t contain the amounts of the ingredients that they claim to have or those
that have too many fillers or binders to be beneficial.
Adding a Pinch of Good 
Bacteria: Probiotics
Bacteria aren’t always a bad thing. Although you may associate bacteria with
infections, your intestines play host to a number of bacteria considered to be
“good” or even necessary. Probiotics (the name comes from a Greek word
meaning for life) are good bacteria that help keep the body in proper balance.
Good bacteria in the intestines carry out a number of functions:
 Assist in breaking down food so you can absorb the nutrients
 Help maintain proper pH levels in your body
 Create antibodies that help support your immune system
Problems occur when the bad bacteria start to take over, overwhelming the
good bacteria. The resulting imbalance can cause symptoms such as intesti-
nal distress (excessive gas, bloating, and constipation), urinary tract infections,
or yeast infections for women.
The most common and well-known cause of bad bacteria overgrowth is the
use of antibiotics; many women are familiar with the yeast infections that
result when they take antibiotics. Diseases like Crohn’s disease and diverticu-
losis, which slow muscular activity in the intestine, also allow bad bacteria to
multiply.
It’s also possible that parasites, mold, viruses, chlorinated drinking water,
alcohol, and a high-sugar intake can contribute to bacterial overgrowth. One
way to correct the problem is to get more good bacteria into your intestines
by consuming probiotics.

Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

The importance and function of probiotics
Clinical studies have shown that probiotic supplements improve your ability
to fight off intestinal infections and also help you digest your food better. But
those aren’t the only positive effect probiotics can have. For example, 
probiotics
 Aid in digestion and absorption: Probiotics are necessary for manufac-
turing the B vitamins, biotin, and folic acid, which aid in food absorption,
as well as antioxidants and iron from your diet. They remove the harmful
toxins you ingest in your foods (like pesticides) and assist in the removal
of digestive waste products.
 Slow down the growth of bad bacteria that cause upset stomach: When
bad bacteria multiplies in the intestines, things get “backed up” causing
gas, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation, and nutrient absorption is
inhibited. Taking probiotics can help restore the balance of your intesti-
nal tract and calm down “tummy troubles” and traveler’s diarrhea.
 Reduce food intolerance: Probiotics can help you digest lactose or gluten
if you’re lactose or gluten intolerant.
 Stimulate the immune system: Probiotics produce natural antibiotics,
which can help fight off harmful bacteria such as salmonella, E. coli, and
shigella.

Chapter 8: Supplementing Your Daily Diet
Getting a personalized multivitamin
If you’re looking for something designed for
your specific needs, ask your doctor about a
growing trend in personalized healthcare called
individual vitamin compounding. In this process,
your doctor takes blood or hair samples and
sends them to a lab for analysis. The generated
report tells you exactly what your body needs,
detailing your vitamin and mineral deficiencies
as well as any you have in abundance. Your
doctor takes this information, and in conjunction
with a compounding pharmacy or supplement
manufacturer, provides you with an individually
prepared supplement with the vitamins and
mineral quantities tailored to your body’s spe-
cific needs.
This type is more expensive than your off-the-
shelf-brands, but it can be less expensive than
taking several different vitamins. If you want
something tailored specifically to your needs,
neither too much nor too little of certain nutri-
ents, it’s well worth it. Insurance companies still
haven’t cooperated in helping out with vitamin
supplements, but don’t let them dictate your
health. Hopefully insurance companies will
eventually agree that choosing a supplement
based on deficiencies should be classified as a
medical need.

 Support urinary tract health: Women are more susceptible than men to
contracting urinary tract infections (UTIs). Because a woman’s urethra
is much shorter than a man’s, the bacteria has a much shorter distance
to travel to cause an infection. A UTI or cystitis occurs when bacteria
coming from normal intestinal flora makes its way into the bladder.
Replenishing the intestines with probiotics helps restore the balance.
 Support vaginal health: The vagina and its normal, healthy microflora
(microbiota) form a finely balanced ecosystem. Disruption of this ecosys-
tem can lead to bacterial vaginosis (BV, an overgrowth of bacteria or
yeast that causes unwanted symptoms, such as vaginal itching, a fishy
odor, discharge, and discomfort), which is one of the most common
vaginal infections. Replenishing the vagina with probiotics helps restore
the balance.
The two main probiotics 
(and where to get them)
The two primary types of bacteria — lactobacilli and bifidobacteria — help
maintain a healthy balance of intestinal flora:
 Lactobacillus: This bacteria breaks down protein, carbohydrates, and
fats in your food. In the process, it produces lactic acid. Many forms of
bacteria and yeast (like Candida albicans) don’t get along well with lactic
acid. Lactobacillus maintains the ratio of good to bad bacteria by creat-
ing its own antibiotics (acidophilin, lactocidin, and acidolin) to keep toxic
bacteria — such as E. coli, Helicobacter pylori, and clostridia — at bay.
Lactobacillus also produces B vitamins and butyric acid, which help you
absorb nutrients from food, and is especially helpful in absorbing lactose
products. Most of all, lactobacillus reduces your chances of developing
diarrhea, constipation, gas, and bloating.
 Bifidobacteria: This probiotic is the most common probiotic in the large
intestine. Often called bifidus, bifidobacteria aids in digestion, fights
infection, reduces severe diarrhea commonly associated with rotavirus,
and is associated with a lower incidence of allergies. These bacteria are
also important in the production of B vitamins.
These two primary bacteria have several forms, and you can find the most
common ones in the following foods:
 Sweet acidophilus milk: Sweet acidophilus milk has lactobacillus aci-
dophilus added but isn’t fermented, so it doesn’t have the acidity and
flavor people associated with fermented products.
176
Part III: Using Nutrition to Extend Your Expiration Date 

 Fermented yogurt: Yogurt is a semi-solid fermented milk product that
must be marked as made with live cultures to be considered probiotic.
Fermented yogurt is also made into drinks.
 Miso soup: Use warm water only, because boiling water can destroy the
good bacteria.
 Pickles: Must be naturally fermented without vinegar.
 Sauerkraut: Must be raw, non-pasteurized, not canned; no vinegar used
in processing.
In addition to finding probiotics in food, you can purchase supplements over
the counter in most health food stores, pharmacies, and grocery stores. They
come in a variety of forms, including capsules, liquids, and tablets.
Preparations made specifically for infants and children contain targeted bac-
teria at lower counts. If manufactured carefully and stored properly, probiotic
bacteria can remain viable in dried format and reach your intestines alive
when you consume them.
One criticism of probiotics sold over the counter is that they may not contain
enough bacteria to actually do any good, so always look for the supplement
with the highest number of bacteria. According to one study, a minimum of
one billion live cells of lactic acid bacteria is required to do any good, and the
product shouldn’t require refrigeration, because refrigerated products may
not be stable at room temperature.
People who take immunosuppressive medication should not take probiotics,
because they may cause serious infection in the immunosuppressed.
Using Herbs and Plants 
for Health and Healing
Hundreds of years before you picked up your medications at the local drive-
though pharmacy, people were trying herbs and other plants as cures for var-
ious illnesses. Many medicines had their basis in plants, and here are a few:
 Foxglove plant: This plant is the origin of digitalis, which is used to treat
heart conditions.
 Aloe vera: This plant is an ingredient found in many ointments today
and has anesthetic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties.
 Rosemary: This herb can increase circulation, relieve headaches, and
help fight infections.
177
Chapter 8: Supplementing Your Daily Diet

Herbal products available today still may use the leaves, flowers, stems,
berries, and roots of plants to prevent and treat illness. However, while some
herbs may have restorative properties, many can be downright dangerous if
you mix them with prescription medications. One known interaction between
herbs and prescription medicine occurs with birth control pills. Some of the
herbs to avoid while using birth control include chasteberry, red clover, black
cohosh, St. John’s wort, licorice, hops, dong quai, and wild yam. Most of these
herbs contain natural estrogens that can interfere with the body’s hormonal
regulation and therefore with birth control pills. Discuss with your doctor all
the herbs that you’re taking or planning to take so that any potential interac-
tions can be addressed.
The FDA regulations for dietary supplements (including herbal remedies) are
much different from the regulations of prescription meds. Although many of
today’s prescriptions contain botanicals (plant life), they’re synthesized in
large laboratories, and they adhere to standards and guidelines specifically
designed for pharmaceutical manufacturing. This lack of regulation explains
why the same herbal remedy from one manufacturer may not have the same
effect as one produced by another.

tions or interactions you must heed if you’re taking any medications.

t’s a sad story, but the vast majority of folks nowadays are on the fast track
to fat like a runaway freight train in a summer blockbuster movie. The sad-
dest part isn’t so much the daily discomfort and inconvenience as it’s the
cumulative effects of lugging around those extra lipids. That added weight can
actually take years off your life and possibly plague your days with illness and
disease. We guarantee that membership to this club has more drawbacks than
bonuses.
So what’s a person to do? The good news is that obesity-related diseases and
illnesses are preventable for the vast majority of people if they just lose the
excess pounds and maintain a healthy body weight — this is also an excellent
way to add healthy years to your life. And contrary to popular assumption,
very few people actually have a genetic predisposition to weight gain because
of variations in hormones and metabolism. This means that you have hope,
although the sooner you act, the better. The solution is simple, but we agree
with you: It sure ain’t easy sometimes.
Please don’t sigh and flip to the next chapter. In this chapter we arm you with
a lot of information so you understand how your weight affects your overall
health and life expectancy, and we take you through the process of reaching
your fitness goals even when they seem overwhelming (minus all the fad diets
and overhyped weight-loss strategies, of course!). So join us for the ride — we
promise that you’ll find it well worth your effort in the long run.

Understanding Healthy Body Weight
Determining your “perfect” weight from a table can be difficult for the simple
reason that everybody is different. Some people have bigger bone structures,
more muscle mass, and/or carry weight in different areas of the body. These
variations in people’s frames make using any tool that categorizes someone
as overweight or obese difficult.
Your ideal body weight is the eventual weight that your body adjusts to when
you have a consistently healthy approach to eating and exercise. Your body
wants to naturally maintain this weight based on your physiologic makeup. It
may take some time to determine this number if you have weight to lose or if
you’re underweight now.
The most common method for determining your ideal weight is the body mass
index (BMI), a mathematical calculation of a person’s ideal mass (weight)
based on his or her height and weight. Don’t confuse BMI with BMR (basal
metabolic rate), which is the amount of energy used while at rest and is dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
The BMI doesn’t discriminate between muscle, fat, or bone. People who know
that they’re at their ideal weight based on their nutrition and other fat mea-
surements can and should ignore the BMI; if you have a greater amount of
muscle than most people, this generalized calculation isn’t going to apply 
to you.
In general, however, a person’s BMI score is a relatively good tool for people
between the ages of 18 and 65. It isn’t accurate for pregnant women, weight-
lifters, competitive athletes (their extra muscle adds extra weight even though
they aren’t overweight), or people with various chronic illnesses (they can
suffer from muscle wasting and malnutrition).
Calculating body mass
Figuring out your body mass index sounds like an exercise in quantum physics,
but don’t despair; plenty of online tables do the work of calculating your BMI
for you, given your height and weight. However, if you’re the mathematical
type who wants to check your figures against the tables, you can figure out
your BMI in either pounds and inches or kilograms and meters:
 Pounds and inches: Calculate BMI by dividing weight in pounds (lbs) by
height in inches (in) squared, and multiplying by a conversion factor 
of 703.
186
Part IV: Getting Physical 

Weight (lb) ÷ [height (in)]2 × 703
Example: Weight = 170 lbs, Height = 6' (72")
Calculation: [170 ÷ (72)2] × 703 = 23.05
 Kilograms and meters: You can calculate the BMI using the metric
system by using weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in meters
(m) squared. Most often the height is measured in centimeters, so you
have to convert the centimeters (cm) to meters by dividing the height
by 100.
Weight (kg) ÷ [height (m)]2
Example: Weight = 70 kg, Height = 183 cm (1.83 m)
Calculation: 70 ÷ (1.83)2 = 20.10
Recognizing unhealthy body mass
By BMI standards, people with a body mass index of less than 18.5 are under-
weight, and those with a BMI of 20 to 25 are within range of their ideal body
weight. For the most part, the higher the BMI, the higher the associated
health risks. If your BMI goes over 25, you’re creeping into the dreaded “over-
weight” category. Following is a breakdown of the categories of BMIs that are
outside the ideal range:
 Underweight: A person with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 or less is
considered underweight. Just as with being overweight, the BMI is a tool
and having a low BMI may not mean that you’re unhealthy. Often under-
weight individuals are perfectly healthy. If you experience any symptoms
such as fatigue, thinning hair or nails, irregularity in periods (women),
continuous weight loss, abdominal pains, or any other symptoms, see
your doctor for further evaluation.
 Overweight: A person with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9.
Approximately 127 million adults (or 60.5 percent) in the U.S. are 
overweight. About 1 billion people in the world are overweight.
Childhood obesity is already an epidemic in several countries and
becoming one in many others. About 22 million children under the age
of five are overweight, while obesity among children ages 6 to 11 has
doubled since 1960.
 Obese: A person with a BMI of 30 to 39.9. About 60 million adults (or 25
percent) in the U.S. are obese and 300 million obese adults exist world-
wide. This number doesn’t include children — one of the fastest growing
obesity groups.
187
Chapter 9: Maintaining a Healthy Weight and Fitness Level

 Morbidly obese: A person 100 pounds over his normal weight or with a
BMI of 40 or more. In the U.S., 9 million adults (or 5 percent) are morbidly
obese. This group has a definite increase in obesity-related illness and
mortality. The good news is that people in this BMI category can lose the
weight, just like the people in the other weight categories. Get motivated
and consult your physician to get a weight loss plan.
The Tolls of Extra Weight
Being just “a little bit overweight” doesn’t mean that you can sit back and feel
safe from the serious health concerns associated with being overweight. The
most important fact we want you to take away from this chapter is that if
you’re even a little overweight, you are just that — over your healthy 
weight — and you should try to get down to a healthy weight.
The majority of researchers feel that being overweight shares the same health
risks as being obese. It’s easy, especially in today’s overweight world, to ignore
a little extra weight, especially if you’re the thinnest one in your family or in
your circle of friends. But this tendency can give you a false sense of comfort
that can be dangerous to your health.
From a health-risk standpoint, there are only three categories: underweight,
healthy weight, and overweight. You can have disease at any weight, and
being underweight can be a serious health concern if associated with weight
loss from bulimia or anorexia. The majority of weight-related disease, and the
fastest-growing weight sector, is related to the overweight category.
Most people aren’t aware of the range of medical conditions directly associ-
ated with being overweight or obese — from the mildly unpleasant heartburn
to death from stroke or heart disease. Yes, it’s that serious. According to the
Journal of the American Medical Association, obesity is the second-leading
cause of preventable death in the U.S., right after smoking. The heavier a
person is, the less mobile he becomes, which then leads to a more detrimen-
tal, sedentary lifestyle. Weight gain and poor nutrition precipitate lack of
exercise and becoming sedentary, which then increases risk for illness and
disease — it’s a vicious cycle.
Approximately 30 illnesses and diseases are linked to being overweight. The
following represent only a handful of these medical conditions:
 Arthritis: Pain, stiffness, and loss of mobility of the hands, hips, back,
and especially the knees are worse in people with a BMI of 25 or greater.
The joints are put under a greater load of pressure that makes osteoarthri-
tis (OA) more prevalent in obese people. Losing just 10 to 15 pounds is
likely to relieve symptoms and delay disease progression.
188
Part IV: Getting Physical 

 Cardiovascular disease: Obesity (BMI of 30 or more) increases a person’s
risk for heart disease due to its effect on blood lipid levels. The American
Heart Association recognizes obesity as a major risk factor for heart
attack. Weight loss helps blood lipid levels by lowering triglycerides and
LDL (lousy) cholesterol and increasing HDL (healthy) cholesterol.
 Diabetes (type 2, adult onset, non-insulin-dependent diabetes): The
number of type 2 diabetics keeps increasing annually. As many as 90 per-
cent of individuals with type 2 diabetes are reported to be overweight or
obese. If you’re overweight, losing as little as 5 percent of your body
weight can reduce your high blood sugar.
 High blood pressure: More than 75 percent of high blood pressure cases
are reported to be directly attributed to being overweight. For more on
this subject, check out High Blood Pressure For Dummies, 2nd Edition
(Wiley) by Alan L. Rubin, MD.
 Sleep apnea: Between 60 and 70 percent of people who have sleep apnea
(they temporarily stop breathing while they sleep) are obese. Obesity is
the largest risk factor for developing this condition.
 Strokes: People with a BMI over 25 increase their risk of ischemic stroke
(from fatty deposits that obstruct blood vessels to the brain). Being
overweight or obesity is associated with high cholesterol leading to ath-
erosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries). Atherosclerosis is a direct risk
factor for strokes.
In addition to those direct links, consider the following facts:
 National Cancer Institute experts concluded that obesity is associated
with cancers of the colon, breast (postmenopausal), endometrium (the
lining of the uterus), kidney, and esophagus.
 Forty-two percent of those diagnosed with breast and colon cancers are
obese.
 Of all gallbladder surgery, 30 percent is related to obesity.
The good news is that being over your ideal weight isn’t a disease with no
cure, but rather a condition with multiple cures. Keep reading and see that
achieving a healthy weight is something that’s very attainable.
The government started recording life expectancy in 1900. The current obe-
sity epidemic may well lead to the first downward turn in those numbers in
the future. The New England Journal of Medicine already projects that obe-
sity will decrease life expectancy by close to a year; other researchers see life
expectancy numbers dropping by as much as five years in the near future.

Assessing Your Current Level of Health
No one ever said losing weight was easy. Okay, maybe some people say 
that, but they’re usually people who have never had any weight to lose!
Listing what you have to do to lose weight is easy; finding the right combina-
tion of what works for you can end up being a lifelong pursuit. It’s an all out
tug of war, with your body fighting to hang on to every pound. The more you
fight with your body, the more your body’s going to win.
So, where do you begin? You may be mentally ready to take on the battle, but
how do you know whether you’re physically ready and able to begin a serious
weight-loss and exercise program? This section tells you how to get ready for
the battle of the bulge — check in with your physician before checking in at the
gym. We also look at what you need to know about your own health before you
can tailor those workouts to be beneficial and safe. Finally, we cover your cur-
rent weight and your goal weight to give you a good idea of the road ahead.
Evaluating your fitness level
Before beginning an exercise routine, ask yourself, “What’s my baseline fitness
level?” Translation: How active are you? Are you overweight? Do you exercise
now? How many minutes a week do you exercise? Do you lift weights or do
aerobic exercise? These questions give you, your doctor, and/or your personal
trainer an idea of what your basic fitness level is.
The best personal fitness assessment comes from a personal trainer. Some
gyms include the cost of an assessment as part of your membership, although
others don’t. You may also want to contact a local personal trainer specifically
for this service.
Here are some elements the test may include:
 Exercise history: What type of exercise have you done in the last year?
Walked to the mailbox at the end of the street? Or ran a half-marathon?
Someone who’s starting a fitness program for the first time is very differ-
ent from someone who’s just taken a 6-month hiatus after a long history
of routine exercise.
 Height and weight: You may feel that we’re beating this to death, but
the quick and easy way to assess your body weight is the BMI. See the
section “Calculating body mass,” earlier in this chapter, to figure out
how to calculate your BMI.
 Body composition: This element is much more pertinent to the experi-
enced exerciser than the beginner. Some people can use a more detailed
breakdown of their body, but, for the majority, a basic BMI (see the pre-
vious bullet) works fine initially.
190
Part IV: Getting Physical 

 Resting heart rate: This number is important to know when figuring out
your target heart rate during exercise.
 Resting blood pressure: Everyone starting an exercise program needs
to check his or her blood pressure. Exercise can help lower blood pres-
sure if elevated, but you need to have a medical doctor evaluate and
manage any elevations prior to beginning an exercise routine. If your
blood pressure is normal, you can monitor it yourself; many personal
trainers also monitor blood pressure.
 Flexibility test: You don’t want to hurt yourself and end up in worse
health than when you started! Look at your range of motion and evalu-
ate muscle weakness and tightness to avoid injury.
 Strength and endurance testing: This one tests muscle strength and the
amount of time it takes to reach muscle fatigue. Having areas of the body
that are weaker may cause problems with balance and posture.
 Post-test consultation and goal setting: Understanding your overall fit-
ness level and areas of concern or concentration helps you observe
your progress (or lack thereof). Setting goals keeps you on track and
allows you to monitor incremental improvements.
At the post-test consultation, the following issues are determined:
 The level of weights you should begin using
 How many days a week you should train
 How long you should train each workout day
 Which muscle groups require the most work
Getting the green light from 
your primary physician
Checking with a doctor before starting an exercise routine or weight-loss pro-
gram is much more than just a legal disclaimer, so don’t let this advice go in
one ear and out the other. Some conditions and symptoms may require med-
ical attention prior to jumping into exercise, just to make sure that your new
exercise plan is right for you. This is a safety precaution; always err on the
side of caution and see your doctor if you have any concerns. In this section,
we take a look at some important questions that help you decide whether
your first step should be on a treadmill or into a doctor’s office.
If you’re starting an exercise routine that consists of walking or light weights
and you have no medical conditions or complaints, you probably don’t need
medical clearance. If you’re not sure whether you need to see a doctor before

should consult a medical doctor first:
 Are you over the age of 40?
 Are you overweight?
 Do you smoke?
 Have you been sedentary for a long time?
 Are you starting an exercise program that involves more than walking 
or light weights?
 Has a doctor told you that you have a heart murmur?
 Has anyone in your family died of heart disease prior to the age of 55?
 Do you have a high risk of coronary heart disease or stroke?
 Do you have any medical conditions, such as high cholesterol, diabetes,
high blood pressure, or kidney disease?
 Do your ankles swell?
 Have you experienced severe pain in your leg muscles while walking?
 Do you get short of breath more than usual when you’re performing 
routine tasks?
 Have you fainted or do you have dizziness?
 Have you experienced any abnormal heartbeats or chest pain either at
rest or when exerting yourself?
You may have noticed that the first question in the list asks about your age. If
you’re over 40, you may be thinking, “Hey, I’m in the best shape of my life! Why
are they singling me out?” Being over 40 doesn’t mean that you’re old. You’re
on this list because some experts believe that people over 40, whether they’re
at risk for heart disease or other medical conditions, should have a complete
physical examination before starting or intensifying an exercise program.
Relax; there aren’t many situations where your doctor tells you that you can’t
exercise in some fashion. People with heart disease used to be discouraged
from exercising, but studies show that, in many cases, exercise under medical
supervision is helpful for patients with stable heart disease. In one study,
patients with heart disease who were as old as 91 increased oxygen consump-
tion significantly after 6 months of supervised treadmill and stationary bicycle
exercises. Remember, though, that it’s often difficult for a doctor to predict
health problems that may arise as the result of an exercise program, so if you
are at risk for any health problems, be aware of any related symptoms while
you exercise.
After getting the green light to exercise, it’s time to put your plan into action
(before you change your mind).

Crunching your body composition numbers
The BMI determines body mass — not fat percentage. For the percentages,
you need a body composition analysis, which splits your body weight into
individual components: most commonly, lean mass and fat mass.
When people ask you what your lean body mass (lean muscle mass) is, you
likely think that it is an indication of strength and muscle. Lean body mass is
actually the weight of your tissues other than fat; muscles, bones, organs and
fluids of your body, of which 50 to 60 percent is water. Body fat mass is the
percent of the body that is fat and is an important number that sets the mark
for the rest of the body analysis. To figure your body composition, you mea-
sure the percent of fat mass, and then subtract that number from 100 to get
the percentage of lean mass.
The ideal fat percentages for men and women differ. Men have a normal range
of 8 to 25 percent body fat while women should be in the range of 18 to 32
percent body fat. All the testing measures in the following sections are inex-
pensive options to discover more about your body makeup.
Measuring waist circumference; Or, accounting 
for the most dangerous form of fat
Just to make it more confusing, all fat isn’t created equal — one type of fat
has more potential health concerns than the other. People with central obe-
sity (think beer bellies), or fat that is predominantly found in the abdomen
(visceral fat, which is fat packed around the organs in the abdomen) tend to
have more health-related illnesses than those with mostly subcutaneous fat,
which is the type of fat just under the skin and is largely located in the thighs
and buttocks. (See Figure 9-1 for an illustration.)
The difference in danger between the two locales of fat lies in two causes:
 Visceral fat, also known as “organ fat,” is nearer to the body’s most vital
organs than subcutaneous fat, so this fat is the kind that leads to the
bulging belly better known as a beer belly.
 Visceral fat contains properties that increase the risk of insulin resis-
tance, which can contribute to diabetes.
The ideal waist measurement for women is less than 35 inches. For men, an
ideal waist is less than 40 inches. Go over 35 inches for women or 40 for men,
and you increase your risks for health problems — regardless of height. If
your BMI is in the normal range but your waist measurement isn’t, go with
your gut, literally — your waistline overrules your BMI on this one.
193
Chapter 9: Maintaining a Healthy Weight and Fitness Level

Liposuction is often sought after a cosmetic procedure, but the fat it removes
is just that — cosmetic. A study done by the New England Journal of
Medicine found that because liposuction removes only subcutaneous fat, it
doesn’t have much effect on weight-related health risks.
Assessing overall fat and muscle percentages
A body composition analysis uses specific tools that calculate the percentage
of body fat and muscle mass to determine a person’s ideal weight. By far the
most common tool is the simple skinfold caliper, a quick, cheap, and noninva-
sive device that most trained health or fitness professionals can use. It usu-
ally requires taking three measurements at different sites of the body (triceps,
abdomen, and upper thigh) by pinching and measuring subcutaneous body
fat at several points and then plugging these numbers into a formula that cal-
culates body fat. Because the tool is manual, it may have a 3 to 5 percent
error in measurement — the measurement can be affected by the skill level 
of the professional using the tool, and the measurement isn’t accurate for
obese patients. (See Figure 9-2 for an illustration of how the 
skinfold caliper is used.)

Other less-common methods for measuring body composition include the 
following:
 Bioelectrical impedance: This is a fairly inexpensive scale or handheld
device that sends an electrical impulse through your body (don’t worry;
you can’t feel it). It measures body fat by recording how easily the impulse
is transmitted, because an electrical impulse travels through tissues with
more water content (muscle) more easily than those with lower (fat). It
gives a good sense of your body fat changes over time but it may not be
highly accurate. Readings can be easily affected by hydration status (the
amount of fluids consumed, especially water), and muscle mass.
Muscular athletes typically get higher-than-actual results.
 Underwater (hydrostatic) weighing: This technique requires specialized
equipment that includes a water tank with a mounted scale and chair and
highly trained technicians to perform the test. While you’re completely
submerged in a tank of water, you breathe out all air from your lungs to
decrease tendency to float. The test measures body density, which is
compared to your weight on land. When performed correctly, this assess-
ment has less than a 3-percent error rate.

Chapter 9: Maintaining a Healthy Weight and Fitness Level

 Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA): This device is quick, easy, and very
accurate, but it requires expensive equipment typically found only in
hospitals and research centers. The DEXA is an X-ray of the body that
shows fat, muscle, and bone mass based on differing densities.
 Bod Pod: This fairly new device seems to have great promise. You sit in
an enclosed egg-shaped pod for about 5 minutes while computers gener-
ate data from the sensors that determine the amount of air displaced by
your body. These devices are available in most cities and are often used
at local health fairs. Studies show that it’s comparable to underwater
weighing and DEXA, but it’s likely more accurate. The major advantages
are that the equipment is fairly inexpensive, it requires little training to
operate, it’s comfortable for people of all shapes and sizes, and it’s quick
and easy.
Custom-Designing Your Plan 
with Balance in Mind
With so many opportunities to supersize, and so many unhealthy food choices
prominently displayed in grocery stores, making healthy food choices and
sticking to them in the long run are harder than ever. It can be easy to yo-yo
between starving yourself and stuffing yourself, instead of settling comfort-
ably in the middle (which is where you really need to be). After all, whether
you spend your life worrying about your weight or neglecting it entirely, you’re
not living healthfully.
The simple math is this: The cause of weight gain is eating more calories than
you burn. Your body gains one pound for every 3,500 calories it doesn’t use.
People who exercise daily throughout their lives maintain their ideal body
weight more easily than those who don’t. We can’t stress this fact enough.
Counting calories for weight loss
Eating right is the best thing you can do for weight loss. Exercise is always
important, but what you eat and how much is much more important for main-
taining a healthy weight. If you exercise heavily for one hour every day of the
week, but don’t change your diet, you may not lose any weight. We all know
the coworker, neighbor, or fellow gym attendee who exercises religiously for
months, but just doesn’t seem to lose any weight. Most of the time, the
reason is lack of dietary modifications.
You can find a lot of dieting options out there, and most of them center on
getting a good balance of protein and carbohydrates. Drop your calories
down to between 1,200 and 1,800 calories based on exercise intensity and
196
Part IV: Getting Physical 

body size. The goal is to decrease your calorie intake by 500 calories below
the minimum calories that you utilize in a day and then you lose 1 pound per
week. This reduction in calories results in weight loss in most cases and 1 to
2 pounds per week is a healthy weight loss rate. (See Chapter 7 to calculate
your individual caloric needs and see how much protein, carbs, and fat you
should be taking in — and how much you shouldn’t.)
Creating a safe and effective 
exercise program
The popular saying “What your mind can conceive, your body can achieve” 
is a great motto to live by. Use this book to set a solid plan and follow it.
Everyone can live healthier and can improve in some areas.
After a doctor clears you to exercise, and you have some physical assessments
done, you should be able to compile a personalized exercise program to follow.
If you don’t have the help of a personal trainer, set up a program based on your
level of experience. This section guides the way, and Chapters 10 and 11 dig in
a bit deeper.
Covering the bases: The components of a complete routine
A common misconception for people who are just starting a routine is to
focus only on cardio. But in that case, your body burns the energy stored in
your muscles first and burns fat only as a last resort. (We know — it’s a frus-
trating arrangement!) So, a body transformation occurs most efficiently by
simultaneously gaining muscle through strength training and losing fat
through aerobics and diet. (See Chapter 12 for the lowdown on strength train-
ing and Chapter 13 for info on aerobics.) It’s like a tricycle — all three wheels
have to turn at the same time.
Keep these facts in mind as you build your personalized program:
 Aerobic training: Activities like walking, swimming, and biking are all
good for the lungs and heart. See Chapter 11 for more information.
 Strength training: This is the only activity that slows muscle and bone
loss while it promotes weight loss. See Chapter 10 for more information.
Your body needs energy to sustain muscle mass because muscle cells
are metabolically demanding (high-maintenance); for every pound of
muscle you add, your body burns 30 to 50 more calories a day even at
rest. How’s that for a great bargain! (And those burned calories are more
likely to come from fat reserves, which is really the whole point if your
goal is to lose body fat.)
197
Chapter 9: Maintaining a Healthy Weight and Fitness Level

If you’re just beginning your strength training routine or are a novice, we
recommend strength training 20 to 30 minutes two to three days a week.
If you’re an old pro, you’re most likely strength training 30 to 60 minutes
four to five days a week, so keep it up! Don’t forget to incorporate five to
ten minutes of flexibility training to stretch your muscle groups before
and after your strength training.
People over 60 who want to reduce their risk of falls and injury should
start by strengthening legs, arms, and core muscles with two to three
days of weight training a week for three to four weeks before walking
long distances or engaging in aerobic exercise.
 Flexibility training: To maintain good muscle health and reduce injury,
we urge you to incorporate flexibility training through stretching, yoga,
and Pilates. These activities not only feel good but also increase the
range of motion of your joints — see Chapter 10.
Aerobic exercise with weight training using lighter weights and more repeti-
tions is better than weight training alone using heavy, bulking-type weights
and exercises.
In order for your routine to work and be effective, it has to be something you
want to do and take full responsibility for. So, while you decide what kind of
workout you want (weight training and aerobics), where you’re going to get it
(at the gym or on the bike trail), and which days of the week to devote to
which activity (Monday: gym, Wednesday: rollerblade in the park, Thursday:
swimming), personalize and work with your routine until it’s comfortable.
One trick to help you stay on track is to put your weekly plan on paper (or 
in your PDA) on a Sunday night before you start your week. That way, you’re
more likely to stick to it!
Then, of course, you start working out. Many people are wonderful at putting
plans together — and terrible at implementing them! The best exercise plan
in the world won’t do a thing for you unless you actually do it.
People who have been sedentary for long periods (at least 6 to 12 months)
may be at a higher risk for injury because muscle tone is weak, flexibility is
limited, and balance is shaky. Note: Although most people consider walking
the first step in becoming active, starting with strength training may be safer
and more beneficial for people with limitations in their mobility (joint dis-
ease) or aerobic capacities (advanced lung disease).
If you haven’t had much experience in the gym, start with some basic train-
ing. Many fitness centers offer circuit training, which consists of multiple
machines with instructions and displays of the muscle groups that they
target. You cycle through the machines, targeting all the muscle groups. You
can increase the intensity as you go and concentrate on specific weak areas
as you see fit. Aerobic activity can be worked into the schedule or you can
alternate days between aerobic and strength training.

Part IV: Getting Physical 

Factoring in your personality and lifestyle
When starting an exercise routine, you need to first evaluate your personality
and lifestyle. If you create a routine that you don’t enjoy, can’t afford, or can’t
squeeze in, chances are good that you won’t stick with it. Ask yourself the fol-
lowing questions:
 What motivates me? Motivation (or the lack of it) has the power to start
and stop a routine as fast as you can spit the word out. We’ve met a lot
of people who just won’t do aerobic activities like running or biking, but
they can play basketball or soccer for hours. Sports are a great source of
exercise, and joining a league locks you into a schedule. Paying for a
membership gets some people to commit to the gym because they want
to get their money’s worth. Make a bet or a deal with a colleague, friend,
or partner that involves exercise or weight-loss goals. You can get moti-
vated, but sometimes you have to be creative.
 Can I stick to my guns all on my own, or do I need the support of a
group class, support group, planned weight-loss program, workout
partner, or personal trainer? Some people wake up one morning, make
a decision to stop living life in an overweight or simply sedentary body,
and change their habits instantly. Others have a bit more trouble following
through. Maybe they need to socialize and engage with others who have
the same goals to continue toward successfully achieving those goals.
 What type of programs meet my health needs and interest me?
Carefully consider what keeps you coming back for more. For some
people, various classes at the gym are helpful; for others, the commit-
ment to an upcoming 5K or a mini-triathlon piques their interest. Some
people train for the next Iron Man competition, and others with limiting
health conditions may set a goal to maintain their current health.
 What resources are available to me, and how much money am I willing
to spend? You can find an exercise program for any budget. Remember
that allocating funds for your health is an investment that can reduce
medical visits, medications, and time off work. It could be the best
money you spend!
 What time of day is best for me to work out? There’s really no perfect
time of day that maximizes your workouts. Some researchers have tried
to designate a particular workout time based on hormones and body
rhythms, but no solid data is available. Some environmental restrictions,
such as heat, cold, or rain, may make certain times of the day safer (and
make you less likely to cancel). The best time of the day is the time that’s
consistently available to you with the least interruptions. Many people
say that they don’t have the time to exercise. Our response? Ridiculous!
If you can find the time for lunch, your morning coffee, a glass of wine
before bed, or television, you can certainly find time to work out. You
may have to set that alarm clock back an hour or work out during lunch
199
Chapter 9: Maintaining a Healthy Weight and Fitness Level

a few days out of the week, while fitting in a quick meal before or after.
You can even involve your family or partner to make sure that you get
your exercise in.
When searching for time to work out, you’re really talking about priori-
ties. Everybody, we mean everybody, can find two and a half to three
hours per week to exercise.
People who work away from the home statistically cancel workouts more often
if they go home before heading to the gym. After you hit the couch, forget
about it. You need to plan your exercising before you go home — if you don’t,
plan on every excuse in the book entering your mind after you walk through
your front door.
Getting the goods
You don’t need to purchase expensive gym equipment to get a good workout.
Sporting goods stores as well as major discount department stores have all
sorts of products for at-home users or people who want companion pieces
for their exercise classes. Many manufacturers feature products that run the
gamut — from inexpensive starter kits to complete home gym systems with
all the bells and whistles. Of course, you do the workout, but what could be
easier? Here’s a list of some basic equipment to get you started:
 Handheld weights: Hand weights (also known as dumbbells) are a must-
have for any do-it-yourselfer. The most popular variety is vinyl-coated
for comfort and easy grip and color-coded by weight. They range in
increments from 1 to 10 pounds, and then go up to 12 and 15 pounds.
If you’re adding hand weights to your daily walk, go light because there’s
a risk of joint inflammation and injury, especially if you use heavier
weights and don’t do adequate warm-up. If you’re doing bicep curls, 
try a few reps in the store. When your muscles fatigue at 15 repetitions,
you’ve found a good starting weight.
 Resistance bands: These bands are easy to use at any age or fitness level
and offer your muscles a fullrange-of-motion workout. Resistance bands
are long tubes that look like rubber jump ropes with handles. (Shorter
versions come without handles, but we recommend the longer ones —
the most popular and versatile variety — because you can always shorten
them up for working out your arms.) Resistance bands are color-coded
to indicate their strength (thickness).
 Exercise stability balls: Who would’ve thought that sitting on a big, round
ball would be a workout? Seems like mere child’s play until you try to
balance yourself and realize that your body is using micro muscles you
forgot you had! These balls offer numerous exercises and activities that
activate and strengthen those hard-to-reach core muscles often over-
looked during normal training. The balls come in a variety of sizes
according to your height. The most common are 55 cm (for people who
are 5'1" to 5'7") and 65 cm (for people who are 5'8" to 6'1"), although
we’ve seen them as small as 30 cm and as large as 85 cm.
200
Part IV: Getting Physical 

 Floor mat: A closed-cell (nonabsorbent to wick away moisture) foam mat
that’s at least 5⁄8 of an inch thick is great to avoid slipping, and to provide
comfort and support.

Chapter 9: Maintaining a Healthy Weight and Fitness Level
Finding a weight-loss program that works 
your body, not just your wallet
If losing weight is a losing battle for you, finding
the best weight-loss program for you may be a
bit like finding the proverbial needle in a
haystack. People try programs and they lose
weight, only to gain it back again — and then
some. Statistics consistently show that 90 per-
cent of dieters fail, mostly after spending large
sums of money for programs and supplements.
Maintaining is the key in the weight loss world,
but maintenance in most programs is whispered
about or promised with little success. Do your
research to reduce the chance of becoming
one the failed-dieter statistics.
Before signing up for any weight-loss program,
identify the factors that are most important to
ensuring your success by considering the fol-
lowing questions:
 What does the menu plan look like? Are
substitutions allowed? How many calories
a day will you be eating? (Don’t starve your-
self; it isn’t healthy. You should always be
eating at least 1000 calories a day.)
 Does the program promote drinking 80 to
100 ounces of water a day? (If not, move on
to another program.)
 Does the program encourage exercising a
minimum of one hour a day, three days each
week at some point?
 Does the program recommend checking
with your doctor before starting any weight-
loss or exercise program or is it medically
supervised?
 Does the program provide education on
food and nutrition?
 Will you take prescription appetite sup-
pressants? Are they addicting? How long do
you have to take them? Is there strict doctor
supervision? Often use of appetite suppres-
sants will lead to regaining the weight you
lost after the medicine is stopped.
 How much does the program cost? What
does the cost include? Can you find client
testimonials? Can you speak with any of
those clients?
If you have a hard time staying motivated 
and dedicated to a plan, ask about the 
support throughout the program. Choose one
that addresses your needs based on these
questions:
 Will you have a personal weight-loss coun-
selor or coach to help you reach your goals
and answer your questions? If so, what is
that person’s availability (weekly appoint-
ments, phone, e-mail, and so on)?
 Does the program include group support?
 Does the program offer a maintenance
plan? If so, what’s the format and length?
What are the statistics on success rates?
Look into some of these healthy weight-loss
programs:
 Jenny Craig (www.jennycraig.com)
 Nutrisystem (www.nutrisystem.com)
 The Trim Diet (www.trimlifestyle.
com)
 Weight Watchers (www.weightwatch
ers.com)

 Workout DVD: You can find an endless variety of workouts for every
age, lifestyle, and fitness level. Try one from your local movie rental
store or your public library before you buy it.
 Good quality shoes: A comfortable and supportive pair of sneakers is
essential. You don’t have to spend a fortune on the latest in technology
trainers either. Make sure that your shoes have rubber soles and good
arch support. More than anything, they should be comfortable. You may
want to break them in before you wear them for your workout to avoid
blisters. Good shoes are also important if you want to avoid knee pain.
Many shoe manufacturers make cross trainers and other shoes for par-
ticular types of exercise. They need to be comfortably snug and have
proper arch support and cushion to absorb the shocks of training. The
wrong shoes can mean blisters, knee and back pain, and inflammation in
the feet.
From trial to style: Making 
a (good) habit of it
Whatever the reason for starting an exercise routine, you need to have even
better ones for keeping the fire burning. Too often, the smallest hurdle (a
broken fingernail, a mild headache, or a friend saying, “Aw, do you have to
work out today?”) can put out that fire.
Unfortunately, the people newest to the exercise scene seem to get side-
tracked the most easily and have the hardest time getting back. Why? Most
likely because exercise hasn’t become an established way of life, like brush-
ing their teeth and tying their shoes. The longer a newbie delays returning 
to the schedule, the more he drags his feet going back to it.
So, having the right expectation from the get-go is critical. In general, you
need to follow a routine for 21 days in order for it to become habit. And to
achieve a healthy body weight and maintain it, you must truly believe that
there are no short-cuts!
To help avoid this pitfall, keep these suggestions in mind:
 Make exercise a priority. Just like sleeping, eating, working, and spend-
ing time with your family — set a time in your schedule for exercise and
stick to it.
 Practice saying “no.” You can do this in a kind but firm way. When
friends and family try to interfere with your workout plans, say no.
202
Part IV: Getting Physical 

Keep in mind, though, that your routine also affects the people closest
to you; it takes them time to adjust as well. If you’re consistent, you can
ease resentment on both ends.
 Implement a system of checks and balances. Every decision you make
requires some sacrifice to keep things in balance. (No one can have it all,
do it all, or eat it all and reach their goals!) Balance is the key to life, and
weight loss is no different. Trying to lose weight requires sacrifices
every day — but those sacrifices are balanced by the rewards. You have
to get yourself ready by recognizing the difficult situations that make it
hard to make those sacrifices. For instance, don’t have candy in the
house if you love candy. Out of sight, (hopefully!) out of mind.
Sacrifice is important, but torture is unnecessary. Make sure that you
have checks in place to increase your chances of success. If you like
coffee in the morning, have the coffee, but also drink more water. If you
like to have a beer in the evening, switch to a light beer. If you want to
have desert on occasion, work out 3 days a week to balance out those
calories. To succeed in the fitness world, finding balance is essential.
When you establish balance, it becomes habit and a new lifestyle.
Evaluating the success of your efforts
(and rewarding yourself along the way)
Sometimes, despite their best efforts, people encounter the slump of discour-
agement and frustration, especially when they’ve tried to lose weight more
than once, only to gain it back. To bounce back from those self-defeating
thoughts and feelings, refocus with the following methods:
 Focus on the process instead of the end result.
 Focus on what went well today (or this week) and the successes.
 Use visualization and imagery techniques to focus on yourself at your
goal weight, participating in an enjoyable activity.
 Focus on physical activity as an opportunity to do something enjoyable.
 Put away the scale for awhile and focus on making lasting lifestyle
changes. As a result, the weight will come off.
Finding the rewards at the end of your rainbow of sacrifices is easy. Every
time you reach one of your goals, reward yourself. Every positive action
deserves a pat on the back. Get some new clothes or take a mini-trip. And
make sure that you set reasonable goals, because the rewards are that much
more valuable.

Chapter 9: Maintaining a Healthy Weight and Fitness Level

When Weight Just Won’t Come Off:
Considering Weight-Loss Surgery
If you can’t lose weight despite your consistent dietary changes and physical
activity, don’t panic. Some people — although few — really do have medical
reasons for weight gain and an inability to lose weight. Hormone imbalances,
medications, and some genetic mutations can make weight loss difficult for
some, and figuring out how to treat weight gain in these situations has
become a major focus for many medical centers. If you’ve worked hard at
weight loss and haven’t seen significant results (meaning that you haven’t
moved out of the obese category after consistently following our advice in
this book for six months and working with a physician to monitor your diet
and exercise), you may want to consult a doctor who specializes in weight
control.
If you’re having a difficult time with your weight and have some other under-
lying medical conditions that raise the importance of weight loss, your doctor
may decide that surgical treatment is the best option in your situation. But
surgery should be the last resort for at least two reasons:
 Although it guarantees success (at least in the short-term), no surgery is
without risk.
 Surgery isn’t a miracle cure or quick fix for being overweight or, in most
cases, even obese. Sure, it helps — but if a person resumes his bad habits
after adjusting to life post-surgery, he can actually undo the benefits of
the surgery by stretching out a stomach that’s been made smaller.
 The financial costs are high. Sometimes insurance companies cover
weight-loss surgeries, but with surgeries averaging $10,000 to $30,000,
each person’s provider must evaluate whether the benefits outweigh 
the medical risk and financial burden.
The National Institutes of Health recommends that people with a BMI 
of 40 or greater (about 100 pounds overweight) and people with a 
BMI of 35 plus two or more significant obesity-related problems (like 
diabetes or high blood pressure) are appropriate candidates for weight-
loss surgery.
We strongly advise that people considering weight-loss surgery (and we con-
sider it only for the obese) exhaust all options first. A dedicated lifestyle of
nutritious eating on a reduced-calorie diet with vigorous exercise should
always be the first course of action.
204
Part IV: Getting Physical 

If your doctor and you do decide to go the surgery route, your options
include the following:
 Stomach stapling: This operation works on the premise that a smaller
stomach pouch helps people lose weight because they feel fuller with
less food. The size prevents people from overeating, and if they do eat
too much, they feel ill.
 Lap-band: Like stomach stapling, lap-band surgeries are less drastic and,
therefore, more popular than bypass operations. A small adjustable band
is placed around the upper part of the stomach, creating a smaller pouch,
which limits the amount of food that you can eat at one time. However,
patients can cheat more easily than they can with gastric bypass and
stomach stapling because the anatomy of the stomach isn’t as strictly
reduced. As a result, weight reduction tends to be more limited.
 Gastric bypass: This method involves taking the stomach and creating a
small pouch that restricts the amount of food that can be ingested, and
then attaching the small intestine directly to the pouch. About 10 to 20
percent of patients undergoing gastric bypass require follow-up opera-
tions to correct complications; the most common complaints are
abdominal hernias. More than one-third of patients who have gastric
bypass surgery develop gallstones.
Succeeding at the Hardest Part:
Maintaining Your Healthy Weight!
Healthy eating is the biggest component of weight loss. Exercise definitely
helps, and is most important for burning off extra calories from those situa-
tions when you stray from your normal dietary habits such as vacations, par-
ties, or just dessert after a good meal out. Weight maintenance, on the other
hand, is the result of successfully incorporating good nutrition and routine
daily exercise into your lifestyle. Many people can lose weight, but they gain
the weight back quickly. Becoming a yo-yo dieter, one who loses weight and
gains it back, just to try to lose it again in what turns into a vicious cycle,
isn’t healthy and can become expensive if you have to buy new clothes or
expensive diets and diet supplements. 
Weight maintenance comes down to a few things:
 Making consistently smart food choices
 Staying committed to an exercise routine that’s enjoyable and rewarding
 Maintaining plenty of balance and patience
205
Chapter 9: Maintaining a Healthy Weight and Fitness Level

 Weighing yourself weekly; what you don’t know can hurt you
 Refusing to let “just a few little pounds” creep back up on you without
taking immediate action
 Setting goals that work for you, not for someone else
Living life somewhere in the middle is apt to lead to more positive and long-
lasting results than living in the extremes. And people who are able to suc-
cessfully keep their weight down are the ones who have figured out how to
make balanced choices. This isn’t to say that you’ll never eat another double
fudge chocolate sundae — only that you’ve figure out how to make it part of
your balanced choices.

t’s hard to imagine that something the size of your palm is responsible for
sustaining your life. The heart muscle is your body’s engine, and of course,
like any engine, it requires regular maintenance. The best maintenance plan
for a healthy heart includes maximizing the good habits (like training and
strengthening your heart muscle through aerobic exercise and eating heart-
healthy foods) and minimizing the risk factors (like being overweight and
sedentary).
Aerobic (which means “with oxygen”) exercise is any activity that increases
your oxygen intake, causing you to breathe faster or harder and your heart 
to beat faster. Aerobic activity includes many types of exercise that are of
moderate to long duration and low intensity.
In contrast, anaerobic (which means “without air”) exercise includes strength
training and weight training; anaerobic activity doesn’t increase oxygen output
and is of short duration and high intensity. See Chapter 11 for more on anaer-
obic exercise.
In this chapter we show you how regular aerobic exercise can make and keep
your heart healthy; why it’s so important, especially as you get older; and
just how much and what kind you need in order to reap the benefits.
Understanding the Anatomy of the Heart
For all its complexity, your heart is basically a pump made out of muscle, forc-
ing blood to the lungs to be oxygenated and then pumping the oxygenated
blood out to the rest of your body. Any problem that results in a weak pump

affects blood flow throughout your body, and, as you age, different parts of
your pump can start to break down or get clogged up.
Understanding the causes of a weak or damaged pump can help you keep
your heart strong at any age. Understanding any problem areas your heart
has is important if you want to try to prevent serious problems from occur-
ring. Defects within its different chambers and blood vessels result in differ-
ent types of disease, so it’s helpful to understand exactly what’s what when it
comes to your heart’s anatomy.
Your heart’s main function is to continuously pump oxygen- and nutrient-rich
blood throughout your body 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, sending blood to
your lungs to be oxygenated and then out to the rest of the body. This fist-
sized powerhouse expands and contracts to create that familiar beat 100,000
times per day, pumping 5 to 6 quarts each minute — about 2,000 gallons per
day. That’s a lot of love.
On the inside, your heart is a four-chambered, hollow organ that’s divided
into the left and right side by the septum, a muscular wall. (See Figure 10-1 for
an illustration.) The upper two chambers (the left and right atria) receive
blood from the veins; the lower two chambers (the left and right ventricles)
pump blood into the lungs and the rest of the body. A weakness or blockage
in any area can cause heart problems.
As the muscular walls contract (squeeze), they pump blood through your 
vessels:
 The right side of your heart pumps blood to your lungs to fill up on fresh
oxygen and empty the body’s waste product, carbon dioxide.
 The left side of your heart pumps oxygen-rich blood throughout a super
highway of arteries in your body.
Here’s a list of the major blood vessels that enter the heart:
 The aorta, the largest artery in the body, comes out of the left ventricle
and delivers oxygenated blood to the body.
 The superior vena cava, a large vein, enters the right atrium, delivering
oxygen-depleted blood from the head, chest, and upper extremities.
 The inferior vena cava, a large vein, enters the right atrium, delivering
oxygen-depleted blood from the lower extremities.
 The pulmonary artery exits the right ventricle and takes oxygen-poor
blood from the heart to the lungs where it’s oxygenated.
 The pulmonary vein enters the left atrium to bring oxygen-rich blood
from the lungs to the heart.
 The coronary arteries originate at the aorta and supply blood to the
heart muscle.

The Importance of Aerobic Activity 
and a Heart-Healthy Diet
Inactivity is one of the four major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD);
also known as atherosclerotic heart disease). In fact, people who are inactive
have a 30 to 50 percent higher risk of developing CVD than those who are mod-
erately active. The role inactivity plays in developing CVD is complex, because
the risk varies depending on what other risk factors a person has. However,
because inactivity contributes to several risk factors of CVD, such as obesity,
high blood pressure, and diabetes, it appears that increasing your physical
activity can decrease your risk of CVD in several ways.
How inactivity damages your health
Being a “couch potato” may be one of the riskiest behaviors around, and 
one of the most commonly practiced. According to the Federal Drug
Administration (FDA), one in four adults is sedentary, meaning that they 
sit around too much.

Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Heart

The heart, being a muscle, needs exercise to keep it strong and to keep the
blood vessels that deliver blood to the heart working well. Some people have
jobs that require constant walking or intense physical labor; others must find
ways to be active when they get home, such as going to the gym, mowing the
lawn, doing home improvement projects, or just taking a walk. The real prob-
lem begins when people who don’t have active jobs also don’t get any exercise
at home. This fully sedentary approach to life is often combined with poor
nutrition; the impact that both poor nutrition and inactivity can have on the
heart can lead to serious heart disease.
How aerobic exercise improves your health
Want to increase your life span and your health without spending thousands
of dollars? Want to try something that takes up just an hour of your time each
day, a few days a week? A half an hour to an hour of aerobic exercise — which
can be any type exercise that increases your heart rate for a sustained amount
of time — three to four times a week can do the trick for you.
How can such a small amount of time a day yield such great results? The jour-
nal Diabetes Care reported that whether people lost weight, the ones who
worked out 38 minutes a day lowered their blood pressure, heart disease
risk, cholesterol, and AIC levels. The increase in activity equaled only about
2,200 extra steps a day.
Like all muscles, the heart becomes stronger and larger as a result of exer-
cise; it can then pump more blood through the body with every beat and 
sustain its maximum level with less strain. The resting heart rate of people
who exercise is also slower because less effort is needed to pump blood.
Regular aerobic exercise significantly benefits you in the following ways:
 Aids in regulating blood pressure: Regular exercise (at least 30 minutes
of exercise on most, if not all, days) helps keep arteries elastic, even in
older people, which ensures blood flow and normal blood pressure.
Sedentary people have a 35 percent greater risk of developing high blood
pressure (hypertension) than athletes do, but you don’t need high-inten-
sity exercise to lower blood pressure. In fact, in one study, moderate exer-
cise (jogging 2 miles a day) controlled hypertension so well that more
than half the patients who had been on high blood pressure meds were
able to discontinue them. So, even if you’re not a competitive athlete, you
can still get excellent benefits from less intense levels of exercise.
Studies also indicate that yoga and T’ai Chi, an ancient Chinese exercise
involving slow, relaxing movements, may lower blood pressure almost as
well as moderate-intensity aerobic exercises. (Check out T’ai Chi For
Dummies by Therese Iknoian and Yoga For Dummies by Georg
Feuerstein, Larry Payne, and Lilias Folan [Wiley]).

High blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke, so regulating your
blood pressure is a good way to minimize your risk of stroke. The effects
of exercise on stroke aren’t well established, but most studies are posi-
tive. The following are some examples:
• According to one major analysis, men cut their risk for stroke in
half when their exercise program roughly equated one hour of
brisk walking five days a week. In the same study, exercise that
involved recreation was more protective against stroke than exer-
cise routines consisting simply of walking or climbing.
• A 2000 study of women also found substantial protection from
stroke due to brisk walking or striding (not simply casual walking).
If you have high blood pressure, discuss an exercise program with your
doctor before starting. In addition, you should:
• Work with your doctor to lower your pressure enough that you can
control it with medications before you begin an exercise program.
• Avoid caffeinated beverages, which increase heart rate, the work-
load of the heart, and blood pressure during physical activity.
• Breathe as normally as possible through each exercise (holding
the breath increases blood pressure).
 Increases oxygen consumption: Exercise increases the total number of
red blood cells in the body to facilitate transport of oxygen. People who
exercise the most often and vigorously have the lowest risk for heart dis-
ease, but any exercise is beneficial. Studies consistently find that light to
moderate exercise is even beneficial in people with existing heart dis-
ease, as long as your doctor prescribes the activity, and in some cases,
supervises the activity.
Progressive resistance training (like using hand weights) may be particu-
larly useful. Even daily handgrip exercises can improve blood flow.
Only your doctor can prescribe an appropriate exercise program for
your particular cardiovascular situation. Consult you doctor before
starting an exercise program if you have any type of heart disease.
 Strengthens muscles: Aerobic exercises can help tone muscles through-
out the body, which can provide several benefits:
• Improves overall circulation and reduces blood pressure
• Increases storage of energy molecules, such as fats and carbohy-
drates, within the muscles for increased endurance
• Increases the dilation of blood vessels in the muscle fibers, which
improves blood flow through the muscles.
• Strengthens muscles involved in respiration to facilitate the flow of
air in and out of the lungs
211
Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Heart

 Assists weight loss: In 2002, a study on overweight adults confirmed
beneficial changes in cholesterol and lipid levels, including lower LDL
levels (bad cholesterol) even with very modest weight loss, suggesting
that overweight people who have trouble losing pounds can still achieve
considerable heart benefits by exercising.
Even people who performed low amounts of moderate- or high-intensity
exercise, such as walking or jogging 12 miles a week, received benefits.
More intense exercise is required to significantly change cholesterol
levels, notably increasing HDL (good cholesterol). An example of such 
a program is jogging about 20 miles a week.
 Lowers the risk for type 2 diabetes: Exercise lowers blood sugar,
improves insulin sensitivity, and strengthens the heart — important
issues for diabetics and people at risk for diabetes. One study found 
that adults who worked out 21⁄2 hours a week cut their risk of type 2 
diabetes by 58 percent.
How heart-healthy foods help 
keep your clicker clean
Can you eat your way to good cardiac health? There’s no question that a diet
rich in fruits and vegetables is beneficial to heart health and can considerably
reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. The exact reason is still unclear,
but medical researchers theorize that antioxidants in fruit and vegetables
lower LDL cholesterol levels in the blood. Foods with anthocyanin, a flavonoid
(plants known for their antioxidant properties) in the skins of dark-colored
fruits and vegetables, are best. See Chapter 7 for more on these foods.
The very large Harvard Nurse’s Health Study, which followed more than
110,000 people over a 14-year period, found that people who averaged eight
servings of fruit and vegetables a day were 30 percent less likely to suffer a
heart attack or stroke than those who ate one and a half servings or less per
day. According to a study by the United States Centers for Disease Control,
only 27 percent of women and 19 percent of men report eating the recom-
mended five servings of fruits and vegetables each day.
For other heart healthy food choices, consider that the fiber in unrefined (not
processed) whole-grain foods can help lower your blood cholesterol. The
American Heart Association recommends soluble fiber from whole-grain
foods like bran, oatmeal, and whole wheat bread for a heart-healthy diet.
Another great dietary addition is omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish or fish oil
supplements, some nuts (such as English walnuts), and vegetable oils. Studies
support that omega-3 fatty acids lower triglycerides and reduce your risk of
heart attack or stroke (blockage type), especially if you have known cardio-
vascular disease. You need to follow the recommended dosing, because
212
Part IV: Getting Physical 

people who ingest more than 3 grams a day can actually have an increased
risk of hemorrhagic (bleeding type) stroke. Omega-3 fatty acids have also
been associated with slightly lowering blood pressure.
Substituting soy proteins for animal proteins may also help lower LDL choles-
terol, according to the American Heart Association.
Aerobic Exercise — Ready, Set, Go!
Lucky for you, aerobic exercise comes in a wide variety of choices. For exam-
ple, running a long distance at a moderate pace is an aerobic exercise, and
playing singles tennis with near-continuous motion is generally considered
aerobic activity. Other examples are swimming laps, biking, rollerblading, and
cross country skiing. By getting your body moving through aerobic exercise,
you breathe more deeply, making your heart work harder to pump blood.
The type of exercise — or exercises — you decide to concentrate on is up to
you. Some forms of aerobic workouts are certainly more familiar, but finding
an activity you enjoy is the key, as long as it keeps your heart rate elevated
for a continuous time period. Check out your local health club for a schedule
of activities; almost every one of them — from kickboxing to belly dancing to
spin classes to yoga — can provide aerobic benefits.
Engaging in the joint-damaging, high-impact styles of workout isn’t necessary.
The same cardiovascular effects can be obtained through low-impact work-
outs like swimming and working out on an elliptical trainer, and you avoid the
bone and muscle jarring that can result in strains, sprains, and muscles tears.
Although most healthy people of any age can safely engage in moderate levels
of physical activity (such as walking, gardening, and yard work) without con-
sulting a doctor first, some people — particularly those age 40 or over —
should see a doctor for a medical evaluation before beginning a physical activ-
ity program, especially one that involves intense training. (See Chapter 9 for a
checklist to help you decide whether you need to consult a physician before
starting a new exercise routine.)
The time factor: How long and how often?
When people begin an exercise program, many begin exercising too hard and
for too long. Doing too much too fast can result in muscle injury, and then
you’re sidelined for weeks while you heal. The American Heart Association
recommends that you engage in moderate to intense aerobic exercise for 30
to 60 minutes three to four days a week. This recommendation supports simi-
lar exercise guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and the American College of Sports Medicine.
213
Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Heart

Some studies suggest that the greatest heart protection isn’t about the dura-
tion of a single exercise session; it’s about the total daily amount of energy
you use. In other words, the best way to work out may be with multiple short
bouts of intense exercise. This advice can be particularly helpful for older
people because they may not have the stamina for sustained exercise.
Starting off and ending right: 
Warming up and cooling down
Warming up and cooling down are important parts of every exercise routine.
They help your body make the transition from rest to activity and back again,
and can help prevent soreness or injury, especially in older people. Starting a
workout too quickly can lead to muscle strain and injury, and stopping too
suddenly can sharply reduce blood pressure, which is a particular danger for
older people because they may become lightheaded and/or faint. Skipping a
cool-down period may also cause muscle cramping.
Proper rest and recovery are also as important to health as exercise; other-
wise your muscles can’t improve or adapt adequately to the exercise.
When planning your exercise program, don’t forget the following warm-up
and cool-down tips:
 Practice warm-up exercises for 5 to 10 minutes at the beginning of an
exercise session. Older people may need a longer period — typically at
least 10 minutes — to warm up their muscles. A few warm-up options
are to do some jumping jacks, jump rope, or go for a light jog or even
just a short walk. The warm-up could be just a slower form of the activ-
ity that you’re aiming to do. You just want to get the heart rate going and
start warming the muscles.
If you want to stretch as part of your warm-up, be sure to do so carefully
and do it after your initial warm-up — if you stretch cold muscles too
quickly, you can injure them.
 The cool-down is used to gradually decrease the heart rate until it’s 
10 to 15 beats above your resting heart rate. This part of your routine
should take about as long as the warm-up — 5 to 10 minutes. You may
want to include lowering the intensity of the exercise you just performed.
Stretching is a great option for the cool-down period. It helps to relax the
muscles and increase flexibility. You should try to hold the stretches for
about 20 to 30 seconds and cover all the major muscle groups. One theory
is that cool-down stretching could reduce future injury, but it hasn’t
been proven.

The meat of the aerobic workout:
Determining your target zone
Being confronted with fancy equipment for determining whether you’re exer-
cising in the “zone” or for figuring out what your “target heart rate” is may be
enough to push you away from exercise forever — or have you sticking to
something simple, like a walk around the block. Although any exercise is
better than none at all, proper exercise gives you more bang for the buck in
terms of cardiac benefits. Fear not — we’re here to help you understand what
your target rate, maximum rate, and VO2 zone are and how to find them. It’s
easier than it sounds!
Identifying the terminology you need to know
If you’re going to make exercise an important part of your healthy aging rou-
tine, you need to learn the lingo. Knowing how your heart rate and oxygen
capacity can determine the quality of your exercise helps develop an appro-
priate routine. Determining what your heart rate should be based on your
age and exercise intensity not only improves your aerobic workouts, but also
keeps you from overdoing it and possibly harming your heart instead of help-
ing it. Here’s a look at some of the exercise terms that you may hear bandied
about the gym:
 Maximum heart rate. This is the maximum rate that your heart should
beat while exercising. Reaching rates beyond your maximum heart rate
can be unsafe. The easy calculation is
220 – your age = maximum heart rate
Example: If you’re 40 years old, 220 – 40 = 180 beats per minute
 Target heart rate. Target heart rate is measured as the number of beats
per minute that you want to achieve for maximum exercise benefit. The
target heart rate lets you measure your initial fitness level and monitor
your progress in a fitness program. This approach requires measuring
your pulse periodically while you exercise and staying within 60 to 85
percent of your maximum heart rate (your target heart rate zone). In
your specific zone, you attempt to achieve a percentage of this maxi-
mum heart rate.
Target heart rate = 60 to 85 percent × the maximum heart rate
(Beginners start with 60 percent; moderate exercisers 75 percent;
and advanced exercisers 85 percent.)
Example: If you’re 40 years old, your maximum heart rate is 180 beats
per minute. Take this number and multiply by 60 to 85 percent depend-
ing on your level of exercise.
180 (maximum heart rate) × 0.6 (60 percent for beginners) = 108
beats per minute
215
Chapter 10: Strengthening Your Heart

This number may seem low, but it’s for beginners or a starting point for
people who have an underlying medical condition. This number is
increased gradually until you get to 85 percent.
Table 10-1 shows estimated target heart rates for different ages. Look for
the age category closest to yours, and then read across to find your
target heart rate.
A few high blood pressure medications, primarily beta blockers (propra-
nolol, metoprolol, nadolol, and atenolol), lower the maximum heart rate
and thus the target zone rate. If you’re taking such medicine, call your
physician to find out whether you need to use a lower target heart rate.
 Aerobic capacity (VO2 max). This term describes the status of the car-
diorespiratory system (the heart, lungs, and blood vessels) and is the
maximum volume of oxygen that can be consumed by your muscles
during exercise (which is why it’s often called VO2 max). The aerobic
capacity represents your cardiorespiratory performance and your mus-
cles’ ability to extract the oxygen and fuel they receive. The higher your
VO2 max, the more oxygen is transported to exercising muscles and the
longer you can exercise without exhaustion. So, the higher aerobic
capacity, the higher your level of aerobic fitness.
To measure maximum aerobic capacity, you exercise on a treadmill, first
by walking at an easy pace and then, at set time intervals during graded
exercise tests, gradually increasing the workload.

Creating an aerobic routine that meets your goals
Now that you know your target heart rate, you need a plan to reach your goal
safely, without injuring muscles. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is a
healthy heart!
When starting an exercise program, aim at the lowest part of your target zone
(60 percent) during the first few weeks. Gradually build up to the higher part
of your target zone (75 percent). After six months or more of regular exercise,
you may be able to exercise comfortably at up to 85 percent of your maxi-
mum heart rate. Note: You don’t have to exercise that hard to stay in shape.
It’s not necessary to be a marathoner (unless you really want to be) or to
spend hours every day at the gym (unless you really love it there). Studies
show that making exercise a habit and keeping your heart rate in the aerobic
zone for 30 to 45 minutes most days gives you the cardiovascular benefits
you need to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease.
Based on your goals, follow these guidelines:
 If you’re a beginner with a goal of improving overall fitness, losing weight,
or reducing stress, exercise in the healthy heart zone, which is 50 to 60
percent of your maximum heart rate.
 If you already exercise regularly but are aiming to lose body fat, exercise
in the weight management zone, which is 60 to 70 percent of your maxi-
mum heart rate. Build up to a workout of an hour of continuous exercise.
 If your goal is to improve aerobic capacity or athletic performance, exer-
cise in the aerobic zone, which is 70 to 80 percent of your maximum
heart rate.
 Competitive athletes may need to add interval training sessions during
the week in the anaerobic threshold heart rate zone, which is 80 to 90 per-
cent of maximum. This high-intensity exercise helps train muscles to
handle lactic acid.
Exercising regularly at a heart rate intensity that’s too high doesn’t produce
additional aerobic benefits; however, it does increase the possibility of an
athletic injury.
To receive the benefits of physical activity, you don’t want to tire too quickly.
Pacing yourself is especially important if you’ve been inactive.

W
hen you think of exercise, you may think of walking, jogging, or
cycling — but not strength training. Who, you, lift weights? Yes —
although there’s more to strength training than just lifting weights. The bene-
fits of strength training for everyone at any age, not just body builders, have
been studied in detail only over the past few decades. Strength training is
more than just lifting weights to build muscle, although building muscle is
excellent for staying in shape, maintaining your weight, and releasing endor-
phins, which make you feel good.
Strength training also makes your bones more dense, improves your balance
(reducing the risk of falls), and can reduce the pain and disability of arthritis.
In this chapter, we dissect your muscles, show you what happens on the
inside when you do strength training, help you design a workable and effec-
tive strength-training program, and even give you tips on what to do when
you’ve overdone it.
The Importance of Muscle Maintenance
and Strengthening
Staying in shape as you get older is much more than a vanity thing. Keeping
your muscles strong can help keep your whole body healthy, from your heart
to your bones, and can help you live independently as you age. One of the

greatest risks of aging is the increased incidence of falls; people who do
strength training regularly are much less likely to fall and break a hip. Why?
Because the more muscle mass you have, the better you protect your body
against bone loss and joint deterioration — not to mention the fact that
strength training for strong muscles also fosters growth in bone density.
Building muscle also decreases the amount of body fat you have, and body
fat brings risks to your heart and cardiovascular system. So you definitely
want to shed those extra pounds.
What happens to aging muscles
As people age, their skeletal muscle mass starts to deteriorate. Your skeletal
muscles (also known as lean muscle) are the muscles that attach to your
bones and are under voluntary control. These muscles include the biceps
(more on the other two types of muscle later in this chapter).
As a result of deterioration, people begin to look, well, flabby as they get
older. You may see these changes start as early as your 30s, but most people
see the biggest changes between their 40s and 50s. You may find yourself
staring in the mirror, wondering when your body started slipping south.
A recent study concluded that total muscle mass decreases by nearly 50 per-
cent for people between the ages of 20 and 90. On average, people lose about
30 percent of their strength between ages 50 and 70, and another 30 percent
of what’s left per decade after that. Generally, people lose about 1 percent of
their lean muscle mass per year after age 40.
There are four types of muscle weakening (called atrophy) that become more
common as people age, and each type responds differently to strength train-
ing. They include the following:
 Sedentary: Muscle deterioration is a natural process, but a sedentary
lifestyle can accelerate it. You can rebuild muscle mass lost from a
sedentary lifestyle — all you have to do is get off the couch and do
something physical! Some sedentary people include those who are
bedridden, astronauts, and people with minimal physical activity.
Statistics show that people confined to bed can lose around 1 percent of
muscle strength for each day in bed. Physical therapy is often pre-
scribed as treatment for people who are bedridden so that they don’t
have muscle loss. A person’s recovery time from being bedridden can 
be improved if the proper actions are taken to prevent muscle loss.
Interestingly, muscle loss also affects astronauts, who spend much time
in a weightless state!
220
Part IV: Getting Physical 

 Age-related: Age-related muscle loss is also called sarcopenia, which
means “vanishing flesh.” Sarcopenia isn’t an inevitable part of aging; it’s
the result of the loss of around ten ounces of muscle a year that isn’t
replaced due to a sedentary lifestyle. You can win this muscle back with
a strength-training program.
 Medication-related: Certain medications, such as systemic corticos-
teroids (often prescribed for people with asthma or inflammatory 
conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus), can result in muscle
weakness.
 Disease-related: Muscle atrophy from disease can be more difficult to
overcome, especially when it involves nerve damage or disease of the
muscle itself. The muscle loss in these situations is more damaging
because you have almost no use of the diseased muscles. With the other
types of muscle loss, you have at least some use of the muscle groups.
Cancer can also result in a muscle wasting syndrome called cachexia.
Diseases that cause cachexia often progress rapidly; many have no cure
and are progressively disabling. Work closely with your doctor to pre-
vent muscle loss if you have any of these conditions:
• Nerve diseases affecting muscles, including polio (poliomyelitis)
• Lou Gehrig’s disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS)
• Guillain-Barre syndrome (self-limiting demyelinating polyradicu-
loneuropathy), which can cause short-term muscle weakness or
paralysis
Other diseases affecting muscles include muscular dystrophy, conges-
tive heart disease, liver disease, and AIDS. If you have any of these ill-
nesses, talk to your doctor about setting up a physical therapy program
to help you retain as much muscle mass as possible.
In addition to general skeletal muscle loss, the following changes occur as
you age:
 Muscles take longer to respond to brain signals in your 50s than they
did in your 20s. As a normal course of aging, you begin to lose the
muscle fibers that are responsible for making you move quickly. The
speed of transmission of impulses from the brain to the muscles also
slows down, so it takes longer to get the signal, “Hey! Move it!” Your
muscles also can’t repair themselves as quickly as they used to, due to 
a decrease in enzyme activities and protein turnover.
 The water content of tendons (the cord-like tissues that attach muscles
to bones) decreases as you age. This change makes the tissues stiffer
and less able to tolerate stress.
 Your heart muscle becomes less able to propel large quantities of blood
quickly through your body. As a result, you tire more quickly and take
longer to recover. Check out Chapter 13 for info on keeping your heart
muscle healthy and strong.

How exercise can help
Whether you’re physically inactive due to your job and daily responsibilities,
or you’re a classic couch potato, or you’ve been bedridden due to a broken
leg, your muscles start to rebuild as soon as you put them to work with some
strength training.
You can delay or minimize the onset of age-related muscle atrophy if you
incorporate strength training as part of your daily or weekly routine. You may
notice that you have to work out a little harder just to keep from losing your
lean muscle mass, but a nutrient-rich diet, strength training, and hormone
supplements can help you keep and possibly build more muscles. Even 80-
year-old muscles benefit from strength training, so it’s never too late to start.
Muscles that haven’t been exercised can be revitalized at any time, whether
you’re 18 or 80 years old.
The longer your muscles have been inactive, the more slowly you must begin
exercising them. If you haven’t exercised or have any condition that has lim-
ited your activity for more than six months, you should consult your physician
prior to any exercise. Note: The muscle, of course, must be healthy and
already have some mobility.
Calling All Muscles: Report for Duty!
Think you don’t have any muscles? You do — you have 640 of them! Muscles
attached to bone is what allows you to move, and muscles are found through-
out your body, and some of them act without your knowledge — or permis-
sion! Check out the following sections for further info on the different types
of muscles in your body.
The three types of muscle
Muscle movement can be either voluntary and involuntary — voluntary mus-
cles are those that you have control over; involuntary muscles do their own
thing whether you want them to or not (and whether you’re aware of them or
not!). Within these general categories, you have three types of muscle:
 Skeletal muscle: This voluntary muscle is commonly referred to as lean
muscle mass and is attached to bone. Skeletal muscle helps you move
the various parts of your body — biceps, hamstrings, quadriceps, and
basically any muscle you can tone at the gym.
222
Part IV: Getting Physical 

In this chapter, we focus primarily on your skeletal muscles because you
have some control over strengthening them.
 Smooth muscle: This involuntary muscle moves food along your diges-
tive tract and blood through blood vessels. For example, peristalsis is
rhythmic movements of the muscles that force food from the throat into
the esophagus and then into the stomach. It also allows you to eat and
drink while swinging upside-down on the monkey bars!
As for your smooth muscles, they pretty much take care of themselves.
There really aren’t exercises for beefing up your colon.
 Heart muscle: This involuntary muscle keeps your heart pumping with-
out your having to think about it — imagine how stressful life would be if
you had to concentrate on keeping your heart beating all day long!
Your heart is clearly your most important muscle, but strengthening it
doesn’t involve weights; we cover it all on its own in Chapter 10.
The major skeletal muscle groups
In this section, we cover the major skeletal muscle groups, what they do, and
the best ways to strengthen them for maximum muscle health. Here’s a list of
muscle groups and their jobs (see Figures 11-1 and 11-2):
 Chest: Help you breathe, lift a sagging chest, improve posture, and lift
breast tissue
 Abdominals: Help hold in your stomach and support your back
 Back: Keep the spine in position, support your stomach, strengthen
your core, strengthen your posture, and help with low back pain
 Shoulders: Lift, turn, and rotate the arms; keep the chest, back, and neck
in line
 Biceps: Move the arms toward the shoulders and turn the arms. Also the
muscle you flex when someone asks you to “make a muscle.”
 Triceps: Straighten the arm. The lack of triceps toning allows your arm
flab to jiggle when you wave goodbye.
 Quadriceps: Help you walk by allowing you to bend your knee; help pro-
tect against kneecap cartilage loss
 Hamstrings: Allow you to straighten your leg
 Calves: Lift the heel for walking

The Two Types of Muscle-
Related Training
Muscles live to work for you. The more you put into them, the more they’ll
work for you. Unlike any human-built machine (like a car or a computer), the
more you rev up your muscles, the bigger they get and the harder they work
for you. That’s where strength training (sometimes called strength and resis-
tance training; see the nearby sidebar “What’s in a name? Strength versus
resistance training”) along with flexibility for stretching, stamina, and agility
come into play.
To minimize confusion, we use the term strength training throughout this
book to refer to both because, in all actuality, if you’re strength training,
you’re inherently resistance training.
Strength training
Unlike aerobic exercise, which increases your heart rate, strength training
concentrates on using your muscles to exert or resist force. This process can
be done by using free weights, using weight machines — or other equipment
226
Part IV: Getting Physical 
The female monster-muscle 
myth and other hogwash
Women may worry that strength training makes
their muscles bulky. Nothing can be farther from
the truth. Most women don’t have the genetic
makeup or enough of the male hormone, testos-
terone, to bulk up like Popeye. That said, how-
ever, women are perfectly capable of
developing strong, lean muscles. Pound-for-
pound, female muscles are just as strong as a
male’s.
You may also have heard that strength training
can be dangerous for women. More hogwash!
Under a microscope, male and female muscle
tissue are identical. Women are just as resilient
as men and benefit from the same strength-
training routines. Strength training also provides
added protection against osteoporosis,a thinning
of the bones that occurs after menopause (see
Chapter 6).
Another reason some women stay away from
strength training is because they’re addicted to
the scale. Have you ever heard a woman say
that she’s gained, not lost weight, after a couple
of weeks of weight training? The reason behind
the weight gain is that muscle is denser than fat.
So, you may weigh more for a few weeks as
your body adjusts its fat and muscle ratios. Soon
enough, however, you notice that your pants
aren’t as tight around the waist. People start
telling you that you look thinner. Our best
advice? Throw out the scale! Evaluate yourself
by the way your clothes fit and the way you feel.

that offers resistance when you push or pull against it, such as elasticized
bands called resistance bands — or by doing exercises such as pushups. 
You can choose the option that works best for you.
Within each of the options for strength training are several other options, and
it can get confusing trying to decide where to start. The following descrip-
tions may help you:
 Free weights: With nothing more than a pair of dumbbells, free weights
provide you with a variety of options to spice up any workout for many
of your muscle groups. All you need is a little desire, creativity, and good
form. A basic starter set of free weights is also fairly inexpensive and so
small that you can store the weights very easily.
Be sure that your form is correct so you get the maximum benefit and
don’t injure yourself. With some guidance, practice, and a little common
sense, you’ll be building your biceps in no time.
 Weight machines: These are a great choice for strength training, particu-
larly if you belong to a fitness center. Machines are safe, smooth, and easy,
and they specifically target one muscle or group of muscles. They’re often
set up in a specific routine to quickly exercise all the muscle groups.
Some people go this route in an attempt to bypass the personal trainer.
The machines can guide you through the movements to achieve better
form than dumbbells or bar bells.
Machines are great for beginners, because they don’t have much of an
intimidation factor. You select the seat height and the appropriate weight,
and you follow the machine’s range of motion to guarantee that you hit
your target muscle. Because beginners aren’t familiar with proper form,
these machines also help prevent injuries by controlling the movements.
Most gym staff members are more than happy to help you get started.
Also, if you want some great guidance on starting a weight-training pro-
gram, Weight Training For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Liz Neporent,
Suzanne Schlosberg, and Shirley J. Archer (Wiley), is your ticket.

Chapter 11: Building and Fine-Tuning Healthy Muscles
What’s in a name? Strength 
versus resistance training
Chances are you’ve heard of both strength
training and resistance training and are a bit
fuzzy on the difference between the two — and
for good reason! Strength and resistance train-
ing are largely interchangeable terms:
 Strength training is weight training.
 Resistance training is a specific form of
strength training in which you perform each
effort against an opposing force (elastic or
hydraulic resistance).

 Low-impact resistance training: With resistance training, you only pull
or push to get a rewarding workout. The beauty of resistance training is
its low impact on your joints, because it allows you to create a full range
of motion. Resistance training comes in the following forms:
• Swimming, with or without water weights and swimming gloves,
and other water exercises
• Bicycle riding
• Elliptical machines (look like a cross between a stair-stepper,
cross-country ski machine, and bicycle without a seat)
• All-in-one resistance machines (allow you to work a number of dif-
ferent muscle groups without switching machines)
• Stair steppers
• Resistance bands (used for strength training and available in grad-
uated amounts of tension for isolating muscle groups)
• Calf raises and push-ups (easy exercises, good for stretching and
strength training)
 Exercise balls: This equipment works the core muscles, which helps you
improve your balance and coordination by strengthening muscles in
your upper legs, back, and abdominal region.
Water exercises offer another type of low-impact training. Many fitness cen-
ters even offer classes. Water aerobics is for people who want to develop
muscle and increase their strength but don’t want to worry about their bal-
ance or the impact on their joints (or how to use those machines in the gym).
You can buy weights for your arms or legs to help increase resistance as you
exercise in the pool.
Flexibility training
Flexibility is the other half of the equation in strength training. Although you
can have muscle strength and not be flexible, it doesn’t necessarily make for
easier living. What good does it do a 55-year-old woman to bench press 50
pounds if she can’t bend over and tie her shoes? In addition to improving
your balance and range of motion, flexibility training helps prevent and treat
injury.
Exercise routines that include flexibility and range-of-motion movements not
only strengthen muscles but also calm the mind. The goal of these exercises
is to lengthen the fascia, a fibrous tissue that covers all muscle, allowing the
underlying muscle to move and grow. The following programs provide this
essential training:
228
Part IV: Getting Physical 

 Stretching: Think twice before skipping this step, which people often
skip. Stretching is a great way to give your body a gentle wake-up call 
(as opposed to a blaring revelry at 0500) or an effective warm-up. More
than just being nice to your body, the benefits of stretching include
• Preparing your joints for motion to help you avoid injury in the
muscles you work
• Helping reduce muscle soreness and cramping because it
increases your flexibility after a workout
 Yoga: Yoga can make you more fit and improve your flexibility, strength,
and endurance. The most familiar form of yoga works primarily through
various levels of postures (from the Cat to the Corpse) combined with
breathing exercises.
If you want to kick it up a notch, add the most physically challenging
style of hatha yoga in Power Yoga For Dummies by Doug Swenson (Wiley).
You still benefit from flexibility, strength, and endurance, but you turn
up the heat with aerobic intensity for an empowering mind and body
workout.
Don’t be fooled into thinking that yoga is just for women and old people.
Yoga stretches can be challenging even for the fittest individuals. (For
more information on yoga, read Chapter 15.)
 T’ai Chi: For nearly 5,000 years, people have practiced T’ai Chi as a way
to prolong life, build strength and stamina, improve concentration, and
achieve psychological balance. This form of training can also help you
increase balance and flexibility while you tone your muscles. People of
any age can enjoy T’ai Chi.
If you’re 60 years or older, find out whether your community offers T’ai
Chi programs for seniors. Because recent statistics show that T’ai Chi
helps reduce falls, many states are funding these programs, making them
free to the public.
 Pilates: Once thought of as just for professional dancers, this great 
activity combines elements of yoga, dance, gymnastics, and boxing 
with a little modern creativity thrown in. With Pilates, you can tone 
your muscles, improve balance, lengthen your spine, strengthen your
core muscles, and improve flexibility and coordination.

Putting Your Strength- and Flexibility-
Increasing Plan into Action — Safely
If you’re not careful, your workout can leave you in worse shape than before
you started. Your first thought when starting a strength training program
should be “safety first.” Unfortunately, many folks put safety last, at least
until they drop a dumbbell on their foot and are sidelined from strength train-
ing for weeks.
Sprains, strains, pulls, and other injuries can all wreak havoc on an exercise
routine, so start slow, watch your form, and follow the suggestions in the
next sections. If you do injure yourself, we also tell you how to take care of
yourself to get back on your feet as quickly as possible.
Moving through your training 
and individual workouts
Planning your training workout can be complicated if you look at all the con-
flicting information on the Internet. Don’t worry about the differing opinions
too much; the most important thing is to just get started, and you can refine
your routine down the road. Here are some other important tips to keep you
moving forward safely and effectively:
 Alternate between upper and lower body on the days you strength
train. For example, work out your upper body (your arms, chest, and
back) one day, and then your lower body the next time you train. When
you strength train, you actually create tiny tears in your muscles that

Preventing accidental falls among older adults
It’s a frightening reality. More than one-third of
adults 65 and older fall each year. Of those who
fall, 20 to 30 percent suffer moderate to severe
injuries that make getting around or living alone
more difficult and increase the chance of early
death. Older adults are hospitalized five times
more often for fall-related injuries than injuries
from other causes.
The most common fractures are of the spine,
hip, forearm, leg, ankle, pelvis, upper arm, and
hand. Many people who fall, even those who
aren’t injured, develop a fear of falling. This fear
creates a limit of activities, which leads to
reduced mobility and physical fitness, which in
turn increases the risk of falling.
How can older adults prevent falls? Improve
lean muscle mass and exercise! Muscle helps
support the body’s frame, and regular exercise
supports the strong muscles with balance, cir-
culation, strength, and confidence.

need to heal before you lift again. (For this reason, don’t work the same
muscles two days in a row.) This important process is key to your pro-
gram because it allows your muscles to come back just a little bit
stronger each time.
 After six or more weeks of consistent strength training, add more
weight and change the order of your workout to make it more chal-
lenging. For example, if your workout consists of a routine to work dif-
ferent muscle groups, change the order of your workout. You may want
to change the time of day as well.
After you have some of the basics incorporated into your training routine,
you may be interested in improving your training by refining how you rotate
muscle groups. To help you achieve your best results from every workout,
follow these suggestions:
 Always warm up. Do 10 to 15 minutes of light cardio (like walking or jog-
ging), and don’t forget the all-important stretching to avoid injury — see
“Flexibility training” for more info on the importance of stretching. After
you’re actively exercising, your body is warm, so it’s not necessary to
stretch between reps or exercises.
 Work large muscle groups before small ones. If you wait to work the
largest muscles last, you’ll be too tired, so work your muscles in this
general order: quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
 Work one muscle group before moving on to the next muscle group.
For example, perform all your quadriceps exercises first before moving
on to the hamstring for maximum muscle buildup and minimum muscle
fatigue.
When you’re starting out, choose one exercise for each muscle group
and do one set of 12 to 15 repetitions of each exercise. After a few weeks,
you may want to slightly increase the weight as well as perform another
set. At this point, individuals looking to increase strength may reduce
the number of repetitions to about 10 to 12 as they increase the weight
lifted.
 Make sure the weight is right for you. It’s not about how heavy the
weights are. The goal is being able to lift a weight heavy enough that
your muscle is tired or fatigued after 12 to 15 reps.
Muscle responds to resistance. Use a weight that’s too light and your
muscles don’t work hard enough; use a weight that’s too heavy and you
can damage your skeletal muscles and joints. For example, if you’re
doing a bicep curl with a 12-pound dumbbell, your goal is to do 12 to 15
repetitions per set. If the last few are a bit of a struggle, you know that
the weight is making your muscle work. If you can’t make it to 10 reps,
then go lighter. If 20 reps is a breeze, add more weight accordingly.
231
Chapter 11: Building and Fine-Tuning Healthy Muscles

 Get used to using weight machines (if you exercise at a gym) before
you use free weights. Free weights require a bit more coordination and
the use of more muscles to stabilize your body. Condition your muscles
using weight machines before moving on to free weights.
 Focus on your form. Good form is more effective than using heavier
weights, which leave you prone to injury. So for the first few weeks,
focus on doing each exercise correctly. If you’re using the right form,
you can maximize your workouts with lighter weights and in the long
run actually accelerate muscle strength. Also, talk to one of the staff at
the gym or hire a personal trainer to be sure your form is correct. Proper
form is critical. See the next section for tips on how to get proper form.
Preventing injury
If you’re new to strength training, make sure that you talk to a professional first
about your general fitness and health. In Chapter 9, we discuss key factors that
determine whether you should consult your doctor before beginning an exer-
cise program. If you don’t fit those parameters but are new to strength training,
and if you can afford it, we recommend that you have at least a couple of ses-
sions with a personal trainer to show you proper form, give you helpful guid-
ance, and answer any questions you may have.
In addition, buy or rent helpful videos to show you visual techniques on form.
To maximize your workout and help prevent injury, follow these guidelines:
 Align your body correctly. If you’re standing, your feet should be 
shoulder-width apart with your knees slightly bent.
 Mind your movements. Your movements should be slow and controlled.
You aren’t racing. Count to four, pause, and then return to your starting
position.
 Don’t forget to breathe. Your muscles need oxygen, so don’t hold your
breath. Breathe in at the beginning of the lift and exhale gently through
your mouth during the release of each weight.
 Especially in the beginning, be careful not to overtrain. “No pain no
gain” is not the motto for someone just starting an exercise program —
you can damage your muscles and joints if you overdo it. A muscle injury
in your first week of strength training can bum you out in no time, making
it harder to get back in the gym and back on track. We want you to suc-
ceed, so stick to a plan.
Overtraining not only causes muscle injury, but can also make you lose
your edge because if you’ve been progressively working out according
to a routine and you get injured, it takes time to recover from your injury.
During that time off, you’ll slowly begin to lose what you’ve gained. In
essence you’ll have to start not where you left off, but farther behind.
232
Part IV: Getting Physical 

 When you stretch, reach until you feel a bit of tension and hold it for
10 to 15 seconds. Slowly ease into the stretch to give your muscles time
to adjust. Never bounce or hold the stretch until you feel pain.
Recognizing when you need to back off
You may be pushing too hard. Here are some signs to look for to indicate
you’re overdoing it:
 Your performance goes down while your effort goes up
 You start losing body weight
 You start getting infections
 You’re constantly tired
 Your heart rate is elevated and you have an unpleasant burning sensa-
tion in your muscles
 You have difficulty sleeping
 You’ve lost your appetite
 You feel nauseous
If you think you’re overworking your muscles because you’re experiencing
one or more of these symptoms, stop working out and see your doctor.
Body transformation occurs by simultaneously gaining muscle through weight
training and losing fat through aerobics and diet. Particularly if you’re over-
weight, begin weight training as part of your doctor- approved routine today.
Many people falsely believe that adding weight training will either make you
look heavier or impede your weight loss.
Here’s the truth: Weight training helps promote weight loss because muscle
mass increases your metabolic rate, which directly aids in fat loss. For every
pound of muscle you add, your body can burn 30 to 50 more calories a day at
rest. Those burned calories are more likely to come from fat reserves, which
is really the whole point if your goal is to lose body fat.
Preventing and Treating 
Muscle-Related Injury
Even the best-trained athletes get hurt. While we’re not encouraging you to
injure yourself, you may sustain a sprain or strain from time to time. When it
happens, you need to treat the injury properly and not make it worse by 
233
Chapter 11: Building and Fine-Tuning Healthy Muscles

continuing to push ahead. In this section, we list some of the most common
strength-training-related injuries and recommendations for treating them.
If you injure yourself or experience persistent pain or swelling and your
symptoms don’t improve within a day or two, seek proper medical attention.
Joint aches and pains
You may feel a little sore all over if you’re a workout newbie. Your body expe-
riences many changes as it adjusts to the new demands you’re placing on it,
so be gentle if you’re sore the first couple of weeks. It’s better to ease up than
to quit.
If you continue to feel pain in your joints during a particular exercise, stop
and ask a fitness instructor for help. Chances are you may not be in proper
form. If your form is fine and you still feel joint pain, skip that exercise for
now. Ask the fitness instructor for an alternative exercise or for a suggestion
for warming up the joints to reduce the stress. If an alternate exercise also
causes pain to that particular joint, stop exercising the joint until you can
speak with a medical professional.
Very often the cause of joint pain is inflammation of the tendons, called ten-
donitis, or other soft and connective tissue. (Tendons connect muscle to
bone.) Ice therapy for 15 minutes three to four times a day can reduce 
inflammation.
Muscle strains and pulls
If you pull or strain your muscle, it’s going to hurt pretty badly because you’re
stretching your muscle fibers — like a rubber band — beyond their limits and
they tear. Yowza! Many actions can lead to muscle pulls, but the painful results
are all the same.
Sometimes when you have a severe pulled muscle or injury, you may notice
that your urine is brown. This happens due to the excretion of the protein
myoglobin that’s released when the muscle is damaged. Other symptoms 
are swelling of the muscles a day or two after the injury, stiffness, and of
course pain.
To treat muscle pulls, use the RICE method:
 Relative rest: Whatever you were doing to cause the muscle pull — stop!
You won’t feel much like doing that again anytime soon anyway. All you
need right now is some good, old-fashioned time for the muscle to heal.
Several days to several weeks isn’t an unusual timeframe, depending on
how many muscle fibers you tore.
234
Part IV: Getting Physical 

 Ice: Apply a bag of ice for 15-minute intervals several times a day. This
step reduces the swelling and pooling of fluids from leaky muscle cells
and blood vessels.
 Compression: Use an elastic bandage for compression to lessen the
swelling and constrict the injured blood vessels.
 Elevation: Let gravity do some of the work for you by keeping your
muscle elevated above your heart. This step helps keep fluids from 
pooling in the injured area, keeps swelling down, and helps plasma 
and fluids return to your heart.
Use the RICE method for the first 12 hours after you pull a muscle because
this timeframe is when most of the swelling occurs. After the swelling is
under control, apply heat to increase blood flow and promote healing.
Dealing with a sprain
Although people often use the terms interchangeably, sprains and strains are
two different things. A strain is an injury to a muscle; a sprain is an injury to a
ligament that attaches bone to bone.
235
Chapter 11: Building and Fine-Tuning Healthy Muscles
Relieving muscle soreness that isn’t injury-related
That all-over body ache you get after a strenu-
ous weight-lifting session may be partly due to
tiny tears in muscle fibers and a buildup of
waste materials in the muscles. Rest assured —
these tears are completely normal and heal on
their own. In the meantime, try one of these sug-
gestions for relief:
 Soak in a hot tub: Rest your muscles and
take a warm soak in the bathtub to loosen
your muscles and get blood flowing. Try
applying heat in the first 48 hours by bath,
water bottle, or heating pad. Be careful,
though — never go to sleep with a heating
pad on.
 Drink plenty of water: Always keep your
body hydrated, particularly after a workout.
Water can help keep your muscles from
cramping. Also, try eating a banana to get
some extra potassium because potassium
is essential for muscle activity.
 Get a massage: There’s nothing like the
power of healing touch, and a great mas-
sage by a licensed therapist (or even a
gentle rub from someone special) can make
a tremendous difference to your muscles —
and mind, body, and spirit — after a strenu-
ous workout.
 Take an anti-inflammatory: If you’re still
feeling muscle pain and soreness after a
few of these suggestions, you may want to
try an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory
such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen. If
you’re still having pain, your doctor may
prescribe a higher dose anti-inflammatory.
Talk to your doctor if you continue experiencing
muscle pain or soreness after five to seven
days.

Sprains can result in a lot of swelling. A severe sprain may tear the ligament
completely, and the joint will be swollen and discolored, and unable to bear
weight. You need to see your doctor to distinguish among a severe sprain,
strain, or fracture.
Treatment for sprains is similar to treatment for strains or pulls: rest, ice,
compression, and elevation (see the preceding section).

Your brain — you can’t live without it, but you may not appreciate it. It
guides you through tasks as simple as deciding what to have for break-
fast (No! Not the doughnut!) and as complex as putting together an unassem-
bled child’s toy. Brain power sends humans into outer space and to the bottom
of the ocean, regulates all your bodily functions, and helps you cross the street
safely, but you may take all these functions for granted until the brain stops
working as well as it once did.
The brain is the most complex and vital of all organs of the human body. Your
brain is command central for intelligence, and it defines and discerns your
senses, regulates your body movement, and controls your behavior. It’s also
responsible for the storage and retrieval of all your precious (and not-so-
precious) memories.
Your brain has tremendous — some scientists would say almost unlimited —
potential to learn, remember, improvise and create, and its secrets are better
understood today than ever before. But your brain does change as you age,
as you know all too well if you’ve ever gone into a room and forgotten what
you went there for. Understanding how and why those brain changes occur
helps you minimize their effect on your daily activities.
Want to keep your brain young, healthy, active, and beautiful? We can’t help
with the beautiful part, but in this chapter, you go inside your brain for a look
at how it works and how to keep your brain functioning at maximum potential

as you age. We also touch on some brain changes outside the normal range
that may concern you, such as Alzheimer’s, dementia, stroke and Parkinson’s
disease.

discovering what the brain does. In all honesty, scientists still don’t under-
stand all the inner workings of the brain. In this section, we describe the basic
anatomy (no, there won’t be a test) and functioning of the different parts of
the brain. We try to break down the brain anatomy simply, so you can get an
idea of the complex computer that runs your body. Understanding which part
of the brain controls which activity may help you understand why certain
activities cause you difficulty as you become older.
Researchers have discovered more in the last decade than the previous cen-
tury because of the advancement in technology and funding for newer pro-
jects. The baby boomers have ignited the demand and accelerated the efforts
to get more information on the brain. This group is interested in being active
both mentally and physically past the traditional retirement age. Many are
working into their 60s and 70s and are thriving on new options for healthy
aging.
Dividing the brain into 
three governing areas
The brain divides into three areas: the forebrain, midbrain, and the hindbrain.
The hindbrain controls your basic involuntary functions, such as heartbeat
and breathing as well as balance and coordination; the midbrain helps control
reflexes and your senses; and the biggest part of the brain, the forebrain, con-
trols higher functions such as thinking, planning, and emotions. In the next
sections, we explain the brain and its divisions in detail.
The forebrain, your body’s command central
The forebrain is the largest part of the brain, covering most of the top of your
head, and also the most developed, controlling most of the intellectual activi-
ties. Collectively, the forebrain functions to control cognitive, sensory and
motor function, and regulate temperature, reproductive functions, eating,
sleeping, and the display of emotions.
The forebrain consists primarily of the cerebrum, which is typically the part
of the brain that you see in pictures. The cerebrum is divided into two hemi-
spheres that have different responsibilities but are always in communication
240
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

through a large network of nerve fibers (these hemispheres are physically
separate entities). The unique functions that each hemisphere controls are 
as follows:
 The right side of the brain controls the left side of the body. It controls
spatial orientation (the ability to know where you are) and facial recog-
nition, among many other things. The right side of the brain allows for
music, art, and other creative activity.
 The left side of the brain controls the right side of the body. It generally
controls language functions. Where the right side controls creativity, the
left side of your brain is the more analytical side, used for math and logic.
The left and right hemispheres of the cerebrum are divided into four lobes,
which drive most of your body’s functions. The following details of the
actions of the lobes as well as their location in your brain may be helpful (see
Figure 12-1):
 Frontal lobe: The front-most portion of the brain is responsible for high-
order functioning, reasoning, production of speech, and has influence on
personality, emotions, and movement.
 Temporal lobes: Located laterally on the brain (your temples), the tem-
poral lobes contain the primary audio cortex, where information from
the auditory nerve from the ear is processed. This area is associated
with perception, memory, and speech.

Chapter 12: Keeping Your Mind and Memory in Tip-Top Shape

 Parietal lobe: Located on the top-back surface of the brain, the parietal
lobe is primarily concerned with integrating sensory information and
spatial orientation.
 Occipital lobe: The occipital lobe, located at the back of the brain, is
devoted almost entirely to visual processing.
The forebrain further breaks down into specific parts with crucial duties:
 The amygdala: This part contains a large number of opiate receptors
that help control emotion and is responsible for emotional integration of
sensory input and memories.
 The diencephalon: The diencephalon is the posterior part of the fore-
brain. It contains the hypothalamus and thalamus.
• The hypothalamus regulates and drives emotions, and stabilizes
your internal environment.
• The thalamus relays sensory signals, processes memory, and gen-
erates emotional status. It also coordinates information with the
temporal lobes and serves a primary function in memory.
 The hippocampus: This part is responsible for the processing and coor-
dination of memory function.
 The limbic system: The limbic system encompasses a number of brain
structures involved with the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems.
The amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and thalamus (see previ-
ous bullets) make up just a few of the many areas of the limbic system.
The midbrain, where senses are stimulated
The midbrain, also called the mesencephalon, is the uppermost part of the
brainstem. It extends from the base of the brain to the spinal cord and con-
tains the tectum and tegmentum. The midbrain serves as a motor relay
center and contains auditory and visual reflex centers. It is involved in func-
tions such as vision, hearing, and eye and body movement. One disease that
is associated with the midbrain is Parkinson’s disease, which affects the 
substantia nigra area of the midbrain. Some of the important parts of the
mibrain are
 Cerebral peduncles: These two bundles of fibers carry signals between
the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. They also relay informa-
tion to and from the cerebellum.
 Substantia nigra: Found at the base of the midbrain, the substantia nigra
receives input from numerous other brain parts and is involved in relay-
ing signals concerned with motor function to parts of the brain, as well
as serves as a source of dopamine production.
242
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

The hindbrain, your center for equilibrium and more
The hindbrain, located at the rear of the brain, includes three major divisions:
the cerebellum, medulla, and pons, which together function to support many
of the vital bodily functions explained in the following list:
 Cerebellum: The cerebellum coordinates musculoskeletal movements
and stores memories of movement patterns. It indirectly regulates motor
control by comparing intention with performance and making necessary
changes to the nervous signals that go to the muscles.
 Pons: The pons, which means bridge, connects the brainstem and the
cerebellum. The pons accepts information from the visual centers of the
brain and relays this info to the cerebellum to aid in equilibrium and
muscular movements. The pons also plays a role in arousal and sleep.
 Medulla: The medulla lies between the pons and the spinal cord. It’s
responsible for essential bodily functions such as breathing, swallowing,
and maintaining muscle tone.
The hindbrain also contains the upper part of the spinal cord.
Understanding how the brain 
communicates with the body
Although neurotransmitters sound like they belong in your iPod instead of
your brain, they’re actually essential components in getting signals from one
part of your brain to another. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are used to
transmit, intensify, and alter electrical signals between a neuron and another
cell. There are a range of specific chemicals involved in various aspects of
mental and physical functioning. You couldn’t live without these 
neurotransmitters:
 Acetylcholine: This chemical affects voluntary movement of muscles,
behavior, inhibition, and memory. Alzheimer’s memory loss may be
associated with decreased or blocked acetylcholine levels.
 Dopamine: Dopamine excites and controls voluntary movement and
emotional arousal; Parkinson’s disease symptoms may result from
decreased or damaged dopamine levels.
 GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid): GABA is responsible for inhibition
of motor neurons.
 Glycine: Glycine impacts spinal reflexes and motor behavior.
 Neuromodulators: These chemicals are responsible for sensory trans-
mission, especially pain.
243
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Mind and Memory in Tip-Top Shape

 Norepinephrine: This one is responsible for wakefulness or arousal. It 
is released from the adrenal gland and is most prevalent in the sympa-
thetic nervous system.
 Serotonin: This neurotransmitter affects memory, emotions, wakefulness,
sleep, and temperature regulation. It’s part of the brain’s reward system,
producing feelings of pleasure.
Sixty percent of all adults over age 40 have some degree of neurotransmitter
deficiency for several reasons. Aging neurons make smaller amounts of cer-
tain chemicals. Also, as you get older, your body doesn’t respond as well to
the signals as well as it used to, for some of the following reasons:
 Prolonged emotional or physical stress: Your body is designed to
handle short bursts of stress. Chronic stress takes a toll on the “fight 
or flight” stress hormones and neurotransmitters of the sympathetic
nervous system, eventually depleting them. The neurotransmitter epi-
nephrine and the hormone cortisol, which are released in stress situa-
tions, lead to decreases in memory and learning when chronically
stimulated under stress. Researchers are continuing to look into their
roles in chronic stress and how this effects aging.
 Chronic dieting: This habit is a common self-induced form of neuro-
transmitter depletion because of its affect on serotonin levels. Serotonin
deficiency increases cravings, moodiness, and poor motivation. Many of
the fad diets are at higher risk of serotonin involvement.
 Disrupted sleep: There are several neurotransmitters responsible for
sleep, especially serotonin. Serotonin converts to melatonin, which is
the main sleep hormone. When serotonin levels are low, melatonin 
levels will also be low. This results in disrupted sleep, causing fewer 
neurotransmitters to be produced, perpetuating a vicious cycle.
 Hormone imbalances: Hormones are highly influential on neurotransmit-
ter release. Aging in both sexes is associated with progressive declines in
hormones and associated effects on energy, sleep, mood, libido, and
weight.
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a classic example of how low serotonin
levels can temporarily shift each month. Mood, appetite, and sleep can
be severely disrupted one to two weeks before the menstrual cycle.
A Microscopic Look at the Aging Brain
Keeping your brain function intact is probably high on your list of things to
do as you age. Age can affect the complicated system of hormones, neuro-
transmitters, and nerves. In fact, the changes that can occur in the brain can
244
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

be much more debilitating than some of the physical aspects of aging such as
muscle and bone loss. In the next section, we look at exactly what happens to
your brain as you age.
Normal physical changes
The ability to study the brain used to be limited to autopsies, but new brain
imaging techniques have led to increased observation of age-related effects
on the brain’s structure and appearance.
The brain shrinks, the white matter thins, and the vital messengers in the brain
diminish. Sounds scary, doesn’t it? But relax! In most instances, you can com-
pensate for age-related brain changes. You can expect the following as your
brain ages:
 The brain’s weight and volume decrease.
On average, the brain loses 10 percent of its weight, starting after the
age of 20 with the abundance of loss coming after the age of 60.
 The sulci (grooves) on the surface of the brain widen.
 The brain starts to generate fewer messengers (the neurotransmitters).
 The brain can get accumulations of abnormal brain fibers made of pro-
tein, which are called neurofibrillary tangles. These plaques can cause
Alzheimer’s symptoms and are thought to contribute to age-related
memory deficits.
 The accumulation of deposits of amyloid, an insoluble fibrous protein, in
the brain cells is called senile plaques. Research is still not conclusive as
to whether these plaques are part of normal aging.
How physical changes manifest 
through your mentality
There’s a saying related to aging that goes “Of all the things I’ve lost, I miss
my mind the most.” This saying is a humorous way of stating that memory
loss is a common part of aging. One of the biggest fears people have of aging
is losing their ability to think and remember. In regards to aging and the
mind/body connection, a few categories of people exist:
 People who have a strong healthy body but are losing their minds
 Folks who are sharp as a tack with a deteriorating body
 The strong-bodied and strong-minded
245
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Mind and Memory in Tip-Top Shape

The good news is that most people will be able to keep their cognitive facul-
ties as they age unless they develop Alzheimer’s or some other disease.
Can you live into your 80s or 90s with your mind still sharp? As long as your
brain itself remains healthy, the older version of you can stay as mentally
sharp as ever, although certain activities may take you longer than they used
to. The next sections help you determine whether changes you experience
are cause for concern or part of the normal aging process.
Changes in mental function that are part of normal aging
Despite common belief, your memory doesn’t worsen as you age. Memory
does, however, change with age and these changes don’t necessarily mean
deterioration. In fact, memory becomes more accurate with age; you’re just 
a bit slower at the processing part.
The most common normal change associated with aging is the ability to
retrieve newly acquired information. In other words, your long-term memo-
ries remain intact, where as your short-term memory slows down.
So, when do all of these brain aging and short-term memory glitches start to
occur? About 60 percent of people age 50 and older notice greater difficulty
remembering names, dates, and other specific details. Memories associated
with a specific time and place are most commonly effected. Thankfully, these
small memory lapses — which are called brain farts as young adults or senior
moments as you get older — aren’t usually signs of a neurological disorder,
such as Alzheimer’s disease, but instead the result of normal changes in the
structure and function of your brain.
Understand that memory difficulties caused by the normal aging process are
minor, even if you find them frustrating. (Most people don’t have difficulties
with their activities of daily living, but for the less fortunate there are also
many things you can do to protect and improve your memory; we cover 
them in the section “Keeping Your Brain Young” later in this chapter.)
Changes in mental function that may signify a health concern
Aging alone isn’t the only cause of mental changes. Depression, dementia,
side effects of drugs and alcohol, strokes, and head injury also cause mental
changes, but these diseases aren’t a universal occurrence. This leads us to
the question, if some mental change is normal as you age, when should you
be concerned and seek medical advice?
Don’t panic. Ask yourself (or someone else, if you’re not able to assess for
yourself) if you’re having any of the following changes in behavior or thinking
processes. Often the mental changes that aren’t part of normal aging progress
much more rapidly leading to more elective doctor visits. If you notice one or
more of these signs in yourself or a loved one, or if someone tells you they’ve
noticed these behaviors in you, see your healthcare professional for a full
evaluation:
246
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

 Forgetting things more frequently than you used to (especially if a
friend or family member tells you): This may not seem like a big deal,
but forgetting things can be annoying, and, in some cases, like taking
medications, it can be dangerous. You may stop taking medications 
or take the wrong ones or forget directions and get lost while driving or
walking.
 Forgetting how to do familiar tasks: Your nutrition may suffer if you
can’t prepare food properly or if you eat the same thing every day.
There’s also the danger of forgetting to turn off the stove or leaving
water running.
 Difficulty learning new tasks: You need to be able to master new tasks
to compensate for some of the normal changes that occur with age. In
brain disease, the ability to learn and compensate are compromised,
which can make daily activities difficult.
 Being told that you told the same story within the same visit: This isn’t
particularly dangerous, although it may annoy your friends and relatives!
 Difficulty managing money, medications, and bills: Aging adults are
already major targets for money schemes and fraud. Those with brain
disease or deterioration are even more susceptible to making bad pur-
chases or losing track of their money. Families should make sure that
there are safeguards in place to protect from these situations.
 Changes in personality such as anger or avoidance: Often the frustra-
tion of losing the ability to care for yourself is frightening and can cause
people to lash out or become reclusive. This can lead to depression and
stressors that can make mental deficits accelerate.
 Decreased hygiene: Being unable to bathe and take care of other hygiene
issues can lead to infections in areas, such as the urinary tract or skin.
Infections in aging adults with brain disease can cause worsening symp-
toms and can be difficult to diagnose because the changes may be
assumed to be from the disease itself. Untreated infections can spread
into the bloodstream and cause more serious infections with a high 
mortality rate.
There are other causes of abnormal mental function besides brain dis-
ease. Infections, medications, and other diseases can cause similar
symptoms, so make sure that you or a loved one is evaluated by a
doctor to get an accurate diagnosis if symptoms appear suddenly or
seem to become worse.
Identifying and Coping with Brain Disease
Recognizing abnormal mental changes in yourself or someone you care about
can be frightening, but it’s important to identify them early and get treatment
to prevent as much loss of brain function as possible.
247
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Mind and Memory in Tip-Top Shape

Many diseases that cause altered mental behaviors result from direct damage
to areas of the brain. Some of the diseases that can occur as you age are
dementia (a loss of mental ability severe enough to interfere with normal
activities of daily living), Alzheimer’s (a specific type of dementia), stroke,
Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s Chorea (a genetic disease where symptoms
don’t appear until middle age).
Damage to the brain from stroke, Alzheimer’s, or diseases such as
Parkinson’s have different effects depending on the area of the brain that’s
damaged. These damages are covered in the following section.
Recognizing the most common 
forms of brain disease
Brain disease encompasses a large group of symptoms that collectively result
in loss of both mental and physical function. These symptoms can occur
gradually or quickly and in some incidences can be slowed once the cause of
the brain disease is identified. Brain disease can cause a decline in memory
and cognition, balance, speech, gait, or even some autonomic brain func-
tions, such as blinking, smiling, and swallowing
Dementia
As many as one percent of people age 60 suffer from dementia, and the fre-
quency of dementia has been estimated to double every five years thereafter.
Dementia isn’t a specific disease; it’s a group of symptoms. To be diagnosed
with dementia requires more than just memory loss. People with dementia
have attention, orientation, memory, judgment, language, motor and spatial
skills, and function defects severe enough to seriously affect their daily lives.
Some of the most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease, vas-
cular dementia (damage to the blood vessels leading to the brain), brain
injury, and brain tumors.
There are several marked differences between memory loss associated with
aging and dementia. With normal aging, you’re consciously aware when you
can’t remember something. You can also compensate for the loss of a word
by substituting the idea with a similar concept. The person who has demen-
tia may not be aware of these problems even when it is severe enough to
change a person’s mood and personality.
Vascular dementia occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted for any
reason and is sometimes called multi-infarct dementia. Brain cells can die
from lack of oxygen, causing symptoms such as muscle weakness, speech 
difficulties, and other mental disturbances. Vascular dementia is the 
248
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

second-leading cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s. Whether it’s small block-
ages (strokes or mini-strokes) or just severe blood vessel disease, when
blood and nutrients can’t get to the brain, cognitive impairment occurs.
A person with dementia should be under a doctor’s care. For some people in
the early and middle stages of Alzheimer’s disease, certain medications can
be prescribed to possibly delay the worsening of some of the disease’s symp-
toms. See a healthcare professional for a full evaluation if you notice one or
more of these signs of dementia in yourself or a loved one:
 Recent memory loss: Many of the problems associated with dementia
are caused by memory loss. Everyone forgets things for a while and then
remembers them later. People with dementia often forget things, but
they never remember them. They not only forget an object but also the
context surrounding that object.
 Difficulty performing familiar tasks: People with dementia may forget
how to cook a meal that they’ve prepared multiple times. They may have
problems with dressing, color coordinating, and personal hygiene (all
routines in the past).
 Problems with language: Folks suffering from dementia may forget simple
words or use the wrong words or even add unusual words. This often
makes conversations hard to follow.
 Time and place disorientation: People who have dementia get lost often.
They can drive away, forget where they’re going, and then get lost trying
to return home. Some get confused whether it’s night or day.
 Problems with abstract thinking: Dementia sufferers may forget what
numbers are and what has to be done with them.
 Misplacing things: Some people may put things in the wrong places. Often
they’re trying to hide objects and then forget where they hid them. Hiding
objects is a response to feeling the loss of control and insecurity based
on memory loss. As the disease progresses, they have difficulty remem-
bering who they know and who they can trust. They don’t realize that
this hiding things to “keep them safe” may backfire when they can’t
remember where they hid them — or even that they hid them.
 Changes in mood: People with dementia may have fast mood swings and
can cover many in a short period. Some folks can become very angry, sad,
and then seem happier than ever.
 Personality changes: These folks may become irritable, suspicious, or
fearful.
 Loss of initiative: People who have dementia may become passive and
don’t like to go places.

Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease is a specific form of dementia that currently affects more
than 5 million Americans, most over age 65. Twenty percent of dementia
cases are diagnosed as Alzheimer’s, which first appears between the ages of
40 and 60 in some people and affects only 10 percent of people in their 60s,
but affects nearly 50 percent of those in their 80s.
Alzheimer’s gradually destroys a person’s memory and ability to learn, reason,
make judgments, communicate, and carry out daily activities. As Alzheimer’s
progresses, individuals may also experience changes in personality and
behavior, such as anxiety, suspiciousness or agitation, as well as delusions 
or hallucinations. Currently, there’s no cure for Alzheimer’s, although a few
drug treatments slow progression in some people.
Alzheimer’s causes a buildup of extracellular plaque in the brain, neuron loss
in the cerebral cortex and deep cerebral regions, and brain atrophy (see
Figure 12-2). An abnormal collection of a protein called amyloid is found in
the areas of the brain crucial to learning, memory, and maintaining a sense 
of time.
A Canadian study done in 2002 showed that Alzheimer’s was frequently pre-
ceded by a decline in verbal memory one to two years before the disease
became obvious, so it’s important for a person to be tested for Alzheimer’s
disease early in the disease process. That testing can help in early identifica-
tion and treatment of potential Alzheimer patients.
Alzheimer’s can be difficult to diagnose, especially in its early stages; it is not
just a more severe form of dementia. The diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease
not only requires memory deficits but also another cognitive deficit, such as
language disturbance.
Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between normal age-related
changes and signs of one of the brain diseases. The table below lists a few of
the differences between normal aging and Alzheimer’s.

Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s is a progressive, degenerative brain disease caused by the loss of
dopamine-producing brain cells. The part of the brain where these nerve cells
are located, the substantia nigra, is responsible for controlling muscle move-
ment. Normally these nerve cells release dopamine, a neurotransmitter that
signals other parts of the brain to coordinate muscle to make controlled
movements. Loss of these nerve cells leads to difficulty with muscle move-
ments. Everyone will experience some loss of these dopamine-releasing nerve
cells, but people with Parkinson’s lose more than 50 percent of their cells.
Parkinson’s causes tremor, muscle rigidity that results in a “mask–like” facial
expression, postural instability, and bradykinesia (slow movements).
Depression, emotional changes, and difficulty swallowing and speaking are
also common symptoms. This is a progressive, disabling disease, but many
people have many quality years of life after diagnosis.
Much research has been done on the cause of Parkinson’s; it’s believed to be
a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some medications and
other diseases can cause Parkinson’s–like symptoms in people who don’t have
the disease. There’s a familial link for the disease, although it’s a weak link.

Huntington’s disease
Huntington’s disease (HD), first described by Dr. Huntington in 1872, is still a
disease with many unknowns. This genetic disease is a progressive, neuro-
logic disease that unfortunately doesn’t show symptoms until you’re in your
late 30s or older. In HD, a reduction in the amount of the neurotransmitters
acetylcholine and GABA affects the amount of dopamine in the brain. The
increased amounts of dopamine and the muscle movements are the opposite
of Parkinson’s, where there’s a deficiency of dopamine. The initial symptoms
start with clumsiness and then develop into strange posturing and uncontrol-
lable movements.
Most HD patients also develop progressive dementia and memory loss. HD is
usually fatal within 15 to 20 years after symptoms begin. Death is a result of
disabilities, such as swallowing, which can lead to choking, or by secondary
infection from a impaired immune system.
HD is a genetic disease caused by a dominant gene (a genetic trait is consid-
ered dominant when the disease is present in a person who has only one
copy of that gene, received from one parent) which means that anyone that
receives the gene from either parent will develop the disease.
Sizing up your risk for brain disease
Some of your risks of developing brain disease are within your control, and
then some are simply a result or your genetic make-up. Of course, common
lifestyle choices consistently found to be a risk of disease can also cause
brain disease. We discuss the specific risks for the common brain diseases 
in the following sections.
Risk factors for dementia
Dementia has the same risk factors common to people who suffer strokes. In
fact, a study of over 8,000 people by the University of California–San Francisco
indicated that cardiovascular risks such as smoking, high cholesterol, hyper-
tension, and diabetes at midlife were also risks for development of dementia
in later life. Folks with all four risk factors were almost two and a half times
more likely to develop dementia, and each single risk factor resulted in a 20
to 40 percent increase. People with severe or repeated head injuries also have
an increased risk for dementia.
Risk factors for Alzheimer’s
A family history of Alzheimer’s and increasing age are considered risk factors
for development of Alzheimer’s disease, but they don’t always lead to memory
loss or dementia. Lifestyle and environment actually seem to be more influen-
tial than genes for some individuals.
252
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

Even though a known cause of Alzheimer’s isn’t yet found, a number of fac-
tors have been found to occur frequently in Alzheimer’s patients. Experts
suspect that some combination of the following can predispose a person to
develop Alzheimer’s:
 Family history of the disease (especially a parent or a sibling)
 Heart-disease risk factors — high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, dia-
betes, high cholesterol
 Previous head injury
 Environmental toxins
 Advancing age
 Stress
 Genes
A gene variant called APOE E4 may be a risk factor, but only about 30
percent of people with Alzheimer’s have this gene; other people with
Alzheimer’s don’t.
The presence of any of these risk factors doesn’t mean that you’ll get
Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, researchers can say only that these factors have
been associated with many Alzheimer’s patients. Take “advancing age” as an
example. It’s listed as a risk factor only because Alzheimer’s disease usually
strikes individuals after age 65. Aging alone doesn’t cause the disease and
what does is still not quite known.
To find out more about Alzheimer’s, go to www.alz.org on the Web, or
check out Alzheimer’s For Dummies (Wiley) by Patricia B. Smith, Mary M.
Kenan, PsyD., Mark Edwin Kunik, MD, MPH, and Leeza Gibbons.
Risk factors for Parkinson’s disease
Age is the biggest risk factor for Parkinson’s and is more common in people
over age 60, affecting 1 in 200 persons. Gender statistics show that more men
than women are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. There’s a very slight
(less than 5 percent) hereditary risk if you have a first-degree family relative.
There has been concern that low levels of estrogen in post-menopausal
women that choose not to take hormone replacement could result in an
increased risk of Parkinson’s.
Risk factors for Huntington’s disease
HD, a chromosome defect, is found in approximately 5 in 100,000 people and
affects men and women equally. HD is an autosomal dominant disease, which
means you need to have only a copy of the gene from one parent to inherit
the disease. Nearly all cases of HD are found in people with a family history
253
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Mind and Memory in Tip-Top Shape

of the disease; it’s possible to test for HD genetically, but is controversial
because there’s no cure and can cause significant distress if you have no
symptoms and are found to be a carrier. You should see your medical doctor
and a genetic counselor for more information.
Understanding the treatment options
Brain disease is a feared development of aging. It can follow a slow progres-
sion or become disabling very rapidly, leaving you feeling hopeless and scared.
The good news is that treatments can sometimes improve quality of life for
years. Make sure that you get a thorough evaluation to determine treatment
options that are available and to make sure to rule out other causes of your
symptoms. Some of the treatments for the common brain diseases are as 
follows:
 Dementia: Treatment options include the following:
• Surgical treatment of a brain tumor
• Medical treatment for an infection or stroke
• Prescription of vitamins for a deficiency
 Alzheimer’s: Treatments for Alzheimer’s include
• Drug treatments to increase the level of acetylcholine in the brain:
Menantine (Namenda)
Rivastigmine tartrate (Exelon)
Tacrine (Cognex)
Donepezil (Aricept)
Galantamine (Reminyl)
• Promising research currently under investigation to create new
drugs to prevent neuron damage before it occurs, preventing
Alzheimer’s instead of treating symptoms after they appear
 Parkinson’s disease: Many treatment options include
• Medications that provide symptomatic relief in a majority of
Parkinson’s patients. Patients are often given levodopa-carbidopa
(Sinemet), a combination drug; levodopa is converted to dopamine
in the brain and carbidopa slows the breakdown of levodopa so
that more of it reaches the brain. This drug is most effective
against rigidity and bradykinesia, less so against tremors.
• Drugs called anticholinergics may help reduce tremors, and drugs
that mimic the action of dopamine in the brain, such as bromocrip-
tine, may also be used.

• The FDA recently approved a treatment called deep brain stimula-
tion (DBS), which involves planting electrodes into the brain. The
electrodes are then connected to a small electrical device called a
pulse generator that can be externally programmed to help reduce
symptoms.

• There’s no one treatment for HD.
• Drug treatment is usually directed at decreasing symptoms.
Keeping Your Brain Young
So, you want to be as young as you think? There are certain steps you can
take to keep the cobwebs in your mind at bay as you get older. At least the
signs of an aging brain aren’t as visible as gray hair and wrinkles! In this sec-
tion, we provide you with ways to keep your brain power strong.
Preventing age-related memory loss
The brain changes that come with age are inevitable — but they don’t have
to slow you down or trip you up. What can you do to minimize the impact of
neurotransmitter deficiencies, as you age? There are some medical, natural,
and nutritional ways to increase and balance neurotransmitters when they 
do get out of balance.
Be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before taking any medica-
tions, supplements, or beginning any other therapies for treating any per-
ceived neurotransmitter deficiencies.
Check out these ways of staying alert and preventing memory loss:
 Exercising your mind: Similar to the way your body needs physical
activity, your mind needs to be exercised, too. Mental stimulation and
exercises can actually protect against cognitive losses. Most severe
mental decline is from the disease processes instead of normal age-
related function loss because as you age, the brain is able to make 
new connections if it’s challenged and taken care of. Here are a few 
ways that you can challenge yourself:
• Play a musical instrument.
• Do crossword puzzles or other challenging board games.
• Socialize with family and friends.
255
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Mind and Memory in Tip-Top Shape

• Start a new hobby.
• Stay interested and up to date on current events.
 Staying physically active: Regular exercise can improve blood flow to
the brain. Exercise increases your metabolism and energy levels, which
can help improve your attention span. If you exercise for as little as 30 to
45 minutes three times a week, studies show that you can improve age-
related declines in your cognitive abilities.
 Eating brain foods: Neurotransmitter health requires the same balanced
diet as the rest of your body — protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Three
neurotransmitters are especially important to keep your brain function-
ing well:
• Acetylcholine: Foods rich in this chemical include egg yolks,
peanuts, wheat germ, liver, meat, fish, milk, cheese, broccoli, 
cabbage, and cauliflower.
• Dopamine: These foods include all proteins, such as meat, milk
products, fish, beans, nuts, and soy products.
• Serotonin: Serotonin-rich foods are carbohydrate-based, such as
pasta, starchy vegetables, potatoes, cereals, and breads.
What else can you ingest to make that brain of yours healthy? Here are
some tips:
• Eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Many of these foods contain
antioxidants — substances that protect and nourish brain cells.
Antioxidants may help prevent cholesterol from damaging the
lining of your arteries and slowing blood flow to your brain.
• Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon and other cold-
water fish. Eating fish at least once each week seems to protect
against the cognitive decline associated with aging.
• Drink plenty of water. The brain is comprised of more water than
any other organ in the body, at about 90 percent. Staying hydrated
is essential for concentration and mental alertness, but how much
water is enough? A good rule of thumb is to drink half of your body
weight in ounces of water. If you drink coffee or alcohol, you have
to add those ounces onto the total.
• Eat smaller, more frequent meals to increase your mental alertness.
By eating smaller meals, there’s less variations in the blood flow to
the digestive tract and also more balance in blood sugars.
 Drinking alcohol only in moderation: People who drink heavily for years
are at a higher risk of developing memory problems and dementia. We
don’t recommend drinking more than one to two drinks per day for men
and one or less per day for women.
256
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

 Stopping smoking: Smoking is associated with dementia and one Dutch
study found that smokers had twice the risk of developing Alzheimer’s
compared to those who never smoked. Smoking also has an increased
risk of strokes, the other common type of dementia (multi-infarct).
 Managing your stress: Stress can cause the release of enzymes and hor-
mones that can effect judgment and memory. Protein kinase C, cortisol,
and corticosterone are a few that are thought to have a memory- 
impairing effect. These hormones are released in the body under normal
stress situations, but it’s not until they hang around too long as a result
of chronic stressors that they affect memory. A certain amount of stress
is normal, but finding ways to manage and reduce stress helps keep
these hormones in a normal cycle.
 Protecting your head when exercising: Head trauma can increase your
risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. People who participate in sports
such as running and swimming, which have a reduced risk of head
trauma, have lower rates of memory loss. Take precautions to protect
your head; for example, wear a helmet when riding your bike or perform-
ing other extreme sports.
 Getting enough rest: New evidence suggests that a regular pattern of
eight hours of sleep per night helps protect you against age-related
memory loss. Getting enough sleep can be a problem as you get older
because of the age-related changes in sleep stages and sleep hygiene
(see Chapter 14 for more info on age-related sleep changes). Sleep
experts say that having a regular sleep routine can improve cognition.
Several studies discuss the similarities of sleep deprivation and age-
related memory loss, but they’re still researching the long-term effects
of poor sleep and memory loss.
Improving Your Memory
What you consider a poor memory may just be less-than-effective habits when
it comes to taking in and processing information. Barring disease, disorder, or
injury, you can improve your ability to discover and retain information.
What type of memory are you losing?
Memory loss with normal aging results from the subtly changing environment
within the brain. It’s not clear exactly how much is actual memory loss and
how much is the inability to quickly process the request for the information.
After a certain period of trying to remember something, you may give up or
recall that piece of info when it’s no longer needed . . . but it was there.
257
Chapter 12: Keeping Your Mind and Memory in Tip-Top Shape

Memory studies have shown that about 30 percent of healthy people over
age 60 have difficulty with declarative memory. To help explain the differ-
ences between age-related memory loss and memory loss associated with
brain disease, we discuss the different types of memory below:
 Declarative: This refers to memory that’s consciously available. It’s the
type of memory that stores facts such as names, places, and times.
Declarative memory is also referred to as conscious or cognitive memory
and what most people refer to when they’re experiencing lapses in their
memory function.
 Nondeclarative or procedural: This type of memory relates to skills and
routines. It consists of memory associated with motor learning, habits,
perception, intuition, and conditioning. This area isn’t affected much 
by aging.
 Sensory: This type of memory involves retaining something you have
just seen or heard. It gives you the ability to see something for just a
second and memorize it. Sensory memory isn’t affected by aging as
much as the other types of memory.
 Short-term: Short-term memory allows you to recall something from sev-
eral seconds to as long as a minute without repetition. This area can be
significantly affected by aging. This type is also one that can be improved
with memory games and brain exercises.
 Long-term: Long-term memory can store much larger quantities of infor-
mation for potentially unlimited duration — sometimes a whole lifetime.
This area is little affected by normal aging.
Try putting some new information in your brain “next to” something you know
you won’t forget so you can retrieve it more easily. For example, if you meet
someone new and want to remember his name is Robert, think of someone
from your past or a childhood friend named Robert and create an association,
then lock it down in your memory.
Figuring out how to remember
A good percentage of aging adults develop age-related memory loss, while
some end up with the more aggressive memory deficits seen in diseases like
Alzheimer’s. Learning tools to help increase your ability to remember and
recall, however, can help you retain as much of your thinking ability as possi-
ble. The following hints may help you remember important information:
 Create memorable mental pictures and notes: You remember things
more easily if you can visualize them. If you’re reading something and
you read it out loud, you may retain it easier. Try to relate substance to
items, such as colors, emotions, and textures, which can make more of
an imprint in the brain.
258
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

 Group things: Group any new information to already stored info because
it’s easier to remember the group.
 Organize: Place objects such as keys in the same place. Use calendars
for events and recurring occasions. Take notes, especially on complex
material, and add pictures and colors to the notes to increase recall.
 Repeat learned items: The more times you repeat things or say them, the
better the memory. After you meet someone, repeating the name out loud
increases your ability to retain.
Exercising your mind is similar to exercising your muscles. Your memory is
adaptable, pliable and you can get it in shape with a little knowledge, effort,
energy, and a lot of fun! There are many Web sites dedicated to a variety of
brain health programs for sharpening your noodle and maximizing your
memory, as well as video games and some surprising other sources. 
Chapter 18 shows you a few that we found at the time of this printing.

A
re you stressed? Of course you are — all human beings are stressed, but
that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Stress is a necessary part of life. Hans
Selye, MD, who did considerable research on the effects of stress on daily life,
defined stress as “the nonspecific response of the body to any demand.” This
means that any event, from winning the lottery to slamming the car door on
your hand, causes stress of some type.
Stress generally falls into one of two categories:
 Eustress, which is “good” stress, or stress occurring from positive
events, such as moving into a new house or having a new grandchild
 Distress, which is stress resulting from negative events, such as losing a
job or having health problems
Stress can be life saving; it activates the reactions that result in your jumping
out of the way of a speeding car or grabbing onto a tree branch if you’re falling.
However, if your stress reactions are activated too often, stress can become
chronic. Instead of leveling off after the crisis passes, your stress hormones,
heart rate, and blood pressure remain elevated. Extended or repeated activa-
tion of the stress response takes a heavy toll on your body and accelerates the
aging process. In this chapter, we show you how to recognize and decrease
chronic stress — as well as how to live well with the stress that’s a necessary
part of life.

Your Body’s Built-In Response System:
How It’s Supposed to Work
Human bodies were designed for stress. The autonomic nervous system, 
consisting of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, continually
attempts to balance your physical and emotional reactions to stress. Both
distress and eustress cause physical and mental adaptations, such as an
increase in your heart rate, dilation of your pupils, and a rise in your blood
sugar. These responses are orchestrated by your sympathetic nervous
system, and allow you to respond quickly to any changes in your world by
helping you move faster, see better, and think quickly.
Each time your body experiences stress, the same biological and physiological
responses are set off in a chain reaction known as the stress syndrome. Walter
Cannon was the first to describe the body’s basic sympathetic response to a
stressor in the 1920s and then it was expanded on by Hans Selye in 1936. This
sympathetic reaction became the first stage of the stress reaction syndrome.
Stress isn’t meant to be a chronic condition. After the perceived “danger” has
passed, the parasympathetic nervous system normally takes over, allowing
your body to revert back to its normal “non-stressed” state.
Here are the stages of stress:
 Stage 1: Alarm: The initial response to stress is the “fight or flight”
response. Your sympathetic nervous system pumps out adrenaline 
(epinephrine), a chemical produced by the adrenal glands, which
increases your heart rate and blood flow to your muscles and brain.
Blood vessels under your skin constrict to prevent blood loss in case 
of injury. The pupils in your eyes dilate to improve vision. Then, a spike
in blood sugar gives you a quick burst of energy. After the cause of the
stress is removed, your body should return to normal. If the cause for
the stress isn’t removed, you move on to the second stage.
 Stage 2: Adaptation: In this stage, your body responds by building a
resistance against and adapting to the stress. Adrenaline release slows
and the effects of the alarm phase lessen. The adrenal cortex produces
hormones called corticosteroids (cortisol and aldosterone) for this 
resistance reaction.
During this phase you adapt to the stressor, whether it’s a loud startling
noise or someone assaulting you. Most of the time the stressor resolves,
the alarm phase slowly resolves, and the sympathetic and parasympa-
thetic nervous systems equalize. When your body experiences an excess
exposure to this stage without periods of rest, you become prone to
fatigue, irritability, and lethargy, and your concentration lapses.
262
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

 Stage 3: Exhaustion: In the final stage, your body has run out of its
reserve of energy. You reach the point of adrenal exhaustion, as your
adrenal glands, which produce the hormone adrenaline, become depleted.
Blood sugar levels drop and this combination leads to decreased stress
tolerance, progressive mental and physical exhaustion, illness, and even-
tually collapse, which has an aging effect due to wear and tear on your
body. You have now become the victim of chronic stress. (This stage isn’t
typically reached with minor stressors.) The reactions to stressors differ
from person to person and you may reach exhaustion quicker than 
someone else.
The adrenals are walnut-sized glands located on top of each kidney, and
are important control centers for many of the body’s hormones. The
outer layer of the gland, called the adrenal cortex, produces hormones,
including cortisol, DHEA, estrogen, and testosterone. The centers of the
glands produce adrenaline, the hormone named after them.
Observing the Tolls of Chronic Stress
In today’s fast-paced world, many events can initiate a stress reaction. 
If your life lurches from perceived crisis to crisis, your ability to wind down
after the immediate danger has passed becomes damaged. This reaction 
happens quite often with today’s busy lifestyles. Chronic stress occurs when
acute stress responses keep your body on alert continuously, not allowing it
to return to a state of homeostasis, the scientific name for the balanced state
of health. If you’re faced with continuous stressors, over time, the sympa-
thetic system becomes overwhelmed. When that happens, stress can cause
serious mental and physical health issues. Chronic stress can be especially
damaging as you age.
Recognizing chronic stress is the first step to combating its negative effects 
on your life. After you identify the symptoms, you can develop techniques to
cope with it without being overwhelmed by it — in this section, we familiarize
you with the gamut of common symptoms.
The physical effects
Chronic stress can take a heavy physical toll. The ongoing stress response
causes the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to release a chemical known as
ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). ACTH, known as the “stress hormone,”
stimulates the adrenal gland to produce and release cortisol and stress can
keep cortisol at an increased level.
263
Chapter 13: Decreasing Stress to Live a Longer, Better Life

Cortisol is responsible for helping with many of the body’s functions, but the
functions are different when cortisol is released in response to stress than
when it’s released in normal situations. Normally, cortisol helps with glucose
metabolism, controlling inflammation, boosting the immune system, and regu-
lating blood pressure. Cortisol released under stress can give you an extra
burst of energy and can depress your response to pain. However, when corti-
sol release is prolonged due to chronic stress, it can have adverse effects on
your body. (See “The mental and psychological effects” section in this chapter
for more about cortisol’s negative stress effects.) Cortisol levels are typically
lowest during the night and highest in the morning, with a peak level at
around 7:00 a.m.
Some studies show that 43 percent of all adults suffer adverse health effects
from stress. Seventy-five to 90 percent of all doctor’s office visits are for
stress-related ailments and complaints.
Stress can contribute to many physical problems:
 Arthritis and vague aches and pains
 Asthma or breathlessness
 Being accident-prone
 Clenched muscles
 Diabetes
 Fatigue
 Headaches and migraines
 Heart problems, such as a racing heart
 Hypertension (high blood pressure)
 Increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs
 Insomnia
 Premature aging of immune system cells that causes accelerated aging
in the following areas:
• Impaired cognitive performance
• Suppressed thyroid function
• Blood sugar imbalances such as hyperglycemia
• Decreased bone density
• Decrease in muscle tissue
• Higher blood pressure
264
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

• Lowered immunity and inflammatory responses in the body, which
leads to more frequent colds, upper-respiratory infections, and
other illnesses
• Increased abdominal fat, which is associated with heart attacks,
strokes, the development of higher levels of “bad” cholesterol
(LDL) and lower levels of “good” cholesterol (HDL)
 Rapid weight changes
 Skin conditions, such as acne breakouts, hives, rashes, and excessive
sweating
 Stomach problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, and
nausea
Stress is no longer believed to cause stomach ulcers, but stress is still
thought to aggravate and exacerbate up to 45 percent of ulcers.
 Teeth grinding
Continual stress response and the hormonal influences can produce inflam-
mation and are most commonly associated with worsening of autoimmune or
inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, and
inflammatory bowel disease. Some hormones, including the glucocorticoids,
are known to be immunosuppressive, meaning they suppress your immune
system — not something you want when you’re trying to heal.
The mental and psychological effects
Too much stress can upset your mental health. For example, the persistent
stress-induced elevations of cortisol, which affects hormone neurotransmit-
ters and the formation of free radicals, can contribute to age-related disor-
ders including Alzheimer’s disease and late-life depression.
The following are some general mental and psychological effects of chronic
stress:
 Mental symptoms
• Persistent negative thoughts
• Indecisiveness
• Poor memory
• Boredom
265
Chapter 13: Decreasing Stress to Live a Longer, Better Life

• Loss of concentration
• Bad dreams
• Poor decision making
 Emotional symptoms
• Irritability
• Anxiety and worry
• Mood swings
• Crying spells
• Tension
• Lack of enthusiasm
• Cynicism
• Feelings of alienation
• Loss of confidence
• A general sense of dissatisfaction

Putting your happiness hormones to work
Studies show that optimistic people are happier
than pessimistic people, and being happy is
good for your health. When you’re happy, your
endocrine glands secrete hormones that create
pleasurable feelings into your bloodstream.
While pleasurable feelings are nice, these hor-
mones do far more than just make you feel
good. They also can boost your immune system,
reduce stress, modulate your appetite, and
increase the release of sex hormones. Two of
the most important hormones for happiness and
good health are listed here:
 Endorphins: Released by the pituitary gland,
endorphins are known as the “happy brain”
chemical. Endorphins are natural opiates
that promote feelings of intense pleasure;
the euphoric state known as a “runner’s
high” is caused by endorphin release.
Exercise, laughter, and certain foods —
such as chocolate (but didn’t you always
know that?) and chili peppers — also cause
endorphin release. Endorphins also act as
a natural painkiller; they’re three times more
powerful at blocking pain than the narcotic
morphine.
Endorphins bind to the opioid receptors in
neurons that cause pain sensations. (These
are the same receptors that painkillers like
morphine bind to.) Endorphins block the
release of neurotransmitters, which means
pain signals can’t reach your brain.
 Seratonin: Serotonin is a neurotransmitter
that’s manufactured in your brain and gas-
trointestinal tract using the amino acid tryp-
tophan, which is the chemical in your
Thanksgiving Day turkey that makes you
sleepy and gives you a feeling of well-being.
Serotonin helps with sleep, calming anxiety,
and relieving depression.

 Behavioral symptoms
• Unsociability
• Restlessness
• Changes in eating habits
• Changes in exercise habits
• Changes in sleeping habits
Understanding the Big Picture: Why
Chronic Stress Is a Concern as You Age
The relationship between the mind and body’s reaction to stress and its
effect on your mental health is complex, particularly as you age. Stress often
accompanies change, and certainly many changes accompany aging — both
internally and externally. Changes in socioeconomic status, physical health
and abilities, and family support are among the stressful life events com-
monly experienced by people as they age. The body is already experiencing
normal age-related changes and when you compound that with chronic
stress reactions, the results can be dangerous for some.
The effects of chronic stress are especially serious as you age; here are a few
reasons why:
 As you get older, your brain slowly loses its ability to regulate hormone
levels. As we explain in the previous section, stress makes hormone levels
go all out of whack anyway, but those unbalanced levels are prolonged
with age, which directly leads to health problems — the longer your brain
has been exposed to stress hormones, the more possibility for damage.
For example, high, prolonged levels of cortisol in the bloodstream accel-
erate the aging of healthy muscle and bone, and slow down healing and
normal cell regeneration. The raised blood pressure and heart rate end
up placing stress on the heart’s vessels and accelerate the onset of heart
disease. In addition, an excess of cortisol over your lifetime can damage
the hippocampus, a part of your brain that’s crucial for storing and
retrieving memories (see Chapter 12). Studies show that high cortisol
levels correlate to poor memory.
 The normal biological responses to stress, such as rapid heartbeat
and an increase in blood pressure, don’t return to normal as quickly
as you age. Long-term stress creates added wear and tear on the body.
In fact, data suggests that long-term stress can increase a person’s risk
of heart attack and sudden death (in persons already susceptible to
these health issues).
267
Chapter 13: Decreasing Stress to Live a Longer, Better Life

 When the levels of stress neurotransmitters rise in response to chronic
stress, parts of the immune system are impaired. Duration of illnesses 
or infections can be prolonged due to changes in the white blood cells
(immune cells). These effects suppress the immune system as a whole
and leave the body susceptible to viral infections.
Women in particular are more susceptible to an overload of stress 
hormones as they age. In fact, the impact of age on cortisol levels is
nearly three times stronger for women than for men. So, as women 
continue to be employed in higher-stress occupations, they need to 
pay special attention to the potential effects of stress on the body.
Measuring Stress
Are you feeling like you’re more stressed than usual, or more stressed than
other people? Have you reached the point where everything seems to send
you into a state of adrenaline-pumping emergency? A simple self test can help
you identify the times when your stress levels are shooting out of control, as
well as give you some tools for calming yourself down.
If your stress levels are out of control, a professional evaluation may help you
get a better handle on the stressors in your life, as well as give you guidance
on how best to manage them — we explain how to seek that guidance in this
section as well.
Paying attention to your stress response
Much of the stress of daily life can be planned for ahead of time. Do you drive
to work every day? It’s a pretty safe guess that traffic is going to be a daily
stressor for you. Baby-sit your grandchild once a week? Spilled milk and
temper tantrums may be on your weekly stress list, too.
Staying in tune with your body and becoming more aware of stress symptoms
when they first appear can help you begin to relax before your stress levels
are out of control. Watch for the following signs of increased stress:
 Are you a clencher? Check your body for tension to see whether you’re
clenching your muscles. Start at the top of your head and work your way
down. Feel the muscles in your face, jaw, and neck. Move down to your
shoulders, chest, and back. Keep moving your way down to your arms,
hands, and torso. Do you feel tension in your thighs, calves, feet, or toes?
268
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

 Do your hands get cold? Place your hand on the side of your neck just
above your collar. If your hand is noticeably cooler than your neck, your
hand temperature indicates that your body is probably stressed.
 Do you sweat? Excessive sweating is an involuntary stress response
caused by the secretion of certain stress hormones. Many people 
perspire when they’re tense.
 Does your pulse race? If your heart is beating above 100 beats per
minute(bpm) without exertion, chances are good that your body is
responding to stress. Most people at rest have a pulse rate between 
60 to 80 bpm, although some have a resting pulse as high as 100 bpm.
 Do you have rapid breathing? Rapid, shallow breathing indicates ten-
sion. When you’re tense, you tighten your stomach muscles and breathe
through your chest, which isn’t very expandable. When you’re relaxed,
your breathing is slow and deep with your stomach muscles relaxed.
 Do you ruminate about things? If you’re constantly thinking about the
same thing over and over in your mind day in and day out, it may also
be a sign of a stressor. Ruminating can be a tipoff that you need to
reduce the amount of time that you’re focusing on something.
Defusing your stressors
Some stressors are inevitable and tough to completely eliminate — wild 
children at home, a difficult boss, and a long, hectic drive into the office are
just a few examples. You may not be able to get a grip on how to handle these
stressors without help; if you could do it alone, most likely you would’ve
taken care of it already.
Sometimes brainstorming with a friend or family member can help you find 
a solution. For instance, if you have a nightmare commute to and from work,
find a co-worker who’s willing to carpool, or offer to pay for gas and catch a
ride with someone. (Make sure that riding with the co-worker doesn’t cause
more stress than it relieves!) Consider taking the bus or train part of the way.
If you’re stressed at home, talk to your family to find ways to allow you to 
balance your need to be with the family against your need for some occa-
sional downtime. You may find that taking the train home gives you time to
both unwind and avoid the stress of driving through hair-raising traffic — 
two stressors eliminated in one easy change!
The important point is to recognize your stressors and then look for ways to
modify them. Coauthor Dr. Agin sees a large portion of his patients for issues
regarding stress and how to cope. It’s a common problem; just acknowledging
the stress is the first step toward making the decisions that can help you 
control it.
269

Working through Stress 
with a Professional
Sometimes chronic stress has such a stranglehold on your life that you 
need professional help in releasing its grip. Fortunately, medical profession-
als and therapists can help you recognize and deal with stress that’s become
too much for you to handle. You may find some of these tools used at stress
management workshops as well.
A professional may use interviews and standardized stress questionnaires 
to help assess the frequency and amount of stress in your daily routine and
then guide your therapy and treatment accordingly. The following are just 
a sample of the kinds of evaluations and therapies available:
 Daily Stress Inventory: The Daily Stress Inventory is a self-reporting tool
for patients. They provide a daily assessment of the sources and personal
impact of relatively minor stressful events. This test concentrates on rec-
ognizing the small but cumulative stress-inducing events of daily life —
things you don’t consider major sources of stress. Because these are
everyday events or activities, you may not realize the stress that they 
can cause. Tools like this one point out these stressors and can open your
eyes to the fact that you may have more on your plate than you thought.
 The Hassles and Uplifts Scales (HSUP): This test presents a new way of
looking at stress by measuring attitudes about daily situations categorized
as hassles and uplifts. In it, you see the many items that you consider to be
hassles and find ways to balance these items with the uplifts. This tool
steers away from measuring major life stressors and concentrates on find-
ing ways to evaluate and more effectively cope with the highs and lows in
your everyday life.
 Biofeedback: Biofeedback uses machines (electronic instruments) to
monitor your body’s specific, often unconscious physiological activities
and habit patterns. The doctor uses your reactions to create awareness
of your physical responses to stress, which helps teach you to modify
your reactions. A biofeedback stress test performed by a physician 
measures the following vital signs:
• Heart rate
• Blood pressure
• Breathing rate
• Brain waves
• Muscle tension
270
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

• Skin resistance
• Temperature
When you’re aware of the physical changes that accompany stressors, you
can recognize the beginnings of stress before it gets out of hand and utilize
stress- release techniques until your body is no longer reacting adversely to
the stressor.
Making Personal Strides to Reduce Stress
Learning to manage and reduce your stress load may improve the quality of
your life, and give you a better chance to live a long and healthier one. Lots of
tools, tips, and techniques can help you reduce stress and figure out how to
relax. Recognizing stress is the first and hardest thing for many people to do.
Finding and focusing on sources of stress is helpful, because you’re concen-
trating on what you can do to change rather than letting stress continue to
grow until it’s out of control.
Most of the time, if you need professional help with stress, it’s because 
you let the unrecognized stress build for too long. If you’re ready to start
reducing stress on your own, think about your life, find the stressors, and
then develop a way to manage them. Although the key to successful stress
reduction is maintaining a positive attitude, picking a technique that works
for you is critical. We encourage you to explore the techniques in this section
and try a few on for size — you’ll know when one fits.
With a little practice and creativity, you can reduce your stress levels and
soon look forward to the newfound pleasure of relaxing your mind and body
with the help of one of these stress busters.
Accentuating the positive
Researchers say that the people with more positive attitudes may deal with
stress better and have a stronger will to live. People who feel good about
themselves as they get older live about seven and a half years longer than the
bitter, negative types.
How can you keep a positive attitude? Two things that help are
 Accepting that you can’t control some events in your life
 Being assertive and positive instead of aggressive in stressful situations
271
Chapter 13: Decreasing Stress to Live a Longer, Better Life

Part of staying positive is being able to see humor in situations, including
those that may normally stress you out. Laughter really is the best medicine
when it comes to reducing your stress. Laughing reduces the production of
cortisol (which accelerates aging) and increases the level of health-enhancing
hormones like endorphins and neurotransmitters. Laughter also increases
the number of antibody-producing cells and enhances the effectiveness of 
T cells. What that boils down to is a stronger immune system and fewer 
physical effects from stress.
Employing self-relaxation techniques
It’s easy to say “Just relax” when your stress levels are building, but it’s easier
to do if you’ve developed some relaxation techniques. Try the following 
methods of self relaxation:
 Practicing breathing techniques: Deep, slow breathing — the kind that
reaches all the way into your gut, moving your abdomen out and in — is
one of the easiest and most cleansing stress relievers with a variety of
body-benefits. Deep breathing helps oxygenate your blood, which “wakes
up” your brain, relaxes your muscles, and quiets your mind. You focus 
on relaxing your body and releasing air on each breath. Deep breathing is
easy to practice because you can breathe anywhere, and it works quickly
to relieve your stress.
 Meditating your way to peace: Meditation builds on the technique of
deep breathing and goes one step farther. After you master the technique
of slow, deep, cleansing breaths to calm your body and restore and calm
your breathing to a normal, relaxed state, you can begin to meditate. 
In some forms of meditation, your brain enters a state that’s similar to
sleep, but it carries some added benefits that you can’t achieve as well in
any other state, including the release of certain hormones that promote
health. In other meditation techniques, the focus is on recognizing and
accepting your feelings in the moment without trying to change them and
without dwelling on them.
During meditation, you clear your mind of any focus or distraction. This
enables you to detach from stressors and restores your body to a state of
calm, essentially giving your body time to repair itself. Breathing returns
to normal, so you use oxygen more efficiently. Your heart rate slows down,
your blood pressure comes down, and anxiety levels decrease, so you
sweat less.
A tremendous benefit of meditation for anti-aging is that your adrenal
glands produce less cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, which have
been associated with negative effects on aging. By relaxing the body in
this manner, you prevent damage from the physical effects of stress. You
272

also make additional positive hormones and your immune function
improves.

Dean Ornish, MD (Wiley), for more info.
 Practicing guided imagery and visualization: Guided imagery and 
visualization techniques involve envisioning a relaxing scene or picturing
yourself achieving goals or increasing your performance in some specific
way. People who practice guided imagery go into a deeply relaxed state
that provides significant stress-reduction benefits, including physically
relaxing the body quickly and efficiently.
 Hypnotizing yourself: Self-hypnosis incorporates some of the features
of guided imagery and visualization (see the preceding bullet), with 
the added benefit of enabling you to communicate directly with your
subconscious mind. Hypnosis can be a valuable tool in helping you 
overcome fears, withstand pain, or reduce stress in your life. Self- 
hypnosis, however, may take some practice and training with a profes-
sional to make sure that you discover how to initiate and then come 
out of the session.
 Practicing progressive muscle relaxation: By tensing and relaxing all
the muscle groups in your body you can relieve tension and feel much
more relaxed in minutes, with no special training or equipment. Follow
these steps:
1. Start by tensing all the muscles in your face, holding a tight gri-
mace for ten seconds.
2. Completely relax the muscles from Step 1 for ten seconds.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with your neck, followed by your shoul-
ders, and so on, all the way down to your toes.
You can do this exercise anywhere, and as you practice, you’ll
notice that you can relax more quickly and easily, reducing tension
as quickly as it starts.
 Calming yourself with music: Music can be a powerful tool to aid relax-
ation and relieve stress. Music therapy has shown numerous health 
benefits for people with conditions ranging from stress to cancer. Music
has been found to have an impact on hormones and neurotransmitters
in the brain and has direct anxiety-lowering actions. Listening to, per-
forming, or writing music can lower your blood pressure, relax your
body, and calm your mind. It’s often used as part of stress-management
programs or in conjunction with exercise and is used in a variety of
healthcare settings with good results for dealing with illness and stress.
Music therapy is an emerging field, one whose benefits are just now
starting to be realized.

Exploring your thoughts through journaling
Writing in a journal is a therapeutic self-expression of your thoughts, feelings,
and life events, and it can be a powerful tool for self evaluation. Keeping nega-
tive feelings and thoughts inside isn’t healthy, but many people don’t feel 
comfortable expressing themselves or don’t have anyone to confide in. As a
stress-management tool, journaling helps you detail specific stressors, as well
as how you think and feel about them. Journaling allows you to clarify your
thoughts and feelings in order to gain valuable self-knowledge.
To use journaling as therapy, write down all aspects of a stressor rather than
just bits and pieces. Be consistent — don’t skip several days or occurrences.
Journaling for therapy is different from keeping a daily event journal in which
you chronicle everything that you did in a day. Therapeutic journaling allows
you to focus on issues that need to be addressed; these issues become evi-
dent as you write down things that come to mind after you’ve given yourself
time to clear your thoughts. You’ll be surprised at what thoughts are linger-
ing in your brain that, when released and examined, can give you a wonderful
sense of well-being and freedom from stress.
Journaling is also a great way to keep track of where you are in your life. 
By reading what you wrote only a year or two ago, you can see how much
progress you’ve made in different areas of your life. It’s also helpful to see
that concerns that loomed so large a year or two ago are now forgotten.
Journaling helps keep things in perspective.
Journaling can be a good problem-solving tool. Putting pen to paper has a
tremendous way of helping you resolve problems and come up with solutions.
Writing about traumatic events helps you process them by fully exploring and
releasing the emotions involved and by engaging both hemispheres of the
brain in the process, allowing the experience to become fully integrated in
your mind.
Exercising away your stress
Exercise is one of your body’s best natural cures for stress. It leads to the
release of endorphins, which has a healing effect on the body and mind and
protects against some of the harmful effects of stress. Researchers have
found that those who exercise have fewer stress-related health problems,
which provides a positive impact on healthy aging.
Exercise can be as simple as a walk around your neighborhood every evening
or as complicated as working out with a personal trainer. Find the type of
exercise that works for you and your body. For example, swimming is a great
exercise if you suffer from arthritis and can’t tolerate the joint-pounding
strain of aerobic exercise. You may also find riding a stationary bike easier
than running a marathon.

Yoga, anyone?
Yoga is an ancient path to spiritual growth. Today, yoga is a broad term for a
series of personal stretches and exercises that bring together your physical,
mental, and spiritual aspects of life. Yoga teaches you a series of stationary
and moving poses called asanas and a form of breathing known as pranayama,
as well as concentration techniques to help you get in tune with your body,
your mind, and your emotions in the present moment. You can find a lot of 
different schools of yoga, but they all have the goal of attaining a state of
wholeness and completeness.
Yoga is designed to balance the different systems of your body. By taking your
mind off the causes of stress, and having you gently stretch your body in ways
that massage your internal organs, yoga helps you create an inner peace.
People of all ages can benefit from regular yoga practices, and with the vari-
ous schools and the ability to change the poses, yoga can be adjusted to fit
physical limitations and other complications.
For more information on yoga, check out Yoga For Dummies (Wiley) by Georg
Feuerstein, Larry Payne, and Lilias Folan.
Working out in the bedroom
People often joke that the most uptight and stressed-out people may lighten
up a bit if they just had sex. But there’s truth there — the benefits of sex in
stress reduction are plentiful. These benefits include deep breathing, lowering
blood pressure, decreasing anxiety, getting a physical workout, and feeling 
a pleasurable sense of touch.
Most people feel the least like having sex when they’re stressed out, but it’s
worth giving it some extra effort. Sexual activity releases endorphins and
other feel-good hormones that put a smile on your face in no time. Sex has
other health benefits as well (lucky you, right?), and we discuss them in
Chapter 15.
Tossing out poor habits
When you’re feeling stressed, it’s natural to look for ways to cope. However,
some of the things you turn to when stressed may actually be more destructive
or create more stress on your body than you’re relieving, creating a vicious
cycle. Three coping mechanisms that fall into this category are caffeine, 
nicotine, and alcohol.
Eliminating caffeine
Consider eliminating or at least decreasing your caffeine intake. Caffeine is a
drug and a stimulant and may cause your body to react as it would to stress
by increasing your heart rate and blood pressure. Consuming caffeine may
275
Chapter 13: Decreasing Stress to Live a Longer, Better Life

also accentuate the symptoms that you experience during panic attacks.
We’re not telling you to eliminate your morning wake-up routine, but be aware
of caffeine’s potential symptoms. Many people have no problems with coffee
intake in moderation (2 cups per day), but too much coffee can have systemic
effects that may mimic or potentiate stress. The other option for diehard
coffee drinkers is to drink unleaded (decaf) fuel. If you can’t give up caffeine
altogether, find a balance between regular and decaffeinated by switching 
to decaf after two regular coffees.
Dr. Agin always tells his patients to avoid consuming anything that requires
you to taper off. The need to taper means that you’ve become dependent on
something and may experience withdrawal symptoms when you stop abruptly.
If you do decide to eliminate caffeine, do so gradually, because you may have
headaches, sweats, and some irritability.
Avoiding nicotine
During times of stress, smokers often reach for a cigarette to calm down, but
nicotine is actually a stimulant. Nicotine increases blood pressure, heart rate,
and respiration, and stimulates the central nervous system. Nicotine has a
stimulatory effect on the brain and can cause the release of neurotransmit-
ters and endorphins that give a temporary feeling of energy and well-being.
Most smokers have become dependent on nicotine and need it to maintain
normal moods. They often suffer from unpleasant feelings of irritability and
tension between cigarettes, when nicotine levels in the blood are falling.
People often feel that they can’t stop smoking when they’re under stress
because the act of smoking is therapeutic and reduces stress levels. Some also
use smoking as a timeout from problem situations; this learned behavior is the
largest reason people give for continuing smoking. Smoking in social settings
may reduce stress by giving smokers something to do with their hands and
something to look at. The laughter and the socializing can also be therapeutic,
but smokers will attribute their stress reduction to smoking. Lastly, smoking
may produce a short-term reduction of stress because it removes the stress
caused by nicotine withdrawal symptoms from the last cigarette you smoked.
Nicotine withdrawal causes an initial increase in anxiety and stress, so choos-
ing the right time to quit is important. Right before your daughter’s wedding,
for example, may not be the best time!
Holding alcohol consumption to a moderate level
The messages on alcohol use and stress are mixed. Some studies have found
that alcohol itself can actually trigger the stress response. But other studies
suggest that low levels of alcohol can reduce stress, tension, and anxiety.
Moderate drinking has even been shown to improve your mood. So which 
is it? Does drinking help ease stress or make it worse?
276
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

Although low doses of alcohol have been shown to reduce stress, research
has shown that alcohol induces some of the same physiological effects as
other stressors:
 It interferes with the stages of sleep and can lead to sleeping difficulties
(see Chapter 14 for more information).
 It numbs your emotions, impairing your ability to cope with stressful 
situations.
 In excess, it can lead to social isolation, anger, depression, and paranoia.
Alcohol isn’t a healthy way of coping with stress. Drinking to deal with stress
can interfere with work, relationships, and finances, and it can lead to more
problems, like alcoholism and health complications. So, instead of drinking,
which is avoiding the problem, try to make constructive changes that will deal
with the problems directly and make you feel better about yourself without
subjecting you to the health risks of heavy drinking. The various techniques
we discuss in this chapter can help you develop better coping skills.
Bringing out the kid in you
Life should be fun, and participating in activities you enjoy is a great way to
relax and decrease stress. Having hobbies and outside interests keeps you
connected and engaged with the world outside yourself.
Board games, puzzles, online games, crossword puzzles, and other fun activi-
ties can bring added joy and happiness to life, and they can be a great way to
relieve stress. When you get really engrossed in an activity you enjoy, such as
putting a puzzle together, you can experience a state of being know as flow, in
which your brain is in a near-meditative state. This state benefits your body,
mind, and soul.
Your stress level and your happiness benefit from at least one activity that
you do regularly just for fun. Hobbies and games provide a fun way to
sharpen skills, express your creativity, or just blow off steam.

ZZZ . . . The Infinite Importance 
of a Good Night’s Sleep
In This Chapter
 Checking out the how and the why of sound sleep
 Noting the effects of aging on sleep
 Mastering your sleep rhythm
 Overcoming sleep disorders and health risks
T
he business of helping people catch some ZZZs has mushroomed — to say
the least — over the past few decades. Pharmaceutical companies promise
immediate sleep with a tiny pill, while books on meditation and relaxation
promise restful sleep with a simple “Ohmmm” and a lavender-scented candle.
Mattress companies have cashed in, luring the weary with promises of a good
night’s rest based on numbers designating mattress firmness and materials
that mold to your body, and major hotel chains tempt guests with soft pillow
tops and ever fancier bedding. As a result, people feel like a good night’s 
sleep is impossible without pharmaceutical aides, a guru, self-adjustable air
mattresses, Swedish contour foam pillows, combed Egyptian cotton sheets,
and half a dozen strategically placed body pillows.
And yet, even with all this help, sleep remains elusive. People can’t get
enough of it. We’re not talking about the occasional restless night; we’re talk-
ing insomnia (the inability to sleep well for an extended period of time, such
as weeks and months) and the restlessness and early awakenings that often
accompany aging.
Lack of sleep significantly affects a person’s mental and physical health, 
even more so as the years creep along. In this chapter, we cover the basics on
the importance of sleep, its changes due to the aging process, and your own
body’s sleep rhythms, including a discussion on bona fide sleep disorders, 
the real spoilers in the aging process. So whether you’re an okay sleeper or 
a major sleep-deprived soul lugging from one day to the next, this chapter can
help you toward a better night’s sleep — every night.

Why Adequate Sleep Is 
Crucial to Your Health
Sleep is nature’s restoration period. While you sleep, your body restores your
immune system, your nervous system, and even your muscular and skeletal
systems. Certain hormones and brain-related proteins also restore while you
sleep. So, if you don’t sleep well or enough (or both), your body doesn’t get
the time it needs to rejuvenate itself, and it slowly lags behind in its optimal
ability to function — over the long haul, you function less than optimally with
many systems affected. Studies have shown that lack of sleep can lead to
immune dysfunction and disrupted hormone regulation. Sleep deprivation 
is a form of stress on your body; you’re not regulating the hormones that can
lead to long-term problems with chronic stress (see Chapter 13 for more
information on the effects of stress).
The end result? If you sleep well, you wake up refreshed and energized; how-
ever, if you don’t get enough sleep, sleep too long, or the quality of your sleep
is compromised, you may be affected in one or more of the following ways:
 You wake up grumpy and sluggish.
 You’re downright unproductive.
 Poor sleep can affect your health, your relationships, and your work.
 Prolonged poor sleep has also been linked to diabetes, obesity, heart
disease, and premature aging.
280
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 
The deadly danger of sleep deprivation
The fatigue that accompanies lack of sleep also
makes you dangerous on the road. People who
are tired are more likely to be involved in car
accidents. Quite literally your life can depend on
good sleep. Many studies make it clear that
sleep deprivation is dangerous. Sleep-deprived
people who are tested by using a driving simu-
lator or by performing a hand-eye coordination
task perform as badly as or worse than those
who are intoxicated. Sleep deprivation also
magnifies alcohol’s effects on the body, so a
fatigued person who drinks will become much
more impaired than someone who’s well rested.
Driver fatigue is responsible for an estimated
100,000 motor vehicle accidents and 1,500 deaths
each year, according to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. Because drowsi-
ness is the brain’s last step before falling asleep,
driving while drowsy can — and often does —
lead to disaster. Caffeine and other stimulants
can’t overcome the effects of severe sleep depri-
vation. The National Sleep Foundation says that
if you have trouble keeping your eyes focused, if
you can’t stop yawning, or if you can’t remember
driving the last few miles, you’re probably too
drowsy to drive safely.

 Sleep deprivation has been linked to anxiety disorders.
 You may not be able to deal with the small irritations of daily life.
 Drowsiness affects your work productivity, your ability to relate to
others, and your attendance record.
 At home, you may be irritable and grouchy with your spouse, children,
or friends.
 You can be a danger to yourself and others.
Men and women face different issues when it comes to sleep, but the end
result is the same. It doesn’t matter what the cause of sleep deprivation is;
what matters is the quantity and quality of your sleep. Many things disrupt
sleep quality or quantity; all make for painful days at the office, home, or
wherever you’re struggling to keep those lids open. Some notorious sleep
problems are gender specific; for example, women deal with the following:
 Pregnancy: Sleep can be a problem for pregnant women, especially
toward the end of pregnancy, when finding a comfortable sleeping 
position becomes difficult.
 Baby’s feeding schedules: After the baby arrives, waking up in the
middle of the night to feed and change the baby becomes a common
occurrence for most women (and, yes, many men experience this too).
 Menopause: Women get hit again by the insomnia monster before 
and during menopause when nightly hot flashes can keep them awake
for hours.
Men handle these situations:
 Middle age: Men get less restful sleep in middle age and that can 
contribute to conditions like diabetes and heart disease.
 Sleep apnea: Men are more at risk of developing sleep apnea — a life-
threatening and, at the very least, severely-sleep-depriving condition 
in which a person stops breathing repeatedly during the night.
 Prostate problems: Many men need to get up at night to urinate due 
to an enlarged prostate, and that interferes with good sleep.
How Sleep Does Its Job
Although you don’t remember it, your sleep time is really a time of tremen-
dous activity. A lot of maintenance work goes on in the body and particularly
in the brain during those “off” hours. The body has a built-in cycle that’s sup-
posed to operate efficiently to get you sleeping well and prepared to face the
next day, but several factors can alter this cycle and keep people frustrated
and sleepy eyed.
281
Chapter 14: ZZZ . . . The Infinite Importance of a Good Night's Sleep

In short, there are two types of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) and non-
rapid eye movement (NREM). NREM comprises four stages and accounts for
about 80 percent of sleep. As you sleep, you enter into sleep cycles that con-
tain both REM and NREM sleep. For the first 75 to 80 minutes, you’re in NREM,
and then you reach REM for about 15 to 20 minutes before the cycle starts
over. The average person goes through four to six cycles per night. These
cycles usually last around 90 minutes but can last up to 100 minutes and are
important in figuring out the amount of sleep that you need. If you sleep well
and don’t use an alarm clock, you’re likely to find that you wake up at times
that are multiples of the 90-minute sleep cycle. For example, you may wake 
up after 41⁄2, 6, or 71⁄2 hours.
Many sleep experts direct you to figure your sleep needs in 90-minute incre-
ments. You want to complete each 90-minute cycle, because the slightest
alteration of these sleep stages is enough to make you feel sleep deprived.
The next sections cover what happens in each of the sleep phases.
The structured phases: NREM 
sleep (stages 1-4)
NREM sleep is known as dreamless sleep — how boring! So what’s the 
purpose of NREM, you might ask? Your body is actually accomplishing some
important tasks during NREM, although they may not seem very exciting.
NREM puts you in relaxation mode; your pulse and blood pressure drop, and
you have minimal eye movement during this stage. The body does its repair
work during NREM, which is subdivided into four stages:
 Stage one: This stage usually lasts less than 10 minutes. Stage one is
your body’s introduction to sleep — your breathing, brain waves, and
muscles slow down — your blood pressure falls. In this stage, you may
experience muscle contractions (hypnotic jerks) that suddenly jolt 
you out of sleep. These muscle contractions sometimes make you feel
like you’re about to fall or trip. They’re weird but perfectly normal and 
usually occur as you transition from being awake to going to sleep.
Your eyes are closed during stage one sleep, but if someone wakes you
up, you often feel as though you haven’t slept at all. People who suffer
from insomnia spend more time in this first stage of sleep.
 Stage two: In this stage, your brain waves slow down even more, but
they’re occasionally interrupted by a cluster of fast-moving waves. Your
eye movements, which were slowing down in stage one, stop altogether.
You spend about 40 minutes of your sleep cycle in stage two sleep.
282
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

If someone wakes you up while you’re in stage two sleep, you may not
be particularly happy about it, but you won’t be the walking dead either.
When you take the occasional short nap, you enter stage two sleep. You
awake refreshed but you couldn’t survive on naps alone.
 Stages three and four: These two stages are characterized by the
appearance of very slow brain waves (delta waves). Delta wave sleep is
the deepest sleep you achieve throughout the sleep cycle. The main 
difference between stages three and four is the amount of delta waves
that occur. Stage three usually contains less than 50 percent of the sleep
waves as delta waves while stage 4 has more than 50 percent of it’s
waves as slow delta waves. Delta waves are mixed with faster waves in
an up-and-down pattern. In these stages, it can sometimes take a very
loud noise to wake you up.
When you finally reach stages three and four, your body does a lot of its
repair work — the longer you stay in these stages, the more refreshed
you feel in the morning. During this time, hormone levels and brain
chemicals are restored. If someone wakes you up while you’re in this
stage, you’re groggy and disoriented for quite some time. This is also 
the deep sleep when children wet the bed and sleepwalk.
You stay in deep sleep for about 20 minutes of each of your sleep cycles
and then you move on to the most interesting part of the night — the
dream stage.
The random dreaming phase: REM
The last sleep stage is REM sleep, which accounts for about 20 percent 
of sleep time and about 20 minutes of each sleep cycle. Throughout this
stretch of sleep, dreaming occurs, your breathing quickens, your heart rate
increases, your blood pressure rises, your eyes move just as if you were
watching a movie, men develop erections, and your temperature regulation 
is impaired. If you’re awakened during REM sleep, you may find that you’re
hot or cold (mostly hot) and have to adjust the covers accordingly. During
this stage your muscles become temporarily paralyzed, but your brain 
activity increases to levels that are similar to when awake. Babies spend
about 50 percent of their sleep in REM sleep.
Dreams rarely occur in NREM sleep, and most often are a function of REM
sleep. Dreams can be images, sounds, or thoughts and often provoke emotional
responses. Dreams can run scripts related to events that happened during the
day or they can be quite dynamic containing many details, leaving dreamers
wondering what may have caused them to dream specific topics. Researchers
have a couple of theories about the reasons for these dreams:
283
Chapter 14: ZZZ . . . The Infinite Importance of a Good Night's Sleep

 The brain uses dreams as a mechanism for categorizing information
and realigning brain-related pathways. In other words, the brain per-
forms certain housecleaning tasks that it can’t do while a person is up
and moving. Lending credence to this theory is the fact that REM sleep
is most active during the first two years of life when a baby’s brain is
growing and developing.
 Dreams are associated with a person’s emotions. If you’re very worried
about a problem, there’s a strong possibility that you’ll dream about it at
night. That’s not always bad — often, a discovery or a way to solve that
problem also shows up in a dream.
On the flip side, bad dreams or nightmares can be reminders of issues or
fears that need to be addressed. In other words, dreams may act as a pres-
sure-cooker, allowing you to vent your feelings in the safety of your sleep.
How Sleep Changes as You Age
As you age, you may become more prone to wakeful nights both because of
natural age-related sleep cycle changes and other problematic causes. Quality
of sleep can decrease because deep sleep (the delta sleep of stages three 
and four) decreases, and light sleep (stage two) increases (see the preceding 
section). Until recently, research on sleep problems focused on the elderly.
However, new research indicates that sleep disruptions start in middle age —
the time of life when people are most productive. Hormonal changes com-
bined with work- and family-related stressors are a recipe for sleepless nights.
There’s conflicting evidence about the exact causes of age-associated impaired
sleep, but it’s clear that impaired sleep is a common complaint of the elderly.
As you get older, the following issues may contribute to poor sleep patterns:
 Sleep hygiene: Sleep hygiene is the practice of following simple guide-
lines to ensure restful, effective sleep that promotes daytime alertness
and helps avoid the onset of sleep disorders. Poor sleep hygiene is the
number one cause of sleep-related issues in all populations, including the
elderly. Sleep is easily disturbed by outside influences and bad habits of
the poor sleepers. Irregular sleep/wake times, caffeine, alcohol, and day-
time napping are all common occurrences. Sometimes people are already
practicing these bad habits while others grasp onto them for a desperate
solution. (See the later section “Resuming Your Rhythm When You Veer
Off Track” for more on this issue.)
 Changes in the circadian rhythm: Circadian rhythms are the powerful
rhythms of the body that influence many different systems — sleep being
one of them. A few situations — such as illicit drug use, travel across
time zones, and brain diseases — can cause this rhythm to be out of sync
and become a major difficulty (see the next section for a rundown of the
circadian rhythm).
284
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

People tend to sleep more lightly and for shorter time spans as they get
older, although they generally need about the same amount of sleep 
as they needed in early adulthood. About half of all people over 65 have
frequent sleeping problems, such as insomnia, and deep sleep stages in
many elderly people often become very short or stop completely. This
change may be a normal part of aging, or it may result from medical
problems that are common in elderly people and from the medications
and other treatments for those problems.
 Hormone changes: Changes in a woman’s body before and during
menopause can cause severe disruptions to sleep, such as hot flashes,
heart palpitations, and anxiety. Decreases in both growth hormone and
melatonin, two important hormones for sleep regulation, is one of the
biggest causes of sleep problems in the elderly.
 Pain: Pain is a common reason for poor sleep in older people. From
arthritis to heartburn, pain or discomfort is a common complaint as you
age. Even minor aches and pains rob older people of sleep.
 Bladder control problems: Frequency or loss of control of urination
may cause awakenings in both men and women and seem to increase
with age. Men frequently awake to urinate because of enlargement of 
the prostate, while women may lose some strength and control over the
muscles of the bladder that results in the need for more frequent bath-
room trips at night. Some people get to the point where they wear adult
pads just to try to keep the problem from interfering with sleep, but it
can still interfere with the quality of sleep even if you don’t have to get
out of bed. See your doctor for some possibilities to improve these 
conditions and your sleep.
 Sleep disorders: Conditions such as sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome
(RLS), and insomnia are all commonly experienced as you age.
 Prescription medications: Some medications can interfere with sleep.
Some antidepressants, nicotine, and beta-blockers can effect the stages
of sleep and therefore how rested you feel.
Understanding Your Biological 
Clock: The Circadian Rhythm
Your body has a 24-hour internal clock (called the circadian rhythm) that
controls your biological functions. Your personal circadian rhythm governs
the time you wake in the morning and when you feel sleepy at night, as well
as the times you feel most productive — essentially, it’s your biological clock.
(People who are most productive and happily awake in the wee hours of the
night have a circadian rhythm that’s opposite from most people — but it’s
normal for them.)
285
Chapter 14: ZZZ . . . The Infinite Importance of a Good Night's Sleep

The more you understand — and listen to — your personal clock, the more
rested you feel. This section is all about helping you find that rhythm and
keeping you on schedule even when the occasional sleep problems threaten
to throw you off course.
Seeing how the rhythm works 
and how it runs amok
Circadian rhythms work by influencing hormones that play a role in sleep 
and wakefulness, metabolic rate, and body temperature. The circadian rhythm
affects more than just sleep, and researchers feel that it has a connection to
certain diseases and medical events. For instance, researchers have found that
more people have heart attacks in the morning than in the evening and more
asthma attacks happen at night than during the day. Although researchers
haven’t proven the connection between these events and the circadian rhythm,
there’s a lot of interest in the possibility of such a connection.
Most people have a circadian rhythm a lot like their ancestors; however, 
that rhythm is all too often affected by artificial light, night shifts at work,
time zones, medications, and other factors. This rhythm is controlled by the
suprachiasmatic nucleus that lies in the hypothalamus of the brain. Some of
the influences on sleep center on the body clock missing some of its clues,
such as bright morning light or evening darkness. These changes can cause
the rhythm to shift, and as a result, your suprachiasmatic nucleus produces
hormones at the wrong time or stops producing the right amounts altogether
if it’s interrupted for long periods.
Here are some common reasons why circadian rhythms are off- balance:
 Jet lag: This condition of fatigue and insomnia is caused by travel across
time zones. This travel disrupts the circadian rhythm, causing sleepiness
and decreased daytime alertness. It usually resets in three to four days,
but it can take a week to feel back to baseline.
 Rotating work shifts: You may be affected by this issue if you frequently
rotate shifts at work, especially night shifts.
 Night owls: Night owls suffer from delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS).
These folks stay up almost all night, functioning well when most other
people wouldn’t be able to recite the alphabet. That said, however, night
owls have a hard time waking up for work, school, or social engagements.
 Advanced sleep phase syndrome: This issue (ASPS) causes folks to get
sleepy in the very early evening but then wake up before the rooster
crows. This experience is typical of aging.

If you feel that your circadian rhythm is off due to one of the above reasons
see the section below, “Resuming Your Rhythm When You Veer Off Track” to
improve your sleep or correct one of the sleeping syndromes. You can also
check out www.sleepdisordersguide.com or www. clevelandclinic.
org (type “DSPS” or “ASPS” into the search section) for more information on
ASPS and DSPS.
Determining your own circadian rhythm
Just like your thumbprint, your sleep needs are unique. Some people can 
live on five to six hours of sleep each night, and others are positively grumpy
if they don’t get their eight hours of shut-eye. Some folks are night owls and 
a few oddballs (we can’t handle it) wake up refreshed and perky at the crack
of dawn (although the oddballs become increasingly less “odd” among older
populations).
At some point, each person finds his or her own comfortable sleep cycle,
whether it’s forced by work, children, or the desire to maintain a cycle based
on the least amount of sleep required to still feel well. After your circadian
rhythm is established, it’s delicate and resistant to change. You can likely
recall an evening when you went to bed later than you normally do, but slept
in longer to keep the total number of sleep hours the same. The strange thing
is that you don’t feel the same even though your total amount of sleep is 
adequate.
This example shows how the rhythm establishes the release of hormones
that solidify your sleep; even small variations in the pattern can result in 
less- optimal sleep. If you’re having trouble setting your rhythm based on
when you feel you should be sleeping, try moving your bedtime forward or
backward by one to two hours. If you have to work at falling asleep, give this
a try; your circadian rhythm may be an hour or so out of whack.
In general, adults need about eight hours of sleep daily. The amount of sleep
each person needs depends on many factors, including age. Here’s a typical
rundown:
 Infants generally require about 14 to 16 hours a day.
 Teenagers need about eight to nine hours on average.
 For most adults, seven to nine hours a night appears to be the best
amount of sleep, although some people may need as few as five hours 
or as many as ten hours of sleep each day.
 Women in the first three months of pregnancy often need several more
hours of sleep than usual.
287
Chapter 14: ZZZ . . . The Infinite Importance of a Good Night's Sleep

People who feel that they need more than eight hours of sleep often have
complaints of fatigue, are taking more than one medication, or have other
medical complaints. Even when they do get nine or ten hours of sleep, they
seldom feel completely rested.
The amount of sleep a person needs also increases if she’s been deprived of
sleep in previous days. When you don’t get enough sleep, you create a “sleep
debt,” and your body doesn’t have overdraft protection. You end up paying for
it one way or another. Your body isn’t able to adapt to getting less sleep than
you need; while you may think that you’re used to a sleep-depriving schedule,
your judgment, reaction time, and other functions are still impaired. Paying
back sleep debt is impossible. Sleeping for a week can’t reverse the toll of 
continuous sleep deprivation. You simply have to get back into a routine and
get your circadian rhythm back to normal.
If you’re sleep-deprived, no one needs to tell you — you can feel it! Experts
say that if you feel drowsy during the day at any time (boring activities
excluded), you haven’t had enough sleep.
288

Workin’ 9 (p.m.) to 5 (a.m.)
Some people, by virtue of their jobs, don’t have
the luxury of sleeping at night, no matter what
their personal circadian rhythm is. Nurses,
police officers, casino workers, and pilots are
just a few professionals who have to be on the
job when everyone else is getting some ZZZs.
Many people who work odd shifts gravitate to
these times because they have circadian
rhythms that fit being up all night; others work
night shift because their job requires shift rota-
tion, or because all newbies start on the night
shift. If your circadian rhythm is set for the night,
you’re good to go. But what if the night shift 
is anything but natural for you — or, even
worse, if your job requires rotating shifts? Try
the following suggestions:
 Sleep at a regular time. You may be too
wired to go right to sleep, so establish reg-
ular sleep hygiene, like a glass of warm
milk, a warm bath, or listening to relaxing
music for 15 minutes. Don’t watch television
or start reading the latest bestseller.
 Darken your room — really darken it — and
buy one of the gradually lightening lights
that simulates dawn.
 Turn off the phone! When Sharon worked
nights, the ringing of the phone was the pet
peeve of most of her fellow nightshifters.
Why not just turn the thing off? If you have
school-aged kids who may call with an
emergency, try to have a nearby friend who
can be your contact person; she can come
pound on your door if you’re really needed.
 Run a noise machine. The white noise —
such as rainfall or ocean waves — that’s
emitted from sound machines is a gentle
tone that can be found in nature. White
noise combines the frequencies of sound
from low tones to high pitches, making it
useful to mask other noises and sounds.
This is invaluable, especially during the
summer when kids are out playing. Try to
sleep in a back bedroom, away from the
street, to cut down on noise.

An unscientific way of testing how much sleep you need is to go to bed 
and wake up at the same time every day. If you get to the weekend and find
yourself sleeping in, your body’s telling you that it has a sleep debt. If, on the
other hand, you wake up wide-eyed and bushy-tailed on Saturday morning at
approximately the same time as you do during the week, you’re doing just
peachy on getting your required sleep.
If you routinely fall asleep within five minutes of lying down, you may have
severe sleep deprivation, possibly even a sleep disorder. The widespread prac-
tice of “burning the candle at both ends” in Western industrialized societies
has created so much sleep deprivation that what’s really abnormal sleepiness
is now almost the norm.
Recognizing abnormal sleep issues
Many times people with sleeping problems complain of multiple medical
symptoms and problems. For example, they may say that they can’t keep
their eyes open during important meetings at work, or they may complain
that they can’t return to sleep after they awake at night. Truthfully, people
can blame just about anything on lack of sleep, but for some it’s more than
just an excuse.
Good sleep hygiene (see the section “Resuming Your Rhythm When You Veer
Off Track”) can greatly reduce or eliminate some symptoms, such as waking
up tired; however, some symptoms — such as gasping for air (sleep apnea) —
can be serious or deadly; they require immediate medical attention. Others,
like sleepwalking, can be symptoms of a serious sleep disorder or another
medical problem.
Here are some signs that you may have a sleep disorder:
 Being unable to sleep at night or waking up numerous times during 
the night
 Being too tired to perform simple tasks
 Being irritable and unable to concentrate
 Snoring so loudly that you disrupt your sleep or the sleep of your partner
 Sleepwalking or talking in your sleep
 Gasping for air while you sleep
 Twitching in your legs at night
 Sleeping more than nine hours a night for an extended period of time
289
Chapter 14: ZZZ . . . The Infinite Importance of a Good Night's Sleep

A sleep disorder is any condition that prevents you from getting a good night’s
sleep for an extended period of time. If you haven’t slept well for about two
weeks, you may have a sleep problem. So, if you experience any of these
symptoms for at least two weeks and you maintain consistently good sleep
hygiene, consult your primary care physician to discuss your situation and
possible treatments (more on that topic at the end of this chapter in the 
section “Seeking Professional Treatment”).
Resuming Your Rhythm When 
You Veer Off Track
Some of the most common causes of sleeping problems are completely 
preventable and fall under one category: sleep hygiene. Sleep hygiene isn’t
specifically associated with cleanliness — it focuses on the everyday habits
that induce good sleep. Often these routines are the first things investigated
when visiting your doctor with a complaint that you can’t sleep, and often
they require very simple changes.
Some of the most common remedies for poor sleep are listed here. Remember,
though, that these are general guidelines — you may be lucky enough to be
able to drink a double espresso two hours before bedtime and not have it
interfere with your sleep, but even if you can, you may not be sleeping as 
well as you could be!
Here are some bedtime tips:
 Reserve the bed as a sacred place for sleeping (or sex). Don’t watch
television or read when you’re in bed. The bed is a place for sleep; don’t
go there until you’re ready for that commitment. Do your socializing and
television watching in another room because these types of activities
can stimulate your mind enough to affect your sleep. Or you may find
yourself so caught up in reading a book that you can’t put it down and
are still wide awake reading until early in the morning.
 Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. The easiest way to
reset your rhythm when it’s been thrown out of whack by travel, late
nights, or illness is to get back to your targeted sleep/wake cycle and
stick to it. The body functions well on a fixed schedule. Your body can’t
set a consistent schedule, or circadian rhythm, when you go to bed at 
11 p.m. one day and then 2 a.m. the next. You’ll feel tired and often have
difficulty sleeping. After you determine the time you want to go to bed
and the time you want to wake up, you need to go to bed consistently at
that time and set an alarm to get up at your desired time each morning.
 Steer clear of the caffeine at least six hours prior to bed. Some people
are actually affected by caffeine longer than this timeframe, but six
290
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

hours is a good rule of thumb. Remember that chocolate also falls into
this category. Sorry, chocoholics!
 Exercise regularly but at a reasonable time. Yes, this advice is a con-
stant for what ails you. Exercising regularly (at least 30 minutes a day;
preferably in the morning) helps you sleep better at night. Remember 
to stay away from heavy exercise two to three hours before bed — 
the release of endorphins, which are natural stimulants, energizes and
wakes your body up, and it can take a few hours to wind back down.
 Eat your last meal or snack at least three hours before going to bed.
You don’t want to go to bed starving either. The important point to
remember is to avoid eating a large meal or high-sugar content meal
before bed. This intake can cause heartburn and other gastrointestinal
upsets that interrupt sleep.
 Try not to nap during the day. If you don’t sleep well during the night,
logically, you shouldn’t sleep during the day so that you can establish 
a pattern. You may have to work hard at skipping that afternoon snooze 
to get into a good sleep pattern, but you can do it.
 Avoid drinking alcohol four hours before bed. Many people drink 
alcohol because they feel that it makes them sleep better. Yes, it can
make some people fall asleep, but the problem is that it often keeps 
you in the lighter stages of sleep.
 Consult your doctor about sleeping medications. Don’t take any sleep-
ing medication — even over-the-counter ones — without consulting
your doctor. Sometimes medications that make one person sleepy may
make you wide awake, and some pills make getting up in the morning
harder and can make your body dependent on the medication. You also
don’t want to treat sleeping problems if you can solve them — getting in
sync may take a few days, but you’ll feel better in the long run.
If you have recurring, disturbing dreams that are adversely affecting you, talk
to your doctor to see whether he or she can help. Getting a detailed medical
history dating back to when the dreams or nightmares started may help you
see whether any life-changing events, medication changes, or other major
lifestyle changes could be the cause. Your doctor will make recommendations
based how it affects your activities.
Getting Back to Sleep When 
Your Eyes Are Wide Awake
It happens to everyone, and is one of the most frustrating events of sleeping:
You wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. If this is
just an occasional occurrence, don’t worry too much about it. But if it happens
often, you may want to review your evening dietary indiscretions, your 
291
Chapter 14: ZZZ . . . The Infinite Importance of a Good Night's Sleep

bedroom’s soundproofing, or your partner’s snoring patterns to see whether
you can figure out what’s waking you up.
Hopefully the information in this chapter will cut those frustrating wide-eyed
nights to a minimum, but if you still find yourself staring at the ceiling at 3 a.m.,
the following suggestions may help:
 Write down your anxious thoughts. Many people find it helpful to keep
a journal to unload in. You can also write a letter to a person who’s
upsetting you, but you don’t have to send it.
 Remember that you can’t fix things in the middle of the night. Remind
yourself that there’s nothing you can do about a problem in the wee hours
of the night; then convince yourself to set it aside until you’re refreshed
and have the ability to change the situation. Often, this self-talk is enough
to help you break the worry cycle. In the morning, you may wonder
what on earth you were so worried about — the nighttime has a way 
of magnifying problems until they seem insurmountable.
 Get up. If you find that you really can’t go back to sleep, get out of bed
and do something really boring. That means absolutely no Web surfing
or television. If you just have to read, make sure it’s nothing motivating
or incredibly engaging — try the section of your local newspaper that
least interests you. You don’t want to stimulate your brain.
You can also listen to a relaxation CD or take a warm bath. Also, keep the
lights down as much as possible. Light is a stimulant — the last thing you
need when you’re having a restless night.
 Shut off the TV. Reading or watching TV can produce different stimula-
tory emotions such as anxiety, anger, and sadness. Any of these can get
the mind going and the body stimulated. Practice relaxation techniques
that focus on the tension of the relaxation of the muscles after a brief
contraction. This starts at the toes and goes up the whole body.
 Drink some warm milk. Milk contains some of the amino acids (particu-
larly L-tryptophan, a precursor to the sleep hormone melatonin that your
body creates) that help you sleep. A half-cup of warm milk is often all you
need to relax.
 Drink chamomile tea. Chamomile is a great tea because of its mild sedat-
ing effect. Much like warm milk, this beverage can be a great solution for
a restless night.
 Take a warm bath. A warm bath just before bedtime is a signal to the
body that it’s time to relax. Adding lavender oil to your bath water or
rubbing some lavender oil on your body after you bathe will help you
sleep, too. Research suggests that some scents like lavender and
chamomile trigger a sleep response.
292
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

 Turn off the lights. Research suggests that even the smallest bit of light
coming from your clock radio, for example, can disrupt the secretion of
the sleep-time hormone melatonin. Keep lights off as much as possible
during the night. If you have to use the bathroom, use a night light. Make
sure that your bedroom shades are drawn tight, so that light from out-
side sources doesn’t enter your room. If you really want to induce deep
sleep, put on an eye mask to keep out all light.
 Try tension relaxation or meditation. Start at your feet and work up to
the muscles of your head, tensing and relaxing the muscles while focusing
on relaxation. This technique can move you into a better position for
sleep. Meditating is another positive option.
 Breathe. Shallow breathing is a sign of stress. If you’re tense, inhale
deeply to the count of four. Then slowly exhale while counting to four.
The more oxygen you get, the more relaxed you become. Do this breath-
ing routine 10 to 12 times; many people fall asleep in the middle of it!
Seeking Professional Treatment
We aren’t trying to take job security from doctors, but most sleeping issues
don’t require professional help. Sleep issues account for many medical visits
each year, and most people are looking for a simple “pill fix.” But most people
need just the information in this chapter to put them to sleep. If you still
struggle to sleep after trying our suggestions, professional help is an option.
Just remember that good doctors are going to explore your sleeping habits
rather than just pulling out the prescription pad. If you’ve tried everything
and sleep is still elusive, the following professional approaches may help.
Handling occasional sleeping problems
Many treatments can help you get better sleep. Some studies suggest medita-
tion and cognitive therapy are effective and long-lasting treatments, and they
don’t require medication. However, physician-prescribed medication is neces-
sary and a welcome relief for those people who’ve been sleep-deprived for
years. The following list covers the wide range of sleep-related treatments:
 Cognitive therapy: Cognitive therapy addresses your thought processes
and can be used for many other conditions, such as anxiety. For example,
if you think, “Oh, no, if I don’t get to sleep tonight, I’ll never sleep well,”
you’re setting yourself up for a sleepless night; you’re conditioning your
mind to believe that sleep is an anxiety-ridden activity. Cognitive therapy
is about changing your belief system and allowing you to make more 
reasonable decisions about how much sleep you really need.
293
Chapter 14: ZZZ . . . The Infinite Importance of a Good Night's Sleep

 Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR): This therapy uses imagery and
self-hypnosis to relax the muscles in your body. With PMR, you contract
and relax different muscle groups from your head to your toes. As you
do the exercises, you’re able to address tension in your body that keeps
you from sleeping.
 Meditation: Guided meditations on CD take you on a journey of relaxation
and self-hypnosis that can help you sleep better.
 Supplements: Herbs like chamomile, lemon balm, and valerian root have
been used for centuries to induce sleep. However, no serious studies
have indicated how effective these herbs really are. Note: If you’re on
medication for conditions like diabetes, arthritis, or heart disease, talk
to your doctor before trying natural supplements. Some supplements
may interfere with effectiveness of pharmaceutical drugs.
 Pharmaceutical sleep aids: If you’re having a lot of difficulty sleeping,
your doctor may prescribe a drug like zolpidem (Ambien), ramelteon
(Rozerem), or eszopiclone (Lunesta). These drugs may stabilize your
sleep rhythms so that your body can rest. After you get into a sleep 
routine, you’re weaned off the medication.
Identifying and correcting sleep disorders
You can find several ways to treat sleep problems, and hopefully you see 
the difference between treating and resolving. Medications for insomnia and
equipment for sleep apnea can treat problems, but proper sleep hygiene and
weight loss can resolve them. If you do have a sleep disorder, shoot to find a
resolution, not just a temporary solution when working on the treatment plan.
Medical conditions can have people flocking into their doctor’s office begging
for sleep remedies. Medical conditions may respond to simple treatments
and solutions, but they may also require more serious medical intervention.
The following sections include some of the most common sleep disorders 
for adults.
Insomnia
Insomnia is a general word to describe the inability to fall asleep. When you
have insomnia, you may feel tired but you just can’t sleep. Some people waken
several times during the night or wake up and can’t fall asleep again until the
early morning. Acute or transient insomnia lasts from one night to a couple of
weeks, but insomnia must occur on most nights for more than a month to be
considered chronic.
294
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

Having a couple of sleepless nights when you’re under stress is normal, but 
if sleepless nights become habitual — and you’ve already been through the
sleep hygiene guidelines — talk to a doctor. When sleeplessness becomes a
consistent problem, you begin to experience daytime drowsiness that affects
your work and other daily activities. Over time, insomnia can
 Lead to poor performance on the job
 Affect your personal relationships
 Leave you vulnerable to illness and disease
 Make you more accident-prone
Some effective treatments for insomnia include relaxation, cognitive behavioral
therapy, and stress reduction. You may also need to take prescription and 
over-the-counter sleep aids. Note: With some prescriptions you run the risk of
dependence, so talk to your doctor about your options.
Sleep apnea
The word apnea means “without breath” and is exactly what occurs when
people are afflicted with sleep apnea. People who suffer from sleep apnea
actually have episodes where they stop breathing during their sleep. These
episodes can last for a few seconds to several seconds and can occur more
than 100 times a night. People who have sleep apnea wake up feeling tired and
irritable and may experience a sore throat or dry mouth when they wake up.
Some people with sleep apnea wake up gasping for air while others are
aroused enough to breathe and then return to sleep without a clue to their
problems. Oftentimes, if they don’t remember these episodes, their sleep
partners do — it’s frightening to see and hear!
Sleep apnea is dangerous and has been implicated in conditions such as cog-
nitive impairment, behavior problems, heart disease, and even sudden death.
It’s unclear whether the apnea itself or ongoing apnea and its associated
heart disease is what leads to sudden death.
The two kinds of sleep apnea are obstructive and central.
 Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common type, accounting for
about 90 percent of sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when
the muscles in the back of your throat relax and then collapse.
 Central sleep apnea occurs when your brain doesn’t send the proper
signals to the muscles that control breathing.
295
Chapter 14: ZZZ . . . The Infinite Importance of a Good Night's Sleep

The risks of getting sleep apnea include excess weight, having a thick neck,
being male, aging, smoking, and the use of sleep medications. To determine
whether you suffer from sleep apnea, your doctor may request that you do
some sleep testing.
Some treatments for sleep apnea include oral devices that open the blocked
airways or the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAPP) — a device that
blows air into your nose at night. Surgery may be recommended for serious
cases; for less serious cases, losing weight is often enough to put an end to
sleep apnea.
Restless leg syndrome
People with restless leg syndrome (RLS) feel like they constantly have to
move their legs to find a more comfortable position. However, no position
feels right for long. Their legs feel tight and tingly, as if bugs were crawling 
up their calves. RLS negatively affects your sleep and may keep your partner
from sleeping, too.
RLS seems to be more prevalent in women. Conditions like pregnancy,
anemia (low iron), and depression may be the underlying causes. Other more
serious conditions like Parkinson’s, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis may
also cause RLS.
Behavioral changes that may minimize the problem include taking warm baths
before bedtime, doing yoga stretches, and walking slowly. If the problem is
anemia, an iron supplement may eliminate the problem entirely. The bottom
line is that RLS is a very treatable condition, so see your doctor.

Don’t Worry, Be Happy: The Keys
to Maintaining Health and Vitality
In This Chapter
 Realizing the power of positive thinking
 Balancing your life with healthy approaches
 Staying connected with family and friends
 Knowing the benefits of having a spiritual life
 Enjoying sex for years to come
T
he power of positive thinking is more than just a cliché; it’s supported 
by medical facts. Positive people live longer, healthier, happier lives than
negative people. People who go with the flow and handle change with grace
resolve conflicts and overcome health challenges better than those who
resist change. Your outlook and attitude are the octane boosters that power
you through each day giving your body the extra edge it needs to survive.
Pessimistic people harvest stress, focus on failures, and are reluctant to keep
moving forward. This approach to life affects relationships, work, and your
health in the same negative way. Staying positive and keeping faith helps
maintain a balance between the body and the mind. People who are emotion-
ally and spiritually connected to a higher power have a stronger will to live,
thereby increasing their longevity.
In this chapter, we examine the importance of maintaining a positive attitude
as you age and examine its role in keeping you healthy, happy, and serene no
matter what your age or circumstances.

The Importance of a Positive Attitude
Aging brings major life changes, and staying positive and happy isn’t always
easy during the years when you may lose people near and dear to you, have
unexpected health issues, need to move out of the family home for financial
or health reasons, have children move away, or retire from a job that meant
the world to you.
Yet, contrary to popular opinion, aging and a negative attitude don’t go hand
in hand. One large study reported in the Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology that as people age, they become happier rather than sadder and
are able to regulate emotions more effectively than younger or middle aged
adults. Even if you’re not Mary Sunshine by nature, you can learn to develop
a positive overall outlook.
Why bother? Although being optimistic isn’t a surefire ticket to living into
your 100s, several studies have shown that pessimism can increase your risk
of dying at a younger age. Consider the following studies:
 A study done in the Netherlands involving nearly 1,000 participants age 
65 to 85 showed that people who described themselves as being highly
optimistic had a risk of dying that was 55 percent lower than the risk of
pessimists during the ten-year study period. The risks of dying from heart
disease were 23 percent lower for optimists during the same period.
 The Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement began in the 1970s
with over 1,100 people and concluded more than 20 years later with over
600 people over age 50. The study showed that people with a healthy 
attitude toward aging lived more than seven years longer than those with
a negative attitude.
 The Mayo Clinic reported that when psychological tests given to over
800 people were reviewed, pessimistic people were 19 percent more
likely to have died in any given year than optimists.
Like everything else, you can carry optimism too far, which can have grave
consequences. When you carry it too far, it ends up being more harmful than
beneficial. Optimism can lead to a carefree attitude that results in unfortu-
nate, but often avoidable problems resulting from taking risks when taking
precautions would be the proper action. Excessive optimism can also lead 
to an overly trusting attitude, and some overly trusting seniors have been
conned out of large sums of money by individuals or organizations. Again,
balance is the key, and you have to have the right amount of positive thinking
and common sense when it comes to your health, money, and other impor-
tant life issues.
The bottom line? Being optimistic can help you live longer — but don’t leave
common sense at the door. In some situations, skepticism or a touch of 
pessimism may be the right choice.

Embracing a Healthy, Balanced
Approach to Life
If you feel at times that life is a balancing act, you’re in good company. Most
people spend time trying to keep their lives in balance, because keeping life
in balance, or a state of equilibrium, can lead to a happier, less stressful life.
Everyone’s life brings unfortunate obstacles and difficult challenges, but life
also brings rewards, opportunity, and satisfaction. When your scale starts to
become imbalanced due to negative life events, the challenge is figuring out
how to regain your balance so that you don’t fall into patterns of negativity 
and pessimism, which increase stress and make bad situations worse. Finding
balance may be very difficult at times, but looking for ways to maintain balance
can keep you from getting overwhelmed and will lead to a healthier life even
when you’re under stress.
Turning around negativity
You may be convinced that a positive attitude can benefit your life, but how
do you become a positive person if it doesn’t come naturally? It’s not as hard
you think — being aware of your negativity is half the battle; figuring out how
to turn negativity around is the other half.
Although a little negativity is normal in life, constant negativity can make you
stressed, anxious, depressed, or bitter. It can wear away your self esteem and
perpetuate a pattern of self-destructive behaviors. Some negative thoughts
that can have negative effects on a positive attitude include
 Worrying about what other people think about you: Studies show that
most of the time, other people aren’t thinking about you at all, except to
wonder what you think of them.
 Preoccupation or obsession with stressors: Although thinking through
problems can be beneficial, constantly brooding about stressors pro-
duces only one thing — more stress! (See Chapter 13 for a load of specific
stress-reducing strategies.)
 Dwelling on the past and things you can’t change: You can learn lessons
from the past, but constantly thinking about “what might’ve been” is
unhealthy and unproductive.
 Self criticism: Self improvement is fine; putting yourself down isn’t. After
all, the world has enough people who feel the need to criticize, so why
would you do that to yourself? You’re your own best cheerleader, and you
deserve the same respect and compassion from yourself that you give 
to others.
299
Chapter 15: Don’t Worry, Be Happy: The Keys to Maintaining Health and Vitality

Turning yourself from a negative to a positive person takes conscious effort
and a lot of practice. Take these tips to heart:
 Figure out how to recognize negative thoughts. Stop entertaining them
as soon as you notice them.
 Replace the negative thoughts with positive ones by turning concerns
“on their head.” Instead of thinking that you’ll never be as productive 
at work as your friend, try to determine what it is that makes your friend
productive. Positive attitude, the ability to say no when necessary, the
ability to delegate? Which of those things can you modify in yourself to
make yourself into a more productive person?
 Put the negative thought into perspective. If you find yourself using
terms like “always” and “never” to describe situations — as in, “I’ll never
be promoted” or “She always gets the best assignments” — you may need
to adjust your perspective on life. Very few things are black and white,
and honestly examining your feelings, or writing them down, may help
you see where you’ve fallen into negative thought patterns. Feelings are
just that — feelings. They’re not facts, and very often your feelings don’t
match the facts in a given situation. If you can find the discrepancies, you
can begin to adjust your thinking.
Bringing out a mental “stop” sign whenever you find yourself drifting into
negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ideas may be awkward at
first, but within a few weeks, you may find that negativity is no longer a habit.
And like many bad habits, negativity comes with health risks for aging that
you can modify for a longer, more enjoyable life.
Being less confrontational
As you get older, you may feel like you spend half your life fighting with
people — your younger boss, your kids, your spouse, the girl at the super-
market, your best friend. On one hand, you don’t want your middle name 
to be “doormat,” but on the other hand, being in constant conflict with other
people is exhausting, it upsets your stomach, and it demolishes your hard-
earned optimistic view of life. Some people — hopefully you’re not one of
them — feel that everything in life is worth fighting about, and so they spend
most of their life in emotional turmoil. Learn to choose your battles — some
things really aren’t worth fighting about. Ask yourself, “Will this matter in 
a month?” If the answer is “no,” why get yourself tied up in knots over it?
Conflict is, however, a part of life, one that some people never figure out 
how to handle well. Handling conflict means taking the high road sometimes
and searching for the win-win solution in every situation. This resolution isn’t 
the same as giving in. If everybody wins, everybody’s happy, including you.
Facing conflict and traveling the paths to overcoming it builds character and
confidence.
300
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

Defuse conflict by using some of these techniques:
 Know what you believe and stick to it. Have a core set of values — a
balanced mix of self-awareness and confidence — while still being open-
minded and accepting of other viewpoints. These values allow you to
take a stand when moral or ethical issues arise and feel confident every
time. Having a firm foundation of beliefs also lets you come across to
others as committed, not defensive and antagonistic.
 Look for common ground. Keep focused on a positive, solution-based
outcome. You may only agree to disagree, but you can do it without
killing each other.
 Realize that other people are human too. Other people may often 
not live up to your expectation of them, so don’t be surprised, disap-
pointed, or upset to the point of argument when this happens. Being
human, however, is a two-way street; you may not always live up to
others’ expectations — or your own! Cut yourself the same break that
you’d give someone else when you’re not living up to your expectations.
And, if you’re not living up to someone else’s expectations, look at 
yourself with a clear eye instead of assuming that you’re in the right
every time.
 Think carefully before setting yourself up for confrontational situations.
Do certain topics push your hot buttons with certain people? Then don’t
talk about them with that person, unless you’re in the mood for a good
argument. Does driving 12 hours in the car with your spouse turn you into
someone who would argue that the sky isn’t blue? Make alternate plans.
(Maybe one of you could fly and the other could drive, or you could stop
halfway and stay overnight.)
 Figure out why this is upsetting you. Every argument has a root cause,
and often the thing you’re actually arguing about isn’t really the source
of aggravation at all. Ask yourself “What’s really causing this conflict,
and why am I reacting the way I am?”
 Always think win-win. There’s almost always a way for both parties to
feel they’ve won. Put away your swords and look for a way for each side
to walk away with a benefit. Resolving a conflict can be a great lesson in
seeing an issue from another person’s perspective, whether you agree
with it or not. After you arrive at a win-win solution, accept it and imple-
ment it. Make sure that each person takes responsibility for agreeing
with the decision.
 Check your emotions at the door. Conflict resolution is about problem
solving, which is a logical process. Emotions color your perceptions and
your logic and cloud the rational thinking that’s essential to arriving at 
a solution.
 Put your heads together. Two heads are better than one, and three may
be better yet. The more people focused on the solution, the better the
odds of a successful outcome.

Staying Active and In 
Touch with the World
Staying active as you age means far more than riding your bicycle around 
the block every evening. Staying active and in touch involves both physically
being involved in activities in your community and mentally being involved
with the world around you. Being connected to your world is good for your
health and mental attitude, and it can also benefit those around you.
Not sure where to start? Here are some suggestions.
 Know what’s going on in the world. Read the newspaper. Watch the
evening news. Subscribe to a weekly news magazine or read one at your
local library. Being in touch with what’s going on decreases feelings of
isolation and gives you something more interesting to talk about with
others than the state of your bowels.
 Get a job. Many seniors work part time not only to earn a little extra
spending money but also to stay active. Love antiques? How about a part-
time job in an antique store? Love books? Would working at a bookstore
or the library interest you? Love to do woodwork? How about hitting the
weekend craft shows and hawking your wares? Job opportunities are 
limited only by your imagination and, contrary to what you may think,
many businesses love to hire seniors because of their positive work ethic
and their maturity.
 Help others out. Volunteer opportunities are unlimited and many organi-
zations are desperate for help. Hospitals are always in need of volunteers,
and so are groups that help new citizens learn English. Many libraries
have volunteer programs, and Meals on Wheels is always in need of 
drivers.
Want something more exotic? How about a mission trip (not all are reli-
giously based) to a foreign country? You’re never too old to hold babies
or talk to teens in an orphanage. Many organizations offer yearly mission
trips to the same area so that volunteers can make lasting connections
there. Check out www.mmex.org or www.missionfinder.org for any
number of organizations looking for volunteers for a week, a month, or 
a year, all over the world.
 Get out and travel. Going to a new place not only gives you something
to talk about, but also sharpens your mind, stretches your map-reading
skills, and is fun. Go on your own or with an organized group; you have
no excuse for staying home when an organized tour does all the legwork
for you.
302
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

 Find a new hobby or expand an old one. Do you love to sing? How about
joining the local theater group (roles exist for all ages) or a barbershop
quartet, or just singing in the church choir? Build model airplanes and join
a local flying group. Crochet blankets or quilt. Join a book club — or start
one in your neighborhood. There may be a dozen people on your street
just looking for something new to do — ask around and you may find two
or three folks with interests similar to yours.
 Be civic minded: Volunteer to man voting booths. Stomp for your
favorite candidate — or become a candidate yourself! Neighborhood
associations are often crying for help. Don’t stay away because you
don’t know anyone — most times you’ll be greeted with open arms if
you offer help.
 Use your computer: The age group that’s 55 and older has had the 
highest increase in computer usage. Yes, a lot of trash is on the Internet,
but you can also find interesting chat rooms and instruction of all kinds;
you can even take college courses online. There’s more to the computer
than playing solitaire, so check out the home and garden forums, the
classic car boards, or the health chat rooms and talk to interesting
people without ever leaving home.
 Exercise: You need to stay in shape to accomplish any of the other sug-
gestions in this list. You can do many activities with friends while getting
some exercise. Grab your golf clubs and walk nine holes of golf. It’s a great
way to socialize and exercise at the same time. Get a foursome and play
tennis. If you want some alone time, head to the gym and get some quality
personal time. The people over age 55 who exercise regularly are on a
fraction of the medications that sedentary patients require. With the cost
of medications today, using exercise to reduce some of your medication
load is a great incentive.
Connecting with Your Spiritual Side
Some type of spiritual belief system is found in virtually every society on
earth. People want and need to believe in something greater than themselves.
Some studies have shown that spiritual beliefs and religiosity (participation
in an organized religion) increase with age, leading to considerable research
into the effects of religion and spirituality on health issues and aging since
the 1990s.
You may concede that being spiritual or religious makes people feel healthier,
but are there measurable results to support their belief? Yes, there are. Here
are just a few:
303
Chapter 15: Don’t Worry, Be Happy: The Keys to Maintaining Health and Vitality

 A 1992 study reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry stated that
religious faith increased the ability of older adults to cope with illness,
loss, disability, and mortality issues.
 A study reported in the Southern Medical Journal in 1998 reported that
subjects who attended church once a week were 43 percent less likely to
have been admitted to the hospital for any reason, and those who were
hospitalized had markedly shorter stays.
 An article in The Journal of Pain reported that daily spiritual experiences
were associated with more positive attitudes and resulted in a decrease
in reported pain.
 A Duke University Medical Center in Durham study of over 4,000 partici-
pants over the age of 65 found that those who pray and attend religious
services on a weekly basis, especially those between the ages of 65 
and 74, had lower blood pressure than their counterparts.
So if this is all true, why aren’t doctors out there prescribing religion and
spirituality to their patients? Prescribing “religion” as treatment may cross
ethical lines and also trivialize faith (“Want to get healed? Take this pill, go 
to church this weekend, and call me in the morning.”).
Connecting with Others: The 
Significance of Support
Barbra Streisand sang it best, “People who need people are the luckiest people
in the world.” According to a social survey, the importance of family relation-
ships and good health are the two highest-rated variables when measuring
happiness. Why? The ability to form deep, lasting bonds with other people 
in which you can share life experiences, learn, grow, trust, and support one
another fulfills a fundamental human need. The absence of such relationships
and bonds leads to isolation and depression.
How do the relationships with the people in your life affect your attitude
about getting older and how you spend your days? In this section, we look 
at how staying in touch with your nearest and dearest can be a blessing, 
positively contributing to both your mental and physical well-being.
Family and friends: Life preservers 
of the human kind
As you age, your family and friends may be your most critical lifeline.
Numerous studies have shown that having a strong social network results 
in a longer, healthier, and happier life.
304
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

How can you stay in touch with family or friends who live scattered around
the country or make new friends at a time when getting around can be diffi-
cult? Although keeping in touch with friends and family far away or making
new friends may be difficult, the long-term results are worth it.
Keeping in touch with those nearby
When you live around the corner from family and friends, you may need to
walk a fine line between being in touch and being in touch too much. Gauging
the proper balance between closeness and too much togetherness isn’t always
easy, but, by using common sense, you can maintain close relationships 
without overstepping boundaries.
If you have close family and/or friends nearby, it may be beneficial for both 
of you to have definite times to get together instead of just dropping in and
being dropped in on. Making “dates” to get together once a week, once a
month, or once a day — whatever suits your particular lifestyle — gives both
of you the freedom to plan your day and to know that you’ll be seeing each
other regularly.
Keeping in touch when miles separate you
Staying connected to loved ones who are hundreds of miles away has never
been easier. With the advent of cellphones that transmit pictures instantly to
text messaging to e-mails to phone hookups that allow you to see the person
you’re talking to, you need never be far out of touch with the ones you love.
And if you need to see people in person to feel connected, airlines offer
dozens of flights a day to wherever you want to go. Airfares vary consider-
ably, so get familiar with Web sites like www.travelocity.com or
www.expedia.com, just to name two of many that offer discounted flights,
hotels, and car rentals.
Although all the modern methods of connection are wonderful, don’t forget
one of the old fashioned — and certainly more permanent — ways of staying
in touch — letter writing. Although it’s becoming a forgotten art, letter writ-
ing not only is a way to stay in touch but also leaves a permanent legacy of
your thoughts and day-to-day life behind.
Being a grandparent
If your children have children, being a grandparent can be really fun.
Grandchildren bring all the joy of children with none (or at least less) of the
hassles! Being a grandparent (and a good one at that) takes practice but
brings rewards almost greater than any other relationship as you age. If you
don’t have any grandchildren, you can always volunteer at school functions 
or get involved with organizations such as Big Brothers Big Sisters to develop
meaningful relationships. Some hospitals also have an “Adopted Grandparent”
program for hospitalized children.
305
Chapter 15: Don’t Worry, Be Happy: The Keys to Maintaining Health and Vitality

What makes a wonderful grandparent?
 Love your grandchildren unconditionally. This one comes naturally to
most grandparents!
 Respect their parents. This is often a tough one; respecting their par-
ents means following their rules for child rearing, supporting them in
their decisions, and not sneaking forbidden goodies to your grandchild
behind their parents’ backs.
 Know your boundaries. Holding back on visiting or being involved with
grandchildren’s lives can be hard, but their parent’s wishes must be para-
mount. Visit as often as you’re invited — not as often as you want — and
your relationship will be much happier.
Making new friends
It can be harder, and a little scary, to forge new relationships as you get older.
When you’re younger, work relationships and parenting relationships lead
naturally to friendships, but when you’re older, meeting new people can be
more difficult.
Finding new friends, however, can be fun. Here are some tips:
 Take classes at the YMCA.
 Join a gym.
 Find an organized sports league, such as bowling or softball.
 Join church or town social groups.
Adjusting when friends and family become caregivers
There’s a very good chance that you may need the help of family and/or
friends for daily care as you age. Statistics show that one in four families pro-
vide care for older family or friends. In fact, 85 percent of all long-term care is
provided by unpaid caregivers.
As hard it can be to be a caregiver, it can be just as hard to be the person
taken care of. Being dependent on others can lead to depression, anger with
the person providing your care, and frustration at losing your independence.
Even if you need help with daily care, you can maintain some independence.
For example, you can
 Make some of your own decisions. What do you want to eat? Wear?
Where would you like to sit? What time would you like to go to bed?
There’s no reason to give up all your decision making, unless your
choices are inconvenient for the person doing your care. Making deci-
sions helps keep you sharp and gives you some feeling of control over
your life.
306
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

 Keep in touch with the world. Needing care doesn’t mean you can’t stay
in touch with your world. Read the newspaper or check out the nightly
news. Knowing what’s happening in the world not only helps you feel
connected but also gives you something to talk about at the dinner table.
 Do as much as possible for yourself. The trouble with needing help is
that it’s easy to escalate. Yes, it’s much easier to have someone else do
your hair or pick out your clothes, but allowing others to “take over”
leads to becoming passive and disinterested in your world. Using your
hands and fingers less results in stiffness and loss of agility, so don’t give
up physical tasks just because others can do them faster or neater.
Love relationships: With or without 
them, how you age
You may have had the same partner for the last 40 years, or you may have a
new love interest. You may be newly single, or still single after all these years
and very happy. You can’t argue with happiness, but some research suggests
that having a partner may have its benefits.
According to a study done by the Center for Disease Control, which surveyed
over 127,000 adults, married adults are healthier, smoke and drink alcohol
less, are physically more active, and are less likely to be limited in activities
of daily living. Many studies have come to similar conclusions, including the
following:
 Married people are less likely to suffer from long-term illnesses and
much less likely to die in hospitals as surgical patients.
 Married women at age 48 have an 8 percent risk of dying before age 65,
versus a divorced woman’s risk of 18 percent. A married man at age 48
has a 12 percent risk of dying before age 65, versus a divorced man’s risk
of 35 percent.
 Married people may be healthier because they have increased social
support from their spouse, improving psychological well-being and
immune function.
On the other hand, staying single doesn’t mean that a person has to be alone
or unhappy, nor does it mean that a person’s health has to suffer as a result.
Singlehood may be a choice, and a very happy one at that.
Is being single less beneficial from a health and happiness perspective?
Consider these points:
 Marriage seems to benefit men from a health and emotional perspective
more than women, possibly because single men engage in more risky
behaviors, such as smoking and drinking too much.
307
Chapter 15: Don’t Worry, Be Happy: The Keys to Maintaining Health and Vitality

 People who’ve always been single fare just as well as people who’ve
been married, and both do better than those who’ve been divorced 
or widowed.
 Differences between married and single people are decreasing over time.
This in part is due to the fact that some choose not to get married, but
rather to be committed to someone. With the divorce rate increasing,
many of the stats on health are changing due to the health effects of
divorce.
 The degree to which marriage matters differs across cultures.
S-E-X: Why Getting It On 
May Help You Live Long
Getting older isn’t all bad news. In fact, when it comes to having sex, you can
be ageless, because sexual satisfaction is still possible at any age. Although
age-related changes may necessitate some adjustments, where there’s a will
there’s a way. For both men and women, physiological changes to the body
make having sex a different experience as you age, but different doesn’t mean
worse; it just means adapting. After you understand what to expect sexually
as you age, you’ll see that sexual pleasure and intimacy don’t have to fade
along with the color of your hair.
Sexual activity is good for . . . everything
Sex certainly does have benefits. Regular and enthusiastic sex offers a host 
of measurable physiological advantages, probably more than anyone even
knows. Sexual activity has positive effects on hormones, immune function,
endorphins, and muscle strengthening; even if the effect is just a big smile on
your face, sex does the body good.
Take a look at these examples of what sex can do for the body:
 You live longer. Men who reported the highest frequency of orgasm live
longer than men who had less-frequent orgasms.
 You have a reduced risk of heart disease. Research shows that men
who had sex three or more times a week reduced their risk of heart
attack or stroke by half.
 You can get some exercise. A regular bout of sex burns around 50 
calories — about the same as walking 15 minutes on a treadmill. The
pulse rate in a person who’s aroused rises from about 70 beats per
308
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

minute to 150. However, don’t substitute sex for other forms of exercise.
You would have to engage in sexual activity for many hours to achieve
the same aerobic benefits as other options.
 You experience a sense of well-being. Levels of the hormone oxytocin
increase during intercourse and in turn releases endorphins, which can
give a sense of well-being and can even reduce pain because of the
action of the endorphins and the pain receptors.
 You get sick less. People who have sex weekly have higher levels of an
antibody called immunoglobulin A, which can be important for the
immune system when fighting infections.
Recognizing the effects of aging on sex
Aging itself isn’t responsible for diminished sexual desire. People still feel the
need for sex, and as long as a partner is available, regular sexual activity is as
normal as it is during any other time during your life. Just because people get
older doesn’t mean that they don’t believe that sex still contributes to their
physical and psychological health and well-being.
In most instances when people refrain from sex, it’s not because of lack of
desire, but is rather a functional problem that’s wrongly assumed to be uncor-
rectable. Many men feel that it’s just an inevitable matter of time before they’ll
have to jump in line to get their erectile medication while women assume that
once menopause hits they’ll need a firecracker under their derriere to get
them interested in sex.
Studies show that the physical capacity for male erection and male and female
orgasm continue almost indefinitely, even if achieving orgasm is desired but
not always achieved. Research reveals that people over the age of 55 still
engage in the same varied sexual practices they did when they were younger,
such as masturbation and oral sex, in addition to intercourse. However, age
does bring physical changes that need to be taken into account and adapted
to if you want your sex life to remain lively as you get older.
Age-associated changes in men
Biological and physiological changes in men can impact their sexual function.
These changes include the following:
 A decline in levels of the hormone testosterone: Testosterone is the
male sex hormone responsible for creating and releasing sperm, initiat-
ing sex drive, and providing muscular strength. Between the ages of 
15 and 18, testosterone levels peak. By the time men reach their mid- 
to late-20s, hormone levels start a slow decline. By the age of 40, some
men notice a significant drop. At age 50, half of all men experience a 
309
Chapter 15: Don’t Worry, Be Happy: The Keys to Maintaining Health and Vitality

significant reduction in testosterone levels, resulting in sexual side
effects. For the majority of men with low testosterone levels, the major
complaint is a diminished sex drive. Eighty percent of men who complain
of a low libido also report the inability to maintain a strong erection.
 The duration of the refractory period: The refractory period is the
length of time between ejaculations. As men age, this period of time
increases. The refractory period varies widely between individuals over
a lifetime, ranging from minutes to hours to days. When a man is in his
youth, he may be able to ejaculate multiple times within the period of a
few hours. As a man ages, he may not be able to sustain an erection, let
alone ejaculate, for as many as 24 hours after his previous orgasm.
There are several reasons for this. An increased infusion of the hormone
oxytocin during ejaculation is believed to be chiefly responsible for the
refractory period and the amount that oxytocin is increased may affect
the length of each refractory period. Another reason may be a decrease
in the amount of blood flow to the penis, because circulation can
decrease as you age. Another chemical that could be responsible for the
increase in the refractory period is prolactin. Prolactin suppresses
dopamine, which is responsible for sexual arousal.
 Erectile dysfunction: One of the greatest fears for men as they age is
erectile dysfunction. Fortunately for many, changes in lifestyle choices
can eradicate the problem. Nearly half of men between the ages of 45
and 65 may have erectile dysfunction. The most common factor for
these men is hormone deficiencies, poor dietary habits, lack of exercise,
weight problems, uncontrolled or untreated high blood pressure, and
diabetes.
If you experience erectile dysfunction, talk with your doctor. Erectile
dysfunction may provide a warning sign of coronary heart disease or
diabetes. Erectile dysfunction doesn’t cause heart disease, but it may
indicate that the process of arterial blockage could be a problem in
other areas.
Being aware of the sexual changes your body can go through as you age can
help you be better prepared. Here are some additional age-associated
changes men may experience and should address with their doctor:
 Decrease in the number and frequency of morning erections
 Reduced sexual arousal, both mentally (visual, psychological) and physi-
cally with respect to erectile and orgasm potential
 Reduced duration and strength of orgasm
If you experience a loss of sexual desire and other related sexual side effects,
speak with your healthcare provider. Treatment options may be available.
310
Part V: Sharpening the All-Important Mind and Spirit 

Age-associated changes in women
Menopause (the termination of menstrual periods) is the most dramatic
change that affects women sexually as they age. Menopause usually occurs
between 42 and 56 years of age with the average age being 50. During
menopause hormonal production diminishes, the lining of the vaginal 
wall begins to thin and becomes more rigid, and the production of vaginal
lubrication drops. The lack of vaginal lubrication can make intercourse
uncomfortable and is a big reason that women lose interest in sex. However,
many over-the-counter products aid in lubrication and some prescription
options help, too.
A woman’s capacity to achieve orgasm can remain at near peak levels well
into her senior years, even though it may take quite a bit longer to achieve.
Menopause doesn’t negatively impact a woman’s desire or interest for sex.
Solving sexual problems together
Both partners in a sexual relationship can experience sexual issues. The key
to maintaining a positive relationship is to work together on issues that arise.
The following may help keep things hot as you get older:
 Lubrication: To help with vaginal dryness, decreased erection, or atro-
phied vaginal tissues, use a little lube, such as KY jelly. A little goes a long
way to solve these problems.
 Patience: It’s probably going to take a little longer to get things going —
for both of you. Take the time to enjoy what you’re doing — enjoy 
longer foreplay. Sex isn’t a race, anyway!
311
Chapter 15: Don’t Worry, Be Happy: The Keys to Maintaining Health and Vitality
Andropause
There’s new interest in treating age-related hor-
mone deficiencies in men, often referred to as
andropause. In the past doctors often diag-
nosed male hormone-related issues as depres-
sion, early diabetes, or just old age. New testing
of hormone levels and the subsequent treat-
ments have shown promising results for people
with low testosterone and human growth hor-
mone (a hormone released from the pituitary
that can decline with age). If you’re deficient,
treatment can improve libido, erections, energy,
and weight and muscle management. If you
think you could have hormone deficiencies, talk
to your doctor about the available testing.

 New underwear: Liven things up a bit. Ditch the granny panties and the
tighty whiteys for something more visually stimulating and fun. You can
always pretend that you’re buying those thongs for your granddaughter!
Or shop online — no one will ever know.
 Sex toys: Don’t be embarrassed; they sell these toys online now, and
they may help by stimulating areas you didn’t even know you had.
Above all sex is supposed to be fun — let it be.

T
here have always been old wives’ tales related to health issues, passed
down as family sayings or basic truisms. And then came the Internet,
with its explosion of information, misinformation, myths, and just plain non-
sense. Sorting out truth from fiction isn’t easy when it comes to health issues.
In this chapter, we look at some common misconceptions of healthy aging
and give you the facts about some of the things you may have taken as gospel
most of your life.
High Cholesterol Is Linked to Weight
If you’re thin, it may not even occur to you to check your cholesterol. The
myth that people with high cholesterol are overweight can be a dangerous
one. You can have high cholesterol and be as thin as a whispering willow.
How can that be?
Any body type can have high cholesterol. Cholesterol comes from two sources:
the foods you eat and what your body naturally makes based on heredity. You
have control over the amount of cholesterol you eat, but cholesterol levels are
influenced even more by your genetics. You should start getting your choles-
terol levels checked at age 20 or earlier if you have a family history of heart 
disease. Take responsibility for your health by learning how to interpret the
numbers, including HDL (good) cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and triglyc-
eride levels.

Talk with your doctor about modifying your lifestyle or your potential risk
factors. If you do have high cholesterol, follow all your doctor’s instructions,
and have your cholesterol retested as your doctor recommends. See Chapter 2
for more info on high cholesterol.
High Blood Pressure Is 
Caused by High Stress
Everyone feels stress at one time or another, but stress isn’t the cause of
ongoing high blood pressure. In fact, doctors aren’t completely sure what
causes high blood pressure. Many risk factors have been cited and stress is
often included in the list, but there hasn’t been a direct link between the two.
With that said, stressors can elevate the heart rate and blood pressure, but
they then return to baseline. There are many people that are placed under
stress and don’t have elevations in their blood pressure. Often, the stressed
individuals that do see ongoing elevations have also added several other
blood pressure elevating factors into their lifestyle, such as smoking, being

Women Shouldn’t Worry 
About Heart Disease
If you tell a woman that she’s more likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than
breast cancer, she may not believe you. Why? According to a recent study,
women think heart disease is a man’s disease and cancer is the disease that
most women die from. Not true. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in
women and is responsible for nearly twice as many deaths in women than all
cancers combined, including breast cancer. Some of the reasons why this
myth isn’t true are that women are smoking more, working more, and often
aren’t as aggressively screened for heart disease.
Since the initiation of some national programs targeting heart disease in
women, there has been a large jump in the number of women that now know
that heart disease is a deadly disease for women and that they need to be
pro-active in their care. Refer to Chapters 2 and 12 for more information on
cardiovascular disease and how to avoid it.

Osteoporosis Is a Normal Part of Aging
Brittle bones, fractured hips, and humpbacks aren’t part of normal aging. Not
everyone develops osteoporosis, and even if you’re at risk (see Chapter 6),
there are measures you can take to prevent it. The earlier in life you start pre-
venting, the better, because you hit your maximum bone mass in your 30s.
Stacking up on bone-building activities like strength and resistance training
as well as weight-bearing exercise enables you to use the force of gravity
against your muscles to push the calcium into your bones. This can reduce
the rate of bone loss. See Chapter 10 for specific ways to increase bone den-
sity through weight training.
Only Smokers Get Lung Cancer
The rate of people being diagnosed with lung cancer who’ve never smoked is
increasing, particularly among women. According to the American Cancer
Society (ACS), about 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women with lung
cancer never smoked. Two possible reasons are secondhand smoke and
genetics.
Stanford University medical oncologist Heather Wakelee’s research indicated
that a nonsmoker who’s married to a smoker has a 30 percent greater risk of
developing lung cancer than the spouse of a nonsmoker. While it’s possible
that the reason women have a greater risk than men is because it’s more
common for men to smoke than women, women would still be exposed to 
the secondhand smoke of their spouses.
Genetics may be another factor for developing lung cancer in people who
never smoked, as in the case of actress Dana Reeves (widow of actor
Christopher Reeves) who was diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 44.
According to the ACS, only 3 percent of lung cancers occur in people under
45, regardless of smoking status.
People with Darker Skin Don’t 
Need to Wear Sunscreen
You may have heard that people with dark skin are naturally protected from
the sun’s ultraviolet A and B (UVA and UVB) rays, so they don’t need to wear
sunscreen. Although dark skin does contain more melanin — the pigment
317
Chapter 16: Ten Medical Myths that Can Affect Your Health

responsible for determining skin color — it’s not true that dark skin can’t be
burned or damaged. Melanocytes are pigment-producing cells that make
more melanin (and thus create a tan) when you expose your skin to the sun.
Melanin is your skin’s natural defense system against burning, so there is
some truth that dark skin provides some protection against sun damage.
So regardless of your skin type, remember to protect your skin in the sun by
liberally applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen of sun protection factor (SPF)
15 or more and by wearing sun-protective clothing. Check out Chapter 5 for
more information about protecting your skin.
If you think that SPF 1000 is better than SPF 30, here’s the truth about the
numbers: An SPF over 30 doesn’t increase the amount of blockage; it
increases the length of time you can stay in the sun without burning. 
Once you get past SPF 30, the higher SPF creams are more expensive, so 
save your money and stop at SPF 30.
Herbs Are Natural, So 
They Can’t Hurt You
Just because something’s natural, doesn’t mean that it’s guaranteed to be
safe. Many herbs can be harmful or even deadly if ingested. And herbal prod-
ucts and supplements that are advertised as natural aren’t necessarily nat-
ural to the human body. Many herbs interact with over-the-counter (OTC)
and prescription medications, making it difficult for your doctor to manage
medications.
Find a good pocket consumer guide that explains terminology. Also, read labels
and talk with your doctor before taking these natural products, especially if
you’re taking other medications.
The Older You Get, The 
Less Sleep You Need
Did you ever wonder why Grandma was up at 4 a.m. when you had no trouble
sleeping in until 10 a.m.? Well, Grandma may have gotten used to waking
before the dawn, but she still needs sleep — she just can’t get all she needs.
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

As you age, you tend to lose the ability to sleep as deeply at nighttime. Your
sleep cycles naturally change, causing a gradual degradation of the sleep/
wake process (see Chapter 14 for details). So, you may sleep more lightly and
for shorter time spans as you get older, but you generally need about the
same amount of sleep as you need in early adulthood.
This fact explains why older people take naps — in an attempt to catch up on
their sleep, which unfortunately isn’t possible. About half of all people over
65 have frequent sleeping problems like insomnia. This change is mainly due
to aging, but other factors that may contribute are medical problems and the
medications to treat those problems. See Chapter 14 for more details about
the different stages of sleep.
As You Age, You Can’t Build Muscle
While body building may not be high on most senior’s “to do” list, building
muscle is more important than ever as a person ages and it is possible. Muscle
mass declines with age — with each decade after age 25, 3 to 5 percent 
of muscle mass is lost. However, studies also have shown that there can be
significant improvements in muscle strength in previously sedentary older
adults that follow a regular exercise program.
The American College of Sports Medicine now recommends weight training
for people over 50 — even people well into their 90s can benefit. A group of
nursing home residents ranging in age from 87 to 96 recently improved their
muscle strength by almost 180 percent after just eight weeks of strength
training. Adding that much strength gave these folks significant functionality
that they thought they had permanently lost. See Chapter 10 for more on
building lean muscle mass.
Eating Late at Night Is Less 
Healthy Than Eating Early
If you eat a bowl of chocolate ice cream at midnight, it has the same number
of calories no matter when they’re consumed. But it’s not the full stomach at
bedtime that puts on the extra pounds; it’s the extra calories — no matter
when you eat them.
319
Chapter 16: Ten Medical Myths that Can Affect Your Health

You’re likely to experience discomfort at night and the next morning if you
eat late at night. Here’s why:
 Your food may only partially digest: Food left in the stomach leads to
heartburn, indigestion, and, as a result, the inability to fall sleep. Lying
in a prone position doesn’t allow gravity to pull food down the digestive
track. Late-night eating can also cause morning gas and stomach cramps.
 Your body is using its energy on digestion when it should be in energy-
save mode: One primary function of sleep is to help you recuperate from
the day. You want your body to be as relaxed as possible so you can wake
up energized.
Generally, don’t eat two to three hours before bed to allow your body suffi-
cient time for digestion. If you’re not starving, the best option is to have
some water and call it a night, but don’t go to bed hungry, because you can
have a restless night of sleep, too. If you’re hungry and you do eat, try some-
thing small and healthy like a snack with protein to help you feel more full
such as an ounce of mixed nuts, a salad, or a cup of yogurt. This way you
don’t overeat or significantly raise your caloric count while risking a long
night of heartburn. The best way to avoid being hungry at night is to drink
enough water and eat at least five small meals during the day rather than the
normal 2 to 3 meals. This helps maximize your metabolism and also your
blood sugars.

Ten Foods to Help You 
Age Healthfully

 Counting on the benefits of fish, grain, soy, and nuts
 Satisfying more than your sweet tooth with healthy dark chocolate
I
s there a magic food that can act as a fountain of youth? Of course not. But
some foods are really good for you and keep your body functioning at its
best. In this chapter, we list ten important, healthful foods that can help you
stay young, provided that you also adopt the other lifestyle changes that we
guide you through in this book. Whether these foods target your heart, bones
and joints, free radicals, or cancer, they are supported by research to promote
healthy aging. These foods — when combined — provide the most nutritional
bang for your bite. Bon appetite!
Blueberries
Blueberries are one of the highest food sources of vitamins A, C, dietary fiber,
iron, folic acid, and ellagic acid (a disease-fighting phytochemical that slows
down tumor formation). They contain specific phytonutrients that maximize
the use of vitamin C in your body and contain more disease-fighting antioxi-
dants than most other foods. In fact, their Oxygen Radical Absorbance
Capacity (ORAC — a lab test analysis that measures the total antioxidant
properties of foods and other chemical substances) score is a very high 2,400
units! To compare, the recommended “5-a-day” fruits and veggies gives you
an ORAC score of 1750 units. By eating plenty of high-ORAC fruits and vegeta-
bles, you may help slow the aging processes in your body and your brain.
One cup of blueberries is only 84 calories and contains no cholesterol or fat.

The blueberry has these additional benefits:
 The deep blue skin contains anthocyanin, a plant flavonoid (plant metabo-
lite that has high antioxidant activity) that contributes to heart and brain
health by protecting blood vessels from oxidation and helping maintain 
a healthy cholesterol balance.
 It may improve your coordination, strength, and memory.
Broccoli
Broccoli is a member of the cabbage family of vegetables and contains two
significant cancer-fighting phytonutrients: sulforaphane and indole. This
green veggie is packed with powerful antioxidants such as vitamin A, C, beta
carotene, querectin, glutathione, and lutein. Broccoli actually has more vita-
min C than an orange!
In addition, broccoli
 Is one of the richest food sources of trace metal chromium, a hard-to-find
nutrient that has the ability to normalize blood-sugar concentrations,
which could be effective in preventing adult-onset diabetes in some
people
 Helps a woman’s body inactivate the harmful type of estrogen that 
promotes cancer
 Is a great source of calcium for bone health — it contains as much 
calcium as milk, ounce for ounce
One cup of cooked broccoli contains 74 mg of calcium plus 123 mg of 
vitamin C, which significantly improves calcium’s absorption — all for
only 44 calories.
Dark Chocolate
Dark chocolate (as in, 70 percent cocoa or more, so milk chocolate doesn’t
count!) has many benefits:
 Contains epicatechin, a flavonoid, that increases blood flow through
your arteries. Better blood flow is good for your heart
 Contains essential trace elements and nutrients such as iron, calcium,
phosphorus, and potassium, as well as the vitamins A, B1, C, D, and E
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Has the highest natural source of magnesium, which protects against
hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease
 Contains oleic acid, which raises HDL (good cholesterol)
 Contains phenylethylamine (PEA), a mild mood elevator (your brain 
naturally produces PEA when you feel joy or love)
 Boosts serotonin (your brain’s antidepressant) and endorphin levels
 Produces smoother-looking, thicker, and better-hydrated skin
 Helps protect your skin from sun damage (when it’s fortified with cocoa
flavonols) by making your skin more tolerant of UV sunlight
How much chocolate can you eat? Some studies that looked at cocoa phenols
recommend eating as much as 100 grams of dark chocolate a day to get the
blood-pressure-lowering potential (there’s not enough research to support
throwing away the blood pressure medications just yet), but watch out for
the calories. That amount can have as many as 500 calories!
Green Tea
Green tea comes from the leaves of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis, a bush
native to Asia. The leaves of green tea plants are less processed than regular
black tea and carry a bigger supply of antioxidants and phytochemicals,
which can decrease plaque forming in arteries. The main body booster in
green tea is catechin (epigallocatechin-3-gallate), a powerful antioxidant that
does the following:
 Protects against digestive and respiratory infections
 Blocks the actions of carcinogens (substances that promote cancer)
 Acts as an antibacterial (some people use as a mouth rinse)
 Helps lower triglycerides and raises your HDL
 Blocks the production of prostaglandin E2, a hormone-like substance
that is responsible for joint inflammation
To receive maximum health benefits, drink four to five cups of green tea a
day (80 to 107 mg of polyphenols per cup). Green tea extract is available in
capsule form for doses of 100 to 150 mg three times a day. Remember that
green tea contains caffeine and might not be appropriate for everyone, so
talk to your doctor to see if drinking this much tea is okay for you.
Decaffeinated green tea is also available.
323
Chapter 17: Ten Foods to Help You Age Healthfully

Nuts
Nuts are packed full of healthy monounsaturated fats (which can reduce
coronary heart disease), antioxidants, vitamin E, protein, fiber, calcium, iron,
selenium, and magnesium. A little goes a long way — eat one ounce a day to
fill you up and reap the benefits. Nuts contain about 150 to 170 calories per
quarter cup, so make sure to measure.
Vitamin E in nuts may help protect your cell membranes from free radical
damage. Cardiac benefits include decreased oxidation of LDL cholesterol
(bad) and improved functioning of the blood vessels.
Walnuts, the nut studied the most, give you a healthy dose of omega-3 essen-
tial fatty acids (see that section later in the chapter). Almonds are the richest
source of calcium and are great for vegans and people with dairy allergies.
Oatmeal
Oats are full of antioxidants, vitamin E, selenium, magnesium, fiber, and many
other bioactive compounds. High fiber oats lower cholesterol, aid in good
digestion, and may help your memory performance. The high fiber and pro-
tein content in oatmeal helps to slow down digestion and promote a slower
and moresustained release of glucose into your bloodstream. This controlled
release of glucose keeps you feeling satisfied from hunger longer.
In addition, high fiber oats seem to improve insulin sensitivity (which often
worsens prior to the onset of diabetes) by keeping blood sugars stable and
reduce your risk factors for cardiovascular disease by lowering your LDL
cholesterol.
A cup of cooked oatmeal provides 4 grams of total fiber, which includes 2
grams of soluble fiber. Soluble fiber binds with fatty acids (such as trans fatty
acids — trans fat, which raises your LDL and lowers your HDL), and removes
them from your body.
Mix 1 to 2 tablespoons of flax seed in your oatmeal for a great cholesterol-
lowering breakfast that’s packed with fiber and omega-3 fatty acids.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
As you age, your brain function gradually slows due to slower transmission of
nerve impulses and worn-out brain cell membranes. Because omega-3 fatty
acids are the primary components of your brain cell membrane, the omega-3
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

oils in fish can slow down brain aging by helping to make the myelin (the
insulation around the nerves) stronger so nerve impulses travel faster.
Research supports that these fatty acids reduce the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease. They’ve been found to directly reduce risks by their beneficial effects on
cholesterol, heart rhythm, and clotting. Eating fish and getting more omega 3s
also indirectly helps reduce heart disease, because fish is a healthy alternative
to other protein choices with higher saturated fat content, such as beef.
But for the most part, omega-3 fats provide these benefits:
 Help neurotransmitters (the brain’s chemical messengers) function 
optimally
 Help improve memory and clear thinking
 Can reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease
 Lower triglycerides, increase HDL, lower blood pressure, and reduce risk
of blood clots that can lead to stroke
 May ease arthritis, asthma, and even depression
 Help reduce wrinkles from sun exposure
You can get omega-3s by eating fish (like mackerel, tuna, and salmon) or taking
fish oil supplements. High-quality supplements are harvested from oils in 
the fishes’ bodies and then purified and deodorized.
Soy
Soy is a unique combination of complex carbohydrates and protein that can
be eaten in a variety of ways (think soy burger, soy beans, soy milk, and so
on). Regular soy intake can lower and balance cholesterol, reducing your risk
of coronary heart disease.
Note: Soy foods that claim to help reduce the risk of heart disease must con-
tain at least 6.25 grams of soy protein per serving. The label has to specify
that you need at least 25 grams of soy protein every day (four servings) to
see any benefit.
Other benefits of soy include the following:
 A high soy diet increases bone density after six months.
 Twenty grams a day decreases hot flashes.
 Soy foods lower blood pressure.
 Isoflavonoids (antioxidants), such as genistein and daidzein, are weak
estrogens that may lessen the risk of osteoporosis and heart disease.
325
Chapter 17: Ten Foods to Help You Age Healthfully

Tomatoes
Tomatoes are rich in several nutrients: potassium, which decreases calcium
loss; vitamin A, which maintains skin tissue; vitamin C; calcium; and iron.
Tomatoes (particularly cooked tomatoes, such as tomato sauce and even
ketchup) are also the best food source for lycopene, a phytochemical with
potent antioxidant effects that has been linked to reducing cancer of the
cervix, colon, bladder, stomach, and prostate and promoting heart health.
This food actually is better when processed. The cooking of the tomatoes
releases more lycopene from the skin.
Yogurt
As you age, your digestion and intestinal immunity slow down and bones
weaken. Yogurt contains vital nutrients (protein and calcium) to combat
these natural declines. Many yogurts also add vitamin D to further support
your bones. The probiotics (see Chapter 8) in yogurt are beneficial bacteria,
and they enhance the growth of healthy bacteria throughout your digestive
system and keep harmful bacteria in balance.
When choosing a yogurt, look for one with the most live and active cultures
(some have as many as six). Check out Chapter 8 for more information on
probiotics.

 Exercising your powers of strategizing and reasoning
W
ant to improve your brain? Give it something to think about! Your
brain, like every other part of your body, could use a little exercise to
stay in shape — mental exercise, in this case. Exercising your brain is easy
and fun. Puzzles, board games, and word play can sharpen your memory,
heighten your verbal and numeric skills, and increase your spatial ability.
Better yet, keeping your brain in shape can help stave off memory loss and
dementia in your later years.
In this chapter, we discuss ten types of puzzles and games that give your brain
a great, balanced workout. We don’t provide actual puzzles here because con-
cocting those isn’t our strong suit — but the For Dummies series has a whole
slew of great puzzle and game books that tell you how to play the games and
provide the strategies to boot. We also provide the Web addresses of several
mind-building games online in case you’re the technical sort.
Crossword Puzzles
Crosswords challenge your memory skills as well as your verbal language
acuity. Doing crossword puzzles stimulates the temporal lobes of your brain,
which helps you identify sounds and understand speech. The temporal lobes
also contain the hippocampus, which is important for short-term memory.

You can find these classic brain trainers in newspapers, but they’re also avail-
able on the Internet, in books, magazines, and on CDs. You can even create
your own. There are even crosswords devoted to specific subjects as well 
as in varying degrees of difficulty. A few of our favorite sources include the
following:
 USA TODAY: You can work the hard copy or the one online at http://
puzzles.usatoday.com.
 The Washington Post: The Sunday and daily puzzles are good choices.
 The New York Times: To access this crossword puzzle, you must sub-
scribe to receive the paper, and you’ll get one free per week.

Sudoku Puzzles
Sudoku is a highly addictive strategic number placement game that relies on
logic and reasoning. The puzzles consist of a 9-x-9 square grid subdivided into
nine 3-x-3 square grids. The object of the game is to place a number in each
square; each row, column, and 3-x-3 square must contain all the numbers 1
through 9, with no duplicates. The puzzles come with a handful of squares
already filled in, so you have to look ahead and follow trails of consequences.
This activity is a “left brain” kind of game because it deals with logic and rea-
soning skills. Sudoku uses working memory (memory for temporarily storing
and manipulating information). Check out The Big Book of Sudoku For
Dummies by Andrew Heron (Wiley) for a fun memory challenge.
Strategy Games
Strategy board games like chess, checkers, backgammon, and battle games,
and card games like pinochle, Hearts, and Bridge, have long been popular ways
of developing and challenging a person’s decision-making abilities, reasoning
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

skills, and critical thinking skills. These games focus on the outcome, so the
thought process requires forward thinking. They help stretch the mind by
requiring you to concentrate on the next several moves ahead.
Because strategy games require at least two players (one of which can be a
computer), you have to consider not only your next move but also your
opponent’s. Part of knowing what your opponent is going to do may involve
reading their body language, which utilizes your temporal lobes to “read”
facial expression, and the parietal lobes, which react to changes in speech
tone. The more players, the more different personalities and competitive
expressions that can be observed, studied, and then used in your strategy 
for winning.
There are local and national tournaments for many of these strategy games;
you’ll see that there are often repeat winners. These people have honed their
strategic and observational skills, and you can do the same! Take a look at
Card Games For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley) by Barry Rigal and Omar Sharif
to find out more about a variety of card games.
Jigsaw Puzzles
Jigsaw puzzles work with spatial relations and memory skills as well as fine
motor skills for picking up and putting together the pieces. There is also a cre-
ative element to solving jigsaw puzzles because you’re constructing pictures.
Create your own puzzles. Buy the blank puzzles at craft stores or teachers’
supply stores, and make your own design (you can even print a photo right
from your own printer). When you have finished that, you break apart the
pieces and put them back together. This way of getting your creative juices
flowing uses your right brain and costs less than a couple of bucks.
Word Games
Do you have a way with words? If you do, there are dozens of games to test
your word recognition, vocabulary, and ability to decipher words, all which
stimulate your hippocampus, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, and temporal lobes
(see Chapter 12 for info on the brain). Cryptograms, anagrams, and Jumbles
are all puzzles that involve substituting or unscrambling letters and are often
found in daily newspapers, as well as online.
There are also some great word board games you can play, such as Boggle,
Scrabble, and Balderdash. Go to www.wordplays.com for a variety of word
puzzles that can keep your brain sizzling for hours.

Chapter 18: Ten Mind Games to Boost Your Brainpower

Short-Term Memory Quizzes
The average person’s short-term memory can hold about seven pieces of
information. Short-term memory games help you determine and even stretch
that limit. These games have many practical applications including remem-
bering to take medicine and making a list of items to buy at the grocery store.
You may remember playing games like this as a child; often they utilize letters
of the alphabet to help you remember a list of items. One example would be,
“I’m going on a trip and taking . . . “ and then saying something beginning with
the letter A. The next person then adds something beginning with B but includ-
ing the A item too, and so on. The person who remembers the longest without
mistakes wins.
Online games allow you to make up your own variation and play with a friend.
Try www.allstarpuzzles.com, which has a number of memory puzzles
with different themes.
Some games have someone say three numbers like 13, 4, and 26. After a cer-
tain amount of time, you have to repeat them back to the person. Increase
the degree of difficulty by adding more numbers in the series (up to seven),
by mixing categories like apple, telescope, car keys, waiter, or by increasing
the amount of time before recalling the items (from five minutes to one hour).
You can also play this game with pictures or flash cards to incorporate the
visual element — better yet, use old family photos to match up or quiz over
(ever wonder what you were going to do with that second set of pictures that
you got for free?).
Sports
Many athletes say that a game is more mental than physical. For example:
 Basketball: Playing basketball takes strategic thinking to analyze what
opposing players will do to try and prevent you from getting to the basket.
 Baseball or softball: A baseball or softball player must focus on the pitch,
see what type of throw is coming, at what rate of speed, any curve, and
calculate all these aspects together to determine how and when to swing.
 Golf: Golf is thought to be one of the best combinations of physical and
mental skill. When you golf, you’re trying to get the best score you can,
which is independent of the others you’re playing with. Every shot takes
thought, planning, focus, and relaxation. If any one of these lapses, you
risk a bad shot and the negativity that comes with it. After a bad shot
330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

you must refocus and overcome the negativity and anger that usually
leads to lack of concentration and a quick downhill slide. The physical
skill is hard enough to master, but to manage the mental components on
every shot for 18 holes can be a real mental challenge!
Based on your current fitness level, lifestyle, and interests, look for a sport
that benefits your mind and body, whether it’s a game of golf, tennis, ping-
pong, or playing catch with the grandkids. Note: Cheering on your favorite
team from the couch doesn’t count!
There are mental benefits that come with physical activity. The aerobic activ-
ity in sports increases oxygen to the brain and also causes the release of
endorphins (chemicals released by the brain), which give you energy and a
sense of well-being. We discuss them in more detail in Chapter 12 where we
discuss endorphin release.
Optical Illusions
As you get older, it’s easy to fall into a rut — looking at things from the same
perspective. Optical illusions are a fun way to train your brain to look at
things from different angles and to see more than what’s immediately obvi-
ous. The more optical illusions you look at, the better you get at spotting the
“hidden pictures.” You can buy books of optical illusions, or try your eye at
the illusions found at the following sites:
 www.brainden.com/optical-illusions.htm
 www.eyetricks.com
Visualization and Meditation
Visualizing is a great workout for your brain. Pick a specific memory and
recall everything you can. Think about smells, what you were wearing, what
you were thinking about, and so on. For example, visualize a sunset you
remember. Then picture the beach, the sand, the fading sun rays on your
face, the water on your toes, and smell the salt air.
Spend at least 15 minutes just visualizing every detail with each of your
senses. This simple workout exercises almost all functions of the brain: the
five senses, your memory, the ability to consciously relax, and so on. Repeat
daily (with different memories) for a great brain-fitness routine.
331
Chapter 18: Ten Mind Games to Boost Your Brainpower

Philosophical Reasoning
Reasoning is an important — and practical — function of the brain. Practice
reasoning by asking the question “Why?” Children are great at this process
and begin at about age three. Every question is “Why?” Why does the dog
have spots? Why are leaves green? Why are pillows soft? Children learn and
discover the world this way, and you can stimulate your reasoning skills by
doing the same.
Just thinking about the possible answers to these questions forces your brain
to use logic and intuition. Be just as curious about the world around you as a
child, no matter how silly or reasonable your questions are.
Try this simple exercise:
1. Pick an object, action, or topic to think about, and lie back and con-
template it for 30 minutes to an hour, working through all possible
answers.
2. When you’re tired of thinking, let it go and move on.
Some questions don’t have answers, but they’re still good to think about
because of the strengthening effect they have on your mind and your
ability to communicate reason.
Be careful not to let your thoughts drift toward a resentment or bad feelings
you may be carrying when you’re doing this exercise. Problem-solving is
great mental work, but the goal is to grow your mind, not wear it down.

Ten Ways to Make Your 
Home Safer as You Age
In This Chapter
 Organizing your home to prevent injury
 Minding your meds for safety
 Preparing for emergencies
H
ome may be the place you feel safest, but statistically, it’s the place
you’re most likely to be injured. People age 65 and older consistently
experience the highest numbers of home-injury-related deaths. Preventing
injuries at home is common sense, but most people don’t think about danger-
ous situations until they get injured. In this chapter, we offer some hints to
stay safe at home at any age.
Preventing Falls
Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths and the most common cause of
nonfatal injuries and hospital admissions for trauma. Each year in the U.S.
nearly one-third of older adults experience a fall. Check out these suggestions
to keep yourself from becoming a statistic:
 Install a hand rail — that extends the full length of the stairs — on each
side of all stairs in your house.
 Keep all stairways, pathways, and walkways well lit and free of clutter.
 Get rid of all throw rugs and carpets with corners that can flip up or
have them taped down tight to the floor.
 Install grab bars along the toilets and showers, and use a non-slip mat or
adhesive safety strips inside the bath or shower.
 Wear sturdy shoes with thin, non-slip soles.
 Stay off ladders and don’t climb on chairs, because poor vision and bal-
ance contribute to falls.

You also want to do your part to keep your sense of balance and flexibility.
Maintain an active lifestyle that includes exercise as part of your daily routine
with a focus on balance, strength, and flexibility. And if you experience dizzi-
ness, consult your doctor to see what’s at fault.
In Case of Fire . . . Plan Ahead
A home fire is dangerous at any age, but the odds of injury increase when you
get older. To prevent injury from fire, do the following:
 Install smoke alarms on every level of your home and test them monthly.
Change smoke alarm batteries at least once a year. New systems avail-
able can be wired so if one alarm goes off it sets off all the alarms.
 Develop and practice a fire escape plan with your family that identifies
two exits out of every room with a place to meet outside.
 Buy a hanging escape ladder for rooms on the second story.
 Install alarms on the stove or an automatic shut-off for the times when
the stove is accidentally left on. Never leave food cooking on the stove
while you leave the room.
 Don’t smoke in bed. If possible, don’t smoke in the house at all — a 
cigarette left burning outside is much less likely to cause a house fire.
Be Sure Your Meds Are Safe
With every year, the number of prescription and non prescription medica-
tions you take is likely to grow. Keeping the pills you take straight can be a
real challenge, even if you aren’t suffering from memory loss. Taking the
wrong medication is more common than you may think and depending on the
med and how much you took, can be very dangerous.
If you suspect you have taken the wrong medication or took a dose twice by
mistake, call your doctor first. If your doctor isn’t available, call the Poison
Control Hotline at (800) 222-1222 or 911.
Other safety precautions include the following:
 Use a medications tracker. This tool indicates which medication to take
when and what dose with instructions, such as taking pills with food.
This tracker helps minimize error. You can register for some services to
call and remind you to take your meds.
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Get a pill box. This method is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to
keep your meds straight. There’s a covered compartment for each day 
of the week, so you have your medication for a week organized, and you
can see if you remembered to take your pills because, if you didn’t,
they’re still in the compartment.
 Ask your doctor if there’s a way to simplify your schedule. Can you
take any of your meds just once a day, in a higher dose, rather than
twice a day? Never change your medication schedule on your own.
 Get rid of old medication. Call your local hospital or doctor to find out
how to dispose of unwanted or expired medications to eliminate the
possibility of taking the wrong medications or expired medications that
may be harmful rather than helpful.
 Post emergency numbers. Next to every phone in the home, list the
numbers of Poison Control and other numbers you or someone else
assisting you may need in an emergency.
Stock Your Emergency Supply Kit
No matter what your age, a first aid kit in a convenient and memorable location
(next to your kitchen fire extinguisher, for example) is a must. Refresh and
restock your first aid kit twice a year, replacing any expired or missing sup-
plies. Have enough supplies to survive for three days. Include the following:
 Sterile adhesive bandages and Band-Aids in assorted sizes
 Hypoallergenic adhesive tape and sterile roller bandages (2- and 3-inch)
 Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen
 Benadryl
 Calamine lotion
 Antibiotic ointment
 Hydrocortisone cream
 Antiseptic wipes
 Hot/cold packs
 Thermometer
 Tweezers
 Small scissors or other cutting tool
 Light source (flashlight) with extra batteries
335
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Make Your Home Safer as You Age

 CPR mouthpiece
 Disposable rubber gloves
 Phone numbers for poison control and emergency contacts
Update Your Life-Saving Skills
Do you know what to do if someone is having a heart attack? Acting quickly
can save a life. One way is through cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
When you’re able to perform CPR on someone during a heart attack, you can
help save her life until emergency help arrives. Look for a CPR class near you
through the American Heart Association, your local fire department, or a 
hospital.
Consider purchasing your own automated external defibrillator (AED), an
instrument specifically designed for home use to help save a life. The FDA
may require someone who purchases an AED to present a physician’s pre-
scription for the device. They cost between $1,500 to $2,000.
While you’re at it, learn the Heimlich maneuver. According to the U.S.
Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the death rate 
due to choking is highest among people over age 75.
Let Lighting Lead Your Way
Too often people overlook the importance of good lighting; it’s one of the best
and least-expensive insurances against home injuries. As age progresses, vision
changes. In general, after age 40, your eyes function best for distant viewing, so
exceptionally good light is important in all areas of the home, especially the
kitchen, laundry, other work areas, and over steps.
The following suggestions can get you started toward a safer environment:
 Install a night light in your bathroom.
 Install overhead lights to illuminate all areas of a room.
 Install task lighting under counters in the kitchen.
 Install overhead lights over the entryway so visitors can be seen.
 Consider outside motion sensors that automatically turn on when 
visitors (expected or unexpected) make an appearance.
336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Reach Easily
As you age, your body has a harder time maintaining balance and finding its
equilibrium, so reaching for objects becomes more of a challenge, increasing
the likelihood of an injury in the process. These suggestions may help:
 Incorporate adjustable upper shelves, pull-out lower shelves, and Lazy
Susans into your cabinets and closets.
 Replace cabinet knobs or pulls and sink faucets with levers for easier
handling.
 Keep the items you use often low and within reach to avoid climbing on
ladders and stools.
 Enlist the help of family or neighbors to move items so they’re within
your reach.
Bathe Safely
The bathroom seems one of the most popular places for home accidents. To
minimize the possibilities there, follow these guidelines:
 Install grab bars and rails to reduce falls around the tub and toilet.
 Consider a stall shower with a low threshold and shower seat instead of
a tub if you’re planning to remodel.
 Remove bath mats or double-tape them down and place non-slip sur-
faces in the tub or shower.
 Clean up water spills immediately.
 Wear an in-home personal emergency response system that automati-
cally calls for help in case you injure yourself and can’t get to the phone.
The elderly are in the top 90 percent risk group for being burned by hot water
(the others are children under 4 and the mentally disabled). The thermostat
on the hot water heater should be set below 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
Prevent Poisoning
Poisoning is the third-leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in
the home among older adults, and certainly one of the most preventable.
Take a look at these three poison sources:
337
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Make Your Home Safer as You Age

 Carbon monoxide (CO): Carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading
cause of accidental poisoning deaths in America. Install at least one
carbon monoxide detector near your sleeping areas. A CO detector
sounds an alarm if too much CO is present. Major sources of CO come
from tobacco smoke, an idling car in the garage, combustion appliances
(gas or kerosene heaters), and fireplaces.
 Food poisoning: Many elderly people have the inability to do everyday
tasks, such as preparing meals and grocery shopping. As a result, many
may eat food that’s past its expiration date, resulting in food poisoning.
In some cases, this can lead to dehydration from gastrointestinal distress.
 Chemical poisoning: Keep all chemicals (including common household
cleaners) away from food and stored in different containers than non-food
items. Choose non-toxic products when you can. Avoid mixing chemicals
because some chemical reactions can cause watery eyes, nausea, and
vomiting. Only use chemicals in well-ventilated areas. Older people are
more prone to accidental spillage due to loss of muscle strength and can’t
tolerate or escape the fumes as quickly.
Make Sure that You Can See Clearly Now
Vision loss is very common as you age. An entire industry is devoted to making
things easier to see to prevent problems as you get older. Some of the visual
aides that can help include
 Talking blood pressure cuffs, blood glucose monitors, and thermometers
 Marked stove dials so you can tell the temperature setting by feel
 Large magnifying glasses to enlarge instructions on pill bottles
 Boil alert gadgets that fit on a pan and rattle when the water is boiling
 Liquid level indicators that fit on your cup and buzz when the liquid is
an inch from the top
One good source of low-vision aids is www.lhb.org, the Web site for
Lighthouse for the Blind. The toll free number is (888) 792-0163.

Family History
Knowing about your family history is more complicated than just putting
together your family tree, although this is a good start. Your family’s medical
history is very important in determining your health maintenance examina-
tions, screenings, and other necessary testing.
Just because certain ailments or diseases may run in the family doesn’t guar-
antee that you’ll have them, too. Lifestyle habits can affect risks as well as
prevent several conditions. So don’t give up on good health if your family 
history reveals “bad” genes, just work harder to overcome them with good
nutrition, healthy exercise habits, and smart lifestyle choices.
The following answers help determine your genetic risks:
1. Please indicate family members (parent, sibling, grandparent, aunt, or
uncle) with any of the following conditions: (Check all boxes that apply
and list relationship)
❑Alcoholism _______________
❑Asthma/COPD _______________
