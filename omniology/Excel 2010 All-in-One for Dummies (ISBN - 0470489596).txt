About the Author
Greg Harvey has authored tons of computer books, the most recent being 
Excel 2010 For Dummies, Windows 7 For Dummies Quick Reference, and Excel 
2010 Workbook For Dummies. He started out training business users on how 
to use IBM personal computers and their attendant computer software in the 
rough-and-tumble days of DOS, WordStar, and Lotus 1-2-3 in the mid-eighties 
of the last century. After working for a number of independent training fi rms, 
he went on to teaching semester-long courses in spreadsheet and database 
management software at Golden Gate University in San Francisco.
His love of teaching has translated into an equal love of writing. For Dummies 
books are, of course, his all-time favorites to write because they enable him 
to write to his favorite audience, the beginner. They also enable him to use 
humor (a key element to success in the training room) and, most delightful of 
all, to express an opinion or two about the subject matter at hand.


Dedication
To all the students in my different computer classes who taught so much 
about what’s really important and what’s not when it comes to using com-
puter software.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I am always so grateful to the many people who work so hard to bring my 
book projects into being, and this one is no exception. If anything, I am even 
more thankful for their talents, given the size and complexity of an All-in-One.
This time, special thanks are in order to Andy Cummings and Katie Feltman 
for giving me this opportunity to write and write and write about Excel in this 
great All-in-One format. Next, I want to express great thanks to my project 
editor, Linda Morris. Thanks also go to Mike Talley for the great technical 
edit, to Sheree Montgomery for coordinating the book’s production, and to 
everybody at Wiley Publishing.

Introduction
E
xcel 2010 All-in-One For Dummies brings together plain and simple 
information on using all aspects of the latest and greatest version of 
Microsoft Excel. It’s designed to be of help no matter how much or how 
little experience you have with the program. As the preeminent spreadsheet 
and data analysis software for the personal computer, Excel offers its users 
seemingly unlimited capabilities too often masked in technical jargon and 
obscured by explanations only a software engineer could love. On top of 
that, many of the publications that purport to give you the lowdown on 
using Excel are quite clear on how to use particular features without giving 
you a clue as to why you would go to all the trouble.
The truth is that understanding how to use the abundance of features 
offered by Excel is only half the battle, at best. The other half of the battle 
is to understand how these features can benefit you in your work, in other 
words, “what’s in it for you.” I have endeavored to cover both the “how to” 
and “so what” aspects in all my discussions of Excel features, being as clear 
as possible and using as little tech-speak as possible.
Fortunately, Excel is well worth the effort to get to know because it’s defi-
nitely one of the best data processing productivity tools that has ever come 
along. Its all new Ribbon user interface, Live Preview feature, and tons of 
readymade galleries make this version of the program the easiest to use 
ever. In short, Excel 2010 is a blast to use when you know what you’re doing, 
and my great hope is that this “fun” aspect of using the program comes 
through on every page (or, at least, every other page).
About This Book
As the name states, Excel 2010 All-in-One For Dummies is a reference 
(whether you keep it on your desk or use it to prop up your desk is your 
business). This means that although the chapters in each book are laid out 
in a logical order, each stands on its own ready for you to dig into the infor-
mation at any point.
As much as possible, I have endeavored to make the topics within each 
chapter stand on their own. When there’s just no way around relying on 
some information that’s discussed elsewhere, I include a cross-reference 
that gives you the chapter and verse (actually the book and chapter) for 
where you can find that related information if you’re of a mind to.

2
Foolish Assumptions
Use the full Table of Contents and Index to look up the topic of the hour and 
find out exactly where it is in this compilation of Excel information. You’ll 
find that although most topics are introduced in a conversational manner, 
I don’t waste much time cutting to the chase by laying down the main prin-
ciples at work (usually in bulleted form) followed by the hard reality of how 
you do the deed (as numbered steps).
Foolish Assumptions
I’m only going to make one foolish assumption about you and that is that 
you have some need to use Microsoft Excel in your work or studies. If 
pushed, I further guess that you aren’t particularly interested in knowing 
Excel at an expert level but are terribly motivated to find out how to do the 
stuff you need to get done. If that’s the case, this is definitely the book for 
you. Fortunately, even if you happen to be one of those newcomers who’s 
highly motivated to become the company’s resident spreadsheet guru, 
you’ve still come to the right place.
As far as your hardware and software goes, I’m assuming that you already 
have Excel 2010 (usually as part of Microsoft Office 2010) installed on your 
computer, using a standard installation running under either Windows Vista 
or Windows XP.
 
This book is intended only for users of Microsoft Office Excel 2010! Because 
of the deep and significant changes to the user interface in Excel 2010, if 
you’re using a previous version of Excel for Windows from Excel 97 through 
2003, the information in this book will only confuse and confound you, 
as your version of Excel works nothing like the 2010 version this book 
describes.
If you’re using a version of Excel that is from 2003 or earlier, please put this 
book down slowly and instead pick up a copy of Excel 2003 All-in-One Desk 
Reference For Dummies, published by Wiley Publishing. If, however, you’re 
using Excel 2007, you will find slight differences between this and the 2010 
version that, although not major, nonetheless warrant purchasing the more 
recent, Excel 2007 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, also published by 
Wiley Publishing.
How This Book Is Organized
Excel 2010 All-in-One For Dummies is actually eight smaller books rolled into 
one. That way, you can go after the stuff in the particular book that really 
interests you at the time, putting all the rest of the material aside until you 

3
How This Book Is Organized
need to have a look at it. Each book in the volume consists of two or more 
chapters consisting of all the basic information you should need in dealing 
with that particular component or aspect of Excel.
In case you’re the least bit curious, here’s the lowdown on each of the eight 
books and what you can expect to find there.
Book I: Excel Basics
This book is for those of you who’ve never had a formal introduction to 
the program’s basic workings. Chapter 1 covers all the orientation mate-
rial including how to deal with the program’s new Ribbon user interface. Of 
special interest may be the section on migrating to Excel 2010 from earlier 
versions of Excel: This section is primarily intended to ease users who have 
some experience with earlier versions of Excel (97 through 2007) through 
the first moments of getting used to Excel’s new way of doing business.
Chapter 2 is your place to go to find out how to get online help in Excel. 
Believe it or not, after you have the All-in-One basics down, some of the 
online help topics actually start making sense!
Chapter 3 is not to be missed, even by those of you who do not consider 
yourselves beginners by any stretch of the imagination. This chapter covers 
the many ways to customize Excel and make the program truly your own. 
It includes information on customizing the Quick Access toolbar as well 
as great information on how to use and procure add-in programs that can 
greatly extend Excel’s considerable features.
Book II: Worksheet Design
Book II focuses on the crucial issue of designing worksheets in Excel. 
Chapter 1 takes up the call on how to do basic design and covers all the 
many ways of doing data entry (a subject that’s been made all the more 
exciting with the addition of voice and handwriting input).
Chapter 2 covers how to make your spreadsheet look professional and read 
the way you want it through formatting. Excel offers you a wide choice of for-
matting techniques, from the very simple formatting as a table all the way to 
the now very sophisticated and super-easy conditional formatting.
Chapter 3 takes up the vital subject of how to edit an existing spreadsheet 
without disturbing its design or contents. Editing can be intimidating to the 
new spreadsheet user because most spreadsheets not only contain data 
entries that you don’t want to mess up but formulas that can go haywire if 
you make the wrong move.

4
How This Book Is Organized
Chapter 4 looks at the topic of managing the worksheets that contain the 
spreadsheet applications that you build in Excel. It opens the possibility of 
going beyond the two-dimensional worksheet with its innumerable columns 
and rows by organizing data three-dimensionally through the use of multi-
ple worksheets (each Excel file already contains three blank worksheets 
to which you can add more). This chapter also shows you how to work 
with and organize multiple worksheets given the limited screen real estate 
afforded by your monitor and how to combine data from different files and 
sheets when needed.
Chapter 5 is all about printing your spreadsheets, a topic that ranks only 
second in importance to knowing how to get the data into a worksheet in the 
first place. As you expect, you find out not only how to get the raw data to 
spit out of your printer but also how to gussy it up and make it into a profes-
sional report of which anyone would be proud.
Book III: Formulas and Functions
This book is all about calculations and building the formulas that do them. 
Chapter 1 covers formula basics from doing the simplest addition to building 
array formulas and using Excel’s built-in functions courtesy of the Function 
Wizard. It also covers how to use different types of cell references when making 
formula copies and how to link formulas that span different worksheets.
Chapter 2 takes up the subject of preventing formula errors from occurring, 
and, barring that, how to track them down and eliminate them from the 
spreadsheet. This chapter also includes information on circular references 
in formulas and how you can sometimes use them to your advantage.
Chapters 3 through 6 concentrate on how to use different types of built-in 
functions. Chapter 3 covers the use of date and time functions, not only so 
you know what day and time it is, but actually put this knowledge to good 
use in formulas that calculate elapsed time. Chapter 4 takes up the financial 
functions in Excel and shows you how you can use them to both reveal and 
determine the monetary health of your business. Chapter 5 is concerned 
with math and statistical functions (of which there are plenty). Chapter 6 
introduces you to the powerful group of lookup, information, and text func-
tions. Here, you find out how to build formulas that automate data entry 
by returning values from a lookup table, get the lowdown on any cell in the 
worksheet, and combine your favorite pieces of text.
Book IV: Worksheet Collaboration and Review
Book IV looks at the ways you can share your spreadsheet data with others. 
Chapter 1 covers the important issue of security in your spreadsheets. Here, 
you find out how you can protect your data so that only those to whom you 
give permission can open or make changes to their contents.

5
How This Book Is Organized
Chapter 2 takes up the subject of building and using hyperlinks in your Excel 
spreadsheets (the same kind of links that you know and love on Web pages 
on the World Wide Web). This chapter covers how to create hyperlinks for 
moving from worksheet to worksheet within the same Excel file as well as 
for opening other documents on your hard disk, or logging onto the Internet 
and browsing to a favorite Web page.
Chapter 3 introduces Excel’s sophisticated features for sending out spread-
sheets and having a team of people review and make comments on them. It 
also covers techniques for reviewing and reconciling the suggested changes.
Chapter 4 is concerned with sharing spreadsheet data with other programs 
that you use. It looks specifically at how you can share data with other Office 
2010 programs such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook. This chap-
ter also discusses the role of Smart Tags in enabling you to automatically 
bring information into your spreadsheets from outside sources such as your 
Outlook Address Book and special Web sites on the Internet, how to save 
Excel files in a bunch of other easily-accessed file formats (PDF, XPS, and 
HTML), and how to publish them to shared spaces.
Book V: Charts and Graphics
Book V focuses on the graphical aspects of Excel. Chapter 1 covers charting 
your spreadsheet data in some depth. Here, you find out not only how to 
create great looking charts but also how to select the right type of chart for 
the data that you’re representing graphically.
Chapter 2 introduces you to all the other kinds of graphics that you can have 
in your spreadsheets. These include graphic objects that you draw as well 
as graphic images that you import, including clip art included in Microsoft 
Office as well as digital pictures and images imported and created with other 
hardware and software connected to your computer.
Book VI: Data Management
Book VI is concerned with the ins and outs of using Excel to maintain large 
amounts of data in what are known as databases or, more commonly, data 
lists. Chapter 1 gives you basic information on how to set up a data list and 
add your data to it. This chapter also gives you information on how to re-
organize the data list through sorting and how to total its numerical data 
with the Subtotal feature.
Chapter 2 is all about how to filter the data and extract just the informa-
tion you want out of it (a process officially known as querying the data). 
Here, you find out how to perform all sorts of filtering operations from the 
simplest, relying upon the AutoFilter feature, to the more complex that use 
custom filters and specialized database functions. Finally, you find out how 
to perform queries on external data sources such as those maintained with 

6
Conventions Used in This Book
dedicated database management software for Windows such as Microsoft 
Access or dBASE as well as those that run on other operating systems such 
as DB2 and Oracle.
Book VII: Data Analysis
Book VII looks at the subject of data analysis with Excel; essentially how to 
use the program’s computational abilities to project and predict possible 
future outcomes. Chapter 1 looks at the various ways to perform what-if sce-
narios in Excel. These include analyses with one- and two-input variable data 
tables, doing goal seeking, setting a series of different possible scenarios, 
and using the Solver add-in.
Chapter 2 is concerned with the topic of creating special data summaries 
called pivot tables that enable you to analyze large amounts of data in an 
extremely compact and modifiable format. Here, you find out how to create 
and manipulate pivot tables as well as build pivot charts that depict the 
summary information graphically.
Book VIII: Excel and VBA
Book VIII introduces the subject of customizing Excel through the use of its 
programming language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA for short). 
Chapter 1 introduces you to the use of the macro recorder to record tasks 
that you routinely perform in Excel for later automated playback. When you 
use the macro recorder to record the sequence of routine actions (using the 
program’s familiar menus, toolbars, and dialog boxes), Excel automatically 
records the sequence in the VBA programming language.
Chapter 2 introduces you to editing VBA code in Excel’s programming editor 
known as the Visual Basic Editor. Here, you find out how to use the Visual 
Basic Editor to edit macros that you’ve recorded that need slight modifica-
tions as well as how to write new macros from scratch. You also find out 
how to use the Visual Basic Editor to write custom functions that perform 
just the calculations you need in your Excel spreadsheets.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book follows a number of different conventions modeled primarily 
after those used by Microsoft in its various online articles and help materi-
als. These conventions deal primarily with Ribbon command sequences and 
shortcut or hot key sequences that you encounter.
Excel 2010 is a sophisticated program that uses the Ribbon interface first 
introduced in Excel 2007. In Chapter 1, I explain all about this new Ribbon 
interface and how to get comfortable with its new command structure. 
Throughout the book, you’ll find Ribbon command sequences using the 

7
Conventions Used in This Book
shorthand developed by Microsoft whereby the name on the tab on the 
Ribbon and the command button you select are separated by arrows, as in
Home➪Copy
This is shorthand for the Ribbon command that copies whatever cells or 
graphics are currently selected to the Windows Clipboard. It means that you 
click the Home tab on the Ribbon (if it’s not already displayed) and then 
click the Copy button (that sports the traditional side-by-side page icon).
Some of the Ribbon command sequences involve not only selecting a com-
mand button on a tab but then also selecting an item on a drop-down menu. 
In this case, the drop-down menu command follows the name of the tab and 
command button, all separated by vertical bars, as in
Formulas➪Calculation Options➪Manual
This is shorthand for the Ribbon command sequence that turns on manual 
recalculation in Excel. It says that you click the Formulas tab (if it’s not 
already displayed) and then click the Calculation Options command button 
followed by the Manual drop-down menu option.
Although you use the mouse and keyboard shortcut keys to move your way 
in, out, and around the Excel worksheet, you do have to take some time to 
enter the data so that you can eventually mouse around with it. Therefore, 
this book occasionally encourages you to type something specific into a 
specific cell in the worksheet. Of course, you can always choose not to 
follow the instructions. When I tell you to enter a specific function, the part 
you should type generally appears in bold type. For example, =SUM(A2:B2) 
means that you should type exactly what you see: an equal sign, the word 
SUM, a left parenthesis, the text A2:B2 (complete with a colon between the 
letter-number combos), and a right parenthesis. You then, of course, have to 
press Enter to make the entry stick.
When Excel isn’t talking to you by popping up message boxes, it displays 
highly informative messages in the Status bar at the bottom of the screen. 
This book renders messages that you see on-screen like this:
Calculate
This is the message that tells you that Excel is in manual recalculation mode 
(after using the earlier Ribbon command sequence) and that one or more 
of the formulas in your worksheet are not up-to-date and are in sore need of 
recalculation.
Occasionally I give you a hot key combination that you can press in order to 
choose a command from the keyboard rather than clicking buttons on the 
Ribbon with the mouse. Hot key combinations are written like this: Alt+FS or 
Ctrl+S (both of these hot key combos save workbook changes).

8
Icons Used in This Book
With the Alt key combos, you press the Alt key until the hot key letters 
appear in little squares all along the Ribbon. At that point, you can release 
the Alt key and start typing the hot key letters (by the way, you type all 
lowercase hot key letters — I only put them in caps to make them stand out 
in the text).
Hot key combos that use the Ctrl key are of an older vintage and they work 
a little bit differently as you have to hold down the Ctrl key as you type the 
hot key letter (though again, type only lowercase letters unless you see the 
Shift key in the sequence as in Ctrl+Shift+C).
Finally, if you’re really observant, you may notice a discrepancy between the 
capitalization of the names of dialog box options (such as headings, option 
buttons, and check boxes) as they appear in the book and how they actually 
appear in Excel on your computer screen. I intentionally use the convention 
of capitalizing the initial letters of all the main words of a dialog box option 
to help you differentiate the name of the option from the rest of the text 
describing its use.
Icons Used in This Book
The following icons are strategically placed in the margins throughout all 
eight books in this volume. Their purpose is to get your attention, and each 
has its own way of doing that.
 
This icon denotes some really cool information (in my humble opinion) that 
will pay off by making your work a lot more enjoyable or productive (or 
both).
 
This icon denotes a tidbit that you ought to pay extra attention to; other-
wise, you may end up taking a detour that wastes valuable time.
 
This icon denotes a tidbit that you ought to pay extra attention to; other-
wise, you’ll be sorry. I reserve this icon for those times when you can lose 
data and otherwise screw up your spreadsheet.
 
This icon denotes a tidbit that makes free use of (oh no!) technical jargon. 
You may want to skip these sections (or, at least, read them when no one 
else is around).

Where to Go from Here
Where to Go from Here
The question of where to go from here couldn’t be simpler — why, off to 
read the great Rich Tennant cartoons, of course! Then, go to Chapter 1 and 
find out what you’re dealing with. And, if you’re someone with some experi-
ence with earlier versions of Excel, I want you to head directly to the section, 
“Migrating to Excel 2010 from Earlier Versions Relying on Pull-Down Menus” 
in Chapter 1, where you find out how to stay calm as you become familiar 
and, yes, comfortable with the new Ribbon user interface.
Which book you go to after that is a matter of personal interest and need. 
Just go for the gold and don’t forget to have some fun while you’re digging!

✓ Quick start for users migrating from previous Excel versions relying on 
pull-down menus
E
xcel 2010 relies primarily on the on-screen element called the Ribbon, 
which is the means by which you select the vast majority of Excel com-
mands. A testament to this fact is that this latest version of Excel now mani-
fests the last vestiges of the old pull-down menu interface in the form of a 
menu options attached to the File Menu button in its brand-new Backstage 
View. In addition, the Excel 2010 interface sports only a single toolbar 
(the Quick Access toolbar) along with a handful of task panes (such as 
Clipboard, Clip Art, and Research). All this is a far cry from earlier versions 
like Excel 2003 with its 9 pull-down menus, more than 20 built-in toolbars, 
and 10 standard task panes.
The Excel 2010 user interface also includes all sorts of graphical improve-
ments. First and foremost is the Live Preview feature, which shows you how 
your actual worksheet data will appear in a particular font, table format-
ting, and so on before you actually apply it. In addition, Excel supports an 
honest-to-goodness Page Layout view that displays rulers and margins along 
with headers and footers for every worksheet. Page Layout view has a zoom 
slider at the bottom of the screen that enables you to zoom in and out on 
the spreadsheet data instantly. The brand-new Backstage View attached to 
the File menu enables you to get at-a-glance information about your spread-
sheet files as well as save, share, preview, and print them. Last but not least, 
Excel 2010 is full of pop-up galleries that make spreadsheet formatting and 
charting a real breeze, especially with the program’s Live Preview.

✦ File menu: When clicked, this button opens the new Backstage View 
containing a bunch of file-related options including Info, Save, Save As, 
Open, Close, Recent, New, Print, Share, and Exit as well as the Excel 
Options button that enables you to change Excel’s default settings.
 
✦ Quick Access toolbar: You can click the Save, Undo, and Redo buttons 
to perform common tasks to save your work and undo and redo editing 
changes. You can also click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button 

Book I

to the immediate right of the Redo button to open a drop-down menu 
containing additional common commands such New, Open, Quick Print, 
and so on, as well as to customize the toolbar, change its position, and 
minimize the Ribbon.
 
✦ Ribbon: Most Excel commands are contained in the Ribbon. They are 
arranged into a series of tabs ranging from Home through View.
 
✦ Formula bar: This displays the address of the current cell along with the 
contents of that cell.
 
✦ Worksheet area: This area contains all the cells of the current work-
sheet identified by column headings, using letters along the top, and row 
headings, using numbers along the left edge, with tabs for selecting new 
worksheets. You use a horizontal scroll bar on the bottom to move left 
and right through the sheet and a vertical scroll bar on the right edge to 
move up and down through the sheet.
 
✦ Status bar: This bar keeps you informed of the program’s current mode 
and any special keys you engage, and enables you to select a new work-
sheet view and to zoom in and out on the worksheet.
Going behind the scenes to Excel’s Backstage View
At the top of the Excel 2010 program window, immediately below the Excel 
program button and the Save button in the Quick Access toolbar, you find 
the File Menu button (the green, tab-like button named File).
When you click the File Menu button, the new Backstage View appears. The 
screen in this view contains a menu of file-related options running down a 
column on the left side and, depending upon which option is selected, some 
panels containing both at-a-glance information and further command options.
 
At first glance, the File Menu button may appear to you like a Ribbon tab — 
especially in light of its rectangular shape and location immediately left of 
the Ribbon’s initial Home tab. Keep in mind, however, that this important file 
control is technically a command button that, when clicked, leads directly to 
a totally new screen with the Backstage View. This screen has its own menu 
options, but contains no Ribbon command buttons whatsoever.
 
After you click the File Menu button to switch into Backstage View, you can 
then click this same button to return to the normal Worksheet View or you 
can simply press the Esc key.
Getting the lowdown on the Info panel
The first time you click the File Menu button, Excel selects the Info option 
below the four file-related menu options (Save, Save As, Open, and Close) at 
the top of the menu and the Info panel shown in Figure 1-2 appears.

On the left side of this Info panel, you find the following three command 
buttons:
 
✦ Protect Workbook to encrypt the Excel workbook file with a password, 
protect its contents, or verify the contents of the file with a digital signa-
ture (see Book IV, Chapters 1 and 3 for more on protecting and signing 
your workbooks)
 
✦ Check for Issues to inspect the document for hidden metadata (data 
about the file) and check the file’s accessibility for folks with disabilities 
and compatibility with earlier versions of Excel (see Book IV, Chapter 3 
for using this feature)
 
✦ Manage Versions to recover or delete draft versions saved with 
Excel’s AutoRecover feature (see Book II, Chapter 1 for more on using 
AutoRecover)
On the right side of the Info panel, you see a thumbnail containing a preview 
of the initial worksheet followed by a list of various and sundry bits of infor-
mation about the file:

✦ Properties lists the Size of the file as well as any Title, Tags, and 
Categories (to help identify the file when doing a search for the work-
book) assigned to it. To edit or add to this list of properties, click 
the Properties drop-down button and then select Edit Properties in 
Document, Advanced Properties, or Customize Properties on its drop-
down menu.
 
✦ Related Dates lists the date the file was Last Modified, Created, and 
Printed. To edit or add to this list of dates, click the Related Dates drop-
down button and then select Add a Related Date or Customize Dates on 
its drop-down menu.
 
✦ Related People lists the name of the workbook’s author as well as the 
name of the person who last modified the file. To edit or add to this list 
of people, click the Related People drop-down button and then select 
Add a Related Person or Customize People on its drop-down menu.
Sizing up the other Backstage View menu options
Immediately below the File Menu button at the very top of the menu you find 
the commands you commonly need for working with Excel workbook files, 
such as saving, opening, and closing files. (See Book II, Chapter 1 for more 
on saving and closing files and Book II, Chapter 3 for more on opening them.)
Below these file commands and the Info option, you find a Recent command 
option that, when selected, displays a panel listing all the Excel workbook files 
you’ve recently opened for editing. You can use this list to quickly reopen a 
workbook that needs further revision simply by double-clicking its name.
The Recent option is followed by a New command that, when selected, dis-
plays an Available Templates panel. This panel displays a list of all the avail-
able spreadsheet templates on the left side with a preview of the layout of 
the currently selected template on the right side. (See Book II, Chapter 1 for 
more on creating and using workbook templates.)
Beneath the New command you find the Print option that, when selected, 
displays a Print Settings panel. This panel contains the document’s current 
print settings (that you can modify) on the left side and a preview area that 
shows you the pages of the printed worksheet report. (See Book II, Chapter 
5 for more on printing worksheets using the Print Settings panel in the 
Backstage View.)
Below the Print command you find the Share option, which, when selected, 
displays a Send panel. This panel contains a list of commands used to share 
workbook files including e-mailing them, faxing them, converting them to 
other more usable file types, and saving them to the company’s SharePoint 
Web site. (See Book IV, Chapter 4 for more about e-mailing workbook files, 
converting them to other file formats, and publishing them online.)

18
Meet Excel’s Ribbon User Interface
Finally, at the bottom of the menu, you find the Options button, which you 
can select to change the program’s settings followed by an Exit button that 
you can select when you’re ready to shut down the program. (See Book I, 
Chapter 3 for more on customizing Excel 2010.)
Ripping through the Ribbon
The Ribbon (shown in Figure 1-3) radically changes the way you work in 
Excel 2010. You no longer need to memorize (or guess) which pull-down 
menu or toolbar contains the command you want to use. The designers and 
engineers at Microsoft came up with the Ribbon, which always shows you all 
the most commonly used options needed to perform a particular Excel task.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Excel’s

of a series 
of tabs 
containing 
command 
buttons 
arranged 
into different 
groups.

Minimize the Ribbon
The Ribbon is made up of the following components:
 
✦ Tabs: Excel’s main tasks are brought together and display all the com-
mands commonly needed to perform that core task.
 
✦ Groups: Related command buttons can be organized into subtasks nor-
mally performed as part of the tab’s larger core task.
 
✦ Command buttons: Within each group you find command buttons that 
you can select to perform a particular action or to open a gallery. Note 
that many command buttons on certain tabs of the Excel Ribbon are 
organized into mini-toolbars with related settings.
 
✦ Dialog Box launcher: This button is located in the lower-right corner of 
certain groups and opens a dialog box containing a bunch of additional 
options you can select.
To get more of the Worksheet area displayed in the program window, you 
can minimize the Ribbon so that only its tabs are displayed. You can mini-
mize the Ribbon by doing any of the following:

Book I
Chapter 1
The Excel 2010 
User Experience
19
Meet Excel’s Ribbon User Interface
 
✦ Click the Minimize the Ribbon button (the first button with the caret 
symbol in the bank of buttons to the right, opposite the last Ribbon tab).
 
✦ Double-click a Ribbon tab.
 
✦ Press Ctrl+F1.
 
To redisplay the entire Ribbon and keep all the command buttons on its tab 
displayed in the program window, click the Minimize the Ribbon button, 
double-click one of the tabs, or press Ctrl+F1 a second time.
When you work in Excel with the Ribbon minimized, the Ribbon expands 
each time you click one of its tabs to show its command buttons, but that 
tab stays open only until you select one of its command buttons. The 
moment you select a command button, Excel immediately minimizes the 
Ribbon again so that only the tabs display.
Keeping tabs on the Excel Ribbon
The very first time you launch Excel 2010, its Ribbon contains the following 
seven tabs, proceeding from left to right:
 
✦ Home: Use this tab when creating, formatting, and editing a spread-
sheet. This tab is arranged into the Clipboard, Font, Alignment, Number, 
Styles, Cells, and Editing groups.
 
✦ Insert: Use this when adding particular elements (including graphics, 
PivotTables, charts, hyperlinks, and headers and footers) to a spread-
sheet. This tab is arranged into the Tables, Illustrations, Sparklines, 
Filter, Charts, Links, and Text groups.
 
✦ Page Layout: Use this tab when preparing a spreadsheet for printing or 
reordering graphics on the sheet. This tab is arranged into the Themes, 
Page Setup, Scale to Fit, Sheet Options, and Arrange groups.
 
✦ Formulas: Use this tab when adding formulas and functions to a spread-
sheet or checking a worksheet for formula errors. This tab is arranged 
into the Function Library, Defined Names, Formula Auditing, and 
Calculation groups. Note that this tab also contains a Solutions group 
when you activate certain add-in programs, such as Conditional Sum and 
Euro Currency Tools — see Book I, Chapter 3 for more on Excel add-ins.
 
✦ Data: Use this tab when importing, querying, outlining, and subtotaling 
the data placed into a worksheet’s data list. This tab is arranged into the 
Get External Data, Connections, Sort & Filter, Data Tools, and Outline 
groups. Note that this tab also contains an Analysis group if you activate 
add-ins, such as the Analysis Toolpak and Solver Add-In — see Book I, 
Chapter 3 for more on Excel add-ins.
 
✦ Review: Use this tab when proofing, protecting, and marking up 
a spreadsheet for review by others. This tab is arranged into the 
Proofing, Language, Comments, and Changes groups. Note that this 

20
Meet Excel’s Ribbon User Interface
tab also contains an Ink group with a sole Start Inking button if you’re 
running Office 2010 on a Tablet PC or on a computer equipped with 
some sort of electronic input tablet.
 
✦ View: Use this tab when changing the display of the Worksheet area 
and the data it contains. This tab is arranged into the Workbook Views, 
Show, Zoom, Window, and Macros groups.
Although these seven tabs are the standard ones on the Ribbon, they are not 
the only tools that can appear in this area. Excel can display contextual tools 
when you’re working with a particular object that you select in the work-
sheet, such as a graphic image you’ve added or a chart or PivotTable you’ve 
created. The name of the contextual tools for the selected object appears 
immediately above the tab or tabs associated with the tools.
For example, Figure 1-4 shows a worksheet immediately after I selected the 
embedded chart. As you can see, doing this causes the contextual tool called 
Chart Tools to be added to the very end of the Ribbon. Chart Tools has its 
own three tabs: Design (selected by default), Layout, and Format. Note too 
that the command buttons on the Design tab are arranged into groups: Type, 
Data, Chart Layouts, Chart Styles, and Location.

The moment you deselect the object (usually by clicking somewhere on the 
sheet outside of its boundaries), the contextual tool for that object and all 
of its tabs immediately disappears from the Ribbon, leaving only the regular 
tabs — Home, Insert, Page Layout, Formulas, Data, Review, and View — 
displayed.
Adding the Developer tab to the Ribbon
If you do a lot of work with macros (see Book VIII, Chapter 1) and XML files 
in Excel, you should add the Developer tab to the Ribbon. This tab contains 
all the command buttons normally needed to create, play, and edit macros 
as well as to import and map XML files. To add the Developer tab to the 
Excel Ribbon, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File Menu button to get into Backstage View.
 
2. Click the Options button at the bottom of the command menu to open 
the Excel Options dialog box.
 
3. Click the Customize Ribbon option in the Excel Options dialog box 
and then click the Developer check box under Main Tabs in the 
Customize the Ribbon list box on the right. Click OK.
Selecting commands on the Ribbon
The most direct method for selecting commands on the Ribbon is to click 
the tab that contains the command button you want and then click that 
button in its group. For example, to insert a piece of Clip Art into your 
spreadsheet, you click the Insert tab and then click the Clip Art button to 
open the Clip Art Task pane in the Worksheet area.
The easiest method for selecting commands on the Ribbon — if you know 
your keyboard at all well — is to press the Alt key and then type the letter of 
the hot key that appears on the tab you want to select. Excel then displays 
all the command button hot keys next to their buttons, along with the hot 
keys for the dialog box launchers in any group on that tab (see Figure 1-5). 
To select a command button or dialog box launcher, simply type its hot key 
letter.
If you know the old Excel shortcut keys from versions prior to Excel 2007, 
you can still use them. For example, instead of going through the rigmarole 
of pressing Alt+HC to copy a cell selection to the Windows Clipboard and 
then Alt+HV to paste it elsewhere in the sheet, you can still press Ctrl+C to 
copy the selection and then press Ctrl+V when you’re ready to paste it. Note, 
however, that when using a hot key combination with the Alt key, you don’t 
need to keep the Alt key pressed while typing the remaining letter(s) as you 
do when using a hot key combo with the Ctrl key.

Adjusting to the Quick Access toolbar
When you first begin using Excel 2010, the Quick Access toolbar contains 
only the following three buttons:
 
✦ Save: Saves any changes made to the current workbook using the same 
filename, file format, and location.
 
✦ Undo: Undoes the last editing, formatting, or layout change you made.
 
✦ Redo: Reapplies the previous editing, formatting, or layout change that 
you just removed with the Undo button.
The Quick Access toolbar is very customizable because you can easily add 
any Ribbon command to it. Moreover, you’re not restricted to adding but-
tons for just the commands on the Ribbon; you can add any Excel command 
you want to the toolbar, even the obscure ones that don’t rate an appear-
ance on any of its tabs. (See Book I, Chapter 3 for details on customizing the 
Quick Access toolbar.)
By default, the Quick Access toolbar appears right above the File Menu 
button and Ribbon tabs. To display the toolbar beneath the Ribbon above 
the Formula bar, click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button (the 
drop-down button to the direct right of the toolbar with a horizontal bar 
above a down-pointing triangle) and then click Show Below the Ribbon on its 
drop-down menu. Doing this helps you avoid crowding out the name of the 
current workbook that appears to the toolbar’s right.
Fooling around with the Formula bar
The Formula bar displays the cell address and the contents of the current 
cell. The address of this cell is determined by its column letter(s) followed 
immediately by the row number, as in cell A1, the very first cell of each 
worksheet at the intersection of column A and row 1, or cell XFD1048576, the 

Book I
Chapter 1
The Excel 2010 
User Experience
23
Meet Excel’s Ribbon User Interface
very last of each Excel 2010 worksheet at the intersection of column XFD and 
row 1048576. The contents of the current cell are determined by the type of 
entry you make there: text or numbers, if you just enter a heading or particu-
lar value, and the nuts and bolts of a formula, if you enter a calculation there.
The Formula bar is divided into three sections:
 
✦ Name box: The left-most section displays the address of the current cell 
address.
 
✦ Formula bar buttons: The second, middle section appears as a rather 
nondescript button displaying only an indented circle on the left (used 
to narrow or widen the Name box) with the Insert Function button 
(labeled fx) on the right until you start making or editing a cell entry. At 
that time, its Cancel (an X) and its Enter (a check mark) buttons appear 
in between them.
 
✦ Cell contents: The third white area to the immediate right of the 
Function Wizard button takes up the rest of the bar and expands as 
necessary to display really, really long cell entries that won’t fit in the 
normal area.
The Cell contents section of the Formula bar is really important because it 
always shows you the contents of the cell even when the worksheet does 
not. (When you’re dealing with a formula, Excel displays only the calculated 
result in the cell in the worksheet and not the formula by which that result 
is derived.) You can edit the contents of the cell in this area at any time. By 
the same token, when the Cell contents area is blank, you know that the cell 
is empty as well.
What’s up with the Worksheet area?
The Worksheet area is where most of the Excel spreadsheet action takes 
place because it displays the cells in different sections of the current work-
sheet. Also, inside the cells is where you do all of your spreadsheet data 
entry and formatting, not to mention the majority of your editing.
When it comes to labeling the 16,384 columns 
of an Excel 2010 worksheet, our alphabet with 
its measly 26 letters is simply not up to the 
task. To make up the difference, Excel first 
doubles the letters in the cell’s column refer-
ence so that column AA follows column Z (after 
which you find column AB, AC, and so on) and 
then triples them so that column AAA follows 
column ZZ (after which you get column AAB, 
AAC, and the like). At the end of this letter 
tripling, the 16,384th and last column of the 
worksheet ends up being XFD, so that the last 
cell in the 1,048,576th row has the cell address 
XFD1048576.
Assigning 26 letters to 16,384 columns

24
Meet Excel’s Ribbon User Interface
Keep in mind that for you to be able to enter or edit data in a cell, that cell 
must be current. Excel indicates that a cell is current in three ways:
 
✦ The cell cursor — the dark black border surrounding the cell’s entire 
perimeter — appears in the cell.
 
✦ The address of the cell appears in the Name box of the Formula bar.
 
✦ The current cell’s column letter(s) and row number are shaded (in an 
orange color on most monitors) in the column headings and row head-
ings that appear at the top and left of the Worksheet area, respectively.
Moving around the worksheet
Each Excel worksheet contains far too many columns and rows for all of its 
cells to be displayed at one time. (It’s true: 17,179,869,184 cell totals equal 
an illegible black blob, regardless of the size of your monitor.) Excel offers 
many methods for moving the cell cursor around the worksheet to the cell 
where you want to enter new data or edit existing data:
 
✦ Click the desired cell — assuming that the cell is displayed within the 
section of the sheet currently visible in the Worksheet area.
 
✦ Click the Name box, type the address of the desired cell directly into 
this box, and then press the Enter key.
 
✦ Press Ctrl+G or F5 to open the Go To dialog box, type the address of the 
desired cell into its Reference text box, and then click OK.
 
✦ Use the cursor keys, as shown in Table 1-1, to move the cell cursor to 
the desired cell.
 
✦ Use the horizontal and vertical scroll bars at the bottom and right edges 
of the Worksheet area to move the part of the worksheet that contains 
the desired cell, and then click the cell to put the cell cursor in it.
Keystroke shortcuts for moving the cell cursor
Excel offers a wide variety of keystrokes for moving the cell cursor to a 
new cell. When you use one of these keystrokes, the program automatically 
scrolls a new part of the worksheet into view, if this is required to move the 
cell pointer. In Table 1-1, I summarize these keystrokes and how far each one 
moves the cell cursor from its starting position.

the pointer goes to the cell at the very end of the row.
Ctrl+← or End, ←
First occupied cell to the left in the same row that is either 
preceded or followed by a blank cell. If no cell is occupied, 
the pointer goes to the cell at the very beginning of the row.
Ctrl+↑ or End, ↑
First occupied cell above in the same column that is either 
preceded or followed by a blank cell. If no cell is occupied, 
the pointer goes to the cell at the very top of the column.
Ctrl+↓ or End, ↓
First occupied cell below in the same column that is either 
preceded or followed by a blank cell. If no cell is occupied, 
the pointer goes to the cell at the very bottom of the column.
Ctrl+Page Down
Last occupied cell in the next worksheet of that workbook.
Ctrl+Page Up
Last occupied cell in the previous worksheet of that 
workbook.
Note: In the case of those keystrokes that use arrow keys, you must either use the arrows on the 
cursor keypad or have the Num Lock key disengaged on the numeric keypad of your keyboard.
The keystrokes that combine the Ctrl or End key with an arrow key (listed in 
Table 1-1) are among the most helpful for moving quickly from one edge to 
the other in large tables of cell entries. Moving from table to table in a sec-
tion of the worksheet that contains many blocks of cells is also much easier.
When you use Ctrl and an arrow key to move from edge to edge in a table or 
between tables in a worksheet, you hold down Ctrl while you press one of the 
four arrow keys (indicated by the + symbol in keystrokes, such as Ctrl+→).
When you use End and an arrow-key alternative, you must press and then 
release the End key before you press the arrow key (indicated by the comma 
in keystrokes, such as End, →). Pressing and releasing the End key causes 
the END indicator to appear onscreen in the Status bar. This is your sign 
that Excel is ready for you to press one of the four arrow keys.

26
Meet Excel’s Ribbon User Interface
Because you can keep the Ctrl key depressed as you press the different 
arrow keys that you need to use, the Ctrl-plus-arrow-key method provides a 
more fluid method for navigating blocks of cells than the End-then-arrow-key 
method.
You can use the Scroll Lock key to “freeze” the position of the cell pointer in 
the worksheet so that you can scroll new areas of the worksheet in view with 
keystrokes such as PgUp (Page Up) and PgDn (Page Down) without chang-
ing the cell pointer’s original position (in essence, making these keystrokes 
work in the same manner as the scroll bars).
After engaging Scroll Lock, when you scroll the worksheet with the key-
board, Excel does not select a new cell while it brings a new section of the 
worksheet into view. To “unfreeze” the cell pointer when scrolling the work-
sheet via the keyboard, you just press the Scroll Lock key again.
Tips on using the scroll bars
To understand how scrolling works in Excel, imagine the worksheet is a 
humongous papyrus scroll attached to rollers on the left and right. To bring 
into view a new section of a papyrus worksheet that is hidden on the right, 
you crank the left roller until the section with the cells that you want to see 
appears. Likewise, to scroll into view a new section of the worksheet that is 
hidden on the left, you crank the right roller until that section of cells appears.
You can use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the Worksheet area to 
scroll back and forth through the columns of a worksheet. Likewise, you can 
use the vertical scroll bar to scroll up and down through its rows. To scroll 
one column or a row at a time in a particular direction, click the appropri-
ate scroll arrow at the ends of the scroll bar. To jump immediately back to 
the originally displayed area of the worksheet after scrolling through single 
columns or rows in this fashion, simply click the black area in the scroll bar 
that now appears in front of or after the scroll bar.
You can resize the horizontal scroll bar, making it wider or narrower, by 
dragging the button that appears to the immediate left of its left scroll arrow. 
When working in a workbook that contains a whole bunch of worksheets, in 
widening the horizontal scroll bar, you can end up hiding the display of the 
workbook’s later sheet tabs.
To scroll very quickly through columns or rows of the worksheet, hold down 
the Shift key and then drag the mouse pointer in the appropriate direction 
within the scroll bar until the columns or rows that you want to see appear 
on the screen in the Worksheet area. When you hold down the Shift key as 
you scroll, the scroll button within the scroll bar becomes really narrow, 
and a ScreenTip appears next to the scroll bar, keeping you informed of the 
letter(s) of the columns or the numbers of the rows that you’re currently 
whizzing through.

Book I
Chapter 1
The Excel 2010

27
Meet Excel’s Ribbon User Interface
If your mouse has a wheel, you can use it to scroll directly through the 
columns and rows of the worksheet without using the horizontal or verti-
cal scroll bars. Simply position the white-cross mouse pointer in the center 
of the Worksheet area and then hold down the wheel button of the mouse. 
When the mouse pointer changes to a four-point arrow, drag the mouse 
pointer in the appropriate direction (left and right to scroll through columns 
or up and down to scroll through rows) until the desired column or row 
comes into view in the Worksheet area.
The only disadvantage to using the scroll bars to move around is that the 
scroll bars bring only new sections of the worksheet into view — they don’t 
actually change the position of the cell cursor. If you want to start making 
entries in the cells in a new area of the worksheet, you still have to remember 
to select the cell (by clicking it) or the group of cells (by dragging through 
them) where you want the data to appear before you begin entering the data.
Surfing the sheets in a workbook
Each new workbook you open in Excel 2010 contains three blank work-
sheets, each with its own 16,384 columns and 1,048,576 rows (giving you a 
truly staggering total of 51,539,607,552 blank cells!). But that’s not all: If ever 
you need more worksheets in your workbook, you can add them simply by 
clicking the Insert Worksheet button that appears to the immediate right of 
the last sheet tab (see Figure 1-6).
On the left side of the bottom of the Worksheet area, the Sheet tab scroll 
buttons appear followed by the actual tabs for the worksheets in your work-
book and the Insert Worksheet button. To activate a worksheet for editing, 
you select it by clicking its sheet tab. Excel lets you know what sheet is 
active by displaying the sheet name on its tab in boldface type and making 
its tab appear to be on top of the others.
You may wonder why on earth anyone would 
ever need more than three worksheets given 
just how many cells each individual sheet con-
tains. The simple truth is that it’s all about how 
you choose to structure a particular spread-
sheet rather than running out of places to put 
the data. For example, say you need to create 
a workbook that contains budgets for all the 
various departments in your corporation; you 
may decide to devote an individual worksheet 
to each department (with the actual budget 
spreadsheet tables laid out in the same manner 
on each sheet) rather than placing all the tables 
in different sections of the same sheet. Using 
this kind of one-sheet-per-budget layout makes 
it much easier for you to find each budget, print 
each one as a separate page of a report, and, 
if ever necessary, consolidate their data in a 
separate summary worksheet.

extra sheets to a workbook

If your workbook contains too many sheets for all their tabs to be displayed 
at the bottom of the Worksheet area, use the Sheet tab scroll buttons to 
bring new tabs into view (so that you can then click them to activate them). 
You click the Next Sheet button to scroll the next hidden sheet tab into view 
or the Last Sheet button to scroll the last group of completely or partially 
hidden tabs into view.
Taking a tour of the Status bar
The Status bar is the last component at the very bottom of the Excel pro-
gram window (see Figure 1-7). The Status bar contains the following areas:

(Ready, Edit, and so on) as well as any special keys that are engaged 
(Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock).
 
✦ Macro Recording: This button (the red dot on a tiny worksheet) appears 
only after you add the Developer tab to the Ribbon (see “Adding the 
Developer tab to the Ribbon” earlier in this chapter for details). Click it to 
open the Record Macro dialog box, where you can set the parameters for 
a new macro and begin recording it (see Book VIII, Chapter 1).

✦ AutoCalculate: This indicator displays the Average and Sum of all the 
numerical entries in the current cell selection along with the Count of 
every cell in the selection.
 
✦ Layout: This selector enables you to select between three layouts for the 
Worksheet area: Normal, the default view that shows only the worksheet 
cells with the column and row headings; Page Layout View, which adds 
rulers and page margins and shows page breaks for the worksheet; and 
Page Break Preview, which enables you to adjust the paging of a report.
 
✦ Zoom: The Zoom slider enables you to zoom in and out on the cells in the 
Worksheet area by dragging the slider to the right or left, respectively.
The Num Lock indicator tells you that you can use the numbers on the numeric 
keypad for entering values in the worksheet. This keypad is often separate on 
the right side of a stand-alone keyboard connected to a desktop computer, and 
embedded into the regular typing keys on almost all laptop computers.
Launching and Quitting Excel
Excel 2010 runs under both the older Windows XP operating system and the 
newer Windows 7 and Vista operating systems. Because of changes made to 
the Start menu in Windows 7 and Vista, the procedure for starting Excel from 
these versions of Windows is a bit different from Windows XP.
Starting Excel from the Windows 7 
and Vista Start menu
You can use the Start Search box at the bottom of the Windows Vista Start menu 
to locate Excel on your computer and launch the program in no time at all:
 
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar to open the Windows 
Start menu.
 
2. Click the Search Programs and Files text box (called Start Search in 
Vista) and type the two letters ex to have Windows locate Microsoft 
Office Excel 2010 on your computer.
 
3. Click the Microsoft Office Excel 2010 option that now appears under 
Programs near the top of the Start menu.
If you have more time on your hands, you can also launch Excel from the 
Windows Start menu by going through the rigmarole of clicking Start➪All 
Programs➪Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office Excel 2010.
Starting Excel from the Windows XP Start menu
When starting Excel 2010 from the Windows XP Start menu, you follow these 
simple steps:

30
Launching and Quitting Excel
 
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar to open the Windows 
Start menu.
 
2. With the mouse, highlight All Programs on the Start menu and then 
click Microsoft Office on the Start continuation menu before choosing 
Microsoft Office Excel 2010 from the Microsoft Office continuation menu.
Pinning Excel to the Start menu
If you use Excel all the time, you may want to make its program option a per-
manent part of the Windows Start menu. To do this, pin the program option 
to the Start menu:
 
1. Start Excel from the Windows Start menu.
 
 In launching Excel, use the appropriate method for your version of 
Windows as I outline earlier in this chapter.
 
 After launching Excel, Windows adds Microsoft Office 2010 to the 
recently used portion on the left side of the Windows Start menu.
 
2. Click the Start menu and then right-click Microsoft Office Excel 2010 
to open its shortcut menu.
 
3. Click Pin to Start menu on the shortcut menu.
After pinning Excel in this manner, the Microsoft Office Excel 2010 option 
always appears in the upper section of the left-hand column of the Start 
menu. You can now launch Excel simply by clicking the Start button and 
then clicking this option.
Pinning Excel to the Windows 7 Taskbar
If your computer runs Windows 7, you can add a Microsoft Excel 2010 icon 
to the standard Internet Explorer, Windows Explorer, and Windows Media 
Player buttons on its taskbar.
To do this, drag the Microsoft Excel 2010 icon that you’ve either pinned to the 
Windows Start menu (see “Pinning Excel to Start menu,” which immediately 
precedes this section) or that you’ve added as a shortcut to the Windows 
desktop (see the sections on adding an Excel shortcut to your Windows desk-
top for Windows 7, Vista, or XP that immediately follow this section for details) 
and drag and drop it into its desired position on the Windows 7 taskbar.
 
After you pin a Microsoft Excel 2010 icon to the Windows 7 Taskbar, the 
button appears on the Windows taskbar each time you start your computer, 
and you can launch the Excel program simply by single-clicking its Quick 
Launch button.

Adding an Excel shortcut to the 
Windows 7 or Vista desktop
Some people prefer having the Excel Program icon appear on the Windows 
desktop so that they can simply double-click the program icon to launch Excel. 
To create an Excel program shortcut for Windows Vista, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Start button on the Windows 7 or Vista taskbar.
 
 The Start menu opens.
 
2. Click the Start Search text box on the Start menu and type excel.exe.
 
 Excel.exe is the name of the executable program file that runs Excel. 
After finding this file on your hard drive, you can create a desktop short-
cut from it that launches the program.
 
3. Right-click the file icon for the excel.exe file at the top of the Start 
menu and then highlight Send To on the pop-up menu and click 
Desktop (Create Shortcut) on its continuation menu.
 
 A shortcut named Microsoft Excel 2010 appears on your Windows desktop.
Adding an Excel shortcut to 
the Windows XP desktop
If you’re running Excel 2010 on Windows XP, use the following steps to 
create a program shortcut for your desktop:
 
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar.
 
 The Start menu opens the Search item.
 
2. Click Search in the lower-right corner of the Start menu.
 
 The Search Results dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the All Files and Folders link in the panel on the left side of the 
Search Results dialog box.
 
 The Search Companion pane appears on the left side of the Search 
Results dialog box.
 
4. Type excel.exe in the All or Part of the File Name text box.
 
 Excel.exe is the name of the executable program file that runs Excel. 
After finding this file on your hard drive, you can create a desktop short-
cut from it that launches the program.
 
5. Click the Search button.
 
 Windows now searches your hard disk for the Excel program file. After 
this file is found, its name appears on the right side of the Search Results 
dialog box. When this filename appears, you can click the Stop button in 
the left panel to halt the search.

6. Right-click the file icon for the excel.exe file and then highlight Send 
To on the pop-up menu and click Desktop (Create Shortcut) on its con-
tinuation menu.
 
 A shortcut named Shortcut to excel.exe appears on your desktop.
 
7. Click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the Search Results 
dialog box.
 
 After closing the Search Results dialog box, you should see the icon 
named Shortcut to excel.exe on the desktop. You should probably 
rename the shortcut to something a little friendlier, such as Excel 2010.
 
8. Right-click the Shortcut to excel.exe icon and then click Rename on 
the pop-up menu.
 
9. Replace the current name by typing a new shortcut name, such as 
Excel 2010, and then click anywhere on the desktop.
After creating an Excel desktop shortcut on the Windows XP desktop, from 
then on, you can launch Excel by double-clicking the shortcut icon.
When it’s quitting time
When you’re ready to call it a day and quit Excel, you have several choices 
for shutting down the program:
 
✦ Click the File Menu button followed by the Exit option.
 
✦ Press Alt+FX or Alt+F4.
 
✦ Click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the Excel program 
window.
If you try to exit Excel after working on a workbook and you haven’t saved 
your latest changes, the program beeps at you and displays an alert box 
querying whether you want to save your changes. To save your changes 
before exiting, click the Yes command button. (For detailed information on 
saving documents, see Book I, Chapter 2.) If you’ve just been playing around 
in the worksheet and don’t want to save your changes, you can abandon the 
document by clicking the No button.
Migrating to Excel 2010 from Earlier Versions 
Relying on Pull-Down Menus
If you’re a brand-new Excel user, you’re going to take to the program’s new 
Ribbon user interface like a duck to water. However, if you’re coming to 
Excel 2010 as a dedicated user of any of the earlier Excel versions that rely 
on the pull-down menus and multiple taskbars (from Excel 97 all the way 
through Excel 2003), the first time you launch Excel 2010 and take a gander 

Book I
Chapter 1
The Excel 2010 
User Experience
33
Migrating to Excel 2010 from Earlier Versions Relying on Pull-Down Menus
at the new Ribbon, you’re probably going to feel more like someone just 
threw you into the deep end of the pool without a life preserver.
Don’t panic! Simply use this section of the chapter as your Excel 2010 floata-
tion device. It’s intended to get you oriented, keep your head above water, 
and have you swimming with the new interface in no time at all. Just give me 
five minutes of your precious time and I promise I’ll have you up and running 
with Excel 2010 and maybe even smiling again.
First, the bad news: There is no Classic mode in Excel 2010 that will magi-
cally turn that hefty, screen real estate-stealing Ribbon back into those sleek 
and tried-and-true pull-down menus (thanks Microsoft, I needed that)! After 
the wonderful designers and engineers at Microsoft got through dumping all 
the pull-down menus and toolbars that you worked so diligently to master, 
there was just nothing left for them to hang a Classic mode onto.
Now, for the good news: You really don’t need a Classic mode — you just 
need to find out where those scoundrel engineers placed all the stuff you 
used in the versions of Excel you used before the Ribbon user interface. 
After all, you already know what most of those pull-down menu items and 
toolbar buttons do; all you have to do is locate them.
Cutting the Ribbon down to size
The first step is to get that busy Ribbon out of your face. At this point, it’s 
just taking up valuable work space and probably making you crazy. So, 
please double-click any one of the tabs or press Ctrl+F1 right now to cut the 
Ribbon display down to only its tabs (single-clicking a tab temporarily redis-
plays the Ribbon until you select one of its command buttons, and pressing 
Ctrl+F1 immediately redisplays the Ribbon and keeps it open).
When only the tabs — Home through View — are showing at the top of the 
Excel program window, you should feel a whole lot more comfortable with 
the screen. The Excel 2010 screen is as clean and uncluttered as the earlier 
version of Excel that you were using, with only the Quick Access toolbar, 
Ribbon tabs, and Formula bar displayed above the Worksheet area.
Now, you’re probably wondering where those pesky Microsoft engineers 
moved the most important and commonly used pull-down menu commands. 
Table 1-2 shows the Excel 2010 equivalents for the menu commands you 
probably used most often in doing your work in the earlier versions of Excel.
When a particular command is assigned to one of the tabs on the Ribbon, 
Table 1-2 lists only the tab and command button name without naming the 
group because the group name plays no part in selecting the command. 
So, for example, the table lists the tab+command button equivalent of the 
View➪Header and View➪Footer command as Insert➪Header & Footer with-
out regard to the fact that the Header & Footer button is part of the Text 
group on the Insert tab.

For the most part, the pull-down menu commands listed in Table 1-2 are logi-

Footer PivotTable/PivotChart commands that are located on the Insert tab 
rather than the View tab and Data tab as might be expected, given that they 
inhabited, respectively, the View and Data pull-down menus in earlier Excel

versions. In addition, the worksheet background command ended up all by 
its lonesome on the Page Layout tab rather than going to the Home tab with 
all its fellow formatting commands.
Finding the Standard Toolbar buttons equivalents
If you’re like me, you have come to rely heavily on the buttons of the 
Standard toolbar for doing all sorts of everyday tasks in earlier versions of 
Excel. Table 1-3 shows you the Excel 2010 equivalents for the buttons on 
the Standard toolbar in Excel 2003. As you can see from this table, most of 
these Standard toolbar buttons are relegated to one of the following places 
in Excel 2010:
 
✦ Menu in Backstage View, which is activated by clicking the File Menu 
button or pressing Alt+F (New, Open, Save, and Print).
 
✦ Quick Access toolbar (Save, Undo, and Redo).
 
✦ Home tab in the Clipboard group (Cut, Copy, Paste, and Format Painter) 
and Editing group (AutoSum, Sort Ascending, and Sort Descending).

Because Excel 2010 supports the sole Quick Access toolbar, the Drawing

including using Clip Art, inserting graphics files, and creating diagrams and 
WordArt are now found on the Insert tab. Also, keep in mind that Excel 2010 
doesn’t have an equivalent to the ChartWizard button on the Standard tool-
bar because you can create a chart in a split second by clicking the Column, 
Line, Pie, Bar, Area, Scatter, or Other Charts command button on the Insert 
tab (see Book V, Chapter 1 for details).
Finding the Formatting Toolbar buttons equivalents
Finding the Excel 2010 equivalents for the buttons on the Formatting tool-
bar in earlier versions of Excel couldn’t be easier. Every one of the buttons 
on the Formatting toolbar is prominently displayed on the Home tab of the 
Excel 2010 Ribbon. They’re all easy to identify as they use the same icons 
as before and are located in the Font, Alignment, or Number group on the 
Home tab (refer to Figure 1-3).
In addition to the Font, Font Size, Bold, Italic, Underline, Borders, Fill Color, 
and Font Color buttons from the Formatting toolbar, the Font group also 
contains the following two buttons:
 
✦ Increase Font: Use this button to bump up the current font size a point.
 
✦ Decrease Font: Use this button to reduce the current font size by a point.
In addition to the Left Align, Center, Right Align, Decrease Indent, Increase 
Indent, and Merge and Center buttons, the Alignment group also contains 
the following buttons:
 
✦ Top Align: Click this button to vertically align the data entered into the 
current cell selection with the top edge of the cell.
 
✦ Middle Align: Use this button to vertically center the data entered into 
the current cell selection.
 
✦ Bottom Align: Click this button to align the data entered in the current 
cell selection with the bottom edge of the cell.
 
✦ Orientation: Use this button to open a pop-up menu of orientation 
options. You can change the direction of the text entered into the cur-
rent cell selection by angling it up or down, converting it to vertical 
text, rotating it up or down, as well as opening the Alignment tab of the 
Format Cells dialog box.
 
✦ Wrap Text: Click this button to apply the wrap text function to the cur-
rent cell selection so that Excel expands the row heights as needed to fit 
all of its text within the current column widths.
In addition to the Percent Style, Comma, Increase Decimal, and Decrease 
Decimal buttons from the Formatting toolbar, the Numbers group contains 
the following buttons:

✦ Accounting Number Format: This button enables you to select among 
several different currency formats from U.S. dollars to Swiss francs, as 
well as to open the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box with the 
Accounting number format selected.
 
✦ Number Format: This button opens a drop-down menu of differ-
ent number options from General through Text, as well as opens the 
Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box when you select its More 
Number Formats option.
Putting the Quick Access toolbar to its best use
Figures 1-8 and 1-9 show you the top of the Excel 2010 program window with 
the Ribbon minimized and a completely customized Quick Access toolbar 
that’s moved down so that it appears under the tabs and immediately above 
the Formula bar. Figure 1-8 shows you the left half of this customize Quick 
Access toolbar and Figure 1-9, the right half.

This completely custom version of the Quick Access toolbar should seem 
very familiar to you: It contains every button from the Standard and 
Formatting toolbars in Excel 2003 with the exception of the Permission, 
Zoom, and Help buttons in the original order in which they appear on their 
respective toolbars.
The Permission button is so esoteric and seldom used that I didn’t bother 
to add it, and neither the Zoom button nor the Help button is really needed. 
The Zoom slider that enables you to quickly select a new screen magnifica-
tion percentage is always displayed in the lower-right corner of the Excel 
2010 Status bar and the Help button is always displayed on the right side of 
the bar containing the Ribbon tabs.

To customize your Quick Access toolbar so that it matches the one shown in 
Figures 1-8 and 1-9 with every button from the Standard and Formatting tool-
bars except the Permission, Zoom, and Help buttons, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button at the end of the 
Quick Access toolbar and then click the Show Below the Ribbon option.
 
 When filling the Quick Access toolbar with buttons, you need to place 
the bar beneath the Ribbon so that it won’t crowd out the name of the 
current workbook file.
 
2. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button again and this time 
click the More Commands option.
 
 Excel opens the Excel Options dialog box with the Quick Access Toolbar 
tab selected. The Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box on the right 
side of this dialog box shows all three default buttons in the order in 
which they now appear on the toolbar.
 
3. Click the New option in the Popular Commands list box and then click 
the Add button.
 
 Excel adds the New command button at the end of the toolbar; you can 
see the New button in the Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box on 
the right.
 
4. Click the Move Up button (with the triangle pointing upward) three 
times to move the New button to the top of the Customize Quick Access 
Toolbar list box and the first position on the Quick Access toolbar.
 
 Note that the New button is now in front of the Save button on the toolbar.
 
5. Click the Open option in the Popular Commands list box on the left 
and then click the Add button.
 
 Excel inserts the Open button in the Customize Quick Access Toolbar 
list box in between the New and Save buttons, which is exactly where it 
appears on the Standard toolbar.

44
Migrating to Excel 2010 from Earlier Versions Relying on Pull-Down Menus
 
6. Click the Save button in the Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box 
on the right to select this button. Then, click the Quick Print option 
near the bottom of the Popular Commands list box on the left and 
then click the Add button.
 
 Excel inserts the Quick Print button after the Save button.
 
7. Click the Print Preview button near the bottom of the Popular 
Commands list box and then click the Add button.
 
 Excel inserts the Print Preview button after the Quick Print button in the 
Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box.
 
 Now, you need to add the Spelling and Research buttons. They are 
located on the Review tab in Excel 2010. Before you can add their 
buttons to the Quick Access toolbar, you need to replace Popular 
Commands with the Review Tab by selecting this option on the Choose 
Commands From drop-down list.
 
8. Click the Choose Commands From drop-down button and then click 
Review Tab in the drop-down list.
 
 Excel now displays all the command buttons on the Review tab of the 
Ribbon in the list box.
 
9. Add the Spelling and Research buttons from the Review Tab list box 
to the Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box and position them 
so that they appear one after the other following the Print Preview 
button.
 
 Next you need to add the Cut, Copy, Paste, and Format Painter buttons to 
the Quick Access toolbar. These command buttons are on the Home tab.
 
10. Click the Home Tab option on the Choose Commands From drop-down 
list and then add the Cut, Copy, Paste, and Format Painter buttons 
from the Home Tab list box to the Customize Quick Access Toolbar in 
this order in front of the Undo button.
 
 Note when adding the Paste button that Choose Commands From dis-
plays two Paste buttons. The first is the regular Paste button that was 
on the Standard toolbar. The second is a Paste button with a drop-down 
button that, when clicked, opens a drop-down menu with all the spe-
cial Paste options. You can add either one, although the second Paste 
button with the drop-down menu is much more versatile.
 
11. Click the Format Painter option in the Home Tab list box and then 
click the Add button.
 
 Excel adds the Format Painter button after the Paste button in the 
Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box on the right.
 
12. Click the Redo button in the Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box 
to select it and then click Insert Tab on the Choose Commands From 
drop-down list. Add the Insert Hyperlink button from the Insert Tab 
list box to the Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box.

13. Add the remaining Standard toolbar buttons — AutoSum, Sort 
Ascending, Sort Descending, and Create Chart — to the Quick Access 
toolbar.
 
 The AutoSum, Sort Ascending, and Sort Descending buttons are avail-
able in the Home Tab list box and the Charts button (the closest thing to 
the Chart Wizard in Excel 2010) is available in the Insert Tab list box.
 
14. Add the buttons on the 2003 Formatting toolbar to the Quick Access 
toolbar in the order in which they appear.
 
 The Formatting toolbar contains these tools (all found in the Home Tab 
list box): Font, Font Size, Bold, Italic, Underline, Align Left, Center, Align 
Right, Merge and Center, Accounting Number Format (corresponding 
to the Currency Style button), Percent Style, Comma Style, Increase 
Decimal, Decrease Decimal, Decrease Indent, Increase Indent, Borders, 
Fill Color, and Font Color.
 
15. Click the OK button to close the Excel Options dialog box and return 
to the Excel program window.
 
 Your Quick Access toolbar should now have the same buttons as the 
ones shown in Figures 1-8 and 1-9.
After adding all the buttons on the Standard and Formatting toolbars 
(with the exception of the Permission button that almost nobody uses, the 
Drawing button that has no equivalent in Excel 2010, and the Zoom and Help 
buttons that are always available in the Excel 2010 program window), the 
Quick Access toolbar fills the entire width of the screen on many monitors. 
Keep in mind that if you need to add extra buttons that can no longer be dis-
played on the single row above the Formula bar, Excel automatically adds a 
More Controls button to the end of the Quick Access toolbar. You then click 
this More Controls button to display a pop-up menu containing all the but-
tons that can no longer be displayed on the toolbar.
To add vertical bar separators to divide the buttons into groups as you see 
in the original Standard and Formatting toolbars and as shown in Figure 1-8, 
click the <Separator> option located at the top of each Choose Commands 
From list box followed by the Add button.
Coming up to speed with Excel 2010
The version of the Excel 2010 program window shown in Figures 1-8 and 
1-9, with the Ribbon minimized to just tabs and the Quick Access toolbar 
displayed above the Formula bar with all but a few of the buttons from the 
Standard and Formatting toolbars, is as close as I can get you to any sort of 
Excel 2003 Classic mode.
Combine this simplified screen layout with the common shortcut keys (see 
Table 1-2) that you already know, and you should be pretty much good to 
go with Excel 2010. You need to keep in mind that in the course of using the 

46
Migrating to Excel 2010 from Earlier Versions Relying on Pull-Down Menus
program, the Ribbon can’t always stay reduced to just its tabs. As you find 
out as you explore the features covered in the remaining chapters of this 
book, at times, you need the tools (especially in the form of those fantastic 
galleries) that a particular tab has to offer.
The only other issues that should be of any concern to you right now are 
the new Excel 2010 file formats and running all those Excel macros on which 
you’ve come to rely.
Dealing with the new Excel file formats
Yes, it’s true that Excel 2010 uses yet another new native file format in which 
to save its workbook files (although Microsoft insists that this one is truly an 
“open” XML file format and not at all proprietary like all the previous ones).
Fortunately, Excel 2010 has no trouble opening any workbook files saved in 
the good old .xls file format used by versions 97 through 2003. More impor-
tantly, the program automatically saves all editing changes you make to 
these files in this original file format.
Therefore, you don’t have a worry in the world when it comes to making 
simple edits to existing spreadsheets with Excel 2010. Simply open the work-
book file and then make all the necessary changes. When you finish, click the 
Save button on the Quick Access toolbar to save your changes in the good 
old .xls file format that everybody in the office who is still using a previous 
version of Excel can open, edit, and print. Excel also warns you if you ever 
add a new 2007 or 2010 element to the existing workbook that’s not sup-
ported by its earlier versions.
The challenge comes when you need to use Excel 2010 to create a brand-new 
spreadsheet. The program automatically wants to save all new workbooks 
in its fancy.xlsx file format (see Book I, Chapter 2 for a complete rundown 
on this new workbook file format and the pros and cons of using it). If you 
don’t want to save your workbook in this format, you need to remember to 
click the Save as Type drop-down button and then click the Excel 97-2003 
Workbook (*.xls) option on its drop-down menu before you click Save.
If you’re working in an office environment where all the workbooks you 
produce with Excel 2010 must be saved in the old 97-2003 file format for 
compatibility’s sake, you can change the program’s default Save setting 
so that the program always saves all new workbooks in the old file format. 
To do this, open the Save tab of the Excel Options dialog box (File Menu 
button➪Options or Alt+FIS) and then click Excel 97-2003 Workbook in the 
Save Files in This Format drop-down list box before you click OK.

Making the most of your macros
The good news is that Excel 2010 supports the creating and running of 
macros, using the same Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications of earlier ver-
sions. It even enables you to edit these macros in a version of VBA Editor, if 
you’re sufficiently skilled to do so.
The biggest problem with macros comes about if you have a tendency, 
like I do, to map your global macros (the ones you save in the personal.xls 
workbook so that they’re available when working in any Excel workbook) 
onto custom pull-down menus and toolbars. Because Excel 2010 retains only 
the single pull-down menu and Quick Access toolbar, none of the custom 
menus and toolbars to which you’ve assigned macros comes over to Excel 
2010. Therefore, although the macros are still a part of their respective 
workbooks and continue to run, you must now run all macros either using 
keyboard shortcuts you assigned to them or via the Macro dialog box (click 
View➪Macros➪View Macros or press Alt+WMV or Alt+F8).
You can assign macros to buttons on the Quick Access toolbar and then 
run them by clicking their buttons. The only problem is that all macros you 
assign to this toolbar use the same generic macro button icon, so that the 
only way to differentiate the macros is through the ScreenTip that appears 
when you position the mouse over the macro button.
To assign a macro to a generic macro on the Quick Access toolbar, open the 
Customize tab of the Excel Options dialog box (File Menu button➪Options or 
Alt+FIC) and then select Macros in the Choose Commands From drop-down 
list. Excel then displays the names of all the macros in the current workbook 
(including all global macros saved in the personal.xls workbook) in the Macros 
list box on the left. To assign a macro to a macro button, click its name in this 
list box and then click the Add button. You can then move the macro button 
to the desired position on the Quick Access toolbar with the Move Up and 
Move Down buttons and, if you so desire, make it part of a separate section on 
the toolbar by adding a <Separator> before and after its button.

T
here’s nothing quite like the feeling of getting just the help you need 
when you need it. That’s where the program’s extensive and completely 
modified Help Viewer comes in. You can use it to get help on almost any 
aspect of using Excel and, provided you have Internet access, it can supply 
you with the most up-to-date information.
In this chapter, you find out just how helpful the Excel 2010 Help feature 
can be as you use its Help Viewer and the Spotlight feature in the New 
Workbook dialog box to get answers to your immediate questions on using 
Excel features. You also gain access to the latest tips and articles on master-
ing the program along with links to online goodies such as workbook tem-
plates, training, and other downloads.
Browsing Excel 2010 Help
When you first open the Excel Help window — either by clicking the Help 
button (the one with the question mark to the right of the last tab on the 
Ribbon) or by pressing F1 — the Help Viewer appears in the window (see 
Figure 2-1).
To display information on any topic in the Browse Excel 2010 Help list, 
simply click its link. For example, to get help on charting data in your 
spreadsheet, click the Charts link in the original list. You then click the 
Creating Charts link to display a list of chart-related topics in the Excel Help 
window. For example, to get information on creating a new chart, you’d click 
the link to the Create a Chart from Start to Finish topic.

You can click the Show All link at the top right of an article to expand all 
the subtopics throughout the article before printing it. If you don’t want to 
expand all the subtopics throughout the article, you can click individual 
links to expand just those sections in which you’re interested.
 
You can find links to related articles in the See Also section at the very 
bottom of each article. Be sure to check these links out whenever you feel 
that you need more information about a topic than the article you selected 
gives you.

Using the Table of Contents
When you click the Show Table of Contents button on the Help Viewer tool-
bar (the one with the closed book), a Table of Contents pane appears on 
the left side of the window. The Table of Contents pane contains a list of all 
Excel 2010 help topics arranged hierarchically in topical categories.
When you first open the Table of Contents pane, only the main help catego-
ries are shown — the subtopics are collapsed beneath the main categories, 
as Figure 2-1 shows. To display a subcategory, click the closed book icon 
in front of the topic’s name. As soon as you do this, the closed book icon 
becomes an open book icon, and all the subtopics for that section of pane 
are displayed, indented below the main topic.
After you’ve displayed the subcategories beneath a main help topic, you 
can start burrowing deeper into a particular category by clicking its closed 
book icon. All main categories have subcategories, and some subcategories 
have their own subcategories. Regardless of the number of nested levels, 
however, you eventually come to a list of help pages, indicated by the blue 
question mark icon.
When you click a link with a blue question mark icon in the Table of 
Contents pane, Excel displays the help article in the right pane of the Help 
Viewer (see Figure 2-3). If the article has multiple sections, you can then 
expand all the information in the article by clicking the Show All link at the 
top of the article. Print the text by clicking the Print button.

Searching Office Online for Help
When you can’t readily find the help information you need in the Browse 
Excel 2010 Help topics or the Table of Contents pane of the Help Viewer, you 
can search for the information you need on Office Online, a Microsoft Web 
site that supplements the help topics copied onto your computer as part of 
the Office or Excel 2010 installation.
To get help from Office Online, all you have to do is follow these three easy 
steps:
 
1. Click the Microsoft Office Excel Help button (the one with the ques-
tion mark) or press F1.
 
 Excel opens the Help Viewer in the Excel Help window, similar to the 
one shown in Figure 2-1. Notice that this window opens as a less than 
full-size window that is floating on top of the Excel program window.
 
2. Type the keywords describing the topic that you want help with in the 
Search text box.
 
 Note that Excel automatically places the insertion point in the Search 
text box of the Help Viewer whenever you first open the Excel Help 
window.
 
3. Click the Search button or press Enter to display a list of possible help 
topics in the Search Results Task pane to the immediate right of the 
Table of Contents pane (see Figure 2-4).

If your computer doesn’t have access to the Internet at the time you’re 
searching for help topics, Excel then automatically displays only local help 
topics on your computer related to the search text you use (indicated by the 
Show Content from This Computer indicator in the lower-right corner of the 
Help window).
Displaying a help topic in the Search Results
After searching Office Online for help, Excel displays the list of articles as 
the search results in the main pane of the Help Viewer. If the key words you 
search for bring up more than one page of results, Excel adds Page buttons 
at the top of the pane along with a Go to Previous Page and Next buttons you 
can click to advance to later pages and revisit previous ones.
To display the text of one of the listed articles in the Help Viewer, click its link 
with the blue question mark icon. Whenever you click a link to an article when 
the Table of Contents pane is open in the Excel Help window, Excel automati-
cally displays the article’s name in the Table of Contents hierarchy in the left 
pane as it displays the article’s information in the pane on the right.
 
To return to the previous page of search results after displaying a particular 
help article in the Help Viewer, click the Back button on the toolbar at the 
top of the Excel Help window.
To download an Excel template file listed in the search results, click its 
link. Excel then launches your Web browser and opens the Microsoft Office 
Online Template Web page from which you can download that template

Searching Office Online for Help
file simply by clicking its Download button. After you finish downloading a 
template file, close your Web browser’s window by clicking its Close button 
to return to Excel where the program automatically opens a new workbook 
generated from the template. Then, to return to the Excel Help window, 
simply click the Excel Help button on the Windows Task pane.
Tiling the Excel Help and program windows
When you first open the Excel Help window, it opens as a less-than full-size 
window that floats over the Excel program window. By default, the pro-
gram selects the Keep on Top button so that the Excel Help window always 
appears on top of any other windows you have open along with it.
You can easily reposition the Excel Help window so that it’s side by side 
with the Excel program window, assuming that you’re not running any other 
programs. This window configuration enables you to peruse the help infor-
mation in the Help View and then immediately try applying it to the work-
sheet you have open (see Figure 2-5).

To set up this side-by-side window arrangement, you right-click the Windows 
taskbar and then, if you’re running Excel on Windows 7 or Vista, you click 
the Show Windows Side by Side option on the taskbar’s shortcut menu. (If, 
however, you’re running Excel on Windows XP, you have to click the Tile 
Windows Vertically option on its shortcut menu, instead.)
 
Close the Table of Contents pane in the Excel Help window by clicking 
the Close button in the upper-right corner of its pane or the Hide Table 
of Contents button (the one with the open book icon) on the Help toolbar 
before you tile it side by side with the Excel program window. Closing this 
pane gives you a lot more room in which to read the help information — you 
can always use the Search text box to look up the topic on which you need 
help and with which you want to experiment in the Excel program window.
After you finish using the help information in the Excel Help window, you 
can manually resize the window by dragging its sizing handle in the lower-
right corner before you close it by clicking its Close button. Then, maximize 
the Excel program window by clicking its Maximize button, the middle one 
of the three in the upper-right corner of the window.

Chapter 3: Customizing Excel
In This Chapter
✓ Customizing the Quick Access toolbar
✓ Changing various and sundry Excel program settings
✓ Extending Excel’s capabilities with add-in programs
C
hances are good that Excel 2010, as it comes right out of the box, 
is not always the best fit for the way you use the program. For that 
reason, Excel offers an amazing variety of ways to customize and configure 
the program’s settings so that they better suit your needs and the way you 
like to work.
This chapter covers the most important methods for customizing Excel set-
tings and features. The chapter looks at three basic areas where you can 
tailor the program to your individual needs:
 
✦ The first place ripe for customization is the Quick Access toolbar. Not 
only can you control which Excel command buttons (on and off of the 
Ribbon) appear on this toolbar, but you can also assign macros you 
create to this toolbar, making them instantly accessible.
 
✦ The second place where you may want to make extensive modifications 
is to the default settings (also referred to as options) that control any 
number of program assumptions and basic behaviors.
 
✦ The third place where you can customize Excel is in the world of add-
ins, those small, specialized utilities (sometimes called applets) that 
extend the built-in Excel features by attaching themselves to the main 
Excel program. Excel add-ins provide a wide variety of functions and 
are available from a wide variety of sources, including the original Excel 
2010 program, the Microsoft Office Web site, and various and sundry 
third-party vendors.
Tailoring the Quick Access Toolbar to Your Tastes
Excel 2010 enables you to easily make modifications to the Quick Access 
toolbar, the sole toolbar remaining in this newest version of the program. 
When you first launch Excel, this toolbar appears above the Ribbon with the 
three most commonly used command buttons: Save, Undo, and Redo.

58
Tailoring the Quick Access Toolbar to Your Tastes
Adding command buttons on the Ribbon 
to the Quick Access toolbar
Excel 2010 makes it super-easy to add a command from any tab on the 
Ribbon to the Quick Access toolbar. To add a Ribbon command, simply 
right-click its command button on the Ribbon and then click Add to Quick 
Access Toolbar on its shortcut menu. Excel immediately adds the command 
button to the very end of the Quick Access toolbar, immediately in front of 
the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button.
If you want to move the command button to a new location on the Quick 
Access toolbar or group it with other buttons on the toolbar, you need 
to click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button and then click More 
Commands on its drop-down menu.
Excel then opens the Excel Options dialog box with the Quick Access 
Toolbar tab selected (similar to the one shown in Figure 3-1). Here, Excel 
shows all the buttons currently added to the Quick Access toolbar with the 
order in which they appear from left to right on the toolbar corresponding 
to their top-down order in the list box on the right side of the dialog box.

dialog box

the

toolbar.
 
To reposition a particular button on the bar, click it in the list box on the 
right and then click either the Move Up button (the one with the black tri-
angle pointing upward) or the Move Down button (the one with the black

triangle pointing downward) until the button is promoted or demoted to the 
desired position on the toolbar.
 
You can add separators to the toolbar to group related buttons. To do this, 
click the <Separator> selection in the list box on the left and then click the 
Add button twice to add two. Then, click the Move Up or Move Down button 
to position one of the two separators at the beginning of the group and the 
other at the end.
 
If you’ve added too many buttons to the Quick Access toolbar and can no 
longer read the workbook name, you can reposition it so that it appears 
beneath the Ribbon immediately on top of the Formula bar. To do this, click 
the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button at the end of the toolbar and 
then click Show Below the Ribbon on the drop-down menu.
Adding non-Ribbon commands to the Quick Access toolbar
You can also use the options on the Quick Access Toolbar tab of the Excel 
Options dialog box (refer to Figure 3-1) to add a button for any Excel com-
mand even if it’s not one of those displayed on the tabs of the Ribbon:
 
1. Click the type of command you want to add to the Quick Access tool-
bar in the Choose Commands From drop-down list box.
 
 The types of commands include the default Popular Commands, 
Commands Not in the Ribbon, All Commands, and Macros, as well as 
each of the standard and Contextual tabs that can appear on the Ribbon. 
To display only the commands not displayed on the Ribbon, click 
Commands Not in the Ribbon near the top of the drop-down list. To dis-
play a complete list of all the Excel commands, click All Commands near

Adding macros to the Quick Access toolbar
If you’ve created favorite macros (see Book VIII, Chapter 1) that you rou-
tinely use and want to be able to run directly from the Quick Access toolbar, 
click Macros in the Choose Commands From drop-down list box and then 
click the name of the macro to add in the Choose Commands From list box 
followed by the Add button.

Excel 2010 then adds a custom macro command button to the end of the 
Quick Access toolbar whose generic icon displays the branching of a pro-
gramming diagram. This means that if you add several favorite macros to the 
Quick Access toolbar, the only way to tell them apart is by their ScreenTips, 
each of which displays the location and name of the macro attached to the 
particular custom button when you highlight the button by passing the 
mouse pointer over it.
Exercising Your Options
Each time you open a new workbook, Excel makes a whole bunch of assump-
tions about how you want the spreadsheet and chart information that you 
enter into it to appear on-screen and in print. These assumptions may or 
may not fit the way you work and the kinds of spreadsheets and charts you 
need to create.
In the following five sections, you get a quick rundown on how to change 
the most important default or preference settings in the Excel Options dialog 
box. This is the biggest dialog box in Excel, with a billion tabs (ten actually). 
From the Excel Options dialog box, you can see what things appear on-
screen and how they appear, as well as when and how Excel 2010 calculates 
worksheets.
 
Nothing discussed in the following five sections is critical to your being able 
to operate Excel. Just remember the Excel Options dialog box if you find 
yourself futzing with the same setting over and over again in most of the 
workbooks you create. In such a situation, it’s high time to get into the Excel 
Options dialog box and modify that setting so that you won’t waste any 
more time tinkering with the same setting in future workbooks.
Adding commands lost from earlier Excel 
versions to the Quick Access toolbar
Although certain commands from earlier 
versions of Excel, such as Data➪Form and 
Format➪AutoFormat, did not make it to the 
Ribbon in Excel 2010, this does not mean that 
they were entirely eliminated from the pro-
gram. The only way, however, to revive these 
commands is to add their command buttons to 
the Quick Access toolbar after choosing the 
Commands Not in the Ribbon category on the 
Choose Commands From drop-down list on the 
Customization tab of the Excel Options dialog 
box.

Changing some of the more universal 
settings on the General tab
The General tab (shown in Figure 3-2) is the first tab in the Excel Options 
dialog box. This tab is automatically selected whenever you first open this 
dialog box by clicking Microsoft File Menu➪ Options or by pressing Alt+FI.
 
Figure 3-2:

The options on the General tab are arranged into three groups: User 
Interface Options, When Creating New Workbooks, and Personalize Your 
Copy of Microsoft Office.
The User Interface Options group contains the following check boxes and 
buttons:
 
✦ Show Mini Toolbar on Selection: Disables or re-enables the display of 
the Mini Toolbar, which contains essential formatting buttons from the 
Home tab, above a cell selection or other object’s shortcut menu when 
you right-click it.
 
✦ Enable Live Preview: Disables or re-enables the Live Preview feature 
whereby Excel previews the data in the current cell selection using the 
font or style you highlight in a drop-down list or gallery before you actu-
ally apply the formatting.

Exercising Your Options
 
✦ Color Scheme: Selects a new color scheme for the Excel 2010 screen: 
Silver, Blue (the default color scheme), or Black.
 
✦ ScreenTip Style: Changes the way ScreenTips (that display information 
about the command buttons you highlight with the mouse) are displayed 
on-screen. Click Don’t Show Feature Descriptions in ScreenTips on the 
ScreenTip Style drop-down list to display a minimum amount of descrip-
tion in the ScreenTip and eliminate all links to online help, or click Don’t 
Show ScreenTips to completely remove the display of ScreenTips from 
the screen.
The options in the When Creating New Workbooks section of the Popular 
tab of the Excel Options dialog box include only these four combo and text 
boxes:
 
✦ Use This Font: Select a new default font to use in all cells of new work-
sheets by entering the font name in the combo box or selecting its name 
by clicking it on the drop-down list. (Arial is the default font for Excel 
running on Windows XP, and Body Font, which is actually Calibri in the 
worksheet, is the default font when running it on Windows Vista.)
 
✦ Font Size: Select a new default size to use in all cells of new worksheets 
(10 points is the default size for Excel running on Windows XP, and 11 
points is the default size when running it on Windows Vista) by entering 
the value in the box or select this new point value by clicking it on the 
drop-down list.
 
✦ Default View for New Sheets: Select either Page Break Preview (display-
ing page breaks that you can adjust) or Page Layout (displaying page 
breaks, rulers, and margins) as the default view (rather than Normal) for 
all new worksheets.
 
✦ Include This Many Sheets: Increase or decrease the default number of 
worksheets in each new workbook (3 being the default) by entering a 
number between 1 and 225 or select this new number by clicking the 
spinner buttons.
The final section, Personalize Your Copy of Microsoft Office, contains the 
sole User Name text box that enables you to change the user name that’s 
used as the default author for new workbooks created with Excel 2010.
Changing common calculation 
options on the Formulas tab
The options on the Formulas tab (see Figure 3-3) of the Excel Options dialog 
box (File Menu➪Options➪Formulas or Alt+FIF) are divided into Calculation 
Options, Working with Formulas, Error Checking, and Error Checking Rules.

Figure 3-3: 
The 
Formulas 
tab’s 
options 
enable 
you to 
change how 
formulas 
in the

are re-
calculated.
 
The Calculation options enable you to change when formulas in your work-
book are recalculated and whether and how a formula that Excel cannot 
solve on the first try (such as one with a circular reference) is recalculated. 
Choose from the following items:
 
✦ Automatic option button (the default) to have Excel recalculate all for-
mulas immediately after you modify any of the values on which their 
calculation depends.
 
✦ Automatic Except for Data Tables option button to have Excel automati-
cally recalculate all formulas except for those entered into what-if data 
tables you create (see Book VII, Chapter 1) — to update these formulas, 
you must click the Calculate Now (F9) or the Calculate Sheet (Shift+F9) 
command button on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon.
 
✦ Manual option button to switch to total manual recalculation, whereby 
formulas that need updating are only recalculated when you click the 
Calculate Now (F9) or the Calculate Sheet (Shift+F9) command button on 
the Formulas tab of the Ribbon.
 
✦ Enable Iterative Calculation check box to enable or disable iterative cal-
culations for formulas that Excel finds that it cannot solve on the first try.
 
✦ Maximum Iterations text box to change the number of times (100 is the 
default) that Excel recalculates a seemingly insolvable formula when the 
Enable Iterative Calculation check box contains a check mark by enter-
ing a number between 1 and 32767 in the text box or by selecting by 
clicking the spinner buttons.

✦ Maximum Change text box to change the amount by which Excel incre-
ments the guess value it applies each time the program recalculates the 
formula in an attempt to solve it by entering the new increment value in 
the text box.
The Working with Formulas sections contains four check box options that 
determine a variety of formula-related options:
 
✦ R1C1 Reference Style check box (unchecked by default) to enable or 
disable the R1C1 cell reference system whereby both columns and rows 
are numbered as in R45C2 for cell B45.
 
✦ Formula AutoComplete check box (checked by default) to disable or 
re-enable the Formula AutoComplete feature whereby Excel attempts to 
complete the formula or function you’re manually building in the current 
cell.
 
✦ Use Table Names in Formulas check box (checked by default) to disable 
and re-enable the feature whereby Excel automatically applies all range 
names you’ve created in a table of data to all formulas that refer to their 
cells (see Book III, Chapter 1).
 
✦ Use GetPivotData Functions for PivotTable References check box 
(checked by default) to disable and re-enable the GetPivotTable function 
that Excel uses to extract data from various fields in a data source when 
placing them in various fields of a pivot table summary report you’re 
creating (see Book VII, Chapter 2 for details).
The remaining options on the Formulas tab of the Excel Options dialog box 
enable you to control error-checking for formulas. In the Error Checking sec-
tion, the sole check box, Enable Background Error Checking, which enables 
error-checking in the background while you’re working in Excel, is checked. 
In the Error Checking Rules, all of the check box options are checked, with 
the exception of the Formulas Referring to Empty Cells check box, which 
indicates a formula error when a formula refers to a blank cell.
 
To disable background error checking, click the Enable Background Error 
Checking check box to remove its check mark. To change the color used to 
indicate formula errors in cells of the worksheet (when background error 
checking is engaged), click the Indicate Errors Using This Color drop-down 
button and click a new color square on its drop-down color palette. To 
remove the color from all cells in the worksheet where formula errors are 
currently indicated, click the Reset Ignore Errors button. To disable other 
error-checking rules, click their check boxes to remove the check marks.
Changing correction options on the Proofing tab
The options on the Proofing tab (see Figure 3-4) of the Excel Options dialog 
box (File Menu➪Options➪Proofing or Alt+FIP) are divided into two sections: 
AutoCorrect Options and When Correcting Spelling in Office Programs.

Click the AutoCorrect Options button to open the AutoCorrect dialog box for 
the primary language used in Microsoft Office 2010. This dialog box contains 
the following three tabs:
 
✦ AutoCorrect with check box options that control what corrections 
Excel automatically makes, an Exceptions button that enables you to 
indicate what words or abbreviations are not to be capitalized in the 
AutoCorrect Exceptions dialog box, and text boxes where you can define 
custom replacements that Excel makes as you type.
 
✦ AutoFormat As You Type with check box options that control whether 
to replace Internet addresses and network paths with hyperlinks, and 
to automatically insert new rows and columns to cell ranges defined as 
tables and copy formulas in calculated fields to new rows of a data list.
 
✦ Smart Tags with various options for enabling and controlling Smart Tags 
that automatically link particular cell entries in the workbook with other 
data sources (see Book IV, Chapter 4 for details on using Smart Tags).
The options in the When Correcting Spelling in Office Programs section of 
the Proofing tab control what type of errors Excel flags as possible misspell-
ings when you use the Spell Check feature (see Book II, Chapter 3). It also 
contains the following drop buttons:
 
✦ Custom Dictionaries, which opens the Custom Dictionaries dialog box, 
where you can specify a new custom dictionary to use in spell checking

Changing various save options on the Save tab
The options on the Save tab (see Figure 3-5) of the Excel Options dialog box 
(Microsoft File Menu➪Options➪Save or Alt+FIS) are divided into four sec-
tions: Save Workbooks, AutoRecover Exceptions for the Current Workbook 
(Book1), Offline Editing Options for Document Management Server Files, and 
Preserve Visual Appearance of the Workbook.
 
Figure 3-5: 
The Save 
tab’s 
options 
enable 
you to 
change the 
automatic 
backup and

options.
 
The settings in the Save Workbooks section on this tab include the pro-
gram’s AutoRecover settings. The AutoRecover feature enables Excel to 
save copies of your entire Excel workbook at the interval displayed in the 
Minutes text box (10 by default). You tell Excel where to save these copies 
in the AutoRecover File Location text box by specifying a drive, a folder, and 
maybe even a subfolder.
If your computer should crash or you suddenly lose power, the next time 
you start Excel the program automatically displays an AutoRecover pane. 
From this pane, you can open a copy of the workbook file that you were 

Book I

Exercising Your Options
working on when this crash or power loss occurred. If this recovered work-
book (saved at the time of the last AutoRecover) contains information that 
isn’t saved in the original copy (the copy you saved the last time you used 
the Save command before the crash or power loss), you can then use the 
recovered copy rather than manually reconstructing and reentering the oth-
erwise lost information.
You may also use the recovered copy of a workbook, should the original 
copy of the workbook file become corrupted in such a way that Excel can no 
longer open it. (This happens very rarely, but it does happen.)
 
Don’t disable the AutoRecover feature by selecting the Disable AutoRecover 
for This Workbook Only check box on the Save tab, even if you have a bat-
tery backup system for your computer that gives you plenty of time to 
manually save your Excel workbook during any power outage. Disabling 
AutoRecover in no way protects you from data loss if your workbook file 
becomes corrupted or you hit the computer’s power switch by mistake.
 
If your company enables you to share the editing of certain Excel workbooks 
through the Excel Services offered as part of SharePoint Services software, 
you can change the location where Excel saves drafts of the workbook files 
you check out for editing. By default, Excel saves the drafts of these checked-
out workbook files locally on your computer’s hard drive inside a SharePoint 
Drafts folder in the Documents (Windows 7 or Vista) or My Documents 
(Windows XP) folder. If your company or IT department prefers that you save 
these draft files on the Web server that contains the SharePoint software, 
click the Web Server option button to deselect the Server Drafts Location on 
This Computer option button and then enter the network path in the Server 
Drafts Location text box. Alternatively, click the Browse button and locate the 
network drive and folder in the Browse dialog box.
 
If you share your Excel 2010 workbooks with other less fortunate workers 
who are still using older versions (97 through 2003) of Excel, use the Colors 
command button to determine which color in the Excel 2010 worksheet to 
preserve in formatted tables and other graphics when you save the work-
book file for them using the Excel 97-2003 file format option (see Book II, 
Chapter 1).
Changing a whole lot of other common 
options on the Advanced tab
The options on the Advanced tab (see Figure 3-6) of the Excel Options 
dialog box (File Menu➪Options➪Advanced or Alt+FIA) are divided into ten 
sections: Editing Options; Cut, Copy, and Paste; Display; Display Options 
for This Workbook; Display Options for This Worksheet; Formulas; When 
Calculating This Workbook; General; Lotus Compatibility; and Lotus 
Compatibility Settings.

68
Exercising Your Options
The various and sundry options in these ten sections of the Advanced tab 
actually fall into four somewhat distinct areas: options for editing in the 
worksheet; options controlling the screen display; a potpourri area of formu-
las, calculating, and general options; and Lotus compatibility options for old 
Lotus 1-2-3 users (assuming that there are still some of you left) who are just 
now upgrading to Excel to make the transition easier.
Working the worksheet editing options
As you can see in Figure 3-6, the options in the Editing Options and Cut, 
Copy, and Paste sections on the Advanced tab control what happens when 
you edit the contents of an Excel worksheet.

When you first open the Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog box, all of 
the check box options in the Editing Options and Cut, Copy, and Paste sec-
tions are checked with the exception of these two:
 
✦ Automatically Insert a Decimal Point to have Excel add a decimal point 
during data entry of all values in each worksheet using the number of 
places in the Places text box (see Book II, Chapter 1 for details).
 
✦ Zoom on Roll with IntelliMouse to have Excel increase or decrease the 
screen magnification percentage by 15 percent on each roll forward and 
back of the center wheel of a mouse that supports Microsoft’s IntelliMouse 
technology — when this option is not checked, Excel scrolls the worksheet 
up and down on each roll forward and back of the center wheel.

Most of the time, you’ll want to keep all the check box options in the Editing 
Options and Cut, Copy, and Paste sections checked. The only one of these 
you might want to disengage is the Use System Separators check box when 
you routinely create spreadsheets with financial figures expressed in foreign 
currency that don’t use the period (.) as the decimal point and the comma (,) 
as the thousands separator. After you remove the check mark from the Use 
System Separators check box, the Decimal Separator and Thousands 
Separator text boxes become active and you can then enter the appropriate 
punctuation into these two boxes.
 
By default, Excel selects Down as the Direction setting when the After 
Pressing Enter, Move Selection check box option is checked. If you want 
Excel to automatically advance the cell cursor in another direction (Right, 
Up, or Left), click this direction on its drop-down list. If you don’t want Excel 
to move the cell cursor outside of the active cell upon completion of the 
entry (the same as clicking the Enter button on the Formula bar), click the 
After Pressing Enter, Move Selection check box to remove its check mark.
Playing around with the display options
The display options in the middle of the Advanced tab of the Excel Options 
dialog box (see Figure 3-7) fall into three categories: general Display options 
that affect the Excel program, Display Options for This Workbook that affect 
the current workbook, and Display Options for This Worksheet that affect 
the active sheet in the workbook.
 
Figure 3-7:

Exercising Your Options
Most of the options in these three categories are self-explanatory as they 
either turn off or on the display of particular screen elements such as the 
Formula bar, ScreenTips, scroll bars, sheet tabs, column and row headers, 
page breaks, (cell) gridlines, and the like.
 
When using these display options to control the display of various Excel 
screen elements, keep the following things in mind:
 
✦ The Ruler Units drop-down list box automatically uses the Default Units 
for your version of Microsoft Office (Inches in the U.S. and Centimeters 
in Europe). These default units (or those you specifically select on the 
drop-down list: Inches, Centimeters, or Millimeters) are then displayed 
on both the horizontal and vertical rulers that appear above and to the 
left of the column and row headings only when you put the Worksheet 
area display into Page Layout View (Alt+WP).
 
✦ Click the Comments and Indicators option button under the For Cells 
with Comments, Show heading when you want Excel to display the text 
boxes with the comments you add to cells at all times in the worksheet 
(see Book IV, Chapter 3).
 
✦ Click the Edit Custom Lists command button to create or edit custom 
AutoFill lists that you generate by entering the initial entry in the custom 
list and then dragging the Fill handle in a single direction to enter the 
others (see Book II, Chapter 1).
 
✦ Click the Nothing (Hide Objects) option button under the For Objects, 
Show heading when you want Excel to hide the display of all graphic 
objects in the worksheet, including embedded charts, clip art, imported 
pictures, and all graphics that you generate in the worksheet (see Book 
V, Chapters 1 and 2 for details).
 
✦ Click the Show Page Breaks check box to remove its check mark when-
ever you need to remove the dotted lines indicating page breaks in 
Normal (Alt+WN) view after viewing the Worksheet area in either Page 
Break Preview (Alt+WI) or Page Layout View (Alt+WP).
 
✦ Instead of going to the trouble of clicking the Show Formulas in Cells 
Instead of Their Calculated Results check box to display formulas in 
the cells of the worksheet, simply press Ctrl+’ (apostrophe) or click 
the Show Formulas button on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon. Both the 
keystroke shortcut and the button are toggles so that you can return 
the Worksheet area to its normal display showing the calculated results 
rather than the formulas by pressing the Ctrl+’ shortcut keys again or 
clicking the Show Formulas button.
 
✦ Instead of going to the trouble of removing the check mark from the 
Show Gridlines check box whenever you want to remove the column and 
row lines that define the cells in the Worksheet area, click the Gridlines 
check box in the Show/Hide group on the View tab or the View check 
box in the Gridlines column of the Sheet Options group on the Page 
Layout tab to remove their check marks.

makes the cell boundaries stand out particularly well and gives the screen a 
hint of the old paper green-sheet look.)
Caring about the Formulas, Calculating, and General options
At the bottom of the Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog box (see 
Figure 3-8), you find a regular mix of options in five sections. The first three 
sections, Formulas, When Calculating This Workbook, and General, contain a 
veritable potpourri of options.

The settings of most of the options in these three sections won’t need 
changing. In rare cases, you may find that you have to activate the following 
options or make modifications to some of their settings:
 
✦ Set Precision as Displayed: Click this check box only when you want 
to permanently change the calculated values in the worksheet to the 
number of places currently shown in their cells as the result of the 
number format applied to them.
 
✦ Use 1904 Date System: Click this check box when you’re dealing with a 
worksheet created with an earlier Macintosh version of Excel that used 
1904 rather than 1900 as date serial number 1.

✦ Web Options: Click this command button to display the Web Options 
dialog box, where you can modify the options that control how your

Explorer.
Laying on the Lotus 1-2-3 compatibility
The last two sections on the Advanced tab, Lotus Compatibility and Lotus 
Compatibility Settings For, are only of interest to Lotus 1-2-3 users who are 
just now coming to use Microsoft Excel as their spreadsheet program.
 
If you’re a dyed-in-the-wool 1-2-3 user, you’ll definitely want to put a check 
mark in all three check boxes, Transition Navigation Keys, Transition 
Formula Evaluation, and Transition Formula Entry, in both the Lotus 
Compatibility and Lotus Compatibility Settings For sections. That way, you’ll 
be able to start formulas with built-in functions with the @ symbol — which 
Excel dutifully converts to an equal sign (=) — as well as use all the keys for 
navigating the worksheet to which you’ve become so accustomed.
 
Keep in mind that you can activate the hot keys on the Excel Ribbon by 
pressing the forward slash (/) key even when none of the Lotus compatibility 
options are selected. When I want to use the program’s hot keys to select an 
Excel command from the Ribbon, I find pressing the forward slash, which 
activated the pull-down menus in Lotus 1-2-3, much easier than pressing the 
Alt key — this is because / is part of the QWERTY keyboard. This means that 
whenever you see a keyboard shortcut such as Alt+WP in the book, you can 
just press /WP (which in this particular case puts the Worksheet display 
area into Page Layout View).
Modifying the Ribbon with the 
Customize Ribbon option
The options on the new Customize Ribbon tab (see Figure 3-9) of the Excel 
Options dialog box (File Menu➪Options➪Customize Ribbon or Alt+FIC) 
enable you to modify which tabs appear on the Excel Ribbon and the order 
in which they appear, as well as to change which groups of command but-
tons appear on each of these displayed tabs. You can even use its options to 
create brand new tabs for the Ribbon as well as to create custom groups of 
command buttons within any of the displayed tabs.
Customizing the tabs on the default Excel Ribbon
If you find the default arrangement of tabs and groups on the Excel Ribbon 
is not entirely to your liking, you can simplify or rearrange them to suit the 
way you routinely work:

✦ Remove tabs from the Ribbon by deselecting their check boxes in the 
Main Tabs list box on the right side of the Excel Options dialog box. (To 
later redisplay a hidden tab, you simply select its check box.)
 
✦ Modify tab order on the Ribbon by selecting the tab to move and then 
click either the Move Up button (with the triangle pointing up) or Move 
Down button (the the triangle pointing down) until the name of the tab 
appears in the desired position in list shown in the Main Tabs list box.
 
✦ Modify group order on a tab by first expanding the tab to display the 
groups by clicking the Expand button (with the plus sign) in front of the 
tab name in the Main Tabs list box. Next click the name of the group you 
want to reposition and click either the Move Up or Move Down button 
until it appears in the desired position in the list.
 
✦ Remove a group from a tab by selecting its name in the expanded Main 
Tabs list and then click the Remove command button (under the Add 
button between the two list boxes that now appear in the main section 
of the Excel Options dialog box).
In addition to the main tabs of the Ribbon, you can control which groups of 
command buttons appear on its various contextual tabs (such as the Table 
Tools or Chart Tools contextual tabs that automatically appear when you’re 
working on an Excel table of data or chart):

74
Exercising Your Options
 
✦ Display the groups to be modified on a contextual tab by clicking the 
Tool Tabs option on the Customize the Ribbon drop-down list and then 
clicking the Expand button in front of the contextual tab whose groups 
you want to modify.
 
✦ Modify the group order on a contextual tab by clicking the group name 
and then clicking the Move Up or Move Down buttons to move it into its 
new position.
 
✦ Remove a group from a contextual tab by clicking its group name and 
then clicking the Remove command button.
 
To restore the original groups to a particular tab you’ve modified, select 
the tab in the Customize the Ribbon list box on the right side of the Excel 
Options dialog box and then click the Restore Defaults drop-down button 
beneath this list box before you select the Restore Only Select Ribbon Tab 
option.
 
If you want to restore all the tabs and groups on the Ribbon to their original 
default arrangement, you can click the Restore Defaults drop-down button 
and then click the Restore All Ribbon Tabs and Quick Access Toolbar 
Customizations option on its drop-down menu. Just be aware that selecting 
this option not only restores the Ribbon’s default settings but negates all 
changes you’ve made to the Quick Access toolbar at the same time. If you 
don’t want this to happen, restore the tabs of the ribbon individually using 
the Restore Only Select Ribbon tab option described in the preceding tip.
Adding new tabs and groups to the Excel Ribbon
The Customize Ribbon tab of the Excel Options dialog box not only lets you 
customize the existing Ribbon tabs but also lets you add ones of your own. 
This is great news for those of us who want Ribbon access to Excel com-
mands we routinely rely on that didn’t make it to the default Ribbon.
To add a brand new tab to the Ribbon, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Customize Ribbon tab of the Excel Options dialog (File 
Menu➪Options➪Customize Ribbon or Alt+FIC).
 
 Excel opens the Customize Ribbon tab with the Main Tabs selected in 
the Customize the Ribbon list box on the right.
 
2. Select the tab under Main Tabs in this list box immediately after 
which the new Ribbon is to be inserted.
 
 By default, Excel inserts the new tab after the one that’s currently 
selected in the Customize the Ribbon list box. This means that if you 
want your new custom tab to precede the Home tab, you must to put it 
ahead of the Home tab with the Move Up button after first creating the 
new tab behind it.

3. Click the New Tab command button below under Main Tabs in the 
Customize the Ribbon list box.
 
 Excel inserts a tab called New Tab (Custom) with the single group called 
New Group (Custom) displayed and selected. This New Tab (Custom) is 
placed immediately after the currently selected tab.
 
4. Add all the commands you want in this group on the custom tab by 
selecting them in the Choose Commands From list box and then click-
ing the Add command button.
 
 When adding commands, you can select them from any of the categories: 
Popular Commands, Commands Not in the Ribbon, All Commands, Macros, 
Office Menu, All Tabs, Main Tabs, Tool Tabs, and Custom Tabs and Groups 
(which lists all custom tabs and groups you’ve previously created).
 
 As you add each command from these categories, Excel displays the 
button’s icon and name in the list beneath New Group (Custom) in the 
left-to-right order in which they’ll appear (see Figure 3-10). To change 
the order of these command buttons in the new group on the custom 
tab, click the Move Up and/or Move Down buttons.
 
5. Rename the new group by clicking the Rename button under the 
Customize the Ribbon list box and then typing the new name in the 
Display Name text box of the Rename dialog box before clicking OK.
 
6. (Optional) To add other group to the same custom tab, click the New 
Group button under the Customize the Ribbon list box and then add 
all its command buttons before renaming it (refer to Steps 4 and 5).
 
 To add any additional groups of commands to be included on the new 
custom tab, simply repeat Step 6. Use the Move Up and Move Down but-
tons if you need to reposition any groups on the custom tab.
 
7. Rename the custom tab by clicking the New Tab (Custom) in the 
Customize the Ribbon list box. Then, click Rename button and type 
the name for the tab in the Display Name text box of the Rename 
dialog box before you click OK.
 
 To add additional custom tabs to the Ribbon, repeat Steps 2 through 7. 
After you finish all your custom tabs to the Ribbon, you’re ready to close 
the Excel Options dialog box and return to the worksheet.
 
8. Click the OK button in the Excel Options dialog box.
 
 When Excel closes this dialog box and returns you to the worksheet, 
the new custom tab appears in the Ribbon at the position where you 
placed it.
Figure 3-11 shows you the Excel Ribbon on my computer after I added a Misc 
tab to the very end. As you can see, when this tab is selected it contains 
three custom groups: Old Friends with AutoFormat, Print Preview, and Form 
buttons; Text to Speech with the Speak Cells and Stop Speaking buttons; and 
Web Options with Publish as Web Page and Web Page Preview buttons.

If you use shortcut keys to access Ribbon commands, keep in mind that 
Excel automatically assigns hot-key letters to each of the custom tabs and 
commands you add to the Ribbon. To display the custom tabs’ hot keys, 
press the Alt key. To display the hot keys assigned to the commands on a 
particular custom tab, type its specific hot-key letter.
Add-in Mania
Add-ins are small, specialized programs that extend Excel’s built-in features 
in some way. Most of the add-in programs created for Excel offer you some 
kind of specialized function or group of functions that extend Excel’s compu-
tational abilities. Before you can use any add-in program, the add-in must be 
installed in the proper folder on your hard drive, and then you must select 
the add-in in the Add-Ins dialog box.
There are three different types of add-in programs you can use to extend the 
features in Excel 2010:
 
✦ Built-in add-ins available when you install Excel 2010
 
✦ Add-ins that you can download for Excel 2010 from Microsoft’s Office 
Online Web site (www.office.microsoft.com)
 
✦ Add-ins developed by third-party vendors for Excel 2010 that often must 
be purchased
When you first install Excel 2010, the built-in add-in programs included with 
Excel are not loaded and therefore are not yet ready to use. To load any or 
all of these built-in add-in programs, you follow these steps:
 
1. Click Microsoft File Menu, click Excel Options or press Alt+FI to open 
the Excel Options dialog box, and then click the Add-Ins tab.
 
 The Add-Ins tab lists all the names, locations, and types of the add-ins to 
which you have access.
 
2. Click the Go button while Excel Add-Ins is selected in the Manage 
drop-down list box.
 
 Excel opens the Add-Ins dialog box (similar to the one shown in Figure 
3-12), showing all the names of the built-in add-in programs you can load.
 
3. Click the check boxes for each add-in program that you want loaded 
in the Add-Ins Available list box.
 
 Click the name of the add-in in the Add-Ins Available list box to display a 
brief description of its function at the bottom of this dialog box.

78
Add-in Mania
 
4. Click the OK button to close the Add-Ins dialog box.
 
 As soon as you close the Add-Ins dialog box, an alert dialog box asking 
you if you want to install each selected add-in appears.
 
5. Click the OK button in each alert dialog box to install its add-in.
 
Figure 3-12: 
Activating 
built-in 
add-ins in 
the Add-Ins 
dialog box.
 
After loading add-ins in this manner, Excel automatically places an Add-Ins 
tab at the end of the Ribbon. This Add-Ins tab displays the names of all the 
add-in programs that you’ve loaded. To then use any of these add-ins, click 
the Add-Ins tab (or press Alt+X) and then click the name of the particular 
add-in you wish to use.
 
If you end up never using a particular add-in you’ve loaded onto the Add-
Ins tab, you can unload it (and thereby free up some computer memory) by 
following the previously outlined procedure to open the Add-Ins dialog box 
and then clicking the name of the add-in to remove the check mark from its 
check box before you click OK.
Excel add-in programs are saved in a special file format identified with the 
.XLA or .XLAM (for Excel Add-in) filename extension. These files are nor-
mally saved inside the Library folder (sometimes in their own subfolders) 
that is located in the Office14 folder. The Office14 folder, in turn, is located 
in your Microsoft Office folder inside the Program Files folder on your hard 
drive (often designated as the C:\ drive). In other words, the path is
c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\Library
After an add-in program has been installed in the Library folder, its name 
then appears in the list box of the Add-Ins dialog box.
 
If you ever copy an XLA add-in program to a folder other than the Library 
folder in the Office14 folder on your hard drive, its name won’t appear in the 
Add-ins Available list box when you open the Add-Ins dialog box. You can, 

Book I

however, activate the add-in by clicking the Browse button in this dialog box 
and then selecting the add-in file in its folder in the Browse dialog box before 
you click OK.
Add-ins included with Excel
Whether you know it or not, you already have a group of add-in programs 
waiting for you to install and load. The following add-in programs are 
included with Excel 2010:
 
✦ Analysis ToolPak: Adds extra financial, statistical, and engineering func-
tions to Excel’s pool of built-in functions.
 
✦ Analysis ToolPak - VBA: Enables VBA programmers to publish their 
own financial, statistical, and engineering functions for Excel.
 
✦ Euro Currency Tools: Enables you to format worksheet values as euro 
currency and adds a EUROCONVERT function for converting other cur-
rencies into euros.
 
✦ Solver Add-In: Calculates solutions to what-if scenarios based on 
cells that both adjust and constrain the range of values (see Book VII, 
Chapter 1).
The first time you attempt to load any of these add-ins included with Excel, 
the program immediately displays an alert dialog box, telling you that the 
add-in is not currently installed and asking you if you want to install it. (All 
the included add-ins are marked for installation on first use so that they 
show up in the list box in the Add-Ins dialog box but do not actually take up 
disk space until you’re ready to use them.) Click the Yes button in this alert 
dialog box to have the selected add-in (or add-ins) in this list installed. Keep 
in mind that Excel needs access to your Office 2010 DVD or its files on your 
network in order to install any of these included add-in programs.
After you install and load these add-in programs, Excel displays new com-
mand buttons for most of them on the Add-Ins tab of the Ribbon that you 
click when you want to use them. So, for example, you click the Solver 
Add-In button on the Add-Ins tab when you want to use the Solver Add-
In, and the Euro Conversion button when you want to open the Euro 
Conversion dialog box to convert a range of values from some old European 
currency such as francs or deutsch marks to euros.
 
To use one of the additional statistical or financial functions added as part of 
the Analysis ToolPak add-in, you don’t access the Add-Ins tab. Instead, click 
the Function Wizard button on the Formula bar, click either Financial or 
Statistical in the Select a Category drop-down list, and then locate the func-
tion to use in the Select a Function list box below.

Add-in Mania
Purchasing third-party add-ins
The add-ins included with Excel are not the only Excel add-ins that you can 
lay your hands on. Many third-party vendors sell Excel add-ins that you can 
often purchase online and then immediately download onto your hard drive.
To find third-party vendors and get information on their add-ins, open your 
Web browser and do a search for
Excel add-ins
Even before you do a Web search, you may want to visit Macro Systems’ 
Web site at
www.add-ins.com
This online outfit offers a wide variety of useful Excel add-ins. One example 
is the Name Splitter that automatically splits full names that have been 
entered into single cells into individual first name, middle name or initial, 
and last name cells (so that the list can then be better sorted and filtered by 
parts of the names).
Note that you can expect to pay Macro Systems between $25.00 and $50.00 
for add-in programs such as these (really reasonably priced if you consider 
how many man-hours it would take to split up names into separate cells in 
huge worksheets).

efore you can begin building a new spreadsheet in Excel, you must 
have the design in mind. As it turns out, the design aspect of the cre-
ative process is often the easiest part because you can borrow the design 
from other workbooks that you’ve already created or from special work-
book files, called templates, which provide you with the new spreadsheet’s 
form, along with some of the standard, or boilerplate, data entries.
After you’ve settled upon the design of your new spreadsheet, you’re ready 
to begin entering its data. In doing the data entry in a new worksheet, you 
have several choices regarding the method to use. For this reason, this 
chapter not only covers all the methods for entering data — from the most 
basic to the most sophisticated — but also includes hints on when each 
is the most appropriate. Note, however, that this chapter doesn’t include 
information on building formulas, which comprises a major part of the data 
entry task in creating a new spreadsheet. Because this task is so specialized 
and so extensive, you find the information on formula building covered in 
Book III, Chapter 1.
Designer Spreadsheets
Each and every time you start Excel without also opening an existing work-
book file, the program presents you with a new workbook (with the generic 
filename, Book1), consisting of three totally blank worksheets. At this point, 
you can either launch into building your new spreadsheet by using the 
workbook’s three blank worksheets, or you can open a spreadsheet tem-
plate or existing workbook file and then adapt the template’s or workbook 
file’s design by entering the data for the new spreadsheet.

84
Designer Spreadsheets
Take it from a template
Spreadsheet templates are the way to go if you can find one that fits the 
design of the spreadsheet that you’re building. You can choose from a 
couple of good sources for ready-made spreadsheet templates. First, you 
can try using the spreadsheet templates automatically installed with the 
Excel program. Second, you can also download free spreadsheet templates 
from the Microsoft Office Web site.
Instead of using ready-made templates, you can create your own templates 
from your favorite Excel workbooks. After you save a copy of a workbook 
as a template file, Excel automatically generates a copy of the workbook 
whenever you open the template file. This way, you can safely customize the 
contents of the new workbook without any danger of inadvertently modify-
ing the original template.
Using the installed templates
The following sample templates are automatically installed when you start 
using Excel 2010:
 
✦ Billing Statement
 
✦ Blood Pressure Tracker
 
✦ Expense Report
 
✦ Loan Amortization
 
✦ Personal Monthly Budget
 
✦ Sales Report
 
✦ Timecard
To create a new worksheet based on any of these sample templates, click 
File➪New or press Alt+FN to open the Available Templates panel in the Excel 
Backstage view. Then, click Sample Templates at the top to display a list 
of these templates along with thumbnail images and a Create button to the 
right of the list (see Figure 1-1).
Figure 1-2 shows a copy of a blank billing statement generated from the Billing 
Statement template after you click the Create button under its thumbnail 
image. As you can see on the Excel window title bar in this figure, when Excel 
generated this first workbook from the original template file, the program also 
gave it the temporary filename, BillingStatement1. If you were to then create a 
second copy of the sales invoice by once again opening the Billing Statement 
template, the program would name that copy BillingStatement2. This way, you

don’t have to worry about one copy overwriting another, and you never risk 
mistakenly saving changes to the original Billing Statement template file itself 
(which actually uses a completely different filename extension — .xltx for an 
Excel template as opposed to .xlsx for an Excel worksheet).
 
Figure 1-1: 
Selecting 
a sample 
template 
from which

a new 
workbook.
 
To fill in the blanks in a spreadsheet generated from one of the installed 
templates, you click the first blank cell that requires a data entry, type in 
the necessary data, and then press Tab or the Enter key to advance to the 
next blank cell (either over or down, depending on the template’s design). If 
pressing Tab or Enter takes you past a blank cell in the worksheet that needs 
data, simply click the cell, type in the data, and then press Enter to complete 
the entry and advance to the next blank.
Note that when filling in a spreadsheet generated from one of these sample 
templates, you have access to all the cells in the worksheet: those that con-
tain standard headings as well as those that require personalized data entry.
After you finish filling in the personalized data, save the workbook just as you 
would a workbook that you had created from scratch (see the “Saving the 
Data” section at the end of this chapter for details on saving workbook files).

You can customize these templates to make them easier to fill out and then 
save those modifications in a new template that you save on disk. For exam-
ple, you can make your own custom billing template from one generated by 
the Billing Statement template by filling in your company name and address 
in the top section and your billing terms and a thank-you message in the 
bottom sections.
Saving changes to your customized templates
To save your changes as a new template file, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar (the one with 
the disk icon), click File➪Save on the File pull-down menu, or press 
Ctrl+S.
 
 Following any one of these methods opens the Save As dialog box, 
where the temporary filename (such as BillingStatement1) appears in 
the File Name text box.
 
2. Edit the filename for your new template in the File Name text box.
 
 Next, you need to change the file type from a regular Microsoft Excel 
Workbook to a Template in the Save as Type drop-down list box.

Book II
Chapter 1

Designer Spreadsheets
 
3. Click the Save as Type drop-down button and then click Excel 
Template in the drop-down menu.
 
 If you need your new template file to be compatible with earlier versions 
of Excel (versions 97 through 2003), click Excel 97-2003 Template rather 
than Excel Template on the Save as Type drop-down list. When you do 
this, Excel saves the new template file in the older binary file format 
(rather than the new XML file format) with the old .xlt filename exten-
sion instead of the new .xltx filename extension. If your template con-
tains macros that you want the user to be able to run when creating the 
worksheet, click Excel Macro-Enabled Template.
 
 Note that Excel automatically selects the Templates folder (indicated 
by the appearance of Templates in the address bar of the Save As dialog 
box on Windows 7 and Vista and in the Save In combo box on Windows 
XP) as the place to save your template. All spreadsheet template files 
that you save in this folder automatically appear.
 
4. Click the Save button to close the Save As dialog box and save your 
customized template in the Templates folder.
 
 After the Save As dialog box closes, you still need to close the custom-
ized template file in the Excel work area.
 
5. Click File➪Close or press Alt+FC or Ctrl+W to close the customized 
template file.
After saving the customized template file in the Template folder, you 
can generate new workbooks from it by simply opening the Available 
Templates pane in the Backstage view and then clicking the My Templates 
button. Excel then opens the New dialog box with a Personal Templates 
tab showing all the template files you’ve saved in your Templates folder. 
The file icon for the customized template appears on this tab of the New 
dialog box. To generate a new workbook from the customized spreadsheet 
template, double-click this template file icon or, if you prefer, click the icon 
and then click OK.
Figure 1-3 shows a new Billing Statement worksheet file in Excel created from 
the original Billing Statement template after customizing a copy of it for my 
company, Mind Over Media, Inc.
To open this worksheet, all I had to do was double-click its template file 
icon on the Personal Templates tab of the New dialog box (opened by click-
ing the My Templates button in the Available Templates panel in the Excel 
Backstage view — File➪New or Alt+FN).

Downloading Microsoft spreadsheet templates
If you have Internet access, you can easily check out and download any 
of the spreadsheet templates offered by Microsoft directly from the New 
Workbook dialog box.
Simply click the category of the template you want to download featured 
in the Microsoft Office Templates section of Available Template panel in 
the Excel Backstage view. When you click a category button (Budgets, 
Calendars, Faxes, Forms, Invoices, or Minutes), Excel then displays fold-
ers with particular types of templates in the category or, if there’s only one 
folder, a list of all the online templates in that category with a thumbnail pre-
view image of the currently selected template in that category.
Figure 1-4 shows the Available Templates panel in the Excel Backstage view 
after selecting Budgets in the Office.com Templates section and then pre-
viewing the Expense Budget template by clicking its icon in the listing of the 
available Budget templates.
 
If you can’t locate the type of template you want to use in any of the 
categories folders listed in the Available Templates pane, click the More 
Categories folder button. Excel then displays a list of folders for the various 

Book II

Designer Spreadsheets
subcategories (Address Books through Other Templates) in the Available 
Templates panel. When you locate the kind of template you need in this list, 
click its subcategory folder name. Excel then replaces the subcategory list 
with a list of actual templates in that subcategory.
 
Figure 1-4:

template to 
download 
from 
Microsoft 
Office.com.
 
When you find the template you want to download, click its icon if it’s not 
already selected and then click the Download button that appears under 
its preview on the right side of the Available Templates panel to have Excel 
begin downloading it.
After Excel finishes downloading the template, the program automatically 
opens a new worksheet from that template in the Excel Worksheet area. 
You can then customize the worksheet(s) in this workbook and save your 
changes (Ctrl+S) as you would a spreadsheet that you created from scratch.
 
Keep in mind that after downloading a template from Microsoft Office 
Online, you can use the template to generate new workbooks by opening it 
from the Personal Templates tab of the New dialog box (open this dialog box 
by clicking the My Templates button in the Available Templates panel in the 
Excel Backstage view — File➪New or Alt+FN).

90
Designer Spreadsheets
 
If you know the type of template you want to find on the Microsoft Office.
com site, you can do a search for it from the New Workbook dialog box. 
Simply click the Search Office.com for Templates text box near the top of the 
Available Templates panel, and then enter the type of templates to locate 
before you click the Start Searching button on the right (the one with the 
arrow pointing to the right). Excel then searches the Microsoft Office.com 
Web site for all templates fitting your search terms and displays their 
thumbnails in the center column of the dialog box, where you can select and 
download them as you would any of the templates you find by selecting their 
category or subcategory.
Creating your own spreadsheet templates
You certainly don’t have to rely on spreadsheet templates created by other 
people. Indeed, many times you simply can’t do this because, even though 
other people may generate the type of spreadsheet that you need, their 
design doesn’t incorporate and represent the data in the manner that you 
prefer or that your company or clients require.
When you can’t find a ready-made template that fits the bill or that you can 
easily customize to suit your needs, create your own templates from sample 
workbooks that you’ve created or that your company has on hand. The easi-
est way to create your own template is to first create an actual workbook 
prototype, complete with all the text, data, formulas, graphics, and macros 
that it requires to function.
When readying the prototype workbook, make sure that you remove all 
headings, miscellaneous text, and numbers that are specific to the prototype 
and not generic enough to appear in the spreadsheet template. You may also 
want to protect all generic data, including the formulas that calculate the 
values that you or your users input into the worksheets generated from the 
template and headings that never require editing (see Book IV, Chapter 1 for 
information on how to protect certain parts of a worksheet from changes).
After making sure that both the layout and content of the boilerplate data 
are hunky-dory, save the workbook in the template file format (.xltx) in the 
Templates folder so that you can then generate new workbooks from it by 
opening it on the Personal Templates tab of the New dialog box (for details 
on how to do this, refer back to the steps in the previous section, “Saving 
changes to your customized templates”).
As you may have noticed when looking through the sample templates 
included in Excel (see Figure 1-2, for example) or browsing through the 
templates available on the Microsoft Office.com Web site, many spread-
sheet templates abandon the familiar worksheet grid of cells, preferring a 
look very close to that of a paper form instead. When converting a sample 
workbook into a template, you can also remove the grid, use cell borders to 

Book II
Chapter 1
Building 
Worksheets
91
Designer Spreadsheets
underscore or outline key groups of cells, and color different cell groups to 
make them stand out (for information on how to do this kind of stuff, refer to 
Book II, Chapter 2).
 
Keep in mind that you can add online comments to parts of the template 
that instruct coworkers on how to properly fill in and save the data. These 
comments are helpful if your coworkers are unfamiliar with the template 
and may be less skilled in using Excel (see Book IV, Chapter 3, for details on 
adding comments to worksheets).
Designing a workbook from scratch
Not all worksheets come from templates. Many times, you need to create 
rather unique spreadsheets that aren’t intended to function as standard 
models from which certain types of workbooks are generated. In fact, most 
of the spreadsheets that you create in Excel may be of this kind, especially if 
your business doesn’t rely on the use of highly standardized financial state-
ments and forms.
Planning your workbook
When creating a new workbook from scratch, you need to start by consider-
ing the layout and design of the data. When doing this mental planning, you 
may want to ask yourself some of the following questions:
 
✦ Does the layout of the spreadsheet require the use of data tables (with 
both column and row headings) or lists (with column headings only)?
 
✦ Do these data tables and lists need to be laid out on a single worksheet 
or can they be placed in the same relative position on multiple work-
sheets of the workbook (like pages of a book)?
 
✦ Do the data tables in the spreadsheet use the same type of formulas?
 
✦ Do some of the columns in the data lists in the spreadsheet get their 
input from formula calculation or do they get their input from other lists 
(called lookup tables) in the workbook?
 
✦ Will any of the data in the spreadsheet be graphed, and will these charts 
appear in the same worksheet (referred to as embedded charts), or 
will they appear on separate worksheets in the workbook (called chart 
sheets)?
 
✦ Does any of the data in the spreadsheet come from worksheets in sepa-
rate workbook files?
 
✦ How often will the data in the spreadsheet be updated or added to?
 
✦ How much data will the spreadsheet ultimately hold?
 
✦ Will the data in the spreadsheet be shared primarily in printed or online 
form?

92
Designer Spreadsheets
All these questions are an attempt to get you to consider the basic purpose 
and function of the new spreadsheet before you start building it, so that you 
can come up with a design that is both economical and fully functional.

Economy is an important consideration because when you open a work-
book, all its data is loaded into your computer’s dynamic memory (known 
simply as memory). This may not pose any problems if your computer is one 
of the latest generation of PCs with more memory than you can conceive of 
using at one time, but it can pose quite a problem if you share the workbook 
file with someone whose computer is not so well equipped. Also, depending 
on just how much data you cram into the workbook, you may even come to 
see Excel creep and crawl the more you work with it.
To help guard against this problem, make sure that you don’t pad the data 
tables and lists in your workbook with extra empty “spacer” cells. Keep the 
tables as close together as possible on the same worksheet (with no more 
than a single blank column or row as a separator, which you can adjust to 
make as wide or high as you like), or — if the design allows — keep them in 
the same region of consecutive worksheets.
Functionality
Along with economy, you must pay attention to the functionality of the 
spreadsheet. This means that you need to allow for future growth when 
selecting the placement of its data tables, lists, and charts. This is especially 
important in the case of data lists because they have a tendency to grow 
longer and longer as you continue to add data, requiring more and more 
rows of the same few columns in the worksheet. This means that you should 
usually consider all the rows of the columns used in a data list as “off limits.” 
In fact, always position charts and other supporting tables to the right of 
the list rather than somewhere below the last used row. This way, you can 
continue to add data to your list without ever having to stop and first move 
some unrelated element out of the way.
This spatial concern is not the same when placing a data table that will total 
the values both down the rows and across the columns table — for example, 
a sales table that sums your monthly sales by item with formulas that cal-
culate monthly totals in the last row of the table and formulas that calculate 
item totals in the last column. In this table, you don’t worry about having to 
move other elements, such as embedded charts or other supporting or unre-
lated data tables because you use Excel’s capability of expanding the rows 
and columns of the table from within. As the table expands or contracts, sur-
rounding elements move in relation to and with the table expansion and con-
traction. You do this kind of editing to the table because inserting new table 
rows and columns ahead of the formulas ensures that they can be included 

Book II

in the totaling calculations. In this way, the row and column of formulas in 
the data table acts as a boundary that floats with the expansion or contrac-
tion of its data but that keeps all other elements at bay.
Finalizing your workbook design
After you’ve more or less planned out where everything goes in your new 
spreadsheet, you’re ready to start establishing the new tables and lists. Here 
are a few general pointers on how to set up a new data table that includes 
simple totaling calculations:
 
✦ Enter the title of the data table in the first cell, which forms the left and 
top edges of the table.
 
✦ Enter the row of column headings in the row below this cell, starting in 
the same column as the cell with the title of the table.
 
✦ Enter the row headings down the first column of the table, starting in 
the first row that will contain data (doing this leaves a blank cell where 
the column of row headings intersects the row of column headings).
 
✦ Construct the first formula that sums columns of (still empty) cell 
entries in the last row of the table, and then copy that formula across all 
the rest of the table columns.
 
✦ Construct the first formula that sums the rows of (still empty) cell 
entries in the last column of the table, and then copy that formula down 
the rest of the table rows.
 
✦ Format the cells to hold the table values and then enter them in their 
cells, or enter the values to be calculated and then format their cells 
(this is really your choice).
When setting up a new data list in a new worksheet, enter the list name in 
the first cell of the table, and then enter the row of column headings in the 
row below. Then, enter the first row of data beneath the appropriate column 
headings (see Book VI, Chapter 1, for details on designing a data list and 
inputting data into it).
Generating a new workbook from another workbook
In the top part of the Available Templates panel, you find a New from 
Existing button. You can click this button to open a copy of an existing work-
book that you want to modify and then save as a new workbook. Use New 
from Existing when you have access to an existing workbook that contains a 
spreadsheet, which is very similar to the spreadsheet that you now need to 
build, and modifying the data in the original workbook would be faster than 
copying extensive sections of the original data into a blank workbook.

94
Designer Spreadsheets
When you click the New from Existing button, Excel opens the New from 
Existing Workbook dialog box, where you select the original Excel work-
book that you want to modify. After selecting its file icon and then clicking 
the Create New button, Excel opens a copy of the original file (indicated by 
adding a number to the original filename) that you can then safely modify to 
your heart’s content without any danger of corrupting the original.
 
Please don’t open the original workbook and start making modifications to 
its spreadsheet with the intention of then using the File➪Save As (Alt+FS) 
command to save your changes in a copy of the original file. It’s just far too 
easy to select the File➪Save command by mistake and thereby save your 
changes in the original workbook. Always play it safe and use the New from 
Existing button in the Available Templates panel in the Excel Backstage view 
instead.
Opening new blank workbooks
Although Excel automatically opens a new workbook (called Book1 when 
you first start the program) that you can use in building a new spreadsheet 
from scratch, you will encounter occasions in using Excel when you need to 
open your own blank workbook. For example, if you launch Excel by open-
ing an existing workbook that needs editing and then move on to building a 
new spreadsheet, you’ll need to open a blank workbook (which you can do 
before or after closing the workbook with which you started Excel).
The easiest way to open a blank workbook is to press Ctrl+N. Excel responds 
by opening a new workbook, which is given a generic Book name with the 
next unused number (Book2, if you opened Excel with a blank Book1). 
You can also do the same thing in the Excel Backstage view by choosing 
File➪New and then clicking the Create button.
As soon as you open a blank workbook, Excel makes its document window 
active. To then return to another workbook that you have open (which you 
would do if you wanted to copy and paste some of its data into one of the 
blank worksheets), click its button on the Windows taskbar or press Alt+Tab 
until its file icon is selected in the dialog box that appears in the middle of 
the screen.
 
If you ever open a blank workbook by mistake, you can just close it right 
away by pressing Ctrl+W, clicking File➪Close, or pressing Alt+FC. Excel then 
closes its document window and automatically returns you to the workbook 
window that was originally open at the time you mistakenly opened the 
blank workbook.

It Takes All Kinds (Of Cell Entries)
It Takes All Kinds (Of Cell Entries)
Before covering the many methods for getting data into the cells of your new 
spreadsheet, you need to understand which type of data that you’re enter-
ing. To Excel, everything that you enter in any worksheet cell is either one of 
two types of data: text (also known as a label) or a number (also known as a 
value or numeric entry).
The reason that you should care about what type of data you’re entering 
into the cells of your worksheet is that Excel treats your entry differently, 
depending on what type of data it thinks you’ve entered.
 
✦ Text entries are automatically left-aligned in their cells, and if they consist 
of more characters than fit within the column’s current width, the extra 
characters spill over and are displayed in blank cells in columns on the 
right (if these cells are not blank, Excel cuts off the display of any charac-
ters that don’t fit within the cell borders until you widen its column).
 
✦ Numbers are automatically right-aligned in their cells, and if they con-
sist of more characters (including numbers and any formatting char-
acters that you add) than fit within the column’s current width, Excel 
displays a string of number signs across the cell (######), telling you to 
widen the column (in some cases, such as decimal numbers, Excel will 
truncate the decimal places shown in the cell instead of displaying the 
number-sign overflow indicators).
So, now all you have to know is how Excel differentiates text data entries 
from numeric data entries.
What’s in a label?
Here’s the deal with text entries:
 
✦ All data entries beginning with a letter of the alphabet or a punctuation 
mark are considered text.
 
✦ All data entries that mix letters (A–Z) and numbers are considered text, 
even when the entry begins with a number.
 
✦ All numeric data entries that contain punctuation other than commas 
(,), periods (.), and forward slashes (/) are considered text, even when 
they begin with a number.
This means that in addition to regular text, such as First Quarter Earnings and 
John Smith, nonstandard data entries, including C123, 666-45-0034, and 123C, 
are also considered text entries.

96
It Takes All Kinds (Of Cell Entries)
However, a problem exists with numbers that are separated by hyphens 
(also known as dashes): If the numbers that are separated by dashes corre-
spond to a valid date, Excel converts it into a date (which is most definitely 
a kind of numeric data entry — see the “Dates and times” section in this 
chapter for details). For example, if you enter 1-2-11 in a cell, Excel thinks 
that you want to enter the date January 2, 2011, in the cell, and the program 
automatically converts the entry into a date number (displayed as 1/2/2011 
in the cell).
 
If you want to enter a number as text in a cell, you must preface its first digit 
with an apostrophe (’). For example, if you’re entering a part number that 
consists of all numbers, such as 12-30-09, and you don’t want Excel to con-
vert it into the date December 30, 2009, you need to preface the entry with 
an apostrophe by entering into the cell:
‘12-30-09
Likewise, if you want to enter 3/4 in a cell, meaning three out of four rather 
than the date March 4, you enter
‘3/4
(Note that if you want to designate the fraction, three-fourths, you need to 
input =3/4, in which case Excel displays the value 0.75 in the cell display.)
When you complete an entry that starts with an apostrophe, the apostrophe 
is not displayed in the cell (it does appear, however, on the Formula bar). 
Instead, a tiny green triangle appears in the upper-left corner of the cell, and 
an alert symbol appears to the immediate left (as long as the cell cursor is 
in this cell). When you position the mouse pointer on this alert indicator, a 
drop-down button appears to its right (shown in the left margin). When you 
click this drop-down button, a drop-down menu similar to the one shown 
in Figure 1-5 appears. In this example, the first option indicates that the 
number is currently stored as text, and the second option enables you to 
convert it back into a number (by removing the apostrophe).
 
If you start a cell entry with the equal sign (=) or the at symbol (@) followed 
by other characters that aren’t part of a formula, Excel displays an error 
dialog box as soon as you try to complete the data entry. Excel uses the 
equal sign to indicate the use of a formula, and what you have entered is 
not a valid formula. The program knows that Lotus 1-2-3 used the @ symbol 
to indicate the use of a built-in function, and what you have entered is not 
a valid built-in function. This means that you must preface any data entry 
beginning with the equal sign and at symbol that isn’t a valid formula with an 
apostrophe in order to get it into the cell.

What’s the value?
In a typical spreadsheet, numbers (or numeric data entries) can be as 
prevalent as the text entries — if not more so. This is because traditionally, 
spreadsheets were developed to keep financial records, which included 
plenty of extended item totals, subtotals, averages, percentages, and grand 
totals. Of course, you can create spreadsheets that are full of numbers that 
have nothing to do with debits, credits, income statements, invoices, quar-
terly sales, and dollars and cents.
Number entries that you make in your spreadsheet can be divided into three 
categories:
 
✦ Numbers that you input directly into a cell. (You can do this with the 
keyboard, your voice if you use the Speech Recognition feature, or even 
by handwriting if your keyboard is equipped with a writing tablet.)
 
✦ Date and time numbers that are also input directly into a cell but are 
automatically displayed with the default Date and Time number formats 
and are stored behind the scenes as special date serial and hour decimal 
numbers.
 
✦ Numbers calculated by formulas that you build yourself by using simple 
arithmetical operators and/or Excel’s sophisticated built-in functions.

98
It Takes All Kinds (Of Cell Entries)
Inputting numbers
Numbers that you input directly into the cells of the worksheet — whether 
they are positive, negative, percentages, or decimal values representing 
dollars and cents, widgets in stock, workers in the Human Resources depart-
ment, or potential clients — don’t change unless you specifically change 
them, either by editing their values or replacing them with other values. This 
is quite unlike formulas with values that change whenever the worksheet is 
recalculated and Excel finds that the values upon which they depend have 
been modified.
When inputting numbers, you can mix the digits 0–9 with the following key-
board characters:
+ – () $ . , %
You use these characters in the numbers you input as follows:
 
✦ Preface the digits of the number with a plus sign (+) when you want 
to explicitly designate the number as positive, as in +(53) to convert 
negative 53 into positive 53. Excel considers all numbers to be positive 
unless you designate them as negative.
 
✦ Preface the digits of the number with – or enclose them in a pair of 
parentheses to indicate that the number is a negative number, as in –53 
or (53).
 
✦ Preface the digits of the number with a dollar sign ($), as in $500, to 
format the number with the Currency style format as you enter it (you 
can also apply this format after it’s entered).
 
✦ Input a period (.) in the digits of the number to indicate the position of the 
decimal point in the number, as in 500.25. (Note that you don’t have to 
bother entering trailing zeros after the decimal point because the General 
number format automatically drops them, even if you type them in.)
 
✦ Input commas (,) between the digits of a number to indicate the position 
of thousands, hundred thousands, millions, billions, and the like, and 
to assign the Comma style number format to the number, as in 642,153. 
(You can also have Excel add the commas by assigning the Comma 
format to the number after you input the number.)
 
✦ Append the percent sign (%) to the digits of a number to convert the 
number into a percentage and assign the Percent number style to it, as 
in 12%.
The most important thing to remember about the numbers that you input is 
that they inherit the type of number formatting currently assigned to the cells 
in which they’re entered. When you first open a blank workbook, the number 
format appropriately called General (which some have called the equivalent 
of no number formatting because it doesn’t add any special format characters, 

Book II
Chapter 1
Building 
Worksheets
99
It Takes All Kinds (Of Cell Entries)
such as a constant number of decimal places or thousands separators) is 
applied to each cell of the worksheet. You can override the General format 
by adding your own formatting characters as you input the number in a cell 
or, later, by selecting the cell and then assigning a different number format 
to it (see Book II, Chapter 2 for details).
Dates and times
Excel stores dates and times that you input into a spreadsheet as special 
values. Dates are stored as serial numbers and times are stored as decimal 
fractions. Excel supports two date systems: the 1900 date system used by 
Excel for Windows (also used by Lotus 1-2-3), which uses January 1, 1900, as 
serial number 1, and the 1904 system used by Excel for the Macintosh, which 
uses January 2, 1904, as serial number 1.
 
If you use Excel on the IBM-compatible PCs and Macintosh computers in 
your office, you can switch from the default 1900 date system to the 1904 
date system for those worksheets that you create in the Windows version 
and then transfer to the Macintosh version. To switch to the 1904 date 
system, click the Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog box (File➪Excel 
Options or Alt+FI) and then click the Use 1904 Date System check box in the 
When Calculating This Workbook section.
By storing dates as serial numbers representing the number of days that 
have elapsed from a particular date (January 1, 1900, or January 2, 1904), 
Excel can perform arithmetic between dates. For example, you can find out 
how many days there are between February 15, 1949, and February 15, 2009, 
by entering 2/15/09 in one cell and 2/15/49 in the cell below, and then creat-
ing a formula in the cell below that one that subtracts the cell with 2/15/49 
from the one containing 2/15/09. Because Excel stores the date 2/15/09 as 
the serial number 39859 and the date 2/15/49 as the serial number 17944, it 
can calculate the difference and return the result of 21915 (days, which is 
equal to 60 years).
 
When you type a date directly into a formula that performs date arithmetic 
(as opposed to constructing a formula using references to cells that contain 
date entries), you must enclose the date in quotation marks. So, for example, 
if you type the dates in a formula that calculates the number of days 
between February 15, 1949, and February 15, 2010, in the cell you have to 
type the following formula:
=”2/15/10”–”2/15/49”
Times of the day are stored as decimal numbers that represent the fraction 
of the 24-hour period starting with 0.0 for 12:00 midnight through 0.999 for 
11:59:59 p.m. By storing times as decimal fractions, Excel enables you to 
perform time calculations such as those that return the elapsed time (in min-
utes) between any two times of the day.

Inputting dates and times using recognized formats
Although Excel stores dates as serial numbers and times as decimal frac-
tions, luckily you don’t have to use these numbers to enter dates or times 
of the day into cells of the worksheet. You simply enter dates by using any 
of the recognized Date number formats that are used by Excel, and you 
enter times by using any of the recognized Time number formats. Excel then 
assigns and stores the appropriate serial number or decimal fraction at the 
same time the program assigns the date or time format that you used for this 
value. Table 1-1 shows you typical date and time entries that you can use as 
examples when entering dates and times in the cells of a worksheet.

Understanding how Excel treats two-digit years
The only thing that’s a tad bit tricky about inputting dates in a spreadsheet 
comes in knowing when you have to input all four digits of the year and 
when you can get away with entering only two. As Table 1-1 shows, if you 
input the date 1/6/11 in a cell, Excel recognizes the date as 1/6/2011 and not 
as 1/6/1911. In fact, if you enter the date January 6, 1911, in a spreadsheet, 
you must enter all four digits of the year (1911).
Here’s how Excel decides whether a year for which you enter only the last 
two digits belongs to the 20th or 21st century:
 
✦ 00 through 29 belong to the 21st century, so Excels interprets 7/30/29 as 
July 30, 2029.
 
✦ 30 through 99 belong to the 20th century, so Excel interprets 7/30/30 as 
July 30, 1930.

Book II
Chapter 1
Building 
Worksheets
101
Data Entry 101
This means that you don’t have to enter the four digits of the year for dates 
in the years 2000 through 2029 or for dates in the years 1930 through 1999.
 
Of course, if you can’t remember these cutoffs and are just generally con-
fused about when to enter two digits versus four digits, just go ahead and 
enter all four digits of the year. Excel never misunderstands which century 
the date belongs to when you spell out all four digits of the year.
Numeric formulas
Many numeric entries in a typical spreadsheet are not input directly but are 
returned as the result of a calculation by a formula. The numeric formulas 
that you build can do anything from simple arithmetic calculations to com-
plex ANOVA statistical analyses (see Book III for complete coverage of all 
types of numeric formulas). Most spreadsheet formulas use numbers that 
are input into other cells of the worksheet in their calculations. Because 
these formulas refer to the address of the cell containing the input number 
rather than the number itself, Excel is able to automatically recalculate the 
formula and return a new result anytime you change the values in the origi-
nal cell.
The most important thing to remember about numeric formulas is that their 
calculated values are displayed in their cells in the worksheet, whereas the 
contents of the formulas (that indicate how the calculation is done) are 
displayed on the Formula bar whenever its cell contains the cell cursor. 
All numbers returned by formulas inherit the nondescript General number 
format. The only way to get these calculated numbers to appear the way you 
want them in the worksheet is to select them and apply a new, more appro-
priate number format to them (see Book II, Chapter 2 for details).
Data Entry 101
I want to pass on to you a few basic rules of data entry:
 
✦ You must select the cell where you want to make the data entry before 
you can make the entry in that cell.
 
✦ Any entry that you make in a cell that already contains data replaces the 
original entry.
 
✦ Every data entry that you make in any cell must be completed with some 
sort of action, such as clicking the Enter button on the Formula bar (the 
button with the check mark that appears when you start entering data), 
pressing the Enter key, or clicking a new cell before the entry is officially 
entered in that cell.
I know that the first rule sounds so obvious that it should go without saying, 
but you’d be surprised how many times you look at the cell where you intend 
to add new data and then just start entering that data without realizing that 

102
Data Entry 101
you haven’t yet moved the cell cursor to that cell. As a result, the data entry 
that you’re making is not destined to go into the cell that you intended. In fact, 
you’re in the process of making the entry in whatever cell currently contains 
the cell cursor, and if that cell is already occupied, you’re in the process of 
replacing its entry with the one you meant to go somewhere else!
 
This is where the third rule is so important: Even if you’re in the process 
of messing up your spreadsheet by entering data in the wrong cell (and, if 
that cell is occupied, you’re destroying a perfectly good entry), you haven’t 
done it until you take the action that completes the entry (such as clicking 
the Enter button on the Formula bar or pressing the Enter key). This means 
that you can recover simply by clicking the Cancel button on the Formula 
bar or by pressing the Escape key on your keyboard. As soon as you do that, 
the errant data entry disappears from the Formula bar (and the original data 
entry — if it exists — returns), and you’re then free to move the cell cursor 
to the desired cell and redo the entry there.
Data entry keyboard style
The only trick to entering data from the keyboard is to figure out the most 
efficient way to complete the entry in the current cell (and Excel gives you 
many choices in this regard). You can, of course, complete any data entry 
by clicking the Enter button on the Formula bar (presumably this is what 
Microsoft intended; otherwise, why have the button?), but clicking this 
button is not at all efficient when the mouse pointer isn’t close to it.
You should know of another potential drawback to clicking the Enter button 
on the Formula bar to complete an entry: When you do this, Excel doesn’t 
move the cell cursor but keeps it right in the cell with the new data entry. 
This means that you still have to move the cell cursor before you can safely 
make your next data entry. You’re better off then pressing the Enter key 
because doing this not only completes the entry in the cell, but also moves 
the cell cursor down the cell in the next row.
Of course, pressing the Enter key is efficient only if you’re doing the data 
entry for a table or list down each row across the succeeding columns. If you 
want to enter the data across each column of the table or list down succeed-
ing rows, pressing Enter doesn’t work to your advantage. Instead, you’d be 
better off pressing the → key or the Tab key to complete each entry (at least 
until you get to the cell in the last column of the table) because pressing 
these keys completes the entry and moves the cell cursor to the next cell on 
the right.
Take a look at Table 1-2 to get an idea of the keys that you commonly use 
to complete data entries. Keep in mind, however, that any key combination 
that moves the cell cursor (see Table 1-1 in Book I, Chapter 1, for a review of 
these keystrokes) also completes the data entry that you’re making, as does 
clicking another cell in the worksheet.

If you have more than one cell selected (see Book II, Chapter 2 for more 
on this) and then press Ctrl+Enter to complete the data entry that you’re 
making in the active cell of this selected range, Excel simultaneously enters 
that data entry into all the cells in the selection. You can use this technique 
to enter a single label or value in many places in a worksheet at one time.
If you have more than one worksheet selected (see Book II, Chapter 4) at the 
time that you make an entry in the current cell, Excel makes that entry in the 
corresponding cells of all the selected worksheets. For example, if you enter 
the heading Cost Analysis in cell C3 of Sheet1 when Sheet1 through Sheet3 are 
selected, Excel enters Cost Analysis in cell C3 of Sheet2 and Sheet3 as well.
You AutoComplete this for me
Excel automatically makes use of a feature called AutoComplete, which 
attempts to automate completely textual data entries (that is, entries that 
don’t mix text and numbers). AutoComplete works this way: If you start a 
new text entry that begins with the same letter or letters as an entry that 
you’ve made recently in the same region of the worksheet, Excel completes 
the new text entry with the characters from the previous text entry that 
began with those letters.
For example, if you type the spreadsheet title Sales Invoice in cell A1 of a 
new worksheet and then, after completing the entry by pressing the ↓, start 
entering the table title Summary in cell A2, as soon as you type S in cell A2, 
Excel completes the new text entry so that it also states Sales Invoice by 
adding the letters ales Invoice.
When the AutoComplete feature completes the new text entry, the letters 
that it adds to the initial letter or letters that you type are automatically 
selected (indicated by highlighting). This way, if you don’t want to repeat 

104
Data Entry 101
the original text entry in the new cell, you can replace the characters that 
Excel adds just by typing the next letter in the new (and different) entry. In 
the previous example, in which Sales Invoice was repeated in the cell where 
you want to input Summary, the ales Invoice text appended to the S that you 
type disappears the moment you type u in Summary.
Note that when you have two different entries that begin with the same first 
letter but have different second letters, typing the second letter of one entry 
causes Excel to complete the typing of that entry, leaving you free to insert 
its text in the cell by pressing the Enter key or using any of the other meth-
ods for completing a cell entry.
To make use of automatic text completion rather than override it as in the 
previous example, simply press a key (such as Enter or an arrow key), click 
the Enter button on the Formula bar, or click another cell to complete the 
completed input in that cell. For example, say you’re building a sales table in 
which you’re inputting sales for three different account representatives — 
George, Jean, and Alice. After entering each name manually in the appropriate 
row of the Account Representative column, you only need to type in their 
first initial (G to get George, J to get Jean, and A to get Alice) in subsequent 
cells and then press the ↓ or Enter key to move down to the next row of that 
column. Of course, in a case like this, AutoComplete is more like automatic 
typing, and it makes filling in the Account Representative names for this table 
extremely quick and easy.
 
If the AutoComplete feature starts to bug you when building a particu-
lar spreadsheet, you can temporarily turn it off; simply click the Enable 
AutoComplete for Cell Values check box, and remove the check mark on the 
Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog box (File➪Options or Alt+FI).
You AutoCorrect this right now!
Along with AutoComplete, Excel has an AutoCorrect feature that automati-
cally fixes certain typos that you make in the text entries as soon as you 
complete them. For example, if you forget to capitalize a day of the week, 
AutoCorrect does this for you (turning friday into Friday in a cell as soon as 
you complete the entry). Likewise, if you mistakenly enter a word with two 
initial capital letters, AutoCorrect automatically lowercases the second capi-
tal letter (so that QUarter typed into a cell becomes Quarter upon completion 
of the cell entry).
In addition to these types of obvious capitalization errors, AutoCorrect also 
automatically takes care of common typos, such as changing hsi to his (an 
obvious transposition of two letters) or inthe to in the (an obvious case of a 
missing space between letters). In addition to the errors already recognized 
by AutoCorrect, you can add your own particular mistakes to the list of auto-
matic replacements.

To do this, open the AutoCorrect dialog box and then add your own replace-
ments in the Replace and With text boxes located on the AutoCorrect tab, 
shown in Figure 1-6. Here’s how:
 
1. Click File➪Options or press Alt+FI, and then click the Proofing tab fol-
lowed by the AutoCorrect Options button.
 
 The AutoCorrect dialog box opens for your language, such as English 
(U.S.).
 
2. If the AutoCorrect options aren’t already displayed in the dialog box, 
click the AutoCorrect tab to display them.
 
3. Click the Replace text box and then enter the typo exactly as you usu-
ally make it.
 
4. Click the With text box and enter the replacement that AutoCorrect 
should make (with no typos in it, please!).
 
 Check the typo that you’ve entered in the Replace text box and the 
replacement that you’ve entered in the With text box. If everything 
checks out, go on to Step 5.
 
5. Click the Add button to add your new AutoCorrect replacement to the 
list of automated replacements.
 
6. Click the OK button to close the AutoCorrect dialog box.
 
Figure 1-6: 
You can add 
your own

replace-
ments to the 
AutoCorrect 
tab.
 
 
You can use the AutoCorrect feature to automatically replace favorite abbre-
viations with full text, as well as to clean up all your personal typing mis-
takes. For example, if you have a client with the name Great Lakes Securities, 
and you enter this client’s name in countless spreadsheets that you create, 
you can make an AutoCorrect entry so that Excel automatically replaces 
the abbreviation gls with Great Lakes Securities. Of course, after you use 
AutoCorrect to enter Great Lakes Securities in your first cell by typing gls, 

106
Data Entry 101
the AutoComplete feature kicks in, so the next time you type the g of gls to 
enter the client’s name in another cell, it fills in the rest of the name, leaving 
you with nothing to do but complete the entry.
 
Keep in mind that AutoCorrect is not a replacement for Excel’s spelling 
checker. You should still spell check your spreadsheet before sending it out 
because the spelling checker finds all those uncommon typos that haven’t 
been automatically corrected for you (see Book II, Chapter 3 for details).
Constraining data entry to a cell range
One of the most efficient ways to enter data into a new table in your spread-
sheet is to preselect the empty cells where the data entries need to be made 
and then enter the data into the selected range. Of course, this trick only 
works if you know ahead of time how many columns and rows the new table 
requires.
The reason that preselecting the cells works so well is that doing this con-
strains the cell cursor to that range, provided that you press only the key-
strokes shown in Table 1-3. This means that if you’re using the Enter key to 
move down the column as you enter data, Excel automatically positions the 
cell cursor at the beginning of the next column as soon as you complete the 
last entry in that column. Likewise, when using the Tab key to move the cell 
cursor across a row as you enter data, Excel automatically positions the cell 
cursor at the beginning of the next row in the table as soon as you complete 
the last entry in that row.
That way you don’t have to concentrate on repositioning the cell cursor at 
all when entering the table data; you can keep your attention on the printed 
copy from which you’re taking the data.

You can’t very well use this preselection method on data lists because 
they’re usually open-ended affairs to which you continually append new 
rows of data. The most efficient way to add new data to a new or existing 
data list is to format it as a table (see Book II, Chapter 2).
Getting Excel to put in the decimal point
Of course, if your keyboard has a ten-key entry pad, you’ll want to use it 
rather than the numbers on the top row of the keyboard to make your 
numeric entries in the spreadsheet (make sure that the Num Lock key is 
engaged, or you’ll end up moving the cell cursor rather than entering num-
bers). If you have a lot of decimal numbers (suppose that you’re building a 
financial spreadsheet with loads of dollars and cents entries), you may also 
want to use Excel’s Fixed Decimal Places feature so that Excel places a deci-
mal point in all the numbers that you enter in the worksheet.
To turn on this feature, click the Automatically Insert a Decimal Point 
check box in the Editing Options section of the Advanced tab of the Excel 
Options dialog box (File➪Options or Alt+FI) to put a check mark in it. 
When you do this, the Places text box immediately below it determines the 
number of decimal places that the program is to add to each number entry. 
You can then specify the number of places by changing its value (2 is, of 
course, the default) either by entering a new value or selecting one with its 
spinner buttons.
After turning on the Automatically Insert a Decimal Point option, Excel adds 
a decimal point to the number of places that you specified to every numeric 
data entry that you make at the time you complete its entry. For example, if 
you type the digits 56789 in a cell, Excel changes this to 567.89 at the time 
you complete the entry.
Note that when this feature is turned on and you want to enter a number 
without a decimal point, you need to type a period at the end of the value. 
For example, if you want to enter the number 56789 in a cell and not have 
Excel change it to 567.89, you need to type
56789.
Ending the number in a period prevents Excel from adding its own decimal 
point to the value when Fixed Decimal Places is turned on. Of course, you 
need to turn this feature off after you finish making the group of entries 
that require the same number of decimal places. To do this, click the 
Automatically Insert a Decimal Point check box on the Advanced tab of the 
Excel Options dialog box (File➪Options or Alt+FI) to remove its check mark.

Data Entry 101
You AutoFill it in
Few Excel features are more helpful than the AutoFill feature, which enables 
you to fill out a series of entries in a data table or list — all by entering only 
the first item in the series in the spreadsheet. You can sometimes use the 
AutoFill feature to quickly input row and column headings for a new data 
table or to number the records in a data list. For example, when you need 
a row of column headings that list the 12 months for a sales table, you can 
enter January or Jan. in the first column and then have AutoFill input the 
other 11 months for you in the cells in columns to the right. Likewise, when 
you need to create a column of row headings at the start of a table with suc-
cessive part numbers that start at L505-120 and proceed to L505-128, you 
enter L505-120 in the first row and then use AutoFill to copy the part num-
bers down to L505-128 in the cells below.
The key to using AutoFill is the Fill handle, which is the small black square 
that appears in the lower-right corner of whatever cell contains the cell 
cursor. When you position the mouse pointer on the Fill handle, it changes 
from the normal thick, white-cross pointer to a thin, black-cross pointer. 
This change in shape is your signal that when you drag the Fill handle in a 
single direction, either down or to the right, Excel will either copy the cur-
rent cell entry to all the cells that you select or use it as the first entry in a 
consecutive series, whose successive entries are then automatically entered 
in the selected cells.
Note that you can immediately tell whether Excel will simply copy the cell 
entry or use it as the first in a series to fill out by the ScreenTips that appear 
to the right of the mouse pointer. As you drag through subsequent cells, the 
ScreenTip indicates which entry will be made if you release the mouse button 
at that point. If the ScreenTip shows the same entry as you drag, you know 
Excel didn’t recognize the entry as part of a consecutive series and is copying 
the entry verbatim. If, instead, the ScreenTips continue to change as you drag 
through cells showing you successive entries for the series, you know that 
Excel has recognized the original entry as part of a consecutive series.
Figures 1-7 and 1-8 illustrate how AutoFill works. In Figure 1-7, I entered 
January as the first column heading in cell B2 (using the Enter button on the 
Formula bar so as to keep the cell cursor in B2, ready for AutoFill). Next, 
I positioned the mouse pointer on the AutoFill handle in the lower-right 
corner of B2 before dragging the Fill handle to the right until I reached cell 
G2 (and the ScreenTip stated June).
Figure 1-8 shows the series that was entered in the cell range B2:G2 when 
I released the mouse button with cell G2 selected. For this figure, I also 
clicked the drop-down button attached to the Auto Fill Options button that 
automatically appears whenever you use the Fill handle to copy entries or

fill in a series to show you the items on this pop-up menu. This menu con-
tains a Copy Cells option button that enables you to override Excel’s deci-
sion to fill in the series and have it copy the original entry (January, in this 
case) to all the selected cells.
 
Figure 1-7:

the Fill 
handle to fill

of the year.
 
Note that you can also override Excel’s natural decision to fill in a series or 
copy an entry before you drag the Fill handle. To do so, simply hold down 
the Ctrl key (which adds a tiny plus sign to the upper-right corner of the Fill 
handle). Continue to depress the Ctrl key as you drag the Fill handle and 
notice that the ScreenTip now shows that Excel is no longer filling in the 
series or copying the entry as expected.
 
When you need to consecutively number the cells in a range, use the Ctrl key 
to override Excel’s natural tendency to copy the number to all the cells you 
select. For example, if you want to number rows of a list, enter the starting 
number (1 or 100, it doesn’t matter) in the first row, then press Ctrl to have 
Excel fill in the rest of the numbers for successive rows in the list (2, 3, 4, 
and the like, or 102, 103, 104, and so on). If you forget to hold down the Ctrl 
key and end up with a whole range of cells with the same starting number, 
click the Auto Fill Options drop-down button and then click the Fill Series 
option button to rectify the mistake by converting the copied numbers to a 
consecutively numbered series.

When using AutoFill to fill in a data series, you don’t have to start with 
the first entry in that particular series. For example, if you want to enter a 
row of column headings with the last six months of the year (June through 
December), you enter June first and then drag down or to the right until the 
mouse pointer selects the cell where you enter December (indicated by the 
December ScreenTip). Note also that you can reverse-enter a data series by 
dragging the Fill handle up or left. In the June-to-December column headings 
example, if you drag up or left, Excel enters June to January in reverse order.
 
Keep in mind that you can also use AutoFill to copy an original formula 
across rows and down columns of data tables and lists. When you drag the 
Fill handle in a cell that contains a formula, Excel automatically adjusts its 
cell references to suit the new row or column position of each copy (see 
Book III, Chapter 1 for details on copying formulas with AutoFill).
Filling series with increments other than one
Normally, when you drag the Fill handle to fill in a series of data entries, 
Excel increases or decreases each entry in the series by a single unit (a day, 
month, hour, or whatever). You can, however, get AutoFill to fill out a series 
of data entries that uses some other increment, such as every other day, 
every third month, or every hour-and-a-half.

Book II
Chapter 1

Data Entry 101
Figure 1-9 illustrates a number of series all created with AutoFill that use 
increments other than one unit. The first example in row 3 shows a series 
of different times all 45 minutes apart, starting with 8:00 a.m. in cell A3 and 
extending to 2:45 p.m. in cell J3. The second example in row 6 shows a series 
of days of the week that uses every other day of the week starting with 
Monday in cell A6 and extending to Saturday in cell G6. The third example in 
row 9 shows a series of numbers, each of which increases by 15, that starts 
with 35 in cell A9 and increases to 170 in cell J9. The last example in row 13 
shows a series with every other month, starting with Jan. in cell A13 and 
extending to Nov. in cell F13.
To create a series that uses an increment other than one unit, follow these 
four general steps:
 
1. Enter the first two entries in the series in consecutive cells above one 
another in a column or side by side in a row.
 
 Enter the entries one above the other when you intend to drag the Fill 
handle down the column to extend the series. Enter them side by side 
when you intend to drag the Fill handle to the right across the row.
 
2. Position the cell cursor in the cell with the first entry in the series, 
and drag through the second entry.

112
Data Entry 101
 
 Both entries must be selected (indicated by being enclosed within 
the expanded cell cursor) before you use the Fill handle to extend the 
series. Excel analyzes the difference between the two entries and uses 
its increment in filling out the data series.
 
3. Drag the Fill handle down the column or across the row to extend the 
series by using the increment other than one unit.
 
 Check the ScreenTips to make sure that Excel is using the correct incre-
ment in filling out your data series.
 
4. Release the mouse button when you reach the desired end of the 
series (indicated by the entry shown in the ScreenTip appearing next 
to the black-cross mouse pointer).
Creating custom AutoFill lists
Just as you can use AutoFill to fill out a series with increments different from 
one unit, you can also get it to fill out custom lists of your own design. For 
example, suppose that you often have to enter a standard series of city loca-
tions as the column or row headings in new spreadsheets that you build. 
Instead of copying the list of cities from one workbook to another, you can 
create a custom list containing all the cities in the order in which they nor-
mally appear in your spreadsheets. After you create a custom list in Excel, 
you can then enter all or part of the entries in the series simply by entering 
the first item in a cell and then using the Fill handle to extend out the series 
either down a column or across a row.
To create a custom series, you can either enter the list of entries in the 
custom series in successive cells of a worksheet before you open the Custom 
Lists dialog box, or you can type the sequence of entries for the custom series 
in the List Entries list box located on the right side of the Custom Lists tab in 
this dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-10.

If you already have the data series for your custom list entered in a range of 
cells somewhere in a worksheet, follow these steps to create the custom list:
 
1. Click the cell with the first entry in the custom series and then drag 
the mouse pointer through the range until all the cells with entries are 
selected.
 
 The expanded cell cursor should now include all the cells with entries 
for the custom list.
 
2. Click File➪Options or press Alt+FI and then click the Edit Custom Lists 
button in the General section on the Advanced tab.
 
 The Custom Lists dialog box opens with its Custom Lists tab, where you 
now should check the accuracy of the cell range listed in the Import List 
from Cells text box. (The range in this box lists the first cell and last cell 
in the current selected range separated by a colon — you can ignore the 
dollar signs following each part of the cell address.) To check that the 
cell range listed in the Import List from Cells text box includes all the 
entries for the custom list, click the Collapse Dialog Box button, located 
to the right of the Import List from Cells text box. When you click this 
button, Excel collapses the Custom Lists dialog box down to the Import 
List from Cells text box and puts a marquee (the so-called marching 
ants) around the cell range.
 
 If this marquee includes all the entries for your custom list, you can 
expand the Custom Lists dialog box by clicking the Expand Dialog box 
button (which replaces the Collapse Dialog Box button) and proceed 
to Step 3. If this marquee doesn’t include all the entries, click the cell 
with the first entry and then drag through until all the other cells are 
enclosed in the marquee. Then, click the Expand Dialog box button and 
go to Step 3.
 
3. Click the Import button to add the entries in the selected cell range 
to the List Entries box on the right and to the Custom Lists box on the 
left side of the Custom Lists tab.
 
 As soon as you click the Import button, Excel adds the data entries in 
the selected cell range to both the List Entries and the Custom Lists 
boxes.
 
4. Click the OK button to close the Custom Lists dialog box.
If you don’t have the entries for your custom list entered anywhere in the 
worksheet, you have to follow the second and third steps listed previously 
and then take these three additional steps instead:
 
1. Click the List Entries box and then type each of the entries for the 
custom list in the order in which they are to be entered in successive 
cells of a worksheet.

114
Data Entry 101
 
 Press the Enter key after typing each entry for the custom list so that 
each entry appears on its own line in the List Entries box, or separate 
each entry with a comma.
 
2. Click the Add button to add the entries that you’ve typed into the List 
Entries box on the right to the Custom Lists box, located on the left 
side of the Custom Lists tab.
 
 Note that when Excel adds the custom list that you just typed to the 
Custom Lists box, it automatically adds commas between each entry 
in the list — even if you pressed the Enter key after making each entry. 
It also automatically separates each entry on a separate line in the List 
Entries box — even if you separated them with commas instead of car-
riage returns.
 
3. Click the OK button to close the Custom Lists dialog box.
After you’ve created a custom list by using one of these two methods, you 
can fill in the entire data series by entering the first entry of the list in a 
cell and then dragging the Fill handle to fill in the rest of the entries. If you 
ever decide that you no longer need a custom list that you’ve created, you 
can delete it by clicking the list in the Custom Lists box in the Custom Lists 
dialog box and then clicking the Delete button. Excel then displays an alert 
box indicating that the list will be permanently deleted when you click OK. 
Note that you can’t delete any of the built-in lists that appear in this list box 
when you first open the Custom Lists dialog box.
 
Keep in mind that you can also fill in any part of the series by simply enter-
ing any one of the entries in the custom list and then dragging the Fill handle 
in the appropriate direction (down and to the right to enter succeeding 
entries in the list or up and to the left to enter preceding entries).
Limiting data entry with Data Validation
The Data Validation feature in Excel can be a real timesaver when you’re 
doing repetitive data entry and can also go a long way in preventing incor-
rect entries in your spreadsheets. When you use Data Validation in a cell, 
you indicate what type of data entry is allowed in the cell. As part of restrict-
ing a data entry to a number (which can be a whole number, decimal, date, 
or time), you also specify the permissible values for that type of number (a 
whole number between 10 and 100 or a date between January 1, 2011, and 
December 31, 2011, for example).
When you restrict the data entry to text, you can specify the range of the 
minimum and maximum text length (in characters), or even better, a list of 
permissible text entries that you can select from a pop-up menu (opened by 
clicking a pop-up button that appears to the right of the cell whenever it con-
tains the cell cursor).

Book II

Data Entry 101
When using Data Validation to restrict the type of data entry and its range 
of acceptable values in a cell, you can also specify an input message that is 
automatically displayed next to the cell when you select it and/or an error 
alert message that is displayed if you try to input the wrong type of entry or 
a number outside the permissible range.
To use the Data Validation feature, put the cell cursor in the cell where 
you want to restrict the type of data entry that you can make there, and 
then click the Data Validation button on the Data tab of the Ribbon (or 
press Alt+AVV). The Data Validation dialog box opens with the Settings tab 
selected (similar to the one shown in Figure 1-11).
You then click the drop-down button attached to the Allow drop-down list 
box and select among the following items:
 
✦ Any Value to remove any previous restrictions thereby canceling data 
validation and once again enabling the user to enter anything he wishes 
into the cell
 
✦ Whole Number to restrict the entry to a whole number that falls within 
a certain range or adheres to particular parameters that you specify
 
✦ Decimal to restrict the entry to a decimal number that falls within a cer-
tain range or adheres to particular parameters that you specify
 
✦ List to restrict the entry to one of several text entries that you specify, 
which you can select from a pop-up menu that’s displayed by clicking a 
pop-up button that appears to the right of the cell whenever it contains 
the cell cursor
 
✦ Date to restrict the entry to a date that falls within a certain range or on 
or before a particular date
 
✦ Time to restrict the entry to a time that falls within a certain range or on 
or before a particular time of the day
 
✦ Text Length to restrict a text entry so that its length in characters 
doesn’t fall below or go above a certain number or falls within a range 
that you specify
 
✦ Custom to restrict the entry to the parameters specified by a particular 
formula entered in another cell of the worksheet
To specify an input message after selecting all the items on the Settings tab, 
click the Input Message tab of the Data Validation dialog box, where you 
enter a short title for the input message (such as How to Proceed) in the Title 
text box, and then enter the text of your message in the Input Message list 
box below.

116
Data Entry 101
To specify an alert message, click the Error Alert tab of the Data Validation 
dialog box, where you can choose the kind of warning in the Style drop-
down list: Stop (the default, which uses a red button with a cross in it), 
Warning (which uses a yellow triangle with an exclamation point in it), and 
Information (which uses a balloon with a blue I in it). After selecting the type 
of alert, you then enter the title for its dialog box in its Title text box, and 
enter the text of the alert message in the Error Message list box.
 
To apply the restriction you’re defining in the Data Validation dialog box 
to all the other cells that are formatted the same way as in a cell range for-
matted as a table (see Book II, Chapter 2 for details), click the Apply These 
Changes to All Other Cells with the Same Settings check box before you click 
OK. To copy the restriction to a range that is not formatted as a table, use 
the Data Validation feature to set up the type of entry and permitted range in 
the first cell and then use the Fill handle to copy that cell’s Data Validation 
settings to subsequent cells in the same column or row.
By far, the most popular use of the Data Validation feature is to create a 
drop-down menu from which you or someone who uses your spreadsheet 
can select the appropriate data entry. Figures 1-11 and 1-12 illustrate this 
type of usage.
As Figure 1-11 shows, on the Settings tab of the Data Validation dialog box, 
I chose List from the Allow drop-down list box and then in the Source text 
box, I designated the cell range J3:J7, which just happens to contain the list 
of allowable entries (you can type them in the Source text box separated by 
commas if the list doesn’t already exist someplace on the worksheet). Notice 
in this figure that, as soon as you select List in the Allow combo box, a check 
box appears. Keep this check box selected because it tells Excel to create 
a drop-down list (or pop-up menu, as it’s also called) containing only the 
entries specified in the Source text box.

cities taken from the cell range J2:J7) as it appears when you click the cell’s

new pop-up button. In this figure, you can also see the input message box 
that I created for this cell by using the options on the Input Message tab of 
the Data Validation dialog box. Note that you can reposition this message 
box (officially known as a comment box) so that it’s close to the cell, but 
doesn’t get in the way of selecting an entry, simply by dragging it with the 
mouse pointer.
Figure 1-13 demonstrates what happens if you try to input an entry that isn’t 
on the drop-down list. For this figure, I deliberately disregarded the input 
instructions and typed Las Vegas as the location. As soon as I clicked the 
Enter button on the Formula bar, the custom alert dialog box (which I named 
Unacceptable Entry) appears. I created this alert dialog box by using the 
options located on the Error Alert tab of the Data Validation dialog box.
To find cells to which Data Validation has been applied, open the Go To 
dialog box (Ctrl+G or F5), and then click the Special button and click the 
Data Validation option button in the Go To Special dialog box. Click the 
Same option button under Data Validation to have Excel go to the next cell 
that uses the same Data Validation settings as the active cell. Leave the All 
option button under Data Validation selected to go to the next cell that uses 
any kind of Data Validation setting.

a spreadsheet, you can also use it to quickly identify values that are outside 
desired parameters in ranges of existing numeric data entries — see Book II,

Saving the Data
One of the most important tasks you ever perform when building your 
spreadsheet is saving your work! Excel offers three different ways to invoke 
the Save command:
 
✦ Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar (the one with the disk 
icon).
 
✦ Press Ctrl+S or F12.
 
✦ Click File➪Save.
 
To encourage frequent saving on your part, Excel provides you with a Save 
button on the Quick Access toolbar (the one with the picture of a floppy 
disk, the very first on the toolbar). You don’t even have to take the time and 
trouble to choose the Save command from the File pull-down menu or even 
press Ctrl+S; you can simply click this tool whenever you want to save new 
work on disk.
When you click the Save button, press Ctrl+S, or click File➪Save for the first 
time, Excel displays the Save As dialog box. Use this dialog box to replace 
the temporary document name (Book1, Book2, and so forth) with a more 
descriptive filename in the File Name text box, to select a new file format in 
the Save As Type drop-down list box, and to select a new drive and folder 
before you save the workbook as a disk file.

Saving the Data
When you finish making changes in the Save As dialog box, click the Save 
button or press Enter to have Excel 2010 save your work. When Excel saves 
your workbook file, the program saves all the information in every work-
sheet in your workbook (including the last position of the cell cursor) in the 
designated folder and drive.
 
You don’t have to fool with the Save As dialog box again unless you want to 
rename the workbook or save a copy of it in a different directory. If you want 
to do either of these things, you must click File➪Save As or press Alt+FA to 
choose the Save As command rather than click the Save button on the Quick 
Access toolbar or press Ctrl+S.
Figure 1-14 shows you the Save As dialog box as it appears in Excel 2010 
when running the program under Windows 7. Here, you can replace the tem-
porary filename (Book1, Book2, and so on) with a more descriptive name by 
clicking the File Name text box and typing in the new name (up to 255 char-
acters total including spaces).

The Save As 
dialog box

to select the

and folder 
for the new 
workbook 
file as well 
as add tags

To select a folder other than the default workbook folder in which to save 
the new workbook file, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the location of the folder in which you want to save the work-
book in the Navigation pane on the left.
 
 Click Recent Placed under Favorites if you’ve recently saved files in the 
folder. To save the file in a Library folder other than Document, click 
that folder. Click Computer to save the file in a folder on another local 
drive (or network drive that’s been mapped as a local drive). Click 
Network to save the file in a folder on a network drive.

Saving the Data
 
2. Double-click the folder in which you want to save the workbook file 
(or that contains the subfolder in which you want to save the file) in 
the main pane of the Save As dialog box.
 
 The Save As dialog box displays a list of all the workbook files currently 
saved in the selected folder and shows you the path to this folder in the 
text box at the top.
 
3. (Optional) If you want to create a new folder in which to save the 
workbook file, click the New Folder button on the toolbar and then 
replace the suggested New Folder name by typing the actual name of 
the folder and pressing Enter.
 
4. Click the Save button to save the file in the selected folder.
 
The Save As dialog box enables you to change the author or add tags to the 
new workbook file by clicking the Authors or Add a Tag link. You can then 
use any or all of these pieces of information you add to the file when later 
searching for the workbook. By default, the Save Thumbnail check box is 
selected enabling Excel to display a thumbnail preview of the workbook in 
the Preview pane of the Open dialog box (see Book II, Chapter 3 for details).
Saving workbooks in other commonly 
used file formats
When you click the Save As Type drop-down button in the Save As dialog 
box, Excel displays a long laundry list of file formats that you can choose 
from when saving the workbook file. You can use these file format options to 
instantly convert your worksheet data into another file format for use with 
applications other than Excel 2010.
 
Before saving a new workbook file in a non-Excel file format for use with 
another type of program (such as Web Page for the Internet, or PDF for the 
Adobe reader), be sure that you’ve first saved the spreadsheet data in a reg-
ular Excel Workbook file. That way, you continue to have ready access to the 
data in Excel 2010 for the purposes of further editing, printing, and so forth 
without having to convert the new file back into a native Excel Workbook file 
format.
The most commonly used file format options include the following:
 
✦ Excel Workbook: Saves the workbook in the default Excel 2010 .xlsx file 
format.
 
✦ Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook: Saves the workbook in the default 
.xlsx file format with all macros (see Chapter 12) it contains enabled.

Saving the Data
 
✦ Excel Binary Workbook: Saves the workbook in the binary file format 
optimized that enables faster loading of really large workbooks with 
tons of data.
 
✦ Excel 97-2003 Workbook: Saves the workbook in the .xls file format 
used by earlier versions of Excel 97 through Excel 2003 — note that an 
alert dialog box appears if Excel finds any features used in the workbook 
that aren’t supported in this file format.
 
✦ XML Data: Saves the workbook in an XML (Extensible Markup Language) 
format (using the .xml filename extension) often used to exchange lists 
of data over the Internet.
 
✦ Single File Web Page: Saves the workbook in an MIME HTML (Multipurpose 
Internet Mail Extension Hypertext Markup Language) with the .mhtm or 
.mhtml file extension. This special HTML format is used by some Web 
browsers (mainly Internet Explorer) to mimic the worksheets in the 
original workbook through the use of tabbed pages in the resulting Web 
page.
 
✦ Web Page: Saves the workbook in an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
used to render all the data on all worksheets in the workbook in a single 
continuous Web page with the .htm or .html filename extension.
 
✦ Excel Template: Saves the workbook in the .xltx file format as an Excel 
template file that you can use to generate new workbooks containing the 
same layout and content as the template.
 
✦ Excel Macro-Enabled Template: Saves the workbook in the .xltx 
template file format with all the macros (see Chapter 12) it contains 
enabled.
 
✦ PDF: Saves the workbook in an Adobe PDF (Portable Document File) 
format with the .pdf filename extension that can be opened with the free 
Adobe Reader program.
 
✦ XPS Document: Saves the workbook in an XPS (XML Paper Specification) 
file with the .xps filename extension used by many printers to render the 
data in a document, including Microsoft Office programs.
 
✦ OpenDocument Spreadsheet: Saves the workbook in ODF (OpenDocument 
Format) with an .ods filename extension that’s used by other Office 
suites of programs, particularly Sun Microsystems’ StarOffice suite.
 
Although less frequently needed, don’t forget that the Save As options 
include a number of text file conversions that you can use when your 
spreadsheet contains lists of data that you need to make available to pro-
grams that can deal with strings of text data. The major difference between 
the various text file formats is what character they use to separate the data 

122
Saving the Data
in each worksheet cell. So, the various Text (.txt) formats use tabs, the vari-
ous comma-separated value (or CSV, .csv) formats use commas, and the var-
ious text (.txt) formats use spaces.
Changing the default file location
Whenever you open the Save As dialog box to save a new workbook file, 
Excel 2010 automatically selects the folder listed in the Default File Location 
text box on the Save tab of the Excel Options dialog box (File➪Options➪Save 
or Alt+FIS).
When you first start using Excel, the default folder is either the My 
Documents (Windows XP), the Documents folder (Windows Vista), or 
Documents library (Windows 7) under your user name on your hard 
drive. So, for example, the directory path of the default folder where Excel 
2010 automatically saves new workbook files on my computer running 
Windows XP is
C:\Documents and Settings\Greg\My Documents
However, the directory path of the default folder where Excel 2010 automati-
cally saves new workbook files on my other computer running Windows 7 is
C:\Users\Greg\Documents
The very generic My Documents or Documents folder may not be the place 
on your hard drive where you want all the new workbooks you create auto-
matically saved. To change the default file location to another folder on your 
computer, follow these steps:
 
1. Click File➪Options➪Save or press Alt+FIS to open the Save tab of the 
Excel Options dialog box.
 
 The Default File Location text box displays the directory path to the cur-
rent default folder.
 
2. Click the Default File Location text box to select the current directory 
path.
 
 When you click the Default File Location text box, Excel selects the 
entire directory path so that if you begin typing, the characters you 
type replace the entire path. To edit part of the path (such as the My 
Documents or Documents folder name after your user name), click the 
mouse pointer at that place in the path to set the Insertion point.

3. Edit the existing path or replace it with the path to another existing 
folder in which you want all future workbooks to automatically be 
saved.
 
4. Click OK to close the Excel Options dialog box.
Saving a new workbook in the old file format
Excel 2010 automatically saves each new workbook file in a Microsoft ver-
sion of the XML-based file format (see the Appendix for details) which car-
ries the filename extension .xlsx. The problem with this XML file format is 
that it’s not one that versions of Excel prior to Excel 2007 can open. This 
means that if everybody who needs to work with the workbook you’ve just 
created hasn’t yet upgraded to Excel 2007 or 2010, you need to save the new 
workbook in the earlier file format used in versions 97 through 2003 with the 
old .xls filename extension.
To save a new workbook in the old binary Excel file format for back compat-
ibility, be sure to click the Save as Type drop-down button and then click 
Excel 97-2003 Workbook on the drop-down menu.
 
Excel automatically displays the Excel Compatibility Checker dialog box 
whenever you try to save a workbook file containing Excel 2010 features that 
aren’t supported in earlier versions of the program from Excel 97 through 
2003. This dialog box lists each incompatible feature in the workbook and 
gives you details on what will happen to the feature if you go ahead and 
save the workbook file in the older file format. To ignore these warnings and 
go ahead and save your workbook in the 97-2003 binary format, click the 
Continue button in the Excel Compatibility Checker dialog box.
 
If you still want to have access to all the features in the Excel 2010 workbook 
but you still need to create a backwardly compatible version of the work-
book file (even if it has less fidelity), first save the workbook in the XML file 
format with the .xlsx file extension. Then, save a copy in old 97-2003 binary 
file format with the .xls file extension by opening the Save As dialog box 
(File➪Save As or Alt+FA) and then selecting Excel 97-2003 on the Save as 
Type drop-down list before clicking the Save button.
 
Keep in mind that filename extensions such as .xlsx and .xls do not appear as 
part of the filename (even though they are appended) in the File Name text 
box in the Save As dialog box unless you’ve removed the check mark from 
the Hide Extensions for Known File Types check box found on the View tab 
of the Folder Options dialog box (Tools➪Options) in any Windows Explorer 
window (such as My Documents in Windows XP or Documents in Windows 7 
and Vista).

Document Recovery to the Rescue
Document Recovery to the Rescue
Excel 2010 offers a document recovery feature that can help you in the 
event of a computer crash because of a power failure or some sort of oper-
ating system freeze or shutdown. The AutoRecover feature saves your 
workbooks at regular intervals. In the event of a computer crash, Excel dis-
plays a Document Recovery Task pane the next time you start Excel after 
rebooting the computer.
 
When you first start using Excel 2010, the AutoRecover feature is set to 
automatically save changes to your workbook (provided that the file has 
already been saved) every ten minutes. You can shorten or lengthen this 
interval as you see fit. Click File➪Options➪Save or press Alt+FIS to open the 
Excel Options dialog box with the Save tab selected. Use the spinner but-
tons or enter a new automatic save interval into the text box marked Save 
AutoRecover Information Every 10 Minutes before clicking OK.
The Document Recovery Task pane shows the available versions of the 
workbook files that were open at the time of the computer crash. It identi-
fies the original version of the workbook file and when it was saved along 
with the recovered version of the file and when it was saved. To open the 
recovered version of a workbook (to see how much of the work it contains 
that was unsaved at the time of the crash), position the mouse pointer over 
the AutoRecover version. Then click its drop-down menu button and click 
Open on its pop-up menu. After you open the recovered version, you can (if 
you choose) then save its changes by clicking the Save button on the Quick 
Access toolbar or by clicking File➪Save.
You then have these choices:
 
✦ To save the recovered version of a workbook without bothering to first 
open it, place your mouse over the recovered version, click its drop-
down button, and choose the Save As option on the pop-up menu.
 
✦ To permanently abandon the recovered version (leaving you with only 
the data in the original version), click the Close button at the bottom of 
the Document Recovery Task pane. When you click the Close button, an 
alert dialog box appears, giving you the chance to retain the recovered 
versions of the file for later viewing.
 
✦ To retain the files for later viewing, select the Yes (I want to view these 
files later) radio button before clicking OK.
 
✦ To retain only the original versions of the files shown in the Task pane, 
select the No (remove these files. I have saved the files I need) radio 
button instead.

Document Recovery to the Rescue
 
The AutoRecover feature only works on Excel workbooks that have been 
saved at least one time (as explained in the earlier section “Saving the 
Data”). In other words, if you build a new workbook and don’t bother to save 
and rename it prior to experiencing a computer crash, the AutoRecover fea-
ture will not bring back any part of it. For this reason, it’s really important 
that you get into the habit of saving new workbooks with the Save button on 
the Quick Access toolbar very shortly after beginning to work on a work-
sheet. Or you can use the trusty keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S.

F
ormatting — the subject of this chapter — is the process by which you 
determine the final appearance of the worksheet and the data that it 
contains. Excel’s formatting features give you a great deal of control over 
the way the data appears in your worksheet.
For all types of cell entries, you can assign a new font, font size, font style 
(such as bold, italics, underlining, or strikethrough), or color. You can also 
change the alignment of entries in the cells in a variety of ways, including 
the horizontal alignment, the vertical alignment, or the orientation; you can 
also wrap text entries in the cell or center them across the selection. For 
numerical values, dates, and times, you can assign one of the many built-in 
number formats or apply a custom format that you design. For the cells that 
hold your entries, you can apply different kinds of borders, patterns, and 
colors. And to the worksheet grid itself, you can assign the most suitable 
column widths and row heights so that the data in the formatted worksheet 
are displayed at their best.
With the Table Styles and Cell Styles galleries and the command buttons in 
the Font, Alignment, and Number groups on the Home tab of the Ribbon, 
you’ll find formatting the spreadsheet to be really quick and easy. This is 
because Excel’s Live Preview feature enables you to see how a new font, 
font size, or table or cell style would look on your selected data before you 
actually apply it (saving you tons of time otherwise wasted applying format 
after format until you finally select the right one). And thanks to having but-
tons for all the most commonly used formatting commands right up front on 
the Home tab, you can now readily fine-tune the formatting of cell in a work-
sheet by making almost all needed changes right from the Ribbon.

Making Cell Selections
Making Cell Selections
Although you have to select the cells of the worksheet that you want to work 
with before you can accomplish many tasks used in building and editing a 
typical spreadsheet, perhaps no task requires cell selection like that of for-
matting. With the exception of the special Format as Table feature (which 
automatically selects the table to which its multiple formats are applied), 
selecting the cells whose appearance you want to enhance or modify is 
always your first step in their formatting.
In Excel, you can select a single cell, a block of cells (known as a cell range), 
or various discontinuous cell ranges (also known as a nonadjacent selection). 
Figure 2-1 shows a nonadjacent selection that consists of several different 
cell ranges (the smallest range is the single cell I9).
 
Note that a simple cell selection consisting of a single cell range is denoted 
in the worksheet both by highlighting the selected cells in a light blue 
color as well as by extending the border of the cell cursor so that it encom-
passes all the highlighted cells. In a nonadjacent cell selection, however, 
all selected cells are highlighted but only the active cell (the one whose 
address is displayed in the Name Box on the Formula bar) contains the cell 
cursor (whose borders are quite thin when compared to the regular cell 
cursor).
A range by any other name
Cell ranges are always noted in formulas by 
the first and last cell that you select, separated 
by a colon (:); therefore, if you select cell A1 
as the first cell and cell H10 as the last cell, 
and then use the range in a formula, the cell 
range appears as A1:H10. This same block of 
cells can just as well be noted as H10:A1 if you 
selected cell H10 before cell A1. Likewise, the 
same range can be equally noted as H1:A10 
or A10:H1, depending upon which corner cell 
you select first and which opposite corner you 
select last. Keep in mind that despite the vari-
ous range notations that you can use (A1:H10, 
H10:A1, H1:A10, and A10:H1), you are working 
with the same block of cells, the main differ-
ence being that each has a different active 
cell whose address appears in the Name box 
on the Formula bar (A1, H10, H1, and A10, 
respectively).

Selecting cells with the mouse
Excel offers several methods for selecting cells with the mouse. With each 
method, you start by selecting one of the cells that occupies the corner 
of the range that you want to select. The first corner cell that you click 
becomes the active cell (indicated by its cell reference in the Formula bar), 
and the cell range that you then select becomes anchored on this cell.
After you select the active cell in the range, drag the pointer to extend the 
selection until you have highlighted all the cells that you want to include. 
Here are some tips:
 
✦ To extend a range in a block that spans several columns, drag left or 
right from the active cell.
 
✦ To extend a range in a block that spans several rows, drag up or down 
from the active cell.
 
✦ To extend a range in a block that spans several columns and rows, 
drag diagonally from the active cell in the most logical directions (up 
and to the right, down and to the right, up and to the left, or down and 
to the left).

130
Making Cell Selections
If you ever extend the range too far in one direction, you can always reduce 
it by dragging in the other direction. If you’ve already released the mouse 
button and you find that the range is incorrect, click the active cell again 
(clicking any cell in the worksheet deselects a selected range and activates 
the cell that you click). Then select the range of cells again.
 
You can always tell which cell is the active cell forming the anchor point of 
a cell range because it is the only cell within the range that you’ve selected 
that isn’t highlighted and is the only cell reference listed in the Name box on 
the Formula bar. As you extend the range by dragging the thick white-cross 
mouse pointer, Excel indicates the current size of the range in columns and 
rows in the Name box (as in 5R x 2C when you’ve highlighted a range of 
five rows long and two columns wide). However, as soon as you release the 
mouse button, Excel replaces this row and column notation with the address 
of the active cell.
You can also use the following shortcuts when selecting cells with the 
mouse:
 
✦ To select a single-cell range, click the thick white-cross mouse pointer 
somewhere inside the cell.
 
✦ To select all cells in an entire column, position the mouse pointer on the 
column letter in the column header and then click the mouse button. To 
select several adjacent columns, drag through their column letters in 
the column header.
 
✦ To select all cells in an entire row, position the mouse pointer on the 
row number in the row header and then click the mouse button. To 
select several adjacent rows, drag through the row numbers in the row 
header.
 
✦ To select all the cells in the worksheet, click the box in the upper-left of 
the worksheet at the intersection of row and column headers with the 
triangle in the lower-right corner that makes it look like the corner of a 
dog-eared or folded down book page. (You can also do this from the key-
board by pressing Ctrl+A.)
 
✦ To select a cell range composed of partial columns and rows without 
dragging, click the cell where you want to anchor the range, hold down 
the Shift key, and then click the last cell in the range and release the 
Shift key (Excel selects all the cells in between the first and the last cell 
that you click). If the range that you want to mark is a block that spans 
several columns and rows, the last cell is the one diagonally opposite 
the active cell. When using this Shift+click technique to mark a range 
that extends beyond the screen, use the scroll bars to display the last 
cell in the range (just make sure that you don’t release the Shift key until 
after you’ve clicked this last cell).

131
Making Cell Selections
 
✦ To select a nonadjacent selection comprised of several discontinuous 
cell ranges, drag through the first cell range, and then hold down the 
Ctrl key as you drag through the other ranges. After you have marked 
all the cell ranges to be included in the nonadjacent selection, you can 
release the Ctrl key.
Selecting cells with the keyboard
Excel also makes it easy for you to select cell ranges with the keyboard by 
using a technique known as extending a selection. To use this technique, you 
move the cell cursor to the active cell of the range; then press F8 to turn on 
Extend Selection mode (indicated by Extend Selection on the Status bar) and 
use the direction keys to move the pointer to the last cell in the range. Excel 
selects all the cells that the cell cursor moves through until you turn off 
Extend Selection mode (by pressing F8 again).
You can use the mouse as well as the keyboard to extend a selection when 
Excel is in Extend Selection mode. All you do is click the active cell, press F8, 
and then click the last cell to mark the range.
You can also select a cell range with the keyboard without turning on Extend 
Selection mode. Here, you use a variation of the Shift+click method by 
moving the cell cursor to the active cell in the range, holding down the Shift 
key, and then using the direction keys to extend the range. After you’ve high-
lighted all the cells that you want to include, release the Shift key.
To mark a nonadjacent selection of cells with the keyboard, you need to com-
bine the use of Extend Selection mode with that of Add to Selection mode. To 
turn on Add to Selection mode (indicated by Add to Selection on the Status 
bar), you press Shift+F8. To mark a nonadjacent selection by using Extend 
Selection and Add to Selection modes, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cell cursor to the first cell of the first range you want to select.
 
2. Press F8 to turn on Extend Selection mode.
 
3. Use the arrow keys to extend the cell range until you’ve highlighted 
all its cells.
 
4. Press Shift+F8 to turn off Extend Selection mode and turn on Add to 
Selection mode instead.
 
5. Move the cell cursor to the first cell of the next cell range you want to 
add to the selection.
 
6. Press F8 to turn off Add to Selection mode and turn Extend Selection 
mode back on.
 
7. Use the arrow keys to extend the range until all cells are highlighted.

8. Repeat Steps 4 through 7 until you’ve selected all the ranges that you 
want included in the nonadjacent selection.
 
9. Press F8 to turn off Extend Selection mode.
You AutoSelect that range!
Excel’s AutoSelect feature provides a particularly efficient way to select all 
or part of the cells in a large table of data. AutoSelect automatically extends 
a selection in a single direction from the active cell to the first nonblank cell 
that Excel encounters in that direction.
You can use the AutoSelect feature with the mouse or keyboard. The gen-
eral steps for using AutoSelect to select a table of data with the mouse are 
as follows:
 
1. Click the first cell to which you want to anchor the range that you are 
about to select.
 
 In a typical data table, this cell may be the blank cell at the intersection 
of the row of column headings and the column of row headings.
 
2. Position the mouse pointer on the edge of the cell in the direction you 
want to extend the range.
 
 To extend the range up to the first blank cell to the right, position the 
pointer on the right edge of the cell. To extend the range left to the first 
blank cell, position the pointer on the left edge of the cell. To extend the 
range down to the first blank cell, position the pointer on the bottom 
edge of the cell. And to extend the range up to the first blank cell, posi-
tion the pointer on the top edge of the cell.
 
3. When the pointer changes shape from a cross to an arrowhead, hold 
down the Shift key and then double-click the mouse.
 
 As soon as you double-click the mouse, Excel extends the selection to 
the first occupied cell that is adjacent to a blank cell in the direction of 
the edge that you double-clicked.
To get an idea of how AutoSelect works, consider how you use it to select 
all the data in the table (cell range A3:J8) shown in Figures 2-2 and 2-3. With 
the cell cursor in cell A3 at the intersection of the row with the Date column 
headings and the column with the Part row headings, you can use the 
AutoSelect feature to select all the cells in the table in two operations:
 
✦ In the first operation, hold down the Shift key and then double-click the 
bottom edge of cell A3 to highlight the cells down to A8, selecting the 
range A3:A8 (see Figure 2-2).
 
✦ In the second operation, hold down the Shift key and then double-click 
the right edge of cell range A3:A8 to extend the selection to the last 
column in the table (selecting the entire table with the cell range A3:J8, 
as shown in Figure 2-3).

Making Cell Selections
If you select the cells in the first row of the table (range A3:J3) in the first 
operation, you can then extend this range down the remaining rows of the 
table by double-clicking the bottom edge of one of the selected cells (it 
doesn’t matter which one).
To use the AutoSelect feature with the keyboard, press the End key and one 
of the four arrow keys as you hold down the Shift key. When you hold down 
Shift and press End and an arrow key, Excel extends the selection in the 
direction of the arrow key to the first cell containing a value that is bordered 
by a blank cell.
In terms of selecting the table of data shown in Figures 2-2 and 2-3, this 
means that you would have to complete four separate operations to select 
all of its cells:
 
1. With A3 as the active cell, hold down Shift and press End+↓ to select 
the range A3:A8.
 
 Excel stops at A8 because this is the last occupied cell in that column. At 
this point, the cell range A3:A8 is selected.
 
2. Hold down Shift and then press End+→.
 
 Excel extends the range all the way to column J (because the cells in 
column J contain entries bordered by blank cells). Now all the cells in 
the table (the cell range A3:J8) are selected.
Selecting cells with Go To
Although you usually use the Go To feature to move the cell cursor to a new 
cell in the worksheet, you can also use this feature to select a range of cells. 
When you click the Go To option on the Find & Select button’s drop-down 
menu on the Home tab of the Ribbon (or press Ctrl+G or F5), Excel displays 
a Go To dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 2-4. To move the cell 
cursor to a particular cell, enter the cell address in the Reference text box 
and click OK. (Excel automatically lists the addresses of the last four cells or 
cell ranges that you specified in the Go To list box.)
Instead of just moving to a new section of the worksheet with the Go To fea-
ture, you can select a range of cells by taking these steps:
 
1. Select the first cell of the range.
 
 This becomes the active cell to which the cell range is anchored.
 
2. On the Ribbon, click the Find & Select command button in the Editing 
group on the Home tab and then click Go To on its drop-down menu 
bar or press Ctrl+G or F5.

 The Go To dialog box opens.
 
3. Type the cell address of the last cell in the range in the Reference 
text box.
 
 If this address is already listed in the Go To list box, you can enter this 
address in the text box by clicking it in the list box.
 
4. Hold down the Shift key as you click OK or press Enter to close the Go 
To dialog box.
 
 By holding down Shift as you click OK or press Enter, you select the 
range between the active cell and the cell whose address you specified 
in the Reference text box.
 
Instead of selecting the anchor cell and then specifying the last cell of a 
range in the Reference text box of the Go To dialog box, you can also select a 
range simply by typing in the address of the cell range in the Reference text 
box. Remember that when you type a range address, you enter the cell ref-
erence of the first (active) cell and the last cell in the range separated by a 
colon. For example, to select the cell range that extends from cell B2 to G10 
in the worksheet, you would type the range address B2:G10 in the Reference 
text box before clicking OK or pressing Enter.
Name that range!
One of the easiest ways to select a range of data is to assign a name to it and 
then choose that name on the pop-up menu attached to the Name box on 
the Formula bar or in the Go To list box in the Go To dialog box. Of course, 
you reserve this technique for cell ranges that you work with on a somewhat 
regular basis; for example, ranges with data that you print regularly, consult 
often, or have to refer to in formula calculations. It’s probably not worth 
your while to name a range of data that doesn’t carry any special importance 
in the spreadsheet.
To name a cell range, follow three simple steps:
 
1. Select all the cells in the range that you intend to name.
 
 You can use any of the cell selection techniques that you prefer. When 
selecting the cells for the named range, be sure to include all the cells 
that you want selected each time you select its range name.

136
Adjusting Columns and Rows
 
2. Click the Name box on the Formula bar.
 
 Excel automatically highlights the address of the active cell in the 
selected range.
 
3. Type the range name in the Name box and then press Enter.
 
 As soon as you start typing, Excel replaces the address of the active 
cell with the range name that you’re assigning. As soon as you press the 
Enter key, the name appears in the Name box instead of the cell address 
of the active cell in the range.
When naming a cell range, however, you must observe the following naming 
conventions:
 
✦ Begin the range name with a letter of the alphabet rather than a number 
or punctuation mark.
 
✦ Don’t use spaces in the range name; instead, use an underscore between 
words in a range name (as in Qtr_1).
 
✦ Make sure that the range name doesn’t duplicate any cell reference in 
the worksheet by using either the standard A1 or R1C1 notation system.
 
✦ Make sure that the range name is unique in the worksheet.
After you’ve assigned a name to a cell range, you can select all its cells 
simply by clicking the name on the pop-up menu attached to the Name 
box on the Formula bar. The beauty of this method is that you can use it 
from anywhere in the same sheet or a different worksheet in the workbook 
because as soon as you click its name on the Name box pop-up menu, Excel 
takes you directly to the range, while at the same time automatically select-
ing all its cells.
 
Range names are also very useful when building formulas in your spread-
sheet. For more on creating and using range names, see Book III, Chapter 1.
Adjusting Columns and Rows
Along with knowing how to select cells for formatting, you really also have to 
know how to adjust the width of your columns and the heights of your rows. 
Why? Because often in the course of assigning different formatting to certain 
cell ranges (such as new font and font size in boldface type), you may find 
that data entries that previously fit within the original widths of their column 
no longer do and that the rows that they occupy seem to have changed 
height all on their own.
In a blank worksheet, all the columns and rows are the same standard width 
and height. All columns start out 8.43 characters wide (or 64 pixels) and all 
rows start out 15 points high (or 20 pixels). As you build your spreadsheet, 

Book II
Chapter 2
Formatting 
Worksheets
137
Adjusting Columns and Rows
you end up with all sorts of data entries that can’t fit within these default set-
tings. This is especially true as you start adding formatting to their cells to 
enhance and clarify their contents.
Most of the time, you don’t need to be concerned with the heights of the 
rows in your worksheet because Excel automatically adjusts them up or 
down to accommodate the largest font size used in a cell in the row and 
the number of text lines (in some cells, you may wrap their text on several 
lines). Instead, you’ll spend a lot more time adjusting the column widths to 
suit the entries for the formatting that you assign to them.
 
Remember what happens when you put a text entry in a cell whose current 
width isn’t long enough to accommodate all its characters. If the cells in 
columns to the right are empty, Excel lets the display of the extra characters 
spill over into the empty cells. If these cells are already occupied, however, 
Excel cuts off the display of the extra characters until you widen the column 
sufficiently. Likewise, remember that if you add formatting to a number so 
that its value and formatting can’t both be displayed in the cell, those nasty 
overflow indicators appear in the cell as a string of pound signs (#####) 
until you widen the column adequately.
You AutoFit the column to its contents
The easiest way to adjust the width of a column to suit its longest entry is 
to use the AutoFit feature. AutoFit determines the best fit for the column or 
columns selected at that time, given their longest entries.
 
✦ To use AutoFit on a single column: Position the mouse pointer on the 
right edge of that column in the column header and then, when the 
pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, double-click the mouse.
 
✦ To use AutoFit on multiple columns at one time: Select the columns 
by dragging through them in the column header or by Ctrl+clicking 
the column letters, and then double-click the right edge of one of the 
selected columns when the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow.
These AutoFit techniques work well for adjusting all columns except for 
those that contain really long headings (such as the spreadsheet title that 
often spills over several blank columns in row 1), in which case, AutoFit 
makes the columns far too wide for the bulk of the cell entries.
For those situations, use the AutoFit Selection command, which adjusts the 
column width to suit only the entries in the cells of the column that you have 
selected. This way, you can select all the cells except for any really long 
ones in the column that purposely spill over to empty cells on the right, and 
then have Excel adjust the width to suit. After you’ve selected the cells in 
the column that you want the new width to fit, click the Format button in the 
Cells group on the Home tab and then click AutoFit Selection on the drop-
down menu.

138
Adjusting Columns and Rows
Adjusting columns the old fashioned way
AutoFit is nothing if not quick and easy. If you need more precision in adjust-
ing your column widths, you have to do this manually either by dragging 
its border with the mouse or by entering new values in the Column Width 
dialog box.
 
✦ To manually adjust a column width with the mouse: Drag the right 
edge of that column onto the Column header to the left (to narrow) or 
to the right (to widen) as required. As you drag the column border, a 
ScreenTip appears above the mouse pointer indicating the current width 
in both characters and pixels. When you have the column adjusted to 
the desired width, release the mouse button to set it.
 
✦ To adjust a column width in the Column Width dialog box: Position 
the cell cursor in any one of the cells in the column that you want to 
adjust, click the Format button in the Cells group on the Home tab of the 
Ribbon and then click Column Width on the drop-down list to open the 
Column Width dialog box, shown in Figure 2-5. Here, you enter the new 
width (in the number of characters between 0 and 255) in the Column 
Width text box before clicking OK.
 
You can apply a new column width that you set in the Column Width dialog 
box to more than a single column by selecting the columns (either by drag-
ging through their letters on the Column header or holding down Ctrl as you 
click them) before you open the Column Width dialog box.
 
Figure 2-5: 
Adjusting 
the column 
width with 
the Column 
Width 
dialog box.
 
Setting a new standard width
You can use the Default Standard Width command to set all the columns in 
a worksheet to a new uniform width (other than the default 8.43 characters). 
To do so, simply click the Format button in the Cells group on the Home tab 
of the Ribbon and then click Default Width on the drop-down menu. Doing 
this opens the Standard Width dialog box where you can replace the default 
8.43 in the Standard Column Width text box with your new width (in charac-
ters), and then click OK or press Enter.

Book II
Chapter 2
Formatting 
Worksheets
139
Adjusting Columns and Rows
 
Note that when you set a new standard width for the columns of your work-
sheet, this new width doesn’t affect any columns whose width you’ve previ-
ously adjusted either with AutoFit or in the Column Width dialog box.
Hiding out a column or two
You can use the Hide command to temporarily remove columns of data from 
the worksheet display. When you hide a column, you’re essentially setting 
the column width to 0 (and thus, making it so narrow that for all intents and 
purposes, the sucker’s gone). Hiding columns enables you to remove the 
display of sensitive or supporting data that needs to be in the spreadsheet 
but may not be appropriate in printouts that you distribute (keeping in mind 
that only columns and rows that are displayed in the worksheet get printed).
To hide a column, put the cell cursor in a cell in that column, click the 
Format button in the Cells group on the Home tab, and then click Hide & 
Unhide on the drop-down menu and Hide Columns on the continuation menu 
(or you can just press Alt+HOUC).
To hide more than one column at a time, select the columns either by drag-
ging through their letters on the Column header or by holding down Ctrl as 
you click them before you choose this command sequence.
Excel lets you know that certain columns are missing from the worksheet 
by removing their column letters from the Column header so that if, for 
example, you hide columns D and E in the worksheet, column C is followed 
by column F on the Column header.
To restore hidden columns to view, select the visible columns on either side 
of the hidden one(s) — indicated by the missing letter(s) on the column 
headings — and then click the Format button in the Cells group on the Home 
tab. Then click Hide & Unhide on the drop-down menu and Unhide Columns 
on the continuation menu (or you can just press Alt+HOUL).
Because Excel also automatically selects all the redisplayed columns, you 
need to deselect the selected columns before you select any more format-
ting or editing commands that will affect all their cells. You can do this by 
clicking a single cell anywhere in the worksheet or by dragging through a 
particular cell range that you want to work with.
 
Keep in mind that when you hide a column, the data in the cells in all its 
rows (1 through 1,048,576) are hidden (not just the ones you can see on 
your computer screen). This means that if you have some data in rows of 
a column that need printing and some in other rows of that same column 
that need concealing, you can’t use the Hide command to remove their dis-
play until you’ve moved the cells with the data to be printed into a different 
column (see Book II, Chapter 5 for details).

140
Adjusting Columns and Rows
Rambling rows
The controls for adjusting the height of the rows in your worksheet paral-
lel those that you use to adjust its columns. The big difference is that Excel 
always applies AutoFit to the height of each row so that even though you 
find an AutoFit Row Height menu item under Cell size on the Format button’s 
drop-down menu, you won’t find much use for it (personally, I’ve never had 
any reason to use it).
Instead, you’ll probably end up manually adjusting the heights of rows with 
the mouse or by entering new height values in the Row Height dialog box 
(opened by clicking Row Height on the Format button’s drop-down menu 
on the Home tab) and occasionally hiding rows with sensitive or potentially 
confusing data. Follow these instructions for each type of action:
 
✦ To adjust the height of a row with the mouse: Position the mouse 
pointer on the lower edge of the row’s border in the Row header and 
then drag up or down when the mouse pointer changes to a double-
headed, vertical arrow. As you drag, a ScreenTip appears to the side of 
the pointer, keeping you informed of the height in characters and also 
pixels (remember that 15 points or 20 pixels is the default height of all 
rows in a new worksheet).
 
✦ To change the height of a row in the Row Height dialog box: Click Row 
Height on the Format button’s drop-down menu in the Cells group of the 
Ribbon’s Home tab and then enter the value for the new row height in 
the Row Height text box before you click OK or press Enter.
 
✦ To hide a row: Position the cell cursor in any one of the cells in that row 
and then click the Format button in the Cells group on the Home tab 
before you click Hide & Unhide on the drop-down menu and Hide Rows 
on the continuation menu (or press Alt+HOUR). To then restore the 
rows that you currently have hidden in the worksheet, click the Format 
button and then click Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Rows on the drop-down 
and continuation menus (or just press Alt+HOUO) instead.
 
As with adjusting columns, you can change the height of more than one row 
and hide multiple rows at the same time by selecting the rows before you 
drag one of their lower borders, open the Row Height dialog box, or click 
Format➪Hide & Unhide➪Hide Rows on the Home tab, or press Alt+HOUR.
Formatting Ranges as Tables with Table Styles
Excel 2010’s Format as Table feature enables you to both define an entire 
range of data as a table and format all its data all in one operation. After 
you define a cell range as a table, you can completely modify its formatting 
simply by clicking a new style thumbnail in the Table Styles gallery. Excel 
also automatically extends this table definition — and consequently its table

Formatting Ranges as Tables with Table Styles
formatting — to all the new rows you insert within the table and add at the 
bottom as well as any new columns you insert within the table or add to 
either the table’s left or right end.
The Format as Table feature is so automatic that to use it, you only need to 
position the cell cursor somewhere within the table of data prior to clicking 
the Format as Table command button on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Clicking 
the Format as Table command button opens its rather extensive Table Styles 
gallery with the formatting thumbnails divided into three sections — Light, 
Medium, and Dark — each of which describes the intensity of the colors 
used by its various formats.
As soon as you click one of the table formatting thumbnails in this Table 
Styles gallery, Excel makes its best guess as to the cell range of the data 
table to apply it to (indicated by the marquee around its perimeter), and the 
Format As Table dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 2-6 appears.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Indicating 
the range 
of the

This dialog box contains a Where Is the Data for Your Table? text box that 
shows the address of the cell range currently selected by the marquee and a 
My Table Has Headers check box (selected by default).
If Excel does not correctly guess the range of the data table you want to 
format, drag through the cell range to adjust the marquee and the range 
address in the Where Is the Data for Your Table? text box. If your data table 
doesn’t use column headers, click the My Table Has Headers check box to 
deselect it before you click the OK button — Excel will then add its own 
column headings (Column1, Column2, Column3, and so forth) as the top row 
of the new table.

142
Formatting Ranges as Tables with Table Styles
 
Keep in mind that the table formats in the Table Styles gallery are not avail-
able if you select multiple nonadjacent cells before you click the Format as 
Table command button on the Home tab. You can only convert one range of 
cell data into a table at a time.
After you click the OK button in the Format As Table dialog box, Excel 
applies the format of the thumbnail you clicked in the gallery to the data 
table, and the command buttons on the Design tab of the Table Tools con-
textual tab appear on the Ribbon.
Figure 2-7 shows the Design tab and its command buttons after defining the 
cell range A3:J8 (with the scheduled production of various parts for 2010 as 
a table) by applying Table Style Light 1 to this cell range.
 
Figure 2-7: 
After you 
select an 
initial table 
format, 
the Design 
tab under 
Table Tools 
appears.
 
 
As you can see in Figure 2-7, when Excel defines a range as a table, it auto-
matically adds AutoFilter drop-down buttons to each of the column head-
ings. To hide these AutoFilter buttons, click the Filter button on the Data tab 
or press Alt+AT (you can always redisplay them by clicking the Filter button 
on the Data tab or by pressing Alt+AT a second time).
The Design contextual tab enables you to use the Live Preview feature to see 
how your table data would appear in other table styles. Simply position the 
mouse pointer over any of the format thumbnails in the Table Style group to

see the data in your table appear in that table format. Click the More button 
(the one with the horizontal bar above the downward pointing triangle) to 
redisplay the Table gallery and then mouse over the thumbnails in the Light, 
Medium, and Dark sections to have Live Preview apply them to the table.
 
Click the button with the triangle pointing downward to scroll up new rows 
of table formats in the Table Styles group and the button with the triangle 
pointing upward to scroll down rows without opening the Table gallery and 
possibly obscuring the actual data table in the Worksheet area.
In addition to enabling you to select a new format from the Table gallery in 
the Table Styles group, the Design tab contains a Table Style Options group 
you can use to further customize the look of the selected format. The Table 
Style Options group contains the following check boxes:
 
✦ Header Row: Add Filter buttons to each of the column headings in the 
first row of the table.
 
✦ Total Row: Add a Total row to the bottom of the table that displays the 
sum of the last column of the table (assuming that it contains values). 
To apply another Statistical function to the values in a particular 
column, click the cell in that column’s Total row to display a drop-down 
list button, and then the function to use the drop-down menu of func-
tions, Average, Count, Count Numbers, Max, Min, Sum, StdDev (Standard 
Deviation), or Var (Variation), that appears when you click its drop-
down button.
 
✦ Banded Rows: Apply shading to every other row in the table.
 
✦ First Column: Display the row headings in the first row of the table in 
bold.
 
✦ Last Column: Display the row headings in the last row of the table in 
bold.
 
✦ Banded Columns: Apply shading to every other column in the table.
 
Keep in mind that whenever you assign a format in the Table Styles gallery 
to one of the data tables in your workbook, Excel automatically assigns that 
table a generic range name (Table1, Table2, and so on). You can use the 
Table Name text box in the Properties group on the Design tab to rename 
the data table by giving it a more descriptive range name. 
 
When you finish selecting and/or customizing the formatting of your data 
table, click a cell outside of the table to remove the Design contextual tab 
from the Ribbon. If you later decide that you want to further experiment with 
the table’s formatting, click any of the table’s cells to redisplay the Design 
contextual tab at the end of the Ribbon.

Formatting Cells from the Home Tab
Formatting Cells from the Home Tab
Some spreadsheet tables require a lighter touch than the Format as Table 
command button offers. For example, you may have a data table where the 
only emphasis you want to add is to make the column headings bold at the 
top of the table and to underline the row of totals at the bottom (done by 
drawing a borderline along the bottom of the cells).
The formatting buttons that appear in the Font, Alignment, and Number 
groups on the Home tab enable you to accomplish just this kind of targeted 
cell formatting. Figure 2-8 identifies all the buttons in the Font group of the 
Home tab. Figure 2-9 identifies all the buttons in the Alignment group of 
the Home tab. And Figure 2-10 identifies all the buttons in Number group 
of the Home tab. See Table 2-1 for a complete rundown on the use of each 
of these formatting buttons.

nicknamed the mini-bar, which makes me thirsty just thinking about it!

Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
To display the mini-bar, select the cells that need formatting and then right-
click somewhere in the cell selection. The mini-bar then appears immedi-
ately below or above the cell selection’s shortcut menu (see Figure 2-11).
The mini-bar contains most of the buttons from the Font group of the 
Home tab (with the exception of the Underline button). It also contains the 
Center & Merge and Center buttons from the Alignment group (see “Altering 
the alignment” later in this chapter) and the Accounting Number Format, 
Percent Style, Comma Style, Increase Decimal, and Decrease Decimal but-
tons from the Number group. Simply click these buttons to apply their for-
matting to the current cell selection.
In addition, the mini-bar contains the Format Painter button from the 
Clipboard group of the Home tab, which you can use to copy the formatting 
in the active cell to a cell selection you make (see “Hiring Out the Format 
Painter” later in this chapter for details).

Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
Although the command buttons in the Font, Alignment, and Number groups 
on the Home tab give you immediate access to the most commonly used 
formatting commands, they do not represent all of Excel’s formatting com-
mands by any stretch of the imagination.
To have access to all the formatting commands, you need to open the 
Format Cells dialog box either by clicking the Dialog Box Launcher in the 
Number group on the Ribbon’s Home tab, clicking the More Number Formats 
option at the bottom of the Number Format button’s drop-down menu in the 
same Number group, or by simply pressing Ctrl+1.

The Format Cells dialog box contains six tabs: Number, Alignment, Font, 
Border, Fill, and Protection. (In this chapter, I show you how to use them all 
except the Protection tab; for information on that tab, see Book IV, Chapter 1.)
 
The keystroke shortcut that opens the Format Cells dialog box — Ctrl+1 — is 
one worth knowing. Just keep in mind that the keyboard shortcut is pressing 
the Ctrl key plus the number 1 key, and not the function key F1.
Assigning number formats
When you enter numbers in a cell or a formula that returns a number, Excel 
automatically applies the General number format to your entry. The General 
format displays numeric entries more or less as you enter them. However, 
the General format does make the following changes to your numeric 
entries:
 
✦ Drops any trailing zeros from decimal fractions so that 4.5 appears 
when you enter 4.500 in a cell.
 
✦ Drops any leading zeros in whole numbers so that 4567 appears when 
you enter 04567 in a cell.
 
✦ Inserts a zero before the decimal point in any decimal fraction without a 
whole number so that 0.123 appears when you enter .123 in a cell.
 
✦ Truncates decimal places in a number to display the whole numbers in 
a cell when the number contains too many digits to be displayed in the 
current column width. It also converts the number to scientific notation 
when the column width is too narrow to display all integers in the whole 
number.
Remember that you can always override the General number format when you 
enter a number by entering the characters used in recognized number for-
mats. For example, to enter the value 2500 and assign it the Currency number 
format that displays two decimal places, you enter $2,500.00 in the cell.
Note that although you can override the General number format and assign 
one of the others to any numeric value that you enter into a cell, you can’t 
do this when you enter a formula into a cell. To apply another format to a 
calculated result, select its cell and then assign the Currency number format 
that displays two decimal places by clicking Accounting Number Format in 
the Number group on the Ribbon’s Home tab or by selecting Currency or 
Accounting on the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1).
Using one of the predefined number formats
Any time you apply a number format to a cell selection (even if you do so 
with a command button in the Number group on the Ribbon’s Home tab 
instead of selecting the format from the Number tab of the Format Cells 
dialog box), you’re telling Excel to apply a particular group of format codes 
to those cells.

152
Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
Figure 2-12 shows the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box as it 
appears when you first open the dialog box. As you can see in this figure, 
when the Number tab is initially selected, the General category of number 
formats is highlighted in the Category list box with the words “General 
format cells have no specific number format” showing in the area to the 
right. Directly above this cryptic message (which is Excel-speak for “We 
don’t care what you’ve put in your cell; we’re not changing it!”) is the Sample 
area. This area shows how the number in the active cell appears in whatever 
format you choose (this is blank if the active cell is blank or if it contains 
text instead of a number).

When you click the Number, Currency, Accounting, or Percentage category 
in the Category list box, more options appear in the area just to the right 
of the Category list box in the form of different check boxes, list boxes, 
and spinner buttons. (Figure 2-13 shows the Format Cells dialog box when 
Currency is selected in the Category list box.) These options determine how 
you want items such as decimal places, dollar signs, comma separators, and 
negative numbers to be used in the format category that you’ve chosen.
When you choose the Date, Time, Fraction, Special, or Custom category, a 
large Type list box appears that contains handfuls of predefined category 
types, which you can apply to your value to change its appearance. Just like 
when you’re selecting different formatting categories, the Sample area of the 
Format Cells dialog box shows you how the various category types will affect 
your selection.

I should note here that Excel always tries to choose an appropriate format 
category in the Category list box based on the way you entered your value in 
the selected cell. If you enter 3:00 in a cell and then open the Number tab of 
the Format Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1), Excel highlights the h:mm time format 
in the Custom category in the Type list box.
Deciphering the Custom number formats
You probably noticed while clicking around the Category list box that, for 
the most part, the different categories and their types are pretty easy — if 
not a breeze — to comprehend. For most people, that self-assured feeling 
goes right out the window as soon as they click the Custom category and get 
a load of its accompanying Type list box, shown in Figure 2-14. It starts off 
with the nice word General, then 0, then 0.00, and after that, all hell breaks 
loose! Codes with 0s and #s (and other junk) start to appear, and it only goes 
downhill from there.
What you see is not always what you get
The number format that you assign to cells 
with numeric entries in the worksheet affects 
only the way they are displayed in their cells, 
and not their underlying values. For example, 
if a formula returns the value 3.456789 in a cell 
and you apply a number format that displays 
only two decimal places, Excel will display the 
value 3.46 in the cell. If you then refer to the 
cell in a formula that multiplies its value by 2, 
Excel returns the result 6.913578 instead of the 
result 6.92, which would be the result if Excel 
was actually multiplying 3.46 by 2. If you want 
to modify the underlying value in a cell, you use 
the ROUND function (see Book III, Chapter 5 for 
details).

154
Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
As you move down the list, the longer codes are divided into sections sepa-
rated by semicolons and enclosed within square brackets. Although at first 
glance these codes appear as gibberish, you’ll actually find that they’re quite 
understandable (well, would you believe useful, then?).
And these codes can be useful, especially after you understand them. You 
can use them to create number formats of your own design. The basic keys 
to understanding number format codes are as follows:
 
Figure 2-14: 
Creating 
your own 
number 
format using 
the Custom 
category 
in the 
Format Cells 
dialog box.
 
 
✦ Excel number formats use a combination of 0, ?, and # symbols with 
such punctuation as dollar signs, percent signs, and commas to stand 
for the formatted digits in the numbers that you format.
 
✦ The 0 is used to indicate how many decimal places (if any) are allowed 
in the format. The format code 0.00 indicates that two decimal places 
are used in the number. The format code 0 alone indicates that no 
decimal places appear (the display of all values is rounded up to whole 
numbers).
 
✦ The ? is used like the 0, except that it inserts spaces at the end as 
needed to make sure that values line up on the decimal point. For exam-
ple, by entering the number format 0.??, such values as 10.5 and 24.71 
line up with each other in their cells because Excel adds an extra space 
after the 5 to push it over to the left so that it’s in line with the 7 of 71. 
If you used the number format 0.00 instead, these two values would not 
line up on the decimal point when they are right-aligned in their cells.
 
✦ The # symbol is used with a comma to indicate that you want thou-
sands, hundred thousands, millions, zillions, and so on in your numbers, 
with each group of three digits to be separated with a comma.
 
✦ The $ (dollar sign) symbol is added to the beginning of a number format 
if you want dollar signs to appear at the beginning of every formatted 
number.

Chapter 2

✦ The % (percent sign) symbol is added to the end of the number format if 
you want Excel to actually transform the value into a percentage (multiply-
ing it by 100 and adding a percent sign).
Number formats can specify one format for positive values, another for nega-
tive values, a third for zero values, and even a fourth format for text in the 
cells. In such complex formats, the format codes for positive values come first, 
followed by the codes for negative values, and a semicolon separates each 
group of codes. Any format codes for how to handle zeros and text in a cell 
come third and fourth, respectively, in the number format, again separated 
by semicolons. If the number format doesn’t specify special formatting for 
negative or zero values, these values are automatically formatted like positive 
values. If the number format doesn’t specify what to do with text, text is for-
matted according to Excel’s default values. For example, look at the following 
number format:
#,##0_);(#,##0)
This particular number format specifies how to format positive values (the 
codes in front of the semicolon) and negative values (the codes after the semi-
colon). Because no further groups of codes exist, zeros are formatted like posi-
tive values, and no special formatting is applied to text.
If a number format puts negative values inside parentheses, the positive 
number format portion often pads the positive values with a space that is the 
same width as a right parenthesis. To indicate this, you add an underscore (by 
pressing Shift and the hyphen key) followed immediately by a closed paren-
thesis symbol. By padding positive numbers with a space equivalent to a right 
parenthesis, you ensure that digits of both positive and negative values line up 
in a column of cells.
You can assign different colors to a number format. For example, you can 
create a format that displays the values in green (the color of money!) by 
adding the code [GREEN] at the beginning of the format. A more common use 
of color is to display just the negative numbers in red (ergo the saying “in the 
red”) by inserting the code [RED] right after the semicolon separating the 
format for positive numbers from the one for negative numbers. Color codes 
include [BLACK], [BLUE], [CYAN], [GREEN], [MAGENTA], [RED], [WHITE], and 
[YELLOW].
Date number formats use a series of abbreviations for month, day, and year 
that are separated by characters, such as a dash (—) or a slash (/). The code 
m inserts the month as a number; mmm inserts the month as a three-letter 
abbreviation, such as Apr or Oct; and mmmm spells out the entire month, such 
as April or October. The code d inserts the date as a number; dd inserts the 
date as a number with a leading zero, such as 04 or 07; ddd inserts the date as a 
three-letter abbreviation of the day of the week, such as Mon or Tue; and dddd 

156
Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
inserts the full name of the day of the week, such as Monday or Tuesday. The 
code yy inserts the last two digits of the year, such as 05 or 07; yyyy inserts 
all four digits of the year, such as 2005, 2007, and so on.
Time number formats use a series of abbreviations for the hour, minutes, 
and seconds. The code h inserts the number of the hour; hh inserts the 
number of the hour with leading zeros, such as 02 or 06. The code m inserts 
the minutes; the code mm inserts the minutes with leading zeros, such as 
01 or 09. The code s inserts the number of seconds; ss inserts the seconds 
with leading zeros, such as 03 or 08. Add AM/PM or am/pm to have Excel 
tell time on a 12-hour clock, and add either AM (or am) or PM (or pm) to the 
time number depending on whether the date is before or after noon. Without 
these AM/PM codes, Excel displays the time number on a 24-hour clock, just 
like the military does. (For example, 2:00 PM on a 12-hour clock is expressed 
as 1400 on a 24-hour clock.)
So that’s all you really need to know about making some sense of all those 
strange format codes that you see when you select the Custom category on 
the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box.
Designing your own number formats
Armed with a little knowledge on the whys and wherefores of interpreting 
Excel number format codes, you are ready to see how to use these codes to 
create your own custom number formats. The reason for going through all 
that code business is that, in order to create a custom number format, you 
have to type in your own codes.
To create a custom format, follow this series of steps:
 
1. Open a worksheet and enter a sample of the values or text to which 
you will be applying the custom format.
 
 If possible, apply the closest existing format to the sample value as 
you enter it in its cell (for example, if you’re creating a derivative of a 
Currency format, enter it with the dollar sign, commas, and decimal 
points that you know you’ll want in the custom format).
 
2. Open the Format Cells dialog box and use its categories to apply the 
closest existing number format to the sample cell.
 
3. Select Custom in the Category list box and then edit the codes applied 
by the existing number format that you chose in the Type list box 
until the value in the Sample section appears exactly as you want it.
What could be simpler? Ah, but Step 3, there’s the rub: editing weird format 
codes and getting them just right so that they produce exactly the kind of 
number formatting that you’re looking for!

Book II
Chapter 2

Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
Actually, creating your own number format isn’t as bad as it first sounds, 
because you “cheat” by selecting a number format that uses as many of the 
codes as possible that you need in the new custom number that you’re cre-
ating. Then you use the Sample area to keep a careful eye on the results as 
you edit the codes in the existing number format. For example, suppose that 
you want to create a custom date format to use on the current date that you 
enter with Excel’s built-in NOW function (see Book III, Chapter 3 for details). 
You want this date format to display the full name of the current month 
(January, February, and so on), followed by two digits for the date and four 
digits for the year, such as November 06, 2008.
To do this, use the Function Wizard to insert the current date into a work-
sheet cell; then with this cell selected, open the Format Cells dialog box and 
scroll down through the Custom category Type list box on the Number tab 
until you see the date codes m/d/yyyy h:mm. Highlight these codes and then 
edit them as follows in the Type text box directly above:
mmmm dd, yyyy
The mmmm format code inserts the full name of the month in the custom 
format; dd inserts two digits for the day (including a leading zero, like 02 
and 03); the yyyy code inserts the year. The other elements in this custom 
format are the space between the mmmm and dd codes and a comma and a 
space between the dd and yyyy codes (these being purely “punctuational” 
considerations in the custom format).
What if you want to do something even fancier and create a custom format 
that tells you something like “Today is Saturday, January 11, 2008” when 
you format a cell containing the NOW function? Well, you select your first 
custom format and add a little bit to the front of it, as follows:
“Today is” dddd, mmmm dd, yyyy
In this custom format, you’ve added two more elements: Today is and dddd. 
The Today is code tells Excel to enter the text between the quotation marks 
verbatim; the dddd code tells the program to insert the whole name of the 
day of the week. And you thought this was going to be a hard section!
Next, suppose that you want to create a really colorful number format — 
one that displays positive values in blue, negative values in red (what 
else?), zero values in green, and text in cyan. Further suppose that you want 
commas to separate groups of thousands in the values, no decimal places to 
appear (whole numbers only, please), and negative values to appear inside 
parentheses (instead of using that tiny little minus sign at the start). Sound 
complex? Hah, this is a piece of cake.

158
Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
Take four blanks cells in a new worksheet and enter 1200 in the first cell, 
-8000 in the second cell, 0 in the third cell, and the text Hello There! in the 
fourth cell. Then select all four cells as a range (starting with the one con-
taining 1200 as the first cell of the range). Open the Format Cells dialog box 
and select the Number tab and Number in the Category list. Then select the 
#,##0_);[Red](#,##0) code in the Custom category Type list box (it’s the sev-
enth set down from the top of the list box) and edit it as follows:
[Blue]#,##0_);[Red](#,##0);[Green];[Cyan]
Click OK. That’s all there is to that. When you return to the worksheet, the 
cell with 1200 appears in blue as 1,200, the -8000 appears in red as (8,000), 
the 0 appears in green, and the text “Hello There!” appears in a lovely cyan.
Before you move on, you should know about a particular custom format 
because it can come in really handy from time to time. I’m referring to the 
custom format that hides whatever has been entered in the cells. You can 
use this custom format to temporarily mask the display of confidential infor-
mation used in calculating the worksheet before you print and distribute the 
worksheet. This custom format provides an easy way to avoid distributing 
confidential and sensitive information while protecting the integrity of the 
worksheet calculations at the same time.
To create a custom format that masks the display of the data in a cell selec-
tion, you simply create an “empty” format that contains just the semicolon 
separators in a row:
;;;
This is one custom format that you can probably type by yourself!
After creating this format, you can blank out a range of cells simply by 
selecting them and then selecting this three-semicolon custom format in the 
Format Cells dialog box. To bring back a cell range that’s been blanked out 
with this custom format, simply select what now looks like blank cells and 
then select one of the other (visible) formats that are available. If the cell 
range contains text and values that normally should use a variety of different 
formats, first use General to make them visible. After the contents are back 
on display, format the cells in smaller groups or individually, as required.
Altering the alignment
You can use Excel’s Alignment options by using command buttons in the 
Alignment group of the Ribbon’s Home tab and by using options on the 
Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box to change the way cell entries 
are displayed within their cells.

Book II
Chapter 2
Formatting 
Worksheets
159
Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
Alignment refers to both the horizontal and vertical placement of the charac-
ters in an entry with regard to its cell boundaries as well as the orientation 
of the characters and how they are read. Horizontally, Excel automatically 
right-aligns all numeric entries and left-aligns all text entries in their cells 
(referred to as General alignment). Vertically, Excel aligns all types of cell 
entries with the bottom of their cells.
In the Horizontal drop-down list on the Alignment tab of the Format Cells 
dialog box, Excel offers you the following horizontal text alignment choices:
 
✦ General (the default) right-aligns a numeric entry and left-aligns a text 
entry in its cell.
 
✦ Left (Indent) left-aligns the entry in its cell and indents the characters 
from the left edge of the cell by the number of characters entered in the 
Indent combo box (which is 0 by default).
 
✦ Center centers any type of cell entry in its cell.
 
✦ Right (Indent) right-aligns the entry in its cell and indents the charac-
ters from the right edge of the cell by the number of characters entered 
in the Indent combo box (which is 0 by default).
 
✦ Fill repeats the entry until its characters fill the entire cell display. When 
you use this option, Excel automatically increases or decreases the repe-
titions of the characters in the cell as you adjust the width of its column.
 
✦ Justify spreads out a text entry with spaces so that the text is aligned 
with the left and right edges of its cell. If necessary to justify the text, 
Excel automatically wraps the text onto more than one line in the cell 
and increases the height of its row. If you use the Justify option on num-
bers, Excel left-aligns the values in their cells just as if you had selected 
the Left align option.
 
✦ Center Across Selection centers a text entry over selected blank cells in 
columns to the right of the cell entry.
 
✦ Distributed (Indent) indents the text in from the left and right cell 
margins by the amount you enter in the Indent text box or select with 
its spinner buttons (which appear when you select this option on the 
Horizontal drop-down list) and then distribute the text evenly in the 
space in between.
For text entries in the worksheet, you can also add the Wrap Text check box 
option to any of the horizontal alignment choices (note that you can also 
access this option by clicking the Wrap Text button in the Alignment group 
of the Home tab on the Ribbon). When you select the Wrap Text option, 
Excel automatically wraps the text entry to multiple lines within its cells 
while maintaining the type of alignment that you’ve selected (something that 
automatically happens when you select the Justify alignment option).

160
Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
Instead of wrapping text that naturally increases the row height to accom-
modate the additional lines, you can use the Shrink to Fit check box option 
on the Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box to have Excel reduce the 
size of the text in the cell sufficiently, so that all its characters fit within their 
current column widths.
In addition, Excel offers the following vertical text alignment options from 
the Vertical drop-down list:
 
✦ Top (the default) aligns any type of cell entry with the top edge of its cell.
 
✦ Center centers any type of cell entry between the top and bottom edges 
of its cell.
 
✦ Bottom aligns any type of cell entry with the bottom edge of its cell.
 
✦ Justify wraps the text of a cell entry on different lines spread out with 
blank space so that they are vertically aligned between the top and 
bottom edges of the cell.
 
✦ Distributed wraps the text of the cell entry on different lines distributed 
evenly between the top and bottom edges of its cell.
Finally, as part of its alignment options, Excel lets you alter the orientation 
(the angle of the characters in an entry in its cell) and text direction (the 
way the characters are read). The direction is left-to-right for European 
languages and right-to-left for some languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic 
(Chinese characters can also sometimes be read from right-to-left, as well).
Wrapping text entries to new lines in their cells
You can use the Wrap Text button on the Ribbon’s Home tab or the Wrap 
Text check box in the Text Control section of the Alignment tab to have 
Excel create a multi-line entry from a long text entry that would otherwise 
spill over to blank cells to the right. In creating a multi-line entry in a cell, the 
program also automatically increases the height of its row if that is required 
to display all the text.
To get an idea of how text wrap works in cells, compare Figures 2-15 and 
2-16. Figure 2-15 shows you two long text entries that spill over to succeed-
ing blank cells to the right. Figure 2-16 shows you these same entries after 
they have been formatted with the Wrap Text option. The first long text 
entry is in cell A1 and the second is in cell A3. They both use General align-
ment (same as Left for text) with the Wrap Text option.

When you create multi-line text entries with the Wrap Text option, you can 
decide where each line breaks by inserting a new paragraph. To do this, 
you put Excel in Edit mode by clicking the insertion point in the Formula 
bar at the place where a new line should start and pressing Alt+Enter. When 
you press the Enter key to return to Ready mode, Excel inserts an invisible 
paragraph marker at the insertion point that starts a new line both on the 
Formula bar and within the cell with the wrapped text.

Reorienting your entries
Excel makes it easy to change the orientation (that is, the angle of the base-
line on which the characters rest) of the characters in a cell entry by rotat-
ing up or down the baseline of the characters.
The Orientation command button in the Alignment group on the Ribbon’s 
Home tab contains the following options on its drop-down menu:
 
✦ Angle Counterclockwise rotates the text in the cell selection up 45 
degrees from the baseline.
 
✦ Angle Clockwise rotates the text in the cell selection down 45 degrees 
from the baseline.
 
✦ Vertical Text aligns the text in the cell selection in a column where one 
letter appears over the other.
 
✦ Rotate Text Up rotates the text in the cell selection up 90 degrees from 
the baseline.
 
✦ Rotate Text Down rotates the text in the cell selection down 90 degrees 
from the baseline.
 
✦ Format Cell Alignment opens the Alignment tab on the Format Cells 
dialog box.
You can also alter the orientation of text in the cell selection on the 
Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1) using the following 
options in its Orientation area:
 
✦ Enter the value of the angle of rotation for the new orientation in the 
Degrees text box or click the spinner buttons to select this angle. Enter 
a positive value (such as 45) to have the characters angled above the 
normal 90-degree line of orientation and a negative value (such as –45) 
to have them angled above this line.
 
✦ Click the point on the sample Text box on the right side of the 
Orientation area that corresponds to the angle of rotation that you want 
for the characters in the selected cells.
 
✦ Click the sample Text box on the left side of the Orientation area to have 
the characters stacked one on top of the other (as shown in the orienta-
tion of the word “Text” in this sample box).

Note how Excel increased the height of row 3 to accommodate this change.

Fancy fonts and colors
You can assign any of the fonts that you’ve installed for your printer to cells 
in a worksheet. Along with selecting a new font (also known as a typeface), 
you can choose a new font size (in points), assign a font style (such as bold, 
italic, underline, or strikethrough), as well as change the color of the font.
 
Note that you can always tell the font and font size of the cell entry in the 
active cell by looking at the font name displayed in the Font combo box and 
the point size displayed in the Font Size combo box in the Font group on the 
Home tab of the Ribbon. You can also tell which, if any, text attributes are 
assigned to the entry by looking at the Bold, Italic, and Underline buttons in 
this group. Excel indicates which of these attributes have been assigned to the 
cell by highlighting the B, I, or U button in the standard beige highlight color.
Selecting fonts and colors from the Ribbon
You can change the font, font size, font style, and font color using the com-
mand buttons in the Font group on the Home tab of the Ribbon. The only 
aspects you can’t change or assign are the type of the underlining (besides 
single or double) and special font styles including strikethrough, super-
script, and subscript.

164
Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
To change the font with the command buttons in the Font group on the 
Ribbon’s Home tab, select the cell, cell range, or nonadjacent selection to 
which you want to assign the new font, size, style, or color, and then do one 
of the following:
 
✦ To assign a new font to the selection, click the Font drop-down button 
and then click the font in the drop-down menu.
 
✦ To assign a new point size to the selection, click the Font Size pop-up 
button and then click the size on the pop-up menu (you can also do this 
by clicking the Font text box, typing the point size, and pressing Enter).
 
✦ To increase the font size a single point at a time, click the Increase Font 
Size button.
 
✦ To decrease the font size a single point at a time, click the Decrease Font 
Size button.
 
✦ To assign a new font style to a selection, click the appropriate tool in the 
Formatting toolbar: Click the Bold button (the one with B) to bold the 
selection, the Italic button (the one with I) to italicize the selection, and 
the Underline button (the one with the U) to underline the selection — 
to assign double underlining to the cell selection, click the drop-down 
button attached to the Underline button and then click Double Underline 
on its drop-down menu.
 
✦ To assign a new font color, click the Font Color pop-up button and then 
click the new color in the drop-down palette.
 
Live Preview enables you to see how the cell selection looks in a font or font 
size that you highlight on the Font or Font-Size drop-down menu — pro-
vided, of course, that the selection is not in the columns and rows obscured 
when these drop-down menus are displayed.
 
Note that you can immediately remove any font change that you make 
by clicking the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar (or by pressing 
Ctrl+Z). You can also remove boldface, italics, and underlining assigned to a 
cell selection by clicking the appropriate button (Bold, Italic, and Underline) 
on the Formatting toolbar. This action removes the golden box that outlines 
the button’s B, I, or U icon.
Selecting fonts and colors in the Format Cells dialog box
You can also select a new font, font size, font style, and font color for your 
selection in the Font tab of the Format Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1). Figure 2-18 
shows the Font tab of the Format Cells dialog box that appears when an 
empty cell that uses the Normal style is active in Excel 2010 on a computer 
running Windows 7 or Vista. In this figure, the current Font is Calibri (Body), 
the Font Style is Regular, the Font Size is 11 (points), the Underline is None, 
and the Color is Automatic (in Excel 2010 running on Windows XP, the font is 
Arial and the font size is 10 points).

To select a new font color from the Font Color drop-down palette in the 
Font group on the Ribbon’s Home tab or from the Color drop-down palette 
on the Font tab of the Format Cells dialog box, click its drop-down button. 
Both drop-down palettes contain color swatches arranged in two groups: 
Theme colors to select one of the colors used in Excel’s themes (see Book V, 
Chapter 2) and Standard colors to select one of the primary Windows colors. 
To select a font color from either of these two groups, click its color swatch.
If none of the preset colors will do, click the More Colors option at the 
bottom of the drop-down palette to open the Colors dialog box. This dialog 
box contains a Standard tab where you can select a new color by clicking its 
hexagram swatch in the color honeycomb or shade of gray hexagram below. 
The Custom tab enables you to select a custom color by changing the RGB 
(Red, Green, and Blue) or HSL (Hue, Saturation, and Luminosity) values. You 
can do this either by dragging through the color grid and tint slider at the 
top of the Custom tab or by entering new values in the Red, Green, and Blue 
(when the RGB Color Model is selected) or the Hue, Sat, and Lum (when the 
HSL Color Model is selected) text boxes below or by selecting them with 
their spinner buttons.
 
Note that Excel adds a swatch for each custom color you select or define to 
a Recent Colors section that then appears on both the Font Color and Fill 
Color buttons’ drop-down palettes, making it easy to apply these custom 
colors to the text and fills of other cells in the worksheet.
Basic borders, fills, and patterns
Excel makes it easy to add borders as well as to assign new background fill 
colors, gradients, and shading patterns to cells in the worksheet. You can 
use the borders to outline tables of data — particularly important cells — or 
to underscore rows of key data. You can also apply various color gradients 
and shading patterns to cells to draw attention to significant aspects of the 
spreadsheet.

166
Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
 
When adding borders and shading, you can make your job a great deal 
easier by removing the gridlines used in the Worksheet area to indicate the 
borders of the cells in the worksheet. To remove these gridlines, click the 
Gridlines check box on the View tab of the Ribbon (or press Alt+WVG). After 
you’ve dispensed with a worksheet’s gridlines, you can immediately tell 
whether you’ve added the kind of borders that you want and better judge 
the effect of the color and shading changes that you make.
 
Note that removing the display of the gridlines in the Workbook window 
has no effect whatsoever on the appearance of gridlines in a printed copy of 
the spreadsheet. If you turn on gridlines for a printout by clicking the Print 
check box in the Gridlines column of the Sheet Options group on the Page 
Layout tab (or press Alt+PPG) to add a check mark to this check box, Excel 
prints these lines on the printed version of the worksheet even when they do 
not appear on-screen.
Right on the borderline
When applying borderlines to a cell selection, you have a choice between 
using the options on the drop-down menu that’s attached to the Borders 
button in the Font group on the Home tab and using the options on the 
Border tab of the Format Cells dialog box. You can compare the options 
offered by each in Figures 2-19 and 2-20. Figure 2-19 shows the border 
options on the drop-down menu and Figure 2-20 shows the options on the 
Border tab of the Format Cells dialog box.

To apply borders to the cell selection by using the options on the Borders 
button’s drop-down menu, click the option on the menu with the type of 
border you want drawn. To remove a borderline that you select in error, 
simply click the No Border option at the top of this drop-down menu.

While defining the borderlines to apply in the Border tab, you can select a 
new style for the borderlines by clicking the Line style in the Style sample 
area. To select a new color (besides boring old black) for the borderlines 
that you’re about to apply, click the swatch of the new color you want to use 
in the Color drop-down palette.
When using the Borders palettes to assign borderlines to a cell selection, 
your options are limited to just the Border buttons displayed on the palette. 
This means that you don’t have as much choice in terms of line style and 
type of borderlines (in other words, you can’t be applying any dashed diago-
nal borderlines from this palette). You also can’t change the color of the bor-
derlines from the Borders palette.
Changing the Automatic color
The Automatic color in Excel always refers 
to the Window Font color that is currently 
selected in the Window Color and Appearance 
dialog box (called the Advanced Appearance 
dialog box in Windows Vista and Windows XP). 
This color is black unless you change it in this 
dialog box.
To open the Window Color and Appearance 
dialog box in Windows 7, right-click the desktop 
and then click Personalize on the shortcut 
menu; click the Window Color button and then 
click the Advanced Appearance Settings link.
In the Window Color and Appearance dialog 
box, click Window at the very bottom of the 
Item drop-down menu and then click a new 
color on the Color drop-down palette in the last 
row (opposite Font) immediately above the OK 
and Cancel buttons. Click OK.

Keep in mind that the Borders button’s drop-down menu includes a couple 
of options that enable you to literally draw borders around a cell selection in 
your worksheet by dragging the mouse pointer through the cells. Select the 
Draw Border option to draw a border just outlining the cells you select or 
Draw Border Grid to draw borders around each and every cell you select 
with the mouse.
 
To get rid of borderlines that you’ve added to a cell range, no matter which 
method you used to add them, select the range and then click the No Border 
option on the Borders button’s drop-down menu.
Fun fills, great-looking gradients, and pretty patterns
In Excel 2010, you can not only select new background colors (referred to as 
fill colors) for the cell selection but you can also assign gradients (fills that 
gradually go from one color to another) and new dotted and crosshatched 
patterns to them.
When simply assigning a new fill color to the current cell selection, you can 
do this either by clicking a new color swatch on the Fill Color button’s drop-
down palette (located in the Font group on the Ribbon’s Home tab) or by 
clicking the swatch in the Background Color area of the Fill tab in the Format 
Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1) shown in Figure 2-21.

open the Fill Effects dialog box (see Figure 2-22). Select the beginning 
gradient color by clicking its swatch on the Color 1 drop-down color pal-
ette and the ending gradient color by clicking its swatch on the Color 2 
drop-down palette. Note that you can then further refine the gradient by 
selecting a new shading style option button that determines the direc-
tion of the gradient pattern before you click OK.

shading pattern (which is by default the black Automatic color), click a 
color swatch on the Pattern Color’s drop-down palette.
 
Check the Sample area at the bottom of the Fill tab of the Format Cells dialog 
box to check out the shading pattern and make sure that it’s the one you 
want to use before you click OK to apply it to the cell selection. If you don’t 
like the effect after you’ve applied it to the cell selection, click the Undo 
button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z immediately to remove it.

Hiring Out the Format Painter
The Format Painter button (with paintbrush icon) in the Clipboard group of 
the Home tab takes formatting from the current cell and applies it to cells 
that you “paint” by dragging its special thick-white-cross-plus-paintbrush 
mouse pointer through them. This tool, therefore, provides a quick-and-easy 
way to take a bunch of different formats (such as a new font, font size, bold, 
and italics) that you applied individually to a cell in the spreadsheet and then 
turn around and use them as the guide for formatting a new range of cells.
To use the Format Painter, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in a cell that contains the formatting that you 
want copied to another range of cells in the spreadsheet.

170
Using Cell Styles
 
 This cell becomes the sample cell whose formatting is taken up by 
Format Painter and copied in the cells that “paint” with its special 
mouse pointer.
 
2. Click the Format Painter button (with the paintbrush icon) in the 
Clipboard group on the Home tab of the Ribbon.
 
 As soon as you click this button, Excel adds a paintbrush icon to the 
standard thick white-cross mouse pointer, indicating that the Format 
Painter is ready to copy the formatting from the sample cell.
 
3. Drag the mouse pointer through the range of cells that you want for-
matted identically to the sample cell.
The moment that you release the mouse button, the cells in the range that 
you just selected with the Format Painter become formatted the same way 
as the sample cell.
 
Normally, using the Format Painter is a one-shot deal because as soon as 
you release the mouse button after selecting a range of cells with the Format 
Painter, it turns off, and the mouse pointer reverts back to its normal func-
tion of just selecting cells in the worksheet (indicated by the return of the 
regular thick white-cross icon). If you ever want to keep the Format Painter 
turned on so that you can use it to format more than one range of cells in the 
worksheet, you need to double-click the Format Painter button on the Home 
tab instead of just single-clicking it. When you do this, the Format Painter 
button remains depressed (indicated by the orange highlight) on the Home 
tab until you click its command button again. During this time, you can 
“paint” as many different cell ranges in the worksheet as you desire.
Using Cell Styles
Cell styles combine a number of different formatting aspects that can 
include number format, text alignment, font and font size, borders, fills, and 
protection status (see Book IV, Chapter 1).
In Excel 2010, cell styles really come alive in the form of the Cell Styles gal-
lery that you open by clicking the Cell Styles button in the Styles group on 
the Ribbon’s Home tab.
The Cell Styles gallery contains loads of readymade styles you can imme-
diately apply to the current cell selection. These predefined cell styles are 
arranged into various sections: Good, Bad, and Neutral; Data and Model; 
Titles and Headings; Themed Cell Styles; and Number Format.
To apply one of the styles on the Cell Styles gallery, simply click the thumb-
nail of the desired style in the gallery after using the Live Preview feature to 
determine which style looks best on the data in your cell selection.

Using the Number Format cell styles
The Number Format section near the bottom of the Cell Styles gallery (see 
Figure 2-23) contains the following five predefined styles that you can use to 
format the values entered into the cell selection as follows:
 
✦ Comma sets the number format to the Comma Style (same as clicking the 
Comma Style command button in the Number group of the Home tab).
 
✦ Comma (0) sets the number format to the Comma Style format without 
any decimal places.
 
✦ Currency sets the number format to the Currency style format (same as 
clicking the Accounting Number Format command button in the Number 
group of the Home tab).
 
✦ Currency (0) sets the number format to the Currency style format 
without any decimal places (making your financial figures all dollars 
and no cents).
 
✦ Percent sets the number format to Percent style (same as clicking the 
Percent Style command button in the Number group of the Home tab).

Using Cell Styles
 
You can combine the number formatting assigned from one of the Number 
Format cell styles with the other cell formatting assigned by the cell styles in 
the other three cell style groups: the Good, Bad, and Neutral (except for 
Normal which applies the General number format); Data and Model; and 
Themed Cell Styles. To do this, however, assign the number formatting by 
clicking its style in the Number Format section of the Cell Styles gallery 
before you assign the other formatting by clicking its style in one of the 
other three sections of the Cell Styles gallery.
 
Click Normal, the first style in the Good, Bad, and Neutral section, in the 
Cell Styles gallery to return the formatting in the cell selection to its original 
state: General number format, left or right (depending on the contents), 
horizontal and bottom vertical alignment, Calibri (body) or Arial font, 11- or 
10-point font size (depending on the operating system, Windows 7 and Vista 
or Windows XP), no borders, no fill, and locked protection status.
Defining a custom cell style by example
You don’t have to live with just the predefined styles that Excel gives you on 
the Cell Styles gallery because you can readily create custom cell styles of 
your own.
By far the easiest way to create a new custom cell style is by example. When 
you create a cell style by example, you choose a cell that already displays all 
the formatting attributes (applied separately using the techniques discussed 
previously in this chapter) that you want included in the new cell style. 
Then, you follow these simple steps to create the new style by using the for-
matting in the sample cell:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in the cell with the formatting that you want in 
the new style.
 
2. Click the New Cell Style option at the bottom of the Cell Styles drop-
down gallery (opened by clicking the Cell Styles button in the Styles 
group on the Ribbon’s Home tab).
 
 This action opens the Style dialog box with a generic style name (Style 1, 
Style 2, and so on), and the formatting attributes applied to the cell are 
listed in the Style Includes (By Example) section of the dialog box.
 
3. Type the name for the new style in the Style Name text box (replacing 
the Style 1, Style 2, generic style name).
 
4. Click OK to close the Style dialog box.
 
When defining a style by example, select only one cell that you know con-
tains all the formatting characteristics that you want in the new style. This 
way, you avoid the potential problem of selecting cells that don’t share the 
same formatting. If you select cells that use different formatting when defin-
ing a style by example, the new style will contain only the formatting that all 
cells share in common.

Using Cell Styles
 
After you close the Style dialog box, Excel adds a thumbnail for the new style 
to a Custom section at the top of the Cell Styles gallery. To apply this new 
custom cell style to other cell selections in the worksheet, all you have to do 
is click its thumbnail in the Custom section of the gallery.
Creating a new cell style from scratch
You can also create a custom cell style from scratch by defining each of its 
formatting characteristics in the Style dialog box as follows:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in a cell that doesn’t have any formatting 
applied to it and then click the New Cell Style option at the bottom of 
the Cell Styles drop-down gallery (opened by clicking the Cell Styles 
button in the Styles group on the Ribbon’s Home tab).
 
 This action opens the Style dialog box with a generic style name (Style 1, 
Style 2, and so on), and with the attributes for the Normal style listed in 
the Style Includes (By Example) section of the dialog box.
 
2. Type a name for the new style that you are defining in the Style Name 
text box (replacing Style 1, Style 2, generic style name).
 
 Now you need to select the formatting settings for the new style.
 
3. (Optional) Click the check box for any attribute (Number, Alignment, 
Font, Border, Fill, or Protection) that you don’t want included in the 
new style.
 
4. Click the Format button in the Style dialog box.
 
 This action opens the standard Format Cells dialog box, where you can 
use the options on its six tabs (Number, Alignment, Font, Border, Fill, 
and Protection) to select all the formatting attributes that you do want 
used when you apply the new style to a cell selection.
 
5. After you finish assigning the formatting attributes that you want in 
the new style in the Format Cells dialog box, click OK to return to the 
Style dialog box.
 
 The Style Includes (By Example) section now lists all the attributes that 
you assigned in the Format Cells dialog box.
 
6. Click OK to close the Style dialog box.
As soon as you click OK, Excel applies the formatting in your newly defined 
custom style to the current cell and adds the new style to the Custom sec-
tion of the Cell Styles gallery. To apply this new custom cell style to other 
cell selections in the worksheet, all you have to do is click its thumbnail in 
the Custom section of the gallery.

174
Using Cell Styles
 
To remove a custom style from the Cell Styles gallery that you’ve defined by 
example or from scratch, you have to right-click its thumbnail in the gallery 
and then click Delete on its shortcut menu. 
Merging styles into other workbooks
All custom cell styles that you create are saved, along with the data and for-
matting in the worksheet, when you save the file. The only styles, however, 
that are available when you begin a new worksheet are those predefined 
styles provided by Excel.
If you’ve created custom styles in another workbook that you want to use 
in a new workbook or in an existing one that you’ve opened for editing, you 
have to merge them into that workbook as follows:
 
1. Open the workbook file containing the custom styles that you want to 
copy and use.
 
 You must have the workbook containing the custom styles to merge open, 
along with the workbook into which these custom styles will be copied.
 
2. Click the button on the Windows taskbar for the workbook file into 
which the custom styles will be merged.
 
 This action makes the workbook into which the custom styles are to be 
copied the active one.
 
3. Click the Merge Styles option at the bottom of the Cell Styles drop-
down gallery (opened by clicking the Cell Styles button in the Styles 
group on the Ribbon’s Home tab).
 
 Excel opens the Merge Styles dialog box with a list box that displays the 
filenames of the all the workbooks that currently open in the program.
 
4. Click the name of the workbook that contains the custom styles you 
want merged into the active workbook and then click OK.
 
 This action closes the Merge Styles dialog box. If the worksheet file that 
you selected contains custom styles with the same names as the custom 
styles defined in the active worksheet, Excel displays an alert box that 
asks if you want to merge the styles that have the same names. Click Yes 
to replace all styles in the active workbook with those that have the same 
name in the workbook file that you’re copying from. Click No if you don’t 
want the styles in the active workbook to be overwritten, in which case 
Excel merges the styles with unique names from the other worksheet.
After merging styles from another open workbook, you can close that 
workbook by clicking its button on the Windows taskbar and then clicking 
its Close Window. You can then begin applying the merged custom styles, 
which now appear in the Custom section at the top of the Cell Styles gallery, 
to cell selections by clicking their thumbnails in the gallery.

Conditional Formatting
Excel 2010’s Conditional Formatting feature enables you to format a range of 
values so that unusual or unwanted values, or values outside certain limits, 
are automatically formatted in such a way as to call attention to them.
When you click the Conditional Formatting button in the Styles group on the 
Ribbon’s Home tab, a drop-down menu appears with the following options:
 
✦ Highlight Cells Rules opens a continuation menu with various options 
for defining formatting rules that highlight the cells in the cell selection 
that contain certain values, text, or dates, or that have values greater or 
less than a particular value, or that fall within a certain ranges of values.
 
✦ Top/Bottom Rules opens a continuation menu with various options for 
defining formatting rules that highlight the top and bottom values, per-
centages, and above and below average values in the cell selection.
 
✦ Data Bars opens a palette with different color data bars that you can 
apply to the cell selection to indicate their values relative to each other 
by clicking the data bar thumbnail.
 
✦ Color Scales opens a palette with different three- and two-colored scales 
that you can apply to the cell selection to indicate their values relative 
to each other by clicking the color scale thumbnail.
 
✦ Icon Sets opens a palette with different sets of icons that you can apply 
to the cell selection to indicate their values relative to each other by 
clicking the icon set.
 
✦ New Rule opens the New Formatting Rule dialog box, where you define a 
custom conditional formatting rule to apply to the cell selection.
 
✦ Clear Rules opens a continuation menu, where you can remove con-
ditional formatting rules for the cell selection by clicking the Selected 
Cells option, for the entire worksheet by clicking the Entire Sheet option, 
or for just the current data table by clicking the This Table option.
 
✦ Manage Rules opens the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog 
box, where you edit and delete particular rules as well as adjust their 
rule precedence by moving them up or down in the Rules list box.
Graphical conditional formatting
Perhaps the coolest (and certainly easiest) conditional formatting that you 
can apply to a cell range is with the sets of graphical markers pop-up pal-
ettes attached to the Data Bars, Color Scales, and Icon Sets options on the 
Conditional Formatting button’s drop-down menu:

176
Conditional Formatting
 
✦ Data Bars represents the relative values in the cell selection by the 
length of the color bar in each cell — data bars are a great way to 
quickly pinpoint the lower and higher values within a large range of 
data.
 
✦ Color Scales classify the relative values in a cell selection with a color 
gradation using a one-, two-, or three-color scale — color scales are 
great for identifying the distribution of values across a large range of 
data.
 
✦ Icon Sets classify the values in the cell selection into three to five cat-
egories and each icon within the set represents a range of values that go 
from high to low — icon sets are great for quickly identifying the differ-
ent ranges of values in a range of data.
Figure 2-24 shows how the Data Bars option appears when applied to a cell 
selection in the cell range C2:C29 that contains a simple series of whole num-
bers, ranging from 0 to 27. The Data Bars increase in length as the numbers 
increase, creating, in effect, a data bar chart in column C.

Conditional Formatting
Identifying particular values or 
text entries in a cell range
The options attached to the Highlight Cell Rules and Top/Bottom Rules 
items on the Conditional Formatting button’s drop-down menu enable you to 
specify a particular type of formatting when certain conditions are met.
The rules that you set up for meeting these formatting conditions can vary 
widely. You can set up a rule whereby a particular type of formatting is 
applied when a cell in the range contains a certain text entry (such as Fixed 
or Variable). You set up a rule whereby a particular type of formatting is 
applied when a cell in the range is exactly a particular value or exceeds or 
falls below a particular value. So too, you can set up a rule whereby a par-
ticular type of formatting is applied when the value is one of the top ten in 
the range, is below the average value in the range, or falls into the lower ten 
percent.
For example, to set up the rule that Excel formats any cell within a range 
with a light red fill color and dark red font color whenever it contains the 
word “Fixed,” you follow these steps:
 
1. Select the range of cells in the worksheet to which this conditional for-
matting rule is to be applied.
 
2. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Ribbon’s Home tab 
and then choose Highlight Cell Rules on the drop-down menu and 
click Text That Contains on the continuation menu.
 
 Excel opens the Text That Contains dialog box with a text box on the left 
where you enter or select in the worksheet the text that tells Excel when 
to apply the conditional formatting and a drop-down list box on the right 
where you select or define the conditional formatting the program is to 
apply.
 
3. Type Fixed in the Format Cells That Contain the Text box.
 
 In this case, you don’t have to change the formatting in the drop-down 
list box as Light Red Fill with Dark Red Text is the default formatting.
 
4. Click OK to apply the conditional formatting rule to the selected cell 
range.
Say you wanted to apply three different types of conditional formatting to 
the cells in a single range of the worksheet: one type of formatting when-
ever a cell in the range contains a target value, another when it exceeds this 
target value, and third when it falls below the target value.

yellow font to cells in a range when they contain 100,000, a green fill with 
dark green text when they’re greater than 100,000, and a light red fill with 
dark red text when they’re less than 100,000:
 
1. Select the range of cells in the worksheet to which the three condi-
tional formatting rules are to be applied.
 
 Start by defining the rule that applies yellow fill with dark yellow font to 
all values in the range that are equal to 100,000.
 
2. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab and then 
highlight Highlight Cell Rules on the drop-down menu and click Equal 
To on the continuation menu.
 
 Excel opens the Equal To dialog box (shown in Figure 2-25), where you 
define the formatting rule when a cell contains 100,000.
 
3. Type 100,000 in the Format Cells That Are EQUAL TO text box and 
then click Yellow Fill with Dark Yellow Text in the drop-down list box 
to the right before you click OK.
 
 Next, you define the rule that applies green fill with dark green font to all 
values that are greater than 100,000.
 
4. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab and then 
choose Highlight Cell Rules on the drop-down menu and click Greater 
Than on the continuation menu.
 
 Excel opens the Greater Than dialog box where you define the format-
ting rule when a cell contains a value higher than 100,000.
 
5. Type 100,000 in the Format Cells That Are GREATER THAN text box 
and then click Green Fill with Dark Green Text in the drop-down list 
box to the right before you click OK.

 Finally, you define the rule that applies red fill with dark red font to all 
values that are less than 100,000.

6. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab and then 
choose Highlight Cell Rules on the drop-down menu and click Less 
Than on the continuation menu.
 
 Excel opens the Less Than dialog box where you define the formatting 
rule when a cell contains a value below 100,000.
 
7. Type 100,000 in the Format Cells That Are LESS THAN text box and 
then leave the default Light Red Fill with Dark Red Text selected in 
the drop-down list box to the right when you click OK.
As you define the three rules, Excel applies them to the range selected in 
the worksheet. If the cell range is blank at the time you set up these three 
rules, all the blank cells in the range are given a red fill. As you enter values 
into the cells, their text takes on the color assigned to their values: dark red 
font for values below 100,000, dark yellow for all values of 100,000, and dark 
green for all values above 100,000. In addition, when the values are equal to 
100,000, Excel fills the cell with a light yellow background color and when 
values are above 100,000, a light green background color.
Finally, here are the steps you’d follow to create a rule that formats all 
values in a cell range that are below the average value in the range with a 
custom conditional format that applies bold italic to the font and a bright 
yellow fill color:
 
1. Select the range of cells in the worksheet to which this conditional for-
matting rule is to be applied.
 
2. Click the Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab and then 
highlight Top/Bottom Rules on the drop-down menu and click Below 
Average on the continuation menu.
 
 Excel opens the Below Average dialog box that contains a single drop-
down list box where you define the formatting to be used when a value 
is below the calculated average for the cell range.
 
3. Click Custom Format at the bottom of the Format Cells That Are 
BELOW AVERAGE drop-down list box.
 
 Excel opens the Format Cells dialog box where you define all the attri-
butes to be part of the custom conditional formatting.
 
4. Click the Font tab in the Format Cells dialog box and then click Bold 
Italic in the Font Style list box.
 
5. Click the Fill tab in the Format Cells dialog box and then click the 
bright yellow swatch in the Background Color section before you 
click OK.

Conditional Formatting
 
 Excel closes the Format Cells dialog box, returning you to the Below 
Average dialog box, which now displays Custom Format in the Format 
Cells That Are BELOW AVERAGE drop-down list box.
 
6. Click OK to close the Below Average dialog box.
Excel then applies the custom formatting of bold italic text with bright 
yellow fill color to all values in the cell selection that are below the calcu-
lated average (displayed after the Average heading on the Status bar at the 
bottom of the Excel program window).
Highlighting duplicate values in a cell range
The Duplicate Values option on the Highlight Cells Rules continuation menu 
enables you to highlight duplicate values within a selected cell range.
To highlight duplicate values in a cell range, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the range of cells in the worksheet where you want duplicates 
formatted in a special way.
 
2. Click the Conditional Formatting button in the Styles group of the 
Home tab of the Ribbon; then highlight the Highlight Cells Rules 
option on the drop-down menu and click Duplicate Values on the con-
tinuation menu.
 
 Excel opens the Duplicate Values Columns dialog box containing two 
drop-down list boxes: the first where you indicate whether Excel is to 
format identical values (Duplicate, the default) in the range or the stand-
alone values (Unique) in the range, and the second where you indicate the 
type of formatting applied to either the duplicates or one-of-a-kind values.
 
3. Click the type of preset formatting (Red Fill with Dark Red Text, 
Yellow Fill with Dark Yellow Text, Green Fill with Dark Green Text, 
and so forth) or click the Custom Format option and select the custom 
formatting in the Format Cells dialog box.
 
 If you define a custom format rather than select one of the preset for-
mats, use the options on the Number, Font, Border, and Fill tabs of the 
Format Cells dialog box to designate all the formatting to be applied, 
and then click OK to close the Format Cells dialog box and return to the 
Compare Columns dialog box (where Custom Format appears in the 
third drop-down list box).
 
4. Click OK to close the Duplicate Values dialog box.
Excel then formats all the cells in the selected cell range whose values are 
exact duplicates with the conditional formatting you selected.

Creating your own conditional formatting rules
Although Excel 2010 gives you a ton of readymade Highlight Cells Rules and 
Top/Bottom Rules to define, you may still find that you need to create your 
own rules for conditional formatting. To do this, you click the New Rule 
option near the bottom of the Conditional Formatting button’s drop-down 
menu or you click the New Rule button in the Conditional Formatting Rules 
Manager dialog box (see the “Managing conditional formatting rules” section 
that immediately follows).
Figure 2-26 shows you the New Formatting Rule dialog box as it first appears 
after clicking the New Rule option or button. To create a new conditional 
formatting rule, you first click the type of rule to create in the Select a Rule 
Type list box and then specify the criteria and define the formatting using 
the various options that appear in the Edit the Rule Description section 
below — note that these options vary greatly depending on the type of rule 
you click in the Select a Rule Type list box above.
 
Figure 2-26:

Select the Use a Formula to Determine Which Cells to Format rule type 
when you want to build a formula as the rule that determines when a par-
ticular type of conditional formatting is applied. Note that this formula can 
refer to cells outside the current cell selection to which the conditional 
formatting is applied, but it must be a logical formula, meaning that it uses 
comparison operators (see Book III, Chapter 1) and/or Logical functions 
(see Book III, Chapter 2) that when calculated return either a logical TRUE or 
FALSE value.

Managing conditional formatting rules
The Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box (see Figure 2-27), 
which you open by clicking the Manage Rules option at the very bottom of 
the Conditional Formatting button’s drop-down menu, enables you to do all 
of the following:
 
✦ Create new rules by clicking the New Rule button to open the New 
Formatting Rule dialog box (see the “Creating your own conditional for-
matting rules” section immediately preceding).
 
✦ Edit existing rules by selecting the rule in the Rule list box and clicking 
the Edit Rule button in the Editing Formatting Rule dialog box (which 
looks just like the New Formatting Rule dialog box except it contains the 
rule type, criteria, and formatting for the particular rule you selected).
 
✦ Delete rules by clicking the rule in the Rule list box and then clicking the 
Delete Rule button — click the Apply button to remove formatting from 
the worksheet that was applied to the rule you just deleted.
 
✦ Change the order of precedence in which multiple conditional format-
ting rules assigned to the same cell selection or table are applied by pro-
moting or demoting individual rules in the Rule list box by clicking the 
rules and then clicking either the Move Up button (with the thick arrow 
pointing upward) or Move Down button (with the thick arrow pointing 
downward) until the rules appear in the desired order of precedence.

By default, the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box shows all the 
rules assigned only to the current cell selection or table. To see all the condi-
tional formatting rules in a particular worksheet or table, click its name on the 
Show Formatting Rules For drop-down list at the top of the dialog box.
 
A rule that appears higher in the Rule list box of the Conditional Formatting 
Rules Manager dialog box has a higher precedence and is therefore applied 
before one lower in the list. When more than one rule is true, what happens 
depends on whether or not the formatting applied by those rules conflict. 
When they don’t conflict (as when one rule formats the cells in bold italic 
and the other formats the cells with a light red fill), both formats are applied. 
However, when the formats conflict (as when one rule formats the cells with 
black fill and bright yellow text and the other formats the cells with yellow 
fill and black text), the rule with the higher precedence wins and only its 
conditional formatting is applied.

reating a spreadsheet is seldom a one-time experience. In fact, some of 
the spreadsheets that you create with Excel require routine changes on 
a regular basis, whereas others require more radical changes only once in a 
while. Regardless of the extent of the changes and their frequency, you can 
be sure that sooner or later, most of the spreadsheets you create in Excel 
will require editing.
In this chapter, you find out how to make simple editing changes in a work-
sheet by modifying the contents of a cell as well as how to do more complex 
editing in your worksheets. These techniques include how to use the Undo 
and Redo feature, zoom in and out on data, move and copy data, delete data 
entries and insert new ones, search and replace data entries, and proof the 
contents of the final worksheet.
However, before you can use any of these fine editing techniques, you have 
to open the workbook whose contents require editing. So, with that in mind, 
this chapter starts out by giving you the lowdown on finding and opening 
workbooks in Excel.
Opening a Workbook
One of the simplest ways to open a workbook for editing in Excel is to open 
its folder in Windows and then double-click the workbook file icon. If you 

186
Opening a Workbook
haven’t yet started Excel at the time you open the workbook, Windows auto-
matically launches Excel at the same time that it opens the file. Remember 
that you can use the Documents or Computer Start menu options (when 
running Excel 2010 on Windows 7 or Vista) and the My Documents or My 
Computer Start menu or desktop shortcuts (when running Excel 2010 on 
Windows XP) to locate and then open your workbook files.
 
Keep in mind that Excel automatically saves workbook files in your 
Documents folder (when running the program on Windows 7 or Vista) and 
the My Documents folder (when running the program on Windows XP) 
unless you specifically select another folder.
If Excel is already running and you want to open a workbook file for editing 
from within Excel, you can click File➪Open or press Alt+FO to launch the 
Open dialog box and locate and open the file.
If you can’t remember where you saved the workbook that you need to edit 
(a common occurrence) and you’re running Excel 2010 on Windows 7 or 
Vista, you can use the Search Documents text box in the Open dialog box 
to locate the file, so you can open it right from within the dialog box. See 
the “Searching for workbooks when running Excel on Windows 7 or Vista” 
section later in this chapter for details. (If you’re running Excel 2010 on 
Windows XP, you need to use the Windows Search feature on the Start menu 
to find the workbook file and then open it from the Search Results window 
outside of Excel — see “Searching for workbooks when running Excel on 
Windows XP” later in this chapter for details.)
The Open dialog box in Excel 2010 
running on Windows 7 or Vista
If you’re running Excel 2010 on Windows 7 or Vista, an Open dialog box very 
much like the one in Figure 3-1 appears. This dialog box is divided into two 
panes: the Navigation pane on the left where you can select a new folder to 
open, and the main pane on the right showing the icons for all the subfolders 
in the current folder as well as the documents that Excel can open.
This current folder, whose contents are displayed in the Open dialog box, is 
either the one designated as the Default File Location on the Save tab of the 
Excel Options dialog box or the folder you last opened during your current 
Excel work session.
To open a workbook in another folder, click its link in the Libraries or 
Favorite Links section of the Navigation pane or click the Expand Folders 
button (the one with the triangle pointing upward) and click its folder in 
this list.

If you open a new folder and it appears empty of all files (and you know that 
it’s not an empty folder), this just means the folder doesn’t contain any of 
the types of files that Excel can open directly, such as workbooks, template 
files, and macro sheets. To display all the files, whether or not Excel can 
open them directly (meaning without some sort of conversion), click the 
drop-down button that appears next to the drop-down list box that currently 
contains Microsoft Office Excel Files and click All Files on its drop-down 
menu.
When the icon for the workbook file you want to work with appears in the 
Open dialog box, you can then open it either by clicking its file icon and then 
clicking the Open button or, if you’re handy with the mouse, by just double-
clicking the file icon.
 
Keep in mind that you can use the slider attached to the Change Your View 
drop-down list button located on the right side of the toolbar at the top of 
the Open dialog box to change the way folder and file icons appear in the 
dialog box. When you select Large Icons or Extra Large Icons on this slider 
(or anywhere in between), the Excel workbook icons actually show data in 
the upper-left corner of the first worksheet. This applies to all Excel 2010 
workbooks saved with the Save Thumbnail check box selected and Excel 97 
through 2003 workbooks saved with the Save Preview Picture check box on 
the Summary tab of the workbook’s Properties dialog box selected. This pre-
view of part of the first sheet helps you quickly identify the workbook you 
want to open for editing or printing.

The Open dialog box in Excel 2010 
running on Windows XP
The Open dialog box that appears when running Excel 2010 under Windows 
XP is divided into two sections: a My Places panel on the left and a folder 
and file list box on the right.
When you can’t find the filename you’re looking for in the list box, check to 
make sure that you’re looking in the right folder — because if you’re not, 
you’re never going to find the missing file. To tell which folder is currently 
open, check the Look In drop-down list box at the top of the Open dialog box.
If the folder that is currently open is not the one that has the workbook file 
you need to use, you then need to open the folder that does contain the 
file. In Excel, you can use the Up One Level button in the Open dialog box 
to change levels until you see the folder you want to open in the list box. 
To open the new folder, click its icon in the list box and then click the Open 
button or press Enter (or you can just double-click its icon).
If the workbook file you want is on another drive, click the Up One Level 
button until the C: drive icon appears in the Look In drop-down list box. You 
can then switch drives by clicking the drive icon in the list box and then 
choosing the Open button or pressing Enter (or you can just double-click the 
drive icon).
When you locate the file you want to use in the list box in the Open dialog 
box, open it by clicking its file icon and then clicking the Open button or 
pressing Enter (or by double-clicking the file icon).
Use the buttons displayed in the My Places panel on the left side of the Open 
dialog box (My Recent Documents, Desktop, My Documents, My Computer, 
and My Network Places) to easily open any folders associated with these 
buttons that contain workbook files:
 
✦ My Recent Documents: Click this button to open workbook files you 
save in the Recent folder (located inside the Office folder within the 
Microsoft folder).
 
✦ Desktop: Click this folder to open workbook files you save directly on 
the desktop of your computer.
 
✦ My Documents: Click this button to open workbook files you save in the 
Personal folder inside the Windows folder. (In fact, on some computers, 
the My Documents button in the Excel 2010 Open dialog box appears as 
the Personal button.)
 
✦ My Computer: Click this button to open workbook files you save in fold-
ers on the local disks on your computer.
 
✦ My Network Places: Click this button to open workbook files you save in 
folders on the disks attached to your company’s network.

Keep in mind that you can select Preview on the Views button’s drop-down 
menu. Doing so displays a preview pane on the right side of the Open dialog 
box. This dialog box shows data in the upper-left corner of the first work-
sheet for all Excel 2010 workbooks saved with the Save Thumbnail check 
box selected and all Excel 97 through 2003 workbooks saved with the Save 
Preview Picture check box on the Summary tab of the workbook’s Properties 
dialog box selected. This preview of the first part of the initial worksheet can 
really help you quickly identify the workbook you want to open for editing or 
printing.
Opening more than one workbook at a time
If you know that you’re going to edit more than one of the workbook files’ 
sheets shown in the list box of the Open dialog box, you can select multiple 
files in the list box and Excel will then open all of them (in the order they’re 
listed) when you click the Open button or press Enter.
 
Remember that in order to select multiple files that appear sequentially in 
the Open dialog box, you click the first filename and then hold down the 
Shift key while you click the last filename. To select files that are not listed 
sequentially, you need to hold down the Ctrl key while you click the various 
filenames.
After the workbook files are open in Excel, you can then switch documents by 
selecting their filename buttons on the Windows taskbar or by using the Flip 
feature (Alt+Tab) to select the workbook’s thumbnail. (See Book II, Chapter 4 
for more information on working on more than one worksheet at a time.)
Opening recently edited workbooks 
under Windows 7
If you know that the workbook you now need to edit is one that you had 
opened recently, you don’t even have to fool around with the Open dialog 
box when running Excel under Windows 7. Just click File➪Recent to display 
the Recent Workbooks panel in the Excel Backstage View. This panel lists all 
the workbooks you’ve open recently in the order in which you opened them.
Excel 2010 automatically keeps a running list of the last 22 files you opened 
in the Recent Workbooks panel. If the workbook you want to work with is 
one of those shown on this list, you can open its file by clicking its filename 
in the list or by typing its number (1, 2, 3, and so on).
 
If you want, you can have Excel list more or fewer files in the Recent 
Documents list on the File pull-down menu. To change the number of 
recently opened files listed, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Click File➪Options➪Advanced or press Alt+FIA to open the Advanced 
tab of the Excel Options dialog box.

190
Opening a Workbook
 
2. Type a new entry (between 1 and 50) in the Show This Number of 
Recent Documents in Recent Documents combo box or use the spin-
ner buttons to increase or decrease this number.
 
3. Click OK or press Enter to close the Options dialog box.
 
Note that if you don’t want any files displayed in the Recent Workbooks 
panel in the Excel Backstage View, enter 0 in the Number of Documents in 
Recent Documents combo box or select it with the spinner buttons.
Finding misplaced workbooks
The only problem you can encounter in opening a document from the Open 
dialog box is locating the filename. Everything’s hunky-dory as long as you 
can see the workbook filename listed in the Open dialog box or know which 
folder to open in order to display it. But what about those times when a file 
seems to have mysteriously migrated and is now nowhere to be found on 
your computer?
Searching for workbooks when running Excel on Windows 7 or Vista
When you run Excel 2010 under Windows 7 or Vista, the operating system 
adds a Search Documents text box (simply called Search in Vista) to the 
Open dialog box (see Figure 3-2) that enables you to search for missing note-
books right from within the dialog box.
 
Figure 3-2:

The Search Documents text box
To use this search feature to find a workbook, click the Search Documents 
text box in the upper-right corner of the Open dialog box and then begin 
typing search characters used in the workbook’s filename or contained in 
the workbook itself.

As Windows finds any matches for the characters you type, the names of the 
workbook files (and other Excel files such as templates and macro sheets as 
well) appear in the Open dialog box. As soon as the workbook you want to 
open is listed, you can open it by clicking its icon and filename followed by 
the Open button or by double-clicking it.
Searching for workbooks when running Excel on Windows XP
Unfortunately, the Open dialog box in Excel 2010 when running the program 
under Windows XP does not have a search feature built into it. This means 
that to search for missing workbooks, you have to do it outside of Excel by 
using the Windows XP search feature.
To use the Windows search feature to find an Excel workbook, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Start button on the Windows XP taskbar and then click 
Search in the right column of the Search menu.
 
 Windows opens a Search Results dialog box.
 
2. Click the Documents (Word Processing, Spreadsheet, and so on) link 
in the left panel of the Search Results dialog box.
 
3. (Optional) If you know the last time the workbook file was modi-
fied, click the appropriate option button (Within the Last Week, Past 
Month, or Within the Past Year).
 
 If you haven’t the slightest idea the last time the workbook was edited, 
leave the Don’t Remember option button selected.
 
4. Click the All or Part of the Document Name text box and then type the 
filename or the part of the name that you’re sure of.
 
 Type an asterisk (*) for multiple missing characters and a question mark 
(?) for single missing characters that you can’t supply in the workbook 
filename, such as Budget*.xls?, for which Budget 1-2005.xlsx and Budget 
2-2005.xls are both matches.
 
5. (Optional) To search for the workbook on a particular hard drive or 
folder or by a phrase or name entered in the spreadsheets in the file, 
click the Use Advanced Search Options link and then enter contents to 
search for in the workbook in the A Word or Phrase in the Document 
text box.
 
 Change the location to search as well as any other of the advanced 
options that help narrow the search.
 
 Note that if you don’t know the workbook filename but you do know 
the size, a key phrase, or a name it contains, just enter the appropriate 
advanced search criteria, leaving the All or Part of the Document Name 
text box blank.

6. After you finish specifying all your search criteria, click the Search 
button to have Windows XP begin searching for the workbook file.
After you click Search, Windows displays all the workbook files that match 
your search criteria in the list box on the right side of the Search Results 
dialog box. When you locate the workbook file you want to edit in Excel, 
right-click its file icon and filename and then click Open on the shortcut 
menu or simply double-click it.
Using the other Open options
The drop-down menu attached to the Open button in the Open dialog box 
enables you to open the selected workbook file(s) in special ways. These 
ways include
 
✦ Open Read-Only: Opens the files you select in the Open dialog box’s list 
box in a read-only state, which means that you can look but you can’t 
touch. (Actually, you can touch; you just can’t save your changes.) To 
save changes in a read-only file, you must use File➪Save As command 
from the Excel menu bar and give the workbook file a new filename.
 
✦ Open as Copy: Opens a copy of the files you select in the Open dialog 
box. Use this method of file opening as a safety net: If you mess up the 
copies, you always have the originals to fall back on.
 
✦ Open in Browser: Opens workbook files you save as Web pages in your 
favorite Web browser (which would normally be Microsoft Internet 
Explorer). Note that this command is not available unless the program 
identifies that the selected file or files were saved as Web pages rather 
than plain old Excel worksheet files.
 
✦ Open in Protected View: Opens the selected workbook in Protected 
View that prevents you from making any editing changes to its work-
sheets until you click the Enable Editing button that appears in the red 
Protected View panel at the top of the worksheet area.
 
✦ Open and Repair: Attempts to repair corrupted workbook files before 
opening them in Excel. When you select this command, a dialog box 
appears giving you a choice between attempting to repair the corrupted 
file, or opening the recovered version, extracting the data out of the cor-
rupted file, and placing it in a new workbook (which you can save with 
the Save command). Click the Repair button to attempt to recover and 
open the file. Click the Extract Data button if you previously tried unsuc-
cessfully to have Excel repair the file.
 
✦ Show Previous Versions: Displays a list of various versions of the work-
book file automatically saved by Excel’s AutoRecover feature and given 
filenames that describe when the file and under what circumstances the 
version was saved.

Cell Editing 101
Cell Editing 101
The biggest thing to remember about basic cell editing is that you have to 
put the cell cursor in the cell whose contents you want to modify. When 
modifying a cell’s contents, you can replace the entry entirely, delete charac-
ters from the entry, and/or insert new characters into the entry:
 
✦ To replace a cell’s contents, position the cell cursor in the cell and just 
start inputting your new entry over it. (Remember you can do this by 
typing from the keyboard, speaking the new entry with the Dictation 
function of the Speech Recognition feature, or writing it by hand with 
the Handwriting Recognition feature.) The moment you start inputting 
the new entry, the first characters that are input entirely replace the 
existing data entry. To finish replacing the original entry, complete the 
new cell entry by using whatever technique you like (such as press-
ing an arrow key or Enter, or clicking the Enter button on the Formula 
bar). To abort the replacement and restore the original cell entry, click 
the Cancel button on the Formula bar or press the Escape key on your 
keyboard.
 
✦ To delete characters in a cell entry, click the insertion point in the entry 
on the Formula bar, press F2, or double-click the mouse pointer in the 
cell to get Excel into Edit mode (indicated by Edit on the Status bar). 
Then, use the Home, End, or ← and → keys to move the insertion point 
to a proper place in the entry and the Backspace and Delete keys to 
remove unnecessary or incorrect characters. (Backspace deletes char-
acters to the left of the insertion point, and Delete removes characters 
to the right of the insertion point.)
 
✦ To insert new characters in a cell entry, click the insertion point in the 
entry on the Formula bar, press F2, or double-click the mouse pointer in 
the cell to get Excel into Edit mode (indicated by Edit on the Status bar). 
Then, use the Home, End, or ← and → keys to move the insertion point 
to the place in the entry where the new characters are needed and start 
inputting the new characters. Excel automatically inserts the new char-
acters at the insertion point, thus pushing existing text to the right. If 
Excel replaces existing characters instead, you need to press the Insert 
key to get out of overtype mode (in which the new characters you input 
eat up the existing ones on the right) before you start inputting.
 
When you edit the contents of a cell by inserting and/or deleting characters 
in it, you need to remember to click the Enter button on the Formula bar or 
press the Enter key to complete the editing change and switch the program 
from Edit back to Ready mode (indicated by the reappearance of Ready on the 
Status bar). If you’re editing a cell with a simple text or number entry, you can 
also do this by clicking the mouse pointer in another cell to make it current 
(this doesn’t work, however, when you’re editing a formula because Excel just 
includes the address of the cell that you click as part of the edited formula). 

194
Cell Editing 101
Also, you can’t use any of the keystrokes that normally complete a new cell 
entry except for the Tab and Shift+Tab keystrokes for moving to the next and 
previous columns in the worksheet. (All the rest, including the arrow keys, 
Home, and End, just move the insertion point within the cell entry.)
Undo and Redo
Excel supports multiple levels of undo that you can use to recover from 
potentially costly editing mistakes that would require data re-entry or exten-
sive repair operations. The most important thing to remember about the 
Undo command is that it is cumulative, meaning that you don’t use it right 
away after making a boo-boo. In fact, you may have to select it multiple 
times to reverse several actions that you’ve taken before you get to the one 
that sets your spreadsheet right again.
You can select the Undo command either by clicking the Undo button on the 
Quick Access toolbar or by pressing Alt+Backspace or Ctrl+Z. Excel will then 
reverse the effect of the last edit you made in the worksheet. For example, 
if you edit a cell entry and erase some of its text in error, selecting Undo 
restores the characters that you just erased to the entry. Likewise, if you 
delete a group of cells by mistake, selecting Undo restores both their con-
tents and formatting to the worksheet.
On the Quick Access toolbar, you can click the drop-down button attached 
to the Undo command button to display a pop-up menu that shows a brief 
menu of the actions that you’ve recently taken in the spreadsheet. Instead of 
undoing one action at a time, you undo multiple actions by dragging through 
them in the pop-up menu. As soon as you release the mouse button, Excel 
then restores the spreadsheet to the state that it was in before you took all 
the actions that you selected on this pop-up menu.
When you make an editing change in a spreadsheet, the Undo item on the 
Undo button’s drop-down menu actually changes to reflect the action that 
you just took. For example, if you delete a group of cells by pressing the 
Delete key and then open the Undo button’s drop-down menu, the first item 
on the Undo menu appears as follows:
Clear
If you then apply new formatting to a cell selection, such as assigning a new 
center alignment, and then open the Undo drop-down menu, the first item on 
the Undo menu now appears as follows:
Center Alignment
 
The Undo feature works by storing a “snapshot” of the worksheet in the 
memory of your computer at each stage in its editing. Sometimes, if you 
attempt a large-scale edit in a worksheet, Excel will determine that sufficient 
free memory doesn’t exist to hold a snapshot of the worksheet in its current 

Book II
Chapter 3
Editing and Proofing 
Worksheets
195
Cell Editing 101
state and complete the planned editing change as well. For example, this can 
happen if you try to cut and paste a really large range in a big worksheet. 
In such a case, Excel displays an Alert dialog box that indicates a lack of 
enough memory and asks if you want to continue without Undo. If you then 
select the Yes option, Excel completes the planned edit but without the pos-
sibility of you being able to reverse its effects with Undo. Before you take 
such an action, consider how much time and effort would be required to 
manually restore the worksheet to its previous state if you make a mistake in 
carrying out your editing change.
After you use the Undo feature to reverse an editing change, the Redo button 
on the Quick Access toolbar becomes active. The Redo command item on 
the Redo button’s drop-down menu has the name of the latest type of editing 
that you just reversed with the Undo button, such as Redo Clear when the 
last action you took was to restore a cell entry that you just deleted.
You use the Redo command to restore the worksheet to the condition that it 
was in before you last selected the Undo command. As with using the Undo 
button on the Quick Access toolbar, when you click the drop-down button 
attached to the Redo button, you can drag through a series of actions that 
you want repeated (assuming that you used the Undo command multiple 
times). You can also restore edits that you’ve undone one at a time by press-
ing Ctrl+Y.
Editing in the cell versus on the Formula bar
When doing simple editing to a cell’s contents, 
the question arises as to whether it’s better 
to edit the contents in the cell directly or edit 
the contents on the Formula bar. When editing 
short entries that fit entirely within the current 
column width, it really is a matter of personal 
choice. Some people prefer editing on the 
Formula bar because it’s out of the way of 
other cells in the same region of the worksheet. 
Other people prefer editing on the Formula bar 
because they find it easier to click the insertion 
point with the I-beam mouse pointer at precisely 
the place in the entry that needs editing. (When 
you press F2 to edit in the cell, Excel always 
positions the insertion point at the very end of 
the entry, and when you double-click the thick 
white mouse pointer in the cell, you really can’t 
tell exactly where you’re putting the insertion 
point until you finish double-clicking, at which 
time you see the flashing insertion point.)
When it comes to editing longer cell entries 
(that is, text entries that spill over into empty 
neighboring cells, and numbers that, if their 
digits weren’t truncated by the number format 
assigned, wouldn’t fit within the current cell 
width), you probably will want to edit their 
contents on the Formula bar. You can click the 
Expand Formula bar button (the one with two 
greater than symbols turned downward on top 
of the other) to display the entire contents of 
the cell without obscuring any of the cells of 
the worksheet, or you can click the Next Row 
(the one with the triangle pointing down) and 
the Previous Row buttons (the one with the tri-
angle pointing up) to display the contents a row 
a time.

196
Cell Editing 101
 
You can use Undo and Redo to toggle between a Before and After view of 
your spreadsheet. For example, suppose that you update an entry in a cell 
that was used in formulas throughout a data table. As soon as you enter the 
new number in this cell, Excel recalculates the table and displays the new 
results. To once again view the original version of the table before you make 
this latest change, you use Undo (Ctrl+Z). After checking some values in the 
original table, you then restore the latest change to its numbers by selecting 
the Redo command (Ctrl+Y). You can then continue in this manner as long 
as you want, switching between Before and After versions by holding down 
the Ctrl key as you type Z and then type Y, alternating between Undo and 
then Redo.
Get that out of here!
Sometimes you need to delete an entry that you made in a cell of the spread-
sheet without replacing it with any other contents. Excel refers to this kind 
of deletion as clearing the cell. This is actually more correct than referring to 
it as “emptying” the cell because although the cell may appear empty when 
you delete its contents, it may still retain the formatting assigned to it, and 
therefore not truly be empty.
For this reason, clicking the Clear button (the one with the eraser icon) 
in the Editing group on the far right of the Home tab (or pressing Alt+HE) 
opens a drop-down menu with these options:
 
✦ Clear All: Use this to get rid of both the contents and the formatting 
assigned to the current cell selection.
 
✦ Clear Formats: Use this to get rid of just the formatting assigned to the 
current cell selection without getting rid of the contents.
 
✦ Clear Contents: Use this to get rid of just the contents in the current cell 
selection without getting rid of the formatting assigned to it (this is the 
equivalent of pressing the Delete key).
 
✦ Clear Comments: Use this to get rid of just the comments assigned to 
the cells in the selection without touching either the contents or the 
formatting.
 
✦ Clear Hyperlinks: Use this to remove hyperlinks from the cells in the 
selection without also removing their formatting.
 
✦ Remove Hyperlinks: Use this to remove both the hyperlinks and their 
formatting from the cells in the selection.
The Clear All option is great when you need to truly empty a cell of all for-
matting and contents while at the same time retaining that empty cell in 
the worksheet. However, what about when you need to get rid of the cell as 
well as all its contents? For example, suppose that you entered a column of 
numbers that you’ve totaled with a summing formula only to discover that 
midway in the list, you entered the same number twice, in one cell above 

Book II

Worksheets

the other. You don’t want to just delete the duplicate number in one of the 
two cells, thus leaving a single empty cell in the middle of your list of values. 
Having an empty cell in the middle of the list won’t skew the total, but it 
won’t look professional!
In this case, you want to delete both the duplicate entry and remove the newly 
emptied cell while at the same time pulling up the cells with the rest of the 
numbers in the list below along with the cell at the end that contains the for-
mula that sums the values together. Excel offers just such a command on the 
Home tab in the form of the Delete button and its drop-down menu. When you 
click Delete Cells on the Delete button’s drop-down menu (or press Alt+HDD), 
a Delete dialog box appears, similar to the one shown in Figure 3-3. This dialog 
box lets you choose how you want the remaining cells to be shifted when the 
selected cell (or cells) is removed from the worksheet.
 
Keep in mind that when you use the Delete Cells option, Excel zaps every-
thing, including the contents, formatting, and any and all attached com-
ments. Don’t forget about the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or 
Ctrl+Z in case you ever zap something you shouldn’t have!
Figures 3-3 and 3-4 illustrate how Delete works in the example where a 
duplicate entry has been mistakenly entered in a column of numbers that 
is totaled by a summing formula. In Figure 3-3, I selected cells A5:B5, which 
contain duplicate entries, before clicking the Delete button’s drop-down 
button and then clicking Delete Cells on its drop-down menu to display the 
Delete dialog box.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Deleting a 
cell with a 
duplicate 
entry.
 
As this figure shows, when the Delete dialog box opens, the Shift Cells Up 
option button is automatically selected. Figure 3-4 shows the same work-
sheet after clicking the OK button in the Delete dialog box. Notice how Excel 

198
Cell Editing 101
pulled up the entries in the cells below when it deleted the duplicate in cell 
B5, while at the same time automatically recalculating the summing formula 
to reflect the total of the remaining entries.
 
Figure 3-4: 
Worksheet 
after 
deleting the 
cell with the 
duplicate 
entry.
 
 
Don’t confuse the use of the Delete key and the Delete Cells command. When 
you press the Delete key, Excel automatically deletes just the contents of the 
cells that are selected (keeping whatever formatting is used intact), leaving 
seemingly blank cells in the worksheet. When you choose Delete Cells on 
the Delete button’s drop-down menu, Excel displays the Delete dialog box, 
which deletes the selected cells and then shifts the remaining cells in the 
direction that you designate (up or to the left) to fill in what would otherwise 
be blank cells.
 
If you know that you want to use the Shift Cells Up option when deleting the 
current cell selection, you don’t have to bother with opening the Delete dialog 
box at all: Simply click the Delete button (rather than its drop-down button) 
and Excel instantly deletes the selection and pulls all remaining cells up.
Can I just squeeze this in here?
The Insert command button in the Editing group of the Ribbon’s Home tab 
is set very much like the Delete button immediately below it. You click the 
Insert button’s drop-down button and then its Insert Cells option (or press 
Alt+HII) to open an Insert dialog box where you indicate how Excel is to deal 
with existing cell entries in order to accommodate the blank cells you need 
to squeeze in.

For example, suppose that you discover that you’ve left out three numbers 
from a column of summed numbers and that these values should have 
appeared in the middle of the column. To make this edit, position the cell 
cursor in the first cell of those cells whose values need to be shifted down to 
make room for the three missing entries and then drag the cell cursor down 
two rows so that you have selected the three cells with entries that you want 
to retain but also need to have moved down.
Figures 3-5 and 3-6 illustrate this situation. In Figure 3-5, I selected the cell 
range A5:B7, where cells for the six missing entries are to be inserted. I then 
clicked the drop-down button on the Insert button followed by Insert Cells 
on its drop-down menu. This action opened the Insert dialog box with the 
Shift Cells Down option button selected. Because I needed to have the cells 
in the selected range moved down to make room for the missing entries, I 
then simply clicked OK.

B8, respectively
 
✦ 2000 David Court and $450,000 previously in cells A6 and B6 to A9 and

This leaves the cell range previously occupied range A5:B7 with six blank 
cells where I can enter the following values:
 
✦ 34 6th Avenue and $125,000 in new blank cells A5 and A6, respectively
 
✦ 347 Oak Road and $350,000 in new blank cells A6 and B6, respectively
 
✦ 25 Smith Ranch and $285,000 in new blank cells A7 and B8, respectively
As you can see, the sum formula in the last cell in this column (now shifted 
down from cell B8 to cell B11) has automatically been recalculated so that 
the total reflects the addition of the missing values that I entered in the 
newly inserted cells.
 
If you know that you want to move existing cells down with the Shift Cells 
Down option when inserting new cells in the current cell selection, you 
don’t have to bother with opening the Insert dialog box at all: Simply click 
the Insert button (rather than its drop-down button) and Excel will instantly 
insert new cells while moving the existing ones down.

The biggest problem with editing is finding and getting to the place in the 
worksheet that needs modification and then keeping your place in the work-
sheet as you make the changes. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that 
you probably often work with really large spreadsheets, only a small portion 
of which can be displayed at any one time on your screen.

Book II

A Spreadsheet with a View
Excel provides a number of features that can help you find your way and 
keep your place in the spreadsheet that needs editing. Among these are its 
Zoom feature, which enables you to increase or decrease the magnification 
of the worksheet window, thus making it possible to switch from a really up-
close view to a really far-away view in seconds, and its Freeze Panes feature, 
which enables you to keep pertinent information, such as column and row 
headings, on the worksheet window as you scroll other columns and rows of 
data into view.
“Zoom, zoom, zoom”
Excel 2010 makes it really easy to see more data in the active worksheet 
window with its Zoom slider feature on the Status bar in the lower-right 
corner of the window. The Zoom slider contains two buttons on either end: a 
Zoom Out button on the left side that reduces the Worksheet area’s magnifi-
cation percentage by 10 percent each time you click it and a Zoom In button 
on the right side that increases the Worksheet area’s magnification percent-
age by 10 percent each time you click it. You can also quickly change the 
Worksheet area’s magnification percentage (and thus zoom out and in on 
the data) by dragging the slider’s button to the left or right.
 
Note that the Zoom slider button is always located in the very center of the 
Zoom slider, putting the Worksheet area magnification at 100% (the normal 
screen, depending upon your computer monitor’s screen resolution) when 
you first open the worksheet. As you click the Zoom Out or Zoom In button 
or drag the slider button, Excel keeps you informed of the current magni-
fication percentage by displaying it to the immediate left of the Zoom Out 
button on the Status bar. Note too, that 10% is the lowest percentage you 
can select by dragging the button all the way to the left on the slider, and 
400% is the highest percentage you can select by dragging the button all the 
way to the right.
Although the Zoom slider is always available on the Status bar in any work-
sheet you have open, you can change the Worksheet area’s magnification 
percentage by clicking the Zoom button on the Ribbon’s View tab or by 
pressing Alt+WO. Doing this opens the Zoom dialog box, where you can 
select preset magnification percentages 200%, 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% by 
clicking its option button before you click OK. In addition, you enter any 
magnification percentage between a minimum of 10% and a maximum of 
400% by clicking its Custom options button and entering the percentage in 
its text box before you click OK.
You can also have Excel change the magnification to suit the cell range 
that you’ve selected. To do this, select your cell range, click the Zoom to 
Selection button on the View tab, or press Alt+WY1. Note that you can also 
do this same thing by clicking the Fit Selection option button when the Zoom 
dialog box is open before you click OK.

If you own a version of Microsoft’s IntelliMouse (that is, a mouse with a 
wheel in between the two mouse buttons), you can set it up in Excel so that 
rolling the wheel back and forth zooms out and in on the current worksheet. 
To do this, click the Zoom on Roll with IntelliMouse check box in the Editing 
Options section of the Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog box 
(File➪Options➪Advanced or Alt+FIA). After you select this check box, 
instead of scrolling up the rows of the worksheet, rolling the wheel forward 
increases the magnification (by 15% until you reach the maximum 400%). 
Instead of scrolling down the rows of the sheet, rolling the wheel backward 
decreases the magnification (by 15% until you reach the minimum 10% 
value).
Figures 3-7 and 3-8 illustrate how you can use the Zoom feature to first zoom 
out to locate a region in a large spreadsheet that needs editing and then 
zoom in on the region to do the editing. In Figure 3-7, I zoomed out on the 
Income Analysis to display all its data by selecting a 48% magnification set-
ting. (I actually did this by dragging the Zoom slider button to the left until 
48% appeared on the Status bar to the left of the Zoom Out button.) At the 
48% setting, I could just barely make out the headings and read the numbers 
in the cells. I then located the cells that needed editing and selected their 
cell range (J20:L25) in the worksheet.

After selecting the range of cells to be edited, I then clicked the Zoom to 
Selection button on the View tab. You can see the result in Figure 3-8. As you 
can see on the Status bar, Excel boosted the magnification from 48% up to 
230% the moment I clicked the Zoom to Selection button: a comfortable size 
for editing these cells on even one of the smaller computer monitors.
 
Figure 3-8:

Because Excel immediately puts the slider button at whatever point you 
click, you can instantly return the magnification percentage to the normal 
100% after selecting any other magnification. Simply click the line at the mid-
point in the Zoom slider on the Status bar.
Freezing window panes
Figure 3-8 could be the poster-boy for the Freeze Panes feature. Although 
zooming in on the range of cells that needs editing has made their data entries 
easy to read, it has also removed all the column and row headings that give 
you any clue as to what kind of data you’re looking at. If I had used the Freeze 
Panes command to freeze column A with the row headings and row 2 with the 
column headings, they would remain displayed on the screen — regardless of 
the magnification settings you select or how you scroll through the cells.

204
A Spreadsheet with a View
To use the Freeze Panes feature in this manner, you first position the cell 
cursor in the cell that’s located to the immediate left of the column or col-
umns that you want to freeze and immediately beneath the row or rows that 
you want to freeze before you click the Freeze Panes button on the Ribbon’s 
View tab followed by Freeze Panes on the button’s drop-down menu (you 
can also do this by pressing Alt+WF and pressing the Enter key to select the 
Freeze Pane option on the drop-down menu).
 
To freeze the top row of the worksheet (assuming that it contains column 
headings) from anywhere in the worksheet (it doesn’t matter where the cell 
cursor is), click the Freeze Top Row option on the Freeze Panes button’s 
drop-down menu. If you want to freeze the first column (assuming that it 
contains row headings) from anywhere in the worksheet, click the Freeze 
First Column option on the Freeze Panes button’s drop-down menu instead.
Figures 3-9 and 3-10 illustrate how this works. Figure 3-9 shows the Income 
Analysis spreadsheet after freezing column A and rows 1 and 2. To do this, 
I positioned the cell cursor in cell B3 before clicking Freeze Panes on the 
Freeze Panes button’s drop-down menu. Notice the thin black line that runs 
down column A and across row 2, marking which column and rows of the 
worksheet are frozen on the display and that will now remain in view — 
regardless of how far you scroll to the right to new columns or scroll down 
to new rows.

As Figure 3-10 shows, frozen panes stay on the screen even when you zoom 
in and out on the worksheet. For Figure 3-10, I repeated the steps I took in 
changing the magnification for Figures 3-7 and 3-8 (only this time with the 
frozen panes in place). First, I zoomed out on the Income Analysis spread-
sheet by dialing the 48% magnification setting on the Zoom slider; second, I 
selected the range J20:L25 and then clicked the Zoom to Selection button on 
the View tab.
Figure 3-10 shows the result. Note that with the frozen panes in place, this 
time Excel only selected a 172% magnification setting instead of the original 
230% setting. This lower magnification setting is worth it because of all the 
important information that has been added to the cell range.
 
When you press the Ctrl+Home shortcut key after you’ve frozen panes in a 
worksheet, instead of positioning the cell cursor in cell A1 as normal, Excel 
positions the cell cursor in the first unfrozen cell. In the example illustrated 
in Figure 3-9, pressing Ctrl+Home from anywhere in the worksheet puts the 
cell cursor in B3. From there, you can position the cell cursor in A1 either by 
clicking the cell or by pressing the arrow keys.
To unfreeze the panes after you’ve finished editing, click the Unfreeze Panes 
option on the Freeze Panes button’s drop-down menu (this option replaces 
Freeze Panes at the top of the menu).

Frozen Panes in the worksheet display have a parallel feature when printing 
a spreadsheet called Print Titles. When you use Print Titles in a report, the 
columns and rows that you define as the titles are printed at the top and to 
the left of all data on each page of the report (see Book II, Chapter 5 for 
details).
Saving custom views
In the course of creating and editing a worksheet, you may find that you 
need to modify the worksheet display many times as you work with the 
document. For example, you may find at some point that you need to reduce 
the magnification of the worksheet display to 75% magnification. At another 
point, you may need to return to 100% magnification and hide different col-
umns in the worksheet. At some later point, you may have to redisplay the 
hidden columns and then freeze panes in the worksheet.
Excel’s Custom Views feature enables you to save any of these types of 
changes to the worksheet display. This way, instead of taking the time to 
manually set up the worksheet display that you want, you can have Excel 
re-create it for you simply by selecting the view. When you create a view, 
Excel can save any of the following settings: the current cell selection, print 
settings (including different page setups), column widths and row heights 
(including hidden columns), display settings on the Advanced tab of the 
Excel Options dialog box, as well as the current position and size of the doc-
ument window and the window pane arrangement (including frozen panes).
To create a custom view of your worksheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Make all the necessary changes to the worksheet display so that the 
worksheet window appears exactly as you want it to appear each 
time you select the view. Also select all the print settings on the 
Page Layout tab that you want used in printing the view (see Book II, 
Chapter 5 for details).
 
2. Click the Custom Views command button on the View tab or press 
Alt+WCV.
 
 This action opens the Custom Views dialog box, shown in Figure 3-11, 
where you add the view that you’ve just set up in the worksheet.
 
3. Click the Add button.
 
 This action opens the Add View dialog box, where you type a name for 
your new view.
 
4. Enter a unique descriptive name for your view in the Name text box.
 
 Make sure that the name you give the view reflects all its pertinent 
settings.

the workbook with the new view.
 
7. Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+S to 
save the new view as part of the workbook file.
After you create your views, you can display the worksheet in that view at 
any time while working with the spreadsheet. To display a view, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Custom Views command button on the View tab or press 
Alt+WCV.
 
2. Double-click the name of the view that you want to use in displaying 
your worksheet in the Views list box or click the name and then click 
the Show button.
 
Always start by defining a Normal 100% view in the Custom Views dialog 
box that represents the standard view of the worksheet before you go about 
defining custom views that hide columns, freeze panes, and mess with the 
worksheet’s magnification. This way, you can recover from a special view 
(especially one that you only use in printing part of the spreadsheet but 
never use when editing it) simply by double-clicking Normal 100% in the 
Views list box of the Custom Views dialog box.

Copying and Moving Stuff Around
Copying and Moving Stuff Around
Moving and copying worksheet data are among the most common editing 
tasks that you perform when editing a typical spreadsheet. Excel offers two 
basic methods for moving and copying a cell selection in a worksheet: First, 
you can use drag-and-drop to drag the cells to a new location, or second, 
you can cut or copy the contents to the Clipboard and then paste them into 
the desired area. Moving and copying data to new areas in a spreadsheet are 
basically very straightforward procedures. You need to keep a few things in 
mind, however, when rearranging cell entries in a worksheet:
 
✦ When you move or copy a cell, Excel moves everything in the cell, 
including the contents, formatting, and any comment assigned to the 
cell (see Book IV, Chapter 3, for information on adding comments to 
cells).
 
✦ If you move or copy a cell so that it overlays an existing entry, Excel 
replaces the existing entry with the contents and formatting of the cell 
that you’re moving or copying. This means that you can replace exist-
ing data in a range without having to clear the range before moving or 
copying the replacement entries. It also means that you must be careful 
not to overlay any part of an existing range that you don’t want replaced 
with the relocated or copied cell entries.
 
✦ When you move cells referred to in formulas in a worksheet, Excel auto-
matically adjusts the cell references in the formulas to reflect their new 
locations in the worksheet.
 
✦ When you copy formulas that contain cell references, Excel automati-
cally adjusts the cell references in the copies relative to the change in 
their position in the worksheet (see Book III, Chapter 1, for details on 
copying formulas in a spreadsheet).
 
For situations in which you only need to copy a single data entry to cells in a 
single row or to cells in a single column of the worksheet, keep in mind that 
you can use AutoFill to extend the selection left or right or up or down by 
dragging the Fill handle (see Book II, Chapter 1, for information about using 
AutoFill to extend and copy a cell entry).
Doing it with drag-and-drop
Drag-and-drop provides the newest and quickest way to move or copy a 
range of cells in a single worksheet. To move a range, simply select the cells, 
position the pointer on any one of the edges of the range, and then drag the 
range to its new position in the worksheet and release the mouse button.
 
Note that you can’t use drag-and-drop to copy or move a cell selection 
unless the first cell of the range into which the cells are being copied or 
moved is visible in the Excel work area. This means that you can’t use drag-
and-drop to copy or move cells between different worksheets in the same 

Book II

Editing and Proofing 
Worksheets
209
Copying and Moving Stuff Around
workbook or between different workbook files unless you first set up win-
dows in the Excel work area that display both the cells that you’re moving or 
copying and the cells into which they’re being moved or copied. (See Book 
II, Chapter 4, for information on setting up windows that enable this.) Use 
the cut-and-paste method (as described in the following section) to move 
and copy cell selections beyond the current worksheet when you don’t have 
such windows set up.
Moving cells with drag-and-drop
The only thing that you need to be mindful of when using drag-and-drop is 
that you must position the pointer on one of the edges of the cell range and 
wait until the pointer changes shape from a thick white cross to an outlined 
arrowhead pointing to the center of a black cross, before you begin dragging 
the range to its new position in the worksheet. Also, when positioning the 
pointer on an edge of the range, avoid the lower-right corner because locat-
ing the pointer there transforms it into the Fill handle (a simple black cross) 
used by the AutoFill feature to extend the cell range rather than move the 
range.
As you drag a cell range using drag-and-drop, Excel displays only the out-
line of the range with a ScreenTip that keeps you informed of its new cell or 
range address. After you’ve positioned the outline of the range so that it sur-
rounds the appropriate cells in a new area of the worksheet, simply release 
the mouse button. Excel moves the selected cells (including the entries, for-
matting, and comments) to this area.
If the outline of the cell selection that you’re dropping encloses any cells 
with existing data entries, Excel displays an Alert dialog box asking whether 
you want to replace the contents of the destination cells. If you click OK 
in this dialog box, the overlaid data entries are completely zapped when 
they’re replaced by the incoming entries.
Copying cells with drag-and-drop
You can use drag-and-drop to copy cell ranges as well as to move them. To 
modify drag-and-drop so that the feature copies the selected cells rather 
than relocating them, hold down the Ctrl key when you position the pointer 
on one of the edges of the selected range (remember to avoid that lower-
right corner!). Excel indicates that drag-and-drop is ready to copy rather 
than move the cell selection by changing the mouse pointer to an outline 
pointer with a small plus sign in the upper-right. When the pointer assumes 
this shape, you simply drag the outline of the selected cell range to the 
desired position and release both the Ctrl key and mouse button.
Carried away with cut-and-paste
Given the convenience of using drag-and-drop, you may still prefer to use 
the more traditional cut-and-paste method when moving or copying cells in 

210
Copying and Moving Stuff Around
a worksheet. Cut-and-paste uses the Clipboard (a special area of memory 
shared by all Windows programs), which provides a temporary storage area 
for the data in your cell selection until you paste the selection into its new 
position in the worksheet.
To move a cell selection, click the Cut command button (the one with the 
scissors icon) in the Clipboard group at the beginning of the Ribbon’s Home 
tab (or press the shortcuts, Alt+HX, Ctrl+X, or Shift+Delete). To copy the 
selection, click the Copy command button (with the two sheets of paper side 
by side immediately beneath the Cut button) on the Home tab (or press the 
shortcuts, Alt+HC, Ctrl+C, or Ctrl+Insert).
When you cut or copy a selection to the Clipboard, Excel displays a marquee 
around the cell selection (sometimes called marching ants), and the follow-
ing message appears on the Status bar:
Select destination and press ENTER or choose Paste
To complete the move or copy operation, simply select the first cell in the 
range where you want the relocated or copied selection to appear and then 
press the Enter key, click the Paste button on the Home tab, or press the 
shortcuts Alt+HV, Ctrl+V, or Shift+Insert. Excel then completes the move 
or copy operation, pasting the range as required, starting with the active 
cell. When selecting the first cell of a paste range, be sure that you have suf-
ficient blank cells below and to the right of the active cell so that the range 
you’re pasting doesn’t overlay any existing data that you don’t want Excel to 
replace.
 
Unlike when moving and copying a cell selection with drag-and-drop, the 
cut-and-paste method doesn’t warn you when it’s about to replace existing 
cell entries in cells that are overlaid by the incoming cell range — it just 
goes ahead and replaces them with nary a beep or an alert! If you find that 
you moved the selection to the wrong area or replaced cells in error, imme-
diately click the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z to 
restore the range to its previous position in the worksheet.
“Paste it again, Sam”
When you complete a copy operation with cut-and-paste by clicking the 
Paste button in the Clipboard group at the beginning of the Ribbon’s Home 
tab instead of pressing the Enter key, Excel copies the selected cell range 
to the paste area in the worksheet without removing the marquee from the 
original range. You can continue to paste the selection to other areas in the 
worksheet without having to open the Clipboard Task pane to recopy the 
cell range to the Clipboard. If you don’t need to paste the cell range in any 
other place in the worksheet, you can press Enter to complete the copy 
operation. If you don’t need to make further copies after using the Paste 
command, you can remove the marquee from the original selection simply 
by pressing the Escape or the Enter key.

Also, when you paste a cell selection that you’ve copied to the Clipboard 
(this doesn’t apply when pasting cells that you’ve cut to the Clipboard), 
Excel displays the Paste Options button in the lower-right corner of the cell 
selection (marked with the word Ctrl). When you position the mouse pointer 
over this Paste Options button (or press the Ctrl key), a palette of buttons 
divided into three sections (Paste, Paste Values, and Other Paste Options) 
appears as shown in Figure 3-12.

The buttons in these three sections of the Paste Options palette offer you 
the following choices for refining your paste operation:
 
✦ Paste (P): Excel pastes everything in the cell selection (text, values, for-
mulas, and cell formatting).
 
✦ Formulas (F): Excel pastes all the text, numbers, and formulas in the cur-
rent cell selection without their formatting.
 
✦ Formulas & Number Formatting (O): Excel pastes the number formats 
assigned to the copied values along with their formulas.
 
✦ Keep Source Formatting (K): Excel copies the formatting from the origi-
nal cells and pastes this into the destination cells (along with the copied 
entries).
 
✦ No Borders (B): Excel pastes everything in the cell selection without 
copying any borders applied to its cell range.
 
✦ Keep Source Column Widths (W): Excel makes the width of the columns 
in the destination range the same as those in the source range when it 
copies their cell entries.

212
Copying and Moving Stuff Around
 
✦ Transpose (T): Excel changes the orientation of the pasted entries. For 
example, if the original cell entries run down the rows of a single column 
of the worksheet, the transposed pasted entries will run across the col-
umns of a single row.
 
✦ Values (V): Excel pastes only the calculated results of any formulas in 
the source cell range.
 
✦ Values & Number Formatting (A): Excel pastes the calculated results of 
any formulas along with all the formatting assigned to the labels, values, 
and formulas in the source cell range into the destination range. This 
means that all the labels and values in the destination range appear for-
matted just like the source range even though all the original formulas 
are lost and only the calculated values are retained.
 
✦ Values & Source Formatting (E): Excel pastes the calculated results of 
all formulas along with formatting assigned to source cell range.
 
✦ Formatting (R): Excel pastes only the formatting (and not the entries) 
copied from the source cell range to the destination range.
 
✦ Paste Link (N): Excel creates linking formulas in the destination range 
so that any changes that you make to the entries in cells in the source 
range are immediately brought forward and reflected in the correspond-
ing cells of the destination range. 
When you’re dealing with a selection that contains graphic objects along 
with numbers and/or text, Excel adds two additional items to the Options 
pop-up menu:
 
✦ Picture (U): Excel pastes only the pictures in the copied cell selection.
 
✦ Linked Picture (I): Excel pastes a link to the pictures in the copied cell 
selection.
Taking it out of the Clipboard Task pane
Excel puts the contents of all cell selections that you copy and paste (using 
the Copy and Paste command buttons or their keyboard equivalents) into 
the Office Clipboard. In fact, as you edit your spreadsheet in this manner, the 
Clipboard stores the contents of up to the last 24 copied-and-pasted cell selec-
tions (before replacing them with new copied-and-pasted selections). Up to 
that time, you can examine the contents of the Clipboard and even paste your 
cell selections in other places in your spreadsheet or in documents open in 
other programs that you’re running (see Book IV, Chapter 4 for information 
about pasting Excel data from the Clipboard into other applications).
To open the Clipboard Task pane on the left side of the Excel program 
window, click the Dialog Box Launcher in the Clipboard group on the Ribbon’s 
Home tab (the button in the lower-right corner of the Clipboard group with an 
arrow pointing downward at a diagonal forty-five degree angle).

Copying and Moving Stuff Around
When the Clipboard Task pane is displayed, it shows all the individual cop-
ied-and-pasted items that have been placed there (up to a maximum of 24). 
While this pane is open, Excel also places there all selections that you cut or 
copy in the worksheet, even those that you paste by pressing the Enter key 
as well as those you don’t paste elsewhere.
 
If you want Excel to place all selections that you cut and copy in the work-
sheet into the Office Clipboard even when the Clipboard task pane is not 
open, click the Collect Without Showing the Office Clipboard item on the 
Options button’s drop-down menu at the bottom of the Clipboard pane.
To paste an item on the Clipboard into a cell of one of your worksheets, click 
the cell, and then position the mouse pointer over the item in the Clipboard 
Task pane. When the item’s pop-up button appears, click this button and 
then click Paste on the pop-up menu, shown in Figure 3-13.

If you’re doing a lot of cut-and-paste work in a spreadsheet using the 
Clipboard, you can have Excel automatically display the Clipboard Task 
pane as you do the editing. Simply open the Clipboard Task pane, click the 
Options button at the very bottom, and then click the Show Office Clipboard 
Automatically option on its pop-up menu to select this setting. When this 
setting is selected, Excel automatically opens the Clipboard Task pane if you 

214
Copying and Moving Stuff Around
put more than two items in the Clipboard during your work session. To have 
Excel display the Clipboard Task pane when you press Ctrl+C twice in a row 
(Ctrl+CC), click the Show Clipboard When Ctrl+C Pressed Twice option on 
this menu.
Inserting rather than replacing copied cells
When you use cut-and-paste to move or copy a cell selection, you can have 
Excel paste the data into the worksheet without replacing existing entries 
in overlaid cells by clicking the Insert Cut Cells or Insert Copied Cells on the 
Insert button’s drop-down menu (depending on whether you cut or copied 
the cells to the Clipboard) on the Ribbon’s Home tab instead of clicking the 
normal Paste command button. Excel then displays the Insert Paste dialog 
box, where you can choose between a Shift Cells Right or a Shift Cells Down 
option button. Select Shift Cells Right to have existing cells moved to columns 
on the right to make room for the moved or copied cells. Select Shift Cells 
Down to have the existing cells moved to lower rows to make room for them.
 
If you want to shift existing cells down to make room for the ones you’ve 
cut or copied to the Clipboard, you can simply click the Insert button on the 
Home tab rather than bothering to click the Insert Cut Cells or Insert Copied 
Cells option on the button’s drop-down menu.
Pasting just the good parts with Paste Special
Normally, when you paste worksheet data from the Clipboard, Excel pastes 
all the information (entries, formatting, and comments) from the cell selec-
tion into the designated paste area, thus replacing any existing entries in 
the cells that are overlaid. You can, however, use the options on the Paste 
button’s drop-down menu or use the options in the Paste Special dialog box 
(by clicking Paste Special on this drop-down menu or pressing Alt+HVS) to 
control what information is pasted into the paste range. 
If you open the Paste Special dialog box (see Figure 3-14), you also have 
access to options that perform simple mathematical computations (Add, 
Subtract, Multiply, and Divide) between the number of cell entries that over-
lay each other. (See Table 3-1.)
The options in the Paste Special dialog box are divided into two areas: 
Paste and Operation. The Paste option buttons (some of which duplicate 
the options on the drop-down menu on the Ribbon and the Paste Option’s 
palette in the worksheet) enable you to specify which components of the 
copied cell selection you want copied; see Table 3-1 for a list of options.
The Operation option buttons in the Paste Special dialog box enable you to 
specify which mathematical operation, if any, should be performed between 
the overlaying values in copy and paste ranges. Select the Skip Blanks check 
box when you don’t want Excel to replace existing entries in the paste range 
with overlaying blank cells in the copy range.

The Transpose option on the Paste button’s drop-down menu and the Paste 
Options button (as well as duplicated by the Transpose check box in the 
Paste Special dialog box) is particularly helpful when you have a row of 
column headings that you want to convert into a column of row headings 

Book II

Editing and Proofing 
Worksheets

or when you have a column of row headings that you want to convert into 
a row of column headings. You can also use this option to pivot an entire 
table of data so that the data that runs across the rows now runs down the 
columns and vice versa.
Figure 3-15 illustrates just such a situation. Here, I selected the produc-
tion schedule table (including the column headings) in the cell range A3:J8, 
clicked the Copy button on the Home tab of the Ribbon, and then moved the 
cell cursor to cell A10. After that, I clicked the Transpose option on the Paste 
button’s drop-down menu. The results of this transposition appear in the 
cell range A10:F19 in Figure 3-15.
In the transposed table, the original row headings are now the column head-
ings just as the original column headings are now the row headings. Note, 
too, that in transposing the table, Excel retained the formulas that total the 
units produced each month, although now they appear in the last column of 
the table instead of the last row.
 
To convert a cell range that contains formulas to its calculated values (as 
though you had input them as numbers), select the cell range, click the Copy 
button on the Home tab, and then click the Paste Values option on the Paste 
button’s drop-down menu without moving the cell cursor. This causes Excel to 
paste the calculated values on top of the formulas that created them, thus zap-
ping the overlaid formulas and leaving you with only the computed values!

Find and Replace This Disgrace!
No discussion of spreadsheet editing would be complete without includ-
ing the Find and Replace features in Excel. You can use the Find feature to 
quickly locate each and every occurrence of a specific string (a series of 
characters) in a worksheet. You can use the Replace feature to have Excel 
actually update the cells that it finds with new text or numbers.
Both the Find and the Replace features share the same dialog box (aptly called 
the Find and Replace dialog box). If you only want to find a cell’s particular 
contents, you just use the options on the Find tab. (The Find tab is automati-
cally selected when you open the Find and Replace dialog box by clicking the 
Find option on the Find & Select button’s drop-down menu on the Home tab 
of the Ribbon, or when you press Alt+HFDF or simply Ctrl+F.) If you want to 
update the contents of some or all of the cells that you find, use the options 
on the Replace tab (which is automatically selected when you open the Find 
and Replace dialog box by clicking the Replace option on the Find & Select 
button’s drop-down menu, or when you press Alt+HFDR or simply Ctrl+H).
The Find and Replace tabs in the Find and Replace dialog box contain a 
bunch of search options that you can use in finding and replacing stuff 
in your spreadsheet. The only problem is that these options are hidden 
when you first open the Find and Replace dialog box. To expand the Find 
and Replace dialog box to display the extra search options on the Find and 
Replace tab, click the Options button.
Finding stuff
To use the Find command to locate information in your worksheet, follow 
these steps:
 
1. To search the entire worksheet, select a single cell. To restrict the 
search to a specific cell range or nonadjacent selection, select all the 
cells to be searched.
 
2. Click the Find option on the Find & Select button’s drop-down menu 
on the Ribbon’s Home tab or press Ctrl+F.
 
 Excel opens the Find and Replace dialog box with the Find tab selected.
 
3. Type the search string that you want to locate in the Find What combo 
box.
 
 When entering the search string, you can use the question mark (?) or 
asterisk (*) wildcards to stand in for any characters that you’re unsure 
of. Use the question mark to stand for a single character, as in Sm?th, 
which will match either Smith or Smyth. Use the asterisk to stand for 
multiple characters as in 9*1, which will locate 91, 94901, or even 9553 
1st Street. To search with the asterisk as a wildcard character, precede 

Book II
Chapter 3
Editing and Proofing 
Worksheets
219
Find and Replace This Disgrace!
the character with a tilde (~), as in ~*2.5, to locate formulas that are 
multiplied by the number 2.5 (the asterisk is the multiplication operator 
in Excel).
 
 If the cell holding the search string that you’re looking for is formatted 
in a particular way, you can narrow the search by specifying what for-
matting to search for.
 
4. Click the Options button and then click the Format drop-down button 
to specify the formatting to search for in addition to your search 
string. Click the Format item to select the formatting from the Find 
Format dialog box or click Choose Format from Cell to select the for-
matting directly from a cell in the worksheet.
 
 When you click the Format item, Excel opens a Find Format dialog box 
with the same tabs and options as the standard Format Cells dialog box. 
You then select the formatting that you want to search for in this dialog 
box and click OK.
 
 When you click the Choose Format from Cell item on the Format button 
pop-up menu, the Find and Replace dialog box temporarily disappears 
until you click the cell in the worksheet that contains the formatting that 
you want to search for with the thick, white-cross mouse pointer with 
eyedropper icon.
 
 Note that when using the Find feature to locate a search string, by 
default, Excel searches only the current worksheet for your search 
string. If you want Excel to search all the cells of all worksheets in the 
workbook, you need to follow Step 5.
 
5. Click the Workbook option on the Within drop-down menu to have 
Excel search all worksheets in the workbook.
 
 If the Within drop-down list box doesn’t appear at the bottom of your 
Find and Replace dialog box, click the Options button to expand it and 
add the Within, Search, and Look In drop-down list boxes along with the 
Match Case and Match Entire Cell Contents check boxes.
 
 By default, Excel searches across the rows in the worksheet or current 
selection (that is, to the right and then down from the active cell). If you 
want to have the program search down the columns and then across the 
rows, you need to follow Step 6.
 
6. Click the By Columns option on the Search drop-down menu to have 
Excel search down the columns (that is, down and then to the right 
from the active cell).
 
 By default, Excel locates the search string in the contents of each cell as 
entered on the Formula bar. This means that if you’re looking for a cell 
that contains 1,250 and the spreadsheet contains the formula =750+500, 
whose calculated value as displayed in the cell is 1,250, Excel won’t 
consider this cell to be a match because in searching the Formula bar, it 
finds =750+500 instead of 1,250.

220
Find and Replace This Disgrace!
 
 To have Excel search the contents of each cell (and thus, consider a cell 
that displays your value to be a match even when its contents on the 
Formula bar don’t contain the search string), you need to change the 
Look In setting from Formulas to Values. If you want Excel to search for 
the search string in the comments you’ve added to cells, you need to 
change the Look In setting to Comments.
 
7. Click Values on the Look In drop-down menu to have Excel locate the 
search string in the contents of each cell as it’s displayed in the work-
sheet. Click Comments on this pop-up menu instead to have Excel 
locate the search string in the comments that you’ve added to cells.
 
 Note that when you select Comments to search the comments you’ve 
added to the spreadsheet, you can’t specify any formatting to search for 
because the Format button in the Find and Replace dialog box becomes 
grayed out.
 
 By default, Excel ignores case differences between the search string and 
the content of the cells being searched so that Assets, ASSETS, and assets all 
match the search string, Assets. To find only exact matches, follow Step 8.
 
8. Click the Match Case check box to find occurrences of the search 
string when it matches the case that you entered.
 
 By default, Excel considers any occurrence of the search string to be a 
match — even when it occurs as part of another part of the cell entry. So 
when the search string is 25, cells containing 25, 15.25, 25 Main Street, 
and 250,000 are all considered matches. To find only complete occur-
rences of your search string in a cell, follow Step 9.
 
9. Click the Match Entire Cell Contents check box to find occurrences of 
the search string only when it’s the entire cell entry.
 
 After you’ve entered the search string and search options as you want 
them, you’re ready to start searching the spreadsheet.
 
10. Click the Find All button to find all occurrences of the search string. 
Click the Find Next button to find just the first occurrence of the 
search string.
 
 When you click Find All, Excel lists all the cells containing the search 
string in a list box at the bottom of the Find and Replace dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 3-16. You can then have Excel select the cell with a partic-
ular occurrence by clicking its link in this list box. You may have to drag 
the Find and Replace dialog box out of the way to see the selected cell.
 
 When you click Find Next, Excel selects the next cell in the spreadsheet 
(using the designated search direction). To find subsequent occurrences 
of the search string, you need to continue to click Find Next until you 
reach the cell that you’re looking for. Again, you may have to drag the 
Find and Replace dialog box out of the way to see the cell that Excel has 
located and selected in the worksheet.

Note that Excel retains your search string and search option conditions even 
after closing the Find and Replace dialog box. To repeat a search, just press 
Ctrl+F and then click Find All or Find Next. You can also reinstate a search 
string that you used earlier in your work session by clicking it on the Find 
What drop-down menu.
Finding and replacing stuff
The Find feature is sufficient if all you want to do is locate an occurrence of a 
search string in your worksheet. Many times, however, you will also want to 
change some or all of the cells that match the search string. For those situa-
tions, you use the Replace feature to locate the search string and replace it 
with some other string.
To search and replace information in your worksheet, follow these steps:
 
1. To search and replace the entire worksheet, select a single cell. To 
restrict the search and replace operation to a specific cell, range, or 
nonadjacent selection, select all the cells to be searched.
 
2. Click the Replace option on the Find & Select button’s drop-down 
menu on the Ribbon’s Home tab or press Ctrl+H.
 
 Excel opens the Find and Replace dialog box with the Replace tab 
selected (similar to the one shown in Figure 3-17). Note that if the Find 
and Replace dialog box is already open from clicking the Find option on 
the Find & Select button’s drop-down menu or pressing Ctrl+F, all you 
have to do is click the Replace tab.
 
3. Type the search string that you want to locate in the Find What combo 
box and specify any formatting to be searched by using its Format 
button.

222
Find and Replace This Disgrace!
 
 Refer back to the previous steps on finding a search string for details on 
specifying the search string in the Find What combo box and specifying 
the formatting to be searched for.
 
4. Type the replacement string in the Replace With combo box.
 
 Enter this string exactly as you want it to appear in the cells of the work-
sheet. Use uppercase letters where uppercase is to appear, lowercase 
letters where lowercase is to appear, and the question mark and asterisk 
only where they are to appear (they don’t act as wildcard characters in 
a replacement string).
 
5. Click the Options button and then click the Format drop-down button 
and select Format to select the formatting to be added to your 
replacement string from the Find Format dialog box. Or click Choose 
Format from Cell and select the formatting directly from a cell in the 
worksheet.
 
 When you click the Format item, Excel opens a Find Format dialog box 
with the same tabs and options as the standard Format Cells dialog box. 
You may then select the formatting that you want the replacement string 
to have in this dialog box and then click OK.
 
 When you click the Choose Format from Cell item on the Format button 
pop-up menu, the Find and Replace dialog box temporarily disappears 
until you click the cell in the worksheet that contains the formatting 
that you want the replacement string to have with the thick, white-cross 
mouse pointer with eyedropper icon.
 
6. Make any necessary changes to the Within, Search, Look In, Match 
Case, and Match Entire Cell Contents options for the search string.
 
 These options work just as they do on the Find tab. If these options 
aren’t displayed on the Replace tab of your Find and Replace dialog box, 
click its Options button to expand the dialog box.
 
7. Click the Find Next button to locate the first occurrence of the search 
string. Then, click the Replace button to replace the first occurrence 
with the replacement string or click the Find Next button again to skip 
this occurrence.
 
 Using the Find Next and Replace buttons to search and replace on a 
case-by-case basis is by far the safest way to use the Find and Replace 
feature. If you’re certain (really certain) that you won’t mess up anything 
by replacing all occurrences throughout the spreadsheet, you can click 
the Replace All button to have Excel make the replacements globally 
without stopping to show you which cells are updated.
 
8. When you finish replacing entries on a case-by-case basis, click the 
Close button.

You can use Excel’s Spell Check feature to catch all the spelling mistakes 
that AutoCorrect lets slip through. To spell check your spreadsheet, click 
the Spelling button at the beginning of the Ribbon’s Review tab or press 
Alt+RS or, simply, F7.
When you spell check a spreadsheet, Excel looks up each word in the Excel 
Dictionary. If the word is not found (as is often the case with less-common 
last names, abbreviations, acronyms, and technical terms), Excel selects the 
cell with the unknown spelling and then displays a Spelling dialog box show-
ing the unknown word in the Not in Dictionary text box with suggested cor-
rect spellings shown in a Suggestions list box below, which is similar to the 
one shown in Figure 3-18.

You can then take any of the following actions to take care of the unknown 
word:
 
✦ Click one of the words in the Suggestions list box and then click the 
Change button to have Excel replace the unknown word with the selected 
suggestion and continue spell checking the rest of the spreadsheet.
 
✦ Click one of the words in the Suggestions list box and then click the 
Change All button to have Excel replace all occurrences of the unknown 
word with the selected suggestion throughout the entire spreadsheet 
and then continue spell checking.
 
✦ Click the Ignore Once button to let the misspelling slide just this once 
and continue spell checking the rest of the spreadsheet.
 
✦ Click the Ignore All button to ignore all occurrences of the unknown 
word in the spreadsheet and continue spell checking.
 
✦ Click the Add to Dictionary button to add the unknown word to a 
custom dictionary so that Excel will know the word the next time you 
spell check the worksheet.
 
✦ Click the AutoCorrect button to have Excel add the unknown word 
to the AutoCorrect list with the selected suggestion as its automatic 
replacement.
 
Keep in mind that Excel checks the spelling of the cells only in the current 
worksheet (and not all the sheets in the workbook). If you want Excel to 
spell check another worksheet, you need to click its sheet tab to make it 
active and then click the Spelling button on the Review tab (or press F7). If 
you want to spell check just a portion of the worksheet, select the range or 
nonadjacent cell selection before you start the spell check.
When Excel finishes checking the current worksheet or cell selection, the 
program displays an alert dialog box that indicates that the spell checking 
has been completed.
Changing the spelling options
When you use the Spell Check feature, you can change certain spelling 
options to better suit the spreadsheet that you’re checking. To change 
the spelling options, click the Options button at the bottom of the Spelling 
dialog box. This action opens the Proofing tab of the Excel Options dialog 
box with the following options in the When Correcting Spelling in Microsoft 
Office Programs section:
 
✦ Ignore Words in UPPERCASE: Remove the check mark from the check 
box so that Excel marks acronyms and other words entered in all upper-
case letters as misspellings.

✦ Ignore Words That Contain Numbers: Remove the check mark from the 
check box so that Excel marks words such as B52 that contain letters 
and numbers as misspellings.
 
✦ Ignore Internet and File Addresses: Remove the check mark from 
the check box so that Excel marks Web URL addresses such as www.
dummies.com and file pathnames such as c:\documents\finance as 
misspellings.
 
✦ Flag Repeated Words: Remove the check mark so that Excel no longer 
marks repeated words such as Bora Bora as misspellings.
 
✦ Enforce Accented Uppercase in French: Add a check mark so that Excel 
marks uppercase French words that don’t have the proper accent marks 
as misspellings.
 
✦ Suggest from Main Dictionary Only: Have Excel use only the main dic-
tionary when doing a spell check (thus, ignoring all words that you’ve 
added to a custom dictionary).
 
✦ Custom Dictionaries: Open the Custom Dictionaries dialog box where 
you can edit the words in a custom dictionary or add a new custom dic-
tionary to be used in spell checking (see “Adding words to the custom 
dictionary” that follows).
 
✦ French Modes, Spanish Modes, or Brazilian Modes: Choose between 
the traditional or more modern spellings of French, Spanish, or Brazilian 
Portuguese words, respectively.
 
✦ Dictionary Language: Specify the language and country of the diction-
ary to use in spell checking the worksheet.
Adding words to the custom dictionary
You use the Add to Dictionary button in the Spelling dialog box to add 
unknown words to a custom dictionary. By default, Excel adds words to a 
custom dictionary file named CUSTOM.DIC. This file is located in the UProof 
folder, which is located within the Microsoft folder inside the Application 
Data folder. The Application Data folder is either inside the Windows User 
folder on your C: drive or, if you’re on a network, this file may be located in 
your user name folder inside the Profiles folder that lies within the Windows 
folder on your C: drive.
If you want, you can create other custom dictionaries to use when spell 
checking your worksheets. To create a new custom dictionary, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Custom Dictionaries button in the When Correcting Spelling 
in Microsoft Office Programs section of the Proofing tab.
 
 Excel opens the Custom Dictionaries dialog box, where you can create a 
new custom dictionary to use.

226
Looking Up and Translating Stuff
 
2. Click the New button in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box.
 
 Excel opens the Create Custom Dictionary dialog box.
 
3. Type the name for your new custom dictionary and then click the 
Save button.
 
 After the Create Custom Dictionary dialog box closes, the name of 
the custom dictionary you created appears underneath CUSTOM.DIC 
(Default) in the Dictionary List box.
 
4. (Optional) To restrict the language of a custom dictionary, click the 
language in the Dictionary Language drop-down list after clicking the 
dictionary’s name in the Dictionary List box to select it.
 
5. To make the new custom dictionary the default dictionary into which 
new words are saved, click the dictionary’s name in the Dictionary list 
box to select it and then click the Change Default button.
 
6. Click OK to close the Custom Dictionaries dialog box and then click 
OK again to close the Excel Options dialog box.
 
 Excel returns you to the Spelling dialog box.
 
7. Click the Add to Dictionary button to add the unknown word to the 
new default custom dictionary and then continue spell checking your 
spreadsheet.
Note that Excel continues to add all unknown words to your new custom 
dictionary until you change the default back to the original custom diction-
ary (or to another custom one that you’ve created). To change back and 
start adding unknown words to the original custom dictionary, select the 
CUSTOM.DIC file in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box and then click the 
Change Default button.
 
You can directly edit the words that you add to your custom diction-
ary. Click the Custom Dictionaries button on the Proofing tab of the Excel 
Options dialog box (File➪Options➪Proofing or Alt+FIP) and then click the 
Edit Word List command button. Excel then opens a dialog box with the 
default dictionary’s name that contains a Word(s) text box where you can 
enter new words to add to the custom dictionary and a Dictionary list box 
below that lists all the words added to the dictionary in alphabetical order. 
To add a new word to the dictionary, type it in the Word(s) text box (care-
fully, you don’t want to add a misspelling to the dictionary) and then click 
the Add button. To remove a word, click it in the Dictionary list box and 
then click the Delete button.
Looking Up and Translating Stuff
In addition to the very useful Spelling button (discussed in the previous sec-
tion), the Proofing and Language groups on the Review tab contains three 
other command buttons that can come in handy from time to time:

Worksheets
227
Looking Up and Translating Stuff
 
✦ Research opens the Research pane with the All Reference Books option 
selected where you can look up text that you enter in the Search For text 
box or the contents of the current cell automatically entered into this 
text box.
 
✦ Thesaurus opens the Research pane with the Thesaurus option 
selected. Here you can look up synonyms for a particular term that you 
enter into the Search For text box or for the contents of the current cell 
automatically entered into this text box.
 
✦ Translate opens the Research pane with the Translation option 
selected. Here you can look up a translation for a particular term that 
you enter into the Search For text box or for the contents of the current 
cell automatically entered into this text box in the language listed in the 
To drop-down list box.
 
When the Research Task pane is open, you can change the online resource 
to use when looking up the term in the Search For text box by selecting it 
on the Show Results From drop-down list box immediately beneath. These 
online resources include such sites as the Encarta Dictionary, Thesaurus 
(available for a variety of European languages), Translation (for translat-
ing to and from English and a variety of languages), Encarta Encyclopedia, 
Factiva iWorks, HighBeam Research, Live Search (for Web searches), MSN 
Money Stock Quotes, and Thomson Gale Company Profiles (for the latest 
stock info and business information).
After you click the Start Searching button (the arrow pointing to the right in 
the green square to the immediate right of the Search For text box) or you 
select a new online resource, Excel searches for your search text online in 
the selected resources, and the program displays these results in the lower 
part of the Research Task pane (beneath the Show Results From drop-down 
list box and the Back button). Depending on the resource used, these results 
may appear in the form of links to specific Web pages that you can pursue 
by clicking them or in the form of listed information that you can read in the 
Research Task pane.
When you click a Web link in the research results, Excel opens your Web 
browser (usually Microsoft Internet Explorer 8, which ships with Microsoft 
Office 2010) where it displays the targeted linked page. After you finish read-
ing its information and/or following the links on its page, you can return 
to Excel by clicking the Close button in the upper-right corner of the Web 
browser window.
 
To change which online resources appear on the Show Results From drop-
down menu, click the Research Options link that appears at the very bottom 
of the Research Task pane. When you click this link, Excel opens a Research 
Options dialog box that enables you to add or remove particular reference 
books and sites by either removing or adding check marks to their check 
box items. To widen or narrow the Research Task pane, position the mouse 

228
Marking Invalid Data
pointer on the border between the right edge of the Excel program window 
and the Task pane and then when the pointer becomes a two-headed arrow, 
drag to the left (to widen) or right (to narrow).
Marking Invalid Data
In addition to using the Data Validation feature to restrict what kind of data 
can be entered into cell ranges of a worksheet, you can use it to mark all 
the data (by circling their cells) that are outside of expected or allowable 
parameters.
To use the Data Validation feature in this way, you follow this general 
procedure:
 
✦ Select the cell range(s) in the worksheet that need to be validated and 
marked.
 
✦ Open the Data Validation dialog box by clicking the Data Validation 
button on the Data tab of the Ribbon or by pressing Alt+AVV, and then 
use its options to set up the validation criteria that determine which 
values in the selected cell range are out of bounds (see Book II, Chapter 
1 for details).
 
✦ Click the Circle Invalid Data option on the Data Validation button’s drop-
down list on the Data tab of the Ribbon.
Figure 3-19 shows an example of how you might use Data Validation to mark 
entries that are below a certain threshold. In this case, I set it up for Excel to 
mark all subtotal monthly sales cells entries in the range D4:D15 in the 2010 
Sales worksheet that are above $50,000 by drawing a red circle around their 
cells.
To set this up in the 2010 Sales worksheet, I followed these three steps:
 
✦ Selected the cell range (D4:D15) with monthly sales data for the year.
 
✦ Opened the Data Validation dialog box (Alt+AVV) and then on the 
Settings tab selected Decimal in the Allow drop-down list and Greater 
Than in the Data drop-down list, and entered 50000 in the Minimum text 
box before clicking OK.
 
✦ Clicked the Circle Invalid Data option on the Data Validation button’s 
drop-down menu on the Data tab (you can also press Alt+AVI).
 
To remove the circles from the cells marked as invalid, click the Clear 
Validation Circles option on the Data Validation button’s drop-down menu 
or press Alt+AVR. To clear the validation settings from the cells, select the 
range, then open the Data Validation dialog box and click its Clear All button 
before you click OK.

Eliminating Errors with Text to Speech
Find and Replace is a great tool for eliminating errors that you’ve flagged in 
the worksheet. Likewise, the Spell Check feature is great for eliminating input 
errors that result from typos. Unfortunately, neither of these features can help 
you to identify data input errors that result from actions, such as mistyping 
the entry (without misspelling it) or transposing one entry with another.
The only way that you can flag and then correct these errors is by checking 
and verifying the accuracy of each and every data entry in the worksheet. 
Usually, you do this by checking the columns and rows of data in a spread-
sheet against the original documents from which you generated the spread-
sheet. Excel’s Text to Speech feature can help in this checking by reading 
aloud each entry that’s been made in a selected range of cells or data table 
within the worksheet. As the data entries are read aloud, you can then verify 
their accuracy against documents used in the original data entry.
 
The Text to Speech translation feature requires no prior training or special 
microphones: All that’s required is a pair of speakers or headphones con-
nected to your computer.
Unfortunately, the various Text to Speech command buttons are not avail-
able from any of the tabs on the Ribbon. The only way to access them is 
by adding their command buttons either as custom buttons on the Quick 
Access toolbar or to a custom tab on the Ribbon. Figure 3-20 shows the 
Ribbon on my copy of Excel 2010 after I’ve added a Text to Speech group to 
a custom Misc tab. As you can see, this custom group contains the Speak 
Cells, Speak Cells - Stop Speaking Cells, Speak Cells by Columns, Speak Cells 
by Rows, and Speak Cells on Enter buttons needed to check cell entries by 
having them read aloud.

232
Eliminating Errors with Text to Speech
After adding the Text to Speech buttons to the Quick Access toolbar or a 
tab of the Ribbon, you can use them to corroborate spreadsheet entries and 
catch those hard-to-spot errors as follows:
 
1. Select the cells in the worksheet whose contents you want read aloud 
by Text to Speech.
 
 If you want to check a table of data, simply position the cell cursor in the 
first cell and Excel will then automatically select the entire table when 
you click the Speak Cells button.
 
2. Click the Speak Cells button to have the computer begin reading back 
the entries in the selected cells.
 
 The Text to Speech feature reads the contents of each cell in the cell 
selection by first reading down each column and then across the rows.
 
3. To pause the Text to Speech feature when you locate a discrepancy 
between what you’re reading and what you’re hearing, click the 
Speak Cells - Stop Speaking button.
 
Keep in mind that you can click the Speak Cells on Enter button to have your 
computer speak each new entry that you make as you complete it by press-
ing the Enter key. Excel also moves the cell cursor down one row.

B
eing able to manage and reorganize the information in your spread-
sheet is almost as important as being able to input data and edit it. As 
part of these skills, you need to know how to manipulate the columns and 
rows of a single worksheet, the various worksheets within a single work-
book, and, at times, other workbooks that contain supporting or relevant 
data.
This chapter examines how to reorganize information in a single worksheet 
by inserting and deleting columns and rows, as well as how to apply out-
lining to data tables that enables you to expand and collapse details by 
showing and hiding columns and rows. It also covers how to reorganize and 
manipulate the actual worksheets in a workbook and discusses strategies 
for visually comparing and transferring data between the different work-
books that you have open for editing.
Reorganizing the Worksheet
Every Excel 2010 worksheet that you work with has 16,384 columns and 
1,048,576 rows — no more, no less, regardless of how many or how few of 
its cells you use. As your spreadsheet grows, you may find it beneficial to 
rearrange the data so that it doesn’t creep. Many times, this involves delet-
ing unnecessary columns and rows to bring the various data tables and lists 
in closer proximity to each other. At other times, you may need to insert 
new columns and rows in the worksheet so as to put a minimum of space 
between the groups of data.

234
Reorganizing the Worksheet
Within the confines of this humongous worksheet space, your main chal-
lenge is often keeping tabs on all the information spread out throughout the 
sheet. At times, you may find that you need to split the worksheet window 
into panes so that you can view two disparate regions of the spreadsheet 
together in the same window and compare their data. For large data tables 
and lists, you may want to outline the worksheet data so that you can imme-
diately collapse the information down to the summary or essential data and 
then just as quickly expand the information to show some or all of the sup-
porting data.
Inserting and deleting columns and rows
The first thing to keep in mind when inserting or deleting columns and rows 
in a worksheet is that these operations affect all 1,048,576 rows in those col-
umns and all 16,384 columns in those rows. As a result, you have to be sure 
that you’re not about to adversely affect data in unseen rows and columns of 
the sheet before you undertake these operations. Note that, in this regard, 
inserting columns or rows can be almost as detrimental as deleting them 
if, by inserting them, you split apart existing data tables or lists whose data 
should always remain together.
One way to guard against inadvertently deleting existing data or splitting 
apart a single range is to use the Zoom slider on the Status bar to zoom out 
on the sheet and then check visually for intersecting groups of data in the 
hinterlands of the worksheet. You can do this quickly by dragging the Zoom 
slider button to the left to the 25% setting. Of course, even at the smallest 
zoom setting of 10%, you can see neither all the columns nor all the rows in 
the worksheet, and because everything’s so tiny at that setting, you can’t 
always tell whether or not the column or row you intend to fiddle with inter-
sects those data ranges that you can identify.
Another way to check is to press End+→ or End+↓ to move the cell pointer 
from data range to data range across the column or row affected by your 
column or row deletion. Remember that pressing End plus an arrow key 
when the cell pointer is in a blank cell jumps the cell pointer to the next 
occupied cell in its row or column. That means if you press End+→ when the 
cell pointer is in row 52 and the pointer jumps to cell XFD52 (the end of the 
worksheet in that row), you know that there isn’t any data in that row that 
would be eliminated by your deleting that row or shifted up or down by your 
inserting a new row. So too, if you press End+↓ when the cell pointer is in 
column D and the cell pointer jumps down to cell D1048576, you’re assured 
that no data is about to be purged or shifted left or right by that column’s 
deletion or a new column’s insertion at that point.
When you’re sure that you aren’t about to make any problems for yourself 
in other, unseen parts of the worksheet by deleting or inserting columns, 
you’re ready to make these structural changes to the worksheet.

Reorganizing the Worksheet
Eradicating columns and rows
To delete columns or rows of the worksheet, select them by clicking their 
column letters or row numbers in the column or row header and then click 
the Delete button in the Cells group on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Remember 
that you can select groups of columns and rows by dragging through their 
letters and numbers in the column or row header. You can also select non-
adjacent columns and rows by holding down the Ctrl key as you click them.
When you delete a column, all the data entries within the cells of that 
column are immediately zapped. At the same time, all remaining data entries 
in succeeding columns to the right move left to fill the blank left by the now-
missing column. When you delete a row, all the data entries within the cells 
of that row are immediately eliminated, and the remaining data entries in 
rows below move up to fill in the gap left by the missing row.
 
You can also delete rows and columns of the worksheet corresponding to 
those that are a part of the current cell selection in the worksheet by click-
ing the drop-down button attached to the Delete command button on the 
Home tab of the Ribbon and then clicking the Delete Sheet Rows or Delete 
Sheet Columns option, respectively, on its drop-down menu. If you find you 
can’t safely delete an entire column or row, delete the cells you need to get 
rid of in the particular region of the worksheet instead by selecting them and 
then clicking the Delete Cells option on the Delete command button’s drop-
down list (see Book II, Chapter 3 for details).
 
Remember that pressing the Delete key is not the same as clicking the Delete 
button on the Home tab of the Ribbon. When you press the Delete key after 
selecting columns or rows in the worksheet, Excel simply clears the data 
entries in their cells without adjusting any of the existing data entries in 
neighboring columns and rows. Click the Delete command button on the 
Home tab when your purpose is both to delete the data in the selected col-
umns or rows and to fill in the gap by adjusting the position of entries to the 
right and below the ones you eliminate.
 
Should your row or column deletions remove data entries referenced in for-
mulas, the #REF! error value replaces the calculated values in the cells of the 
formulas affected by the elimination of the original cell references. You must 
then either restore the deleted rows or columns or re-create the original for-
mula and then recopy it to get rid of these nasty formula errors. (See Book 
III, Chapter 2 for more on error values in formulas.)
Adding new columns and rows
To insert a new column or row into the worksheet, you select the column or 
row where you want the new blank column or row to appear (again by clicking 
its column letter or row number in the column or row header) and then click 
the Insert command button in the Cells group of the Ribbon’s Home tab.

236
Reorganizing the Worksheet
In inserting a blank column, Excel moves the existing data in the selected 
column to the column to the immediate right, while simultaneously moving 
any other columns of data on the right over one. In inserting the blank row, 
Excel moves the existing data in the selected row down to the row immedi-
ately underneath, while simultaneously adjusting any other rows of existing 
data that fall below it down by one.
To insert multiple columns or rows at one time in the worksheet, select the 
columns or rows where you want the new blank columns or rows to appear 
(by dragging through their column letters and row numbers in the column 
and row header) before you click the Insert command button on the Home 
tab of the Ribbon.
 
You can also insert new rows and columns of the worksheet correspond-
ing to those that are a part of the current cell selection in the worksheet 
by clicking the drop-down button attached to the Insert command button 
on the Home tab and then clicking the Insert Sheet Rows or Insert Sheet 
Columns option, respectively, on its drop-down menu. If you find that you 
can’t safely insert an entire column or row, insert the blank cells you need 
in the particular region of the worksheet instead by selecting their cells and 
then clicking the Insert Cells option on the Insert command button’s drop-
down list (see Book II, Chapter 3 for details).
 
Whenever your column or row insertions reposition data entries that are 
referenced in other formulas in the worksheet, Excel automatically adjusts 
the cell references in the formulas affected to reflect the movement of their 
columns left or right, or rows up or down.
Splitting the worksheet into panes
Excel enables you to split the active worksheet window into two or four 
panes, each of which is equipped with its own scroll bars. After splitting up 
the window into panes, you can then use the pane’s scroll bars to bring dif-
ferent parts of the same worksheet into view. This is great for comparing the 
data in different sections of a table that would otherwise not be legible if you 
zoomed out far enough to have both sections displayed in the worksheet 
window.
To split the worksheet window into panes, you can use any of the following 
methods:
 
✦ To split the window horizontally into two panes (upper and lower), drag 
the horizontal split bar (the thin bar located above the up scroll arrow 
on the vertical scroll bar) down until you reach the row border in the 
worksheet where you want the window divided.
 
✦ To split the window vertically into two panes (left and right), drag the 
vertical split bar (the thin bar located behind the right scroll arrow on 
the horizontal scroll bar) to the left until you reach the column border in 
the worksheet where you want the window divided.

Book II
Chapter 4
Managing
Worksheets
237
Reorganizing the Worksheet
 
✦ To split the window both horizontally and vertically into four panes 
(upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right), drag the horizontal 
split bar down to the desired row and then the vertical split bar left to 
the desired column (or vice versa).
Note that you can also split the window by positioning the cell pointer posi-
tion in the worksheet in the cell whose top border marks the place where 
you want the horizontal division to take place and whose left border marks 
the place where you want the vertical division to take place before clicking 
the Split button on the View tab of the Ribbon (or pressing Alt+WS).
Excel displays the borders of the window panes you create in the document 
window with a bar that ends with the vertical or horizontal split bar. To 
modify the size of a pane, you position the white-cross pointer on the appro-
priate dividing bar. Then as soon as the pointer changes to a double-headed 
arrow, drag the bar until the pane is the correct size and release the mouse 
button.
When you split a window into panes, Excel automatically synchronizes 
the scrolling, depending on how you split the worksheet. When you split a 
window into two horizontal panes, as shown in Figure 4-1, the worksheet 
window contains a single horizontal scroll bar and two separate vertical 
scroll bars. This means that all horizontal scrolling of the two panes is syn-
chronized, while the vertical scrolling of each pane remains independent.

238
Reorganizing the Worksheet
When you split a window into two vertical panes, as shown in Figure 4-2, the 
situation is reversed. The worksheet window contains a single vertical scroll 
bar and two separate horizontal scroll bars. This means that all vertical 
scrolling of the two panes is synchronized, while horizontal scrolling of each 
pane remains independent.
 
Figure 4-2:

When you split a window into two horizontal and two vertical panes, as 
shown in Figure 4-3, the worksheet window contains two horizontal scroll 
bars and two separate vertical scroll bars. This means that vertical scrolling 
is synchronized in the top two window panes when you use the top vertical 
scroll bar and synchronized for the bottom two window panes when you use 
the bottom vertical scroll bar. Likewise, horizontal scrolling is synchronized 
for the left two window panes when you use the horizontal scroll bar on the 
left, and synchronized for the right two window panes when you use the 
horizontal scroll bar on the right.
To remove all panes from a window when you no longer need them, you 
simply click the Split button on the View tab of the Ribbon, press Alt+WS, 
or drag the dividing bar either for the horizontal or vertical pane until you 
reach one of the edges of the worksheet window. You can also remove a 
pane by positioning the mouse pointer on a pane-dividing bar and then, 
when it changes to a double-headed arrow, double-clicking it.

Keep in mind that you can freeze panes in the window so that information 
in the upper pane and/or in the leftmost pane remains in the worksheet 
window at all times, no matter what other columns and rows you scroll to or 
how much you zoom in and out on the data. (See Book II, Chapter 3 for more 
on freezing panes.)
Outlining worksheets
The Outline feature enables you to control the level of detail displayed in a 
data table or list in a worksheet. After outlining a table or list, you can con-
dense the table’s display when you want to use only certain levels of sum-
mary information, and you can just as easily expand the outlined table or 
list to display various levels of detail data as needed. Being able to control 
which outline level is displayed in the worksheet makes it easy to print sum-
mary reports with various levels of data (see Book II, Chapter 5) as well as to 
chart just the summary data (see Book V, Chapter 1).
Spreadsheet outlines are a little different from the outlines you created in 
high school and college. In those outlines, you placed the headings at the 
highest level (I.) at the top of the outline with the intermediate headings 
indented below. Most worksheet outlines, however, seem backward in the 
sense that the highest level summary row and column are located at the 
bottom and far right of the table or list of data, with the columns and rows of 
intermediate supporting data located above and to the left of the summary 
row and column.

240
Reorganizing the Worksheet
The reason that worksheet outlines often seem “backwards” when compared 
to word processing outlines is that, most often, to calculate your summary 
totals in the worksheet, you naturally place the detail levels of data above 
the summary rows and to the left of the summary columns that total them. 
When creating a word processing outline, however, you place the major 
headings above subordinate headings, while at the same time indenting each 
subordinate level, reflecting the way we read words from left to right and 
down the page.
Outlines for data tables (as opposed to data lists) are also different from reg-
ular word processed outlines because they outline the data in not one, but 
two hierarchies: a vertical hierarchy that summarizes the row data, and a 
horizontal hierarchy that summarizes the column data. (You don’t get much 
of that in your regular term paper!)
Creating the outline
To create an outline from a table of data, position the cell cursor in the table 
or list containing the data to be outlined, and then click the Auto Outline 
option on the Group command button’s drop-down menu on the Data tab on 
the Ribbon (or press Alt+AGA).
By default, Excel assumes that summary rows in the selected data table are 
below their detail data, and summary columns are to the right of their detail 
data, which is normally the case. If, however, the summary rows are above 
the detail data, and summary columns are to the left of the detail data, Excel 
can still build the outline.
Simply start by clicking the Dialog Box Launcher button in the lower-right 
corner of the Outline group on the Data tab of the Ribbon to open the 
Settings dialog box. In the Settings dialog box, clear the check marks from 
the Summary Rows below Detail and/or Summary Columns to Right of Detail 
check boxes in the Direction section. Also, you can have Excel automati-
cally apply styles to different levels of the outline by selecting the Automatic 
Styles check box. (For more information on these styles, see the “Applying 
outline styles” section, later in this chapter.) To have Excel create the 
outline, click the Create button — if you click the OK button, the program 
simply closes the dialog box without outlining the selected worksheet data.
Figure 4-4 shows you the first part of the outline created by Excel for the CG 
Media 2010 Sales worksheet. Note the various outline symbols that Excel 
added to the worksheet when it created the outline. Figure 4-4 identifies 
most of these outline symbols (the Show Detail button with the plus sign is 
not displayed in this figure), and Table 4-1 explains their functions.

below).

box on the Advanced tab in the Excel Options dialog box (Alt+FIA) is not 
checked. All you have to do is press Ctrl+8 to display the outline symbols. 
Keep in mind that Ctrl+8 is a toggle that you can press again to hide the out-
line symbols.

242
Reorganizing the Worksheet
 
You can have only one outline per worksheet. If you’ve already outlined one 
table and then try to outline another table on the same worksheet, Excel will 
display the Modify Existing Outline alert box when you choose the Outline 
command. If you click OK, Excel adds the outlining for the new table to the 
existing outline for the first table (even though the tables are nonadjacent). 
To create separate outlines for different data tables, you need to place each 
table on a different worksheet of the workbook.
Applying outline styles
You can apply predefined row and column outline styles to the table or list 
data. To apply these styles when creating the outline, be sure to select the 
Automatic Styles check box in the Settings dialog box before you click its 
Create button, opened by clicking the Dialog Box Launcher button in the 
Outline group on the Data tab of the Ribbon. If you didn’t select this check 
box in the Settings dialog box before you created the outline, you can do so 
afterwards by selecting all the cells in the outlined table of data, opening the 
Settings dialog box, clicking the Automatic Styles check box to put a check 
mark in it, and then clicking the Apply Styles button before you click OK.
Figure 4-5 shows you the sample CG Media Sales table after applying the 
automatic row and column styles to the outlined table data. In this example, 
Excel applied two row styles (RowLevel_1 and RowLevel_2) and two column 
styles (ColLevel_1 and ColLevel_2) to the worksheet table.

The RowLevel_1 style is applied to the entries in the first-level summary row 
(row 21) and makes the font appear in bold. The ColLevel_1 style is applied 
to the data in the first-level summary column (column R, which isn’t shown 
in the figure), and it, too, simply makes the font bold. The RowLevel_2 style 
is applied to the data in the second-level rows (rows 8 and 20), and this style 
adds italics to the font. The ColLevel_2 style is applied to all second-level 
summary columns (columns E, I, M, and Q), and it also italicizes the font.
Displaying and hiding different outline levels
The real effectiveness of outlining worksheet data becomes apparent only 
when you start using the various outline symbols to change the way the 
table data are displayed in the worksheet. By clicking the appropriate row 
or column level symbol, you can immediately hide detail rows and columns 
to display just the summary information in the table. For example, Figure 4-6 
shows you the CG Media Sales table after clicking the number 2 Row Level 
button and number 2 Column Level button. Here, you see only the first- and 
second-level summary information, that is, the totals for the quarterly and 
annual totals for the two types of media.

You can also hide and display levels of the outlined data by positioning the 
cell cursor in the column or row and then clicking the Hide Detail (the one 
with the red minus sign) or the Show Detail button (the one with the green 
minus sign) in the Outline group of the Data tab of the Ribbon. Or you can 

244
Reorganizing the Worksheet
press the hot keys, Alt+AH, to hide an outline level, and Alt+AJ to redisplay 
the level. The great thing about using these command buttons or their hot 
key equivalents is that they work even when the outline symbols are not dis-
played in the worksheet.
Figure 4-7 shows you the same table, this time after clicking the number 1 
Row Level button and number 1 Column Level button. Here, you see only 
the first-level summary for the column and the row, that is, the grand total 
of the annual CG Media sales. To expand this view horizontally to see the 
total sales for each quarter, you would simply click the number 2 Column 
Level button. To expand this view even further horizontally to display each 
monthly total in the worksheet, you would click the number 3 Column Level 
button. So too, to expand the outline vertically to see totals for each type 
of media, you would click the number 2 Row Level button. To expand the 
outline one more level vertically so that you can see the sales for each type 
of music as well as each type of media, you would click the number 3 Row 
Level button.

When displaying different levels of detail in a worksheet outline, you can 
use the Hide Detail and Show Detail buttons along with the Row Level and 
Column Level buttons. For example, Figure 4-8 shows you another view of 
the CG Media outlined sales table. Here, in the horizontal dimension, you see

Reorganizing the Worksheet
all three column levels have been expanded, including the monthly detail 
columns for each quarter. In the vertical dimension, however, only the detail 
rows for the CD sales have been expanded. The detail rows for cassette tape 
sales are still collapsed.
To create this view of the outline, you simply click the number 2 Column 
Level and Row Level buttons, and then click only the Show Detail (+) button 
located to the left of the Total CD Sales row heading. When you want to view 
only the summary-level rows for each media type, you can click the Hide 
Detail (–) button to the left of the Total CD Sales heading, or you can click its 
level bar (drawn from the collapse symbol up to the first music type to indi-
cate all the details rows included in that level).
 
Excel adjusts the outline levels displayed on the screen by hiding and redis-
playing entire columns and rows in the worksheet. Therefore, keep in mind 
that changes that you make that reduce the number of levels displayed in 
the outlined table also hide the display of all data outside of the outlined 
table that are in the affected rows and columns.
 
After selecting the rows and columns you want displayed, you can then 
remove the outline symbols from the worksheet display to maximize the 
amount of data displayed on-screen. To do this, simply press Ctrl+8.

Reorganizing the Worksheet
Manually adjusting the outline levels
Most of the time, Excel’s Auto Outline feature correctly outlines the data 
in your table. Every once in a while, however, you will have to manually 
adjust one or more of the outline levels so that the outline’s summary rows 
and columns include the right detail rows and columns. To adjust levels of 
a worksheet outline, you must select the rows or columns that you want to 
promote to a higher level (that is, one with a lower level number) in the out-
line and then click the Group button on the far right side of the Data tab of 
the Ribbon. If you want to demote selected rows or columns to a lower level 
in the outline, select the rows or columns with a higher level number and 
then click the Ungroup button on the Data tab.
Before you use the Group and Ungroup buttons to change an outline level, 
you must select the rows or columns that you want to promote or demote. 
To select a particular outline level and all the rows and columns included in 
that level, you need to display the outline symbols (Ctrl+8), and then hold 
down the Shift key as you click its collapse or expand symbol. Note that 
when you click an expand symbol, Excel selects not only the rows or col-
umns visible at that level, but all the hidden rows and columns included in 
that level as well. If you want to select only a particular detail or summary 
row or column in the outline, you can click that row number or column letter 
in the worksheet window, or you can hold down the Shift key and click the 
dot (period) to the left of the row number or above the column letter in the 
outline symbols area.
If you select only a range of cells in the rows or columns (as opposed to 
entire rows and columns) before you click the Group and Ungroup com-
mand buttons, Excel displays the Group or Ungroup dialog box which con-
tains a Rows and Columns option button (with the Rows button selected by 
default). To promote or demote columns instead of rows, click the Columns 
option button before you select OK. To close the dialog box without promot-
ing or demoting any part of the outline, click Cancel.
To see how you can use the Group and Ungroup command buttons on the 
Data tab of the Ribbon to adjust outline levels, consider once again the CG 
Media Sales table outline. When Excel created this outline, the program did 
not include row 3 (which contains only the row heading, Compact Discs) in 
the outline. As a result, when you collapse the rows by selecting the number 
1 Row Level button to display only the first-level Total Sales summary row 
(refer to Figure 4-7), this row heading remains visible in the table, even 
though it should have been included and thereby hidden along with the 
other summary and detail rows.
You can use the Group command button to move this row (3) down a level 
so that it is included in the first level of the outline. You simply click the row 
number 3 to select the row and then click the Group command button on the 
Data tab (or press Alt+AGG). Figure 4-9 shows you the result of doing this. 
Notice how the outside level bar (for level 1) now includes this row. Now,

when you collapse the outline by clicking the number 1 row level button, the

Removing an outline
To delete an outline from your worksheet, you click the drop-down button 
attached to the Ungroup button on the Data tab of the Ribbon, and then click 
the Clear Outline option on its drop-down menu (or you press Alt+AUC). 
Note that removing the outline does not affect the data in any way — Excel 
merely removes the outline structure. Also note that it doesn’t matter what 
state the outline is in at the time you select this command. If the outline is 
partially or totally collapsed, deleting the outline automatically displays all 
the hidden rows and columns in the data table or list.
 
Keep in mind that restoring an outline that you’ve deleted is not one of the 
commands that you can undo (Ctrl+Z). If you delete an outline by mistake, 
you must re-create it all over again. For this reason, most often you’ll want to 
expand all the outline levels (by clicking the lowest number column and row 
level button) and then hide all the outline symbols by pressing Ctrl+8 rather 
than permanently remove the outline. Note that if you press Ctrl+8 when 
your spreadsheet table isn’t yet outlined, Excel displays an alert dialog box 
indicating that it can’t show the outline symbols because no outline exists. 
This alert also asks you if you want to create an outline. To go ahead and 
outline the spreadsheet, click OK or press Enter. To remove the alert dialog 
box without creating an outline, click Cancel.
Creating different custom views of the outline
After you’ve created an outline for your worksheet table, you can create 
custom views that display the table in various levels of detail. Then, instead 
of having to display the outline symbols and manually click the Show Detail 
and Hide Detail buttons or the appropriate row level buttons and/or column 
level buttons to view a particular level of detail, you simply select the appro-
priate outline view in the Custom Views dialog box (View➪Custom Views or 
Alt+WCV).
When creating custom views of outlined worksheet data, be sure that you 
leave the Hidden Rows, Columns, and Filter Settings check box selected in 
the Include in View section of the Add View dialog box. (See Book II, Chapter 
3 for details on creating and using custom views in a worksheet.)
Reorganizing the Workbook
Any new workbook that you open comes already equipped with three blank 
worksheets. Although most of the spreadsheets you create and work with 
may never wander beyond the confines of the first of these three sheets, you 
do need to know how to organize your spreadsheet information three-dimen-
sionally for those rare occasions when spreading all the information out in 
one humongous worksheet is not practical. However, the normal everyday 
problems related to keeping on top of the information in a single worksheet 

Book II
Chapter 4
Managing
Worksheets
249
Reorganizing the Workbook
can easily go off the scale when you begin to use multiple worksheets in a 
workbook. For this reason, you need to be sure that you are fully versed in 
the basics of using more than one worksheet in a workbook.
 
To move between the sheets in a workbook, you can click the sheet tab for 
that worksheet or press Ctrl+PgDn (next sheet) or Ctrl+PgUp (preceding 
sheet) until the sheet is selected. If the sheet tab for the worksheet you want 
is not displayed on the scroll bar at the bottom of the document window, 
use the tab scrolling buttons (the buttons with the left- and right-pointing 
triangles) to bring it into view.
To use the tab scrolling buttons, click the one with the right-pointing trian-
gle to bring the next sheet into view, and click the one with the left-pointing 
triangle to bring the preceding sheet into view. The tab scrolling buttons 
with the directional triangles pointing to vertical lines display the very first 
or very last group of sheet tabs in a workbook. The button with the triangle 
pointing left to a vertical line brings the first group of sheet tabs into view; 
the button with the triangle pointing right to a vertical line brings the last 
group of sheet tabs into view. When you scroll sheet tabs to find the one 
you’re looking for, for heaven’s sake, don’t forget to click the desired sheet 
tab to make the worksheet current.
Renaming sheets
The sheet tabs shown at the bottom of each workbook are the keys to keeping 
your place in a workbook. To tell which sheet is current, you have only to look 
at which sheet tab appears on the top, matches the background of the other 
cells in the worksheet, and has its name displayed in bold type. Typically, this 
means that the active sheet tab’s background appears in white in contrast to 
the nonactive sheet tabs, which sport a light gray background.
When you start a new workbook, the sheet tabs are all the same width 
because they all have the default sheet names (Sheet1, Sheet2, and so on). 
As you assign your own names to the sheets, the tabs appear either longer 
or shorter, depending on the length of the sheet tab name. Just keep in mind 
that the longer the sheet tabs, the fewer you can see at one time, and the 
more sheet tab scrolling you’ll have to do to find the worksheet you want. 
To rename a worksheet, you take these steps:
 
1. Press Ctrl+PgDn until the sheet you want to rename is active, or click 
its sheet tab if it’s displayed at the bottom of the workbook window.
 
 Don’t forget that you have to select and activate the sheet you want to 
rename, or you end up renaming whatever sheet happens to be current 
at the time you perform the next step.
 
2. Click Rename Sheet on the Format button’s drop-down menu on the 
Home tab, press Alt+HOR, or right-click the sheet tab and then click 
Rename on its shortcut menu.

250
Reorganizing the Workbook
 
 When you choose this command, Excel selects the current name of the 
tab and positions the insertion point at the end of the name.
 
3. Replace or edit the name on the sheet tab and then press the Enter 
key.
When you rename a worksheet in this manner, keep in mind that Excel then 
uses that sheet name in any formulas that refer to cells in that worksheet. 
So, for instance, if you rename Sheet2 to 2010 Sales and then create a for-
mula in cell A10 of Sheet1 that adds its cell B10 to cell C34 in Sheet2, the for-
mula in cell A10 becomes:
=B10+’2010 Sales’!C34
This is in place of the more obscure =B10+Sheet2!C34. For this reason, keep 
your sheet names short and to the point so that you can easily and quickly 
identify the sheet and its data without creating excessively long formula ref-
erences.
Designer sheets
Excel 2010 makes it easy to color-code the worksheets in your workbook. 
This makes it possible to create a color scheme that helps either identify or 
prioritize the sheets and the information they contain (as you might with dif-
ferent colored folder tabs in a filing cabinet).
 
When you color a sheet tab, note that the tab appears in that color only 
when it’s not the active sheet. The moment you select a color-coded sheet 
tab, it becomes white with just a bar of the assigned color appearing under 
the sheet name. Note, too, that when you assign darker colors to a sheet 
tab, Excel automatically reverses out the sheet name text to white when the 
worksheet is not active.
Color coding sheet tabs
To assign a new color to a sheet tab, follow these three steps:
 
1. Press Ctrl+PgDn until the sheet whose tab you want to color is active, 
or click its sheet tab if it’s displayed at the bottom of the workbook 
window.
 
 Don’t forget that you have to select and activate the sheet whose tab 
you want to color, or you end up coloring the tab of whatever sheet hap-

2. Click the Format button on the Home tab and then highlight Tab 
Color, press Alt+HOT, or right-click the tab and then highlight Tab 
Color on the shortcut menu to display its pop-up color palette.

you want to assign to the current sheet tab.

To remove color-coding from a sheet tab, click the No Color option at the 
bottom of the pop-up color palette (Alt+HOT) after selecting it to make the 
worksheet active.
Assigning a graphic image as the sheet background
If coloring the sheet tabs isn’t enough for you, you can also assign a graphic 
image to be used as the background for all the cells in the entire worksheet. 
Just be aware that the background image must either be very light in color 
or use a greatly reduced opacity in order for your worksheet data to be read 
over the image. This probably makes most graphics that you have readily 
available unusable as worksheet background images. It can, however, be 
quite effective if you have a special corporate watermark graphic (as with 
the company’s logo at extremely low opacity) that adds just a hint of a back-
ground without obscuring the data being presented in its cells.
To add a graphic file as the background for your worksheet, take these 
steps:
 
1. Press Ctrl+PgDn until the sheet to which you want to assign the 
graphic as the background is active, or click its sheet tab if it’s dis-
played at the bottom of the workbook window.
 
 Don’t forget that you have to select and activate the sheet to which the 
graphic file will act as the background, or you end up assigning the file 
to whatever sheet happens to be current at the time you perform the fol-
lowing steps.
 
2. Click the Background command button in the Page Setup group of the 
Page Layout tab or press Alt+PSB.
 
 Doing this opens the Sheet Background dialog box, where you select the 
graphics file whose image is to become the worksheet background.
 
3. Open the folder that contains the image you want to use and then 
click its graphic file icon before you click the Insert button.
 
 As soon as you click the Insert button, Excel closes the Sheet 
Background dialog box, and the image in the selected file becomes 
the background image for all cells in the current worksheet. (Usually, 
the program does this by stretching the graphic so that it takes up all 
the cells that are visible in the Workbook window. In the case of some 
smaller images, the program does this by tiling the image so that it’s 
duplicated across and down the viewing area.)
 
Keep in mind that a graphic image that you assign as the worksheet back-
ground doesn’t appear in the printout, unlike the pattern and background 
colors that you assign to ranges of cells in the sheet.
To remove a background image, you simply click the Delete Background 
command button on the Page Layout tab of the Ribbon (which replaces the 

252
Reorganizing the Workbook
Background button the moment you assign a background image to a work-
sheet) or press Alt+PSB again, and Excel immediately clears the image from 
the entire worksheet.
Adding and deleting sheets
Although you only start out with three worksheets, you can have as many 
worksheets as you need in building and remodeling your spreadsheet. To 
add a new worksheet, click the Insert Worksheet button, which always 
appears on its own tab immediately after the last sheet tab in the workbook.
Excel then inserts a new sheet at the back of the existing sheets in the work-
book (and immediately in front of the tab with the Insert Worksheet button), 
and the program assigns it the next available sheet number (as in Sheet4, 
Sheet5, Sheet6, and so on).
 
You can also insert a new sheet (and not necessarily a blank worksheet) into 
the workbook by right-clicking a sheet tab and then clicking Insert at the 
top of the tab’s shortcut menu. Excel opens the Insert dialog box containing 
different file icons that you can select — Chart, MS Excel 4.0 Macro, and MS 
Excel 5.0 Dialog, along with a variety of different worksheet templates — to 
insert a specialized chart sheet (see Book V, Chapter 1), macro sheet (Book 
VIII, Chapter 1), or worksheet following a template design (Book II, Chapter 
1). Note that when you insert a new sheet using the Insert dialog box, Excel 
inserts the new worksheet, chart sheet, or macro sheet in front of the sheet 
that’s active (and not at the end of the workbook as when you insert a work-
sheet by clicking the Insert Worksheet button).
 
If you find that three worksheets just never seem to be enough for the kind 
of spreadsheets you normally create, you can change the default number 
of sheets that are automatically available in all new workbook files that 
you open. To do this, open the General tab of the Excel Options dialog box 
(File➪Options or Alt+FI), and then enter a number in the Include This Many 
Sheets text box or select the number with the spinner buttons (up to a maxi-
mum of 255 — that’s a lotta sheets!). Of course, if you find that three sheets 
are always too much (because you only use one), you can reduce the default 
number from three by entering 1 or 2 in this text box. (You can’t go lower 
than 1 because a workbook with no worksheet is no workbook at all.)
To remove a worksheet, make the sheet active and then click the drop-down 
button attached to the Delete button on the Home tab of the Ribbon and 
click Delete Sheet on its drop-down menu — you can press Alt+HDS or right-
click its tab and then click Delete on its shortcut menu. If Excel detects that 
the worksheet contains some data, the program then displays an alert dialog 
box cautioning you that data may exist in the worksheet you’re just about 
to zap. To go ahead and delete the sheet (data and all), you click the Delete 
button. To preserve the worksheet, click Cancel or press the Escape key.

Book II
Chapter 4
Managing
Worksheets
253
Reorganizing the Workbook
 
Deleting a sheet is one of those actions that you can’t undo with the Undo 
button on the Quick Access toolbar. This means that after you click the 
Delete button, you’ve kissed your worksheet goodbye, so please don’t do 
this unless you’re certain that you aren’t dumping needed data. Also, keep in 
mind that you can’t delete a worksheet if that sheet is the only one in the 
workbook until you’ve inserted another blank worksheet: Excel won’t allow a 
workbook file to be completely sheetless.
Changing the sheets
Excel makes it easy to rearrange the order of the sheets in your workbook. 
To move a sheet, click its sheet tab and drag it to the new position in the 
row of tabs. As you drag, the pointer changes shape to an arrowhead on a 
dog-eared piece of paper, and you see a black triangle pointing downward 
above the sheet tabs. When this triangle is positioned over the tab of the 
sheet that is to follow the one you’re moving, release the mouse button.
If you need to copy a worksheet to another position in the workbook, hold 
down the Ctrl key as you click and drag the sheet tab. When you release the 
mouse button, Excel creates a copy with a new sheet tab name based on the 
number of the copy and the original sheet name. For example, if you copy 
Sheet1 to a new place in the workbook, the copy is renamed Sheet1 (2). You 
can then rename the worksheet whatever you want.
Group editing
One of the nice things about a workbook is that it enables you to edit more 
than one worksheet at a time. Of course, you should be concerned with 
group editing only when you’re working on a bunch of worksheets that share 
essentially the same layout and require the same type of formatting.
For example, suppose that you have a workbook that contains annual sales 
worksheets (named YTD04, YTD05, and YTD06) for three consecutive years. 
The worksheets share the same layout (with months across the columns and 
quarterly and annual totals, locations, and types of sales down the rows) but 
lack standard formatting.
To format any part of these three worksheets in a single operation, you 
simply resort to group editing, which requires selecting the three sales 
worksheets. Simply click the YTD04, YTD05, and YTD06 sheet tabs as you 
hold down the Ctrl key, or you can click the YTD04 tab and then hold down 
the Shift key as you click the YTD06 tab.
After you select the last sheet, the message [Group] appears in the title bar 
of the active document window (with the YTD04 worksheet, in this case).
The [Group] indicator lets you know that any editing change you make to 
the current worksheet will affect all the sheets that are currently selected. 

254
Reorganizing the Workbook
For example, if you select a row of column headings and add bold and italics 
to the headings in the current worksheet, the same formatting is applied to 
the same cell selection in all three sales sheets. All headings in the same cell 
range in the other worksheets are now in bold and italics. Keep in mind that 
you can apply not only formatting changes to a cell range, but also editing 
changes, such as replacing a cell entry, deleting a cell’s contents, or moving 
a cell selection to a new place in the worksheet. These changes also affect all 
the worksheets you have selected as long as they’re grouped together.
After you are finished making editing changes that affect all the grouped 
worksheets, you can break up the group by right-clicking one of the sheet 
tabs and then clicking Ungroup Sheets at the top of the shortcut menu. As 
soon as you break up the group, the [Group] indicator disappears from the 
title bar, and thereafter, any editing changes that you make affect only the 
cells in the active worksheet.
 
To select all the worksheets in the workbook for group editing in one opera-
tion, right-click the tab of the sheet where you want to make the editing 
changes that affect all the other sheets, and then click Select All Sheets on 
its shortcut menu.
“Now you see them; now you don’t”
Another technique that comes in handy when working with multiple work-
sheets is hiding particular worksheets in the workbook. Just as you can hide 
particular columns, rows, and cell ranges in a worksheet, you can also hide 
particular worksheets in the workbook. For example, you may want to hide a 
worksheet that contains sensitive (for-your-eyes-only) material, such as the 
one with all the employee salaries in the company or the one that contains 
all the macros used in the workbook.
As with hiding columns and rows, hiding worksheets enables you to print 
the contents of the workbook without the data in worksheets that you con-
sider either unnecessary in the report or too classified for widespread distri-
bution, but which, nonetheless, are required in the workbook. Then after the 
report is printed, you can redisplay the worksheets by unhiding them.
To hide a worksheet, make it active by selecting its sheet tab, then click the 
Format command button on the Home tab of the Ribbon and highlight the 
Hide & Unhide option on its drop-down menu, and then click Hide Sheet on 
its continuation menu (or press Alt+HOUS). Excel removes this sheet’s tab 
from the row of sheet tabs, making it impossible for anyone to select and dis-
play the worksheet in the document window.
To redisplay any of the sheets you’ve hidden, click the Format command 
button on the Home tab and highlight the Hide & Unhide option on its drop-
down menu and then click Unhide Sheet on its continuation menu (or press 
Alt+HOUH) to display the Unhide dialog box.

Book II
Chapter 4
Managing
Worksheets
255
Reorganizing the Workbook
In the Unhide Sheet list box, click the name of the sheet that you want to 
display once again in the workbook. As soon as you click OK, Excel redis-
plays the sheet tab of the previously hidden worksheet — as simple as that! 
Unfortunately, although you can hide multiple worksheets in one hide opera-
tion, you can select only one sheet at a time to redisplay with the Unhide 
command.
Opening windows on different sheets
The biggest problem with keeping your spreadsheet data on different work-
sheets rather than keeping it all together on the same sheet is being able 
to compare the information on the different sheets. When you use a single 
worksheet, you can split the workbook window into horizontal or vertical 
panes and then scroll different sections of the sheet into view. The only way 
to do this when the spreadsheet data are located on different worksheets is 
to open a second window on a second worksheet and then arrange the win-
dows with the different worksheets so that data from both desired regions 
are displayed on the screen. The easiest way to do this is to use Excel’s View 
Side by Side command to tile the windows one above the other and auto-
matically synchronize the scrolling between them.
Comparing worksheet windows side by side
Figure 4-11 helps illustrate how the View Side by Side feature works. This 
figure contains two windows showing parts of two different worksheets 
(2003 Sales and 2004 Sales) in the same workbook (CG Media Sales - 03-05.
xlsx). These windows are arranged horizontally so that they fit one above 
the other. The top window shows the upper-left portion of the first work-
sheet with the 2003 sales data, while the lower window shows the upper-left 
portion of the second worksheet with the 2004 sales data. Note that both 
windows contain the same sheet tabs (although different tabs are active 
in the different windows) but that only the top, active window is equipped 
with a set of horizontal and vertical scroll bars. However, because Excel 
automatically synchronizes the scrolling between the windows, you can use 
the single set of scroll bars to bring different sections of the two sheets into 
view.
Here is the procedure I followed to create and arrange these windows in the 
CG Media Sales 03-05.xlsx workbook:
 
1. Open the workbook file for editing and then create a new window 
by clicking the New Window command button on the View tab of the 
Ribbon — you can also do this by pressing Alt+WN.
 
 Excel appends the number 2 to the workbook’s filename displayed at the 
top of the screen (as in CG Media Sales – 03-05.xlsx:2) to indicate that a 
new window has been added to the workbook.

2. Arrange the windows one on top of the other by clicking the View 
Side by Side command button (the one with the pages side by side to 
the immediate right of the Split button) in the Window group of the 
View tab or by pressing Alt+WB.
 
3. Click the lower window (indicated by the “:1” after the filename on its 
title bar) to activate the window and then click the 2004 Sales sheet 
tab to activate it.
 
4. Click the upper window (indicated by the “:2” following the filename 
on its title bar) to activate the window.
Immediately below the View Side by Side command button in the Windows 
group on the View tab of the Ribbon, you find these two command buttons:
 
✦ Synchronous Scrolling: When this button is selected, any scrolling that 
you do in the worksheet in the active window is mirrored and synchro-
nized in the worksheet in the inactive window beneath it. To be able to 
scroll the worksheet in the active window independently of the inactive 
window, click the Synchronous Scrolling button to deactivate it.
 
✦ Reset Window Position: Click this button if you manually resize the 
active window (by dragging its size box) and then want to restore the 
two windows to their previous side-by-side arrangement.
To remove the side-by-side windows, click the View Side by Side command 
button again or press Alt+WB. Excel returns the windows to the display 

Book II

257
Reorganizing the Workbook
arrangement selected (see “Window arrangements” that follows for details) 
before clicking the View Side by Side command button the first time. If you 
haven’t previously selected a display option in the Arrange Windows dialog 
box, Excel displays the active window full size.
 
Note that you can use the View Side by Side feature when you have more 
than two windows open on a single workbook. When three or more windows 
are open at the time you click the View Side by Side command button, Excel 
opens the Compare Side by Side dialog box. This dialog box displays a list 
of all the other open windows with which you can compare the active one. 
When you click the name of this window and click OK in the Compare Side 
by Side dialog box, Excel places the active window above the one you just 
selected (using the arrangement shown in Figure 4-11).
Note, too, that you can use Excel’s View Side by Side feature to compare 
worksheets in different workbooks just as well as different sheets in the 
same workbook (see “Comparing windows on different workbooks” later in 
this chapter).
Window arrangements
After creating one or more additional windows for a workbook (by click-
ing the New Window command button on the View tab), you can then vary 
their arrangement by selecting different arrangement options in the Arrange 
Windows dialog box, opened by clicking the Arrange All button on the View 
tab (or by pressing Alt+WA). The Arrange Windows dialog box contains the 
following four Arrange options:
 
✦ Tiled: Select this option button to have Excel arrange and size the win-
dows so that they all fit side by side on the screen in the order in which 
you open them (when only two windows are open, selecting the Tiled or 
Vertical option results in the same side-by-side arrangement).
 
✦ Horizontal: Select this option button to have Excel size the windows 
equally and then place them one above the other (this is the default 
arrangement option that Excel uses when you click the View Side by 
Side command button).
 
✦ Vertical: Select this option button to have Excel size the windows 
equally and then place them next to one other, vertically from left to 
right.
 
✦ Cascade: Select this option button to have Excel arrange and size the win-
dows so that they overlap one another with only their title bars visible.
After arranging your windows, you can then select different sheets to display 
in either window by clicking their sheet tabs, and you can select different 
parts of the sheet to display by using the window’s scroll bars.

258
Working with Multiple Workbooks
 
To activate different windows on the workbook so that you can activate a 
different worksheet by selecting its sheet tab and/or use the scroll bars to 
bring new data into view, click the window’s title bar or press Ctrl+F6 until 
its title bar is selected.
When you want to resume normal, full-screen viewing in the workbook 
window, click the Maximize button in one of the windows. To get rid of 
a second window, click its button on the taskbar and then click its Close 
Window button on the far right side of the menu bar (the one with the X). 
(Be sure that you don’t click the Close button on the far-right of the Excel 
title bar, because doing this closes your workbook file and exits you from 
Excel!)
Working with Multiple Workbooks
Working with more than one worksheet in a single workbook is bad enough, 
but working with worksheets in different workbooks can be really wicked. 
The key to doing this successfully is just keeping track of “who’s on first”; 
you do this by opening and using windows on the individual workbook files 
you have open.
With the different workbook windows in place, you can then compare the 
data in different workbooks, use the drag-and-drop method to copy or move 
data between workbooks, or even copy or move entire worksheets.
Comparing windows on different workbooks
To work with sheets from different workbook files you have open, you manu-
ally arrange their workbook windows in the Excel Work area, or you click 
the View Side by Side command button on the View tab of the Ribbon or 
press Alt+WB. If you have only two workbooks open when you do this, Excel 
places the active workbook that you last opened above the one that opened 
earlier (with their active worksheets displayed). If you have more than two 
workbooks open, Excel displays the Compare Side by Side dialog box where 
you click the name of the workbook that you want to compare with the 
active one.
 
If you need to compare more than two workbooks on the same screen, 
instead of clicking the View Side by Side button on the View tab, you click 
the Arrange All button and then select the desired Arrange option (Tiled, 
Horizontal, Vertical, or Cascading) in the Arrange Windows dialog box. Just 
make sure when selecting this option that the Windows of Active Workbook 
check box is not selected in the Arrange Windows dialog box.
Transferring data between open windows
After the windows on your different workbooks are arranged on-screen the 
way you want them, you can compare or transfer information between them. 

Book II
Chapter 4
Managing
Worksheets
259
Working with Multiple Workbooks
To compare data in different workbooks, you switch between the different 
windows, activating and bringing the regions of the different worksheets you 
want to compare into view.
To move data between workbook windows, arrange the worksheets in these 
windows so that both the cells with the data entries you want to move and 
the cell range into which you want to move them are both displayed in 
their respective windows. Then, select the cell selection to be moved, drag 
it to the other worksheet window, to first cell of the range where it is to be 
moved to, and release the mouse button. To copy data between workbooks, 
you follow the exact same procedure, except that you hold down the Ctrl 
key as you drag the selected range from one window to another. (See Book 
II, Chapter 3 for information on using drag-and-drop to copy and move data 
entries.)
 
When you’re finished working with workbook windows arranged in some 
manner in the Excel Work area, you can return to the normal full-screen view 
by clicking the Maximize button on one of the windows. As soon as you max-
imize one workbook window, all the rest of the arranged workbook windows 
are made full size as well. If you used the View Side by Side feature to set up 
the windows, you can do this by clicking the View Side by Side command 
button on the View tab again or by pressing Alt+WB.
Transferring sheets from one workbook to another
Instead of copying cell ranges from one workbook to another, you can move 
(or copy) entire worksheets between workbooks. You can do this with drag-
and-drop or by using the Move or Copy Sheet option on the Format com-
mand button’s drop-down menu on the Ribbon’s Home tab.
To use drag-and-drop to move a sheet between open windows, you simply 
drag its sheet tab from its window to the place on the sheet tabs in the 
other window where the sheet is to be moved to. As soon as you release the 
mouse button, the entire worksheet is moved from one file to the other, and 
its sheet tab now appears among the others in that workbook. To copy a 
sheet rather than move it, you perform the same procedure, except that you 
hold down the Ctrl key as you drag the sheet tab from one window to the 
next.
To use the Move or Copy Sheet option on the Format command button’s 
drop-down menu to move or copy entire worksheets, you follow these steps:
 
1. Open both the workbook containing the sheets to be moved or copied 
and the workbook where the sheets will be moved or copied to.
 
 Both the source and destination workbooks must be open in order to 
copy or move sheets between them.

260
Working with Multiple Workbooks
 
2. Click the workbook window with sheets to be moved or copied.
 
 Doing this activates the source workbook so that you can select the 
sheet or sheets you want to move or copy.
 
3. Select the sheet tab of the worksheet or worksheets to be moved or 
copied.
 
 To select more than one worksheet, hold down the Ctrl key as you click 
the individual sheet tabs.
 
4. Click the Format button on the Home tab and then click Move or Copy 
Sheet on the drop-down menu or press Alt+HOM.
 
 Doing this opens the Move or Copy dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-12.
 
5. Click the filename of the workbook into which the selected sheets are 
to be moved or copied in the To Book drop-down menu.
 
 If you want to move or copy the selected worksheets into a new work-
book file, click the (New Book) item at the very top of this drop-down 
menu.
 
6. Click the name of the sheet that should immediately follow the 
sheet(s) that you’re about to move or copy into this workbook in the 
Before Sheet list box.
 
 If you want to move or copy the selected sheet(s) to the very end of the 
destination workbook, click (Move to End) at the bottom of this list box.
 
7. If you want to copy the selected sheet(s) rather than move them, click 
the Create a Copy check box.
 
 If you don’t select this check box, Excel automatically moves the 
selected sheet(s) from one workbook to the other instead of copying 
them.
 
8. Click OK to close the Move or Copy dialog box and complete the move 
or copy operation.

Working with Multiple Workbooks
Saving a workspace
Excel’s Workspace feature enables you to save the window arrangement that 
you’ve set up in a special workspace file (given the filename extension .xlw, 
which stands for Excel workspace). In a workspace file, Excel saves all the 
information about the open workbooks, including the window arrangement, 
magnification settings, and display settings. (The workspace file also saves 
the print areas defined in the open workbooks — see Book II, Chapter 5, for 
information on printing.)
 
Workspace files contain only such information about the open workbooks, 
not the actual workbook files. Therefore, you can’t send a workspace file to a 
coworker and expect him or her to be able to successfully open the file with-
out also sending the associated workbook files.
To save a workspace, you take the following steps:
 
1. Open all the workbooks you want opened when you open the work-
space file.
 
2. Arrange the windows for these workbooks as you want them to 
appear when you first open the workspace file.
 
 To arrange the windows, click the Arrange All button on the View tab 
and then select the type of arrangement in the Arrange Windows dialog 
box (be sure that the Windows of Active Workbook check box is not 
selected).
 
3. Select any display settings and magnification settings that you want 
used in the individual workbook windows when you first open the 
workspace file.
 
 To change the display settings for a workbook, activate its window 
and then change the settings on the Advanced tab of the Excel Options 
dialog box (Alt+FIA). To change the magnification, use the Zoom slider 
on the Status bar.
 
4. Click the Save Workspace command button on the View tab of the 
Ribbon or press Alt+WK.
 
 Doing this opens the Save Workspace dialog box, which is just like the 
Save As dialog box, except that Workspaces (*.xlw) is selected as the 
default file type in the Save as Type combo box.
 
5. Select the folder in which you want the workspace file saved in the 
Save In drop-down list box and then edit the desired filename in the 
File Name combo box.
 
 If you want the workspace file to open automatically each time you start 
Excel, save the file in the XLStart folder in your Office 2010 folder. This 
folder is located within the Microsoft Office folder, inside the Programs 
Folder on your hard drive (usually the C: drive).

262
Consolidating Worksheets
 
6. Click the Save button to save the workspace and to close the Save 
Workspace dialog box.
After saving your workspace file, you can then open it as you would any 
other Excel workbook or template file: Choose File➪Open, open the folder 
with the .xlw file you want to use, click its file icon, and then click the Open 
button. (See Book II, Chapter 3 for details on opening Excel files.)
Consolidating Worksheets
Excel allows you to consolidate data from different worksheets into a single 
worksheet. Using the program’s Consolidate command button on the Data 
tab of the Ribbon, you can easily combine data from multiple spreadsheets. 
For example, you can use the Consolidate command to total all budget 
spreadsheets prepared by each department in the company or to create 
summary totals for income statements for a period of several years. If 
you used a template to create each worksheet you’re consolidating, or an 
identical layout, Excel can quickly consolidate the values by virtue of their 
common position in their respective worksheets. However, even when the 
data entries are laid out differently in each spreadsheet, Excel can still con-
solidate them provided that you’ve used the same labels to describe the 
data entries in their respective worksheets.
Most of the time, you want to total the data that you’re consolidating from 
the various worksheets. By default, Excel uses the SUM function to total all 
the cells in the worksheets that share the same cell references (when you 
consolidate by position) or that use the same labels (when you consolidate 
by category). You can, however, have Excel use any of other following sta-
tistical functions when doing a consolidation: AVERAGE, COUNT, COUNTA, 
MAX, MIN, PRODUCT, STDEV, STDEVP, VAR, or VARP (see Book III, Chapter 
5 for more information on these functions).
To begin consolidating the sheets in the same workbook, you select a new 
worksheet to hold the consolidated data (if need be, insert a new sheet in 
the workbook by clicking the Insert Worksheet button). To begin consolidat-
ing sheets in different workbooks, open a new workbook. If the sheets in the 
various workbooks are generated from a template, open the new workbook 
for the consolidated data from that template.
Before you begin the consolidation process on the new worksheet, you 
choose the cell or cell range in this worksheet where the consolidated data 
is to appear (this range is called the destination area). If you select a single 
cell, Excel expands the destination area to columns to the right and rows 
below as needed to accommodate the consolidated data. If you select a 
single row, the program expands the destination area down subsequent 
rows of the worksheet, if required to accommodate the data. If you select 

Book II
Chapter 4
Managing
Worksheets
263
Consolidating Worksheets
a single column, Excel expands the destination area across columns to 
the right, if required to accommodate the data. If, however, you select a 
multi-cell range as the destination area, the program does not expand the 
destination area and restricts the consolidated data just to the cell selection.
 
If you want Excel to use a particular range in the worksheet for all consolida-
tions you perform in a worksheet, assign the range name Consolidate_Area 
to this cell range. Excel then consolidates data into this range whenever you 
use the Consolidate command.
When consolidating data, you can select data in sheets in workbooks that 
you’ve opened in Excel or in sheets in unopened workbooks stored on disk. 
The cells that you specify for consolidation are referred to as the source 
area, and the worksheets that contain the source areas are known as the 
source worksheets.
If the source worksheets are open in Excel, you can specify the references 
of the source areas by pointing to the cell references (even when the 
Consolidate dialog box is open, Excel will allow you to activate different 
worksheets and scroll through them as you select the cell references for the 
source area). If the source worksheets are not open in Excel, you must type 
in the cell references as external references, following the same guidelines 
you use when typing a linking formula with an external reference (except 
that you don’t type =). For example, to specify the data in range B4:R21 on 
Sheet1 in a workbook named CG Media - 2010 Sales.xlsx as a source area, 
you enter the following external reference:
‘[CG Media – 2010 Sales.xlsx]Sheet1’!$b$4:$r$21
Note that if you want to consolidate the same data range in all the work-
sheets that use a similar filename (for example, CG Media - 2000 Sales, CG 
Media - 2001 Sales, CG Media - 2002 Sales, and so on), you can use the aster-
isk (*) or the question mark (?) as wildcard characters to stand for missing 
characters as in
‘[CG Media - 20?? Sales.xlsx]Sheet1’!$b$4:$r$21
In this example, Excel consolidates the range A2:R21 in Sheet1 of all versions 
of the workbooks that use “CG - Media - 20” in the main file when this name 
is followed by another two characters (be they 00, 01, 02, 03, and so on).
When you consolidate data, Excel uses only the cells in the source areas 
that contain values. If the cells contain formulas, Excel uses their calculated 
values, but if the cells contain text, Excel ignores them and treats them as 
though they were blank (except in the case of category labels when you’re 
consolidating your data by category as described later in this chapter).

Consolidating Worksheets
Consolidating by position
You consolidate worksheets by position when they use the same layout 
(such as those created from a template). When you consolidate data by 
position, Excel does not copy the labels from the source areas to the desti-
nation area, only values. To consolidate worksheets by position, you follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open all the workbooks with the worksheets you want to consolidate. 
If the sheets are all in one workbook, open it in Excel.
 
 Now you need to activate a new worksheet to hold the consolidated 
data. If you’re consolidating the data in a new workbook, you need to 
open it (File➪New or Alt+FN). If you’re consolidating worksheets gener-
ated from a template, use the template to create the new workbook in 
which you are to consolidate the spreadsheet data.
 
2. Open a new worksheet to hold the consolidated data.
 
 Next, you need to select the destination area in the new worksheet that 
is to hold the consolidated data.
 
3. Click the cell at the beginning of the destination area in the consolida-
tion worksheet, or select the cell range if you want to limit the desti-
nation area to a particular region.
 
 If you want Excel to expand the size of the destination area as needed to 
accommodate the source areas, just select the first cell of this range.
 
4. Click the Consolidate command button on the Data tab of the Ribbon 
or press Alt+AN.
 
 Doing this opens the Consolidate dialog box similar to the one shown in 
Figure 4-13. By default, Excel uses the SUM function to total the values in 
the source areas. If you want to use another statistical function such as 
AVERAGE or COUNT, select the desired function in the Function drop-
down list box.
 
5. (Optional) Click the function you want to use in the Function drop-
down list box if you don’t want the values in the source areas summed 
together.
 
 Now, you need to specify the various source ranges to be consolidated 
and add them to the All References list box in the Consolidate dialog 
box. To do this, you specify each range to be used as the source data in 
the Reference text box and then click the Add button to add it to the All 
References list box.
 
6. Select the cell range or type the cell references for the first source 
area in the Reference text box.

Consolidating Worksheets
 
 When you select the cell range by pointing, Excel minimizes the 
Consolidate dialog box to the Reference text box so that you can see 
what you’re selecting. If the workbook window is not visible, choose it 
from the Switch Windows button on the View tab or the Windows task-
bar and then select the cell selection as you normally would (remem-
ber that you can move the Consolidate dialog box minimized to the 
Reference text box by dragging it by the title bar).
 
 If the source worksheets are not open, you can click the Browse com-
mand button to select the filename in the Browse dialog box to enter it 
(plus an exclamation point) into the Reference text box, and then you 
can type in the range name or cell references you want to use. If you 
prefer, you can type in the entire cell reference including the filename. 
Remember that you can use the asterisk (*) and question mark (?) wild-
card characters when typing in the references for the source area.
 
7. Click the Add command button to add this reference to the first 
source area to the All References list box.
 
8. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 until you have added all the references for all 
the source areas that you want to consolidate.
 
9. Click the OK button in the Consolidate dialog box.
 
 Excel closes the Consolidate dialog box and then consolidates all the 
values in the source areas in the place in the active worksheet desig-
nated as the destination area. Note that you can click the Undo button 
on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z to undo the effects of a con-
solidation if you find that you defined the destination and/or the source 
areas incorrectly.

sales. These sales figures are consolidated in the destination area, B4:R21, 
in the Consolidated sheet in the CG Media - 2008-10 Consolidated Sales.xls 
workbook (however, because all these worksheets use the same layout, only 
cell B4, the first cell in this range, was designated at the destination area).

Excel allows only one consolidation per worksheet at one time. You can, 
however, add to or remove source areas and repeat a consolidation. To add 
new source areas, open the Consolidate dialog box, and then specify the cell 
references in the Reference text box and click the Add button. To remove a 
source area, click its references in the All References list box and then click 
the Delete button. To perform the consolidation with the new source areas, 
click OK. To perform a second consolidation in the same worksheet, choose 
a new destination area, open the Consolidate dialog box, clear all the source 
areas you don’t want to use in the All References list box with the Delete 
button, and then redefine all the new source areas in the Reference text box 
with the Add button before you perform the consolidation by clicking the 
OK button.

Consolidating Worksheets
Consolidating by category
You consolidate worksheets by category when their source areas do not 
share the same cell coordinates in their respective worksheets, but 
their data entries do use common column and/or row labels. When you 
consolidate by category, you include these identifying labels as part of the 
source areas. Unlike when consolidating by position, Excel copies the row 
labels and/or column labels when you specify that they should be used in 
the consolidation.
When consolidating spreadsheet data by category, you must specify 
whether to use the top row of column labels and/or the left column of row 
labels in determining which data to consolidate. To use the top row of 
column labels, you click the Top Row check box in the Use Labels In sec-
tion of the Consolidate dialog box. To use the left column of row labels, you 
click the Left Column check box in this area. Then, after you’ve specified 
all the source areas (including the cells that contain these column and row 
labels), you perform the consolidation in the destination area by clicking the 
Consolidate dialog box’s OK button.
Linking consolidated data
Excel allows you to link the data in the source areas to the destination area 
during a consolidation. That way, any changes that you make to the values 
in the source area are automatically updated in the destination area of the 
consolidation worksheet. To create links between the source worksheets 
and the destination worksheet, you simply click the Create Links to Source 
Data check box in the Consolidate dialog box to put a check mark in it when 
defining the settings for the upcoming consolidation.
When you perform a consolidation with linking, Excel creates the links 
between the source areas and the destination area by outlining the destina-
tion area (see “Outlining worksheets” earlier in this chapter for details). 
Each outline level created in the destination area holds rows or columns 
that contain the linking formulas to the consolidated data.
Figure 4-15 shows an outline created during consolidation after expanding 
only the level of the outline showing the consolidation of the Rock music CD 
sales. Here, you can see that during consolidation, Excel created three detail 
rows for each of the three years of sales (2008, 2009, and 2010) used in the 
linked consolidation. These rows contain the external reference formulas 
that link to the source data. For example, the formula in cell B4 contains the 
following formula:
=’[CG Media - 2008 Sales.xlsx]Sales08’!$B$4

268
Consolidating Worksheets
This formula links the value in cell B4 in the Sales 08 sheet of the CG Media - 
2008 Sales.xlsx workbook. If you change this value in that worksheet, the new 
value is automatically updated in cell B4 in the CG Media - 2008-10 Consolidated 
Sales.xlsx workbook, which, in turn, changes the subtotal for the January Rock 
music CD sales in cell B6.

✓ Quick Printing from the Quick Access toolbar
✓ Printing all the worksheets in a workbook
✓ Printing just some of the cells in a worksheet
✓ Changing page orientation
✓ Printing the whole worksheet on a single page

P
rinting the spreadsheet is one of the most important tasks that you do 
in Excel (second only to saving your spreadsheet in the first place). 
Fortunately, Excel makes it easy to produce professional-looking reports 
from your worksheets. This chapter covers how to select the printer that 
you want to use; print all or just selected parts of the worksheet; change 
your page layout and Print, including the orientation, paper size, print qual-
ity, number of copies, and range of pages all from the new Excel Backstage 
View. The chapter also enlightens you on how to use the Ribbon to set 
up reports using the correct margin settings, headers and footers, titles, 
and page breaks and use the Page Layout, Print Preview, and Page Break 
Preview features to make sure that the pages of your report are the way you 
want them to appear before you print them.
The printing techniques covered in this chapter focus primarily on printing 
the data in your spreadsheets. Of course in Excel, you can also print your 
charts in chart sheets. Not surprisingly, you will find that most of the print-
ing techniques that you learn for printing worksheet data in this chapter 
also apply to printing charts in their respective sheets. (For specific infor-
mation on printing charts, see Book V, Chapter 1.)

Printing from the Excel Backstage View
Printing from the Excel Backstage View
The new Backstage View in Excel 2010 contains a Print panel (shown in 
Figure 5-1) opened by clicking File➪Print or pressing Ctrl+P. This Print panel 
in the Excel Backstage View enables you to do any of the following:
 
✦ Change the number of spreadsheet report copies to be printed (1 copy 
is the default) by entering a new value in the Number of Copies combo 
box.
 
✦ Select a new printer to use in printing the spreadsheet report in the 
Printer drop-down list box (see “Selecting the printer to use” that fol-
lows for details).
 
✦ Change what part of the spreadsheet is printed in the report by selecting 
a new preset in the Active Sheets button’s drop-down — you can choose 
between Print Active Sheets (the default), Print Entire Workbook, or 
Print Selection — or by entering a new value in the Pages combo boxes 
immediate below. Select the Ignore Print Area check box at the bottom 
of the Active Sheets button’s drop-down menu when you want one of the 
other Print What options (Active Sheets, Entire Workbook, or Selection) 
that you selected to be used in the printing rather than the Print Area 
you previously defined (see the “Setting and clearing the Print Area” sec-
tion later in this chapter for details on how to set this area).
 
✦ Print on both sides of the paper (assuming that your printer is capable 
of double-sided printing) by selecting either Print on Both Sides, Flip 
Pages on Top or the Print on Both Sides, Flip Pages on Side on the Print 
One-Sided button’s drop-down menu.
 
✦ Print multiple copies of the spreadsheet report without having your 
printer collate the pages of each copy (collating the copies is the 
default) by selecting the Uncollated option on the Collated button’s 
drop-down menu.
 
✦ Change the orientation of the printing on the paper from the default por-
trait orientation to landscape (so that more columns of data and fewer 
rows are printed on each page of the report) by selecting the Landscape 
Orientation option on the Page Orientation button’s drop-down menu.
 
✦ Change the paper size from 8.5 x 11 inches letter to another paper size 
supported by your printer by selecting its option on the Page Size but-
ton’s drop-down menu.
 
✦ Change the margins from the default normal margins to Wide, Narrow, 
or the Last Custom Setting (representing the margin settings you last 
manually set for the report) by selecting these presets on the Margins 
button’s drop-down menu (see “Massaging the margins” later in this 
chapter for details).
 
✦ Change the default settings used by your printer by using the options in 
the particular printer’s Options dialog box (these settings can include 
the print quality and color versus black and white or grayscale,

depending upon the type of printer). Open it by clicking the Printer 
Properties link right under the name of your printer in the Print panel.
 
✦ Preview the pages of the spreadsheet report on the right side of the Print 
panel (see “Previewing the printout” later in this chapter for details).

Selecting the printer to use
Windows allows you to install more than one printer for use with your appli-
cations. If you’ve installed multiple printers, the first one installed becomes 
the default printer, which is used by all Windows applications, includ-
ing Excel 2010. If you get a new printer, you must first install it from the 
Windows Control Panel before you can select and use the printer in Excel.
To select a new printer to use in printing the current worksheet, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open the workbook with the worksheet that you want to print, acti-
vate that worksheet, and then click File➪Print or simply press Ctrl+P.
 
 The Print panel box opens in the Backstage View (similar to the one 
shown in Figure 5-1). Be sure that you don’t click the Quick Print button 
on the Quick Access toolbar because doing so sends the active work-
sheet directly to the default printer (without giving you an opportunity 
to change the printer!).

272
Printing from the Excel Backstage View
 
2. Click the name of the new printer that you want to use in the Printer 
drop-down list box.
 
 If the printer that you want to use isn’t listed on the drop-down list, you 
can try to add the printer with the Add Printer link near the bottom of 
the list. When you click this button, Excel opens the Find Printers dialog 
box, where you specify the location for the program to search for the 
printer that you want to use. Note that if you don’t have a printer con-
nected to your computer, clicking the Find Printer button and opening 
the Find Printers dialog box results in opening a Find in the Directory 
alert dialog box with the message, “The Directory Service is Currently 
Unavailable.” When you click OK in this alert dialog box, Excel closes it 
as well as the Find Printers dialog box.
 
3. To change any of the default settings for the printer that you’ve 
selected, click the Printer Properties link Print and then select the 
new settings in the Properties dialog box for the printer that you 
selected.
 
4. Make any other required changes using the options (Pages, Collated, 
and so on) in the Settings section of the Print panel.
 
5. Click the Print button near the top of the left side of the Print panel to 
print the specified worksheet data using the newly selected printer.
Keep in mind that the printer you select and use in printing the current 
worksheet remains the selected printer in Excel until you change back to the 
original printer (or some other printer).
Previewing the printout
Excel 2010 gives you two ways to check the page layout before you send the 
report to the printer. In the worksheet, you can use the Page Layout view 
that shows all the pages plus the margins along with the worksheet and row 
headings and rulers. Or, in the new Excel Backstage View, you can use the 
old standby Print Preview on the right side of the Print panel, which shows 
you the pages of the report more or less as they appear on the printed page.
Checking the paging in Page Layout view
The Page Layout view — activated by clicking the Page Layout View button 
(the center one) to the immediate left of the Zoom slider on the Status bar 
or the Page Layout View command button on the View tab of the Ribbon — 
gives you instant access to the paging of the active worksheet.
As you can see in Figure 5-2, when you switch to Page Layout view, Excel 
adds horizontal and vertical rulers to the column letter and row number 
headings. In the Worksheet area, this view shows the margins for each 
printed page with any headers and footers defined for the report along with 
the breaks between each. (Often you have to use the Zoom slider to reduce 
the screen magnification to display the page breaks on the screen.)

To see all the pages required to print the active worksheet, drag the slider 
button in the Zoom slider on the Status bar to the left until you decrease the 
screen magnification sufficiently to display all the pages of data.
 
Excel displays rulers using the default units for your computer (inches 
on a U.S. computer and centimeters on a European machine). To change 
the units, open the Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog box 
(File➪Options➪Advanced or Alt+FIA) and then select the appropriate unit 
on the Ruler Units drop-down menu (Inches, Centimeters, or Millimeters) in 
the Display section. Remember that you can turn the rulers off and back on 
in Page Layout view by deselecting the Ruler check box in the Show group 
on the View tab (Alt+WR) and then selecting it again (Alt+WR).
Previewing the pages of the report
Save wasted paper and your sanity by using the Print Preview feature before 
you print any worksheet, section of worksheet, or entire workbook. Because 
of the peculiarities in paging worksheet data, check the page breaks for any 
report that requires more than one page. You can use Print Preview in the 
Print panel of the Excel Backstage View to see exactly how the worksheet 
data will be paged when printed. That way, you can return the worksheet 
and make any necessary last-minute changes to the data or page settings 
before sending the report on to the printer.

274
Printing from the Excel Backstage View
To switch to the Print panel and preview the printout, click File➪Print or 
simply press Ctrl+P. Excel displays the first page of the report on the right 
side of the Print panel. Look at Figure 5-3 to see the first preview page of a 
ten-page report as it initially appears in the Print panel.
 
If you use Print Preview frequently (as you should), you might want to add 
the Print Preview button to the Quick Access toolbar and then open the 
Print panel in the Backstage View by clicking this button. To add a Print 
Preview button, click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button and then 
click the Print Preview option under Quick Print on its drop-down menu. 
(To remove the button, simply click this same Print Preview option on the 
Customize Quick Access drop-down menu a second time.)
When Excel displays a full page in the Print Preview window, you sometimes 
can barely read its contents. In such a case, you can increase the view to 
actual size when you need to verify specific regions of the worksheet by 
selecting the Zoom to Page button at the bottom of the Print panel. Check 
out the difference in Figure 5-4 — here you can see what the first page of 
the ten-page report looks like after I zoom in by clicking the Zoom to Page 
button at the bottom of the Print panel.
After you enlarge a page to actual size, use the scroll bars to bring new parts of 
the page into view in the Print Preview window. To return to the full-page view, 
you simply deselect the Zoom to Page button by clicking it a second time.

Excel indicates the number of pages in a report at the bottom left of the Print 
Preview area. If your report has more than one page, view pages that follow 
by clicking the Next Page button. To review a page you’ve already seen, back 
up a page by clicking the Previous Page button immediately below it. (The 
Previous Page button is grayed out if you’re on the first page.) You can also 
advance to a particular page in the report by typing its page number into the 
text box to the immediate right of the Previous Page button that shows the 
current page and then pressing the Enter key.
If you want to display the current margin settings for the report in the print 
preview area, click the Show Margins button at the bottom of the Print panel 
to the immediate left of the Zoom to Page button. After the margins are dis-
played, you can then manually manipulate them by dragging them to new 
positions (see “Massaging the margins” later in this chapter for details.
When you finish previewing the report, you can print the spreadsheet report 
by clicking the Print button in the Print panel or you can exit the Backstage 
View and return to the worksheet by clicking the Back button at the very top 
of the File menu along the left side of the screen.

276
Quick Printing the Worksheet
Quick Printing the Worksheet
As long as you want to use Excel’s default Print to print all the cells in the 
current worksheet, printing in Excel 2010 is a breeze. Simply add the Quick 
Print button to the Quick Access toolbar and then click this button to print 
the current worksheet. To add the Quick Print button to the Quick Access 
toolbar, click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button and then click the 
Quick Preview option on its drop-down menu. Excel then adds a button with 
an icon showing a printer with a check mark.
When you click the Quick Print button, Excel prints one copy of all the infor-
mation in the current worksheet, including any charts and graphics — but 
not including comments you add to cells. (See Book IV, Chapter 3 for details 
about adding comments to your worksheet and Part V for details about 
charts and graphics.)
After you click the Quick Print button, Excel routes the print job to the 
Windows print queue, which acts like a middleman to send the job to the 
printer. While Excel sends the print job to the print queue, Excel displays a 
Printing dialog box to inform you of its progress (displaying such updates as 
Printing Page 2 of 3). After this dialog box disappears, you are free to go back 
to work in Excel. To stop a print job that is in the process of being sent to 
the print queue, click the Cancel button in the Printing dialog box.
If you don’t realize that you want to cancel the print job until after Excel 
finishes shipping it to the print queue (that is, while the Printing dialog 
box appears on-screen), you must open the dialog box for your printer and 
cancel printing from there:
 
1. Click the printer icon in the Notification area at the far right of the 
Windows 7 and Vista or XP taskbar (to the immediate left of the cur-
rent time) with the secondary mouse button to open its shortcut menu.
 
 This printer icon displays the ScreenTip 1 document(s) pending 
for so-and-so. For example, when I’m printing, this message reads 1 
document(s) pending for Greg when I position the mouse pointer 
over the printer icon.
 
2. Right-click the printer icon and then select the Open Active Printers 
command from its shortcut menu.
 
 This opens the dialog box for the printer with the Excel print job in its 
queue (as described under the Document heading in the list box).
 
3. Select the Excel print job that you want to cancel in the list box of 
your printer’s dialog box.
 
4. Choose Document➪Cancel Printing from the menu bar.
 
5. Wait for the print job to disappear from the queue in the printer’s 
dialog box and then click the Close button to get rid of it and return to 
Excel.

Working with the Page Setup Options
About the only thing the slightest bit complex in printing a worksheet is fig-
uring out how to get the pages right. Fortunately, the command buttons in 
the Page Setup group on the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab give you a great deal 
of control over what goes on which page.
There are three groups of buttons on the Page Layout tab that are helpful in 
getting your page settings exactly as you want them: the Page Setup group, 
the Scale to Fit group, and the Sheet Options group, all described in upcom-
ing sections.
 
To see the effect of changes you make to the page setup settings in the 
Worksheet area, put the worksheet into Page Layout view by clicking the 
Page Layout button on the Status bar as you work with the command but-
tons in Page Setup, Scale to Fit, and Sheet Options groups on the Page 
Layout tab.
Using the buttons in the Page Setup group
The Page Setup group of the Page Layout tab contains the following impor-
tant command buttons:
 
✦ Margins: Select one of three preset margins for the report or to set 
custom margins on the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog box. (See 
“Massaging the margins” later in this chapter.)
 
✦ Orientation: Choose between Portrait and Landscape mode for the 
printing (see “Getting the lay of the landscape” later in this chapter).
 
✦ Size: Select one of the preset paper sizes or to set a custom size or to 
change the printing resolution or page number on the Page tab of the 
Page Layout dialog box.
 
✦ Print Area: Set and clear the Print Area. (See “Setting and clearing the 
Print Area” immediately following in this chapter.)
 
✦ Breaks: Insert or remove page breaks. (See “Solving Page Break 
Problems” later in this chapter.)
 
✦ Background: Open the Sheet Background dialog box where you can 
select a new graphic image or photo to be used as a background for 
all the worksheets in the workbook. (Note that this button changes to 
Delete Background as soon as you select a background image.)
 
✦ Print Titles: Open the Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog box where you 
can define rows of the worksheet to repeat at the top and columns at the 
left as print titles for the report. (See “Putting out the print titles” later in 
this chapter.)

278
Working with the Page Setup Options
Setting and clearing the Print Area
Excel includes a special printing feature called the Print Area. You click Print 
Area➪Set Print Area on the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab or press Alt+PRS to 
define any cell selection on a worksheet as the Print Area. After you define the 
Print Area, Excel then prints this cell selection anytime you print the work-
sheet (either with the Quick Print button on the Quick Access toolbar or by 
clicking File➪Print and then clicking the Print button on the Print panel).
 
Whenever you fool with the Print Area, you need to keep in mind that after 
you define it, its cell range is the only one you can print (regardless of what 
other print area options you select in the Print panel unless you click the 
Ignore Print Areas check box at the bottom of the very first drop-down menu 
in the Settings section of the Print panel and until you clear the Print Area).
To clear the Print Area (and therefore go back to the printing defaults Excel 
establishes in the Print panel), you just have to click Print Area➪Clear Print 
Area on the Page Layout tab or simply press Alt+PRC.
 
Keep in mind that you can also define and clear the Print Area from the 
Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog box opened by clicking the dialog box 
launcher button in the Page Setup group on the Page Layout Ribbon tab 
(Alt+PSP). To define the Print Area from this dialog box, click the Print Area 
text box on the Sheet tab to insert the cursor and then select the cell range 
or ranges in the worksheet. (Remember that you can reduce the Page Setup 
dialog box to just this text box by clicking its minimize box.) To clear the 
Print Area from this dialog box, select the cell addresses in the Print Area 
text box and press the Delete key.

The Normal margin settings that Excel applies to a new report use standard 
top and bottom margins of 0.75 inch (3⁄4 inch) and left and right margins of 
0.7 inch with just over a 1⁄4 inch separating the header and footer from the 
top and bottom margins, respectively.
In addition to the Normal margin settings, the program enables you to select 
two other standard margins from the Margins button’s drop-down menu in 
the Print panel (Ctrl+P):
 
✦ Wide margins with 1-inch top, bottom, left, and right margins and 1⁄2 
inch separating the header and footer from the top and bottom margins, 
respectively.
 
✦ Narrow margins with top and bottom margins of 3⁄4 inch, and left and 
right margins of 1⁄4 inch with slightly over 1⁄4 inch separating the header 
and footer from the top and bottom margins, respectively.
Frequently, you find yourself with a report that takes up a full printed page 
and then just enough to spill over onto a second, mostly empty, page. To

squeeze the last column or the last few rows of the worksheet data onto 
Page 1, try selecting Narrow on the Margins button’s drop-down menu.
If that doesn’t do it, you can try manually adjusting the margins for the 
report either from the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog box or by drag-
ging the margin markers in the print preview area on the Print panel in the 
Excel Backstage View. To get more columns on a page, try reducing the left 
and right margins. To get more rows on a page, try reducing the top and 
bottom margins.
To open the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog box (shown in Figure 5-5), 
open the Page Setup dialog box (Alt+PSP) and then click the Margins tab. 
There, enter the new settings in the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right text boxes — 
or select the new margin settings with their respective spinner buttons.

Select one or both Center on Page options in the Margins tab of the Page 
Setup dialog box (refer to Figure 5-5) to center a selection of data (that 
takes up less than a full page) between the current margin settings. In the 
Center on Page section, select the Horizontally check box to center the data 
between the left and right margins. Select the Vertically check box to center 
the data between the top and bottom margins.
If you select the Show Margins check box at the bottom of the Print panel 
in the Excel Backstage View (Ctrl+P) to change the margin settings, you can 
modify the column widths as well as the margins. (See Figure 5-6.) To change 
one of the margins, position the mouse pointer on the desired margin 
marker (the pointer shape changes to a double-headed arrow) and drag the 
marker with your mouse in the appropriate direction. When you release the 
mouse button, Excel redraws the page, using the new margin setting. You 
may gain or lose columns or rows, depending on what kind of adjustment 
you make. Changing the column width is the same story: Drag the column 
marker to the left or right to decrease or increase the width of a particular 
column.

Getting the lay of the landscape
The drop-down menu attached to the Orientation button in the Page Setup 
group of the Page Layout tab of the Ribbon contains two options:
 
✦ Portrait (the default), where the printing runs parallel to the short edge 
of the paper
 
✦ Landscape, where the printing runs parallel to the long edge of the paper
Because many worksheets are far wider than they are tall (such as budgets 
or sales tables that track expenditures over all 12 months), you may find that 
their worksheets page better if you switch the orientation from the normal 
portrait mode (which accommodates fewer columns on a page because the 
printing runs parallel to the short edge of the page) to landscape mode.
In Figure 5-7, you can see the Print panel in the Backstage View with the first 
page of a report in landscape mode in the Page Layout view. For this report, 
Excel can fit three more columns of information on this page in landscape mode 
than it can in portrait mode. Therefore, the total page count for this report 
decreases from ten pages in portrait mode to six pages in landscape mode.

Putting out the print titles
Excel’s Print Titles enable you to print particular row and column headings 
on each page of the report. Print titles are important in multi-page reports 
where the columns and rows of related data spill over to other pages that no 
longer show the row and column headings on the first page.
 
Don’t confuse print titles with the header of a report. Even though both are 
printed on each page, header information prints in the top margin of the 
report; print titles always appear in the body of the report — at the top, in 
the case of rows used as print titles, and on the left, in the case of columns.
To designate rows and/or columns as the print titles for a report, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Print Titles button on the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab or press 
Alt+PI.
 
 The Page Setup dialog box appears with the Sheet tab selected (see 
Figure 5-8).
 
 To designate worksheet rows as print titles, go to Step 2a. To designate 
worksheet columns as print titles, go to Step 2b.

282
Working with the Page Setup Options
 
2a. Select the Rows to Repeat at Top text box and then drag through the 
rows with information you want to appear at the top of each page in 
the worksheet below. If necessary, reduce the Page Setup dialog box 
to just the Rows to Repeat at Top text box by clicking the text box’s 
Collapse/Expand button.
 
 In the example I show you in Figure 5-8, I click the minimize button asso-
ciated with the Rows to Repeat at Top text box and then drag through 
rows 1 and 2 in column A of the Income Analysis worksheet, and the pro-
gram enters the row range $1:$2 in the Rows to Repeat at Top text box.
 
 Note that Excel indicates the print-title rows in the worksheet by plac-
ing a dotted line (that moves like a marquee) on the border between the 
titles and the information in the body of the report.
 
2b. Select the Columns to Repeat at Left text box and then drag through 
the range of columns with the information you want to appear at the 
left edge of each page of the printed report in the worksheet below. 
If necessary, reduce the Page Setup dialog box to just the Columns to 
Repeat at Left text box by clicking its Collapse/Expand button.
 
 Note that Excel indicates the print-title columns in the worksheet by 
placing a dotted line (that moves like a marquee) on the border between 
the titles and the information in the body of the report.
 
3. Click OK or press Enter to close the Page Setup dialog box.
 
 After you close the Page Setup dialog box, the dotted line showing the 
border of the row and/or column titles disappears from the worksheet.
In Figure 5-8, rows 1 and 2 containing the worksheet title and column head-
ings for the Income Analysis worksheet are designated as the print titles 
for the report. In Figure 5-9, you can see the Print Preview window with the 
second page of the report. Note how these print titles appear on all pages of 
the report.

To clear print titles from a report if you no longer need them, open the Sheet 
tab of the Page Setup dialog box and then delete the row and column ranges 
from the Rows to Repeat at Top and the Columns to Repeat at Left text 
boxes before you click OK or press Enter.
Using the buttons in the Scale to Fit group
If your printer supports scaling options, you’re in luck. You can always get a 
worksheet to fit on a single page simply by selecting the 1 Page option on the 
Width and Height drop-down menus attached to their command buttons in 
the Scale to Fit group on the Layout Page tab of the Ribbon. When you select 
these options, Excel figures out how much to reduce the size of the informa-
tion you’re printing to fit it all on one page.
If you preview this one page in the Print panel of the Backstage View (Ctrl+P) 
and find that the printing is just too small to read comfortably, return to the 
worksheet view. Then, reopen the Page tab of the Page Setup dialog box and 
try changing the number of pages in the Page(s) Wide and Tall text boxes (to 
the immediate right of the Fit To option button).
 
Instead of trying to stuff everything on one page, check out how your work-
sheet looks if you fit it on two pages across. Try this: Select 2 Pages on the 
Width button’s drop-down menu on the Page Layout tab and leave 1 Page 

284
Headers and Footers
selected in the Height drop-down list. Alternately, see how the worksheet 
looks on two pages down: Select 1 Page on the Width button’s drop-down 
menu and 2 Pages on the Height button’s drop-down menu.
 
After using the Width and Height Scale to Fit options, you may find that you 
don’t want to scale the printing. Cancel scaling by selecting Automatic on 
both the Width and Height drop-down menus and then entering 100 in the 
Scale text (or select 100 with its spinner buttons).
Using the Print buttons in the Sheet Options group
The Sheet Options group on the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab contains two very 
useful Print check boxes (neither of which is automatically selected). The 
first is in the Gridlines column and the second in the Headings column:
 
✦ Select the Print check box in the Gridlines column to print the column 
and row gridlines on each page of the report.
 
✦ Select the Print check box in the Headings column to print the row head-
ings with the row numbers, and the column headings with the column 
letters on each page of the report.
 
Select both check boxes (by clicking them to put check marks in them) when 
you want the printed version of your spreadsheet data to match as closely 
as their on-screen appearance. This is useful when you need to use the cell 
references on the printout to help you later locate the cells in the actual 
worksheet that need editing.
Headers and Footers
Headers and footers are simply standard text that appears on every page of 
the report. A header is printed in the top margin of the page, and a footer is 
printed — you guessed it — in the bottom margin. Both are centered verti-
cally in the margins. Unless you specify otherwise, Excel does not automati-
cally add either a header or footer to a new workbook.
 
Use headers and footers in a report to identify the document used to produce 
the report and display the page numbers and the date and time of printing.
The easiest way to add a header or footer to a report is to add it after put-
ting the worksheet in Page Layout view by clicking the Page Layout View 
button on the Status bar (or by clicking the Page Layout View button on the 
Ribbon’s View tab or by just pressing Alt+WP).
When the worksheet’s displayed in Page Layout view, position the mouse 
pointer over the section in the top margin of the first page marked Click to 
Add Header or in the bottom margin of the first page marked Click to Add 
Footer.

Headers and Footers
 
To create a centered header or footer, highlight the center section of this 
header/footer area and then click the mouse pointer to set the insertion point 
in the middle of the section. To add a left-aligned header or footer, highlight 
and then click to set the insertion point flush with the left edge of the left-hand 
section, or to add a right-aligned header or footer, highlight and click to set 
the insertion point flush with the right edge of the right-hand section.
Immediately after setting the insertion point in the left, center, or right sec-
tion of the header/footer area, Excel adds a Header & Footer Tools contex-
tual tab with its own Design tab (see Figure 5-10). The Design tab is divided 
into Auto Header & Footer, Header & Footer Elements, Navigation, and 
Options groups.

Adding an Auto Header or Auto Footer
The Auto Header and Auto Footer buttons on the Design tab of the Header 
& Footer Tools contextual tab (see Color Plate 10) enable you to add stock 
headers and footers in an instant simply by clicking their examples from the 
drop-down menus that appear when you click them.
To create the centered header and footer for the report shown in Figure 5-11, I 
first selected
Income Analysis, Confidential, Page 1

286
Headers and Footers
on the Auto Header button’s drop-down menu. (Income Analysis is the name 
of the worksheet; Confidential is stock text; and Page 1 is, of course, the cur-
rent page number.)
To set up the footer, I chose
Page 1 of ?
in the Auto Footer button’s drop-down menu (which puts the current page 
number, along with the total number of pages, in the report). You can select 
this paging option in either the Header or Footer drop-down list box.

Check out the results in Figure 5-11, which is the first page of the report in 
Page Layout view. Here you can see the header and footer as they will print. 
You can also see how choosing Page 1 of ? works in the footer: On the first 
page, you see the centered footer: Page 1 of 6; on the second page, you 
would see the centered footer Page 2 of 6.
 
If, after selecting some stock header or footer info, you decide that you no 
longer need either the header or footer printed in your report, click the 
header or footer in Page Layout view and then click the (none) option at the 
top of the Auto Header button’s or Auto Footer button’s drop-down menu

Headers and Footers
(the Design tab on the Header & Footer Tools contextual tab automatically 
appears and is selected on the Ribbon the moment you click the header or 
footer in Page Layout view).
Creating a custom header or footer
Most of the time, the stock headers and footers available on the Auto Header 
button’s and Auto Footer button’s drop-down menus are sufficient for your 
report printing needs. Every once in a while, however, you may want to 
insert information not available in these list boxes or in an arrangement 
Excel doesn’t offer in the readymade headers and footers.
For those times, you need to use the command buttons that appear in the 
Header & Footer Elements group of the Design tab on the Header & Footer 
Tools contextual tab. These command buttons enable you to blend your 
own information with that generated by Excel into different sections of the 
custom header or footer you’re creating.
The command buttons in the Header & Footer Elements group include the 
following:
 
✦ Page Number: Click this button to insert the &[Page] code that puts in 
the current page number.
 
✦ Number of Pages: Click this button to insert the &[Pages] code that 
puts in the total number of pages.
 
✦ Current Date: Click this button to insert the &[Date] code that puts in 
the current date.
 
✦ Current Time: Click this button to insert the &[Time] code that puts in 
the current time.
 
✦ File Path: Click this button to insert the &[Path]&[File] code that 
puts in the directory path along with the name of the workbook file.
 
✦ File Name: Click this button to insert the &[File] code that puts in the 
name of the workbook file.
 
✦ Sheet Name: Click this button to insert the &[Tab] code that puts in the 
name of the worksheet as shown on the sheet tab.
 
✦ Picture: Click this button to insert the &[Picture] code that inserts 
the image that you select from the Insert Picture dialog box (that shows 
the contents of the My Pictures folder on your computer by default).
 
✦ Format Picture: Click this button to apply the formatting that you 
choose from the Format Picture dialog box to the &[Picture] code 
that you enter with the Insert Picture button without adding any code of 
its own.

288
Headers and Footers
To use these command buttons in the Header & Footer Elements group to 
create a custom header or footer, follow these steps:
 
1. Put your worksheet into Page Layout view by clicking the Page Layout 
View button on the Status bar or by clicking View➪Page Layout View 
on the Ribbon or pressing Alt+WP.
 
 In Page Layout view, the text, Click to Add Header, appears centered 
in the top margin of the first page, and the text, Click to Add Footer, 
appears centered in the bottom margin.
 
2. Position the mouse pointer in the top margin to create a custom header 
or in the bottom margin to create a custom footer, and then click the 
pointer in the left, center, or right section of the header or footer to set 
the insertion point and left-align, center, or right-align the text.
 
 When Excel sets the insertion point, the text, Click to Add Header and 
Click to Add Footer, disappears and the Design tab on the Header & 
Footer Tools contextual tab becomes active on the Ribbon.
 
3. To add program-generated information to your custom header or footer 
such as the filename, worksheet name, current date, and so forth, click 
its command button in the Header & Footer Elements group.
 
 Excel inserts the appropriate header/footer code preceded by an amper-
sand (&) in the header or footer. These codes are replaced by the actual 
information (filename, worksheet name, graphic image, and the like) as 
soon as you click another section of the header or footer or finish the 
header or footer by clicking the mouse pointer outside of it.
 
4. (Optional) To add your own text to the custom header or footer, type 
it at the insertion point.
 
 When joining program-generated information indicated by a header/
footer code with your own text, be sure to insert the appropriate spaces 
and punctuation. For example, to have Excel display Page 1 of 4 in a 
custom header or footer, you do the following:
 
a. Type the word Page and press the spacebar.
 
b. Click the Page Number command button and press the spacebar 
again.
 
c. Type the word of and press the spacebar a third time.
 
d. Click the Number of Pages command button.
 
 This inserts Page &[Page] of &[Pages] in the custom header (or 
footer).
 
5. (Optional) To modify the font, font size, or some other font attribute 
of your custom header or footer, drag through its codes and text, click 
the Home tab, and then click the appropriate command button in the 
Font group.

Headers and Footers
 
 In addition to selecting a new font and font size for the custom header or 
footer, you can add bold, italics, underlining, and a new font color to its 
text with the Bold, Italic, Underline, and Font Color command buttons on 
the Home tab.
 
6. After you finish defining and formatting the codes and text in your 
custom header or footer, click a cell in the Worksheet area to deselect 
the header or footer area.
 
 Excel replaces the header/footer codes in the custom header or footer 
with the actual information, while at the same time removing the Header 
& Footer Tools contextual tab from the Ribbon.
Figure 5-12 shows you a custom footer I added to a spreadsheet in Page 
Layout view. This custom footer blends my own text, Preliminary, with 
program-generated page, date, and time information, and uses all three sec-
tions: left-aligned page information, a centered Preliminary warning, and 
right-aligned current date and time.

Creating unique first-page headers and footers
Excel 2010 enables you to define a header or footer for the first page that’s dif-
ferent from all the rest of the pages. Simply click the Different First Page check 
box to put a check mark in it. (This check box is part of the Options group 
of the Design tab on the Header & Footer Tools contextual tab that appears 
when you’re defining or editing a header or footer in Page Layout view.)

290
Solving Page Break Problems
After selecting the Different First Page check box, go ahead and define the 
unique header and/or footer for just the first page (now marked First Page 
Header or First Page Footer), and then, on the second page of the report, 
define the header and/or footer (marked simply Header or Footer) for the 
remaining pages of the report (see “Adding an Auto Header or Auto Footer” 
and “Creating a custom header or footer” earlier in the chapter for details).
 
Use this feature when your spreadsheet report has a cover page that needs 
no header or footer. For example, say you have a report that needs the cur-
rent page number and total pages centered at the bottom of all pages but the 
first, cover page. To do this, select the Different First Page check box on the 
Design tab of the Header & Footer Tools contextual tab on the Ribbon and 
then define a centered Auto Footer that displays the current page number 
and total pages (Page 1 of ?) on the second page of the report, leaving the 
Click to Add Footer text intact on the first page.
Excel will correctly number both the total number of pages in the report 
and the current page number without printing this information on the first 
page. So if your report has a total of six pages (including the cover page), the 
second page footer will read Page 2 of 6; the third page, Page 3 of 6; and so 
on, even if the first printed page has no footer at all.
Creating different even and odd page headers and footers
If you plan to do two-sided printing or copying of your spreadsheet report, 
you may want to define one header or footer for the even pages and another 
for the odd pages of the report. That way, the header or footer informa-
tion (such as the report name or current page) alternates from being right-
aligned on the odd pages (printed on the front side of the page) to being 
left-aligned on the even pages (printed on the back side of the page).
To create an alternating header or footer for a report, you click the Different 
Odd & Even Pages check box to put a check mark in it. (This check box is 
found in the Options group of the Design tab on the Header & Footer Tools 
contextual tab that appears when you’re defining or editing a header or 
footer in Page Layout view.)
After that, create a header or footer on the first page of the report (now 
marked Odd Page Header or Odd Page Footer) in the third, right-aligned sec-
tion header or footer area, and then re-create this header or footer on the 
second page (now marked Even Page Header or Even Page Footer), this time 
in the first, left-aligned section.
Solving Page Break Problems
The Page Break Preview feature in Excel enables you to spot page break 
problems in an instant as well as fix them, such as when the program wants

to split onto different pages information that you know should always 
appear on the same page.
Figure 5-13 shows a worksheet in Page Break Preview with an example of a 
bad vertical page break that you can remedy by adjusting the location of the 
page break on Pages 1 and 3. Given the page size, orientation, and margin 
settings for this report, Excel breaks the page between columns H and I. This 
break separates the April, May, and June sales on Page 1 from the Qtr 2 sub-
totals on Page 3.
 
Figure 5-13: 
Preview 
page breaks 
in a report in 
Page Break

To prevent the data in the Paid column from being printed alone on its own 
pages, you need to move the page break to a column on the left. In this case, 
I chose to move the page break back between columns E (with the Qtr 1 
subtotals) and F (containing the April sales) so that the second quarter sales 
and subtotals are printed together on Page 3. Figure 5-13 shows how you 
can create the vertical page break in Page Break Preview mode by following 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Page Break Preview button (the third one in the cluster of 
three to the left of the Zoom slider) on the Status bar or click View➪
Page Break Preview on the Ribbon or press Alt+WI.
 
 This takes you into a Page Break Preview mode that shows your 
worksheet data at a reduced magnification (60 percent of normal in 

292

page breaks shown by heavy lines between the columns and rows of the 
worksheet.
 
 The first time you choose this command, Excel displays a Welcome to 
Page Break Preview dialog box. To prevent this dialog box from reap-
pearing each time you use Page Break Preview, click the Do Not Show 
This Dialog Again check box before you close the Welcome to Page 
Break Preview alert dialog box.
 
2. Click OK or press Enter to get rid of the Welcome to Page Break 
Preview alert dialog box.
 
3. Position the mouse pointer somewhere on the page break indicator 
(one of the heavy lines surrounding the representation of the page) 
that you need to adjust; when the pointer changes to a double-headed 
arrow, drag the page indicator to the desired column or row and 
release the mouse button.
 
 For the example shown in Figure 5-13, I dragged the page break indicator 
between Pages 1 and 3 to the left so that it’s between columns E and F.

(and, presumably, printing the report), click the Normal button (the 
first one in the cluster of three to the left of the Zoom slider) on the 
Status bar or click View➪Normal on the Ribbon or press Alt+WL to 
return the worksheet to its regular view of the data.
 
You can also insert your own manual page breaks at the cell cursor’s posi-
tion by clicking Insert Page Break on the Breaks button’s drop-down menu 
on the Page Layout tab (Alt+PBI), and remove them by clicking Remove 
Page Break on this menu (Alt+PBR). To remove all manual page breaks that 
you’ve inserted into a report, click Reset All Page Breaks on the Breaks but-
ton’s drop-down menu (Alt+PBA).
Printing the Formulas in a Report
There’s one more printing technique you may need every once in a while 
and that’s how to print the formulas in a worksheet in a report instead of 
printing the calculated results of the formulas. You can check over a print-
out of the formulas in your worksheet to make sure that you haven’t done 
anything stupid (like replace a formula with a number or use the wrong cell 
references in a formula) before you distribute the worksheet company-wide.
Before you can print a worksheet’s formulas, you have to display the for-
mulas, rather than their results, in the cells by clicking the Show Formulas 
button (the one that kind of looks like a page of a calendar with a tiny 15 
above an fx) in the Formula Auditing group on the Formulas tab of the 
Ribbon (Alt+MH).
Excel then displays the contents of each cell in the worksheet as they nor-
mally appear only in the Formula bar or when you’re editing them in the 
cell. Notice that value entries lose their number formatting, formulas appear 
in their cells (Excel widens the columns with best-fit so that the formulas 
appear in their entirety), and long text entries no longer spill over into neigh-
boring blank cells.
 
Excel allows you to toggle between the normal cell display and the formula cell 
display by pressing Ctrl+`. (That is, press Ctrl and the key with the tilde on top.) 
This key — usually found in the upper-left corner of your keyboard — does dou-
ble-duty as a tilde and as a weird backward accent mark: ` (Don’t confuse that 
backward accent mark with the apostrophe that appears on the same key as the 
quotation mark!)
After Excel displays the formulas in the worksheet, you are ready to print it 
as you would any other report. You can include the worksheet column let-
ters and row numbers as headings in the printout so that if you do spot an 
error, you can pinpoint the cell reference right away.

294
Printing the Formulas in a Report
 
To include the row and column headings in the printout, put a check mark in 
the Print check box in the Headings column on the Sheet Options group of 
the Page Layout tab of the Ribbon before you send the report to the printer.
After you print the worksheet with the formulas, return the worksheet to 
normal by clicking the Show Formulas button on the Formulas tab of the 
Ribbon or by pressing Ctrl+’.

ormulas, to put it mildly, are the very “bread and butter” of the work-
sheet. Without formulas, the electronic spreadsheet would be little 
better than its green-sheet paper equivalent. Fortunately, Excel gives you 
the ability to do all your calculations right within the cells of the worksheet 
without any need for a separate calculator.
The formulas that you build in a spreadsheet can run the gamut from very 
simple to extremely complex. Formulas can rely totally upon the use of 
simple operators or the use of built-in functions, both of which describe 
the type of operation or calculation to perform and the order in which to 
perform it. Or they can blend the use of operators and functions together. 
When you use Excel functions in your formulas, you need to learn what 
particular type of information that particular function uses in performing its 
calculations. The information that you supply a function and that it uses in 
its computation is referred to as the argument(s) of the function.
Formulas 101
From the simple addition formula to the most complex ANOVA statistical 
variation, all formulas in Excel have one thing in common: They all begin 
with the equal sign (=). This doesn’t mean that you always have to type in 

298
Formulas 101
the equal sign — although if you do, Excel expects that a formula of some 
type is to follow. When building a formula that uses a built-in function, often-
times you use the Insert Function button on the Formula bar to select and 
insert the function, in which case, Excel adds the opening equal sign for you.
 
If you’re an old Lotus 1-2-3 user and you type @@ to start a function, Excel 
automatically converts the @@ sign into the equal sign the moment that you 
complete the formula entry. It does mean, however, that each and every 
completed formula that appears on the Formula bar starts with the equal 
sign.
When building your formulas, you can use constants that actually contain 
the number that you want used in the calculation (such as “4.5%,” “$25.00,” 
or “–78.35”), or you can use cell addresses between the operators or as the 
arguments of functions. When you create a formula that uses cell addresses, 
Excel then uses the values that you’ve input in those cells in calculating 
the formula. Unlike when using constants in formulas, when you use cell 
addresses, Excel automatically updates the results calculated by a formula 
whenever you edit the values in the cells to which it refers.
Formula building methods
When building formulas manually, you can either type in the cell addresses 
or you can point to them in the worksheet. Using the Pointing method to 
supply the cell addresses for formulas is often easier and is always a much 
more foolproof method of formula building; when you type in a cell address, 
you are less apt to notice that you’ve just designated the wrong cell than 
when pointing directly to it. For this reason, stick to pointing when build-
ing original formulas and restrict typing cell addresses to the odd occasion 
when you need to edit a cell address in a formula and pointing to it is either 
not practical or just too much trouble.
When you use the Pointing method to build a simple formula that defines a 
sequence of operations, you stop and click the cell or drag through the cell 
range after typing each operator in the formula. When using the method 
to build a formula that uses a built-in function, you click the cell or drag 
through the cell range that you want used when defining the function’s argu-
ments in the Function Arguments dialog box.
 
As with the other types of cell entries, you must take some action to com-
plete a formula and enter it into the current cell (such as clicking the Enter 
button on the Formula bar, pressing the Enter key, or pressing an arrow 
key). Unlike when entering numeric or text entries, however, you will want 
to stay clear of clicking another cell to complete the data entry. This is 
because, when you click a cell when building or editing a formula on the 
Formula bar, more often than not, you end up not only selecting the new 
cell, but also adding its address to the otherwise complete formula.

Formulas 101
As soon as you complete a formula entry, Excel calculates the result, which 
is then displayed inside the cell within the worksheet (the contents of the 
formula, however, continue to be visible on the Formula bar anytime the 
cell is active). If you make an error in the formula that prevents Excel from 
being able to calculate the formula at all, Excel displays an Alert dialog box 
suggesting how to fix the problem. If, however, you make an error that pre-
vents Excel from being able to display a proper result when it calculates the 
formula, the program displays an Error value rather than the expected com-
puted value (see Book III, Chapter 2 for details on dealing with both of these 
types of errors in formulas).
Editing formulas
As with numeric and text entries, you can edit the contents of formulas 
either in their cells or on the Formula bar. To edit a formula in its cell, 
double-click the cell or press F2 to position the pointer in that cell (double-
clicking the cell positions the insertion pointer in the middle of the formula, 
whereas pressing F2 positions it at the end of the formula — you can also 
double-click at the beginning or end of the cell to position the pointer there). 
To edit a formula on the Formula bar, use the I-beam pointer to position the 
insertion point at the place in the formula that needs editing first.
As soon as you put the Excel program into Edit mode, Excel displays each 
of the cell references in the formula within the cell in a different color and 
uses this color to outline the cell or cell range in the worksheet itself. This 
enables you to quickly identify the cells and their values that are referred to 
in your formula and, if necessary, modify them as well. You can use any of 
the four sizing handles that appear around the cell or cell range to modify 
the cell selection in the worksheet and consequently update the cell refer-
ences in the formula.
Formulas and formatting
When defining a formula that uses operators 
or functions, Excel picks up the number for-
matting of the cells that are referenced in the 
formula. For example, if you add cell A2 to B3, 
as in =A2+B3, and cell B3 is formatted with the 
Currency Style format, the result will inherit 
this format and be displayed in its cell using 
the Currency Style.

Formulas 101
When you AutoSum numbers in a spreadsheet
The easiest and often the most used formula that you will create is the one 
that totals rows and columns of numbers in your spreadsheet. Usually, to 
total a row or column of numbers, you can click the Sum command button 
in the Editing group of the Home tab of the Ribbon (the one with the S on it). 
When you click this button, Excel inserts the built-in SUM function into the 
active cell and simultaneously selects what the program thinks is the most 
likely range of numbers that you want summed.
 
Instead of taking the time to click the Sum button on the Home tab, it’s often 
faster and easier to simply press Alt+= (equal sign) to insert the SUM func-
tion in the current cell and have Excel select the range of cells most likely to 
be totaled.
Figure 1-1 demonstrates how this works. For this figure, I positioned the cell 
cursor in cell B8, which is the first cell where I need to build a formula that 
totals the various parts produced in April. I then clicked the Sum button on 
the Home tab of the Ribbon.
As Figure 1-1 shows, Excel then inserted an equal sign followed by the SUM 
function and correctly suggested the cell range B4:B7 as the argument to this 
function (that is, the range to be summed). Because Excel correctly selected 
the range to be summed (leaving out the date value in cell B3), all I have to do 
is click the Enter button on the Formula bar to have the April total calculated.
Figure 1-2 shows another example of AutoSum to instantly build a SUM for-
mula, this time to total the monthly production numbers for Part 100 in cell 
K4. Again, all I did to create the formula shown in Figure 1-2 was to select cell 
K4 and then click the Sum button on the Home tab. Again, Excel correctly 
selected B4:J4 as the range to be summed (rightly ignoring cell A4 with the 
row title) and input this range as the argument of the SUM function. All that 
remains to be done is to click the Enter button on the Formula bar to com-
pute the monthly totals for Part 100.
Using Excel like a handheld calculator
Sometimes, you may need to actually calculate 
the number that you need to input in a cell as a 
constant. Instead of reaching for your pocket 
calculator to compute the needed value and 
then manually entering it into a cell of your 
spreadsheet, you can set up a formula in the 
cell that returns the number that you need 
to input and then convert the formula into a 
constant value. You convert the formula into a 
constant by pressing F2 to edit the cell, immedi-
ately pressing F9 to recalculate the formula and 
display the result on the Formula bar, and then 
clicking the Enter button on the Formula bar or 
pressing the Enter key to input the calculated 
result into the cell (as though you had manually 
input the result in the cell).

Formulas 101
If for some reason AutoSum doesn’t select the entire or correct range that 
you want summed, you can adjust the range by dragging the cell cursor 
through the cell range or by clicking the marquee around the cell range, 
which turns the marching ants into a solid colored outline. Then position 
the mouse pointer on one of the sizing handles at the four corners. When it 
turns into a thick white arrowhead pointing to the center of a pair of black 
double-crossed arrows, drag the outline until it includes all the cells you 
want included in the total.
 
Keep in mind that all Excel functions enclose their argument(s) in a closed 
pair of parentheses as shown in the examples with the SUM function. Even 
those rare functions that don’t require any arguments at all still require the 
use of a closed pair of parentheses (even when you don’t put anything inside 
of them).
Building formulas with operators
Many of the simpler formulas that you build require the sole use of Excel’s 
operators, which are the symbols that indicate the type of computation that 
is to take place between the cells and/or constants interspersed between 
them. Excel uses four different types of operators: arithmetic, comparison, 
text, and reference. Table 1-1 shows all these operators arranged by type 
and accompanied by an example.
When AutoSum doesn’t sum
Although the Sum button’s primary function is 
to build formulas with the SUM function that 
totals ranges of numbers, that’s not its only 
function (pun intended). Indeed, you can have 
the AutoSum feature build formulas that com-
pute the average value, count the number of 
values, or return the highest or lowest value in 
a range — all you have to do is click the drop-
down button that’s attached to the Sum com-
mand button on the Home tab and then click 
Average, Count Numbers, Max, or Min on its 
drop-down menu.
Also, don’t forget about the Average, Count, and 
Sum indicator on the Status bar. This indicator 
automatically shows you the average value, 
the count of the numbers, and the total of all 
numbers in the current cell selection. You can 
use this feature to preview the total that’s to be 
returned by the SUM formula that you create 
with the AutoSum button by selecting the cell 
range that contains the numbers to be summed.

Formulas 101
“Smooth operator”
Most of the time, you’ll rely on the arithmetic operators when building 
formulas in your spreadsheets that don’t require functions because these 
operators actually perform computations between the numbers in the vari-
ous cell references and produce new mathematical results.
The comparison operators, on the other hand, produce only the logical 
value TRUE or the logical value FALSE, depending on whether the compari-
son is accurate. For example, if you enter the following formula in cell A10:
=B10<>C10
If B10 contains the number 15 and C10 contains the number 20, the formula 
in A10 returns the logical value TRUE. If, however, both cell B10 and C10 con-
tain the value 12, the formula returns the logical value FALSE.
The single text operator (the so-called ampersand) is used in formulas to 
join together two or more text entries (an operation with the highfalutin’ 
name concatenation). For example, suppose that you enter the following for-
mula in cell C2:
=A2&B2
If cell A2 contains John and cell B2 contains Smith, the formula returns the 
new (squashed together) text entry, JohnSmith. To have the formula insert 
a space between the first and last names, you have to include the space as 
part of the concatenation as follows:
=A2&” “&B2
 
You most often use the comparison operators with the IF function when 
building more complex formulas that perform one type of operation when 
the IF condition is TRUE and another when it is FALSE. You use the concat-
enating operator (&) when you need to join text entries that come to you 
entered in separate cells but that need to be entered in single cells (like the 
first and last names in separate columns). See Book III, Chapter 2 for more 
on logical formulas, and Book III, Chapter 6 for more on text formulas.
Order of operator precedence
When you build a formula that combines different operators, Excel follows 
the set order of operator precedence, as shown in Table 1-2. When you use 
operators that share the same level of precedence, Excel evaluates each ele-
ment in the equation by using a strictly left-to-right order.

All Comparison Operators
Suppose that you enter the following formula in cell A4:
=B4+C4/D4
Because multiplication has a higher level of precedence than addition (4 
versus 5), Excel evaluates the division between cells C4 and D4 and then 
adds that result to the value in cell B4. If, for example, cell B4 contains 2, 
C4 contains 9, and D4 contains 3, Excel would essentially be evaluating this 
equation in cell A4:
=2+9/3
In this example, the calculated result displayed in cell A4 is 5 because the 
program first performs the division (9/3) that returns the result 3 and then 
adds it to the 2 to get the final result of 5.
If you had wanted Excel to evaluate this formula in a strictly left-to-right 
manner, you could get it to do so by enclosing the leftmost operation (the 
addition between B4 and C4) in a closed pair of parentheses. Parentheses 
alter the natural order of precedence so that any operation enclosed within 
a pair is performed before the other operations in the formula, regardless of 
level in the order (after that, the natural order is once again used).
To have Excel perform the addition between the first two terms (B4 and C4) 
and then divide the result by the third term (cell D4), you modify the original 
formula by enclosing the addition operation in parentheses as follows:
=(B4+C4)/D4
Assuming that cells B4, C4, and D4 still contain the same numbers (2, 9, 
and 3, respectively), the formula now calculates the result as 3.666667 and 
returns it to cell A4 (2+9=11 and 11/3=3.66667).

306
Formulas 101
If necessary, you can nest parentheses in your formulas by putting one set 
of parentheses within another (within another, within another, and so on). 
When you nest parentheses, Excel performs the calculation in the innermost 
pair of parentheses first before anything else and then starts performing the 
operations in the outer parentheses.
Consider the following sample formula:
=B5+(C5–D5)/E5
In this formula, the parentheses around the subtraction (C5–D5) ensure that 
it is the first operation performed. After that, however, the natural order of 
precedence takes over. So the result of the subtraction is then divided by 
the value in E5, and that result is then added to the value in B5. If you want 
the addition to be performed before the division, you need to nest the first 
set of parentheses within another set as follows:
=(B5+(C5–D5))/E5
In this revised formula, Excel performs the subtraction between the values 
in C5 and D5, adds the result to the value in cell B5, and then divides that 
result by the value in cell E5.
 
Of course, the biggest problem with parentheses is that you have to 
remember to enter them in pairs. If you forget to balance each set of nested 
parentheses by having a right parenthesis for every left parenthesis, Excel 
displays an Alert dialog box, informing you that it has located an error in the 
formula. It will also suggest a correction that would balance the parentheses 
used in the formula. Although the suggested correction corrects the imbal-
ance in the formula, it unfortunately doesn’t give you the calculation order 
that you wanted — and if accepted, the suggested correction would give 
you what you consider an incorrect result. For this reason, be very careful 
before you click the Yes button in this kind of Alert dialog box. Do so only 
when you’re certain that the corrected parentheses give you the calculation 
order that you want. Otherwise, click No and balance the parentheses in the 
formula by adding the missing parenthesis or parentheses yourself.
Using the Insert Function button
Excel supports a wide variety of built-in functions that you can use when 
building formulas. Of course, the most popular built-in function is by far 
the SUM function, which is automatically inserted when you click the Sum 
command button on the Home tab of the Ribbon (keep in mind that you can 
also use this drop-down button attached to the Sum button to insert the 
AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, and MIN functions — see the “When you AutoSum 
numbers in a spreadsheet” section previously in this chapter for details). 
To use other Excel functions, you can use the Insert Function button on the 
Formula bar (the one with the fx).

Book III
Chapter 1

307
Formulas 101
When you click the Insert Function button, Excel displays the Insert Function 
dialog box, similar to the one shown in Figure 1-3. You can then use its 
options to find and select the function that you want to use and to define 
the argument or arguments that the function requires in order to perform its 
calculation.
To select the function that you want to use, you can use any of the following 
methods:
 
✦ Click the function name if it’s one that you’ve used lately and is there-
fore already listed in the Select a Function list box.
 
✦ Click the name of the category of the function that you want to use in 
the Or Select a Category drop-down list box (Most Recently Used is the 
default category), and then select the function that you want to use in 
that category in the Select a Function list box.
 
✦ Replace the text “Type a brief description of what you want to do and 
then click Go” in the Search for a Function text box with keywords or 
a phrase about the type of calculation that you want to do (such as 
“return on investment”). Click the Go button or press Enter and click the 
function that you want to use in the Recommended category displayed 
in the Select a Function list box.

When selecting the function to use in the Select a Function list box, click 
the function name to have Excel give you a short description of what the 
function does, displayed underneath the name of the function with its 
argument(s) shown in parentheses (referred to as the function’s syntax). 
To get help on using the function, click the Help on This Function link dis-
played in the lower-left corner of the Insert Function dialog box to open the 
Help window in its own pane on the right. When you finish reading and/or 
printing this help topic, click the Close button to close the Help window and 
return to the Insert Function dialog box.

308
Formulas 101
 
You can select the most commonly used types of Excel functions and enter 
them simply by clicking their names on the drop-down menus attached to 
their command buttons in the Function Library group of the Formulas tab of 
the Ribbon. These command buttons include Financial, Logical, Text, Date & 
Time, Lookup & Reference, and Math & Trig. In addition, you can select func-
tions in the Statistical, Engineering, Cube, Information, and Compatibility 
categories from continuation menus that appear when you click the More 
Functions command button on the Formulas tab. And if you find you need to 
insert a function in the worksheet that you recently entered into the work-
sheet, chances are good that when you click the Recently Used command 
button, that function will be listed on its drop-down menu for you to select.
When you click OK after selecting the function that you want to use in the 
current cell, Excel inserts the function name followed by a closed set of 
parentheses on the Formula bar. At the same time, the program closes the 
Insert Function dialog box and then opens the Function Arguments dialog 
box, similar to the one shown in Figure 1-4. You then use the argument text 
box or boxes displayed in the Function Arguments dialog box to specify 
what numbers and other information are to be used when the function calcu-
lates its result.
 
All functions — even those that don’t take any arguments, such as the 
TODAY function — follow the function name by a closed set of parentheses, 
as in =TODAY(). If the function requires arguments (and almost all require 
at least one), these arguments must appear within the parentheses following 
the function name. When a function requires multiple arguments, such as 
the DATE function, the various arguments are entered in the required order 
(as in year, month, day for the DATE function) within the parentheses sepa-
rated by commas, as in DATE(33,7,23).

When you use the text boxes in the Function Arguments dialog box to 
input the arguments for a function, you can select the cell or cell range in 
the worksheet that contains the entries that you want used. Click the text 
box for the argument that you want to define, and then either start drag-
ging the cell cursor through the cells or, if the Function Arguments dialog

box is obscuring the first cell in the range that you want to select, click the 
Collapse Dialog Box button located to the immediate right of the text box. 
Dragging or clicking this button reduces the Function Arguments dialog box 
to just the currently selected argument text box, thus enabling you to drag 
through the rest of the cells in the range.
If you started dragging without first clicking the Collapse Dialog Box button, 
Excel automatically expands the Function Arguments dialog box as soon as 
you release the mouse button. If you clicked the Collapse Dialog Box button, 
you have to click the Expand Dialog Box button (which replaces the Collapse 
Dialog Box button located to the right of the argument text box) in order to 
restore the Function Arguments dialog box to its original size.
As you define arguments for a function in the Function Arguments dialog 
box, Excel shows you the calculated result following the heading, “Formula 
result =” near the bottom of the Function Arguments dialog box. When you 
finish entering the required argument(s) for your function (and any optional 
arguments that may pertain to your particular calculation), click OK to have 
Excel close the Function Arguments dialog box and replace the formula in 
the current cell display with the calculated result.
 
You can also type the name of the function instead of selecting it from the 
Insert Function dialog box. When you begin typing a function name after 
typing an equal sign (=), Excel’s AutoComplete feature kicks in by displaying 
a drop-down menu with the names of all the functions that begin with the 
character(s) you type. You can then enter the name of the function you want 
to use by double-clicking its name in this drop-down menu. Excel then enters 
the function name along with the open parenthesis as in =DATE( so that you 
can then begin selecting the cell range(s) for the first argument.
 
For details on how to use different types of built-in functions for your 
spreadsheets, refer to the following chapters in Book III that discuss the use 
of various categories: Refer to Chapter 2 for information on Logical func-
tions, Chapter 3 for Date and Time functions, Chapter 4 for Financial func-
tions, Chapter 5 for Math and Statistical functions, and Chapter 6 for Lookup, 
Information, and Text functions.
Copying Formulas
Copying formulas is one of the most common tasks that you do in a typi-
cal spreadsheet that relies primarily on formulas. When a formula uses cell 
references rather than constant values (as most should), Excel makes the 
task of copying an original formula to every place that requires a similar 
location a piece of cake. The program does this by automatically adjusting 
the cell references in the original formula to suit the position of the copies 
that you make. It does this through a system known as relative cell addresses, 
whereby the column references in the cell address in the formula change to 

310
Copying Formulas
suit their new column position and the row references change to suit their 
new row position.
Figures 1-5 and 1-6 illustrate how this works. For Figure 1-5, I used the 
AutoSum button in cell B8 to build the original formula that uses the SUM 
function that totals the April 2010 sales. The formula in cell B7 reads:
=SUM(B4:B7)
I then used the AutoFill feature to copy this formula by dragging the Fill 
handle to include the cell range B8:K8 (copying the formula with the cut-and-
paste method would work just as well, although it’s a little more work). Note 
in the cell range C8:K8 that Excel did not copy the original formula to the 
other cells verbatim (otherwise each of the copied formulas would return 
the same result, 1,915, as the original in cell B8). If you look at the Formula 
bar in Figure 1-5, you see that the copy of the original formula in cell C8 
reads
=SUM(C4:C7)
In this copy, Excel adjusted the column reference of the range being summed 
from B to C to suit the new position of the copy. Figure 1-6 shows how this 
works when copying an original formula in the other direction, this time 
down a column. For this figure, I used the AutoSum button to create a SUM 
formula that totals all the monthly sales for Part 100 in row 4. The formula in 
cell K4 reads:
=SUM(B4:J4)
You can then use the Fill handle to copy this formula down the last column 
of the table to include the cell range by positioning the cell cursor in K4 and 
then dragging the Fill handle down to select K4:K7. If you were to then posi-
tion the cell cursor in cell K5, you would see on the Formula bar that when 
Excel copied the original formula in cell K4 down to cell K5, it automatically 
adjusted the row reference to suit its new position so that the formula in cell 
K5 reads:
=SUM(B5:J5)
Although at first glance it appears that Excel isn’t making exact copies of the 
original formula when it uses the relative cell addressing, that isn’t techni-
cally true. Although the cell column references in the first example in Figure 
1-5 and the row references in the second example in Figure 1-6 appear to 
be adjusted to suit the new column and row position when you view the 
worksheet by using the R1C1 cell notation system, you’d actually see that, 
in R1C1 notation (unlike the default A1 system), each and every copy of the 
original formula is exactly the same.

Copying Formulas
For example, the original formula that I input into cell B8 (known as cell 
R8C2 in the R1C1 system) to sum the April 2010 sales for all the different 
part numbers reads as follows when you switch to R1C1 notation:
=SUM(R[–4]C:R[–1]C)
In this notation, the SUM formula is more difficult to decipher, so I will 
explain and then translate it for you. In R1C1 notation, the cell range in the 
SUM argument is expressed in terms completely relative to the position of 
the cell containing the formula. The row portion of the cell range expresses 
how many rows above or below the one with the formula the rows are (nega-
tive integers indicate rows above, while positive integers indicate rows 
below). The column portion of the cell range in the SUM argument expresses 
how many columns to the left or right of the one with the formula the col-
umns are (positive integers indicate columns to the right and negative 
integers columns to the left). When a column or row in the cell range is not 
followed by an integer in square brackets, this means that there is no change 
in the column or row.
Armed with this information, my translation R1C1 form of this formula may 
just make sense; it says, “sum the values in the range of the cells that is four 
rows (R[–4]) above the current cell in the same column (C) down through 
the cell that is just one row (R[–1]) above the current cell in the same 
column (C).” When this original formula is copied over to the columns in 
the rest of the table, it doesn’t need to be changed because each copy of the 
formula performs this exact calculation (when expressed in such relative 
terms).
The original formula in cell K4 (R4C11 in R1C1-speak) appears as follows 
when you switch over to the R1C1 notation:
=SUM(RC[–9]:RC[–1])
It says, “sum the range of values in the cell nine columns to the left (C[–9]) 
in the same row through the cell that is one column to the left (C[–1]) in the 
same row.” This is exactly what all the copies of this formula in the three 
rows below it do, so that when Excel copies this formula it doesn’t change.
 
You can use the R1C1 notation to check that you’ve copied all the formulas 
in a spreadsheet table correctly. Just switch to the R1C1 system by selecting 
the R1C1 Reference Style check box in the Working with Formulas section on 
the Formulas tab of the Excel Options dialog box (File➪Options➪Formulas). 
Then move the cell cursor through all the cells with copied formulas in 
the table. When R1C1 notation is in effect, all copies of an original formula 
across an entire row or down an entire column of the table should be identi-
cal when displayed on the Formula bar as you make their cells current.

Absolute references
Most of the time, relative cell references are exactly what you need in the 
formulas that you build, thus allowing Excel to adjust the row and/or column 
references as required in the copies that you make. You will encounter some 
circumstances, however, where Excel should not adjust one or more parts of 
the cell reference in the copied formula. This occurs, for example, whenever 
you want to use a cell value as a constant in all the copies that you make of a 
formula.
Figure 1-7 illustrates just such a situation. In this situation, you want to 
build a formula in cell B10 that calculates what percentage April’s part pro-
duction total (B8) is of the total nine-month production (cell K8). Normally, 
you would create the following formula in cell B10 with all its relative cell 
references:
=B8/K8
However, because you want to copy this formula across to the range C10:J10 
to calculate the percentages for the eight months (May through December), 
you need to alter the relative cell references in the last part of the formula 
in cell K8 so that this cell reference with the nine-month production total 
remains unchanged in all your copies.
 
Figure 1-7:

address in

314
Copying Formulas
You can start to understand the problem caused by adjusting a relative cell 
reference that should remain unchanged by just thinking about copying the 
original formula from cell B10 to C10 to calculate the percentage for May. 
In this cell, you want the following formula that divides the May production 
total in cell C8 by the nine-month total in cell K8:
=C8/K8
However, if you don’t indicate otherwise, Excel adjusts both parts of the for-
mula in the copies, so that C10 incorrectly contains the following formula:
=C8/L8
Because cell L8 is currently blank and blank cells have the equivalent of the 
value 0, this formula returns the #DIV/0 formula error as the result, thus indi-
cating that Excel can’t properly perform this arithmetic operation (see Book 
III, Chapter 2 for details on this error message).
To indicate that you don’t want a particular cell reference (such as cell K8 
in the example) to be adjusted in the copies that you make of a formula, you 
change the cell reference from a relative cell reference to an absolute cell 
reference. In the A1 system of cell references, an absolute cell reference con-
tains dollar signs before the column letter and the row number, as in $K$8. 
In the R1C1 notation, you simply list the actual row and column number in 
the cell reference, as in R8C11, without placing the row and column numbers 
in square brackets.
If you realize that you need to convert a relative cell reference to an absolute 
reference as you’re building the original formula, you can convert the rela-
tive reference to absolute by selecting the cell and then pressing F4. To get 
an idea of how this works, follow along with these steps for creating the cor-
rect formula =B7/$K$8 in cell B10:
 
1. Click cell B10 to make it active.
 
2. Type = to start the formula; then click cell B8 and type / (the sign for 
division).
 
 The Formula bar now reads =B8/.
 
3. Click K8 to select this cell and add it to the formula.
 
 The Formula bar now reads =B8/K8.
 
4. Press F4 once to change the cell reference from relative (K8) to abso-
lute ($K$8).
 
 The Formula bar now reads =B8/$K$8. You’re now ready to enter the for-
mula and then make the copies.
 
5. Click the Enter button on the Formula bar and then drag the Fill 
handle to cell J10 before you release the mouse button.

Book III
Chapter 1
Building Basic 
Formulas
315
Copying Formulas
Like it or not, you won’t always anticipate the need for an absolute value 
until after you’ve built the formula and copied it to a range. When this hap-
pens, you have to edit the original formula, change the relative reference to 
absolute, and then make the copies again.
When editing the cell reference in the formula, you can change its reference 
by positioning the insertion point anywhere in its address and then press-
ing F4. You can also do this by inserting dollar signs in front of the column 
letter(s) and row number when editing the formula, although doing that isn’t 
nearly as easy as pressing F4.
 
You can make an exact copy of a formula in another cell without using abso-
lute references. To do this, make the cell with the formula that you want to 
copy the active one, use the I-beam pointer to select the entire formula in 
the Formula bar by dragging through it, and then click the Copy command 
button on the Home tab of the Ribbon (or press Ctrl+C). Next, click the 
Cancel button to deactivate the Formula bar, select the cell where you want 
the exact copy to appear, and then click the Paste command button on the 
Home tab (or press Ctrl+V). Excel then pastes an exact duplicate of the origi-
nal formula into the active cell without adjusting any of its cell references 
(even if they are all relative cell references).
A mixed bag of references
Some formulas don’t require you to change the entire cell reference from 
relative to absolute in order to copy them correctly. In some situations, 
you only need to indicate that the column letter or the row number remains 
unchanged in all copies of the original formula. A cell reference that is part 
relative and part absolute is called a mixed cell reference.
In the A1 notation, a mixed cell reference has a dollar sign just in front of the 
column letter or row number that should not be adjusted in the copies. For 
example, $C10 adjusts row 10 in copies down the rows but leaves column 
C unchanged in all copies across columns to its right. Another example is 
C$10, which adjusts column C in copies to columns to the right but leaves 
row 10 unchanged in all copies down the rows. (For an example of using 
mixed cell references in a master formula, refer to the information on using 
the PMT Function in Book III, Chapter 4.)
To change the cell reference that you select in a formula (by clicking the 
flashing insertion point somewhere in its column letter and row number) 
from relative to mixed, continue to press F4 until the type of mixed reference 
appears on the Formula bar. When the Formula bar is active and the inser-
tion point is somewhere in the cell reference (either when building or editing 
the formula), pressing F4 cycles through each cell-reference possibility in 
the following order:
 
✦ The first time you press F4, Excel changes the relative cell reference to 
absolute (C10 to $C$10).

316
Adding Array Formulas
 
✦ The second time you press F4, Excel changes the absolute reference to 
a mixed reference where the column is relative and the row is absolute 
($C$10 to C$10).
 
✦ The third time you select the Reference command, Excel changes the 
mixed reference where the column is relative and the row is absolute to 
a mixed reference where the row is relative and the column is absolute 
(C$10 to $C10).
 
✦ The fourth time you press F4, Excel changes the mixed reference where 
the row is relative and the column is absolute back to a relative refer-
ence ($C10 to C10).
If you bypass the type of cell reference that you want to use, you can return 
to it by continuing to press F4 until you cycle through the variations again to 
reach the one that you need.
Adding Array Formulas
As noted previously in this chapter, many spreadsheet tables use an origi-
nal formula that you copy to adjacent cells by using relative cell references 
(sometimes referred to as a one-to-many copy). In some cases, you can build 
the original formula so that Excel performs the desired calculation not only 
in the active cell, but also in all the other cells to which you would normally 
copy the formula. You do this by creating an array formula. An array for-
mula is a special formula that operates on a range of values. If a cell range 
supplies this range (as is often the case), it is referred to as an array range. 
If this range is supplied by a list of numerical values, they are known as an 
array constant.
Although the array concept may seem foreign at first, you are really quite 
familiar with arrays because the column-and-row structure of the Excel 
worksheet grid naturally organizes your data ranges into one-dimensional 
and two-dimensional arrays (1-D arrays take up a single row or column, 
whereas 2-D arrays take up multiple rows and columns).
Figure 1-8 illustrates a couple of two-dimensional arrays with numerical 
entries of two different sizes. The first array is a 3 x 2 array in the cell range 
B2:C4. This array is a 3 x 2 array because it occupies three rows and two col-
umns. The second array is a 2 x 3 array in the cell range F2:H3. This array is 
a 2 x 3 array because it uses two rows and three columns.
If you were to list the values in the first 3 x 2 array as an array constant in a 
formula, they would appear as follows:
{1,4;2,5;3,6}
Several things in this list are noteworthy. First, the array constant is enclosed 
in a pair of braces ({}). Second, columns within each row are separated by 

Book III
Chapter 1
Building Basic 
Formulas
317
Adding Array Formulas
commas (,) and rows within the array are separated by semicolons (;). Third, 
the constants in the array are listed across each row and then down each 
column, and not down each column and across each row.
 
Figure 1-8: 
Worksheet 
with two 
different 
sizes of 
arrays.
 
The second 2 x 3 array expressed as an array constant appears as follows:
{7,8,9;10,11,12}
Note again that you list the values across each row and then down each 
column, separating the values in different columns with commas and the 
values in different rows with a semicolon.
The use of array formulas can significantly reduce the amount of formula 
copying that you have to do in a worksheet by producing multiple results 
throughout the array range in a single operation. In addition, array formulas 
use less computer memory than standard formulas copied in a range. This 
can be important when creating a large worksheet with many tables because 
it may mean the difference between fitting all your calculations on one work-
sheet and having to split your model into several worksheet files.
Building an array formula
To get an idea of how you build and use array formulas in a worksheet, 
consider the sample worksheet shown in Figure 1-9. This worksheet is 
designed to compute the biweekly wages for each employee. It will do 

318
Adding Array Formulas
this by multiplying each employee’s hourly rate by the number of hours 
worked in each pay period. Instead of creating the following formula in cell 
R10, you must copy down the cells R11 through R13:
=A4*R4
 
Figure 1-9: 
Building 
an array 
formula to 
calculate 
hourly 
wages for 
the first pay 
period.
 
You can create the following array formula in the array range:
={A4:A7*R4:R7}
This array formula multiplies each of the hourly rates in the 4 x 1 array 
in the range A4:A7 with each of the hours worked in the 4 x 1 array in the 
range R4:R7. This same formula is entered into all cells of the array range 
(R10:R13) as soon as you complete the formula in the active cell R10. To 
see how this is done, follow along with the steps required to build this 
array formula:
 
1. Make cell R10 the current cell, and then select the array range 
R10:R13 and type = (equal sign) to start the array formula.
 
 You always start an array formula by selecting the cell or cell range 
where the results are to appear. Note that array formulas, like standard 
formulas, begin with the equal sign.

Book III
Chapter 1
Building Basic 
Formulas
319
Adding Array Formulas
 
2. Select the range A4:A7 that contains the hourly rate for each 
employee as shown, type an * (asterisk for multiplication), and then 
select the range R4:R7 that contains the total number of hours worked 
during the first pay period.
 
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to insert an array formula in the array range.
 
 When you press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to complete the formula, Excel inserts 
braces around the formula and copies the array formula {=A4:A7*R4:R7} 
into each of the cells in the array range R10:R13.
 
When entering an array formula, you must remember to press 
Ctrl+Shift+Enter instead of just the Enter key because this special key combi-
nation that tells Excel that you are building an array formula, so that the pro-
gram encloses the formula in braces and copies it to every cell in the array 
range. Also, don’t try to create an array formula by editing it on the Formula 
bar and then inserting curly braces because this doesn’t cut it. The only way 
to create an array formula is by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter to complete the 
formula entry.
Figure 1-10 shows you the February wage table after completing all the array 
formulas in three ranges: R10:R13, AI10:AI13, and AJ10:AJ13. In the second 
cell range, AI10:AI13, I entered the following array formula to calculate the 
hourly wages for the second pay period in February:
{=A4:A7*AI4:AI7}
 
Figure 1-10: 
The hourly 
wage 
spreadsheet 
after 
entering all 
three array 
formulas.
 

320
Range Names in Formulas
In the third cell range, AJ10:AJ13, I entered the following array formula to 
calculate the total wages paid to each employee in February 2003:
{=R10:R13+AI10:AI13}
 
When you enter an array formula, the formula should produce an array with 
the same dimensions as the array range that you selected. If the resulting 
array returned by the formula is smaller than the array range, Excel expands 
the resulting array to fill the range. If the resulting array is larger than the 
array range, Excel doesn’t display all the results. When expanding the results 
in an array range, Excel considers the dimensions of all the arrays used in 
the arguments of the operation. Each argument must have the same number 
of rows as the array with the most rows and the same number of columns as 
the array with the most columns.
Editing an array formula
Editing array formulas differs somewhat from editing normal formulas. In 
editing an array range, you must treat the range as a single unit and edit it 
in one operation (corresponding to the way in which the array formula was 
entered). This means that you can’t edit, clear, move, insert, or delete indi-
vidual cells in the array range. If you try, Excel will display an Alert dialog 
box stating “You cannot change part of an array.”
To edit the contents of an array formula, select a cell in the array range 
and then activate Edit mode by clicking the formula or the Formula bar or 
pressing F2. When you do this, Excel displays the contents of the array for-
mula without the customary braces. The program also outlines the ranges 
referred to in the array formula in the cells of the worksheet in different 
colors that match those assigned to the range addresses in the edited for-
mula on the Formula bar. After you make your changes to the formula con-
tents, you must remember to press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to enter your changes 
and have Excel enclose the array formula in braces once again.
If you want to convert the results in an array range to their calculated 
values, select the array range and click the Copy button on the Ribbon’s 
Home tab or press Ctrl+C. Then, without changing the selection, click 
the Paste Values option on the Paste button’s drop-down menu (or press 
Alt+HVV). As soon as you convert an array range to its calculated values, 
Excel no longer treats the cell range as an array.
Range Names in Formulas
Thus far, all the example formulas in this chapter have used a combina-
tion of numerical constants and cell references (both relative and absolute 
and using the A1 and R1C1 notation). Although cell references provide a 
convenient method for pointing out the cell location in the worksheet grid, 

Book III
Chapter 1
Building Basic 
Formulas
321
Range Names in Formulas
they are not at all descriptive of their function when used in formulas. 
Fortunately, Excel makes it easy to assign descriptive names to the cells, cell 
ranges, constants, and even formulas that make their function in the work-
sheet much more understandable.
To get an idea of how names can help to document the purpose of a formula, 
consider the following formula for computing the sale price of an item that 
uses standard cell references:
=B4*B2
Now consider the following formula that performs the same calculation but, 
this time, with the use of range names:
=Retail_Price*Discount_Rate
Obviously, the function of the second formula is much more comprehen-
sible, not only to you as the creator of the worksheet but also to anyone else 
who has to use it.
 
Range names are extremely useful not only for documenting the function of 
the formulas in your worksheet, but also for finding and selecting cell ranges 
quickly and easily. This is especially helpful in a large worksheet that you 
aren’t very familiar with or only use intermittently. After you assign a name 
to a cell range, you can locate and select all the cells in that range with the 
Go To dialog box. Simply click the Go To option on the Find & Select but-
ton’s drop-down menu on the Home tab of the Ribbon (or press Ctrl+G or 
F5). Then double-click the range name in the Go To list box, or click the 
range name and click OK or press Enter. Excel then selects the entire range 
and, if necessary, shifts the worksheet display so that you can see the first 
cell in that range on the screen.
Defining range names
You can define a name for the selected cell range or nonadjacent selection 
by typing its range name into the Name box on the Formula bar and then 
pressing Enter. You can also name a cell, cell range, or nonadjacent selection 
by clicking the Define Name command button on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab 
or by pressing Alt+MMD. Excel then opens the New Name dialog box, where 
you can input the selection’s range name in the Name text box.
If Excel can identify a label in the cell immediately above or to the left of 
the active one, the program inserts this label as the suggested name in the 
Name text box. The program also displays the scope of the range name in 
the Scope drop-down list box and the cell reference of the active cell or the 
range address of the range or nonadjacent selection that is currently marked 
(by using absolute references) in the Refers To text box below. You can do 
the following:

322
Range Names in Formulas
 
✦ To change the scope from the entire workbook to a particular worksheet 
in the workbook so that range name is only recognized on that sheet, 
click the sheet’s name on the Scope drop-down list.
 
✦ To change the cell range the name refers to, select the cells in the work-
sheet (remember you can collapse the New Name dialog box to the 
Refers To text box by clicking its Collapse button).
 
✦ To accept the suggested or edited name, scope, and cell selection, click 
the OK button, shown in Figure 1-11.
 
Figure 1-11: 
Adding a 
new range 
name in the 
New Name 
dialog box.
 
 
When naming a range in the Name text box of the New Name dialog box, you 
need to follow the same naming conventions as when defining a name in 
the Name box on the Formula bar. Basically, this means that the name must 
begin with a letter rather than a number, contain no spaces, and not dupli-
cate any other name in the workbook (see Book II, Chapter 2 for more on 
naming ranges).
If you want to assign the same range name to similar ranges on differ-
ent worksheets in the workbook, preface the range name with the sheet 
name followed by an exclamation point and then the descriptive name. For 
example, if you want to give the name Costs to the cell range A2:A10 on 
both Sheet1 and Sheet2, you name the range Sheet1!Costs on Sheet1 and 
Sheet2!Costs on Sheet2. If you have renamed the worksheet to something 
more descriptive than Sheet1, you need to enclose the name in single quotes 
if it contains a space when you enter the range. For example, if you rename 
Sheet1 to Inc. Statement 04, you enter the range name including the work-
sheet reference for the Costs cell range as follows:
 ‘Inc. Statement 04’!Costs
 
When you preface a range name with the sheet name as shown in this exam-
ple, you don’t have to use the sheet name part of the range name in the for-
mulas that you create on the same worksheet. In other words, if you create 
a SUM formula that totals the values in the ‘Inc. Statement 04’!Costs range 
somewhere on the Inc. Statement 04 worksheet, you can enter the formulas 
as follows:
=SUM(Costs)

Book III
Chapter 1
Building Basic 
Formulas
323
Range Names in Formulas
However, if you were to create this formula on any other worksheet in the 
workbook, you would have to include the full range name in the formula, as in
=SUM(‘Inc. Statement 04’!Costs)
Naming constants and formulas
In addition to naming cells in your worksheet, you can also assign range 
names to the constants and formulas that you use often. For example, if you 
are creating a spreadsheet table that calculates sales prices, you can assign 
the discount percentage rate to the range name discount_rate. Then, you 
can supply this range name as a constant in any formula that calculates the 
sale discount used in determining the sale price for merchandise.
Figure 1-12 illustrates how you would assign a constant value to the range 
name discount_rate. Here, you see the New Name dialog box after I entered 
discount_rate as the name in the Name text box and =15% as the discount 
rate in the Refers To text box. After assigning this constant percentage rate 
to the range name discount_rate in this manner, you can apply it to any 
formula by typing or pasting in the name (see the “Using names in building 
formulas” section that follows in this chapter for details).
In addition to naming constants, you can also give a range name to a formula 
that you use repeatedly. When building a formula in the Refers To text box of 
the New Name dialog box (Alt+MGR), keep in mind that Excel automatically 
applies absolute references to any cells that you point to in the worksheet. If 
you want to create a formula with relative cell references that Excel adjusts 
when you enter or paste the range name in a new cell, you must press F4 to 
convert the current cell reference to relative or type in the cell address with-
out dollar signs.
 
Figure 1-12:

rate

name in the

dialog box.
 
 
When creating the constant in the New Name dialog box, don’t change the 
Scope setting from Workbook to a particular sheet in the workbook unless 
you’re positive that you’ll never need to use that constant in a formula on 
any other worksheet. If you limit the scope to a particular worksheet, Excel 
2010 does not let you use the range name in a formula on any other 

324
Range Names in Formulas
worksheet (you’ll get the #NAME? error), and Scope is the one aspect you 
can’t change when editing a range name via the Name Manager. (I discuss 
managing range names later in this chapter).
Using names in building formulas
After you assign a name to a cell or cell range in your worksheet, you can 
then click the range name on the Use in Formula button’s drop-down list 
on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab to paste it into the formulas that you build 
(Alt+MS).
For example, in the sample Sales Price table shown in Figure 1-13, after 
assigning the discount rate of 15% to the range name, discount_rate, you can 
create the formulas that calculate the amount of the sale discount. To do 
this, you multiply the retail price of each item by the discount_rate constant 
using the Use in Formula command button by following these steps:
 
1. Make cell D3 active.
 
2. Type = (equal sign) to start the formula.
 
3. Click cell C3 to select the retail price for the first item and then type * 
(asterisk).
 
 The formula on the Formula bar now reads, =C3*.
 
4. Click the Use in Formula button on the Formulas tab or press Alt+MS.
 
 This action opens the drop-down menu on the Use in Formula button on 
which you can select the discount_rate range name.
 
5. Click the name discount_rate in the Use in Formula button’s drop-
down menu.
 
 The formula now reads =C3*discount_rate on the Formula bar.
 
6. Click the Enter button on the Formula bar to input the formula in 
cell D3.
 
 Now, all that remains is to copy the original formula down column D.
 
7. Drag the Fill handle in cell D3 down to cell D7 and release the mouse 
button to copy the formula and calculate the discount for the entire 
table.
Creating names from column and row headings
You can use the Create from Selection command button on the Formulas tab 
of the Ribbon to assign existing column and row headings in a table of data 
to the cells in that table. When using this command button, you can have 
Excel assign the labels used as column headings in the top or bottom row 
of the table, the labels used as row headings in the leftmost or rightmost 
column, or even a combination of these headings.

For example, the sample worksheet in Figure 1-14 illustrates a typical table

in the table by using the Create from Selection command button as follows:
 
1. Select the cells in the table, including those with the column and row 
labels that you want to use as range names.
 
 For the example shown in Figure 1-14, you select the range B2:E7.
 
2. Click the Create from Selection command button on the Formulas tab 
or press Alt+MC.
 
 This action opens the Create Names from Selection dialog box that con-
tains four check boxes: Top Row, Left Column, Bottom Row, and Right 
Column. The program selects the check box or boxes in this dialog box 
based on the arrangement of the labels in your table. In the example 
shown in Figure 1-14, Excel selects both the Top Row and Left Column 
check boxes because the table contains both column headings in the top 
row and row headings in the left column.
 
3. After selecting (or deselecting) the appropriate Create Names In check 
boxes, click the OK button to assign the range names to your table.
Note that when you select both the Top Row and Left Column check boxes 
in the Create Names dialog box, Excel assigns the label in the cell in the 
upper-left corner of the table to the entire range of values in the table (one 
row down and one column to the right).

In the example illustrated in Figure 1-14, Excel assigns the name Description 
(the heading for column B) to the cell range C3:E7. Similarly, the program 
assigns the column headings to the appropriate data in the table in the rows 
below, and assigns the row headings to the data in the appropriate columns 
to the right so that the name Retail_Price is assigned to the cell range C3:C7 
and the name China_Hutch is assigned to the cell range C7:E7.
Managing range names
As you assign range names in your workbook, their names appear in the 
Name Manager dialog box (see Figure 1-15). You open this dialog box by 
clicking the Name Manager command button on the Formulas tab of the 
Ribbon or by pressing Alt+MN.
The Name Manager enables you to do any of the following:
 
✦ Create new range names for the worksheet or workbook in the New 
Name dialog box opened by clicking the New button (see “Defining range 
names” earlier in this chapter).
 
✦ Edit existing range names in the Edit Name dialog box by clicking the 
name in the list box and then clicking the Edit button — you can change 
both the name and cell selection when editing a range name.
 
✦ Delete existing range names by clicking the name and then clicking the 
Delete button followed by the OK button in the alert dialog box asking 
you to confirm its deletion.

✦ Filter the range names in the list box of the Name Manager by click-
ing the Filter button and then clicking a filter option (Names Scoped to 
Worksheet, Names Scoped to Workbook, Names with Errors, Names 
without Errors, Defined Names, or Table Names) on its drop-down 
menu.
 
Be careful that you don’t delete a range name that is already used in formu-
las in the worksheet. If you do, Excel will return the #NAME! error value to 
any formula that refers to the name you deleted!

Applying names to existing formulas
Excel doesn’t automatically replace cell references with the descriptive 
names that you assign to them in the New Name or Create Names from 
Selection dialog boxes. To replace cell references with their names, you need 
to click the Apply Names option on the Name a Range button’s drop-down 
menu or press Alt+MGA.
When you choose this command, Excel opens the Apply Names dialog box, 
where you select the range names that you want applied in formulas used in 
your worksheet by selecting the names in the Apply Names list box.
Note that when you first open this dialog box, it contains just two check 
boxes: Ignore Relative/Absolute and Use Row and Column Names (both of 
which are checked). You can click the Options button to expand the Apply 
Names dialog box and display other options that you can use when applying 
your range names, shown in Figure 1-16. The Apply Names options include 
the following:
 
✦ Ignore Relative/Absolute check box: The program replaces cell refer-
ences with the names that you’ve selected in the Apply Names list box, 
regardless of the type of reference used in their formulas. If you want 

328
Range Names in Formulas
Excel to replace only those cell references that use the same type of 
references as are used in your names (absolute for absolute, mixed for 
mixed, and relative for relative), deselect this check box. Most of the 
time, you’ll want to leave this check box selected because Excel auto-
matically assigns absolute cell references to the names that you define 
and relative cell references to the formulas that you build.
 
✦ Use Row and Column Names check box: The names created from row 
and column headings with the Create Names command appear in your 
formulas. Deselect this option if you don’t want these row and column 
names to appear in the formulas in your worksheet.
 
✦ Omit Column Name If Same Column check box: This prevents Excel 
from repeating the column name when the formula is in the same 
column. Deselect this check box when you want the program to display 
the column name even in formulas in the same column as the heading 
used to create the column name.
 
✦ Omit Row Name If Same Row check box: This prevents Excel from 
repeating the row name when the formula is in the same row. Deselect 
this check box when you want the program to display the row name 
even in formulas in the same row as the heading used to create the row 
name.
 
✦ Name Order: Choose the Row Column option button (the default) if you 
want the row name to precede the column name when both names are 
displayed in the formulas, or choose the Column Row option button if 
you want the column name to precede the row name.
After applying all the range names by using the default Apply Names 
options (that is, Ignore Relative/Absolute, Use Row and Column Names, 
Omit Column Name If Same Column, Omit Row Name If Same Row, and 
Name Order options selected), Excel replaces all the cell references in 
the formulas in the Sale Price table. In cell E3, for example, in place of the 
original formula, =C3–D3, the cell now contains the formula:
=Retail_Price–Discount
Cell D3, to the immediate left, instead of =C3*discount_rate now contains:
=Retail_Price*discount_rate
Only one problem occurs with applying names by using the default settings. 
This problem begins to show up as soon as you select cell E4. Although this 
formula subtracts cell D4 from C4, its contents now also appear as
=Retail_Price–Discount
This is identical in appearance to the contents of cell E3 above (and, in fact, 
identical in appearance to cells E5, E6, and E7 in the cells below).

The reason that the formulas all appear identical (although they’re really 
not) is because I selected the Omit Column Name If Same Column and Omit 
Row Name If Same Row check boxes. When you use these settings, Excel 
doesn’t bother to repeat the row name when the formula is in the same row, 
and Excel repeats the column name when the formula is in the same column.
If you were to deselect the Omit Row Name if Same Row check box while 
still selecting the Use Row and Column Name check box in the Apply Names 
dialog box, the formula in cell E3 would appear as follows:
=Table  Retail_Price–Dining-Table  Discount
If you were then to select cell E4 below, the formula would now appear quite 
differently in this form:
=Side_Chair  Retail_Price–Side_Chair  Discount
Now Excel displays both the row and column names separated by a space 
for each cell reference in the formulas in this column. Remember that the 
space between the row name and column name is called the intersection 
operator (see Table 1-1). You can interpret the formula in E3 as saying, “Take 
the cell at the intersection of the Table row and Retail_Price column and 
subtract it from the cell at the intersection of the Table row and Discount 
column.” The formula in E4 is similar, except that it says, “Take the cell at 

330
Adding Linking Formulas
the intersection of the Side_chair row and Retail_Price column and sub-
tract it from the cell at the intersection of the Side_chair row and Discount 
column.”
Adding Linking Formulas
Linking formulas are formulas that transfer a constant or other formula to a 
new place in the same worksheet, same workbook, or even a different work-
book without copying it to its new location. When you create a linking for-
mula, it brings forward the constant or original formula to a new location so 
that the result in the linking formula remains dynamically tied to the original. 
If you change the original constant or any of the cells referred to in the origi-
nal formula, the result in the cell containing the linking formula is updated at 
the same time as the cell containing the original constant or formula.
You can create a linking formula in one of two ways:
 
✦ Select the cell where you want the linking formula, type = (equal sign), 
and then click the cell with the constant (text or number) or the formula 
that you want to bring forward to that cell. Complete the cell entry by 
clicking the Enter button on the Formula bar or pressing the Enter key.
 
✦ Select the cell with the constant or formula that you want to bring 
forward to a new location, and click the Copy button in the Clipboard 
group on the Ribbon’s Home tab or press Ctrl+C. Then click the cell 
where the linking formula is to appear before you click the Paste Link 
option on the Paste button’s drop-down menu.
When you use the first simple formula method to create a link, Excel uses 
a relative cell reference to refer to the cell containing the original value or 
formula (as in =A10 when referring to an entry in cell A10). However, when 
you use the second copy-and-paste link method, Excel uses an absolute cell 
reference to refer to the original cell (as in =$A$10 when referring to an entry 
in cell A10).
When you create a linking formula to a cell on a different sheet of the same 
workbook, Excel inserts the worksheet name (followed by an exclamation 
point) in front of the cell address. So, if you copy and paste a link to a for-
mula in cell A10 on a different worksheet called Income 05, Excel inserts the 
following linking formula:
=’Income 05’!$A$10
When you create a linking formula to a cell in a different workbook, Excel 
inserts the workbook filename enclosed in square brackets before the name 
of the worksheet, which precedes the cell address. So, if you bring forward 
a formula in cell A10 on a worksheet called Cost Analysis in the Projected 
Income 06 workbook, Excel inserts this linking formula:

Book III
Chapter 1
Building Basic 
Formulas
331
Controlling Formula Recalculation
=’[Projected Income 06.xls]Cost Analysis’!$A$10
If you ever need to sever a link between the cell containing the original value 
or formula and the cell to which it’s been brought forward, you can do so 
by editing the linking formula. Press F2, then immediately recalculate the 
formula by pressing F9, and then click the Enter button on the Formula bar 
or press Enter. This replaces the linking formula with the currently calcu-
lated result. Because you’ve converted the dynamic formula into a constant, 
changes to the original cell no longer affect the one to which it was originally 
brought forward.
Controlling Formula Recalculation
Normally, Excel recalculates your worksheet automatically as soon you 
change any entries, formulas, or names on which your formulas depend. 
This system works fine as long as the worksheet is not too large or doesn’t 
contain tables whose formulas depend on several values.
When Excel does calculate your worksheet, the program recalculates only 
those cells that are affected by the change that you’ve made. Nevertheless, 
in a complex worksheet that contains many formulas, recalculation may take 
several seconds (during which time, the pointer will change to an hourglass 
and the word “Recalculation” followed by the number of cells left to be recal-
culated will appear on the left side of the Formula bar).
Because Excel recalculates dependent formulas in the background, you can 
always interrupt this process and make a cell entry or choose a command 
even when the pointer assumes the hourglass shape during the recalculation 
process. As soon as you stop making entries or selecting commands, Excel 
resumes recalculating the worksheet.
To control when Excel calculates your worksheet, you click the Calculation 
Options button on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon and then click the Manual 
option button or press Alt+MXM. After switching to manual recalculation, 
when you make a change in a value, formula, or name that would usually 
cause Excel to recalculate the worksheet, the program displays the message 
“Calculate” on the Status bar.
When you’re ready to have Excel recalculate the worksheet, you then click 
the Calculate Now (F9) command button (the one with a picture of the hand-
held calculator) on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab or press F9 or Ctrl+=. This 
tells the program to recalculate all dependent formulas and open charts and 
makes the Calculate status indicator disappear from the Status bar.
 
After switching to manual recalculation, Excel still automatically recalculates 
the worksheet whenever you save the file. When you are working with a 
really large and complex worksheet, recalculating the worksheet each time 
you want to save your changes can make this process quite time-consuming. 

332
Circular References
If you want to save the worksheet without first updating dependent formulas 
and charts, you need to deselect the Recalculate Workbook before Saving 
check box in the Calculation Options section of the Formulas tab of the Excel 
Options dialog box (File➪Options➪Formulas or Alt+FIF).
 
If your worksheet contains data tables used to perform what-if analyses, 
switch from Automatic to Automatic except Data Tables recalculation by 
clicking Automatic Except Data Tables on the Options button’s drop-down 
menu on the Formulas tab or pressing Alt+MXE. Doing so enables you to 
change a number of variables in the what-if formulas before having Excel 
recalculate the data table (see Book VII, Chapter 1 for more on performing 
what-if analyses).
Automatic, Automatic Except Data Tables, and Manual are by no means the 
only calculation options available in Excel. Table 1-3 explains each of the 
options that appear in the Calculation Options section of the Formulas tab of 
the Excel Options dialog box.

when the Iteration check box is selected.
Circular References
A circular reference in a formula is one that depends, directly or indirectly, 
on its own value. The most common type of circular reference occurs when 
you mistakenly refer in the formula to the cell in which you’re building the 
formula itself. For example, suppose that cell B10 is active when you build 
the formula
=A10+B10
As soon as you click the Enter button on the Formula bar or press Enter or 
an arrow key to insert this formula in cell B10 (assuming the program is in 
Automatic recalculation mode), Excel displays an Alert dialog box, stating 
that it cannot calculate the formula due to the circular reference.
If you then press Enter or click OK to close this Alert dialog box, an Excel 
Help window appears containing general information about circular refer-
ences in two sections: Locate and Remove a Circular Reference and Make a 
Circular Reference Work by Changing the Number of Times Microsoft Excel 
Iterates Formulas.
When you close this Excel Help window by clicking its Close button, Excel 
inserts 0 in the cell with the circular reference, and the Circular Reference 
status indicator followed by the cell address with the circular reference 
appears on the Status bar.
Some circular references are solvable by increasing the number of times 
they are recalculated (each recalculation bringing you closer and closer to 
the desired result), whereas others are not (for no amount of recalculat-
ing brings them closer to any resolution) and need to be removed from the 
spreadsheet.
The formula in cell B10 is an example of a circular reference that Excel is 
unable to resolve because the formula’s calculation depends directly on the 
formula’s result. Each time the formula returns a new result, this result is fed 
into the formula, thus creating a new result to be fed back into the formula. 

334
Circular References
Because this type of circular reference sets up an endless loop that continu-
ously requires recalculating and can never be resolved, you need to fix the 
formula reference or remove the formula from the spreadsheet.
Figure 1-17 illustrates the classic example of a circular reference, which ulti-
mately can be resolved. Here, you have an income statement that includes 
bonuses equal to 20 percent of the net earnings entered as an expense in cell 
B15 with the formula
=–B21*20%
This formula contains a circular reference because it refers to the value in 
B21, which itself indirectly depends on the amount of bonuses (the bonuses 
being used an expense in the formulas that determine the amount of net 
earnings in cell B21).
To resolve the circular reference in cell B15 and calculate the bonuses 
based on net earnings in B21, you simply need to select the Enable Iterative 
Calculation check box in the Calculation Options section of the Formulas 
tab in the Excel Options dialog box (File➪Options➪Formulas or Alt+FIF). 
However, if manual recalculation is selected, you must click the Calculate 
Now (F9) command button on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon or press F9 or 
Ctrl+= as well.

T
roubleshooting the formula errors in a worksheet is the main topic of 
this chapter. Here, you see how to locate the source of all those vexing 
formula errors so that you can shoot them down and set things right! The 
biggest problem with errors in your formulas — besides how ugly such 
values as #REF! and #DIV/0! are — is that they spread like wildfire through 
the workbook to other cells containing formulas that refer to their error-
laden cells. If you’re dealing with a large worksheet in a really big workbook, 
you may not be able to tell which cell actually contains the formula that’s 
causing all the hubbub. And if you can’t apprehend the cell that is the cause 
of all this unpleasantness, you really have no way of restoring law and order 
to your workbook.
Keeping in mind that the best defense is a good offense, you also find out in 
this chapter how to trap potential errors at their source and thereby keep 
them there. This technique, known affectionately as error trapping (just 
think of yourself as being on a spreadsheet safari), is easily accomplished 
by skillfully combining the IF function to combine with the workings of the 
original formula.
Understanding Error Values
If Excel can’t properly calculate a formula that you enter in a cell, the pro-
gram displays an error value in the cell as soon as you complete the formula 
entry. Excel uses several error values, all of which begin with the number 
sign (#). Table 2-1 shows you the error values in Excel along with the mean-
ing and the most probable cause for its display. To remove an error value 
from a cell, you must discover what caused the value to appear and then 
edit the formula so that Excel can complete the desired calculation.

336
Understanding Error Values
Table 2-1 
Error Values in Excel
Error Value
Meaning
Causes
#DIV/0
Division by zero
The division operation in your for-
mula refers to a cell that contains 
the value 0 or is blank.
#N/A
No value available
Technically, this is not an error 
value but a special value that you 
can manually enter into a cell to 
indicate that you don’t yet have a 
necessary value.
#NAME?
Excel doesn’t recog-
nize a name
This error value appears when you 
incorrectly type the range name, 
refer to a deleted range name, 
or forget to put quotation marks 
around a text string in a formula 
(causing Excel to think that you’re 
referring to a range name).
#NULL!
You specified an 
intersection of two 
cell ranges whose 
cells don’t actually 
intersect
Because the space is the intersec-
tion, this error will occur if you 
insert a space instead of a comma 
(the union operator) between 
ranges used in function arguments.
#NUM!
Problem with a 
number in the 
formula
This error can be caused by an 
invalid argument in an Excel func-
tion or a formula that produces a 
number too large or too small to be 
represented in the worksheet.
#REF!
Invalid cell 
reference
This error occurs when you delete 
a cell referred to in the formula or 
if you paste cells over the ones 
referred to in the formula.
#VALUE!
Wrong type of argu-
ment in a function 
or wrong type of 
operator
This error is most often the result of 
specifying a mathematical opera-
tion with one or more cells that 
contain text.
If a formula in your worksheet contains a reference to a cell that returns an 
error value, that formula returns that error value as well. This can cause 
error values to appear throughout the worksheet, thus making it very dif-
ficult for you to discover which cell contains the formula that caused the 
original error value so that you can fix the problem.

Using Logical Functions
Using Logical Functions
Excel uses the following logical functions, which appear on the Logical com-
mand button’s drop-down menu on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon (Alt+ML). 
All the logical functions return either the logical TRUE or logical FALSE to 
their cells when their functions are evaluated. Here are the names of the 
functions along with their argument syntax:
 
✦ AND(logical1,logical2,...) — tests whether the logical arguments are 
TRUE or FALSE. If they are all TRUE, the AND function returns TRUE to 
the cell. If any are FALSE, the AND function returns FALSE.
 
✦ FALSE() — takes no argument and simply enters logical FALSE in its cell.
 
✦ IF(logical_test,value_if_true,value_if_false) — tests whether the logi-
cal_test expression is TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, the IF function uses the 
value_if_true argument and returns it to the cell. If FALSE, the IF function 
uses the value_if_false argument and returns it to the cell.
 
✦ IFERROR(value,value_if_error) — returns the value argument when the 
cell referred to in another logical argument in which the IFERROR func-
tion is used doesn’t contain an error value and the value_if_error argu-
ment when it does.
 
✦ NOT(logical) — tests whether the logical argument is TRUE or FALSE. 
If TRUE, the NOT function returns FALSE to the cell. IF FALSE, the NOT 
function returns TRUE to the cell.
 
✦ OR(logical1,logical2,...) — tests whether the logical arguments are 
TRUE or FALSE. If any are TRUE, the OR function returns TRUE. If all are 
FALSE, the OR function returns FALSE.
 
✦ TRUE() — takes no argument and simply enters logical TRUE in its cell.
The logical_test and logical arguments that you specify for these logical func-
tions usually employ the comparison operators (=, <, >, <=, >=, or <>), which 
themselves return logical TRUE or logical FALSE values. For example, sup-
pose that you enter the following formula in your worksheet:
=AND(B5=D10,C15>=500)
In this formula, Excel first evaluates the first logical argument to determine 
whether the contents in cell B5 and D10 are equal to each other. If they are, 
the first comparison returns TRUE. If they are not equal to each other, this 
comparison returns FALSE. The program then evaluates the second logical 
argument to determine whether the content of cell C15 is greater than or 
equal to 500. If it is, the second comparison returns TRUE. If it is not greater 
than or equal to 500, this comparison returns FALSE.

338
Error-Trapping Formulas
After evaluating the comparisons in the two logical arguments, the AND func-
tion compares the results: If logical argument 1 and logical argument 2 are 
both found to be TRUE, the AND function returns logical TRUE to the cell. 
If, however, either argument is found to be FALSE, the AND function returns 
FALSE to the cell.
When you use the IF function, you specify what’s called a logical_test argu-
ment whose outcome determines whether the value_if_true or value_if_false 
argument is evaluated and returned to the cell. The logical_test argument 
normally uses comparison operators, which return either the logical TRUE 
or logical FALSE value. When the argument returns TRUE, the entry or 
expression in the value_if_true argument is used and returned to the cell. 
When the argument returns FALSE, the entry or expression in the value_if_
false argument is used.
Consider the following formula that uses the IF function to determine 
whether to charge tax on an item:
=IF(E5=”Yes”,D5+D5*7.5%,D5)
If cell E5 (the first cell in the column where you indicate whether the item 
being sold is taxable or not) contains “Yes,” the IF function uses the value_
if_true argument that tells Excel to add the extended price entered in cell 
D5, multiply it by a tax rate of 7.5%, and then add the computed tax to the 
extended price. If, however, cell D5 is blank or contains anything other than 
the text “Yes,” the IF function uses the value_if_false argument, which tells 
Excel to just return the extended price to cell D5 without adding any tax to it.
As you can see, the value_if_true and value_if_false arguments of the IF func-
tion can contain constants or expressions whose results are returned to the 
cell that holds the IF formula.
Error-Trapping Formulas
Sometimes, you know ahead of time that certain error values are unavoidable 
in a worksheet as long as it’s missing certain data. The most common error 
value that gets you into this kind of trouble is our old friend, the #DIV/0! error 
value. Suppose, for example, that you’re creating a new sales workbook from 
your sales template, and one of the rows in this template contains formulas 
that calculate the percentage that each monthly total is of the quarterly 
total. To work correctly, the formulas must divide the value in the cell that 
contains the monthly total by the value in the cell that contains the quarterly 
total. When you start a new sales workbook from its template, the cells that 
contain the formulas for determining the quarterly totals contain zeros, and 
these zeros put #DIV/0! errors in the cells with formulas that calculate the 
monthly/quarterly percentages.

Book III
Chapter 2
Logical Functions 
and Error Trapping
339
Error-Trapping Formulas
These particular #DIV/0! error values in the new workbook don’t really rep-
resent mistakes as such because they automatically disappear as soon as 
you enter some of the monthly sales for each quarter (so that the calculated 
quarterly totals are no longer 0). The problem that you may have is con-
vincing your non–spreadsheet-savvy coworkers (especially the boss) that, 
despite the presence of all these error values in your worksheet, the formu-
las are hunky-dory. All that your coworkers see is a worksheet riddled with 
error values, and these error values undermine your coworkers’ confidence 
in the correctness of your worksheet.
 
Well, I have the answer for just such “perception” problems. Rather than risk 
having your boss freak out over the display of a few little #DIV/0! errors here 
and there, you can set up these formulas so that, whenever they’re tempted 
to return any type of error value (including #DIV/0!), they instead return 
zeros in their cells. Only when absolutely no danger exists of cooking up 
error values will Excel actually do the original calculations called for in the 
formulas.
This sleight of hand in an original formula not only effectively eliminates 
errors from the formula but also prevents their spread to any of its depen-
dents. To create such a formula, you use the IF function, which operates one 
way when a certain condition exists and another when it doesn’t.
To see how you can use the IF function in a formula that sometimes gives 
you a #DIV/0! error, consider the sample worksheet shown in Figure 2-1. 
This figure shows a blank Production Schedule worksheet for storing the 
2010 production figures arranged by month and part number. Because you 
haven’t yet had a chance to input any data into this table, the SUM formulas 
in the last row and column contain 0 values. Because cell K8 with the grand 
total currently also contains 0, all the percent-of-total formulas in the cell 
range B10:J10 contain #DIV/0! error values.
The first percent-of-total formula in cell B9 contains the following:
=B8/$K$8
Because cell K8 with the grand total contains 0, the formula returns the 
#DIV/0! error value. Now, I show you how to set a trap for the error in the 
logical_test argument inside an IF function. After the logical_test argument, 
you enter the value_if_true argument (which is 0 in this example) and the 
value_if_false argument (which is the B7/$K$7). With the addition of the IF 
function, the final formula looks like this:
=IF($K$8=0,0,B8/$K$8)

that’s full 
of #DIV/0! 
errors.
 
This formula then inputs 0 into cell B10, as shown in Figure 2-2, when the for-
mula actually returns the #DIV/0! error value (because cell K8 is still empty 
or has a 0 in it), and returns the percentage of total production when the 
formula doesn’t return the #DIV/0! error value (because cell K8 with the total 
production divisor is no longer empty or contains any other value besides 
0). Next, all you have to do is copy this error-trapping formula in cell B10 
over to J10 to remove all the #DIV/0! errors from this worksheet.
The error-trapping formula created with the IF function in cell B10 works 
fine as long as you know that the grand total in cell K8 will contain either 0 
or some other numerical value. It does not, however, trap any of the various 
error values, such as #REF! and #NAME?, nor does it account for the special 
#NA (Not Available) value. If, for some reason, one of the formulas feeding 
into the SUM formula in K8 returns one of these beauties, they will suddenly 
cascade throughout all the cells with the percent-of-total formulas (cell 
range B10:J10).
To trap all error values in the grand total cell K8 and prevent them from 
spreading to the percent-to-total formulas, you need to add the ISERROR 
function to the basic IF formula. The ISERROR function returns the logical 
value TRUE if the cell specified as its argument contains any type of error 
value, including the special #N/A value (if you use ISERR instead of ISERROR, 
it checks for all types of error values except for #N/A).

errors.
 
To add the ISERROR function, place it in the IF function as the logical_test 
argument. If, indeed, K8 does contain an error value or the #N/A value at 
the time the IF function is evaluated, you specify 0 as the value_if_true argu-
ment so that Excel inputs 0 in cell B10 rather than error value or #N/A. For 
the value_if_false argument, you specify the original IF function that inputs 
0 if the cell K8 contains 0; otherwise, it performs the division that computes 
what percentage the January production figure is of the total production.
This amended formula with the ISERROR and two IF functions in cell B10 
looks like this:
=IF(ISERROR($K$8),0,IF($K$8=0,0,B8/$K$8))
As soon as you copy this original formula to the cell range C10:J10, you’ve 
protected all the cells with the percent-of-total formulas from displaying and 
spreading any of those ugly error values.
 
Some people prefer to remove the display of zero values from any template 
that contains error-trapping formulas so that no one interprets the zeros 
as the correct value for the formula. To remove the display of zeros from a 
worksheet, deselect the Show a Zero in Cells That Have Zero Values check 
box in the Display Options for this Worksheet section of the Advanced tab 
of the Excel Options dialog box (File➪Options or Alt+FI). By this action, the 
cells with error-trapping formulas remain blank until you give them the data 
that they need to return the correct answers!

If you don’t happen to trap those pesky error values before they get out 
into the spreadsheet, you end up having to track down the original cell that 
caused all the commotion and set it right. Fortunately, Excel offers some 
very effective formula-auditing tools for tracking down the cell that’s caus-
ing your error woes by tracing the relationships between the formulas in the 
cells of your worksheet. By tracing the relationships, you can test formulas 
to see which cells, called direct precedents in spreadsheet jargon, directly 
feed the formulas and which cells, called dependents (nondeductible, of 
course), depend on the results of the formulas. Excel even offers a way to 
visually backtrack the potential sources of an error value in the formula of a 
particular cell.
The formula-auditing tools are found in the command buttons located in the 
Formula Auditing group on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon. These command 
buttons include the following:
 
✦ Trace Precedents: When you click this button, Excel draws arrows to 
the cells (the so-called direct precedents) that are referred to in the for-
mula inside the selected cell. When you click this button again, Excel 
adds “tracer” arrows that show the cells (the so-called indirect prec-
edents) that are referred to in the formulas in the direct precedents.
 
✦ Trace Dependents: When you click this button, Excel draws arrows from 
the selected cell to the cells (the so-called direct dependents) that use, or 
depend on, the results of the formula in the selected cell. When you click 
this button again, Excel adds tracer arrows identifying the cells (the 
so-called indirect dependents) that refer to formulas found in the direct 
dependents.
 
✦ Remove Arrows: Clicking this button removes all the arrows drawn, 
no matter what button or pull-down command you used to put them 
there — click the drop-down button attached to this button to display 
a drop-down menu with three options: Remove Arrows to remove all 
arrows (just like clicking the Remove Arrows command button); Remove 
Precedent Arrows to get rid of the arrows that were drawn when you 
clicked the Trace Precedents button; and Remove Dependent Arrows 
to get rid of the arrows that were drawn when you clicked the Trace 
Dependents button.
 
✦ Show Formulas: To display all formulas in their cells in the worksheet 
instead of their calculated values (just like pressing Ctrl+`).
 
✦ Error Checking: When you click this button or click the Error Checking 
option on its drop-down menu, Excel displays the Error Checking dialog 
box, which describes the nature of the error in the current cell, gives 
you help on it, and enables you to trace its precedents. Click the Trace 
Error option on this button’s drop-down menu to attempt to locate the

Formula Auditing
cell that contains the original formula that has an error. Click the Circular 
References option on this button’s drop-down menu to display a con-
tinuation menu with a list of all the cell addresses containing circular 
references in the active worksheet — click a cell address on this menu 
to select the cell with a circular reference formula in the worksheet (see 
Book III, Chapter 1 for more on circular references in formulas).
 
✦ Evaluate Formula: Clicking this button opens the Evaluate Formula 
dialog box, where you can have Excel evaluate each part of the formula 
in the current cell. The Evaluate Formula feature can be quite useful in 
formulas that nest many functions within them.
 
✦ Watch Window: Clicking this button opens the Watch Window dialog 
box, which displays the workbook, sheet, cell location, range name, cur-
rent value, and formula in any cells that you add to the watch list. To 
add a cell to the watch list, click the cell in the worksheet, click the Add 
Watch button in the Watch Window dialog box, and then click Add in the 
Add Watch dialog box that appears.
Clicking the Trace Precedents and Trace Dependents buttons in the Formula 
Auditing group of the Formulas tab on the Ribbon lets you see the relation-
ship between a formula and the cells that directly and indirectly feed it, as 
well as those cells that directly and indirectly depend on its calculation. 
Excel establishes this relationship by drawing arrows from the precedent 
cells to the active cell and from the active cell to its dependent cells.
If these cells are on the same worksheet, Excel draws solid red or blue 
arrows extending from each of the precedent cells to the active cell and from 
the active cell to the dependent cells. If the cells are not located locally on 
the same worksheet (they may be on another sheet in the same workbook or 
even on a sheet in a different workbook), Excel draws a black dotted arrow. 
This arrow comes from or goes to an icon picturing a miniature worksheet 
that sits to one side, with the direction of the arrowheads indicating whether 
the cells on the other sheet feed the active formula or are fed by it.
Tracing precedents
You can click the Trace Precedents command button on the Formulas tab of 
the Ribbon or press Alt+MP to trace all the generations of cells that contrib-
ute to the formula in the selected cell (kinda like tracing all the ancestors in 
your family tree). Figures 2-3 and 2-4 illustrate how you can use the Trace 
Precedents command button or its hot key equivalent to quickly locate the 
cells that contribute, directly and indirectly, to the simple addition formula 
in cell B9.
Figure 2-3 shows the worksheet after I clicked the Trace Precedents com-
mand button the first time. As you can see, Excel draws trace arrows from 
cells A5 and C5 to indicate that they are the direct precedents of the addi-
tion formula in cell B9. In Figure 2-4, you see what happened when I clicked 

344
Formula Auditing
this command button a second time to display the indirect precedents of 
this formula (think of them as being a generation earlier in the family tree). 
The new tracer arrows show that cells A2, A3, and A4 are the direct prec-
edents of the formula in cell A5 — indicated by a border around the three 
cells. (Remember that cell A5 is the first direct precedent of the formula in 
cell B9.) Likewise, cells B2 and B3 as well as cell C2 are the direct precedents 
of the formula in cell C5. (Cell C5 is the second direct precedent of the for-
mula in cell B9.)
Each time you click the Trace Precedents command button, Excel displays 
another (earlier) set of precedents, until no more generations exist. If you 
are in a hurry (as most of us are most of the time), you can speed up the 
process and display both the direct and indirect precedents in one opera-
tion by double-clicking the Trace Precedents command button. To clear the 
worksheet of tracer arrows, click the Remove Arrows command button on 
the Formulas tab.
Figure 2-5 shows what happened after I clicked the Trace Precedents com-
mand button (after clicking it twice before, as shown in Figures 2-3 and 2-4). 
Clicking the command button reveals both the indirect precedents for cell 
C5. The formulas in cells B2 and C2 are the direct precedents of the formula 
in cell C5. The direct precedent of the formula in cell C2 (and, consequently, 
the indirect precedent of the one in cell C5) is not located on this worksheet. 
This fact is indicated by the dotted tracer arrow coming from that cute min-
iature worksheet icon sitting on top of cell A3.

Formula Auditing
To find out exactly which workbook, worksheet, and cell(s) hold the direct 
precedents of cell C2, I double-clicked somewhere on the dotted arrow 
(clicking the icon with the worksheet miniature doesn’t do a thing). Double-
clicking the dotted tracer arrow opens the Go To dialog box, which shows a 
list of all the precedents (including the workbook, worksheet, and cell refer-
ences). To go to a precedent on another worksheet, double-click the refer-
ence in the Go To list box, or select it and click OK. (If the worksheet is in 
another workbook, this workbook file must already be open before you can 
go to it.)
The Go To dialog box, shown in Figure 2-6, displays the following direct prec-
edent of cell C2, which is cell B4 on Sheet2 of the same workbook:
 ‘[Error Tracing.xls]Sheet2’!$B$4
To jump directly to this cell, double-click the cell reference in the Go To 
dialog box.
You can also select precedent cells that are on the same worksheet as the 
active cell by double-clicking somewhere on the cell’s tracer arrow. Excel 
selects the precedent cell without bothering to open up the Go To dialog box.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Double-
clicking 
the dotted 
tracer arrow 
opens the 
Go To dialog 
box showing 
the location.
 
You can use the Special button in the Go To dialog box (see Figure 2-6) to 
select all the direct or indirect precedents or the direct or indirect dependents 
that are on the same sheet as the formula in the selected cell. After opening 
the Go To dialog box (Ctrl+G or F5) and clicking the Special button, you simply 
click the Precedents or Dependents option button and then choose between 
the Direct Only or All Levels option button before you click OK.
Tracing dependents
You can click the Trace Dependents command button in the Formula 
Auditing group of the Formulas tab on the Ribbon or press Alt+MD to trace 
all the generations of cells that either directly or indirectly utilize the for-
mula in the selected cell (kind of like tracing the genealogy of all your

progeny). Tracing dependents with the Trace Dependents command button 
is much like tracing precedents with the Trace Precedents command button. 
Each time you click this button, Excel draws another set of arrows that show 
a generation of dependents further removed. To display both the direct 
and indirect dependents of a cell in one fell swoop, double-click the Trace 
Dependents command button.
Figure 2-7 shows what happened after I selected cell B9 and then double-
clicked the Trace Dependents command button on the Formulas tab of the 
Ribbon to display both the direct and indirect dependents and then clicked 
it a third time to display the dependents on another worksheet.
As this figure shows, Excel first draws tracer arrows from cell B9 to cells C12 
and C13, indicating that C12 and C13 are the direct dependents of cell B9. 
Then, it draws tracer arrows from cells C12 and C13 to E12 and E13, respec-
tively, the direct dependents of C12 and C13 and the indirect dependents of 
B9. Finally, it draws a tracer arrow from cell E12 to another sheet in the work-
book (indicated by the dotted tracer arrow pointing to the worksheet icon).

Error checking
Whenever a formula yields an error value other than #N/A (refer to Table 2-1 
for a list of all the error values) in a cell, Excel displays a tiny error indicator 
(in the form of the triangle) in the upper-left corner of the cell and an alert

options button appears to the left of that cell when you make it active. If 
you position the mouse pointer on that options button, a drop-down button 
appears to its right that you can click to display a drop-down menu, and a 
ScreenTip appears below describing the nature of the error value.
When you click the drop-down button, a menu appears, containing an item 
with the name of the error value followed by the following items:
 
✦ Help on This Error: Opens an Excel Help window with information on 
the type of error value in the active cell and how to correct it.
 
✦ Show Calculation Steps: Opens the Evaluate Formula dialog box where 
you can walk through each step in the calculation to see the result of 
each computation.
 
✦ Ignore Error: Bypasses error checking for this cell and removes the 
error alert and Error options button from it.
 
✦ Edit in Formula Bar: Activates Edit mode and puts the insertion point at 
the end of the formula on the Formula bar.
 
✦ Error Checking Options: Opens the Formulas tab of the Excel Options 
dialog box where you can modify the options used in checking the work-
sheet for formula errors (see “Changing the Error Checking options” sec-
tion that immediately follows for details).
If you’re dealing with a worksheet that contains many error values, you can 
use the Error Checking command button (the one with the check mark on 
top of a red alert exclamation mark) in the Formula Auditing group on the 
Ribbon’s Formulas tab to locate each error.
When you click the Error Checking command button, Excel selects the cell 
with the first error value and opens the Error Checking dialog box (see 
Figure 2-8) that identifies the nature of the error value in the current cell.

Formula Auditing
The command buttons in the Error Checking dialog box directly correspond 
to the menu options that appear when you click the cell’s alert options 
button (except that Error Checking Options on this drop-down menu is 
simply called the Options button in this dialog box).
In addition, the Error Checking dialog box contains Next and Previous but-
tons that you can click to have Excel select the cell with the next error value 
or return to the cell with the previously displayed error value.
 
Note that when you click the Next or Previous button when Excel has flagged 
the very first or last error value in the worksheet, the program displays an 
alert dialog box letting you know that the error check for the worksheet is 
complete. When you click the OK button, Excel closes both the alert dialog 
box and the Error Checking dialog box. Also note that clicking the Ignore 
Error button is the equivalent of clicking the Next button.
Changing the Error Checking options
When you select Error Checking Options on the alert options drop-down 
menu attached to a cell with an error value or click the Options button in 
the Error Checking dialog box, Excel opens the Formulas tab of the Excel 
Options dialog box. This tab displays the Error Checking and Error Checking 
Rules options that are currently in effect in Excel. You can use these options 
on this Formulas tab to control when the worksheet is checked for errors 
and what cells are flagged:
 
✦ Enable Background Error Checking check box: Has Excel check your 
worksheets for errors when the computer is idle. When this check box 
is selected, you can change the color of the error indicator that appears 
as a tiny triangle in the upper-left corner of the cell (normally this indica-
tor is green) by clicking a new color on the Indicate Errors Using This 
Color’s drop-down palette.
 
✦ Reset Ignored Errors button: Restores the error indicator and alert 
options button to all cells that you previously told Excel to ignore by 
choosing the Ignore Error item on the alert options drop-down menu 
attached to the cell.
 
✦ Indicate Errors Using This Color drop-down button: Enables you to 
select a particular color for cells containing error values from the drop-
down palette that appears when you click this button.
 
✦ Cells Containing Formulas That Result in an Error check box: Has 
Excel insert the error indicator and adds the alert options button to all 
cells that return error values.

✦ Inconsistent Calculated Column Formula in Tables check box: Has Excel 
flag formulas in particular columns of cell ranges formatted as tables that 
vary in their computations from the other formulas in the column.
 
✦ Cells Containing Years Represented as 2 Digits check box: Has Excel flag 
all dates entered as text with just the last two digits of the year as errors 
by adding an error indicator and alert options button to their cells.
 
✦ Numbers Formatted as Text or Preceded by an Apostrophe check box: 
Has Excel flag all numbers entered as text as errors by adding an error 
indicator and alert options button to their cells.
 
✦ Formulas Inconsistent with Other Formulas in Region check box: Has 
Excel flag any formula that differs from the others in the same area of 
the worksheet as an error by adding an error indicator and alert options 
button to its cell.
 
✦ Formulas Which Omit Cells in a Region check box: Has Excel flag any 
formula that omits cells from the range that it refers to as an error by 
adding an error indicator and alert options button to its cell.
 
✦ Unlocked Cells Containing Formulas check box: Has Excel flag any 
formula whose cell is unlocked when the worksheet is protected as an 
error by adding an error indicator and alert options button to its cell 
(see Book IV, Chapter 1 for information on protecting worksheets).
 
✦ Formulas Referring to Empty Cells check box: Has Excel flag any for-
mula that refers to blank cells as an error by adding an error indicator 
and alert options button to its cell.
 
✦ Data Entered in a Table Is Invalid check box: Has Excel flag any formu-
las for which you’ve set up Data Validation (see Book II, Chapter 1 for 
details) and that contain values outside of those defined as valid.
Error tracing
Tracing a formula’s family tree, so to speak, with the Trace Precedents and 
Trace Dependents command buttons on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab is fine, 
as far as it goes. However, when it comes to a formula that returns a hideous 
error value, such as #VALUE! or #NAME!, you need to turn to Excel’s trusty 
Trace Error option.
 
Excel gives you a real choice when it comes to accessing the Trace Error 
option. To select this option in the current cell containing an untraced error 
value, you can do any of the following:
 
✦ Click the Trace Error option on the cell’s alert options drop-down menu.
 
✦ Click the Error Checking command button on the Formulas tab of the 
Ribbon and then click the Trace Error button in the Error Checking 
dialog box (see Figure 2-8).
 
✦ Click the Trace Error option on the Error Checking command button’s 
drop-down menu or press Alt+MKE.

Selecting the Trace Error option is a lot like using both the Trace Precedents 
and the Trace Dependents command button options, except that the Trace 
Error option works only when the active cell contains some sort of error 
value returned by either a bogus formula or a reference to a bogus for-
mula. In tracking down the actual cause of the error value in the active cell 
(remember that these error values spread to all direct and indirect depen-
dents of a formula), Excel draws blue tracer arrows from the precedents 
for the original bogus formula and then draws red tracer arrows to all the 
dependents that contain error values as a result.
Figure 2-9 shows the sample worksheet after I made some damaging changes 
that left three cells — C12, E12, and E13 — with #DIV/0! errors (meaning that 
somewhere, somehow, I ended up creating a formula that is trying to divide 
by zero, which is a real no-no in the wonderful world of math). To find the 
origin of these error values and identify its cause, I clicked the Trace Error 
option on the Error Checking command button’s drop-down menu while cell 
E12 was the active cell to engage the use of Excel’s faithful old Trace Error 
feature.
You can see the results in Figure 2-9 (unfortunately without color, so you 
can’t tell which trace arrows were drawn in blue or red). Note that Excel 
has selected cell C12, although cell E12 was active when I selected the Trace 
Error option. To cell C12, Excel has drawn two blue tracer arrows (you’ll 
have to take my word for it about the color) that identify cells B5 and B9 
as its direct precedents. From cell C12, the program has drawn a single red 
tracer arrow from cell C12 to cell E12 that identifies its direct dependent.
When Trace Error loses the trail
The Trace Error option finds errors along the 
path of a formula’s precedents and dependents 
until it finds either the source of the error or 
one of the following problems:
 ✓ It encounters a branch point with more 
than one error source. In this case, Excel 
doesn’t make a determination on its own 
as to which path to pursue.
 ✓ It encounters existing tracer arrows. 
Therefore, always click the Remove 
Arrows command button to get rid of trace 
arrows before you click the Trace Error 
option on the Error Checking button’s drop-
down menu.
 ✓ It encounters a formula with a circular ref-
erence (see Book III, Chapter 1 for more on 
circular references).

As it turns out, Excel’s Trace Error option is right on the money because the 
formula in cell C12 contains the bad apple rotting the whole barrel. I revised the 
formula in cell C12 so that it divided the value in cell B9 by the value in cell B5 
without making sure that cell B5 first contained the SUM formula that totaled 
the values in the cell range B2:B4. The #DIV/0! error value showed up — remem-
ber that an empty cell contains a zero value as if you had actually entered 0 in 
the cell — and immediately spread to cells E12 and E13, which, in turn, use the 
value returned in C12 in their own calculations. Thus, these cells were infected 
with #DIV/0! error values as well.
As soon as you correct the problem in the original formula and thus get rid 
of all the error values in the other cells, Excel automatically converts the 
red tracer arrows (showing the proliferation trail of the original error) to 
regular blue tracer arrows, indicating merely that these restored cells are 
dependents of the formula that once contained the original sin. You can then 
remove all the tracer arrows from the sheet by clicking the Remove Arrows 
command button in the Formula Auditing group of the Ribbon’s Formulas 
tab (or by pressing Alt+MAA).
Evaluating a formula
The Evaluate Formula command button in the Formula Auditing group of the 
Ribbon’s Formulas tab (the one with fx inside a magnifying glass) opens the 
Evaluate Formula dialog box, where you can step through the calculation of

Formula Auditing
a complicated formula to see the current value returned by each part of the 
calculation. This is often helpful in locating problems that prevent the for-
mula from returning the hoped for or expected results.
To evaluate a formula step-by-step, position the cell pointer in that cell and 
then click the Evaluate Formula command button on the Formulas tab (or 
press Alt+MV). This action opens the Evaluate Formula dialog box with an 
Evaluation list box that displays the contents of the entire formula that’s in 
the current cell.
To have Excel evaluate the first expression or term in the formula (shown 
underlined in the Evaluation list box) and replace it with the currently calcu-
lated value, click the Evaluate button. If this expression uses an argument or 
term that is itself a result of another calculation, you can display its expres-
sion or formula by clicking the Step In button (see Figure 2-10) and then cal-
culate its result by clicking the Evaluate button. After that, you can return to 
the evaluation of the expression in the original formula by clicking the Step 
Out button.
 
Figure 2-10: 
Calculating 
each part of 
a formula in 
the Evaluate 
Formula 
dialog box.
 
After you evaluate the first expression in the formula, Excel underlines the 
next expression or term in the formula (by using the natural order of prece-
dence and a strict left-to-right order unless you have used parentheses to 
override this order), which you can then replace with its calculated value 
by clicking the Evaluate button. When you finish evaluating all the expres-
sions and terms of the current formula, you can close the Evaluate Formula 
window by clicking its Close button in the upper-right corner of the window.
 
Instead of the Evaluate Formula dialog box, open the Watch Window dialog 
box by clicking the Watch Window button on the Formulas tab (Alt+MW) and 
add formulas to it when all you need to do is to keep an eye on the current 
value returned by a mixture of related formulas in the workbook. This enables 
you to see the effect that changing various input values has on their calcula-
tions (even when they’re located on different sheets of the workbook).

Removing Errors from the Printout
Removing Errors from the Printout
What if you don’t have the time to trap all the potential formula errors or 
track them down and eliminate them before you have to print out and dis-
tribute the spreadsheet? In that case, you may just have to remove the dis-
play of all the error values before you print the report.
To do this, click the Sheet tab in the Page Setup dialog box opened by click-
ing the dialog box launcher button on the right side of the Page Setup group 
on the Page Layout tab. Click the Sheet tab in the Page Setup dialog box and 
then click the drop-down button attached to the Cell Errors As drop-down 
list box. 
The default value for this drop-down list box is “Displayed,” meaning that all 
error values are displayed in the printout exactly as they currently appear in 
the worksheet. This drop-down menu also contains the following items that 
you can click to remove the display of error values from the printed report:
 
✦ Click the <blank> option to replace all error values with blank cells.
 
✦ Click the -- option to replace all error values with two dashes.
 
✦ Click the #N/A option to replace all error values (except for #N/A 
entries, of course) with the special #N/A value (which is considered an 
error value when you select the <blank> or — options).
 
Blanking out error values or replacing them with dashes or #N/A values has 
no effect on them in the worksheet itself, only in any printout you make of 
the worksheet. You need to view the pages in the Print Preview area in the 
Print Settings panel (Ctrl+P) before you can see the effect of selecting an

reating formulas that use dates and times can be a little confusing if 
you don’t have a good understanding of how Excel treats these types 
of values. After you’re equipped with this understanding, you can begin to 
make good use of the many date and time functions that the program offers.
This chapter begins with a quick overview of date and time numbers in 
Excel and how you can use them to build simple formulas that calculate dif-
ferences between elapsed dates and times. The chapter goes on to survey 
Excel built-in date and time functions, including the date functions that are 
available after you’ve installed and activated the Analysis ToolPak add-in.
Understanding Dates and Times
Excel doesn’t treat the dates and times that you enter in the cells of your 
worksheet as simple text entries (for more information on inputting num-
bers in a spreadsheet, see Book II, Chapter 1). Any entry with a format that 
resembles one of the date and time number formats utilized by Excel is 
automatically converted, behind the scenes, into a serial number. In the 
case of dates, this serial number represents the number of days that have 
elapsed since the beginning of the twentieth century so that January 1, 1900, 
is serial number 1; January 2, 1900, is serial number 2; and so forth. In the 
case of times, this serial number is a fraction that represents the number 
of hours, minutes, and seconds that have elapsed since midnight, which 
is serial number 0.00000000, so that 12:00:00 p.m. (noon) is serial number 
0.50000000; 11:00:00 p.m. is 0.95833333; and so forth.
As long as you format a numeric entry so that it conforms to a recognized 
date or time format, Excel enters it as a date or time serial number. Only 
when you enter a formatted date or time as a text entry (by prefacing it with 
an apostrophe) or import dates and times as text entries into a worksheet

Understanding Dates and Times
do you have to worry about converting them into date and time serial num-
bers, which enables you to build spreadsheet formulas that perform calcula-
tions on them.
Changing the Regional date settings
Excel isn’t set up to automatically recognize European date formats in which 
the number of the day precedes the number of the month and year. For 
example, you may want 6/11/1969 to represent November 6, 1969, rather 
than June 11, 1969. If you’re working with a spreadsheet that uses this type 
of European date system, you have to customize Windows’ Regional settings 
for the United States so that the Short Date format in Windows programs, 
such as Excel and Word 2010, use the D/m/yyyy (day, month, year) format 
rather than the default M/d/yyyy (month, day, year) format.
You can do this by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar and then click Control 
Panel.
 
 The Control Panel window normally opens in Category view. If it is in 
Classic view, switch to Category view by clicking the Control Panel 
Home link in Windows 7 and Vista or the Switch to Category View link in 
Windows XP in the Navigation pane on the left side of the Control Panel 
dialog box.
 
2. Click the Clock, Language, and Region link in the Windows Vista 
Control Panel or click the Date, Time, Language, and Regional Options 
link in the Windows XP Control Panel.
 
3. Click the Regional and Language Options link in the Windows 7 or 
Vista Control Panel or the Change the Format of Numbers, Dates, and 
Times link in the Windows XP Control Panel.
 
 The Regional and Language Options dialog box opens with the Formats 
tab selected in Windows 7 or Vista and the Regional Options tab 
selected in Windows XP.
 
4. In Windows 7 click the Additional Settings button. In Vista, click 
the Customize This Format button at the bottom of the Regional and 
Language Options dialog box. In Windows XP, click the Customize 
button located to the right of your current format setting in the 
Regional and Language Options dialog box.
 
 The Customize Format or Customize Regional Options dialog box opens.
 
5. Click the Date tab in the Customize Regional Options dialog box.
 
6. Click the Short Date format and then type D/m/yyyy, the new date 
format.

 You have to type this European date format because the United States 
regional settings don’t automatically include this format in the Short 
Date Style drop-down list. After manually entering this format, the 
European date format becomes part of the list that you can then select 
from in the future.
 
7. Click OK twice, once to close the Customize Format or Customize 
Regional Options dialog box and then a second time to close the 
Regional and Language Options dialog box.
 
8. Click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the Control Panel 
window or press Alt+F4 to close this window.
After changing the Short Date format in the Windows Control Panel, the 
next time you open Excel, it automatically interprets short dates using the 
D/m/yyyy format; so that, for example, 3/5/04 is May 3, 2004, rather than 
March 5, 2004.
 
Don’t forget to change the Short Date format back to its original M/d/yyyy 
format in the Customize Regional Options dialog box when working with 
spreadsheets that follow the “month-day-year” Short Date format preferred 
in the United States. Also, don’t forget that you have to restart Excel to get 
it to pick up on the changes that you make to the Regional settings in the 
Windows 7 and Vista or XP Control Panel.
Building formulas that calculate elapsed dates
Most of the date formulas that you build are designed to calculate the number 
of days or years that have elapsed between two dates. To do this, you build a 
simple formula that subtracts the earlier date from the later date.
For example, if you input the date 4/25/75 in cell B11 and 6/3/04 in cell C11 
and you want to calculate the number of days that have elapsed between 
April 25, 1975, and June 3, 2004, in cell D11, you would enter the following 
subtraction formula in that cell:
=C11-B11
Excel then inputs 10632 as the number of days between these dates in cell 
D5 using the General number format.
 
If you want the result between two dates expressed in the number of years 
rather than the number of days, divide the result of your subtraction by 
the number of days in a year. In this example, you can enter the formula 
=D11/365 in cell E11 to return the result 29.12877, which you can then round 
off to 29 by clicking the Decrease Decimal button in the Number group on 
the Home tab of the Ribbon or by pressing Alt+H9 until only 29 remains dis-
played in the cell.

358
Using Date Functions
Building formulas that calculate elapsed times
Some spreadsheets require that formulas calculate the amount of elapsed 
time between a starting and ending time. For example, suppose that you 
keep a worksheet that records the starting and stopping times for your 
hourly employees, and you need to calculate the number of hours and min-
utes that elapse between these two times in order to figure their daily and 
monthly wages.
To build a formula that calculates how much time has elapsed between two 
different times of the day, subtract the starting time of day from the ending 
time of day. For example, suppose that you enter a person’s starting time in 
cell B14 and ending time in C14. In cell D14, you would enter the following 
subtraction formula:
=C14-B14
Excel then returns the difference in cell D14 as a decimal value representing 
what fraction that difference represents of an entire day (that is, a 24-hour 
period). If, for example, cell B14 contains a starting time of 9:15 a.m. and cell 
C14 contains an ending time of 3:45 p.m., Excel returns the following decimal 
value to cell D14:
6:30 AM
To convert this time of day into its equivalent decimal number, you convert 
the time format automatically given to it to the General format (Ctrl+Shift+`), 
which displays the following result in cell D14:
0.270833
To convert this decimal number representing the fraction of an entire day 
into the number of hours that have elapsed, you simply multiply this result 
by 24 as in =D14*24, which gives you a result of 6.5 hours when you apply 
the General format (Ctrl+Shift+` or Ctrl+~) to it.
Using Date Functions
Excel contains a number of built-in date functions that you can use in your 
spreadsheets. When you install and activate the Analysis ToolPak add-in 
(see Book I, Chapter 3 for details), you have access to a number of additional 
Date functions — many of which are specially designed to deal with the 
normal Monday through Friday, five-day workweek (excluding, of course, 
your precious weekend days from the calculations).

Using Date Functions
TODAY
The easiest date function has to be TODAY. This function takes no argu-
ments and is always entered as follows:
=TODAY()
When you enter the TODAY function in a cell by clicking it on the Date & 
Time command button’s drop-down list on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab or by 
typing it, Excel returns the current date by using the following Date format:
7/23/2010
 
Keep in mind that the date inserted into a cell with the TODAY function is 
not static. Whenever you open a worksheet that contains this function, Excel 
recalculates the function and updates its contents to the current date. This 
means that you don’t usually use TODAY to input the current date when 
you’re doing it for historical purposes (an invoice, for example) and never 
want it to change.
 
If you do use TODAY and then want to make the current date static in the 
spreadsheet, you need to convert the function into its serial number. You 
can do this for individual cells: First, select the cell, press F2 to activate 
Edit mode, press F9 to replace =TODAY() with today’s serial number on the 
Formula bar, and click the Enter button to insert this serial number into the 
cell. You can do this conversion on a range of cells by selecting the range, 
copying it to the Clipboard by clicking the Copy button on the Home tab of 
the Ribbon (or pressing Ctrl+C), and then immediately pasting the calculated 
values into the same range by clicking the Paste Values option on the Paste 
command button’s drop-down menu (or pressing Alt+HVV).
DATE and DATEVALUE
The DATE function on the Date & Time command button’s drop-down menu 
returns a date serial number for the date specified by the year, month, and 
day argument. This function uses the following syntax:
DATE(year,month,day)
This function comes in handy when you have a worksheet that contains the 
different parts of the date in separate columns, similar to the one shown in 
Figure 3-1. You can use it to combine the three columns of date information 
into a single date cell that you can use in sorting and filtering (see Book VI, 
Chapters 1 and 2 to find out how to sort and filter data).

The DATEVALUE function on the Date & Time button’s drop-down menu 
on the Formulas tab returns the date serial number for a date that’s been 
entered into the spreadsheet as text so that you can use it in date calcula-
tions. This function takes a single argument:
DATEVALUE(date_text)
Suppose, for example, that you’ve made the following text entry in cell B12:
‘5/21/2004
(Remember that when you preface an entry with an apostrophe, Excel 
inserts that entry as text even if the program would otherwise put it in as 
a value.) You can then convert this text entry into a date serial number by 
entering the following formula in cell C12 next door:
=DATEVALUE(B12)
Excel then returns the date serial number, 38128 to cell C12, which you can 
convert into a more intelligible date by formatting it with one of Excel’s Date 
number formats (Ctrl+1).
 
You must convert the DATE and DATEVALUE functions into their calculated 
date serial numbers in order to sort and filter them. To convert these func-
tions individually, select a cell, press F2 to activate Edit mode, and then

press F9 to replace the function with the calculated date serial number; 
finally, click the Enter button on the Formula bar to insert this serial number 
into the cell. To do this conversion on a range of cells, select the range, copy 
it to the Clipboard by pressing Ctrl+C, and then immediately paste the calcu-
lated serial numbers into the same range by clicking the Paste Values option 
on the Paste command button’s drop-down menu (or press Alt+HVV).
DAY, WEEKDAY, MONTH, and YEAR
The DAY, WEEKDAY, MONTH, and YEAR date functions on the Date & Time 
command button’s drop-down menu all return just parts of the date serial 
number that you specify as their argument:
 
✦ DAY(serial_number) to return the day of the month in the date (as a 
number between 1 and 31).
 
✦ WEEKDAY(serial_number,[return_type]) to return the day of the week 
(as a number between 1 and 7 or 0 and 6). The optional return_type 
argument is a number between 1 and 3; 1 (or no return_type argument) 
specifies the first type where 1 equals Sunday and 7 equals Saturday; 2 
specifies the second type where 1 equals Monday and 7 equals Sunday; 
and 3 specifies the third type where 0 equals Monday and 6 equals 
Sunday.
 
✦ MONTH(serial_number) to return the number of the month in the date 
serial number (from 1 to 12).
 
✦ YEAR(serial_number) to return the number of the year (as an integer 
between 1900 and 9999) in the date serial number.
For example, if you enter the following DAY function in a cell as follows:
DAY(DATE(08,4,15))
Excel returns the value 15 to that cell. If, instead, you use the WEEKDAY 
function as follows:
WEEKDAY(DATE(08,4,15))
Excel returns the value 4, which represents Wednesday (using the first 
return_type where Sunday is 1 and Saturday is 7) because the optional 
return_type argument isn’t specified. If you use the MONTH function on this 
date as in the following:
MONTH(DATE(08,4,15))
Excel returns 4 to the cell. If, however, you use the YEAR function on this 
date as in the following:
YEAR(DATE(08,4,15))

362
Using Date Functions
Excel returns 1908 to the cell (instead of 2008).
 
This means that if you want to enter a year in the twenty-first century as the 
year argument of the DATE function, you need to enter all four digits of the 
date, as in the following:
DATE(2008,4,15)
Note that you can use the YEAR function to calculate the difference in years 
between two dates. For example, if cell B12 contains 7/23/1978 and cell C12 
contains 7/23/2008, you can enter the following formula using the YEAR func-
tion to determine the difference in years:
=YEAR(C12)-YEAR(B12)
Excel then returns 2/9/1900 to the cell containing this formula, which 
becomes 40 as soon as you apply the General number format to it (by press-
ing Ctrl+Shift+` or Ctrl+~).
 
Don’t use these functions on dates entered as text entries. Always use the 
DATEVALUE function to convert these text dates and then use the DAY, 
WEEKDAY, MONTH, or YEAR functions on the serial numbers returned by 
the DATEVALUE function to ensure accurate results.
DAYS360
The DAYS360 function on the Date & Time command button’s drop-down 
menu returns the number of days between two dates based on a 360-day 
year (that is, one in which there are 12 equal months of 30 days each). The 
DAYS360 function takes the following arguments:
DAYS360(start_date,end_date,[method])
The start_date and end_date arguments are date serial numbers or references 
to cells that contain such serial numbers. The optional method argument is 
either TRUE or FALSE, where FALSE specifies the use of the U.S. calculation 
method and TRUE specifies the use of the European calculation method:
 
✦ U.S. (NASD) method (FALSE or method argument omitted): In this 
method, if the starting date is equal to the 31st of the month, it becomes 
equal to the 30th of the same month; if the ending date is the 31st of a 
month and the starting date is earlier than the 30th of the month, the 
ending date becomes the 1st of the next month; otherwise, the ending 
date becomes equal to the 30th of the same month.
 
✦ European method (TRUE): In this method, starting and ending dates 
that occur on the 31st of a month become equal to the 30th of the same 
month.

Other special Date functions
Excel includes other special Date functions in the Date and Time category in 
the Insert Function dialog box. These particular Date functions expand your 
abilities to do date calculations in the worksheet — especially those that 
work only with normal, Monday through Friday, workdays.
EDATE
The EDATE (for Elapsed Date) function calculates a future or past date that 
is so many months ahead or behind the date that you specify as its start_date 
argument. You can use the EDATE function to quickly determine the par-
ticular date at a particular interval in the future or past (for example, three 
months ahead or one month ago).
The EDATE function takes two arguments:
EDATE(start_date,months)
The start_date argument is the date serial number that you want used as 
the base date. The months argument is a positive (for future dates) or nega-
tive (for past dates) integer that represents the number of months ahead or 
months past to calculate.
For example, suppose that you enter the following EDATE function in a cell:
=EDATE(DATE(2004,1, 31),1)
Excel returns the date serial number, 38046, which becomes 2/29/2004 when 
you apply the first Date format to its cell.
EOMONTH
The EOMONTH (for End of Month) function calculates the last day of the 
month that is so many months ahead or behind the date that you specify 
as its start_date argument. You can use the EOMONTH function to quickly 
determine the end of the month at a set interval in the future or past.
For example, suppose that you enter the following EOMONTH function in a 
cell:
=EOMONTH(DATE(2008,1,1),1)
Excel returns the date serial number, 39507, which becomes 2/29/2008 when 
you apply the first Date format to its cell.

364
Using Date Functions
NETWORKDAYS
The NETWORKDAYS function returns the number of workdays that exist 
between a starting date and ending date that you specify as arguments:
NETWORKDAYS(start_date,end_date,[holidays])
When using this function, you can also specify a cell range in the work-
sheet or array constant to use as an optional holidays argument that lists 
the state, federal, and floating holidays observed by your company. Excel 
then excludes any dates listed in the holidays argument when they occur in 
between start_date and end_date arguments.
Figure 3-2 illustrates how this function works. In this worksheet, I created a 
list in the cell range B3:B13 with all the observed holidays in the calendar 
year 2010. I then entered the following NETWORKDAYS function in cell E4:
NETWORKDAYS(DATE(2009,12,31),DATE(2010,12,31),B3:B13)
The preceding function calculates the number of workdays between 
December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2010 (262 total work days), and then 
subtracts the dates listed in the cell range B3:B13 if they fall on a weekday. 
As 10 of the 11 holidays in the range B3:B13 happen to fall on a weekday in 
the year 2010, the number of workdays between December 31, 2009, and 
December 31, 2010, is calculated as 252 in cell E4 (262–10=252).

Using Date Functions
WEEKNUM
The WEEKNUM function returns a number indicating where the week in 
a particular date falls within the year. This function takes the following 
arguments:
WEEKNUM(serial_number,[return_type])
In this function, the serial_number argument is the date whose week in the 
year you want to determine. The optional return_type argument is number 
1 or 2, where number 1 (or omitted) indicates that the new week begins on 
Sunday and weekdays are numbered from 1 to 7. Number 2 indicates that 
the new week begins on Monday and that weekdays are also numbered from 
1 to 7.
For example, if you enter the following WEEKNUM function in a cell:
=WEEKNUM(DATE(2003,1,19))
Excel returns the number 4, indicating that the week containing the date 
January 19, 2003, is the fourth week in the year when the Sunday is con-
sidered to be the first day of the week (January 19, 2003 fell on a Sunday). 
Note that if I had added 2 as the optional return-type argument, Excel would 
return 3 as the result because January 19, 2003 is deemed to fall on the last 
day of the third week of the year when Monday is considered the first day 
of the week.
WORKDAY
You can use the WORKDAY function to find out the date that is so many 
workdays before or after a particular date. This function takes the following 
arguments:
WORKDAY(start_date,days,[holidays])
The start_date argument is the initial date that you want used in calculating 
the date of the workday that falls so many days before or after it. The days 
argument is the number of workdays ahead (positive integer) or behind 
(negative integer) the start_date. The optional holidays argument is an array 
constant or cell range that contains the dates of the holidays that should be 
excluded (when they fall on a weekday) in calculating the new date.
For example, suppose that you want to determine a due date for a report 
that is 30 workdays after February 1, 2010, by using the same holiday sched-
ule entered in the cell range B3:B13 in the Work Days 2010 workbook, shown 
in Figure 3-2. To do this, you enter the following formula:
=WORKDAY(DATE(2010,2,1),30,B3:B11)

366
Using Time Functions
Excel then returns the serial number 40253 to the cell, which then appears 
as March 16, 2010 (the day before St. Patrick’s Day), when you format it with 
the first Date format.
YEARFRAC
The YEARFRAC (for Year Fraction) function enables you to calculate the 
fraction of the year, which is computed from the number of days between 
two dates. You can use the YEARFRAC function to determine the proportion 
of a whole year’s benefits or obligations to assign to a specific period.
The YEARFRAC function uses the following arguments:
YEARFRAC(start_date,end_date,[basis])
The optional basis argument in the YEARFRAC function is a number between 
0 and 4 that determines the day count basis to use in determining the frac-
tional part of the year:
 
✦ 0 (or omitted) to base it on the U.S. (NASD) method of 30/360 (see 
“DAYS360” earlier in the chapter for details on the U.S. method)
 
✦ 1 to base the fraction on actual days/actual days
 
✦ 2 to base the fraction on actual days/360
 
✦ 3 to base the fraction on actual days/365
 
✦ 4 to base the fraction on the European method of 30/360 (see “DAYS360” 
earlier in the chapter for details on the European method)
For example, if you enter the following YEARFRAC formula in a cell to find 
what percentage of the year remains as of October 15, 2010:
=YEARFRAC(DATE(2010,10,15),DATE(2010,12,31),2)
Excel returns the decimal value 0.241667 to the cell, indicating that just over 
24 percent of the year remains.
Using Time Functions
Excel offers much fewer time functions when compared to the wide array 
of date functions. Like the date functions, however, the time functions 
enable you to convert text entries representing times of day into time serial 
numbers so that you can use them in calculations. The time functions also 
include functions for combining different parts of a time into a single serial 
time number, as well as those for extracting the hours, minutes, and seconds 
from a single time serial number.

Using Time Functions
NOW
The NOW function on the Date & Time command button’s drop-down menu 
gives you the current time and date based on your computer’s internal 
clock. You can use the NOW function to date- and time-stamp the worksheet. 
Like the TODAY function, NOW takes no arguments and is automatically 
recalculated every time you open the spreadsheet:
=NOW()
When you enter the NOW function in a cell, Excel puts the date before the 
current time. It also formats the date with the first Date format and the time 
with the 24-hour Time format. So, if the current date was November 11, 2010, 
and the current time was 2:22 p.m. at the moment when Excel calculates the 
NOW function, your cell would contain the following entry:
11/7/2010 14:22
 
Note that the combination date/time format that the NOW function uses is 
a custom number format. If you want to assign a different date/time to the 
date and time serial numbers returned by this function, you have to create 
your own custom number format and then assign it to the cell that contains 
the NOW function (see Book II, Chapter 2 for information on creating custom 
number formats).
TIME and TIMEVALUE
The TIME function on the Date & Time command button’s drop-down menu 
enables you to create a decimal number representing a time serial number, 
ranging from 0 (zero) to 0.99999999, representing time 0:00:00 (12:00:00 AM) 
to 23:59:59 (11:59:59 PM). You can use the TIME function to combine the 
hours, minutes, and seconds of a time into a single time serial number when 
these parts are stored in separate cells.
The TIME function takes the following arguments:
TIME(hour,minute,second)
When specifying the hour argument, you use a number between 0 and 23 
(any number greater than 23 is divided by 24 and the remainder is used as 
the hour value). When specifying the minute and second arguments, you use 
a number between 0 and 59 (any minute argument greater than 59 is con-
verted into hours and minutes, just as any second argument greater than 59 
is converted into hours, minutes, and seconds).
For example, if cell A3 contains 4, cell B3 contains 37, and cell C3 contains 0, 
and you enter the following TIME function in cell D3:
=TIME(A3,B3,C3)

368
Using Time Functions
Excel enters 4:37 a.m. in cell D3. If you then assign the General number 
format to this cell (Ctrl+Shift+` or Ctrl+~), it would then contain the time 
serial number, 0.192361.
The TIMEVALUE function converts a time entered or imported into the 
spreadsheet as a text entry into its equivalent time serial number so that 
you can use it in time calculations. The TIMEVALUE function uses a single 
time_text argument as follows:
TIMEVALUE(time_text)
So, for example, if you put the following TIMEVALUE function in a cell to 
determine the time serial number for 10:35:25:
=TIMEVALUE(“10:35:25”)
Excel returns the time serial number 0.441262 to the cell. If you then assign 
the first Time number format to this cell, the decimal number appears as 
10:35:25 a.m. in the cell.
HOUR, MINUTE, and SECOND
The HOUR, MINUTE, and SECOND functions on the Date & Time command 
button’s drop-down menu enable you to extract specific parts of a time 
value in the spreadsheet. Each of these three time functions takes a single 
serial_number argument that contains the hour, minute, or second that you 
want to extract.
So, for example, if cell B5 contains the time 1:30:10 p.m. (otherwise known 
as serial number 0.5626157) and you enter the following HOUR function in 
cell C5:
=HOUR(B5)
Excel returns 13 as the hour to cell C5 (hours are always returned in 24-hour

oney! There’s nothing quite like it. You can’t live with it, and you cer-
tainly can’t live without it. Many of the spreadsheets that you work 
with exist only to let you know how much of it you can expect to come in or 
to pay out. Excel contains a fair number of sophisticated financial functions 
for determining such things as the present, future, or net present value of 
an investment; the payment, number of periods, or the principal or interest 
part of a payment on an amortized loan; the rate of return on an investment; 
or the depreciation of your favorite assets.
By activating the Analysis ToolPak add-in, you add over 30 specialized 
financial functions that run the gamut from those that calculate the accrued 
interest for a security paying interest periodically and only at maturity, all 
the way to those that calculate the internal rate of return and the net pres-
ent value for a schedule of nonperiodic cash flows.
Financial Functions 101
The key to using any of Excel’s financial functions is to understand the 
terminology used by their arguments. Many of the most common financial 
functions, such as PV (Present Value), NPV (Net Present Value), FV (Future 
Value), and PMT (Payment), take similar arguments:
 
✦ PV is the present value that is the principal amount of the annuity.
 
✦ FV is the future value that represents the principal plus interest on the 
annuity.
 
✦ PMT is the payment made each period in the annuity. Normally, the 
payment is set over the life of the annuity and includes principal plus 
interest without any other fees.
 
✦ RATE is the interest rate per period. Normally, the rate is expressed as 
an annual percentage.

370
Financial Functions 101
 
✦ NPER is the total number of payment periods in the life of the annuity. 
You calculate this number by taking the Term (the amount of time that 
interest is paid) and multiplying it by the Period (the point in time when 
interest is paid or earned) so that a loan with a three-year term with 12 
monthly interest payments has 3 x 12, or 36 payment periods.
 
When using financial functions, keep in mind that the fv, pv, and pmt argu-
ments can be positive or negative, depending on whether you’re receiving 
the money (as in the case of an investment) or paying out the money (as in 
the case of a loan). Also keep in mind that you want to express the rate argu-
ment in the same units as the nper argument, so that if you make monthly 
payments on a loan and you express the nper as the total number of monthly 
payments, as in 360 (30 x 12) for a 30-year mortgage, you need to express 
the annual interest rate in monthly terms as well. For example, if you pay 
an annual interest rate of 7.5 percent on the loan, you express the rate argu-
ment as 0.075/12 so that it is monthly as well.
The PV, NPV, and FV functions
The PV (Present Value), NPV (Net Present Value), and FV (Future Value) func-
tions all found on the Financial button’s drop-down menu on the Ribbon’s 
Formulas tab (Alt+MI) enable you to determine the profitability of an investment.
Calculating the Present Value
The PV, or Present Value, function returns the present value of an invest-
ment, which is the total amount that a series of future payments is worth 
presently. The syntax of the PV function is as follows:
=PV(rate,nper,pmt,[fv],[type])
The fv and type arguments are optional arguments in the function (indicated 
by the square brackets). The fv argument is the future value or cash balance 
that you want to have after making your last payment. If you omit the fv 
argument, Excel assumes a future value of zero (0). The type argument indi-
cates whether the payment is made at the beginning or end of the period: 
Enter 0 (or omit the type argument) when the payment is made at the end of 
the period and use 1 when it is made at the beginning of the period.
Figure 4-1 contains several examples using the PV function. All three PV 
functions use the same annual percentage rate of 7.25 percent and term of 10 
years. Because payments are made monthly, each function converts these 
annual figures into monthly ones. For example, in the PV function in cell E3, 
the annual interest rate in cell A3 is converted into a monthly rate by divid-
ing by 12 (A3/12). The annual term in cell B3 is converted into equivalent 
monthly periods by multiplying by 12 (B3 x 12).

Figure 4-1: 
Using the 
PV function 
to calculate 
the present 
value of 
various 
investments.
 
Note that although the PV functions in cells E3 and E5 use the rate, nper, and 
pmt ($218.46) arguments, their results are slightly different. This is caused 
by the difference in the type argument in the two functions: the PV function 
in cell E3 assumes that each payment is made at the end of the period (the 
type argument is 0 whenever it is omitted), while the PV function in cell E5 
assumes that each payment is made at the beginning of the period (indi-
cated by a type argument of 1). When the payment is made at the beginning 
of the period, the present value of this investment is $0.49 higher than when 
the payment is made at the end of the period, reflecting the interest accrued 
during the last period.
The third example in cell E7 (shown in Figure 4-1) uses the PV function with 
an fv argument instead of the pmt argument. In this example, the PV func-
tion states that you would have to make monthly payments of $3,883.06 for a 
10-year period to realize a cash balance of $8,000, assuming that the invest-
ment returned a constant annual interest rate of 7 1/4 percent. Note that 
when you use the PV function with the fv argument instead of the pmt argu-
ment, you must still indicate the position of the pmt argument in the function 
with a comma (thus the two commas in a row in the function) so that Excel 
doesn’t mistake your fv argument for the pmt argument.

372
Financial Functions 101
Calculating the Net Present Value
The NPV function calculates the net present value based on a series of cash 
flows. The syntax of this function is
=NPV(rate,value1,[value2],[...])
where value1, value2, and so on are between 1 and 13 value arguments 
representing a series of payments (negative values) and income (positive 
values), each of which is equally spaced in time and occurs at the end of 
the period. The NPV investment begins one period before the period of the 
value1 cash flow and ends with the last cash flow in the argument list. If your 
first cash flow occurs at the beginning of the period, you must add it to the 
result of the NPV function rather than include it as one of the arguments.
Figure 4-2 illustrates the use of the NPV function to evaluate the attractive-
ness of a five-year investment that requires an initial investment of $30,000 
(the value in cell G3). The first year, you expect a loss of $22,000 (cell B3); 
the second year, a profit of $15,000 (cell C3); the third year, a profit of 
$25,000 (cell D3); the fourth year, a profit of $32,000 (cell E3); and the fifth 
year, a profit of $38,000 (cell F3). Note that these cell references are used as 
the value arguments of the NPV function.
Unlike when using the PV function, the NPV function doesn’t require an even 
stream of cash flows. The rate argument in the function is set at 8 percent. In 
this example, this represents the discount rate of the investment: that is, the 
interest rate that you may expect to get during the five-year period if you put 
your money into some other type of investment, such as a high-yield money-
market account. This NPV function in cell A3 returns a net present value of 
$31,718.63, indicating that you can expect to realize about $1,719 more from 
investing your $30,000 in this investment than you would from investing the 
money in a money-market account at an interest rate of 8 percent.
Calculating the Future Value
The FV function calculates the future value of an investment. The syntax of 
this function is
=FV(rate,nper,pmt,[pv],[type])
The rate, nper, pmt, and type arguments are the same as those used by the 
PV function. The pv argument is the present value or lump-sum amount for 
which you want to calculate the future value. As with the fv and type argu-
ments in the PV function, both the pv and type arguments are optional in the 
FV function. If you omit these arguments, Excel assumes their values to be 
zero (0) in the function.

You can use the FV function to calculate the future value of an investment, 
such as an IRA (Individual Retirement Account). For example, suppose that 
you establish an IRA at age 43 and will retire 22 years from now at age 65 and 
that you plan to make annual payments into the IRA at the beginning of each 
year. If you assume a rate of return of 8.5 percent a year, you would enter 
the following FV function in your worksheet:
=FV(8.5%,22,–1000,,1)
Excel then indicates that you can expect a future value of $64,053.66 for your 
IRA when you retire at age 65. If you had established the IRA a year prior and 
the account already has a present value of $1,085, you would amend the FV 
function as follows:
=FV(8.5%,22,–1000,–1085,1)
In this case, Excel indicates that you can expect a future value of $70,583.22 
for your IRA at retirement.
The PMT function
The PMT function on the Financial button’s drop-down menu on the 
Formulas tab of the Ribbon calculates the periodic payment for an annuity, 

374
Financial Functions 101
assuming a stream of equal payments and a constant rate of interest. The 
PMT function uses the following syntax:
=PMT(rate,nper,pv,[fv],[type])
As with the other common financial functions, rate is the interest rate per 
period, nper is the number of periods, pv is the present value or the amount 
the future payments are worth presently, fv is the future value or cash bal-
ance that you want after the last payment is made (Excel assumes a future 
value of zero when you omit this optional argument as you would when 
calculating loan payments), and type is the value 0 for payments made at the 
end of the period or the value 1 for payments made at the beginning of the 
period. (If you omit the optional type argument, Excel assumes that the pay-
ment is made at the end of the period.)
The PMT function is often used to calculate the payment for mortgage loans 
that have a fixed rate of interest. Figure 4-3 shows you a sample worksheet 
that contains a table using the PMT function to calculate loan payments for 
a range of interest rates (from 4.5 percent to 5.74 percent) and principals 
($350,000 to $359,000). The table uses the initial principal that you enter 
in cell B2, copies it to cell A7, and then increases it by $1,000 in the range 
A8:A16. The table uses the initial interest rate that you enter in cell B3, 
copies to cell B6, and then increases this initial rate by 1/4 of a percent in 
the range C6:G6. The term in years in cell B4 is a constant factor that is used 
in the entire loan payment table.
To get an idea of how easy it is to build this type of loan payment table with 
the PMT function, follow these steps for creating it in a new worksheet:
 
1. Enter the titles Loan Payments in cell A1, Principal in cell A2, Interest 
Rate in cell A3, and Term (in years) in cell A4.
 
2. Enter $350,000 in cell B2, enter 4.5% in cell B3, and enter 30 in cell B4.
 
 These are the starting values with which you build the Loan Payments 
table.
 
3. Position the cell pointer in B6 and then build the formula =B3.
 
 By creating a linking formula that brings forward the starting interest 
rate value in B3 with the formula, you ensure that the interest rate value 
in B6 will immediately reflect any change that you make in cell B3.
 
4. Position the cell pointer in cell C6 and then build the formula 
=B6+.25%.
 
 By adding 1/4 of a percent to the interest rate to the value in B6 with the 
formula =B6+.25% in C6 rather than creating a series with the AutoFill 
handle, you ensure that the interest rate value in cell C6 will always be 
1/4 of a percent larger than any interest rate value entered in cell B6.

5. Drag the Fill handle in cell C6 to extend the selection to the right to 
cell G6 and then release the mouse button.
 
6. Position the cell pointer in cell A7 and then build the formula =B2.
 
 Again, by using the formula =B2 to bring the initial principal forward to 
cell A7, you ensure that cell A7 always has the same value as cell B2.
 
7. Position the cell pointer in A8 active and then build the formula 
=A7+1000.
 
 Here too, you use the formula =A7+1000 rather than create a series 
with the AutoFill feature so that the principal value in A8 will always be 
$1,000 greater than any value placed in cell A7.
 
8. Drag the Fill handle in cell A8 down until you extend the selection to 
cell A16 and then release the mouse button.
 
9. In cell B7, click the Insert Function button on the Formula bar, click 
Financial in the Or Select a Category drop-down list, and then double-
click the PMT function in the Select a Function list box.
 
 The Function Arguments dialog box opens, where you specify the rate, 
nper, and pv arguments. Be sure to move the Function Arguments dialog 
box to the right so that no part of it obscures the data in columns A and 
B of your worksheet before proceeding with the following steps for fill-
ing in the arguments.

10. Click cell B6 to insert B6 in the Rate text box and then press F4 twice 
to convert the relative reference B6 to the mixed reference B$6 
(column relative, row absolute) before you type /12.
 
 You convert the relative cell reference B6 to the mixed reference B$6 
so that Excel does not adjust the row number when you copy the PMT 
formula down each row of the table, but does adjust the column letter 
when you copy the formula across its columns. Because the initial inter-
est rate entered in B3 (and then brought forward to cell B6) is an annual 
interest rate, but you want to know the monthly loan payment, you need 
to convert the annual rate to a monthly rate by dividing the value in cell 
B6 by 12.
 
11. Click the Nper text box, click cell B4 to insert this cell reference in 
this text box, and then press F4 once to convert the relative reference 
B4 to the absolute reference $B$4 before you type *12.
 
 You need to convert the relative cell reference B4 to the absolute refer-
ence $B$4 so that Excel adjusts neither the row number nor the column 
letter when you copy the PMT formula down the rows and across the 
columns of the table. Because the term in B3 (which is then brought for-
ward to cell B6) is an annual period, but you want to know the monthly 
loan payment, you need to convert the yearly periods to monthly peri-
ods by multiplying the value in cell B4 by 12.
 
12. Click the Pv text box, click A7 to insert this cell reference in this text 
box, and then press F4 three times to convert the relative reference 
A7 to the mixed reference $A7 (column absolute, row relative).
 
 You need to convert the relative cell reference A7 to the mixed reference 
$A7 so that Excel won’t adjust the column letter when you copy the PMT 
formula across each column of the table, but will adjust the row number 
when you copy the formula down across its rows.
 
13. Click OK to insert the formula =PMT(B$6/12,$B$4*12,$A7) in cell B7.
 
 Now you’re ready to copy this original PMT formula down and then over 
to fill in the entire Loan Payments table.
 
14. Drag the Fill handle on cell B7 down until you extend the fill range to 
cell B16 and then release the mouse button.
 
 After you’ve copied the original PMT formula down to cell B16, you’re 
ready to copy it to the right to G16.
 
15. Drag the Fill handle to the right until you extend the fill range B7:B16 
to cell G16 and then release the mouse button.
After copying the original formula with the Fill handle, be sure to widen 
columns B through G sufficiently to display their results. (You can do this 
in one step by dragging through the headers of these columns and then 
double-clicking the right border of column G.)

After you’ve created a loan table like this, you can then change the beginning 
principal or interest rate, as well as the term to see what the payments would be 
under various other scenarios. You can also turn on the Manual Recalculation 
so that you can control when the Loan Payments table is recalculated.
For information on how to switch to manual recalculation and use this mode 
to control when formulas are recalculated, see Book III, Chapter 1. For infor-
mation on how to protect the worksheet so that users can input new values 
only into the three input cells (B2, B3, and B4) to change the starting loan 
amount, interest rate, and the term of the loan, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
Depreciation functions
Excel lets you choose from four different Depreciation functions, each of 
which uses a slightly different method for depreciating an asset over time. 
These built-in Depreciation functions found on the Financial button’s drop-
down menu on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon include the following:
 
✦ SLN(cost,salvage,life) to calculate straight-line depreciation
 
✦ SYD(cost,salvage,life,per) to calculate sum-of-years-digits depreciation
 
✦ DB(cost,salvage,life,period,[month]) to calculate declining balance 
depreciation
 
✦ DDB(cost,salvage,life,period,[factor]) to calculate double-declining bal-
ance depreciation
As you can see, with the exception of the optional month argument in the 
DB function and the optional factor argument in the DDB function, all the 
Depreciation functions require the cost, salvage, and life arguments, and all 
but the SLN function require a period argument as well:
 
✦ Cost is the initial cost of the asset that you’re depreciating.
 
✦ Salvage is the value of the asset at the end of the depreciation (also 
known as the salvage value of the asset).
 
✦ Life is the number of periods over which the asset is depreciating (also 
known as the useful life of the asset).
 
✦ Per or Period is the period over which the asset is being depreciated. The 
units that you use in the period argument must be the same as those used 
in the life argument of the Depreciation function so that if you express the 
life argument in years, you must also express the period argument in years.
Note that the DB function accepts an optional month argument. This argu-
ment is the number of months that the asset is in use in the first year. If you 
omit the month argument from your DB function, Excel assumes the number 
of months of service to be 12.

378
Financial Functions 101
When using the DDB function to calculate the double-declining balance 
method of depreciation, you can add an optional factor argument. This argu-
ment is the rate at which the balance declines in the depreciation schedule. 
If you omit this optional factor argument, Excel assumes the rate to be 2 
(thus, the name double-declining balance).
Figure 4-4 contains a Depreciation table that uses all four depreciation meth-
ods to calculate the depreciation of office furniture originally costing $50,000 
to be depreciated over a 10-year period, assuming a salvage value of $1,000 
at the end of this depreciation period.
The Formula bar shown in Figure 4-4 shows the SLN formula that I entered 
into cell B8:
=B7-SLN($C$3,$C$5,$C$4)
This formula subtracts the amount of straight-line depreciation to be taken 
in the first year of service from the original cost of $50,000. (This value is 
brought forward from cell C3 by the formula =C3.) After creating this origi-
nal formula in cell B8, I then used the Fill handle to copy it down to cell B17, 
which contains the final salvage value of the asset in the 10th year of service.
Cell C8 contains a similar formula for calculating the sum-of-years-digits 
depreciation for the office furniture. This cell contains the following formula:
=C7-SYD($C$3,$C$5,$C$4,$A8)

This formula subtracts the amount of sum-of-years-digits depreciation to be 
taken at the end of the first year from the original cost of $50,000 in cell C7 (also 
brought forward from cell C3 by the formula =C3). After creating this original 
formula in cell C8, I again used the Fill handle to copy it down to cell C17, which 
also contains the final salvage value of the asset in the 10th year of service.
I used the same basic procedure to create the formulas using the DB and 
DDB depreciation methods in the cell ranges D8:D17 and E8:E17, respec-
tively. Cell D8 contains the following DB formula:
=D7-DB($C$3,$C$5,$C$4,$A8)
Cell E8 contains the following DDB formula:
=E7-DDB($C$3,$C$5,$C$4,$A8)
Note that, like the SYD function, both of these depreciation functions require the 
use of a period argument, which is supplied by the list of years in the cell range 
A8:A17. Note also, that the value in cell C4, which supplies the life argument to 
the SYD, DB, and DDB functions, matches the year units used in this cell range.
Analysis ToolPak financial functions
By activating the Analysis ToolPak add-in (see Book I, Chapter 3), you add 
a whole bunch of powerful financial functions to the Financial button’s

You may note in Table 4-1 that many of the Analysis ToolPak financial func-
tions make use of an optional basis argument. This optional basis argument 
is a number between 0 and 4 that determines the day count basis to use in 
determining the fractional part of the year:
 
✦ 0 (or omitted) to base it on the U.S. (NASD) method of 30/360 (see the 
coverage on the DAYS360 function in Book III, Chapter 3 for details on 
the U.S. method)
 
✦ 1 to base the fraction on actual days/actual days
 
✦ 2 to base the fraction on actual days/360
 
✦ 3 to base the fraction on actual days/365
 
✦ 4 to base the fraction on the European method of 30/360 (see the 
DAYS360 coverage in Book III, Chapter 3 for details on the European 
method)
 
For detailed information on the other required arguments in the Analysis 
ToolPak financial functions shown in this table, select the function on the 
Financial button’s drop-down list and then click the Help on This Function

T
his chapter examines two larger categories of Excel functions: Math 
& Trig and Statistical functions. The Math & Trig functions are found 
on the Math & Trig command button’s drop-down menu on the Ribbon’s 
Formulas tab (the button with the q on the book cover). This category 
includes all the specialized trigonometric functions such as those that 
return the sine, cosine, or tangents of various angles and logarithmic func-
tions (for finding the base-10 and natural logarithms of a number), along 
with the more common math functions for summing numbers, rounding 
numbers up or down, raising a number to a certain power, and finding the 
square root of numbers.
The Statistical functions are found on a continuation menu accessed from 
the More Functions command button’s drop-down menu on the Formulas 
tab (the button with the two books). Statistical functions include the more 
common functions that return the average, highest, and lowest values in a 
cell range all the way to the very sophisticated and specialized functions 
that calculate such things as the chi-squared distribution, binomial distribu-
tion probability, frequency, standard deviation, variance, and — my per-
sonal favorite — the skewness of a distribution in a particular population.
Math & Trig Functions
The mathematical functions are technically known as the Math & Trig cat-
egory when you encounter them on the Math & Trig command button on 
the Ribbon’s Formulas tab or in the Insert Function dialog box (opened by 
clicking the Insert Function button on the Formula bar).

384
Math & Trig Functions
This category groups together all the specialized trigonometric functions 
with the more common arithmetic functions. Although the trigonometric 
functions are primarily of use to engineers and scientists, the mathematical 
functions provide you with the ability to manipulate any type of values. This 
category of functions includes SUM, the most commonly used of all func-
tions; functions such as INT, EVEN, ODD, ROUND, and TRUNC that round off 
the values in your worksheet; functions such as PRODUCT, SUMPRODUCT, 
and SUMSQ that you can use to calculate the products of various values 
in the worksheet; and the SQRT function that you can use to calculate the 
square root of a value.
Rounding off numbers
You use the ROUND function on the Math & Trig command button’s drop-
down menu to round up or down fractional values in the worksheet as you 
might when working with financial spreadsheets that only need to show 
monetary values to the nearest dollar. Unlike when applying a number 
format to a cell, which affects only the number’s display, the ROUND func-
tion actually changes the way Excel stores the number in the cell that con-
tains the function. ROUND uses the following syntax:
ROUND(number,num_digits)
In this function, the number argument is the value that you want to round 
off, and num_digits is the number of digits to which you want the number 
rounded. If you enter 0 (zero) as the num_digits argument, Excel rounds 
the number to the nearest integer. If you make the num_digits argument a 
positive value, Excel rounds the number to the specified number of decimal 
places. If you enter the num_digits argument as a negative number, Excel 
rounds the number to the left of the decimal point.
Instead of the ROUND function, you can use the ROUNDUP or ROUNDDOWN 
function. Both ROUNDUP and ROUNDDOWN take the same number and num_
digits arguments as the ROUND function. The difference is that the ROUNDUP 
function always rounds up the value specified by the number argument, 
whereas the ROUNDDOWN function always rounds the value down.
Figure 5-1 illustrates the use of the ROUND, ROUNDUP, and ROUNDDOWN 
functions in rounding off the value of the mathematical constant pi (π). In 
cell A3, I entered the value of this constant (with just nine places of nonre-
peating fraction displayed when the column is widened) into this cell, using 
Excel’s PI function in the following formula:
=PI()
I then used the ROUND, ROUNDUP, and ROUNDDOWN functions in the cell 
range B3 through B10 to round this number up and down to various decimal 
places.

of pi with 
the ROUND,

functions.
 
Cell B3, the first cell that uses one of the ROUND functions to round off the 
value of pi, rounds this value to 3 because I used 0 (zero) as the num_digits 
argument of its ROUND function (causing Excel to round the value to the 
nearest whole number).
In Figure 5-1, note the difference between using the ROUND and ROUNDUP 
functions both with 2 as their num_digits arguments in cells B5 and B7, 
respectively. In cell B5, Excel rounds the value of pi off to 3.14, whereas 
in cell B7, the program rounds its value up to 3.15. Note that using the 
ROUNDDOWN function with 2 as its num_digits argument yields the same 
result, 3.14, as does using the ROUND function with 2 as its second argument.
The whole number and nothing but the whole number
You can also use the INT (for Integer) and TRUNC (for Truncate) functions 
on the Math & Trig command button’s drop-down menu to round off values 
in your spreadsheets. You use these functions only when you don’t care 
about all or part of the fractional portion of the value. When you use the INT 
function, which requires only a single number argument, Excel rounds the 
value down to the nearest integer (whole number). For example, cell A3 con-
tains the value of pi, as shown in Figure 5-1, and you enter the following INT 
function formula in the worksheet:
=INT(A3)

386
Math & Trig Functions
Excel returns the value 3 to the cell, the same as when you use 0 (zero) as 
the num_digits argument of the ROUND function in cell B3.
The TRUNC function uses the same number and num_digits arguments as the 
ROUND, ROUNDUP, and ROUNDDOWN functions, except that in the TRUNC 
function, the num_digits argument is purely optional. This argument is 
required in the ROUND, ROUNDUP, and ROUNDDOWN functions.
The TRUNC function doesn’t round off the number in question; it simply 
truncates the number to the nearest integer by removing the fractional part 
of the number. However, if you specify a num_digits argument, Excel uses 
that value to determine the precision of the truncation. So, going back to the 
example illustrated in Figure 5-1, if you enter the following TRUNC function, 
omitting the optional num_digits argument as in:
=TRUNC($A$3)
Excel returns 3 to the cell just like the formula =ROUND($A$3,0) does in cell 
B3. However, if you modify this TRUNC function by using 2 as its num_digits 
argument, as in
=TRUNC($A$3,2)
Excel then returns 3.14 (by cutting rest of the fraction) just as the formula 
=ROUND($A$3,2) does in cell B5.
The only time you notice a difference between the INT and TRUNC functions 
is when you use them with negative numbers. For example, if you use the 
TRUNC function to truncate the value –5.4 in the following formula:
=TRUNC(–5.4)
Excel returns –5 to the cell. If, however, you use the INT function with the 
same negative value, as in
=INT(–5.4)
Excel returns –6 to the cell. This is because the INT function rounds num-
bers down to the nearest integer using the fractional part of the number.
Let’s call it even or odd
Excel’s EVEN and ODD functions on the Math & Trig command button’s 
drop-down menu also round off numbers. The EVEN function rounds the 
value specified as its number argument up to the nearest even integer. The 
ODD function, of course, does just the opposite: rounding the value up to the 
nearest odd integer. So, for example, if cell C18 in a worksheet contains the 
value 345.25 and you use the EVEN function in the following formula:
=EVEN(C18)

Book III
Chapter 5
Math and Statistical 
Formulas
387
Math & Trig Functions
Excel rounds the value up to the next whole even number and returns 346 to 
the cell. If, however, you use the ODD function on this cell, as in
=ODD(C18)
Excel rounds the value up to the next odd whole number and returns 347 to 
the cell instead.
Building in a ceiling
The CEILING function on the Math & Trig command button’s drop-down 
menu enables you to not only round up a number, but also set the multiple 
of significance to be used when doing the rounding. This function can be 
very useful when dealing with figures that need rounding to particular units.
For example, suppose that you’re working on a worksheet that lists the retail 
prices for the various products that you sell, all based upon a particular 
markup over wholesale, and that many of these calculations result in many 
prices with cents below 50. If you don’t want to have any prices in the list 
that aren’t rounded to the nearest 50 cents or whole dollar, you can use the 
CEILING function to round up all these calculated retail prices to the nearest 
half dollar.
The CEILING function uses the following syntax:
CEILING(number,significance)
The number argument specifies the number you want to round up and the 
significance argument specifies the multiple to which you want to round. For 
the half-dollar example, suppose that you have the calculated number $12.35 
in cell B3 and you enter the following formula in cell C3:
=CEILING(B3,0.5)
Excel then returns $12.50 to cell C3. Further, suppose that cell B4 contains 
the calculated value $13.67, and you copy this formula down to cell C4 so 
that it contains
=CEILING(B4,0.5)
Excel then returns $14.00 to that cell.
POWER and SQRT
Although you can use the caret (^) operator to build a formula that raises 
a number to any power, you also need to be aware that Excel includes a 
math function called POWER found on the Math & Trig command button’s 
drop-down menu that accomplishes the same thing. For example, to build a 
formula that raises 5.9 to the third power (that is, cubes the number), you 
can use the exponentiation operator, as in

388
Math & Trig Functions
=5.9^3
You can have Excel perform the same calculation with the POWER function 
by entering this formula:
=POWER(5.9,3)
In either case, Excel returns the same result, 205.379. The only difference 
between using the exponentiation operator and the POWER function occurs 
on that rare, rare occasion when you have to raise a number by a fractional 
power. In that case, you need to use the POWER function instead of the caret 
(^) operator to get the correct result. For example, suppose that you need to 
raise 20 by the fraction 3/4; to do this, you build the following formula with 
the POWER function:
=POWER(20,3/4)
To use the exponentiation operator to calculate the result of raising 20 by 
the fraction 3/4, you can convert the fraction into decimal form, as in
=20^0.75
The SQRT function on the Math & Trig command button’s drop-down menu 
enables you to calculate the square root of any number that you specify as 
its sole number argument. For example, if you use the SQRT function to build 
the following formula in a cell:
=SQRT(144)
Excel returns 12 to that cell.
 
The SQRT function can’t deal with negative numbers, so if you try to find 
the square root of a negative value, Excel returns a nice #NUM! error value 
to that cell. To avoid such a nuisance, you need to use the ABS (for abso-
lute) math function, which returns the absolute value of a number (that is, 
the number without a sign). For example, suppose that cell A15 contains 
($49.00), showing that it’s something you owe, and you want to return the 
square root of this number in cell A16. To avoid the dreaded #NUM! error, 
you nest the ABS function inside the SQRT function. The ABS function 
returns the absolute value of the number you specify as its sole argument 
(that is, the value without its sign). To nest this function inside the SQRT 
function, you create the following formula:
=SQRT(ABS(A15))
Excel then returns 7 instead of #NUM! to cell A16 because the ABS function 
removes the negative sign from the 49.00 before the SQRT function calcu-
lates its square root (remember that Excel always performs the calculations 
in the innermost pair of parentheses first).

Math & Trig Functions
The SUM of the parts
No function in the entire galaxy of Excel functions comes anywhere close to 
the popularity of the SUM function in the spreadsheets that you build. So 
popular is this function, in fact, that Excel has its own Sum command button 
located on the Home tab of the Ribbon (the one with the S on it) that you 
most often use to build your SUM formulas. You should, however, be aware 
of the workings of the basic SUM function that the AutoSum button enables 
you to use so easily.
For the record, the syntax of the SUM function is as follows:
SUM(number1,[number2],[...])
When using the SUM function, only the number1 argument is required; this is 
the range of numbers in a cell range or array constant that you want added 
together. Be aware that you can enter up to a total of 29 other optional 
number arguments in a single SUM formula, all of which are separated by a 
comma (,). For example, you can build a SUM formula that totals numbers in 
several different ranges, as in
=SUM(B3:B10,Sheet2!B3:B10,Sheet3!B3:B10)
In this example, Excel sums the values in the cell range B3:B10 on Sheet1, 
Sheet2, and Sheet3 of the workbook, giving you the grand total of all these 
values in whatever cell you build this SUM formula.
Conditional summing
The SUM function is perfect when you want to get the totals for all the 
numbers in a particular range or set of ranges. But what about those times 
when you only want the total of certain items within a cell range? For those 
situations, you can use the SUMIF function on the Math & Trig command but-
ton’s drop-down menu. The SUMIF function enables you to tell Excel to add 
together the numbers in a particular range only when those numbers meet 
the criteria that you specify. The syntax of the SUMIF function is as follows:
SUMIF(range,criteria,[sum_range])
In the SUMIF function, the range argument specifies the range of cells that 
you want Excel to evaluate when doing the summing; the criteria argument 
specifies the criteria to be used in evaluating whether to include certain 
values in the range in the summing; and finally, the optional sum_range argu-
ment is the range of all the cells to be summed together. If you omit the 
sum_range argument, Excel sums only the cells specified in the range argument 
(and, of course, only if they meet the criteria specified in the criteria argument).

Math & Trig Functions
Summing only certain cells with SUMIF
Figure 5-2 illustrates how you can use the SUMIF function to total sales by 
the items sold. This figure shows a Sales data list sorted by the store loca-
tion and then the item sold. In this Daily Sales data list, there are three loca-
tions: Mission Street, Anderson Rd., and Curtis Way, of which only sales 
made at the Anderson Rd. location are visible in this figure.
To total the sales of Lemon tarts at all three locations in this data list, I cre-
ated the following SUMIF formula in cell I3:
=SUMIF(item_sold,”=Lemon tarts”,daily_sales)
In this example, item_sold is the range name given to the cell range C3:C62, 
which contains the list of each item that has been sold in the first five days 
of January, 2010 (Lemon tarts, Blueberry muffins, Lots of chips cookies, or 
Strawberry pie), and daily_sales is the range name assigned to the cell range 
G3:G62, which contains the extended sales made at each store for each item.
The SUMIF formula in cell I3 then looks for each occurrence of “Lemon tarts” 
in the item_sold range (the criteria argument for the SUMIF function) in the 
Item column of the Cookie Sales list and then adds its extended sales price 
from the daily_sales range in the Daily Sales column to the total.

The formulas in cells I4, I5, and I6 contain SUMIF functions very similar to the 
one in cell I3, except that they substitute the name of the dessert goodie in ques-
tion in place of the =Lemon tarts criteria argument. The formula in cell I8, how-
ever, is slightly different: This formula sums the sales for all items except for 
Strawberry pies. It does this with the SUMIF function in the following formula:
=SUMIF(item_sold,”<>Strawberry pie”,daily_sales)
Because I prefaced the item Strawberry pie with the not (<>) operator 
(which can be placed before or after the open double quotation mark), Excel 
sums the daily sale for every item except for Strawberry pie.
Statistical Functions
Excel includes one of the most complete sets of statistical functions avail-
able outside a dedicated statistics software program. When you want to 
access these functions from the Ribbon’s Formulas tab instead of the Insert 
Function dialog box, you need to click the More Functions command button 
and then highlight the Statistical option at the very top of the drop-down 
menu (or press Alt+MQS). Doing this displays a continuation menu listing all 
the Statistical functions in alphabetical order.
The statistical functions run the gamut from the more mundane AVERAGE, 
MAX, and MIN functions to the more exotic and much more specialized 
CHITEST, POISSON, and PERCENTILE statistical functions.
In addition to the more specialized statistical functions, Excel offers an 
assortment of counting functions that enable you to count the number of 
cells that contain values, are nonblank (and thus contain entries of any 
kind), or count only the cells in a given range that meet the criteria that 
you specify.
AVERAGE, MAX, and MIN
The AVERAGE, MAX (for maximum), and MIN (for minimum) functions are 
the most commonly used of the statistical functions because they are of use 
to both the average number cruncher as well as the dedicated statistician. 
All three functions follow the same syntax as the good old SUM function. For 
example, the syntax of the AVERAGE function uses the following arguments 
just as the SUM, MAX, and MIN functions do:
AVERAGE(number1,[number2],[...])
Just as in the SUM function, the number arguments are between 1 and 30 
numeric arguments for which you want the average. Figure 5-3 illustrates 

392
Statistical Functions
how you can use the AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, and MEDIAN functions in a work-
sheet. This example uses these functions to compute a few statistics on 
the selling prices of homes in a particular neighborhood. These statistics 
include the average, highest, lowest, and median selling price for the homes 
sold in April and May of 2010. All the statistical functions in this worksheet 
use the same number argument; that is, the cell range C3:C7.
The AVERAGE function computes the arithmetic mean of the values in this 
range by summing them and then dividing them by the number of values in 
the range. This AVERAGE function is equivalent to the following formula:
=SUM(C3:C7)/COUNT(C3:C7)
Note that this formula uses the SUM function to total the values and another 
statistical function called COUNT to determine the number of values in the 
list. The MAX and MIN functions simply compute the highest and lowest 
values in the cell range used as the number argument. The MEDIAN function 
computes the value that is in the middle of the range of values; that is, the 
one where half the values are greater and half are less. This is the reason 
that the median sales price (in cell C15) differs from the average sales price 
(in cell C9) in this worksheet.

Counting cells
Sometimes you need to know how many cells in a particular cell range, 
column or row, or even worksheet in your spreadsheet have cell entries and 
how many are still blank. Other times, you need to know just how many of 
the occupied cells have text entries and how many have numeric entries. 
Excel includes a number of counting functions that you can use in building 
formulas that calculate the number of cells in a particular region or work-
sheet that are occupied and can tell you what general type of entry they 
contain.
Building counting formulas
Figure 5-4 illustrates the different types of counting formulas that you can 
build to return such basic statistics as the total number of cells in a particu-
lar range, the number of occupied cells in that range, as well as the number 
of numeric and text entries in the occupied range. In this example spread-
sheet, I gave the name sales_data to the cell range A1:C7 (shown selected in 
Figure 5-4).
I then used the sales_data range name in a number of formulas that count 
its different aspects. The most basic formula is the one that returns the total 
number of cells in the sales_data range. To build this formula in cell C9, I 
used the ROWS and COLUMNS information functions (see Book III, Chapter 
6, for more on these types of functions) to return the number of rows and 
columns in the range, and then I created the following formula that multi-
plies these two values together:
=ROWS(sales_data)*COLUMNS(sales_data)
This formula, of course, returns 21 to cell C9. In the next formula, I calcu-
lated the number of these 21 cells that contain data entries (of whatever 
type) using the COUNTA function. This function counts the number of cells 
that are not empty in the ranges that you specify. The COUNTA function 
uses the following syntax:
COUNTA(value1,[value2],[...])
The value arguments (all of which are optional except for value1) are up 
to 30 different values or cell ranges that you want counted. Note that the 
COUNTA function counts a cell as long it has some entry, even if the entry is 
empty text set off by a single apostrophe (’). In the example shown in Figure 
5-4, cell C11 contains the following COUNTA function:
=COUNTA(sales_data)

394
Statistical Functions
 
Figure 5-4: 
A home 
sales 
spreadsheet 
with various 
counting 
formulas.
 
This formula returns 19 to cell C11. The next formula in the sample spreadsheet 
calculates the number of numeric entries in the cell range called sales_data. To 
do this, you use the COUNT function. The COUNT function takes the same argu-
ments as COUNTA, the only difference being that COUNT counts a value or cell 
specified in its value arguments only if it contains a numeric entry.
Cell C13 contains the following formula for calculating the number of 
numeric entries in the Home Sales table range called sales_data:
=COUNT(sales_data)
Excel returns 10 to cell C11. Note that in calculating this result, Excel counts 
the five date entries (with the date of each sale) in the cell range B3:B7 as 
well as the five numeric data entries (with the selling prices of each home) in 
the cell range C3:C7.
The next formula in the sample spreadsheet shown in Figure 5-4 uses the 
COUNTBLANK function to calculate the number of blank cells in the sales_data 
range. The COUNTBLANK function works just like the COUNTA and COUNT 
functions except that it returns the number of nonoccupied cells in the range. 
For this example, I entered the following COUNTBLANK function in cell C15:
=COUNTBLANK(sales_data)

Book III
Chapter 5
Math and Statistical 
Formulas
395
Statistical Functions
Excel then returns 2 to cell C15 (which makes sense because you know that 
of the 21 total cells in this range, Excel already said that 19 of them have 
entries of some kind).
The last two counting formulas in the sample spreadsheet shown in Figure 
5-4 return the number of text and nontext entries in the sales_data cell 
range. To do this, instead of counting functions, they use the ISTEXT and 
ISNONTEXT information functions as part of the IF conditions used with the 
good old SUM function.
The first formula for returning the number of text entries in the sales_data 
range in cell C17 is
{=SUM(IF(ISTEXT(sales_data),1,0))}
The second formula for returning the number of nontext entries in the sales_
data range in cell C19 is just like the one in cell C17 except that it uses the 
ISNONTEXT function instead of ISTEXT, as follows:
{=SUM(IF(ISNONTEXT(sales_data),1,0))}
The ISTEXT function in the formula in cell C17 returns logical TRUE when 
a cell in the sales_data range contains a text entry and FALSE when it does 
not. The ISNONTEXT function in the formula in cell C19 returns logical TRUE 
when a cell is blank or contains a numeric entry (in other words, anything 
but text) and FALSE when it contains text.
In both these formulas, the ISTEXT and ISNONTEXT functions are used as 
the logical_test arguments of an IF function with 1 as the value_if_true argu-
ment and 0 as the value_if_false argument (so that the cells are counted only 
when the ISTEXT or ISNONTEXT functions return the logical TRUE values). 
These IF functions are then nested within SUM functions, and these SUM 
functions, in turn, are entered as array formulas.
 
Note that you must enter these formulas in the worksheet as array formulas 
(by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter) so that Excel performs its counting calcula-
tions on each and every cell in the sales_data cell range. If you just enter the 
SUM formula with the nested IF and ISTEXT and ISNONTEXT functions as 
regular formulas, they would return 0 as the count for both text and nontext 
entries in the sales_data cell range (see Book III, Chapter 1 for details on 
building array formulas).
Counting occupied cells in entire rows, columns, and worksheets
You can use the COUNTA function to count the number of occupied cells in 
an entire row or column of a worksheet or even an entire worksheet in your 

396
Statistical Functions
workbook. For example, to count all the occupied cells in row 17 of a work-
sheet, you enter the following COUNTA formula:
=COUNTA(17:17)
If you want to find the number of nonblank cells in column B of the work-
sheet, you enter the following COUNTA formula:
=COUNTA(B:B)
To find out the number of occupied cells in the entire second worksheet 
of your workbook (assuming that it’s still called Sheet2), you enter this 
COUNTA formula:
=COUNTA(Sheet2!1:1048576)
Note that you can also enter the argument for this COUNTA function by 
designating the entire range of column letters (rather than the range of row 
numbers) as in:
=COUNTA(Sheet2!A:XFD)
However, Excel automatically converts the argument that specifies the range 
of columns to rows, using absolute references ($1:$1048576) as soon as you 
enter the COUNTA function in its cell.
 
When entering COUNTA functions that return the number of occupied cells 
in an entire row, column, or worksheet, you must be sure that you do not 
enter the formula in a cell within that row, column, or worksheet. If you do, 
Excel displays a Circular Reference Alert dialog box when you try to enter 
the formula in the worksheet. This happens because you are asking Excel to 
use the cell with the formula that does the counting in the count itself (defi-
nitely the type of circular logic that the program doesn’t allow).
Conditional counting
Excel includes a COUNTIF function that you can use to count cells in a range 
only when they meet a certain condition. The COUNTIF function takes two 
arguments and uses the following syntax:
COUNTIF(range,criteria)
The range argument specifies the range of cells from which the conditional 
count is to be calculated. The criteria argument specifies the condition to 
use. You can express this argument as a number, expression, or text that 
indicates which cells to count. When specifying a number for the criteria

argument, you don’t have to enclose the number in quotes. For example, in a 
cell range named table_data, to count the number of entries that contain the 
number 5, you enter the following COUNTIF formula:
=COUNTIF(table_data,5)
However, when specifying an expression or text as the criteria argument, 
you must enclose the expression or text in closed quotes as in “=5”, “>20”, 
or “New York”. So, if you want to use COUNTIF to find out how many cells in 
the table_data range have values greater than 5, you enter this version of the 
COUNTIF function:
=COUNTIF(table_data,”>5”)
When you want to use the COUNTIF function to find out the number of cells 
whose contents are equal to the contents of a particular cell in the work-
sheet, you just add the cell reference as the function’s criteria argument. For 
example, if you want to count the number of cells in the table_data range 
that are equal to the contents of cell B3 in the worksheet, you enter this 
formula:
=COUNTIF(table_data,B3)
However, when you want to specify an expression other than equality that 
refers to the contents of a cell in the worksheet, you must enclose the opera-
tor in a pair of double quotation marks and then add the ampersand (&) 
concatenation operator before the cell reference. For example, if you want to 
count how many cells in the table_data range have a value greater than the 
contents of cell B3, you enter this form of the COUNTIF function:
=COUNTIF(table_data,”>”&B3)
Note that when specifying text as the condition, you can use the two wild-
card characters: the asterisk (*) to represent an unspecified amount of 
characters and the question mark (?) to represent single characters in the 
COUNTIF function’s criteria argument. For example, to count all the cells in 
the table_data range whose text entries end with the word Street, you use 
the asterisk in the COUNTIF criteria argument as follows:
=COUNTIF(table_data,”*Street”)
To count the cells in the table_data range whose text entries contain the 
word discount anywhere in the entry, you sandwich discount between two 
asterisks in the COUNTIF criteria argument as follows:
=COUNTIF(table_data,”*discount*”)

Statistical Functions
To count the cells in the table_data range whose cell entries consist of any 
two characters followed by the letter y (as in day, say, pay, and so on), you 
use two question marks to stand in for the nonspecific characters followed 
by a y in the COUNTIF criteria argument, as in
=COUNTIF(table_data,”??y”)
When using the COUNTIF function to find the number of cells, you can 
include other statistical functions as the criteria argument. For example, 
suppose that you want to know the number of cells in the table_data range 
whose values are less than the average value in the range. To do this, you 
insert the AVERAGE function in the COUNTIF criteria argument as follows:
=COUNTIF(table_data,”<”&AVERAGE(table_data))
Using specialized statistical functions
You can use the built-in statistical functions found on the Statistical continu-
ation menu or located in the Statistical category in the Insert Function dialog 
box, both of which I discuss earlier in this chapter. Excel also offers a com-
plete set of special analysis tools as part of the Analysis ToolPak add-in.
The tools included in the Analysis ToolPak enable you to analyze worksheet 
data by using such things as ANOVA, F-Test, rank and percentile, t-Test, and 
Fourier analysis. Before you can use the statistical functions added by the 
Analysis ToolPak, you must install and load it as follows:
 
1. Open the Add-Ins tab of the Excel Options dialog box by clicking 
File➪Options➪Add-Ins or pressing Alt+FIAA.
 
 The Add-Ins tab of the Excel Options dialog box opens; it contains a list 
of all the add-in programs installed on your computer.
 
2. Click the Go button at the bottom of the Add-Ins tab of the Excel 
Options dialog box after you make sure that the Manage drop-down 
list box contains Excel Add-Ins.
 
 Excel opens the Add-Ins dialog box.
 
3. Click the Analysis ToolPak check box in the Add-Ins dialog box to put 
a check mark in it and then click the OK button.
 
4. If an alert dialog box asking you if you want to install the add-in 
appears, click its Yes button.
After you load the Analysis ToolPak in this manner, you then access the 
statistical analysis tools by clicking the Data Analysis command button in

T
his chapter covers three categories of Excel functions: the lookup and 
reference functions that return values and cell addresses from the 
spreadsheet, the information functions that return particular types of infor-
mation about cells in the spreadsheet, and the text functions that enable 
you to manipulate strings of text in the spreadsheet.
In these three different categories of Excel functions, perhaps none are as 
handy as the lookup functions that enable you to have Excel look up cer-
tain data in a table and then return other related data from that same table 
based on the results of that lookup.
Lookup and Reference
The lookup functions are located on the Lookup & Reference command but-
ton’s drop-down list (Alt+MO) on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab. Excel makes it 
easy to perform table lookups that either return information about entries 
in the table or actually return related data to other data lists in the spread-
sheet. By using Lookup tables to input information into a data list, you not 
only reduce the amount of data input that you have to do, but also eliminate 
the possibility of data entry errors. Using Lookup tables also makes it a snap 
to update your data lists: All you have to do is make the edits to the entries 
in the original Lookup table or schedule to have all their data entries in the 
list updated as well.
The reference functions in Excel enable you to return specific information 
about particular cells or parts of the worksheet; create hyperlinks to differ-
ent documents on your computer, network, or the Internet; and transpose 
ranges of vertical cells so that they run horizontally and vice versa.

402
Lookup and Reference
Looking up a single value with 
VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP
The most popular of the lookup functions are HLOOKUP (for Horizontal 
Lookup) and VLOOKUP (for Vertical Lookup) functions. These functions are 
located on the Lookup & Reference drop-down list on Formulas tab of the 
Ribbon as well as in the Lookup & Reference category in the Insert Function 
dialog box. They are part of a powerful group of functions that can return 
values by looking them up in data tables.
The VLOOKUP function searches vertically (top to bottom) the leftmost 
column of a Lookup table until the program locates a value that matches or 
exceeds the one you are looking up. The HLOOKUP function searches hori-
zontally (left to right) the topmost row of a Lookup table until it locates a 
value that matches or exceeds the one that you’re looking up.
The VLOOKUP function uses the following syntax:
VLOOKUP(lookup_value,table_array,col_index_num,[range_lookup])
The HLOOKUP function follows the nearly identical syntax:
HLOOKUP(lookup_value,table_array,row_index_num,[range_lookup])
In both functions, the lookup_value argument is the value that you want to 
look up in the Lookup table, and table_array is the cell range or name of the 
Lookup table that contains both the value to look up and the related value to 
return.
The col_index_num argument in the VLOOKUP function is the number of 
the column whose values are compared to the lookup_value argument in a 
vertical table. The row_index_num argument in the HLOOKUP function is the 
number of the row whose values are compared to the lookup_value in a hori-
zontal table.
When entering the col_index_num or row_index_num arguments in the 
VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP functions, you must enter a value greater than zero 
that does not exceed the total number of columns or rows in the Lookup 
table.
The optional range_lookup argument in both the VLOOKUP and the 
HLOOKUP functions is the logical TRUE or FALSE that specifies whether you 
want Excel to find an exact or approximate match for the lookup_value in 
the table_array. When you specify TRUE or omit the range_lookup argument 
in the VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP function, Excel finds an approximate match. 

Book III
Chapter 6
Lookup, Information, 
and Text Formulas
403
Lookup and Reference
When you specify FALSE as the range_lookup argument, Excel finds only 
exact matches.
Finding approximate matches pertains only when you’re looking up numeric 
entries (rather than text) in the first column or row of the vertical or hori-
zontal Lookup table. When Excel doesn’t find an exact match in this Lookup 
column or row, it locates the next highest value that doesn’t exceed the 
lookup_value argument and then returns the value in the column or row des-
ignated by the col_index_num or row_index_num arguments.
When using the VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP functions, the text or numeric 
entries in the Lookup column or row (that is, the leftmost column of a ver-
tical Lookup table or the top row of a horizontal Lookup table) must be 
unique. These entries must also be arranged or sorted in ascending order; 
that is, alphabetical order for text entries, and lowest-to-highest order for 
numeric entries (see Book VI, Chapter 1 for detailed information on sorting 
data in a spreadsheet).
Figure 6-1 shows an example of using the VLOOKUP function to return either 
a 15% or 20% tip from a tip table, depending on the pretax total of the check. 
Cell F3 contains the VLOOKUP function:
=VLOOKUP(Pretax_Total,Tip_Table,IF(Tip_Percentage=0.15,2,3)) 
This formula returns the amount of the tip based on the tip percentage in 
cell F1 and the pretax amount of the check in cell F2.
To use this tip table, enter the percentage of the tip (15% or 20%) in cell F1 
(named Tip_Percentage) and the amount of the check before tax in cell F2 
(named Pretax_Total). Excel then looks up the value that you enter in the 
Pretax_Total cell in the first column of the Lookup table, which includes the 
cell range A2:C101 and is named Tip_Table.
Excel then moves down the values in the first column of Tip_Table until it 
finds a match, whereupon the program uses the col_index_num argument in 
the VLOOKUP function to determine which tip amount from that row of the 
table to return to cell F3. If Excel finds that the value entered in the Pretax_
Total cell ($16.50 in this example) doesn’t exactly match one of the values 
in the first column of Tip_Table, the program continues to search down the 
comparison range until it encounters the first value that exceeds the pretax 
total (17.00 in cell A19 in this example). Excel then moves back up to the 
previous row in the table and returns the value in the column that matches 
the col_index_num argument of the VLOOKUP function (this is because the 
optional range_lookup argument has been omitted from the function).

Note that the tip table example in Figure 6-1 uses an IF function to deter-
mine the col_index_num argument for the VLOOKUP function in cell F3. 
The IF function determines the column number to be used in the tip table 
by matching the percentage entered in Tip_Percentage (cell F1) with 0.15. 
If they match, the function returns 2 as the col_index_num argument and 
the VLOOKUP function returns a value from the second column (the 15% 
column B) in the Tip_Table range. Otherwise, the IF function returns 3 as the 
col_index_num argument and the VLOOKUP function returns a value from 
the third column (the 20% column C) in the Tip_Table range.
Figure 6-2 shows an example that uses the HLOOKUP function to look up the 
price of each bakery item stored in a separate price Lookup table and then 
to return that price to the Price/Doz column of the Daily Sales list. Cell F3 
contains the original formula with the HLOOKUP function that is then copied 
down column F:
=HLOOKUP(item,Price_table,2,FALSE)
In this HLOOKUP function, the range name Item that’s given to the Item 
column in the range C3:C62 is defined as the lookup_value argument and the 
cell range name Price table that’s given to the cell range I1:M2 is the table_
array argument. The row_index_num argument is 2 because you want Excel 
to return the prices in the second row of the Prices Lookup table, and the 
optional range_lookup argument is FALSE because the item name in the Daily 
Sales list must match exactly the item name in the Prices Lookup table.

By having the HLOOKUP function use the Price table range to input the price 
per dozen for each bakery goods item in the Daily Sales list, you make it a 
very simple matter to update any of the sales in the list. All you have to do is 
change its Price/Doz cost in this range, and the HLOOKUP function immedi-
ately updates the new price in the Daily Sales list wherever the item is sold.
Performing a two-way lookup
In both the VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP examples, Excel only compares a single 
value in the data list to a single value in the vertical or horizontal Lookup 
table. Sometimes, however, you may have a table in which you need to per-
form a two-way lookup, whereby a piece of data is retrieved from the Lookup 
table based on looking up a value in the top row (with the table’s column 
headings) and a value in the first column (with the table’s row headings).
Figure 6-3 illustrates a situation in which you would use two values, the 
production date and the part number, to look up the expected production. 
In the 2010 Production Schedule table, the production dates for each part 
form the column headings in the first row of the table, and the part num-
bers form the row headings in its first column of the table.
To look up the number of parts to be produced for a particular month, you need 
to the use the MATCH function, which returns the relative position of a particu-
lar value in a cell range or array. The syntax of the MATCH function is as follows:
MATCH(lookup_value,lookup_array,[match_type])

406
Lookup and Reference
The lookup_value argument is, of course, the value whose position you want 
returned when a match is found, and the lookup_array is the cell range or 
array containing the values that you want to match. The optional match_type 
argument is the number 1, 0, or –1, which specifies how Excel matches the 
value specified by the lookup_value argument in the range specified by the 
lookup_array argument:
 
✦ Use match_type 1 to find the largest value that is less than or equal to 
the lookup_value. Note that the values in the lookup_array must be 
placed in ascending order when you use the 1 match_type argument 
(Excel uses this type of matching when the match_type argument is omit-
ted from the MATCH function).
 
✦ Use match_type 0 to find the first value that is exactly equal to the 
lookup_value. Note that the values in the lookup_array can be in any 
order when you use the 0 match_type argument.
 
✦ Use match_type –1 to find the smallest value that is greater than or equal 
to the lookup_value. Note that the values in the lookup_array must be 
placed in descending order when you use the –1 match_type argument.
In addition to looking up the position of the production date and part 
number in the column and row headings in the Production Schedule table, 
you need to use an INDEX function, which uses the relative row and column 
number position to return the number to be produced from the table itself. 
The INDEX function follows two different syntax forms: array and reference. 
You use the array form when you want a value returned from the table (as 
you do in this example), and you use the reference form when you want a 
reference returned from the table.
The syntax of the array form of the INDEX function is as follows:
INDEX(array,[row_num],[col_num])
The syntax of the reference form of the INDEX function is as follows:
INDEX(reference,[row_num],[col_num],[area_num])
The array argument of the array form of the INDEX function is a range of 
cells or array constant that you want Excel to use in the lookup. If this range 
or constant contains only one row or column, the corresponding row_num 
or col_num arguments are optional. If the range or array constant has more 
than one row or more than one column, and you specify both the row_num 
and the col_num arguments, Excel returns the value in the array argument 
that is located at the intersection of the row_num argument and the col_num 
argument.

Figure 6-3: 
Doing a 
two-way 
lookup 
in the 
Production 
Schedule 
table.
 
For the MATCH and INDEX functions in the example shown in Figure 6-3, I 
assigned the following range names to the following cell ranges:
 
✦ Table_data to the cell range A2:J6 with the production data plus column 
and row headings
 
✦ Part_list to the cell range A2:A6 with the row headings in the first 
column of the table
 
✦ Date_list to the cell range A2:J2 with the column headings in the first 
row of the table
 
✦ Part_lookup to cell B10 that contains the name of the part to look up in 
the table
 
✦ Date_lookup to cell B11 that contains the name of the production date to 
look up in the table
As Figure 6-3 shows, cell B12 contains a rather long and — at first glance — 
complex formula using the range names outlined previously and combining 
the INDEX and MATCH functions:
=INDEX(table_data,MATCH(part_lookup,part_list),MATCH(date_
lookup,date_list))

408
Lookup and Reference
So you can better understand how this formula works, I break the formula 
down into its three major components: the first MATCH function that 
returns the row_num argument for the INDEX function, the second MATCH 
function that returns the col_num argument for the INDEX function, and the 
INDEX function itself that uses the values returned by the two MATCH func-
tions to return the number of parts produced.
The first MATCH function that returns the row_num argument for the INDEX 
function is:
MATCH(part_lookup,part_list)
This MATCH function uses the value input into cell B10 (named part_lookup) 
and looks up its position in the cell range A2:A6 (named part_list). It then 
returns this row number to the INDEX function as its row_num argument. In 
the case of the example shown in Figure 6-3 where part AB-102 is entered in 
the part_lookup cell in B10, Excel returns 4 as the row_num argument to the 
INDEX function.
The second MATCH function that returns the col_num argument for the 
INDEX function is:
MATCH(date_lookup,date_list)
This second MATCH function uses the value input into cell B11 (named 
date_lookup) and looks up its position in the cell range A2:J2 (named 
date_list). It then returns this column number to the INDEX function as its 
col_num argument. In the case of the example shown in Figure 6-3 where 
June 1, 2010 (formatted as Jun-10), is entered in the date_lookup cell in B11, 
Excel returns 4 as the col_num argument to the INDEX function.
This means that for all its supposed complexity, the INDEX function shown on 
the Formula bar in Figure 6-3 contains the equivalent of the following formula:
=INDEX(table_data,4,4)
As Figure 6-3 shows, Excel returns 306 as the planned production value 
for part AB-102 in June, 2010. You can verify that this is correct by manu-
ally counting the rows and the columns in the table_data range (cell range 
A2:J6). If you count down four rows (including row 2, the first row of this 
range), you come to Part 102 in column A. If you then count four columns 
over (including column A with Part-102), you come to cell D5 in the Jun-10 
column with the value 306.
Reference functions
The reference functions on the Lookup & Reference command button’s drop-
down list on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon are designed to deal specifically 

Book III
Chapter 6
Lookup, Information, 
and Text Formulas
409
Lookup and Reference
with different aspects of cell references in the worksheet. This group of func-
tions includes:
 
✦ ADDRESS to return a cell reference as a text entry in a cell of the 
worksheet
 
✦ AREAS to return the number of areas in a list of values (areas are defined 
as a range of contiguous cells or a single cell in the cell reference)
 
✦ COLUMN to return the number representing the column position of a 
cell reference
 
✦ COLUMNS to return the number of columns in a reference
 
✦ HYPERLINK to create a link that opens another document stored on 
your computer, network, or the Internet (you can also do this with the 
Insert➪Hyperlink command — see Book IV, Chapter 2 for details)
 
✦ INDIRECT to return a cell reference specified by a text string and bring 
the contents in the cell to which it refers to that cell
 
✦ ROW to return the row number of a cell reference
 
✦ ROWS to return the number of rows in a cell range or array
 
✦ TRANSPOSE to return a vertical array as a horizontal array and vice versa
Get the skinny on columns and rows
The COLUMNS and ROWS functions return the number of columns and rows 
in a particular cell range or array. For example, if you have a cell range in 
the spreadsheet named product_mix, you can find out how many columns it 
contains by entering this formula:
=COLUMNS(product_mix)
If you want to know how many rows this range uses, you then enter this 
formula:
=ROWS(product_mix)
As indicated in the previous chapter, you can use the COLUMNS and ROWS 
functions together to calculate the total number of cells in a particular 
range. For example, if you want to know the exact number of cells used in 
the product_mix cell range, you create the following simple multiplication 
formula by using the COLUMNS and ROWS functions:
=COLUMNS(product_mix)*ROWS(product_mix)
 
Don’t confuse the COLUMNS (plural) function with the COLUMN (singular) 
function and the ROWS (plural) function with the ROW (singular) function. 
The COLUMN function returns the number of the column (as though Excel 

410
Lookup and Reference
were using the R1C1 reference system) for the cell reference that you specify 
as its sole argument. Likewise, the ROW function returns the number of the 
row for the cell reference that you specify as its argument.
Transposing cell ranges
The TRANSPOSE function enables you to change the orientation of a cell range 
(or array — see the section on entering array formulas in Book III, Chapter 1 
for details). You can use this function to transpose a vertical cell range where 
the data runs down the rows of adjacent columns to one where the data runs 
across the columns of adjacent rows and vice versa. To successfully use the 
TRANSPOSE function, not only must you select a range that has an opposite 
number of columns and rows, but you must also enter it as an array formula.
For example, if you’re using the TRANSPOSE function to transpose a 2 x 5 
cell range (that is, a range that takes up two adjacent rows and five adjacent 
columns), you must select a blank 5 x 2 cell range (that is, a range that takes 
five adjacent rows and two adjacent columns) in the worksheet before you 
use the Insert Function button to insert the TRANSPOSE function in the first 
cell. Then, after selecting the 2 x 5 cell range that contains the data that you 
want to transpose in the Array text box of the Function Arguments dialog 
box, you need to press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to close this dialog box and enter the 
TRANSPOSE function into the entire selected cell range as an array formula 
(enclosed in curly braces).
Suppose that you want to transpose the data entered into the cell range 
A10:C11 (a 2 x 3 array) to the blank cell range E10:F12 (a 3 x 2 array) of the 
worksheet. When you press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to complete the array formula, 
after selecting the cell range A10:C11 as the array argument, Excel puts the 
following array formula in every cell of the range:
{=TRANSPOSE(A10:C11)}
Figure 6-4 illustrates the use of the TRANSPOSE function. The cell range 
B2:C4 contains the original 3 x 2 array that I showed earlier in Figure 1-8 in 
Book III, Chapter 1 when discussing how you add array formulas to your 
worksheet. To convert this 3 x 2 array in the cell range B2:C4 to a 2 x 3 array 
in the range B6:D7, I followed these steps:
 
1. Select the blank cell range B6:D7 in the worksheet.
 
2. Click the Lookup & Reference command button on the Ribbon’s 
Formulas tab and then click the TRANSPOSE option on the button’s 
drop-down menu.
 
 Excel inserts =TRANSPOSE() on the Formula bar and opens the Function 
Arguments dialog box where the Array argument text box is selected.

Book III
Chapter 6
Lookup, Information, 
and Text Formulas
411
Lookup and Reference
 
3. Drag through the cell range B2:C4 in the worksheet so that the Array 
argument text box contains B2:C4 and the formula on the Formula bar 
now reads =TRANSPOSE(B2:C4).
 
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to close the Insert Arguments dialog box (don’t 
click OK) and to insert the TRANSPOSE array formula into the cell 
range B6:D7 as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
Clicking the OK button in the Function Arguments dialog box inserts the 
TRANSPOSE function into the active cell of the current cell selection. Doing 
this returns the #VALUE! error value to the cell. You must remember to 
press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to both close the dialog box and put the formula into 
the entire cell range.
 
If all you want to do is transpose row and column headings or a simple table 
of data, you don’t have to go through the rigmarole of creating an array for-
mula using the TRANSPOSE function. Simply copy the range of cells to be 
transposed with the Copy command button on the Home tab of the Ribbon. 
Position the cell cursor in the first empty cell where the transposed range is 
to be pasted before you click the Transpose option on the Paste command 
button’s drop-down menu.

Information, Please . . .
Information, Please . . .
The information functions on the continuation menu accessed by clicking 
the More Functions command button on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon and 
then highlighting the Information option (or by pressing Alt+MQI) consist 
of a number of functions designed to test the contents of a cell or cell range 
and give you information on its current contents.
These kinds of information functions are often combined with IF functions, 
which determine what type of calculation, if any, to perform. The informa-
tion function then becomes the logical_test argument of the IF function, and 
the outcome of the test, expressed as the logical TRUE or logical FALSE 
value, decides whether its value_if_true or its value_if_false argument is exe-
cuted (see Book III, Chapter 2 for information on using information functions 
that test for error values to trap errors in a spreadsheet).
In addition to the many information functions that test whether the contents 
of a cell are of a certain type, Excel offers a smaller set of functions that return 
coded information about a cell’s contents or formatting and about the current 
operating environment in which the workbook is functioning. The program 
also offers an N (for Number) function that returns the value in a cell and an 
NA (for Not Available) function that inserts the #N/A error value in the cell.
Getting specific information about a cell
The CELL function is the basic information function for getting all sorts of 
data about the current contents and formatting of a cell. The syntax of the 
CELL function is:
CELL(info_type,[reference])
The info_type argument is a text value that specifies the type of cell informa-
tion you want returned. The optional reference argument is the reference of 
the cell range for which you want information. When you omit this argument, 
Excel specifies the type of information specified by the info_type argument for 
the last cell that was changed in the worksheet. When you specify a cell range 
as the reference argument, Excel returns the type of information specified by 
the info_type argument for the first cell in the range (that is, the one in the 
upper-left corner, which may or may not be the active cell of the range).
Table 6-1 shows the various info_type arguments that you can specify when 
using the CELL function. Remember that you must enclose each info_type 
argument in the CELL function in double-quotes (to enter them as text values) 
to prevent Excel from returning the #NAME? error value to the cell containing

the CELL function formula. So, for example, if you want to return the contents 
of the first cell in the range B10:E80, you enter the following formula:
=CELL(“contents”,B10:E80)

Returns
“address”
Cell address of the first cell in the reference as text using abso-
lute cell references

Table 6-2 shows the different text values along with their number formats 
(codes) that can be returned when you specify “format” as the info_type 
argument in a CELL function (refer to Book II, Chapter 3 for details on 
number formats and the meaning of the various number format codes).

For example, if you use the CELL function that specifies “format” as the 
info_type argument on cell range A10:C28 (which you’ve formatted with the 
Comma style button on the Formula bar), as in the following formula:
=CELL(“format”,A10:C28)

Information, Please . . .
Excel returns the text value “,2-” (without the quotation marks) in the cell 
where you enter this formula signifying that the first cell uses the Comma 
style format with two decimal places and that negative values are displayed 
in color (red) and enclosed in parentheses.
Are you my type?
Excel provides another information function that returns the type of value 
in a cell. Aptly named, the TYPE function enables you to build formulas with 
the IF function that execute one type of behavior when the cell being tested 
contains a value and another when it contains text. The syntax of the TYPE 
function is:
TYPE(value)
The value argument of the TYPE function can be any Excel entry: text, 
number, logical value, or even an Error value or a cell reference that con-
tains such a value. The TYPE function returns the following values, indicat-
ing the type of contents:
 
✦ 1 for numbers
 
✦ 2 for text
 
✦ 3 for logical value (TRUE or FALSE)
 
✦ 4 for an array range or constant (see Book III, Chapter 1)
The following formula combines the CELL and TYPE functions nested within 
an IF function. This formula returns the type of the number formatting used 
in cell D11 only when the cell contains a value. Otherwise, it assumes that 
D11 contains a text entry, and it evaluates the type of alignment assigned to 
the text in that cell:
=IF(TYPE(D11)=1,CELL(“format”,D11),CELL(“prefix”,D11))
Using the IS functions
The IS information functions (as in ISBLANK, ISERR, and so on) are a large 
group of functions that perform essentially the same task. They evaluate 
a value or cell reference and return the logical TRUE or FALSE, depending 
on whether the value is or isn’t the type for which the IS function tests. For 
example, if you use the ISBLANK function to test the contents of cell A1 as in:
=ISBLANK(A1)
Excel returns TRUE to the cell containing the formula when A1 is empty and 
FALSE when it’s occupied by any type of entry.

416
Much Ado about Text
Excel offers nine built-in IS information functions:
 
✦ ISBLANK(value) to evaluate whether the value or cell reference is empty
 
✦ ISERR(value) to evaluate whether the value or cell reference contains an 
Error value (except for #N/A)
 
✦ ISERROR(value) to evaluate whether the value or cell reference contains 
an Error value (including #N/A)
 
✦ ISLOGICAL(value) to evaluate whether the value or cell reference con-
tains the logical TRUE or FALSE value
 
✦ ISNA(value) to evaluate whether the value or cell reference contains the 
special #N/A Error value
 
✦ ISNONTEXT(value) to evaluate whether the value or cell reference con-
tains any type of entry other than text
 
✦ ISNUMBER(value) to evaluate whether the value or cell reference con-
tains a number
 
✦ ISREF(value) to evaluate whether the value or cell reference is itself a 
cell reference
 
✦ ISTEXT(value) to evaluate whether the value or cell reference contains a 
text entry
In addition to these nine IS functions, Excel adds two more, ISEVEN and 
ISODD, when you activate the Analysis ToolPak add-in. The ISEVEN function 
evaluates whether the number or reference to a cell containing a number 
is even, whereas the ISODD function evaluates whether it is odd. (For an 
example of how to use the ISERROR function, refer to the section on error 
trapping in Book III, Chapter 2.)
Much Ado about Text
Normally, when you think of doing calculations in a spreadsheet, you think 
of performing operations on its numeric entries. You can, however, use the 
text functions as well as the concatenation operator (&) to perform opera-
tions on its text entries as well (referred to collectively as string operations).
Using text functions
Text functions found on the Text command button’s drop-down menu on 
the Ribbon’s Formulas tab (Alt+MT) include two types of functions: func-
tions such as VALUE, TEXT, and DOLLAR that convert numeric text entries 
into numbers and numeric entries into text, and functions such as UPPER, 
LOWER, and PROPER that manipulate the strings of text themselves.

Much Ado about Text
Many times, you need to use the text functions when you work with data 
from other programs. For example, suppose that you purchase a target 
client list on disk, only to discover that all the information has been entered 
in all uppercase letters. In order to use this data with your word processor’s 
Mail merge feature, you would use Excel’s PROPER function to convert the 
entries so that only the initial letter of each word is in uppercase.
Text functions such as the UPPER, LOWER, and PROPER functions all take a 
single text argument that indicates the text that should be manipulated. The 
UPPER function converts all letters in the text argument to uppercase. The 
LOWER function converts all letters in the text argument to lowercase. The 
PROPER function capitalizes the first letter of each word as well as any other 
letters in the text argument that don’t follow another letter, and changes all 
other letters in the text argument to lowercase.
Figure 6-5 illustrates a situation in which you would use the PROPER func-
tion. Here, both last and first name text entries have been made in all upper-
case letters. Follow these steps for using the PROPER function to convert 
text entries to the proper capitalization:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in cell C3 and then click the Text command 
button on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab (or press Alt+MT) and then click 
PROPER on its drop-down menu.
 
 The Function Arguments dialog box for the PROPER function opens with 
the Text box selected.
 
2. Click cell A3 in the worksheet to insert A3 in the Text box of the 
Function Arguments dialog box and then click OK to insert the 
PROPER function into cell C3.
 
 Excel closes the Insert Function dialog box and inserts the formula 
=PROPER(A3) in cell C3, which now contains the proper capitalization 
of the last name Aiken.
 
3. Drag the Fill handle in the lower-right corner of cell C3 to the right to 
cell D3 and then release the mouse button to copy the formula with 
the PROPER function to this cell.
 
 Excel now copies the formula =PROPER(B3) to cell D3, which now con-
tains the proper capitalization of the first name, Christopher. Now you’re 
ready to copy these formulas with the PROPER function down to row 17.
 
4. Drag the fill handle in the lower-right corner of cell D3 down to cell 
D17, and then release the mouse button to copy the formulas with the 
PROPER function down.
 
 The cell range C3:D17 now contains first and last name text entries with 
the proper capitalization (see Figure 6-5). Before replacing all the upper-
case entries in A3:B17 with these proper entries, you convert them to 

418
Much Ado about Text
their calculated values. This action replaces the formulas with the text 
as though you had typed each name in the worksheet.
 
5. With the cell range C3:D17 still selected, click the Copy command 
button on the Home tab of the Ribbon.
 
6. Immediately click the Paste Values option on the Paste command but-
ton’s drop-down menu.
 
 You’ve now replaced the formulas with the appropriate text. Now 
you’re ready to move this range on top of the original range with the 
all-uppercase entries. This action will replace the uppercase entries 
with the ones using the proper capitalization.
 
7. With the cell range C3:D17 still selected, position the white-cross 
pointer on the bottom of the range; when the pointer changes to an 
arrowhead, drag the cell range until its outline encloses the range 
A3:B17, and then release the mouse button.
 
 Excel displays an alert box asking if you want the program to replace the 
contents of the destination’s cells.
 
8. Click OK in the Alert dialog box to replace the all-uppercase entries 
with the properly capitalized ones in the destination cells.
Your worksheet now looks like the one shown in Figure 6-6. Everything is 
fine in the worksheet with the exception of the two last names, Mcavoy and 
Mcclinton. You have to manually edit cells A11 and A12 to capitalize the A in 
McAvoy and the second C in McClinton.

Concatenating text
You can use the ampersand (&) operator to concatenate (or join) separate 
text strings together. For example, in the Client list spreadsheet shown in 
Figure 6-6, you can use this operator to join together the first and last names 
currently entered in two side-by-side cells into a single entry, as shown in 
Figure 6-7.
To join the first name entry in cell B3 with the last name entry in cell A3, I 
entered the following formula in cell C3:
=B3&” “&A3
Notice the use of the double quotes in this formula. They enclose a blank 
space that is placed between the first and last names joined to them with the 
two concatenation operators. If I don’t include this space in the formula and 
just join the first and last names together with this formula:
=B3&A3
Excel would return ChristopherAiken to cell C3, all as one word.
After entering the concatenation formula that joins the first and last names 
in cell C3 separated by a single space, I then drag the Fill handle in cell C3 
down to C17 to join all the other client names in a single cell in column C.

After the original concatenation formula is copied down the rows of column C, 
I copy the selected cell range C3:C17 to the Clipboard by clicking the Copy 
button in the Clipboard group of the Home tab on the Ribbon, and then 
immediately click the Paste Values option on the Paste command button’s 
drop-down menu. This pastes calculated text values over the concatenation 
formulas, thereby replacing the original formulas. The result is a list of first 
and last names together in the same cell in the range C3:C17, as though I had 
manually input each one.

efore you start sending out your spreadsheets for review (especially 
out of house), you need to make them secure. Security in Excel exists 
on two levels. The first is protecting the workbook file so that only people 
entrusted with the password can open the file to view, print, or edit the 
data. The second is protecting the worksheets in a workbook from unwar-
ranted changes so that only people entrusted with that password can make 
modifications to its contents and design.
When it comes to securing the integrity of your spreadsheets, you can 
decide which aspects of the sheets in the workbook your users can and 
cannot change. For example, you might prevent changes to all formulas and 
headings in a spreadsheet, while still enabling users to make entries in the 
cells referenced in the formulas themselves.
Password-Protecting the File
By password-protecting the workbook, you can prevent unauthorized users 
from opening the workbook and/or editing the workbook. You set a pass-
word for opening the workbook file when you’re dealing with a spreadsheet 
whose data is of a sufficiently sensitive nature that only a certain group 
of people in the company should have access to it (such as spreadsheets 
dealing with personal information and salaries). Of course, after you set the 
password required in order to open the workbook, you must supply this 
password to those people who need access in order to make it possible for 
them to open the workbook file.

424
You set a password for modifying the workbook when you’re dealing with a 
spreadsheet whose data needs to be viewed and printed by different users, 
none of whom are authorized to make changes to any of the entries. For 
example, you might assign a password for modifying a workbook before 
distributing it companywide, after the workbook’s been through a complete 
editing and review cycle and all the suggested changes have been merged 
(see Book IV, Chapter 3 for details).
If you’re dealing with a spreadsheet whose data is of a sensitive nature and 
should not be modified by anyone who’s authorized to open it, you need to 
set both a password for opening and a password for modifying the workbook 
file. You assign either one or both of these types of passwords to a work-
book file at the time you save it with the File➪Save As command (Alt+FA).
When you choose this command (or click the Save button on the Quick 
Access toolbar or press Ctrl+S for a new file that’s never been saved before), 
Excel opens the Save As dialog box. You can then set the password to open 
and/or the password to modify the file by taking these steps:
 
1. Click the Tools button in the Save As dialog box and then click 
General Options on its drop-down menu.
 
 Doing this opens the General Options dialog box, similar to the one 
shown in Figure 1-1, where you can enter a password to open and/or a 
password to modify in the File Sharing section. Your password can be as 
long as 255 characters, consisting of a combination of letters and num-
bers with spaces. When adding letters to your passwords, keep in mind 
that these passwords are case-sensitive. This means that opensesame 
and OpenSesame are not the same password because of the different 
use of upper- and lowercase letters.
 
 When entering a password, make sure that you don’t enter something 
that you can’t easily reproduce or, for heaven’s sake, that you can’t 
remember. You must be able to immediately reproduce the password in 
order to assign it, and you must be able to reproduce it later if you want 
to be able to open or change the darned workbook ever again.
 
2. (Optional) If you want to assign a password to open the file, type the 
password (up to 255 characters maximum) in the Password to Open 
text box.
 
 As you type the password, Excel masks the actual characters you type 
by rendering them as dots in the text box.
 
 If you decide to assign a password for opening and modifying the work-
book at the same time, proceed to Step 3. Otherwise, skip to Step 4.
 
 When entering the password for modifying the workbook, you want to 
assign a password that’s different from the one you just assigned for open-
ing the file (if you did assign a password for opening the file in this step).

3. (Optional) If you want to assign a password for modifying the work-
book, click the Password to Modify text box and then type the pass-
word for modifying the workbook there.
 
 Before you can assign a password to open the file and/or to modify 
the file, you must confirm the password by reproducing it in a Confirm 
Password dialog box exactly as you originally entered it.
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 Doing this closes the General Options dialog box and opens a Confirm 
Password dialog box, where you need to exactly reproduce the password. 
If you just entered a password in the Password to Open text box, you need 
to reenter this password in the Confirm Password dialog box. If you just 
entered a password in the Password to Modify text box, you need only to 
reproduce this password in the Confirm Password dialog box.
 
 However, if you entered a password in both the Password to Open text 
box and the Password to Modify text box, you must reproduce both 
passwords. In the first Confirm Password dialog box, enter the password 
you entered in the Password to Open text box. Immediately after you 
click OK in the first Confirm Password dialog box, the second Confirm 
Password dialog box appears, where you reproduce the password you 
entered in the Password to Modify text box.
 
5. Type the password exactly as you entered it in the Password to 
Open text box (or Password to Modify text box, if you didn’t use the 
Password to Open text box), and then click OK.
 
 If your password does not match exactly (in both characters and case) 
the one you originally entered, Excel displays an alert dialog box, indi-
cating that the confirmation password is not identical. When you click 
OK in this alert dialog box, Excel returns you to the original General 
Options dialog box where you can do one of two things:
 
• Reenter the password in the original text box.
 
• Click the OK button to redisplay the Confirm Password dialog box, 
where you can try again to reproduce the original. (Make sure that 
you’ve not engaged the Caps Lock key by accident.)
Password-Protecting the File

426
 
 If you assigned both a password to open the workbook and one to 
modify it, Excel displays a second Confirm Password dialog box as soon 
as you click OK in the first one and successfully reproduce the password 
to open the file. You then repeat Step 5, this time exactly reproducing 
the password to modify the workbook before you click OK.
 
 When you finish confirming the original password(s), you are ready to 
save the workbook in the Save As dialog box.
 
6. (Optional) If you want to save the password-protected version under a 
new filename or in a different folder, edit the name in the File Name 
text box and then select the new folder in the Save In drop-down list.
 
7. Click the Save button to save the workbook with the password to open 
and/or password to modify.
 
 As soon as you do this, Excel saves the file if this is the first time you’ve 
saved it. If not, the program displays an alert dialog box indicating 
that the file you’re saving already exists and asking you if you want to 
replace the existing file.
 
8. Click the Yes button if the alert dialog box that asks if you want to 
replace the existing file appears.
Entering the password to gain access
After you save a workbook file to which you’ve assigned a password for 
opening it, you must thereafter be able to faithfully reproduce the password 
in order to open the file (at least until you change or delete the password). 
When you next try to open the workbook, Excel opens a Password dialog 
box like the one shown in Figure 1-2, where you must enter the password 
exactly as it was assigned to the file.
If you mess up and type the wrong password, Excel displays an alert dialog 
box letting you know that the password you entered is incorrect. When you 
click OK to clear the alert, you are returned to the original Excel window 
where you must repeat the entire file opening procedure (hoping that this 
time you’re able to enter the correct password). When you supply the cor-
rect password, Excel immediately opens the workbook for viewing and 
printing (and editing as well, unless you’ve also assigned a password for 
modifying the file). If you’re unable to successfully reproduce the password, 
you are unable to open the file and put it to any use!
 
The last chance you have to chicken out of password-protecting the open-
ing of the file is before you close the file during the work session in which 
you originally assign the password. If, for whatever reason, you decide that 
you don’t want to go through the hassle of having to reproduce the pass-
word each and every time you open this file, you can get rid of it by click-
ing File➪Save As or pressing Alt+FA, clicking General Options on the Tools 
drop-down menu, and then deleting the password in the Password to Open 
text box before clicking OK in the General Options dialog box and the Save 
Password-Protecting the File

button in the Save As dialog box. Doing this re-saves the workbook file with-
out a password to open it so that you don’t have to worry about reproducing 
the password the next time you open the workbook for editing or printing.
 
Figure 1-2: 
Entering the

file.
 
 
A password-protected workbook file for which you can’t reproduce the cor-
rect password can be a real nightmare (especially if you’re talking about 
a really important spreadsheet with loads and loads of vital data). So for 
heaven’s sake, don’t forget your password, or you’ll be stuck. Excel does 
not provide any sort of command for overriding the password and opening 
a protected workbook, nor does Microsoft offer any such utility. If you think 
that you might forget the workbook’s password, be sure to write it down 
somewhere and then keep that piece of paper in a secure place, preferably 
under lock and key. It’s always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to 
passwords for opening files.
Entering the password to make changes
If you’ve protected your workbook from modifications, as soon as you 
attempt to open the workbook (and have entered the password to open the 
file, if one has been assigned), Excel immediately displays the Password 
dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 1-3, where you must accurately 
reproduce the password assigned for modifying the file.
 
Figure 1-3:

Password-Protecting the File

428
As when supplying the password to open a protected file, if you type the 
wrong password, Excel displays the alert dialog box letting you know that 
the password you entered is incorrect. When you click OK to clear the alert, 
you are returned to the Password dialog box where you can try reentering 
the password in the Password text box.
When you supply the correct password, Excel immediately closes the 
Password dialog box and you are free to edit the workbook in any way you 
wish (unless certain cell ranges or worksheets are protected). If you’re 
unable to successfully reproduce the password, you can click the Read Only 
command button, which opens a copy of the workbook file into which you 
can’t save your changes unless you use the File➪Save As command and then 
rename the workbook and/or locate the copy in a different folder.
When you click the Read Only button, Excel opens the file with a [Read-Only] 
indicator appended to the filename as it appears on the Excel title bar. If you 
then try to save changes with the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar 
or File➪Save command, the program displays an alert dialog box, indicating 
that the file is read-only and that you must save a copy by renaming the file 
in the Save As dialog box. As soon as you click OK to clear the alert dialog 
box, Excel displays the Save As dialog box where you can save the copy 
under a new filename and/or location. Note that the program automatically 
removes the password for modifying from the copy so that you can modify 
its contents anyway you like.
 
Because password-protecting a workbook against modification does not 
prevent you from opening the workbook and then saving an unprotected 
version under a new filename with the Save As command, you can assign 
passwords for modifying files without nearly as much trepidation as assign-
ing them for opening files. Assigning a password for modifying the file 
assures you that you’ll always have an intact original of the spreadsheet 
from which you can open and save a copy, even if you can never remember 
the password to modify the original itself.
Changing or deleting a password
Before you can change or delete a password for opening a workbook, you 
must first be able to supply the current password you want to change to 
get the darned thing open. Assuming you can do this, all you have to do to 
change or get rid of the password is open the Save As dialog box (File➪Save 
As or Alt+FA), and then click the General Options item on the Tools drop-
down menu to open the General Options dialog box, which opens with the 
password in the Password to Open text box selected.
To delete the password, simply press the Delete key to remove all the aster-
isks from this text box. To reassign the password, replace the current pass-
word with the new one you want to assign by typing it over the original one.

Then, when you click OK in the General Options dialog box, reenter the new 
password in the Confirm Password dialog box and then click its OK button.
Finally, after closing the General Options dialog box, you simply click the 
Save button in the Save As dialog box and then click Yes in the alert dialog 
box, which asks you if you want to replace the existing file.
To change or delete the password for modifying the workbook, you follow 
the same procedure, except that you have to be able to successfully repro-
duce the password for modifying the workbook after opening it, and then 
change or delete the password that’s entered into the Password to Modify 
text box in the General Options dialog box.
Protecting the Spreadsheet
After you’ve got the worksheet the way you want it, you often need the help 
of Excel’s Protection feature to keep it that way. Nothing’s worse than having 
an inexperienced data entry operator doing major damage to the formulas 
and functions that you’ve worked so hard to build and validate. To keep 
the formulas and standard text in a spreadsheet safe from any unwarranted 
changes, you need to protect the worksheet.
Before you start using the Protect Sheet and Protect Workbook command 
buttons on the Review tab of the Ribbon, you need to understand how pro-
tection works in Excel. All cells in the workbook can have one of two differ-
ent protection formats: locked or unlocked, and hidden or unhidden.
Whenever you begin a new spreadsheet, all the cells in the workbook have 
the locked and unhidden status. However, this status in and of itself means 
nothing until you turn on protection with the Protect Sheet and Protect 
Workbook command buttons on the Review tab. At that time, you are then 
prevented from making any editing changes to all locked cells and from 
viewing the contents of all hidden cells on the Formula bar when they con-
tain the cell cursor.
What this means in practice is that, prior to turning on worksheet protec-
tion, you go through the spreadsheet removing the Locked protection 
format from all the cell ranges where you or your users need to be able to 
do data entry and editing even when the worksheet is protected. You also 
assign the Hidden protection format to all cell ranges in the spreadsheet 
where you don’t want the contents of the cell to be displayed when protec-
tion is turned on in the worksheet. Then, when that formatting is done, you 
activate protection for all the remaining Locked cells and block the Formula 
bar display for all the Hidden cells in the sheet.
Protecting the Spreadsheet

When setting up your own spreadsheet templates, you will want to unlock all 
the cells where users need to input new data and keep locked all the cells 
that contain headings and formulas that never change. You may also want to 
hide cells with formulas if you’re concerned that their display might tempt 
the users to waste time trying to fiddle with or finesse them. Then, turn on 
worksheet protection prior to saving the file in the template file format (see 
Book II, Chapter 1, for details). You are then assured that all spreadsheets 
generated from that template automatically inherit the same level and type 
of protection as you assigned in the original spreadsheet.
Changing the Locked and Hidden cell formatting
To change the status of cells from locked to unlocked or from unhidden to 
hidden, you use the Locked and Hidden check boxes found on the Protection 
tab of the Format Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1).
To remove the Locked protection status from a cell range or nonadjacent 
selection, you follow these two steps:
 
1. Select the range or ranges to be unlocked.
 
 To select multiple ranges to create a nonadjacent cell selection, hold 
down the Ctrl key as you drag through each range.
 
2. Click the Format command button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and then 
click the Lock option near the bottom of its drop-down menu or press 
Alt+HOL.
Excel lets you know that the cells in the selected range are no longer locked 
by removing the highlighting from the lock icon in front of the Lock option 
on the Format button’s drop-down menu.
You can also change the protection status of a selected range of cells with 
the Locked check box on the Protection tab of the Format Cells dialog box. 
Simply open the Format Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1), click the Protection tab, 
and then click the Locked check box to remove the check mark before you 
click OK.
To hide the display of the contents of the cells in the current selection, 
you click the Hidden check box instead of the Locked check box on the 
Protection tab of the Format Cells dialog box before you click OK.
 
Remember that changing the protection formatting of cell ranges in the 
worksheet (as described above) does nothing in and of itself. It’s not until 
you turn on the protection for your worksheet (as outlined in the next sec-
tion) that your unlocked and hidden cells work or appear any differently 
from the locked and unhidden cells. At that time, only unlocked cells accept 
edits, and only unhidden cells display their contents on the Formula bar 
when they contain the cell cursor.

Protecting the worksheet
When you’ve gotten all cell ranges that you want unlocked and hidden cor-
rectly formatted in the worksheet, you’re ready to turn on protection. To do 
this, you click the Protect Sheet command button on the Ribbon’s Review tab 
or press Alt+RPS to open the Protect Sheet dialog box, shown in Figure 1-4.
When you first open this dialog box, only the Protect Worksheet and 
Contents of Locked Cells check box at the very top and the Select Locked 
Cells and Select Unlocked Cells check boxes in the Allow All Users of This 
Worksheet To list box are selected. All the other check box options (includ-
ing a number that are not visible without scrolling up the Allow All Users of 
This Worksheet To list box) are unselected.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Selecting 
the 
protection 
options in 
the Protect 
Sheet dialog 
box.
 
This means that if you click OK at this point, the only things that you’ll be 
permitted to do in the worksheet are edit unlocked cells and select cell 
ranges (of any type: both locked and unlocked alike).
 
If you really want to keep other users out of all the locked cells in a work-
sheet, click the Select Locked Cells check box in the Allow All Users of This 
Worksheet To list box to remove its check mark. That way, your users are 
completely restricted to just those unlocked ranges where you permit data 
input and content editing.
 
Don’t, however, deselect the Select Unlocked Cells check box as well as the 
Select Locked Cells check box, because doing this makes the cell cursor dis-
appear from the worksheet, making the cell address in the Name Box on the 
Formula bar the sole way for you and your users to keep track of their posi-
tion in the worksheet (which is, believe me, the quickest way to drive you 
and your users stark raving mad).
Selecting what actions are allowed in a protected sheet
In addition to enabling users to select locked and unlocked cells in the work-
sheet, you can enable the following actions in the protected worksheet by 
Protecting the Spreadsheet

432
selecting their check boxes in the Allow All Users of This Worksheet To list 
box of the Protect Sheet dialog box:
 
✦ Format Cells: Enables the formatting of cells (with the exception of 
changing the locked and hidden status on the Protection tab of the 
Format Cells dialog box).
 
✦ Format Columns: Enables formatting so that users can modify the 
column widths and hide and unhide columns.
 
✦ Format Rows: Enables formatting so that users can modify the row 
heights and hide and unhide rows.
 
✦ Insert Columns: Enables the insertion of new columns in the worksheet.
 
✦ Insert Rows: Enables the insertion of new rows in the worksheet.
 
✦ Insert Hyperlinks: Enables the insertion of new hyperlinks to other doc-
uments, both local and on the Web. (See Book IV, Chapter 2, for details.)
 
✦ Delete Columns: Enables the deletion of columns in the worksheet.
 
✦ Delete Rows: Enables the deletion of rows in the worksheet.
 
✦ Sort: Enables the sorting of data in unlocked cells in the worksheet. (See 
Book VI, Chapter 1, for details.)
 
✦ Use AutoFilter: Enables the filtering of data in the worksheet. (See Book 
VI, Chapter 2, for more information.)
 
✦ Use PivotTable Reports: Enables the manipulation of pivot tables in the 
worksheet. (For more about pivot tables, see Book VII, Chapter 2.)
 
✦ Edit Objects: Enables the editing of graphic objects, such as text 
boxes, embedded images, and the like, in the worksheet. (See Book V, 
Chapter 2, for details.)
 
✦ Edit Scenarios: Enables the editing of what-if scenarios, including modi-
fying and deleting them. (For details of what-if scenarios, see Book VII, 
Chapter 1.)
Assigning a password to unprotect the sheet
In addition to enabling particular actions in the protected worksheet, you can 
also assign a password that’s required in order to remove the protections 
from the protected worksheet. When entering a password in the Password 
to Unprotect Sheet text box of the Protect Sheet dialog box, you observe the 
same guidelines as when assigning a password to open or to make changes in 
the workbook (255 characters maximum that can consist of a combination of 
letters, numbers, and spaces, with the letters being case sensitive).
As with assigning a password to open or make changes to a workbook, when 
you enter a password (whose characters are masked with asterisks) in the 
Password to Unprotect Sheet text box and then click OK, Excel displays the 
Protecting the Spreadsheet

Book IV
Chapter 1
Protecting 
Workbooks and 
Worksheet Data
433
Confirm Password dialog box. Here, you must accurately reproduce the 
password you just entered (including upper- and lowercase letters) before 
Excel turns on the sheet protection and assigns the password for removing 
protection.
If you don’t successfully reproduce the password, when you click OK in 
the Confirm Password dialog box, Excel replaces it with an alert dialog box 
indicating that the confirmation password is not identical to the one you 
entered in the Protect Sheet dialog box. When you click OK to clear this alert 
dialog box, you are returned to the Protect Sheet dialog box, where you may 
modify the password in the Password to Unprotect Sheet text box before 
you click OK and try confirming the password again.
As soon as you accurately reproduce the password in the Confirm Password 
dialog box, Excel closes the Protect Sheet dialog box and enables protection 
for that sheet, using whatever settings you designated in that dialog box.
 
If you don’t assign a password to unprotect the sheet, any user with a modi-
cum of Excel knowledge can lift the worksheet protection and make any 
manner of changes to its contents, including wreaking havoc on its compu-
tational abilities by corrupting its formulas. Keep in mind that it makes little 
sense to turn on the protection in a worksheet if you’re going to permit any-
body to turn it off by simply clicking the Unprotect Sheet command button 
on the Review tab (which automatically replaces the Protect Sheet command 
button as soon as you turn on protection in the worksheet).
Removing protection from a worksheet
When you assign protection to a sheet, your input and editing are restricted 
solely to unlocked cells in the worksheet, and you can perform only those 
additional actions that you enabled in the Allow Users of this Worksheet To 
list box. If you try to replace, delete, or otherwise modify a locked cell in the 
protected worksheet, Excel displays an alert dialog box with the following 
message:
The cell or chart you are trying to change is protected 
and therefore read-only
The message then goes on to tell you that to modify a protected worksheet, 
you must first remove the protection by using the Unprotect Sheet com-
mand button in the Changes group on the Review tab.
If you’ve assigned a password to unprotect the sheet, when you click the 
Unprotect Sheet button, the program displays the Unprotect Sheet dialog 
box where you must enter the password exactly as you assigned it. As soon 
as you remove the protection by entering the correct password in this dialog 
box and clicking OK, Excel turns off the protection in the sheet, and you can 
Protecting the Spreadsheet

434
once again make any kinds of modifications to its structure and contents in 
both the locked and unlocked cells.
 
Keep in mind that when you protect a worksheet, only the data and graphics 
on that particular worksheet are protected. This means that you can modify 
the data and graphics on other sheets of the same workbook without remov-
ing protection. If you have data or graphics on other sheets of the same 
workbook that also need protecting, you need to activate that sheet and 
then repeat the entire procedure for protecting it as well (including unlock-
ing cells that need to be edited and selecting which other actions, if any, to 
enable in the worksheet, and whether to assign a password to unprotect 
the sheet) before distributing the workbook. When assigning passwords to 
unprotect the various sheets of the workbook, you may want to stick with 
a single password rather than have to worry about remembering a different 
password for each sheet, which is a bit much, don’t you think?
Enabling cell range editing by certain users
You can use the Allow Users to Edit Ranges command button in the Changes 
group on the Review tab of the Ribbon to enable the editing of particular 
ranges in the protected worksheet by certain users. When you use this 
feature, you give certain users permission to edit particular cell ranges, pro-
vided that they can correctly provide the password you assign to that range.
To give access to particular ranges in a protected worksheet, you follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Allow Users to Edit Ranges command button on the Ribbon’s 
Review tab or press Alt+RU.
 
 Note that the Allow Users to Edit Ranges command button is grayed out 
and unavailable if the worksheet is currently protected. In that case, 
you must remove protection by clicking the Unprotect Sheet command 
button on the Review tab before you retry Step 1.
 
 Excel opens the Allow Users to Edit Ranges dialog box where you can 
add the ranges you want to assign, as shown in Figure 1-5.

2. Click the New button.
 
 Doing this opens the New Range dialog box where you give the range a 
title, define its cell selection, and provide the range password, as shown 
in Figure 1-6.
 
Figure 1-6:

3. If you wish, type a name for the range in the Title text box (otherwise, 
Excel assigns a name such as Range1, Range2, and so on).
 
 Next, you designate the cell range or nonadjacent cell selection to which 
access is restricted.
 
4. Click the Refers to Cells text box and then type in the address of the 
cell range (without removing the = sign) or select the range or ranges 
in the worksheet.
 
 Next, you need to enter a password that’s required to get access to the 
range. Like all other passwords in Excel, this one can be up to 255 char-
acters long, mixing letters, numbers, and spaces. Pay attention to the 
use of upper- and lowercase letters because the range password is case-
sensitive.
 
5. Type in the password for accessing the range in the Range Password 
dialog box.
 
 You need to use the Permissions button in the New Range dialog box to 
open the Permissions dialog box for the range you’re setting.
 
6. Click the Permissions button in the Range Password dialog box.
 
 Next, you need to add the users who are to have access to this range.
 
7. Click the Add button in the Permissions dialog box.
 
 Doing this opens the Select Users or Groups dialog box, where you des-
ignate the names of the users to have access to the range.

8. Click the name of the user in the Enter the Object Names to Select list 
box at the bottom of the Select Users or Groups dialog box. To select 
multiple users from this list, hold down the Ctrl key as you click each 
user name.
 
 If this list box is empty, click the Advanced button to expand the Select 
Users or Groups dialog box and then click the Find Now button to locate 
all users for your location. You can then click the name or Ctrl+click the 
names you want to add from this list, and then when you click OK, Excel 
returns you to the original form of the Select Users or Groups dialog box 
and adds these names to its Enter the Object Names to Select list box.
 
9. Click OK in the Select Users or Groups dialog box.
 
 Doing this returns you to the Permissions dialog box where the names 
you’ve selected are now listed in the Group or User Names list box. Now 
you need to set the permissions for each user. When you first add users, 
each one is permitted to edit the range without a password. To restrict 
the editing to only those who have the range password, you need to 
click each name and then click the Deny check box.
 
10. Click the name of the first user who must know the password and then 
click the Deny check box in the Permissions For list box.
 
 You need to repeat Step 10 for each person in the Group or Users Names 
list box that you want to restrict in this manner (see Figure 1-7).
 
Figure 1-7:

11. Repeat Step 10 for each user who must know the password and then 
click OK in the Permissions dialog box.
 
 As soon as you click OK, Excel displays a warning alert dialog box, letting 
you know that you are setting a deny permission that takes precedence 
over any allowed entries, so that if the person is a member of two groups, 
one with an allow entry and the other with a deny entry, the deny entry 
permission rules (meaning that they have to know the range password).

12. Click the Yes button in the Security alert dialog box.
 
 Doing this closes this dialog box and returns you to the New Range

13. Click OK in the New Range dialog box.
 
 Doing this opens the Confirm Password dialog box where you must 
accurately reproduce the range password.
 
14. Type the range password in the Reenter Password to Proceed text box 
and then click the OK button.
 
 Doing this returns you to the Allow Users to Edit Ranges dialog box 
where the title and cell reference of the new range is displayed in the

shown in Figure 1-8.

dialog box.
 
 
 If you need to define other ranges available to other users in the work-
sheet, you can do so by repeating Steps 2 through 14.
 
 When you finish adding ranges to the Allow Users to Edit Ranges dialog 
box, you’re ready to protect the worksheet. If you want to retain a 
record of the ranges you’ve defined, go to Step 15. Otherwise, skip to 
Step 16.
 
15. (Optional) Click the Paste Permissions Information Into a New 
Workbook check box to put a check mark in it if you want to create a 
new workbook that contains all the permissions information.
 
 When you select this check box, Excel creates a new workbook whose 
first worksheet lists all the ranges you’ve assigned, along with the users 
who may gain access by providing the range password. You can then 
save this workbook for your records. Note that the range password is 
not listed on this worksheet — if you want to add it, be sure that you 
password-protect the workbook so that only you can open it.
 
 Now, you’re ready to protect the worksheet. If you want to do this from 
within the Allow Users to Edit Ranges dialog box, you click the Protect 
Protecting the Spreadsheet

438
Sheet button to open the Protect Sheet dialog box. If you want to protect 
the worksheet later on, you click OK to close the Allow Users to Edit 
Ranges dialog box and then click the Protect Sheet command button on 
the Review tab of the Ribbon (or press Alt+RPS) when you’re ready to 
activate the worksheet protection.
 
16. Click the Protect Sheet button to protect the worksheet; otherwise, 
click the OK button to close the Allow Users to Edit Ranges dialog box.
If you click the Protect Sheet button, Excel opens the Protect Sheet dialog 
box where you can set a password to unprotect the sheet. This dialog box is 
also where you select the actions that you permit all users to perform in the 
protected worksheet (as outlined earlier in this chapter).
After you turn on protection in the worksheet, only the users you’ve desig-
nated are able to edit the cell range or ranges you’ve defined. Of course, you 
need to supply the range password to all the users allowed to do editing in 
the range or ranges at the time you distribute the workbook to them.
 
Be sure to assign a password to unprotect the worksheet at the time you 
protect the worksheet if you want to prevent unauthorized users from being 
able to make changes to the designated editing ranges in the worksheet. If 
you don’t, any user can make changes by turning off the worksheet protec-
tion and thereby gaining access to the Allow Users to Edit Ranges command 
by clicking the Unprotect Sheet command button on the Review tab of the 
Ribbon.
Doing data entry in the unlocked 
cells of a protected worksheet
The best part of protecting a worksheet is that you and your users can jump 
right to unlocked cells and avoid even dealing with the locked ones (that 
you can’t change, anyway) by using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys to navigate 
the worksheet. When you press the Tab key in a protected worksheet, Excel 
jumps the cell cursor to the next unlocked cell to the right of the current one 
in that same row. When you reach the last unlocked cell in that row, the pro-
gram then jumps to the first unlocked cell in the rows below. To move back 
to a previous unlocked cell, you press Shift+Tab. When Excel reaches the 
last unlocked cell in the spreadsheet, it automatically jumps back to the very 
first unlocked cell on the sheet.
Of course, provided that you haven’t changed the behavior of the Enter key 
in the Editing Options section on the Advanced tab of the Excel Options 
dialog box (File➪Options or Alt+FI), you can also use the Enter key to move 
down the columns instead of across the rows. However, pressing the Enter 
key to progress down a column selects locked cells in that column as well as 
the unlocked ones, whereas pressing the Tab key skips all those cells with 
the Locked protection format.

Figure 1-9 illustrates how you can put the Tab key to good use in filling out 
and navigating a protected worksheet. This figure shows the original Spa 
Holiday Hot Tubs invoice template. Because this invoice worksheet in the 
original template is protected all worksheets generated from the template 
will be protected as well. The only cells that are unlocked in this sheet are 
the cells in the following ranges: C3:E5, C6, E6, G5, and B8:E15. All the rest of 
the cells in this worksheet are locked and off limits.

To fill in the data for this new invoice, you can press the Tab key to com-
plete the data entry in each field such as Date, Invoice #, Name, Street 
Address, and so on. By pressing Tab, you don’t have to waste time moving 
through the locked cells that contain headings that you can’t modify 
anyway. If you need to back up and return to the previous field in the 
invoice, you just press Shift+Tab to go back to the previous unlocked cell.
 
If you want to make it impossible for the user to select anything but the 
unlocked cells in the protected worksheet, you can do so by removing the 
check mark from the Select Locked Cells check box in the Allow All Users of 
This Worksheet To list box of the Protect Sheet dialog box.
Protecting the workbook
There is one last level of protection that you can apply to your spreadsheet 
files, and that is protecting the entire workbook. When you protect the 
Protecting the Spreadsheet

440
workbook, you ensure that its users can’t change the structure of the file 
by adding, deleting, or even moving and renaming any of its worksheets. To 
protect your workbook, you click the Protect Workbook command button 
on the Ribbon’s Review tab followed by the Protect Structure and Windows 
option on its drop-down menu (press Alt+RPWW).
Excel displays a Protect Structure and Windows dialog box like the one 
shown in Figure 1-10. This dialog box contains two check boxes: Structure 
(which is automatically checked) and Windows (which is not selected). This 
dialog box also contains a Password (Optional) text box where you can enter 
a password that must be supplied before you can unprotect the workbook. 
Like every other password in Excel, the password to unprotect the work-
book can be up to 255 characters maximum, consisting of a combination of 
letters, numbers, and spaces, with all the letters being case-sensitive.
 
Figure 1-10: 
Protecting a 
workbook in 
the Protect 
Structure 
and 
Windows 
dialog box.
 
When you protect a workbook with the Structure check box selected, Excel 
prevents you or your users from doing any of the following tasks to the file:
 
✦ Inserting new worksheets
 
✦ Deleting existing worksheets
 
✦ Renaming worksheets
 
✦ Hiding or viewing hidden worksheets
 
✦ Moving or copying worksheets to another workbook
 
✦ Displaying the source data for a cell in a pivot table or displaying 
a table’s Report Filter fields on separate worksheets (see Book VII, 
Chapter 2, for details)
 
✦ Creating a summary report with the Scenario Manager (see Book VII, 
Chapter 1, for details)
When you turn on protection for a workbook after checking the Windows 
check box in the Protect Structure and Windows dialog box, Excel prevents 
you from changing the size or position of the workbook’s windows (not usu-
ally something you need to control).
Protecting the Spreadsheet

441
After you’ve enabled protection in a workbook, you can then turn it off 
by choosing the Protect Structure and Windows option on the Unprotect 
Workbook command button’s drop-down menu or by pressing Alt+RPWW 
again. If you’ve assigned a password to unprotect the workbook, you must 
accurately reproduce it in the Password text box in the Unprotect Workbook 
dialog box that then appears.
Protecting a shared workbook
Many times you will want to protect a workbook that you intend to share on 
a network. That way, you can allow simultaneous editing of the contents of its 
worksheets (assuming that you don’t also protect individual sheets), while at 
the same time preventing anybody but you from removing the Change track-
ing (and thus deleting the Change History log — see Book IV, Chapter 3).
If the workbook is not currently shared, you can both protect the work-
book and share it by clicking the Protect Sharing command button on the 
Ribbon’s Review tab or by pressing Alt+RO. Note that if the workbook is 
already shared, you must stop sharing the file before you can use this com-
mand (see Book IV, Chapter 1, for details on how to do this).
When you click the Protect Sharing command button, Excel opens the 
Protect Shared Workbook dialog box, similar to the one shown in Figure 
1-11. In this dialog box, you click the Sharing with Track Changes check box 
to enable file sharing and to turn on the Change tracking. As soon as you 
click this check box to put a check mark in it, Excel makes available the 
Password (Optional) text box where you can enter a password that must be 
supplied before you can stop sharing the workbook.
 
Figure 1-11:

dialog box.
 
If you enter a password in this text box (and you should — otherwise, 
there’s little reason to use this option, because anyone can remove the 
protection from the shared workbook and thus stop the file sharing), Excel 
immediately displays the Confirm Password dialog box where you must 
accurately reproduce the password.
Protecting the Spreadsheet

442
When you do this, Excel displays an alert dialog box that informs you that 
it will now save the workbook, and when you click the Yes button, the pro-
gram saves the workbook as a shared file and protects it from being made 
exclusive without the password. The program also adds a [Shared] indicator 
to the filename at the top of the Excel program window to let you know that 
the workbook is being shared.
 
To remove the protection from the shared workbook and, at the same time, 
stop sharing it, you choose the Unprotect Shared Workbook command 
button (that replaces the Protect Sharing button) in the Changes group on 
the Review tab of the Ribbon. After you enter the password to unprotect 
the file in the Unprotect Sharing dialog box and click OK, Excel displays an 
alert dialog box, informing you that your action is about to remove the file 
from shared use and erase the Change History log file. If you click Yes, you 
prevent users who are currently editing the workbook from saving their 
changes. If you’re sure that no one else is using the workbook, you can con-
tinue and remove the file sharing by clicking the Yes button.

Chapter 2: Linking Workbooks 
with Hyperlinks
In This Chapter
✓ Linking your spreadsheet to other Excel workbooks, Office documents, 
and Web pages
✓ Linking to e-mail addresses
✓ Following the links that you create in the worksheet
✓ Editing hyperlinks in a worksheet
✓ Creating formulas that use the HYPERLINK function
T
he subject of this chapter is linking your worksheet with other docu-
ments through the use of hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are the kinds of links 
used on the Web to take you immediately from one Web page to another or 
from one Web site to another. Such links can be attached to text (thus the 
term, hypertext) or to graphics such as buttons or pictures. The most impor-
tant aspect of a hyperlink is that it immediately takes you to its destination 
whenever you click the text or button to which it is attached.
In an Excel worksheet, you can create hyperlinks that take you to a different 
part of the same worksheet, to another worksheet in the same workbook, 
to another workbook or other type of document on your hard drive, or to a 
Web page on your company’s intranet or on the World Wide Web.
Hyperlinks 101
To add hyperlinks in an Excel worksheet, you must define two things:
 
✦ The object to which you want to anchor the link and then click to 
activate
 
✦ The destination to which the link takes you when activated
The objects to which you can attach hyperlinks include any text that you 
enter into a cell or any graphic object that you draw or import into the 
worksheet (see Book V, Chapter 2, for details on adding graphics to your 
worksheet). The destinations that you can specify for links can be a new cell 
or range, the same workbook file, or another file outside the workbook.

444
The destinations that you can specify for hyperlinks that take you to another 
place in the same workbook file include
 
✦ The cell reference of a cell on any of the worksheets in the workbook 
that you want to go to when you click the hyperlink.
 
✦ The range name of the group of cells that you want to select when you 
click the hyperlink. The range name must already exist at the time you 
create the link.
The destinations that you can specify for hyperlinks that take you outside 
the current workbook include
 
✦ The filename of an existing file that you want to open when you click 
the hyperlink. This file can be another workbook file or any other type of 
document that your computer can open.
 
✦ The URL address of a Web page that you want to visit when you click 
the hyperlink. This page can be on your company’s intranet or on the 
World Wide Web and is opened in your Web browser.
 
✦ A new document that you want to create in Excel or some other pro-
gram on your computer when you click the hyperlink. You must specify 
the filename and file extension (which indicates what type of document 
to create and what program to launch).
 
✦ An e-mail address for a new message that you want to create in your 
e-mail program when you click the hyperlink. You must specify the 
recipient’s e-mail address and the subject of the new message when you 
create the link.
Adding hyperlinks
The steps for creating a new hyperlink in the worksheet are very straight-
forward. The only thing you need to do beforehand is to add the jump text 
in the cell where you want the link or to draw or import the graphic object 
to which the link is to be attached (as described in Book V, Chapter 2). 
Then, to add a hyperlink to the text in this cell or the graphic object, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in the cell containing the text or click the 
graphic object to which you want to anchor the hyperlink.
 
 After you have selected the cell with the text or the graphic object, 
you’re ready to open the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
 
2. Click the Hyperlink command button on the Ribbon’s Insert tab or 
press Alt+NI or Ctrl+K.
 
 The Insert Hyperlink dialog box opens (similar to the one shown in Figure 
2-1). If you selected a graphic object or a cell that contains some entry 
besides text before opening this dialog box, you notice that the Text to 
Hyperlinks 101

Book IV
Chapter 2
Linking Workbooks 
with Hyperlinks
445
Display text box contains <<Selection in Document>> and that this box is 
grayed out (because there isn’t any text to edit when anchoring a link to 
a graphic). If you selected a cell with a text entry, that entry appears in 
the Text to Display text box. You can edit this text in this box; however, 
be aware that any change that you make to it here is reflected in the cur-
rent cell when you close the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
 
 The ScreenTip button located to the immediate right of the Text to 
Display text box enables you to add text describing the function of the 
link when you position the mouse pointer over the cell or graphic object 
to which the link is attached. To add a ScreenTip for your link, follow 
Step 3. Note that if you don’t add your own ScreenTip, Excel automati-
cally creates its own ScreenTip that lists the destination of the new link 
when you position the mouse pointer on its anchor.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Creating 
a new 
hyperlink in 
the Insert 
Hyperlink 
dialog box.
 
 
3. (Optional) Click the ScreenTip button and then type the text that 
you want to appear next to the mouse pointer in the Set Hyperlink 
ScreenTip dialog box before you click OK.
 
 By default, Excel selects the Existing File or Web Page button in the Link 
To area on the left side of the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, thus enabling 
you to assign the link destination to a file on your hard disk or to a Web 
page. To link to a cell or cell range in the current workbook, click the 
Place in This Document button. To link to a new document, click the 
Create New Document button. To link to a new e-mail message, click the 
E-Mail Address button.
 
4. Select the type of destination for the new link by clicking its button in 
the Link To panel on the left side of the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
 
 Now all that you need to do is to specify the destination for your link. 
How you do this depends on which type of link you’re adding; see the 
following instructions for details.
 
• Linking to a cell or named range in the current workbook: After click-
ing the Place in This Document button in the Link To panel, enter the 
address of the cell to link to in the Type the Cell Reference text box and 
Hyperlinks 101

446
then click the name of the sheet that contains this cell listed under the 
Cell Reference range in the Or Select a Place in This Document list box. 
To link to a named range, simply click its name under Defined Names in 
the Or Select a Place in This Document list box.
 
• Linking to an existing file: After clicking the Existing File or Web 
Page button in the Link To panel, open its folder in the Look In drop-
down list box and then click its file icon in the list box that appears 
immediately below this box. If you’re linking to a Web page, click the 
Address text box and enter the URL address (as in http:// and so 
on) there. If the file or Web page that you select contains bookmarks 
(or range names, in the case of another Excel workbook) that name 
specific locations in the file to which you link, click the Bookmark 
button and then click the name of the location (bookmark) in the 
Select Place in Document dialog box before you click OK.
 
• Creating a new document: After clicking the Create New Document 
button in the Link To panel, enter a filename for the new document 
in the Name of New Document text box. Include the three-letter 
filename extension if this new document is not an Excel workbook, 
such as .doc to create a new Word document or .txt to create a 
new text file. To specify a different folder in which to create the new 
document, click the Change button to the right of the current path 
and then select the appropriate drive and folder in the Create New 
Document dialog box and click OK. If you want to edit the contents of 
the new document right away, leave the Edit the New Document Now 
option button selected. If you prefer to edit the new document at a 
later time, click the Edit the New Document Later option button.
 
• Creating a new e-mail message: After clicking the E-Mail Address 
button in the Link To panel, enter the e-mail address (as in 
gharvey@mindovermedia.com) in the E-Mail Address text box 
and then click the Subject text box and enter the subject of the new 
e-mail message.
 
5. Specify the destination for the new hyperlink by using the text boxes 
and list boxes that appear for the type of link destination that you 
selected.
 
 Now you’re ready to create the link.
 
6. Click the OK button in the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
As soon as you click OK, Excel closes the Insert Hyperlink dialog box and 
returns you to the worksheet with the new link (unless you specified that the 
new link is to create a new document and you left the Edit New Document 
Now option button selected, in which case, you’re in a new document — 
possibly in another application program such as Microsoft Word). If you 
anchored your new hyperlink to a graphic object, that object is still selected 
in the worksheet (to deselect the object, click a cell outside its boundaries). 
Hyperlinks 101

Book IV
Chapter 2
Linking Workbooks 
with Hyperlinks
447
If you anchored your hyperlink to text in the current cell, the text now 
appears in blue and is underlined (you may not be able to see the underlin-
ing until you move the cell cursor out of the cell).
When you position the mouse pointer over the cell with the hypertext or the 
graphic object with the hyperlink, the mouse pointer changes from a thick, 
white cross to a hand with the index finger pointing upward. The ScreenTip 
that you assigned appears below and to the right of the hand mouse pointer.
If you didn’t assign your own ScreenTip to the hyperlink when creating it, 
Excel adds its own message that shows the URL destination of the link. If 
the link is a hypertext link (that is, if it’s anchored to a cell containing a text 
entry), the message in the ScreenTip also adds the following message:
Click once to follow. Click and hold to select this cell.
Follow that link!
To follow a hyperlink, click the link text or graphic object with the hand 
mouse pointer. Excel then takes you to the destination. If the destination is a 
cell in the workbook, Excel makes that cell current. If the destination is a cell 
range, Excel selects the range and makes the first cell of the range current. 
If this destination is a document created with another application program, 
Excel launches the application program (assuming that it’s available on the 
current computer). If this destination is a Web page on the World Wide Web, 
Excel launches your Web browser, connects you to the Internet, and then 
opens the page in the browser.
After you follow a hypertext link to its destination, the color of its text 
changes from the traditional blue to a dark shade of purple (without affect-
ing its underlining). This color change indicates that the hyperlink has been 
followed (note, however, that graphic hyperlinks don’t show any change in 
color after you follow them). Followed hypertext links regain their original 
blue color when you reopen their workbooks in Excel.
Editing hyperlinks
 
Excel makes it easy to edit any hyperlink that you’ve added to your spread-
sheet. The only trick to editing a link is that you have to be careful not 
to activate the link during the editing process. This means that you must 
always remember to right-click the link’s hypertext or graphic to select the 
link that you want to edit because clicking results only in activating the link.
When you right-click a link, Excel displays its shortcut menu. If you want to 
modify the link’s destination or ScreenTip, click Edit Hyperlink on this shortcut 
menu. This action opens the Edit Hyperlink dialog box with the same options 
as the Insert Hyperlink dialog box (shown previously in Figure 2-1). You can 
then use the Link To buttons on the left side of the dialog box to modify the 
link’s destination or the ScreenTip button to add or change the ScreenTip text.
Hyperlinks 101

448
Removing a hyperlink
If you want to remove the hyperlink from a cell entry or graphic object without 
getting rid of the text entry or the graphic, right-click the cell or graphic and 
then click the Remove Hyperlink item on the cell’s or object’s shortcut menu.
If you want to clear the cell of both its link and text entry, click the Delete 
item on the cell’s shortcut menu. To get rid of a graphic object along with 
its hyperlink, right-click the object (this action opens its shortcut menu) 
and then immediately click the object to remove the shortcut menu without 
either deselecting the graphic or activating the hyperlink. At this point, you 
can press the Delete key to delete both the graphic and the associated link.
Copying and moving a hyperlink
When you need to copy or move a hyperlink to a new place in the work-
sheet, you can use either the drag-and-drop or the cut-and-paste method. 
Again, the main challenge to using either method is selecting the link with-
out activating it because clicking the cell or graphic object containing the 
link only results in catapulting you over to the link’s destination point.
To select a cell that contains hypertext, use the arrow keys to position the 
cell cursor in that cell or use the Go To feature (F5 or Ctrl+G) and enter 
the cell’s address in the Go To dialog box to move the cell cursor there. To 
select a graphic object that contains a hyperlink, right-click the graphic to 
select it as well as to display its shortcut menu, and then immediately click 
the graphic (with the left mouse button) to remove the shortcut menu while 
keeping the object selected.
After you have selected the cell or graphic with the hyperlink, you can move 
the link by clicking the Cut command button on the Home tab of the Ribbon 
(Ctrl+X) or copy it by clicking the Copy command button (Ctrl+C) and then 
paste it into its new position by clicking the Paste command button (Ctrl+V). 
When moving or copying hypertext from one cell to another, you can just click 
the cell where the link is to be moved or copied and then press the Enter key.
To move the selected link by using the drag-and-drop method, drag the cell 
or object with the mouse pointer (in the shape of a white arrowhead point-
ing to a black double-cross) and then release the mouse button to drop the 
hypertext or graphic into its new position. To copy the link, be sure to hold 
down the Ctrl key (which changes the pointer to a white arrowhead with a 
plus sign to its right) as you drag the outline of the cell or object.
Hyperlinks 101

Book IV
Chapter 2
Linking Workbooks 
with Hyperlinks
449
 
When attempting to move or copy a cell by using the drag-and-drop method, 
remember that you have to position the thick, white-cross mouse pointer on 
one of the borders of the cell before the pointer changes to a white arrow-
head pointing to a black double-cross. If you position the pointer anywhere 
within the cell’s borders, the mouse changes to the hand with the index 
finger pointing upward, indicating that the hyperlink is active.
Using the HYPERLINK Function
Instead of using the Hyperlink command button on the Insert tab of the 
Ribbon, you can use Excel’s HYPERLINK function to create a hypertext link 
(you can’t use this function to attach a hyperlink to a graphic object). The 
HYPERLINK function uses the following syntax:
HYPERLINK(link_location,[friendly_name])
The link_location argument specifies the name of the document to open on 
your local hard disk, on a network server (designated by a UNC address), or 
on the company’s intranet or the World Wide Web (designated by the URL 
address — see the sidebar, “How to tell a UNC from a URL address and when 
to care,” for details). The optional friendly_name argument is the hyperlink 
text that appears in the cell where you enter the HYPERLINK function. If you 
omit this argument, Excel displays the text specified as the link_location 
argument in the cell.
When specifying the arguments for a HYPERLINK function that you type 
on the Formula bar (as opposed to one that you create by using the Insert 
Function feature by filling in the text boxes in the Function Arguments 
dialog box), you must remember to enclose both the link_location and 
friendly_name arguments in closed double quotes. For example, to enter 
a HYPERLINK function in a cell that takes you to the home page of the For 
Dummies Web site and displays the text, “Dummies Home Page” in the cell, 
enter the following in the cell:
=HYPERLINK(“http://www.dummies.com”,”Dummies Home Page”)
Using the HYPERLINK Function

450
How to tell a UNC from a URL 
address and when to care
The address that you use to specify a remote 
hyperlink destination comes in two basic fla-
vors: UNC (Universal Naming Convention) and 
the more familiar URL (Universal Resource 
Locator). The type of address that you use 
depends on whether the destination file resides 
on a server on a network (in which case, you 
use a UNC address) or on a corporate intranet 
or the Internet (in which case, you use a URL 
address). Note that URLs also appear in many 
flavors, the most popular being those that use 
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and 
begin with http:// and those that use the 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and start with 
ftp://.
The UNC address for destination files on net-
work servers start with two backslash charac-
ters (\\), following this format:
\\server\share\path\filename
In this format, the name of the file server con-
taining the file replaces server, the name of 
the shared folder replaces share, the direc-
tory path specifying any subfolders of the 
shared folder replaces path, and the file’s 
complete filename (including any filename 
extension, such as .xls for Excel worksheet) 
replaces filename.
The URL address for files published on Web 
sites follows this format:
internet service//internet 
address/path/filename
In this format, internet service is 
replaced with the Internet protocol to be 
used (either HTTP or FTP in most cases), 
internet address is replaced with the 
domain name (such as www.dummies.com) 
or the number assigned to the internet server, 
path is the directory path of the file, and 
filename is the complete name (including 
filename extensions such as .htm or .html 
for Web pages).

In This Chapter
✓ Preparing a workbook for distribution
✓ Tracking changes made to a shared workbook
✓ Adding and reviewing comments in a workbook
✓ Adding ink annotations to a workbook on a Tablet PC
✓ Sending a workbook out for review as an e-mail attachment
I
n this day and age of networked personal computers and high-speed 
Internet access, Excel offers you the capability of not only sharing your 
Excel spreadsheets with coworkers and clients, but also tracking and man-
aging your collective editing changes, which in effect, enables you to create 
spreadsheets by committee.
In this chapter, you discover how to check your workbook to prepare it for 
distribution, and then track the changes made to that workbook after you 
share it so that your coworkers can simultaneously edit it. You also find out 
how to merge changes that different workers independently make to the 
contents of the workbook so that you end up with a single updated version 
that you can distribute within the company and outside it.
As part of the review process, you may want to just comment on aspects 
of the spreadsheet and suggest possible changes rather than make these 
changes yourself or even mark up the spreadsheet with digital ink if your 
computer is equipped with a graphics tablet or is a bona fide Tablet PC. 
In this chapter, you find out how to get your two cents in by annotating a 
spreadsheet with text notes that indicate suggested improvements or cor-
rections as well as highlight potential change areas with ink.
Preparing a Workbook for Distribution
The Information panel in the Excel 2010 Backstage view (Alt+FE) enables 
you to prepare your workbook for distribution by checking your workbook. 
To do this, click the Check for Issues button in the Info panel and then 
select any of the following options:

452
 
✦ Inspect Document to open the Document Inspector, which checks your 
documents for hidden content and metadata (data about the document). 
You can delete any such content that you find prior to distributing the 
file by clicking the Remove All buttons.
 
✦ Check Accessibility to have Excel scan the workbook file for information 
that people with disabilities (particularly, some sort of sight impair-
ment) might have difficulty with.
 
✦ Check Compatibility to check a 2007 or 2010 workbook file saved with 
the Excel Workbook (*.xlsx) XML file format option for any loss in fidel-
ity when it’s saved in the older Excel 97-2003 Workbook (*.xls) binary 
file format.
In addition to these three checking options, the Info panel contains a Manage 
Versions button that, when clicked, gives you the following two options for 
recovering or clearing up draft versions of the workbook so that only the 
final version is available for sharing:
 
✦ Recover Draft Versions to enable you to browse all the versions of the 
current workbook that were closed without saving the final changes 
using Excel’s AutoRecover feature (see Book II, Chapter 1 for details)
 
✦ Delete All Draft Versions to enable you to delete various versions of 
the current workbook that were closed without saving the final changes 
using Excel’s AutoRecover feature (see Book II, Chapter 1 for details)
Adding properties to a workbook
You can add information about your workbook document (called metadata) 
in the Info panel in the Backstage view, using the various fields displayed in 
its right column (see Figure 3-1), which you open by selecting File➪Info or 
pressing Alt+FE. You can then use the metadata that you enter into the Title, 
Tags, Categories, and Author fields in the Info panel in all the quick searches 
(Windows 7 and Vista) or file searches (Windows XP) you perform. Doing so 
enables you to quickly locate the file for opening in Excel for further editing 
and printing or distributing to others to review.
When entering more than one piece of data into a particular field such as 
Tags or Categories, separate each piece with a comma. When you’re done 
adding metadata information to the fields, close the Info panel by clicking 
the File menu at the top of the panel or pressing Esc.

Digitally signing a document
Excel 2010 enables you to add digital signatures to the workbook files that 
you send out for review. After checking the spreadsheet and verifying its 
accuracy and readiness for distribution, you can (assuming that you have 
the authority within your company) digitally sign the workbook in one of 
two ways:
 
✦ Add a visible signature line as a graphic object in the workbook that 
contains your name, the date of the signing, your title, and, if you have 
a digital tablet connected to your computer or are using a bona fide 
Tablet PC, your inked handwritten signature.
 
✦ Add an invisible signature to the workbook indicated by the Digital 
Signature icon on the Status bar and metadata added to the document 
that verifies the source of the workbook.
By adding a digital signature, you warrant the following three things about 
the Excel workbook you’re about to distribute:
 
✦ Authenticity: The person who signs the Excel workbook is the person 
he says he is (and not somebody else posing as the signer).
Preparing a Workbook for Distribution

454
 
✦ Integrity: The content of the file has not been modified in any way since 
the workbook was digitally signed.
 
✦ Non-repudiation: The signer stands behind the content of the workbook 
and vouches for its origin.
To make these assurances, the digital signature you add to the workbook 
must be valid in the following ways:
 
✦ The certificate that is associated with the digital signature must be 
issued to the signing publisher by a reputable certificate authority.
 
✦ The certificate must be current and valid.
 
✦ The signing publisher must be deemed trustworthy.
 
Microsoft partners such as secure2trust or IntelliSafe Vault Desktop offer 
digital ID services to which you can subscribe. As reputable certificate author-
ities, their protection services vouch for your trustworthiness as a signing 
publisher and the currency of the certificates associated with your digital sig-
natures. In addition, they enable you to set the permissions for the workbook 
that determine who can open the document and how they can use it.
Adding a digital signature to a workbook
If you want to add a physical signature to your finalized workbook, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Inspect the worksheet data, save all final changes in the workbook 
file, and then position the cell cursor in a blank cell in the vicinity 
where you want the signature line graphic object to appear.
 
 Excel adds the signature line graphic object in the area containing the 
cell cursor. If you don’t move the cell cursor to a blank area, you may 
have to move the signature line graphic so that graphic’s box doesn’t 
obscure existing worksheet data or other graphics or embedded charts.
 
2. Click the Microsoft Office Signature Line option on the Signature Line 
button’s drop-menu on the Ribbon’s Insert tab or press Alt+NG and 
press Enter.
 
 Excel displays an alert dialog box with a rather longwinded spiel about 
digital signatures. This dialog box contains two buttons: Signature 
Services from the Office Marketplace and an OK button. If you want 
to get information about subscribing to a digital ID service, click the 
Signature Services from the Office Marketplace command button. 
Otherwise, proceed to Step 3.

3. Click OK in the alert dialog box — to avoid ever seeing the dialog box 
again, click the Don’t Show This Message Again check box before you 
click OK.
 
 Excel closes the alert dialog box and displays the Signature Setup dialog 
box similar to the one shown in Figure 3-2.
 
4. Type the signer’s name into the Suggested Signer text box and then 
press Tab.
 
5. Type the signer’s title into the Suggested Signer’s Title text box and 
then press Tab.
 
6. Type the signer’s e-mail address into the Suggested Signer’s E-mail 
Address text box.
 
7. (Optional) Click the Allow the Signer to Add Comments in the Sign 
Dialog check box to add a check mark to it if you want to add your 
own comments.
 
8. (Optional) Click the Show Sign Date in Signature Line check box to 
remove its check mark, if you don’t need the date displayed as part of 
the digital signature.
 
9. Click OK to close the Signature Setup dialog box.
 
 Excel adds a signature line graphic object in the vicinity of the cell cursor 
with a big X that contains your name and title (shown in Figure 3-3).
 
10. Double-click this signature line graphic object or right-click the object 
and then click Sign on its shortcut menu.
 
 Excel opens the Sign dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 3-3.
 
11. Add your signature to the list box containing the insertion point.
 
 To add your signature, click the Select Image link on the right, select a 
graphic file that contains a picture of your handwritten signature in the 
Select Signature Image dialog box, and then click Select. If you’re using a 
Tablet PC or your computer has a digital tablet connected to it, you add 
this signature by physically signing your signature with digital ink.
 
 If you selected the Allow the Signer to Add Comments in the Sign Dialog 
check box in Step 7, the Sign dialog box contains a Purpose for Signing 
This Document text box that you fill out in Step 12.
 
12. Click the Purpose for Signing This Document text box and then type in 
the reason for digitally signing the workbook.
 
 By default, Excel issues a digital certificate for the person whose name 
is entered in the Suggested Signer text box back in Step 4. If you want to 
use a certificate issued to someone else in the organization, follow Step 
12. Otherwise, proceed to Step 13.
Preparing a Workbook for Distribution

456
 
13. (Optional) Click the Change command button to open the Select 
Certificate dialog box and then click the name of the person whose 
certificate you want to use in the list box and click OK.
 
 To view the certificate for the person you selected, click the View 
Certificate command button before you click OK. Excel opens the 
Certificate dialog box showing the Certificate information including 
whether the certificate is trusted.
 
14. Click the Sign button to close the Sign dialog box.
 
 Excel displays a Signature Confirmation dialog box indicating that your 
signature has successfully been added to the workbook and warning you 
that the signature becomes invalid if you save any further changes to 
the document.
 
15. Click OK to close the Signature Confirmation dialog box.
Immediately after closing the Signature Confirmation dialog box, Excel adds 
your name to the digital signature graphic object and opens the Signatures 
task pane that displays the signer’s name and date, as shown in Figure 3-4.

To display all the information about the digital signature added to the work-
book, right-click its graphic object and then click Signature Details on its 
shortcut menu. To delete a digital signature from a workbook (which you 
need to do if you discover the sheets in the book require modification), 
right-click the signature graphic and then click Remove Signature on its 
shortcut menu and OK in its confirmation alert dialog box.
 
In place of a signature line, you can add a digital stamp (traditionally, in 
Asian countries such as China, Japan, and Korea, authorities sign a docu-
ment not with a written signature but by affixing their official stamp to the 
document, usually in red ink). To literally add your stamp of approval, rather 
than your signature, to a workbook, click the Stamp Signature Line option on 
the Signature Line button’s drop-down menu on the Insert tab of the Ribbon. 
You then follow steps very similar to those previously outlined for adding a 
digital signature line, except that you must select a graphic file that contains 
the image you want stamped in the workbook in lieu of your signature.
Obtaining a Digital ID for signing a workbook
A digital ID, also known as a digital certificate, is necessary to digitally sign 
the documents you send out for review. If you try to digitally sign a docu-
ment using one of the methods outlined in the previous section and you 
Preparing a Workbook for Distribution

458
don’t have a digital ID, when you try to open the Sign dialog box to sign the 
document or select a stamp, the program displays the Get a Digital ID dialog 
box. In this dialog box, you can choose between the following options:
 
✦ Purchasing a certificate from a trusted third-party vendor by clicking the 
Get a Digital ID from a Microsoft Partner option button
 
✦ Creating your own certificate by clicking the Create Your Own Digital ID 
option button prior to clicking OK
 
If you select the Create Your Own Digital ID option, the people to whom you 
send the workbook file on any other network computer or any computer out-
side of the company won’t be able to verify the authenticity of your digital 
signature or stamp. Therefore, always select the Get a Digital ID from a 
Microsoft Partner option when the security concerns regarding the work-
book’s source and contents require this kind of third-party verification.
When you click the Get a Digital ID from a Microsoft Partner option button 
before you click OK in the Get a Digital ID dialog box (or you click the Add 
Signature Services option on the Signature Line button’s drop-down menu 
on the Insert tab or press Alt+NGA), Excel launches your Web browser that 
opens a Microsoft Office Online Office Marketplace Web page with links 
to trusted third-party vendors of digital certificates. You can then explore 
these links and use them to sign up for digital certificates to use in digitally 
signing your workbook files.
When you click the Create Your Own Digital ID option button before clicking 
OK in the Get a Digital ID dialog box, Excel opens a Create a Digital ID dialog 
box, where you enter the following information in the four text boxes:
 
✦ Name: By default, this text box contains the name of the suggested 
signer of this workbook. Edit the name in this box only when you’re cre-
ating a certificate for another person in the organization.
 
✦ E-mail Address: Enter the e-mail address of the person whose name is 
listed as the signer of the certificate in this text box.
 
✦ Organization: By default, this text box contains the name of the com-
pany to whom the computer is registered. Edit the text in this box only 
when you’re creating a certificate for another organization.
 
✦ Location: Enter your physical location or the name or ID of your per-
sonal computer in this text box.
After you enter all the information in these four text boxes in the Create a 
Digital ID dialog box and click the Create button, Excel opens the Sign dialog 
box where you enter or select your signature or stamp.

the spreadsheets that you create with others who have network access. 
Workbook sharing is perfect for spreadsheets that require frequent or 
regular data updates, especially for those whose data comes from several 
different departments, such as spreadsheets that track budgets or schedule 
projects that rely on input from many departments.
By sharing a workbook, you enable several people to edit its contents at the 
same time. Most often, you facilitate this process by saving the workbook 
file in a folder or network drive to which everyone who needs to edit the 
spreadsheet has access.
You can share an Excel workbook on a network in one of two ways:
 
✦ Set up file sharing for the workbook by clicking the Share Workbook 
command button on the Ribbon’s Review tab (Alt+RW).
 
✦ Turn on change tracking for the workbook by clicking the Highlight 
Changes option on the Track Changes command button’s drop-down 
menu on the Ribbon’s Review tab (Alt+RGH).
Whenever you share a workbook using either of these two methods, Excel 
automatically saves your workbook under the same filename with the shared 
information. The program then indicates that the workbook can now be 
shared by appending [Shared] to the workbook’s filename as it appears on 
the title bar of the Excel program window. When a second person on another 
computer on the network opens the shared workbook file, Excel opens a 
copy of the workbook file and the [Shared] indicator also appears on the 
title bar of his or her Excel program window appended to its filename.
This is in stark contrast to what happens when you try to open an unshared 
workbook on your computer that’s already open on another computer on 
the network. In that case, Excel displays a File in Use alert dialog box inform-
ing you that the workbook you want to open is already open. You can then 
choose between clicking the Read Only button to open the file in read-only 
mode (in which you can’t save your changes under the original filename) 
and clicking the Notify button to have the program open the file in read-only 
mode and then notify you when the other person closes the workbook so 
you can save your changes.
If you click the Notify button, as soon as the other person who was editing 
the workbook closes the file, Excel then displays a File Now Available alert 
dialog box, letting you know that the file is now available to save your edit-
ing. You then click its Read-Write button to close this alert dialog box, and 
after that, you’re free to save your editing changes to the original filename 
with the Save command (Ctrl+S).

Note that you don’t have to be running Excel 2010 on your computer in 
order to open and edit a shared workbook. Workbook sharing is supported 
by the earlier versions of Excel (2007 and 97 through 2003). You can’t, how-
ever, save changes to a shared workbook if you’re using a version earlier 
than Excel 2007.
Also note that when you make changes to a shared workbook, Excel uses 
your user name to identify the modifications that you made. To modify your 
user name, you edit the contents of the User Name text box on the Popular 
tab of the Excel Options dialog box (File➪ Options or Alt+FI).
When you share a workbook, Excel disables some of the program’s editing 
features so they can’t be used in editing the shared spreadsheet. The follow-
ing tasks are not enabled in a shared workbook:
 
✦ Deleting worksheets from the workbook
 
✦ Merging cells in the worksheets of a workbook
 
✦ Applying conditional formats to the cells of the worksheets (although all 
conditional formats in effect before you share the workbook remain in 
effect)
 
✦ Setting up or applying data validation to cells of the worksheets 
(although all data validation restrictions and messages remain in effect 
in the shared workbook)
 
✦ Inserting or deleting blocks of cells in a worksheet (although you can 
insert or delete entire columns and rows from the sheet)
 
✦ Drawing shapes and adding text boxes (see Book V, Chapter 2, for 
details)
 
✦ Assigning passwords for protecting individual worksheets or the entire 
workbook (although all protection and passwords defined prior to shar-
ing the workbook remain in effect — see Book IV, Chapter 1, for details 
on protecting worksheets)
 
✦ Grouping or outlining data in a worksheet (see Book II, Chapter 4, for 
details)
 
✦ Inserting automatic subtotals in a worksheet (see Book VI, Chapter 1, for 
details)
 
✦ Creating data tables or pivot tables in a worksheet (see Book VII, 
Chapters 1 and 2, for details)
 
✦ Creating, revising, or assigning macros (although you can run macros 
that were created in the worksheet before it was shared, provided that 
they don’t perform any operations that aren’t supported by a shared 
workbook — see Book VIII, Chapter 1, for details)

Turning on file sharing
The first way to share a workbook is by turning on file sharing as follows:
 
1. Open the workbook to be shared and then make any last-minute 
edits to the file, especially those that are not supported in a shared 
workbook.
 
 Keep in mind when making these last-minute changes that when you 
share a workbook, some of Excel’s editing features become unavailable 
to you and any others working in the file. (Refer to the list in the previ-
ous section for exactly which features are unavailable.)
 
 Before turning on file sharing, you may want to save the workbook in a 
special folder on a network drive to which everyone who is to edit the 
file has access.
 
2. Click File➪Save As or press Alt+FA and then select the network drive 
and the folder in the Save As dialog box in which you want to the 
make the shared version of this file available before you click the 
Save button.
 
3. Click the Share Workbook command button on the Review tab of the 
Ribbon or press Alt+RW.
 
 Excel opens a Share Workbook dialog box (similar to the one shown 
in Figure 3-5). This dialog box contains two tabs: an Editing tab that 
enables you to turn on file sharing for all the users who have the file 
open, and an Advanced tab, where you control how the amount of time 
that changes is tracked and how updates are handled.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Turning on 
file sharing 
on the 
Editing tab 
of the Share 
Workbook 
dialog box.
 
 
4. Click the Allow Changes by More Than One User at the Same Time 
check box on the Editing tab.
 
 By default, Excel maintains a Change History log for 30 days. If you wish, 
you can use the Advanced tab settings to modify whether Excel main-
tains this Change History log (necessary if you want to reconcile and 
Workbook Sharing 101

462
merge changes) or to change how long the program saves this log. You 
can also change when changes are updated, how conflicts are handled, 
and whether your print settings and data filtering settings are shared.
 
5. (Optional) Click the Advanced tab and then change the options on this 
tab that affect how long a change log is maintained and how editing 
conflicts are handled.
 
 See the following section, “Modifying the Workbook Share options,” for 
details on changing these settings.
 
6. Click the OK button to close the Share Workbook dialog box.
 
 As soon as Excel closes the Share Workbook dialog box, an alert dialog 
box appears, telling you that Excel will now save the workbook and 
asking you if you want to continue.
 
7. Click the OK button in the Microsoft Excel alert dialog box to save the 
workbook with the file sharing settings.
Immediately after you click OK and close the alert dialog box, Excel saves 
the workbook and the [Shared] indicator appears at the end of the filename 
on the Excel program window’s title bar.
Modifying the Workbook Share options
As soon as you turn on file sharing for a workbook, Excel also turns on a 
Change History log that records all the changes made by different individu-
als to the same workbook file. You can use the Change History log to view 
information about the various changes made to a shared workbook and to 
determine which of the changes to retain if conflicting changes are made 
by different people to the same cells of a workbook. You can also use the 
Change History log when merging changes from different copies of the same 
workbook into a single file.
By default, Excel maintains the Change History log for a period of 30 days 
from the date that you first share the workbook. If you wish, you can change 
the length of time that Excel maintains the Change History log or, even, in 
rare circumstances, elect to not keep the log.
To make changes to the length of time that Excel maintains the Change 
History log, you click the Advanced tab in the Share Workbook dialog box 
(Alt+RW), as shown in Figure 3-6. This tab contains the following sections 
with options for not only changing how long the Change History log is main-
tained, but also controlling when and how updates are handled:
 
✦ Track Changes: Enables you to modify how long Excel keeps the Change 
History log by entering a new value in the Keep Change History For text 
box or selecting a new value with the spinner buttons. Click the Don’t 
Keep Change History option button should you ever decide that you 
don’t need the Change History log.

✦ Update Changes: Enables you to select when changes made by differ-
ent users are saved. By default, Excel saves changes when the file is 
saved. To have the program save changes every so many minutes, click 
the Automatically Every option button and then enter the number of 
minutes for the save interval in the Minutes text box or select this inter-
val value with its spinner buttons. When automatically saving changes 
every so many minutes, by default, Excel saves only your changes while 
showing you changes made to the workbook by others. To have the pro-
gram just display the changes made to the file by others when the save 
interval is reached without saving your changes, click the Just See Other 
Users’ Changes option button.
 
✦ Conflicting Changes Between Users: Enables you to select how changes 
made to the same cells of a shared workbook by different users are 
treated. By default, Excel is set to ask you which user’s changes to 
accept and which to deny. If you want Excel to accept the changes made 
by any user at the time she saves the workbook, click the Changes Being 
Saved Win option button.
 
✦ Include in Personal View: Enables you to determine which of your 
personal settings are saved when you save the workbook. By default, 
Excel saves both your personal print settings (including such things 
as page breaks, changes to the print area, and changes to the printing 
settings — see Book II, Chapter 5, for details) and the filtering settings 
you select with the AutoFilter buttons (see Book VI, Chapter 2, for 
details). Deselect the Print Settings and/or Filter Settings check boxes 
at the bottom of the Advanced tab if you decide that you don’t need 
these settings saved as part of the shared workbook.

Turning on Change tracking
The second way to share a workbook on a network is by turning on change 
tracking. When you do this, Excel tracks all changes you make to the con-
tents of the cells in the shared workbook by highlighting their cells and 
Workbook Sharing 101

464
adding comments that summarize the type of change you make. When you 
turn on change tracking, Excel automatically turns on file sharing along with 
the workbook’s Change History log.
To turn on change tracking in a workbook, you take these steps:
 
1. Open the workbook for which you want to track changes and that you 
wish to share, and then make any last-minute edits to the file, espe-
cially those that are not supported in a shared workbook.
 
 When making these last-minute changes, keep in mind that, when you 
share a workbook, some of Excel’s editing features become unavail-
able to you and any others working in the file. (Refer to the “Workbook 
Sharing 101” section, earlier in this chapter, for a list of exactly which 
features are unavailable.)
 
 Before turning on file sharing, you may want to save the workbook in a 
special folder on a network drive to which everyone who is to edit the 
file has access.
 
2. Click File➪Save As or press Alt+FA and then select the network drive 
and the folder in the Save As dialog box in which you want to the 
make the change tracking version of this file available before you 
click Save.
 
3. Click the Highlight Changes option on the Track Changes command 
button’s drop-down menu on the Review tab or press Alt+RGH.
 
 Doing this opens the Highlight Changes dialog box, shown in Figure 3-7, 
where you turn on change tracking and indicate which changes to highlight.
 
Figure 3-7: 
Turning 
on change 
tracking in 
the Highlight 
Changes 
dialog box.
 
 
4. Click the Track Changes While Editing check box.
 
 Doing this turns on change tracking and automatically turns on file shar-
ing for the workbook.
 
 By default, Excel selects the When combo box and chooses the All 
option from its drop-down menu to have all changes made to the work-
book tracked. To track the changes only from the time you last saved 
the workbook, click the Since I Last Saved item on the When drop-down 
Workbook Sharing 101

465
menu. To track all changes that you’ve not yet reviewed (and decided 
whether to accept), you click the Not Yet Reviewed item on the When 
drop-down menu. (Most often, you want this option so that you can 
use the Accept/Reject Changes option on the Track Changes command 
button’s drop-down menu to review each person’s changes and decide 
whether to keep them.) To track changes from a particular date, click 
Since Date on the When drop-down menu: Excel then inserts the current 
date into the When combo box, which you can then edit, if necessary.
 
5. (Optional) If you don’t want to track all changes in the workbook, click 
the When drop-down button and then click the menu item on its drop-
down menu (Since I Last Saved, Not Yet Reviewed, or Since Date).
 
 By default, Excel tracks the changes made by anybody who opens and 
edits the workbook (including you). If you want to exempt yourself from 
change tracking or restrict it to a particular user, click the Who check 
box and then click Everyone But Me or the user’s name on the Who 
drop-down menu.
 
6. (Optional) If you want to restrict change tracking, click the name of 
the person to whom you want to restrict change tracking in the Who 
drop-down list.
 
 Note that selecting any option on the Who drop-down menu automati-
cally selects the Who check box by putting a check mark in it.
 
 By default, changes made to any and all cells in every sheet in the work-
book are tracked. To restrict the change tracking to a particular range 
or nonadjacent cell selection, click the Where check box and then select 
the cells.
 
7. (Optional) If you want to restrict change tracking to a particular cell 
range or cell selection in the workbook, click the Where combo box and 
then select the cell range or nonadjacent cell selection in the workbook.
 
 Clicking the Where text box and selecting a cell range in the workbook 
automatically selects the Where check box by putting a check mark in it.
 
 By default, Excel highlights all editing changes in the cells of the work-
sheet on the screen by selecting the Highlight Changes on Screen check 
box. If you don’t want the changes marked in the cells, you need to dese-
lect this check box.
 
8. (Optional) If you don’t want changes displayed in the cells on-screen, 
click the Highlight Changes on Screen check box to remove its check 
mark.
 
 Note that after you finish saving the workbook as a shared file, you 
can return to the Highlight Changes dialog box and then select its List 
Changes on a New Sheet check box to have all your changes listed on 
a new worksheet added to the workbook. Note too, that if you select 
this check box when the Highlight Changes on Screen check box is 
selected, Excel both marks the changes in their cells and lists them 
Workbook Sharing 101

466
on a new sheet. If you deselect the Highlight Changes on Screen check 
box while the List Changes on a New Sheet check box is selected, Excel 
just lists the changes on a new worksheet without marking them in the 
cells of the worksheet.
 
9. Click the OK button to close the Highlight Changes dialog box.
 
 As soon as Excel closes the Highlight Changes dialog box, an alert dialog 
box appears, telling you that Excel will now save the workbook and 
asking you if you want to continue.
 
10. Click the OK button in the Microsoft Excel alert dialog box to save the 
workbook with the change tracking and file sharing settings.
After you turn on change tracking in a shared workbook, Excel highlights the 
following changes:
 
✦ Changes to the cell contents, including moving and copying the contents 
to new cells in the worksheet
 
✦ Deletion of the cell contents
 
✦ Insertion of new rows, columns, or cells in a worksheet
When Change tracking is turned on in a workbook, the program does not, 
however, highlight any of these changes:
 
✦ Formatting changes made to the cells
 
✦ Hidden or unhidden rows and columns in the worksheet
 
✦ Renamed sheet tabs in the workbook
 
✦ Insertion or deletion of a worksheet in the workbook
 
✦ Comments added to the cells
 
✦ Changes to cell values resulting from the recalculation of formulas or to 
cells whose values depend upon those formulas
In highlighting changes you make to the shared workbook, Excel draws a 
thin line (in another color — usually blue) around the borders of the cell, 
while at the same time placing a triangle of the same color in the cell’s 
upper-left corner. When you position the thick white-cross mouse pointer on 
a highlighted cell, Excel displays a comment indicating the change made to 
the cell along with the date and time it was made and who made it, as shown 
in Figure 3-8.
 
When you turn on change tracking, you also necessarily turn on file shar-
ing, and when file sharing is in effect, you can’t make certain kinds of edit-
ing changes. For a complete list of these changes, refer back to the section, 
“Workbook Sharing 101,” earlier in this chapter.

Merging changes from different users
At some point after sharing a workbook, you’ll want to update the work-
book to incorporate the changes made by different users. When merging 
changes, you may also have to deal with conflicting changes made to the 
same cells and decide which changes to accept and which to reject. After 
you’ve merged all the input and decided how to deal with all the conflicting 
changes, you may even want to turn off file sharing to prevent users from 
doing any further editing.
Resolving conflicts
When you turn on file sharing for a workbook, Excel automatically updates 
the changes made to the shared workbook whenever anybody who’s edit-
ing the file saves his changes. Should the program identify cells in the 
workbook that contain conflicting changes (that is, different values placed 
in the same cell by different users), it flags the cell in the workbook and 
then displays the conflict in the Resolve Conflicts dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 3-9. To accept your change to the cell in question, you click the 
Accept Mine button. To accept the change made by another user, you click 
the Accept Other button instead.
Workbook Sharing 101

468
After you accept your change or the other user’s change in the case of the 
first conflict, Excel flags the next case and displays a description of the con-
flicting values in the Resolve Conflicts dialog box. When you finish accepting 
or rejecting your change or the one made by another user for the last con-
flicting value, Excel automatically closes the Resolve Conflicts dialog box, 
and you can save your changes to the workbook by clicking File➪Save or by 
pressing Ctrl+S.
If you want Excel to accept only your changes in all cases of conflicting 
values, click the Accept All Mine button. To have Excel reject all your 
changes and accept all those made by others, click the Accept All Others 
button instead.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Deciding 
which 
change to 
accept in 
the Resolve 
Conflicts 
dialog box.
 
 
If you know that you always want all your changes to be accepted in the case 
of conflicting values, open the Share Workbook dialog box (Alt+RW) and 
then click the Changes Being Saved Win option button on the Advanced tab 
before you click OK. If you prefer to have your changes (including conflict-
ing ones) automatically saved at set intervals, click the Automatically option 
button and set the number of minutes between saves in the Minutes text box 
before you click OK.
Accepting or rejecting highlighted changes
When you turn on change tracking for a workbook, you can decide which 
changes to accept or reject by clicking the Accept/Reject Changes option 
on the Track Changes command button’s drop-down menu on the Ribbon’s 
Review tab (or pressing Alt+RGC). When you do this, Excel reviews all the 
highlighted changes made by you and others who’ve worked on the shared 
file, enabling you to accept or reject individual changes.
When you first choose the Accept/Reject Changes option, Excel displays the 
alert dialog box, informing you that Excel will save the workbook. When you 
click OK to close this alert dialog box, the program opens the Select Changes 
to Accept or Reject dialog box, which contains the same three check boxes 
and associated drop-down items (When, Who, and Where) as the Highlight 
Changes dialog box shown in Figure 3-8.
Workbook Sharing 101

469
By default, the When check box is selected along with the Not Yet Reviewed 
setting in the Select Changes to Accept or Reject dialog box. When this set-
ting is selected, Excel displays all the changes in the workbook that you 
haven’t yet reviewed for everyone who has modified the shared file. To 
review only those changes you made on the current date, click the Since 
Date item on the When drop-down list. To review changes made since a par-
ticular date, edit the current date in the Since Date drop-down list.
To review only changes that other people have made, only those changes 
you’ve made, or only those changes a particular coworker has made, click 
the appropriate item (Everyone But Me, your name, or another user’s name) 
on the Who drop-down list. If you want to restrict the review to a particular 
range or region of a worksheet, click the Where combo box and then select 
the range or nonadjacent cell ranges with the cells to review.
After you select which changes to review in the Select Changes to Accept 
or Reject dialog box, click the OK button. Excel then closes this dialog 
box, highlights the cell in the worksheet that contains the first change to 
review, and opens the Accept or Reject Changes dialog box (similar to the 
one shown in Figure 3-10), where you indicate whether to accept or reject 
the change. To accept the change, you click the Accept button. To reject 
the change and keep the original value, you click the Reject button instead. 
Excel then highlights the next cell in the worksheet that needs reviewing, 
while at the same time displaying a description of the change in the Accept 
or Reject Changes dialog box.

If you know ahead of time that you want to accept or reject all the changes 
that have been made since you last reviewed the workbook or the date you 
specified, click the Accept All button or the Reject All button, respectively. 
When you accept or reject the last change identified in the workbook, the 
Accept or Reject Changes dialog box automatically closes, and you can then 
save the workbook (Ctrl+S) with the editing changes made as a result of this 
review.

How to stop sharing a workbook
If you decide that you no longer want to share a particular workbook, you 
can turn off the file sharing. To do this, open the Share Workbook dialog box 
(Alt+RW) and remove the check mark from the Allow Changes by More Than 
One User at the Same Time check box on the Editing tab before you click OK.
As soon as you click OK, Excel displays an Information alert dialog box indicat-
ing that your action is about to remove the workbook from shared use and, at 
the same time, erase the Change History log. It also informs you that users who 
are currently editing this workbook will be unable to save their changes even if 
you should later change your mind and turn the file sharing back on again.
 
Because users are prevented from saving their changes and the Change 
History log is erased as soon as you turn off file sharing and make the work-
book once again exclusive, you don’t ever want to turn off file sharing until 
after you’re sure that you have everybody’s comments and changes saved to 
the workbook and have reviewed and merged the changes you want to keep.
If you’re sure that you’ve met these two conditions, you can click the Yes 
button in the Information alert dialog box to turn off file sharing and once 
again make the workbook your exclusive property. Click the No button, how-
ever, to abort this procedure if you have any doubt about having all your 
users’ changes erased.
 
It’s always a good idea to inform the users of your shared workbook of your 
intention to remove the file from shared use well in advance of the actual 
date. Your best bet is to e-mail each user and let him or her know exactly the 
date and time after which the workbook will no longer be shared and open 
to their edits. That way, each person on the team knows the exact time after 
which his or her changes and comments will no longer be accepted (which 
is often a good inducement for the procrastinators on the team to send you 
their last-minute suggestions and changes).
Removing a user from the shared workbook
Sometimes, rather than preventing everyone from sharing a particular work-
book, you may only need to stop particular users from being able to edit it. 
To remove a specific user from sharing in the editing, you open the Share 
Workbook dialog box (Alt+RW), click the name of the person you want to 
remove in the Who Has the Workbook Open Now list box, and then click the 
Remove User button.
As soon as you click this button, Excel displays an alert dialog box informing 
you that if the user you selected is currently editing the workbook, your action 
will prevent him or her from saving the workbook so that all unsaved work is 
automatically lost. To proceed with removing the user, click the OK button in 
this alert dialog box. To abandon the removal until after you’ve verified that 
the user isn’t currently editing the file, click the Cancel button instead.

Workbooks on Review
Even if you don’t use Excel on a network, you still can add your comments 
to the cells of a workbook that ask for clarification or suggest changes, and 
then distribute copies of the workbook by e-mail to other people who need 
to review and, perhaps, respond to your remarks. Excel makes it easy to 
annotate the cells of a worksheet, and the command buttons on the Review 
tab of the Ribbon make it easy to review these notes prior to e-mailing the 
workbook to others who have to review the comments, and even reply to 
suggested changes.
And if you’re running Excel 2010 on a computer equipped with a digital 
tablet or on a bona fide Tablet PC, the Review tab of your Ribbon has a Start 
Inking command button (not included on this tab when running Excel on a 
regular PC). When you click the Start Inking command button, Excel adds 
an Ink Tools contextual tab to the Ribbon. You can then use the command 
buttons on its Pens tab to highlight and mark up various parts of the spread-
sheet with digital ink.
Adding comments
You can add comments to the current cell by clicking the New Comment 
command button on the Ribbon’s Review tab or by pressing Alt+RC. Excel 
responds by adding a comment box (similar to the one shown in Figure 3-11) 
with your name listed at the top (or the name of the person who shows up 
in the User Name text box on the Personalize tab of the Excel Options dialog 
box). You can then type the text of your comment in this box. When you 
finish typing the text of the note, click the cell to which you’re attaching the 
note or any other cell in the worksheet to close the Comment box.
Displaying and hiding comments
Excel indicates that you’ve attached a comment to a worksheet cell by 
adding a red triangle to the cell’s upper-right corner. To display the com-
ment box with its text, you position the thick, white-cross mouse pointer on 
this red triangle, or you can click the Show All Comments command button 
on the Review tab (Alt+RA) to display all comments in the worksheet.
When you display a comment by positioning the mouse pointer on the cell’s 
red triangle, the comment disappears as soon as you move the pointer out-
side the cell. When you display all the comments on the worksheet by click-
ing the Show All Comments command button on the Review tab, you must 
click the Show All Comments button a second time before Excel closes their 
comment boxes (or press Alt+RA).
Workbooks on Review

Figure 3-11: 
Adding

to various 
cells of a 
worksheet.
 
Editing and formatting comments
When you first add a comment to a cell, its Comment box appears to the right 
of the cell with an arrow pointing to the red triangle in the cell’s upper-right 
corner. If you need to, you can reposition a cell’s Comment box and/or resize 
it so that it doesn’t obscure certain cells in the immediate region. You can also 
edit the text of a comment and change the formatting of the text font.
To reposition or resize a Comment box or edit the note text or its font, you 
make the cell current by putting the cell cursor in it, and then click the Edit 
Comment command button, which replaces the New Comment button as 
the first button in the Comments group on the Review tab of the Ribbon, or 
press Alt+RT. (You can also do this by right-clicking the cell and then click-
ing Edit Comment on the cell’s shortcut menu.)
Whichever method you use, Excel then displays the cell’s comment box and 
positions the insertion point at the end of the comment text. To reposition 
the comment box, position the mouse pointer on the edge of the box (indi-
cated with cross-hatching and open circles around the perimeter). When the 
mouse pointer assumes the shape of a white arrowhead pointing to a black 
double-cross, you can then drag the outline of the comment box to a new 
position in the worksheet. After you release the mouse button, Excel draws a 
new line ending in an arrowhead from the repositioned Comment box to the 
red triangle in the cell’s upper-right corner.

When editing and formatting the comments you’ve added to the worksheet, 
you can do any of the following:
 
✦ To resize the comment box, you position the mouse pointer on one of 
the open circles at the corners or in the middle of each edge on the 
box’s perimeter. When the mouse pointer changes into a double-headed 
arrow, you drag the handle of the Comment box until its dotted outline 
is the size and shape you want. (Excel automatically reflows the com-
ment text to suit the new size and shape of the box.)
 
✦ To edit the text of the comment (when the insertion point is positioned 
somewhere in it), drag the I-beam mouse pointer through text that needs 
to be replaced or press the Backspace key (to remove characters to the 
left of the insertion point) or Delete key (to remove characters to the 
right). You can insert new characters in the comment to the right of the 
insertion point by simply typing them.
 
✦ To change the formatting of the comment text, select the text by drag-
ging the I-beam mouse pointer through it, then click the appropriate 
command button in the Font and Alignment groups on the Home tab 
of the Ribbon. (You can use Live Preview to see how a new font or font 
size, on its respective drop-down menu, looks in the comment, pro-
vided that these drop-down menus don’t cover the comment box in the 
worksheet.)
 
You can also right-click the text and click Format Comment on the shortcut 
menu. Doing this opens the Format Comment dialog box (with the same 
options as the Font tab of the Format Cells dialog box) where you can 
change the font, font style, font size, font color, or add special effects includ-
ing underlining, strikethrough, as well as super- and subscripting.
When you finish making your changes to the comment box and text, close the 
comment box by clicking its cell or any of the other cells in the worksheet.
Deleting comments
When you no longer need a comment, you can delete it by selecting its cell 
before you do any of the following:
 
✦ Click the Comments option on the Clear button’s drop-down menu on 
the Home tab of the Ribbon or press Alt+HEM.
 
✦ Click the Delete command button in the Comments group on the Review 
tab of the Ribbon or press Alt+RD.
 
✦ Right-click the cell and then click Delete Comment on its shortcut menu.

If you delete a comment in error, you can restore it to its cell by clicking the 
Undo command button on the Quick Access toolbar or pressing Ctrl+Z.
Marking up a worksheet with digital ink
If you’re fortunate enough to have a digital tablet connected to your computer 
or to be running Excel 2010 on a Tablet PC computer, you can mark up your 
worksheets with digital ink. Excel 2010 equipped with a digital tablet or run-
ning on a Tablet PC contains a Start Inking command button located at the 
very end of the Ribbon’s Review tab. When you click this command button (or 
press Alt+RK), Excel displays a Pens tab on the Ink Tools contextual tab.
By default, Excel chooses the felt tip pen as the pen type for annotating the 
worksheet with digital ink. If you’d prefer to use a ballpoint pen or high-
lighter in marking up the worksheet, click the Ballpoint Pen command button 
or Highlighter command button in the Pens group.
When using the highlighter or either of the two pen types (felt tip or ball-
point pen), you can select a new line weight for the ink by clicking the point 
size (running from 3/4 all the way up to 6 points) on the Weight command 
button’s drop-down menu. You can also select a new ink color (yellow being 
the default color for the highlighter, red for the felt tip pen, and black for 
ballpoint pen) by clicking its color swatch on the Color command button’s 
drop-down palette.
After you select the pen type, color, and line weight, you can use the physical 
pen that comes with your Tablet PC to mark up the spreadsheet as follows:
 
✦ To highlight data in the spreadsheet with the highlighter, drag the high-
light mouse pointer through the cells (just as though you had an actual 
yellow highlighter in your hand).
 
✦ To circle data in the spreadsheet with the felt tip pen, drag the pen tip 
mouse pointer around the cells in the worksheet.
 
✦ To add a comment with the ballpoint pen, drag the pen tip mouse 
pointer to write out your text in the worksheet.
 
If you make a mistake with ink, you need to remove it and start over again. 
To delete the ink, click the Eraser command button in the Pens group and 
then click somewhere on the highlighting, drawing, or handwriting you 
want to erase with the eraser mouse pointer (sometimes you have to drag 
through the ink to completely remove it). Then, reselect the highlighter or 
felt tip or ballpoint pen and reapply your ink annotation.

When you finish marking up the worksheet with ink, click the Close Ink Tools 
command button on the Pens tab of the Ink Tools contextual tab. Excel then 
closes the Ink Tools contextual tab, once again displaying only the normal 
Ribbon tabs.
Sending a workbook as an e-mail attachment
Excel makes it easy to send out workbooks that you’ve annotated for review 
to clients, coworkers, and managers. You can send the workbook as a simple 
attachment to an e-mail message by clicking the File menu, highlighting the 
Save & Send option, and then clicking the Send Using Email option on its 
submenu followed by Send as Attachment (or pressing Alt+FHEA).
When you do this, Excel opens your e-mail program (such as Windows Mail, 
Outlook, or Outlook Express) and starts a new e-mail message. In the mes-
sage, Excel automatically fills in the Subject line with the name of the active 
workbook and attaches a copy of the file to the new message. You can fill in 
the recipient’s e-mail address in the To text box, type in the body of the mes-
sage, and then click the Send button to send the message off to your recipi-
ent or recipients.
When the e-mail recipients open the e-mail message with an attached work-
book file, they can save the file to disk and then open it as they would any 
other Excel workbook.
 
To save a workbook attached to an e-mail message, right-click the filename 
of the attached workbook that appears on the message’s header and then 
click Save As on the shortcut menu. If you want to open the workbook 
directly in Excel, click Open on the attachment’s shortcut menu instead. 
If your e-mail program is Windows Live Mail, Outlook, or Outlook Express, 
you may receive an Opening Mail Attachment alert dialog box warning that 
the file may contain potentially damaging viruses and suggesting that you 
first save the workbook to disk. If you’re sure of the source of the e-mail and 
aren’t worried about a virus, click the Open It option button in this alert 
dialog box and then click OK.

✓ Getting Excel data and charts into a Word document
✓ Getting Excel data and charts into the slides of a PowerPoint 
presentation
✓ Exporting your Outlook Contacts into an Excel worksheet
✓ Using Smart Tags to share online information

S
haring data between Excel and other Windows programs that you use 
is the topic of this chapter. In many cases, data sharing involves getting 
Excel data tables, data lists, and charts into other Office programs that you 
use, especially Microsoft Word documents and PowerPoint presentations. In 
other cases, data sharing involves getting data generated in other programs, 
such as in tables and lists created in Microsoft Word and contacts main-
tained in Microsoft Outlook, into an Excel worksheet.
In addition to data sharing that involves bringing data stored in different 
types of documents into Excel worksheets, the program continues to 
support data sharing in the form of Smart Tags that can bring information 
into the spreadsheet that’s related to a particular type of data entry, such 
as a person’s name, a company’s stock symbol, or the name of a city. 
Information imported through the use of Smart Tags can come from local 
sources, such as your Outlook Contacts file, as well as from online sources, 
such as MSN MoneyCentral on the Web.

478
Also, you can share worksheet data by publishing the Excel workbook in 
a shared space such as a document workspace or document management 
server where users can access the data by opening up the workbook file in 
their own copies of Excel. Finally, you can give people access to worksheet 
data using programs other than Excel, including Acrobat Reader, the XML 
Paper Specification Viewer, and their own Web browsers by saving the 
workbook in a special PDF, XPS, or HTML file format or by publishing the 
workbook to a SharePoint server running Excel Services or to your Windows 
Live, where you can edit its worksheets online using the brand new Excel 
Web app.
Office 2010 Data Sharing Basics
You share information between Excel and other Windows programs in two 
ways: You either copy or move discrete objects or blocks of data from one 
program’s file to another, or you open an entire file created with one pro-
gram in the other program.
The key to sharing blocks of data or discrete objects in Excel is the Windows 
Clipboard. Remember that Excel always gives you access to contents of 
the Clipboard in the form of the Clipboard task pane, which you can open 
by clicking the Dialog Box Launcher button in the lower-right corner of the 
Clipboard group at the beginning of the Home tab on the Ribbon. When the 
Clipboard task pane is open, you can then copy its objects or blocks of text 
into cells of the open worksheet simply by clicking the item in this task pane.
Because very few people purchase Excel 2010 as a separate program outside 
the Microsoft Office 2010 suite, it should be no surprise that most of the 
file sharing happens between Excel and one of the other major applications 
included in Microsoft Office (such as Word, PowerPoint, and Access).
However, before you rush off and start wildly throwing Excel 2010 work-
sheets into Word 2010 documents and Excel 2010 charts into PowerPoint 
2010 presentations, you need to realize that Microsoft offers you a choice 
in the way that you exchange data between your various Office programs. 
You can either embed the worksheet or chart in the other program or set 
up a link between the Excel-generated object in the other program and Excel 
itself.
 
✦ Embedding means that the Excel object (whether it’s a worksheet or 
a chart) actually becomes part of the Word document or PowerPoint 
presentation. Any changes that you then need to make to the worksheet 
or chart must be made within the Word document or PowerPoint pre-
sentation. This presupposes, however, that you have Excel on the same 
computer as Word or PowerPoint and that your computer has enough 
memory to run them both.
Office 2010 Data Sharing Basics

Book IV
Chapter 4
Sharing Worksheets 
and Worksheet Data
479
 
✦ Linking means that the Excel object (worksheet or chart) is only referred 
to in the Word document or PowerPoint presentation. Any changes that 
you make to the worksheet or chart must be made in Excel itself and 
then updated when you open the Word document or PowerPoint presen-
tation to which it is linked.
Use the embedding method when the Excel object (worksheet or chart) is 
not apt to change very often, if at all. Use the linking method when the Excel 
object (worksheet or chart) changes fairly often, when you always need the 
latest and greatest version of the object to appear in your Word document 
or PowerPoint presentation, or when you don’t want to make the Word or 
PowerPoint document any bigger by adding the Excel data to it.
 
Be aware that when you link an Excel worksheet or chart to another Office 
document and you want to show that document or print it on a different 
computer, you must copy both the Excel workbook with the linked work-
sheet/chart and the Word or PowerPoint file to that computer. Also be 
aware that when you embed an Excel worksheet or chart in another Office 
document and then want to edit it on another computer, that computer 
must have both Excel and the other Microsoft Office program (Word or 
PowerPoint) installed on it.
Use the embedding or linking techniques only when you have a pretty good 
suspicion that the Excel stuff is far from final and that you want to be able 
to update the Excel data either manually (with embedding) or automatically 
(with linking). If your Excel stuff will remain unchanged, just use the old 
standby method of copying the Excel data to the Clipboard with the Copy 
command button on the Home tab (or pressing Ctrl+C) and then switching 
to the Word or PowerPoint document and pasting it in place with the Paste 
command button (or pressing Ctrl+V).
 
Excel maintains a very close relationship with Microsoft Access, thus making 
it easy to import data from any of the tables or queries set up for a database 
into your Excel worksheet. For details on how to bring in data from Access, 
see Book VI, Chapter 2.
Excel and Word 2010
Of all the Office programs (besides our beloved Excel), Microsoft Word 2010 
is the one that you are most apt to use. You will probably find yourself using 
Word to type up any memos, letters, and reports that you need in the course 
of your daily work (even if you really don’t understand how the program 
works). From time to time, you may need to bring some worksheet data or 
charts that you’ve created in your Excel workbooks into a Word document 
that you’re creating. When those occasions arise, check out the information 
in the next section.
Office 2010 Data Sharing Basics

480
Although Word has a Table feature that supports calculations through a kind 
of mini-spreadsheet operation, you probably will be more productive if you 
create the data (formulas, formatting, and all) in an Excel workbook and then 
bring that data into your Word document by following the steps outlined 
in the next section. Likewise, although you can keep, create, and manage 
the data records that you use in mail merge operations within Word, you 
probably will find it more expedient to create and maintain them in Excel — 
considering that you are already familiar with how to create, sort, and filter 
database records in Excel.
Getting Excel data into a Word document
As with all the other Office programs, you have two choices when bringing 
Excel data (worksheet cell data or charts) into a Word document: You can 
embed the data in the Word document, or you can link the data that you 
bring into Word to its original Excel worksheet. Embed the data or charts 
when you want to be able to edit right within Word. Link the data or charts 
when you want to be able to edit in Excel and have the changes automati-
cally updated when you open the Word document.
Happily embedded after
The easiest way to embed a table of worksheet data or a chart is to use the 
good old drag-and-drop method: Simply drag the selected cells or chart 
between the Excel and Word program windows instead of to a new place in 
a worksheet. The only trick to dragging and dropping between programs is 
the sizing and maneuvering of the Excel and Word program windows them-
selves. Figures 4-1 and 4-2 illustrate the procedure for dragging a table of 
worksheet data (with first January sales for the Mission Street store) from its 
worksheet (named Mission Street) into a memo started in Word.
Before I could drag the selected worksheet data, I had to size and position the 
Excel and Word program windows. To do this, I opened the Spring Sales spread-
sheet in Excel and then launched Word and started a new document. To tile the 
windows one above the other, I simply right-clicked the Windows 7 taskbar and 
then clicked the Show Windows Stacked option on its shortcut menu (if you’re 
running Excel on Windows XP, you click the Tile Windows Horizontally option 
to accomplish the same thing).
In Figure 4-1, you can see that the Excel window is positioned below the 
Word window after selecting the Show Windows Stacked option. At that 
point, I had only to select the worksheet data in the Excel worksheet and 
then hold down the Ctrl key (to copy) as I dragged the outline up to the 
Word window.

As I passed over the border between the Excel and Word program windows, 
the mouse pointer changed shape to the international “oh-no-you-don’t” 
symbol. When I reached the safe havens of the Word document area, how-
ever, the pointer changed again, this time to the shape of an arrowhead 
sticking up from a box with a plus sign (how’s that for a description?). To 
indicate where in the Word document to embed the selected data, I simply 
positioned the arrowhead-sticking-up-from-a-box-with-a-plus-sign pointer at 
the place in the document where the Excel stuff is to appear. Then I released 
the mouse button. Figure 4-2 shows you the embedded worksheet table that 
appeared after I released the mouse button.
You can also use the cut-and-paste method to embed worksheet data into 
a Word document. Simply select the cells in Excel and then copy them to 
the Clipboard by clicking the Copy button on the Home tab of the Ribbon 
(Ctrl+C). Then, open the Word document and position the cursor at the 
place where the spreadsheet table is to appear. Click the Paste Special 
option on the Paste button’s drop-down menu on the Home tab of Word’s 
Ribbon (or press Alt+HVS). Click Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object in 
Word’s Paste Special dialog box and then click OK. Word then embeds the 
data in the body of the Word document just as though you had Ctrl+dragged 
the data from the Excel window over to the Word window.
 
If you don’t want gridlines to appear in the worksheet data that you copy to 
a Word document (as shown in Figure 4-2), be sure to remove their display 
in Excel before you do the copying. To remove gridlines from a worksheet, 
you just click the Gridlines check box to remove the check mark in the 
Show/Hide group of the View tab on the Ribbon (or press Alt+WVG).
Editing embedded stuff
The great thing about embedding Excel stuff (as opposed to linking, which 
I get to in a later section) is that you can edit the data right from within 
Word. Figure 4-3 shows the table after I centered it with the Center button 
on Word’s Formatting toolbar. Notice what happens when I double-click 
the embedded table (or click the table once and then choose Worksheet 
Object➪Edit on the table’s shortcut menu): A frame with columns and rows, 
scroll bars, and sheet tabs miraculously appears around the table. Notice, 
also, that the tabs on the Word Ribbon have changed to ones on the Excel 
Ribbon (it’s like being at home when you’re still on the road). At this point, 
you can edit any of the table’s contents by using the Excel commands that 
you already know. In this case, I selected the Page Layout tab and then 
clicked the View check box under the Gridlines heading to remove the cell 
borders from the table.

The links that bind
Of course, as nice as embedding is, you will encounter occasions when link-
ing the Excel data to the Word document is the preferred method (and, in 
fact, even easier to do). First, I select a chart that I created in the worksheet 
by single-clicking it, not double-clicking it, as I would do to edit the chart in 
the worksheet.
Then, after copying the chart (or selected data) to the Clipboard by click-
ing the Copy command on the Excel Ribbon’s Home tab, I switched over 
to Word and my memo to all store managers. After positioning the inser-
tion point at the beginning of the paragraph where the chart needs to be, I 
clicked the Paste Special option on the Paste button’s drop-down menu on 
the Home tab of Word’s Ribbon (you can also do this by pressing Alt+HVS). 
Figure 4-4 shows the Paste Special dialog box that appears. In this dialog 
box, the crucial thing is to select the Paste Link option button and Microsoft 
Excel Worksheet Object in the list box before clicking OK. Figure 4-5 shows 
the Word memo after I clicked OK and pasted the Excel chart into place.

Editing linked data
Editing data linked to Excel (as a chart or cells) is not quite as delightful as 
editing embedded worksheet data. For one thing, you first have to go back to 
Excel and make your changes — although you can easily open Excel and its 
workbook just by double-clicking the linked chart. The nice thing, however 
is that any changes that you make to the original data or chart are immedi-
ately reflected in the Word document the moment you open it.

Excel and PowerPoint 2010
The process of embedding and linking worksheet data and charts in the 
slides of your Microsoft PowerPoint presentations is very similar to the 
techniques outlined for Word. To embed a cell selection or chart, drag the 
data or chart object from the Excel worksheet to the PowerPoint slide. If 
you prefer using the cut-and-paste method, copy the data or chart to the 
Clipboard (Ctrl+C), switch to PowerPoint, and click the Paste Special option 
on the Paste button’s drop-down menu on the Home tab of the PowerPoint 
Ribbon (or press Alt+HVS). Then, make sure that the Microsoft Excel 
Worksheet Object is selected in the As list box and the Paste option button 
is selected in PowerPoint’s Paste Special dialog box before you click OK.
If you want to link Excel data or a chart that you pasted into a PowerPoint 
presentation slide to its source Excel workbook, the only thing you do differ-
ently is to click the Paste Link option button in the Paste Special dialog box 
before you click OK.
 
Sometimes, after making changes to the linked data or chart in Excel, you 
need to manually update the link in the PowerPoint presentation slide to 
ensure that your presentation has the latest and greatest version of the 
Excel data. To manually update a linked table of Excel spreadsheet data or 
a linked chart, go to the slide in question, right-click the table or chart, and 
then click Update Link on its shortcut menu.
Figure 4-6 illustrates how easy it is to edit a chart that you create in Excel 
and then copy to a PowerPoint 2010 slide. To edit the copied chart from 
in PowerPoint, all I have to do is click the chart area on the slide. The 
PowerPoint Ribbon then adds a Chart Tools contextual tab to its Ribbon. 
Here, you see the PowerPoint Ribbon after clicking the Design tab so that I 
can select a new style for the pie chart from the Chart Styles gallery.
Excel and Outlook 2010
Microsoft Outlook 2010 gives you access to a group of powerful utilities for 
scheduling and managing personal information and doing e-mail rather than 
a standard application program, such as Word 2010 or Excel 2010. Among its 
useful utilities are
 
✦ The Contacts module, where you can store all sorts of information about 
the people that you deal with day in and day out
 
✦ The Calendar module, where you can schedule your appointments
 
✦ The Tasks module, where you can keep track of all the thousands of 
things that you need to get done

You can use Outlook’s File➪Open➪Import command to exchange data 
between an Excel spreadsheet and any Outlook folder, such as Contacts, 
Calendar, or Tasks (heck, you can export your e-mail messages to an Excel 
workbook from the Inbox, Drafts, or Outbox folders).
When you choose the File➪Open➪Import command from the Outlook menu 
bar, the program starts the Import and Export Wizard. Figure 4-7 shows 
the first dialog box in this wizard where you choose the type of action to 
perform. To bring data from an Excel worksheet file into one of the Outlook 
modules or folders, click the Import from Another Program or File item in 
the Choose an Action to Perform list box. To export Outlook data from one 
of its modules or folders into an Excel workbook, click the Export to a File 
item at the very top of this list box.
The following steps guide you through exporting the data in your Outlook 
2010 Contacts folder into a new Excel workbook file. The steps for exporting 
other folders (such as the Inbox or Tasks folder) are almost the same. The 
steps for importing the data stored in an Excel worksheet into one of your 
Outlook folders are very similar, except that instead of specifying Excel as 
the type of file to create, you specify it as the type of file to import.

the fields that you specified, it saves it to the new Excel workbook file. You 
can then open this file in Excel and work with this data as though you had 
entered it directly into an Excel worksheet.
Using Smart Tags
The Smart Tag feature provides another way to link certain types of informa-
tion that you enter into your spreadsheet with other sources. A Smart Tag is 
automatically attached to a cell when Excel recognizes its contents as being 
of a certain type of data. For example, when you install Excel, it provides you 
with two basic types of Smart Tags:
 
✦ Date (XML) enables you to look up a date you enter in your worksheet in 
the calendar in Microsoft Outlook 2010.
Using Smart Tags

490
 
✦ Financial Symbol enables you to insert stock quote information for a 
stock symbol that you enter — you can also visit the MSN MoneyCentral 
Web site and get information about the company who issued the stock, 
the stock performance, or any related news about the company and its 
business.
Excel indicates that it has recognized the data that you’ve entered into a cell 
as a type of Smart Tag data by inserting a purple triangle in the lower-right 
corner of the cell. When you position the thick white-cross pointer on the 
cell, the Smart Tag indicator appears. When you then position the mouse 
pointer on the Smart Tag indicator, a drop-down button appears. When 
clicked, the button displays a drop-down menu with a list of items represent-
ing the different actions that you can perform with the Smart Tag (these vary 
with the type of Smart Tag information involved).
Before you can use the Date (XML) and the Financial Symbol Smart Tags that 
are installed with Excel, you must activate the Smart Tag feature in the pro-
gram. To do this, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Click File➪Options➪Proofing or press Alt+FIP.
 
 Excel opens the Proofing tab of the Excel Options dialog box containing 
the AutoCorrect options.
 
2. Click the AutoCorrect Options command button.
 
 Excel opens the AutoCorrect dialog box with the AutoCorrect, 
AutoFormat As You Type, and Smart Tags and Math AutoCorrect tabs, 
as shown in Figure 4-10.
 
3. Click the Label Data with Smart Tags check box on the Smart Tags tab 
to put a check mark in it.
 
 Excel activates the options on the Smart Tags tab (indicated by the fact 
they’re no longer grayed out and you can now select and de-select the 
Smart Tag recognizers you want to use).
 
4. Click the check boxes for all the other recognizers you want active in 
Excel by clicking their check boxes to put a check mark in them.
 
5. Click OK to close the AutoCorrect dialog box and then click OK again 
to close the Excel Options dialog box.
After you activate Smart Tags in Excel, they start popping up in the cells of 
the worksheet as you enter your data, indicated by both the purple triangle 
in the lower-right cell corner and the Smart Tag indicator.

If you think that both the triangle and Smart Tag indicator are a bit much, 
you can change how Smart Tags appear in the worksheet. Simply open the 
Smart Tags tab in the AutoCorrect dialog box and then click the drop-down 
button attached to the Show Smart Tags As drop-down list box; you can 
then choose between the None and Button Only menu option. Of course, 
choosing None renders all your Smart Tags invisible (and thus, unusable). 
However, by choosing the Button Only option, you remove the purple tri-
angles from the cells, while still retaining the ability to display the Smart Tag 
indicator by passing the mouse pointer over the cell and to open its action 
menu by clicking its drop-down button.
 
Excel doesn’t save the Smart Tags that it identifies in your worksheets 
unless you embed them in the sheet before saving the workbook. To 
do this, click the Embed Smart Tags in This Workbook check box at the 
bottom of the Smart Tags tab of the AutoCorrect dialog box and then save 
the workbook.
Adding more Smart Tags
The eServices part of the Microsoft Office Web site has a bunch of different 
types of Smart Tags that you can download and add for use in Microsoft 
Office programs, such as Excel. 
To get new Smart Tags for Excel, click the More Smart Tags button on the 
Smart Tags tab of the AutoCorrect dialog box. When you do this, Excel 
opens your Web browser, which then takes you to the Available Smart 
Tags page of the Office Marketplace Web site, where you can follow links 
for getting Smart Tags in three major categories: Communication Services, 
Reference, and News & Travel.

Using the Financial Symbols Smart Tag
If your work involves tracking stocks in your spreadsheets, you’ll appreci-
ate the power and convenience of the Smart Tag lists (MSN MoneyCentral 
Financial Symbols) Smart Tag. All you have to do is enter a bona fide stock 
symbol in the cell of a worksheet to have it recognized as being a member of 
this type of data.
Figures 4-11 and 4-12 illustrate how this works. In cell A1, I input the text 
entry, MSFT, in all caps (which just happens to be the stock indicator for our 
beloved Microsoft Corporation). No sooner had I pressed the Enter key than 
Excel inserted a purple triangle in the lower-right corner of the cell, signify-
ing that the program recognized this cell entry as constituting a Smart Tag.
In Figure 4-11 you see the particular Smart Tag drop-down menu associated 
with the Financial Symbol Smart Tag. You open this menu by clicking the 
drop-down button attached to its Smart Tag indicator. For this particular 
example, I clicked the Insert Refreshable Stock Price option to import the 
Stock Quotes table provided by MSN Money, shown in Figure 4-12.

If you click the Stock Quote on the MSN Money Central option on the MSFT 
Smart Tag’s drop-down menu, Excel launches your Web browser and con-
nects you to the Money page on the MSN Web site with the current quote on 
Microsoft’s stock. This Web page gives you complete and current Microsoft 
stock quote information that you can then bring into Excel by doing a Web 
query (see Book VI, Chapter 2).
Saving Workbooks in Other Usable File Formats
Sometimes you may need to share worksheet data with coworkers and cli-
ents who do not have Excel installed on their computers. Therefore, they 
can’t open up and print Excel workbook files saved either in the default .xlsx 
XML file format favored by Excel 2007 and 2010 or in the older .xls binary 
format used in versions 97 through 2003.
Saving Workbooks in Other Usable File Formats

For those rare occasions (for it’s just hard to imagine anybody getting by 
without Excel installed on their computers), you can convert your Excel 
workbook to one of three usable file formats for opening and printing with 
readily-available software programs that support them:
 
✦ PDF files for opening with Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat
 
✦ XPS files for opening with the XML Paper Specification Viewer or newer 
Web browser such as Internet Explorer 7
 
✦ HTML files for opening with all types and versions of Web browsers
Saving worksheets as PDF files
The PDF (Portable Document File) file format, developed by Adobe Systems 
Incorporated, enables people to open and print documents without any 
access to the original programs with which the documents were created. All 
they then need installed in order to be able to open and print the worksheet-
as-PDF file is a copy of Adobe Reader (a free download from www.adobe.
com) or a copy of Adobe’s Acrobat software.
Excel 2010 enables you to save your workbook files directly in this special 
PDF file format. To save a workbook as a PDF file, click the File➪Save & Send 
and then click the Create PDF/XPS Document button in the left hand column 
followed by the Create a PDF/XPS button in the right hand column.
Excel then opens Publish as PDF or XPS dialog box (which is laid out much 
like the regular Save As dialog box) where PDF (*.pdf) is automatically 
selected as the file type and you can modify the filename and the drive and 
folder in which the new PDF file is saved.
At the bottom of this Publish as PDF or XPS dialog box, you find the follow-
ing options:
 
✦ Open File after Publishing check box (selected by default) to have 
Excel automatically open the new workbook saved as PDF file in your 
copy of Adobe Reader or Acrobat
 
✦ Optimize For Standard (Publishing Online and Printing (selected by 
default) or Minimum Size (Publishing Online) option buttons

Note that if you need to restrict which parts of the current workbook are 
included in the new PDF file or don’t want non-printing information included 
in the resulting file, click the Options button that appears immediately above 
the Publish button. Doing this opens the Options dialog box where you can 
select the part of the workbook or worksheet to publish and choose to not 
have the document properties and accessibility tags included in the result-
ing PDF file.
After you designate the filename and file location and select your PDF file 
options, click the Publish button to have Excel save the workbook (or some 
part of it) in a new PDF file that automatically opens in your computer’s 
Adobe Reader or Acrobat.
 
If you create an Excel 2010 workbook that incorporates new features not 
supported in earlier versions of Excel, instead of saving the workbook as an 
.xls file, thereby losing all of its 2010 enhancements, consider saving it as a 
PDF file so that coworkers still using pre-2007 Excel versions can still have 
access to the data in all its glory via the Adobe Reader.
Saving worksheets as XPS files
The XPS (XML Paper Specification) file format also enables people to open 
and print Excel worksheets without access to the Excel program. In fact, 
spreadsheets saved in the XPS file format can be opened by anyone who 
uses Internet Explorer 8 on Windows 7 or Vista or uses Internet Explorer 6 or 
higher after installing Win FX Runtime Components or, barring that, a special 
XML Paper Specification Viewer (that is a free download from the Microsoft 
Web site at www.microsoft.com).
To save a workbook as an XPS file, click the File menu and then click File➪
Save & Send and then click the Create PDF/XPS Document button in the left 
hand column followed by the Create a PDF/XPS button in the right hand 
column. Then, be sure to click the XPS Document (*.xps) option on the Save 
as Type drop-down list box.
If you don’t need to edit the filename (Excel automatically appends .xps to 
the current filename) or the folder location, simply click the Publish button, 
and Excel will save the workbook in an XPS file.
If you want Excel to automatically open the new XPS file for your inspection 
in Internet Explorer or the XML Paper Specification Viewer, make sure that 
the Open File after Publishing check box is selected before you click the 
Publish button.
Saving Workbooks in Other Usable File Formats

By default, the Standard (Publishing Online and Printing) option button is 
selected in the Optimize For section at the bottom of the Publish as PDF or 
XPS dialog box. If you want to make your XPS file version of the spreadsheet 
smaller for viewing online, click the Minimum Size (Publishing Online) option 
button before you click the Publish button. Also, if you need to restrict 
which parts of the current workbook are included in the new XPS file or 
don’t want non-printing information included in the resulting file, open the 
Options dialog box by clicking the Options button and select the part of the 
workbook or worksheet to publish and choose which non-printing informa-
tion to omit from the resulting XPS file.
Saving worksheets as HTML files
If converting your worksheets to PDF or XPS files is way too complex for 
your needs, you can save your worksheets as good old HTML files for view-
ing and printing in anybody’s Web browser (as well as for publishing to your 
Web site). To save:
 
1. Click File➪Save As or press Alt+FA to open the Save As dialog box and 
then click Web Page (*.htm,*html) on the Save as Type drop-down 
list.
 
 Excel opens the Save As dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 4-13.

2. Select the folder in which you want to save the HTML file with the 
Favorites or Folders in the Navigation pane on Windows 7 or Vista or 
in the Save In drop-down list box on Windows XP.
 
 Next, you need to give a new filename to your Web page in the File Name 
text box. Note that Excel automatically appends the filename extension 
.htm (for Hypertext Markup page) to whatever filename you enter here. 
When selecting a filename, keep in mind that some file servers (espe-
cially those running some flavor of UNIX) are sensitive to upper- and 
lowercase letters in the name.
 
3. Enter the filename for the new HTML file in the File Name text box.
 
 By default, Excel selects the Entire Workbook option button, mean-
ing that all the worksheets in the workbook that contain data will be 
included in the new HTML file. To save only the data on the current 
worksheet in the HTML file, you need to take Step 4.
 
4. (Optional) If you want only the current worksheet saved in the new 
HTML file, click the Selection: Sheet option button.
 
 If you want, you can have Excel add a Page title to your new HTML file by 
taking Step 5. The page appears centered at the top of the page right above 
your worksheet data. Don’t confuse the Page title with the Web page header 
that appears on the Web browser’s title bar — the only way to set the Web 
page header is to edit this HTML tag after the HTML file is created.
 
5. (Optional) If you want to add a Page title to your HTML file, click the 
Change Title button and then type the text in the Page Title text box 
in the Set Page Title dialog box before you click OK.
 
 You’re now ready to save your spreadsheet as an HTML file by click-
ing the Save button. If you want to see how this file looks in your Web 
browser immediately upon saving it, click the Publish button to open 
the Publish as Web Page dialog box and save the file from there after 
selecting the Open Published Web Page in Browser check box. And if 
you want Excel to automatically save an HTML version of the worksheet 
each time you save the workbook, you click the AutoRepublish Every 
Time This Workbook Is Saved check box as well.
 
6. Click the Save button to save the file without opening it in your Web 
browser. Otherwise, click the Publish button so that you can see the 
Web page in your browser right after saving it.
 
 If you click the Save button, Excel closes the Save As dialog box, saves 
the file to disk, and returns to the Excel window (that now contains the 
HTML version of your workbook or worksheet in place of the original 
.xls file).
Saving Workbooks in Other Usable File Formats

498
 
 If you click the Publish button to view the new HTML file in your 
browser, Excel opens the Publish as Web Page dialog box, where you 
click the Open Published Web Page in Browser check box to put a check 
mark in it before clicking the Publish button.
 
7. Click the Open Published Web Page in Browser check box and then 
click the Publish button.
 
 When you click the Publish button, Excel closes the Publish As Web 
Page dialog box, saves the spreadsheet as an HTML file, and then imme-
diately launches your default Web browsing program while at the same 
time opening the new HTML file in the browser. After you finish looking 
over the new HTML file in your Web browser, click its program window’s 
Close button to close the browser and HTML file and to return to Excel 
and the original worksheet.
 
If you add the Web Page Preview and Web Options commands as custom 
buttons to the Quick Access toolbar or a custom tab on the Ribbon, you 
can use them to preview how a worksheet will appear as a Web page locally 
in your Web browser as well as control a whole variety of Web page save 
options. To add these buttons, open the Customization tab of the Excel 
Options dialog box (Alt+FIC) and click either Customize Ribbon or Quick 
Access Toolbar before you add the Web Page Preview and Web Options 
from Commands Not in the Ribbon section (see Book I, Chapter 3 for 
details).
Publishing Workbooks to Shared Spaces
If you work in a large enterprise, you may share some of your worksheets 
by publishing them on a centralized document management server or to a 
Microsoft SharePoint site. Once there, team members and selected clients 
can then access the worksheet data either by opening their workbook files 
in Excel 2010 for editing or in a Web browser, such as Internet Explorer 8, for 
reviewing and printing.
Sharing a workbook on a SharePoint Web site
If your company maintains a SharePoint site to facilitate different kinds of 
online team collaboration, you can save the workbooks to which various 
teams need access directly on this special Web site. When saving a work-
book to a SharePoint site, you can save a static copy so that the teams can

simply review and refer to its data or you can save a more dynamic copy 
(using Microsoft’s Excel Services server technology) that enables teams to 
make changes and do certain types of online analysis in their Web browsers.
To save a static copy of your workbook, select File➪Save & Send➪Save to 
SharePoint and then click the Save to SharePoint button on the right side 
of the Send panel (or simply press Alt+FHSA). To save a more dynamic and 
calculable copy of the workbook, select File➪Save & Send➪Publish to Excel 
Services and then click the Publish to Web Services command button. In 
either case, Excel then opens the Save As dialog box where you replace 
the suggested filename in the File Name text box with the URL of your 
SharePoint site before you click the Save button.
Excel then connects to your SharePoint site (on some systems, after prompt-
ing you for your User Name and password, if the site is hosted) and dis-
plays the Site Content page in the Save As dialog box. You then select the 
SharePoint document library, sub-site, or workspace in which to save the 
workbook by double-clicking its icon or clicking the item and then clicking 
the Open button. When you click the Save button after selecting the location, 
Excel saves a copy of the workbook directly on the SharePoint server.
 
If you only need to publish a specific table of data in one of your worksheets 
to your SharePoint site (as a SharePoint list), format the data as a table 
(using the Format as Table button on the Home tab) and then click the 
Export button on the Table Tools Design tab followed by the Export Table to 
SharePoint List option. Excel opens an Export to SharePoint List Wizard that 
walks you through the steps of designating the URL of the SharePoint site 
and the name and location of the new SharePoint list.
Uploading workbooks to Windows Live and 
editing them with the Excel Web App
Microsoft offers a wide range of free online applications and services as part 
of its Windows Live Essentials suite. And if you maintain a Windows Live 
(the file storage and sharing component of Windows Live, the first 25 GB of 
storage also being free), you can easily upload copies of your Excel work-
books to this drive for sharing.
To upload an Excel workbook to Windows Live from Excel, you follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click File➪Save & Send➪Save to Windows Live.
 
 Excel adds a Save to Windows Live panel to the right side of the Save & 
Send panel.
Publishing Workbooks to Shared Spaces

2. Click the Go to Windows Live link and then enter your Windows Live 
ID and password.
 
 Excel logs you into Windows Live and then displays the folders you’ve 
created on this drive in the Save to Windows Live panel.
 
3. Click the My Documents folder icon in the Save to Windows Live 
panel to select it and then click the Save As button under the folder 
icons.
 
 Excel opens a Save As dialog box that shows you all the workbook files 
you’ve already saved on the Windows Live.
 
4. If you want to save the workbook file under a new filename or are 
saving the workbook for the first time on Windows Live, edit the file-
name and then click the Save button.
 
 Excel closes the Save As dialog box and uploads the workbook file on 
Windows Live. You can then view the workbook file by logging onto your 
My Documents folder on Windows Live, where you can use the Excel 
Web App to edit (as described later in this chapter).
To upload Excel workbooks from the Web using your Web browser, you first 
need to log on to the My Documents folder of the drive using your Windows 
Live ID and then follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add Files link that appears to the immediate right of the New 
link on the My Document page command line.
 
 Your browser opens the Add Files to My Documents page where you can 
add files by dropping their file icons onto the Drop Files Here list box 
or add them by selecting them in the Select Files to Upload Dialog box 
opened by clicking the Select Files From Your Computer link.
 
2. Use drag and drop or file selection in the Select Files to Upload dialog 
box to add the Excel workbook files you want to store on Windows 
Live.
 
 After adding all the workbook files to copy, you still need to upload 
them.
 
3. Click the Upload button.
 
 Windows Live uploads the selected workbook files that now appear in 
the list of file icons that appear on the My Documents page of Windows 
Live.
When you maintain copies of your spreadsheets on Windows Live, you 
not only can give other client and coworkers access to them (using their 
Windows Live IDs), but you can also edit these worksheets in your Web

browser using the brand new Excel Web App (part of the Office Web Apps 
which also include a Word and PowerPoint Web App, all of which are avail-
able free of charge to users with Windows Live IDs). 
 
The great part about using the Excel Web App to edit a copy of your online 
workbook is that this Web App runs successfully not only under version 8 of 
Microsoft’s own Internet Explorer but also under the latest versions of other 
popular Web browsers, including Mozilla Firefox for Windows, Mac, and 
Linux as well as the Macintosh’s own Safari Web browser.
To edit a workbook you’ve uploaded to the My Documents folder of 
Windows Live, you simply follow these simple steps:
 
1. Open the My Documents page of your Windows Live and then click 
the file icon of the workbook you want to edit.
 
 A Web page showing information about the Excel file you selected 
appears.
 
2. Click the Edit link to the immediate right of the View link on the com-
mand line.
 
 Windows Live then opens up the selected workbook in Excel Web App in 
your Web browser (see Figure 4-14 for an example).

3. Edit the contents of the cells in the worksheets of the open workbook 
and/or the workbook’s formatting (using the tools on the Home tab of 
the Excel Web App Ribbon).
 
 To change the text or number in a cell or to edit its formula on the 
Formula bar, click the cell to make it current and then click the insertion 
pointer in contents of the cell on the Formula bar. To edit the contents 
in the cell itself in the worksheet, make the cell current and press F2.
 
 To modify the layout or formatting of a cell selection, click the appropri-
ate command button in the Font, Alignment, Number, or Cells group on 
the Home tab of the Ribbon. 
 
4. When you finish editing the workbook, save your changes by clicking 
File➪Save As and then editing the filename that appears in the text 
box of the Save As dialog box before you click Save or by clicking the 
Overwrite Existing Files check box (if you want to save the changes 
under the same filename).
 
Although the Excel Web App is fine for making simple editing, formatting, 
and layout changes to your spreadsheet data, it’s clearly not yet sufficiently 
sophisticated to handle complex worksheet changes. Moreover, the Web 
App is incapable of dealing with any type of changes to charts and other 
types of graphics that you’ve added (even though they do appear in the 
worksheet online). To make these types of modifications to your worksheet, 
you have two choices: Open the workbook in a local copy of Excel (assum-
ing that the computer you’re using has Excel 2007 or later installed on it) by 
clicking the Open in Excel button at the end of the Home tab on the Ribbon. 
Alternatively, download a copy of the workbook to your local office com-
puter (where you do have Excel 2010 installed) by clicking File➪Download 
a Copy. Make the more advanced edits to this downloaded copy of the file 
once you get back to the office.

Chapter 1: Charting 
Worksheet Data
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding how to chart worksheet data
✓ Creating an embedded chart or one on its own chart sheet
✓ Editing an existing chart
✓ Formatting the elements in a chart
✓ Selecting the right type of chart
✓ Adding sparklines to worksheet data
✓ Adding a custom chart type
✓ Printing a chart alone or with its supporting data
C
harts present the data from your worksheet visually by representing 
the data in rows and columns as bars on a chart, for example, or as 
pieces of a pie in a pie chart. For a long time, charts and graphs have gone 
hand-in-hand with spreadsheets because they allow you to see trends and 
patterns that you often can’t readily visualize from the numbers alone. 
Which has more consistent sales, the Southeast region or the Northwest 
region? Monthly sales reports may contain the answer, but a bar chart 
based on the data shows it more clearly.
In this chapter, you first become familiar with the terminology that Excel 
uses as it refers to the parts of a chart — terms that may be new, such as 
data marker and chart data series, as well as terms that are probably familiar 
already, such as axis. After you get acquainted with the terms, you begin to 
put them to use going through the simple steps required to create the kind 
of chart that you want either as part of the worksheet or a separate chart 
sheet.
The art of preparing a chart (and much of the fun) is matching a chart type 
to your purposes. To help you with this, I guide you through a tour of all 
the chart types available in Excel 2010, from old standbys, such as bar and 
column charts, to ones that may be new, such as radar charts and surface 
charts. Finally, you discover how to print charts, either alone or as part of 
the worksheet.

Worksheet Charting 101
The typical Excel chart is comprised of several distinct parts. Figure 1-1 shows 
an Excel column chart in a separate document window with labels identifying 
the parts of this chart. Table 1-1 summarizes the parts of the typical chart.
Table 1-1 
Parts of a Typical Chart
Part
Description
Chart area
Everything inside the chart window, including all parts of the chart 
(labels, axes, data markers, tick marks, and other elements in this 
table).
Data 
marker
A symbol on the chart that represents a single value in the spread-
sheet. A symbol may be a bar in a bar chart, a pie in a pie chart, or 
a line on a line chart. Data markers with the same shape or pattern 
represent a single data series in the chart.
Chart data 
series
A group of related values, such as all the values in a single row in 
the chart — all the quarterly sales for Rock CDs in the sample chart, 
for example. A chart can have just one data series (shown in a single 
bar or line), but it usually has several.
Series 
formula
A formula describing a given data series. The formula includes a 
reference to the cell that contains the data series name, references 
to worksheet cells containing the categories and values plotted in 
the chart, and the plot order of the series. The series formula can 
also have the actual data used to plot the chart. You can edit a series 
formula and control the plot order.
Axis
A line that serves as a major reference for plotting data in a chart. In 
two-dimensional charts there are two axes — the x (horizontal/cat-
egory) axis and the y (vertical/value) axis. In most two-dimensional 
charts (except, notably, column charts), Excel plots categories 
(labels) along the x-axis and values (numbers) along the y-axis. Bar 
charts reverse the scheme, plotting values along the y-axis. Pie 
charts have no axes. Three-dimensional charts have an x-axis, a 
y-axis, and a z-axis. The x- and y-axes delineate the horizontal sur-
face of the chart. The z-axis is the vertical axis, showing the depth of 
the third dimension in the chart.
Tick mark
A small line intersecting an axis. A tick mark indicates a category, 
scale, or chart data series. A tick mark can have a label attached.
Plot area
The area where Excel plots your data, including the axes and all 
markers that represent data points.
Gridlines
Optional lines extending from the tick marks across the plot area, thus 
making it easier to view the data values represented by the tick marks.

label linked to an axis such as the Chart Title, Vertical Axis Title, and 
Horizontal Axis Title that you can’t move independently of the chart. 
Unattached text is text that you add such as a text box with the Text 
Box command button on the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
Legend
A key that identifies patterns, colors, or symbols associated with the 
markers of a chart data series. The legend shows the data series 
name corresponding to each data marker (such as the name of the 
red columns in a column chart).

Embedded charts versus charts 
on separate chart sheets
An embedded chart is a chart that appears right within the worksheet so that 
when you save or print the worksheet, you save or print the chart along with 
it. Note that your charts don’t have to be embedded. You can also choose to 
create a chart in its own chart sheet in the workbook at the time you create 
it. Embed a chart on the worksheet when you want to be able to print the 

508
Worksheet Charting 101
chart along with its supporting worksheet data. Place a chart on its own 
sheet when you intend to print the charts of the worksheet data separately.
 
You can print any chart that you’ve embedded in a worksheet by itself with-
out any worksheet data (as though it were created on its own chart sheet) 
by selecting it before you open the Print dialog box.
Creating a new embedded chart
Excel 2010 makes it super easy to create a new embedded chart in your 
worksheet. All you do is follow these three easy steps:
 
1. Select the range of cells containing the data that you want to plot, 
including the column and row headings.
 
 The labels in the top row of selected data become category labels in 
the chart. In other words, they appear along the x-axis in most charts to 
describe the data being charted. The labels in the first selected column 
on the left are used to name the data series in the chart. Excel assigns 
values to appear along the y-axis based on the data in those data series.
 
 To plot only the subtotals or totals in a data table, outline the data table 
(see Book II, Chapter 4, for details), and then collapse the outline down 
to the level that just shows the subtotals or totals, which you can then 
select as a range by dragging through their cells.
 
2. Click the Ribbon’s Insert tab and then click the command button for 
the type of chart you want to create (Column, Line, Pie, Bar, Area, XY 
(Scatter), or Other Charts (to create Stock, Surface, Doughnut, Bubble, 
or Radar charts).
 
 Excel then opens the drop-down gallery for the type of chart you 
selected. This gallery contains thumbnails for all the subtypes available 
under that chart type.
 
3. Click the thumbnail of the subtype of the chart you want to create on 
the chart button’s drop-down gallery.
That’s all there is to it! Figures 1-2 and 1-3 illustrate how fantastically easy 
this process really is. In Figure 1-2, I select the range of data (A3:J7) to be 
graphed as an XY (Scatter) chart, click the XY (Scatter) command button 
on the Insert tab of the Ribbon, and click the Scatter with Straight Lines and 
Markers chart subtype on its drop-down gallery.
Figure 1-3 shows you the result. Here you see the brand-new XY (Scatter) 
chart with straight lines and markers immediately after Excel creates the chart 
in the worksheet. As you can see, when first created, the embedded chart 
partially obscures the data in the table (which now appears selected with 
bounding boxes).

Because the new embedded chart is still selected — indicated by the sizing 
handles in the corners and midsections on the perimeter of the chart (those 
three little dots); the bounding boxes in blue, green, and purple around the 
charted data in the worksheet table; and the selection of the Design tab under 
the Chart Tools contextual tab and the appearance of its command buttons on 
the Ribbon — you can move the embedded chart out of the way to a new loca-
tion by positioning the mouse pointer on its border and then dragging its out-
line to a new position. To also resize it, position the mouse pointer over one of 
eight sizing handles and drag the side or sides as needed.

Moving an embedded chart 
onto its own chart sheet
If it’s really important that the chart remain a 
separate element in the workbook, you can 
move the embedded chart onto its own chart 
sheet. Simply click the embedded chart if it’s 
not already selected in the worksheet and then 
click the Move Chart command button on the 
Design tab of the Chart Tools contextual tab on 
the Ribbon, or press Alt+CCM. Excel then opens 
the Move dialog box where you then click the 
New Sheet option button and click OK to switch 
the embedded chart to a chart on a separate 
chart sheet.

If you don’t even have time to follow these three steps to chart your data, 
you can chart the selected cell range as a clustered column chart (with the 
data series in rows) on its own chart sheet (place in front of the worksheet 
with the selected data) simply by pressing F11. Figure 1-4 shows this chart 
using the same worksheet selected in Figure 1-2.
Keep in mind that all charts that you create are dynamically linked to the 
worksheet that they represent. This means that if you modify any of the 
values that are plotted in the chart, Excel immediately redraws the chart to 
reflect the change, assuming that the worksheet still uses automatic recal-
culation. When Manual recalculation is turned on, you must remember to 
press F9 or click the Calc Now (F9) command button on the Formulas tab of 
the Ribbon (Alt+MB) in order to get Excel to redraw the chart to reflect any 
changes to the worksheet values it represents.
 
If after creating a new chart, you decide that you want to see how your 
data would appear in a different kind of chart, all you have to do is click the 
Change Chart Type command button and then click the type of chart you 
want to try in the Navigation pane on the left (Column through Radar) fol-
lowed by the thumbnail of the subtype of chart in the gallery on the right 
before you click OK.

Refining the chart from the Design tab
You can use the command buttons on the Design tab of the Chart Tools con-
textual tab to make all kinds of changes to your new chart. The Design tab 
contains the following command buttons:
 
✦ Change Chart Type: Click this button to change the type of chart and 
then click the thumbnail of the new chart type in the Change Chart 
dialog box, which shows all the kinds of charts in Excel.
 
✦ Save As Template: Click this button to open the Save Chart Template 
dialog box where you save the current chart’s formatting and layout 
(usually after thoroughly customizing it) as a template to use in creating 
future charts.
 
✦ Switch Row/Column: Click this button to immediately interchange the 
worksheet data used for the Legend Entries (series) with that used for 
the Axis Labels (Categories) in the selected chart.
 
✦ Select Data: Click this button to open the Edit Source Data dialog box, 
where you can not only interchange the Legend Entries (series) with the 
Axis Labels (Categories) but also edit out or add particular entries to 
either category.

✦ Chart Layouts: Click the More button (the last one with the horizontal 
bar and triangle pointing downward) in the Chart Layouts group to 
display all the thumbnails on the Chart Layouts drop-down gallery and 
then click the thumbnail of the new layout style you want applied to the 
selected chart.
 
✦ Chart Styles: Click the More button (the last one with the horizon-
tal bar and triangle pointing downward) in the Chart Styles group to 
display all the thumbnails on the Chart Styles drop-down gallery and 
then click the thumbnail of the new chart style you want applied to the 
selected chart.
 
✦ Move Chart: Click this button to open the Move Chart dialog box, 
where you move an embedded chart to its own chart or move a chart 
on its own sheet to one of the worksheets in the workbook as an 
embedded chart.
Modifying the chart layout and style
As soon as Excel draws a new chart in your worksheet, the program adds the 
Chart Tools contextual tab to the end of the Ribbon and selects its Design 
tab. You can then use the Chart Layouts and Chart Styles galleries to further 
refine the new chart.
Figure 1-5 shows the original XY (Scatter) chart (created in Figure 1-3) 
after repositioning the chart below the table of data, resizing it, and then 
clicking the Layout 1 thumbnail on the Chart Layouts gallery and the Style 
42 thumbnail on the Chart Styles drop-gallery. Selecting Style 42 gives the 
clustered column chart its high contrast, whereas selecting Layout 1 adds 
the generic chart and axis titles and positions them as shown in the figure.
Switching the rows and columns in a chart
Normally when Excel creates a new chart, it automatically graphs the data 
by rows in the cell selection so that the column headings appear along the 
horizontal (category) axis at the bottom of the chart and the row headings 
appear in the legend (assuming that you’re dealing with a chart type that uti-
lizes an x- and y-axis).
You can click the Switch Row/Column command button on the Design tab 
of the Chart Tools contextual tab to switch the chart so that row headings 
appear on the horizontal (category) axis and the column headings appear in 
the legend (or you can press Alt+JCW).

Trying on your choices in the Chart Layouts 
and Chart Styles galleries
When selecting a new layout or style for your 
chart, you can display all the layout and style 
choices in its respective Chart Layouts and 
Chart Styles gallery by clicking that gallery’s 
More button (the one with the horizontal bar 
directly over a triangle pointing downward). 
Although doing this displays the thumbnails of 
all your layout and style choices for the new 
chart, the gallery can also obscure the chart 
in the worksheet so that Live Preview, which 
enables you to see how a layout or style looks 
in the chart before you select it, is rendered 
useless.
To avoid this situation, click the Next Row 
button (the one immediately above the More 
button on each gallery with the triangle point-
ing downward) to bring up and display the 
next row of layout and style choices within 
the height of the Ribbon. That way, you can 
highlight the thumbnails displayed in the single 
row of the Chart Layouts and Chart Styles gal-
leries to see how each looks on the chart with 
Live Preview, and if none of the choices seem 
right, you bring up the next row of the gallery by 
clicking the Next Row button again.

Worksheet Charting 101
Figures 1-6 and 1-7 demonstrate how this works. In Figure 1-6, you see an 
embedded clustered column chart that graphs the quarterly sales of CDs by 
CG Media in 2010 as it was originally created (after resizing and reposition-
ing the chart and applying Layout 9 and Style 26 from the Chart Layouts and 
Chart Styles galleries, respectively, and after replacing the generic Chart 
Title with the actual Quarterly CD Sales by Category title and rotating the 
Vertical Title).
As you can see in Figure 1-6, when Excel created this clustered column chart, 
the program placed the column headings (Qtr 1, Qtr 2, Qtr 3, and Qtr 4) 
on the horizontal (category) axis at the bottom of the chart to identify the 
different clusters of columns, and used the row headings (CDs, Rock, Jazz, 
Classical, and Other) in the legend to identify by color each individual col-
umn’s data bar in every cluster of columns.
Figure 1-7 shows the same clustered column chart after clicking the Switch 
Row/Column command button on the Design tab of the Chart Tools con-
textual tab. Now, column headings (Qtr 1, Qtr 2, Qtr 3, and Qtr 4) are used 
in the legend and the row headings (CDs, Rock, Jazz, Classical, and Other) 
appear along the horizontal (category) axis.

Editing the source of the data graphed in the chart
When you click the Select Data command button on the Design tab of the 
Chart Tools contextual tab (or press Alt+JCE), Excel opens an Edit Data 
Source dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 1-7. The controls in this 
dialog box enable you to make the following changes to the source data:
 
✦ Modify the range of data being graphed in the chart by clicking the Chart 
Data Range text box and then making a new cell selection in the work-
sheet or typing in its range address.
 
✦ Switch the row and column headings back and forth by clicking its 
Switch Row/Column button.
 
✦ Edit the labels used to identify the data series in the legend or on the 
horizontal (category) by clicking the Edit button on the Legend Entries 
(Series) or Horizontal (Categories) Axis Labels side and then selecting 
the cell range with appropriate row or column headings in the work-
sheet.
 
✦ Add additional data series to the chart by clicking the Add button on the 
Legend Entries (Series) side and then selecting the cell containing the 
heading for that series in the Series Name text box and the cells contain-
ing the values to be graphed in that series in the Series Values text box.

516
Worksheet Charting 101
 
✦ Delete a label from the legend by clicking its name in the Legend Entries 
(Series) list box and then clicking the Remove button.
 
✦ Modify the order of the data series in the chart by clicking the series 
name in the Legend Entries (Series) list box and then clicking the Move 
Up button (the one with the arrow pointing upward) or the Move Down 
button (the one with the arrow pointing downward) until the data series 
appears in the desired position in the chart.
 
✦ Indicate how to deal with empty cells in the data range being graphed 
by clicking the Hidden and Empty Cells button and then selecting the 
appropriate Show Empty Cells As option button (Gaps, the default; Zero 
and Span with Line, for line charts). Click the Show Data in Hidden Rows 
and Columns check box to have Excel graph data in the hidden rows and 
columns within the selected chart data range.
The example clustered column chart in Figures 1-6 and 1-7 illustrates a 
common situation where you need to use the options in the Edit Data Source 
dialog box. The worksheet data range for this chart, A2:Q7, includes the 
Compact Disc row heading in cell A3 that is essentially a heading for an 
empty row (E3:Q3). As a result, Excel includes this empty row as the first 
data series in the clustered column chart. However, because this row has no 
values in it (the heading is intended only to differentiate the CD sales from 
the cassette sales in the data table), its cluster has no data bars (columns) 
in it — a fact that becomes quite apparent when you switch the column and 
row headings as in Figure 1-7.
To remove this empty data series from the clustered column chart, you 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the embedded chart to select it and then click the Select Data 
command button on the Design tab of the Chart Tools.
 
 Excel opens the Select Data Source dialog box similar to the one shown 
in Figure 1-8.
 
2. Click the Switch Row/Column button in the Select Data Source dialog 
box to place the row headings (CDs, Rock, Jazz, Classical, and Other) 
in the Legend Entries (Series) list box.
 
3. Click CDs at the top of the Legend Entries (Series) list box and then 
click the Remove button.
 
 Excel removes the empty CDs data series from the clustered column 
chart as well as removing the CDs label from the Legend Entries (Series) 
list box in the Select Data Source dialog box.
 
4. Click the Switch Row/Column button in the Select Data Source dialog 
box again to exchange the row and column headings in the chart and 
then click the Close button to close the Select Data Source dialog box.

After you close the Select Data Source dialog box, you will notice that the 
various colored outlines in the chart data range no longer include row 3 with 
the CDs row heading (A3) and its empty cells (E3:Q3).
Adding hidden rows and columns 
of data to a chart
The sales data graphed in the sample clustered 
column chart shown in Figures 1-6 through 1-8 
only includes the quarterly CD sales totals in 
each music category. To do this, I outlined 
the sales data in this entire table and then 
collapsed the outlined columns down to their 
second level so that only the quarterly sub-
totals and yearly grand totals were displayed 
(see Book I, Chapter 4 for details) before 
selecting the range A2:Q7 as the clustered 
column chart’s data range. Because all the 
columns with the monthly sales data in each 
quarter were hidden at the time I originally cre-
ated the chart (as a result of collapsing the out-
lined columns to the second level), Excel didn’t 
include their data as part of it.
If I decide that I do want to see the monthly 
sales represented in the clustered column 
chart, to accomplish this, all I have to do is 
open the Select Data Source dialog box (by 
clicking the Select Data button on the Chart 
Tools Design tab) and then click its Hidden 
and Empty Cells command button. Excel then 
opens a Hidden and Empty Cell Settings dialog 
box, where I click the Show Data in Hidden 
Rows and Columns check box and then click 
OK. Excel then immediately redraws the chart 
adding columns representing the monthly sales 
to those for the quarterly subtotals in all four of 
its clusters.

Adding a data table to a chart
Sometimes, instead of data labels that can easily obscure the data points in 
the chart, you’ll want Excel to draw a data table beneath the chart showing 
the worksheet data it represents in graphic form. To add the worksheet data 
to your selected chart, click the Data Table button on the Layout tab and 
then click one of these options:
 
✦ Show Data Table to have Excel draw the table at the bottom of the chart
 
✦ Show Data Table with Legend Keys to have Excel draw the table at the 
bottom of the chart, including the color keys used in the legend to differ-
entiate the data series in the first column
 
✦ More Data Table Options to open the Format Data Table dialog box, 
where you can use the options on the Data Table Options, Fill, Line, Line

the Data Table command button’s drop-down menu on the Layout tab of the 
Chart Tools contextual tab (Alt+CJAD).
Editing the chart titles
When Excel first adds titles to a new chart, it gives them generic names such 
as Chart Title and Axis Title (for both the x- and y-axis titles). To replace 
these generic titles with the actual chart titles, click the title in the chart 
itself or click the name of the title on the Chart Elements drop-down list 
(Chart Elements is the very first command button in the Current Selection 
group on the Format tab under Chart Tools — its combo box displays the 
name of the element currently selected in the chart). Excel lets you know 
that a particular chart title is selected by placing selection handles around 
its perimeter.
 
You can also pick up a label that’s entered in a cell of the regular worksheet 
and use it as a title in your chart. Simply select the chart title in the chart, and 
then click the formula bar and select the current text of the title. Next, replace 
the text by typing an equal sign (=) and then clicking the worksheet cell that 
contains the label you want to use as the title before you press Enter.

After selecting a title, you can then click the insertion point in the text and 
then edit as you would any worksheet text, or you can triple-click to select 
the entire title and completely replace it with the text you type. To force part 
of the title onto a new line, click the insertion point at the place in the text 
where the line break is to occur. After the insertion point is positioned in the 
title, press Enter to start a new line.
 
After you finish editing the title, click somewhere else on the chart area to 
deselect it (or a worksheet cell, if you’ve finished formatting and editing 
the chart).

Selecting chart elements for formatting
Excel gives you a choice of methods for selecting individual chart elements:
 
✦ Click the element directly in the chart to select it — use the ScreenTip 
that appears at the mouse pointer to identify the chart object before you 
click to select it.

Book V
Chapter 1
Charting 
Worksheet Data
527
Worksheet Charting 101
 
✦ Click the name of the chart element on the Chart Elements drop-down 
list in the Current Selection group on the Format tab on the Chart Tools 
contextual tab — Excel shows you which element is currently selected 
by displaying its name inside the Chart Elements combo box.
 
After you select an element in the chart by clicking it, you can cycle through 
and select the other elements in succession by pressing the ↑ and ↓ keys. 
Pressing the → key selects the next object; pressing the ← key selects the 
previous object.
 
You can tell when an element is selected in the chart itself because selection 
handles appear around it and its name appears in the Chart Elements combo 
box on the Format tab.
Once a chart element is selected, you can then make any of the following 
changes to it:
 
✦ Format the element by selecting the appropriate command button in 
the Shapes Style group or by clicking the Format Selection button in the 
Current Selection group to open the Format dialog box for that element 
and use its options to make the desired changes.
 
✦ Move the element within the chart by positioning the arrowhead pointer 
in their midst and then dragging their boundary — with some elements, 
you can use the selection handles to resize or reorient the object.
 
✦ Remove the element from the chart by pressing the Delete key.
 
All chart elements have shortcut menus attached to them. If you know that 
you want to choose a command from the shortcut menu as soon as you 
select a part of the chart, you can both select the object and open the short-
cut menu by right-clicking the chart object. (You don’t have to click the 
object with the left button to select it and then click again with the right to 
open the menu.)
Formatting the chart titles
When you select a Chart Layout on the Design tab that adds chart titles to 
your chart, or you add them manually using options on the Chart Title and 
Axis Title command buttons’ drop-down menus on the Layout tab, Excel 
uses the Calibri (Body) font for the chart title (in 18-point size) and the x- 
and y-axes (in 10-point size). To change the font used in a title or any of its 
attributes, select the title and then use the appropriate command buttons in 
the Font group on the Home tab.
 
Use Live Preview to see how a particular font or font size for the selection 
looks in the chart before you select it (assuming that the drop-down menus 
don’t obscure the chart titles). Simply click the Font or Font Size drop-down 
button and then highlight different font names or sizes to have the selected 
chart title appear in them.

528
Worksheet Charting 101
If you need to change other formatting options for the titles in the chart, you 
can do so using the command buttons on the Format tab of the Chart Tools 
contextual tab. To format the entire text box that contains the title, click one 
of the following buttons in the Shape Styles group:
 
✦ Shape Styles More button to display its drop-down gallery where you 
click the thumbnail of a style that formats both the text and text box for 
the selected chart title
 
✦ Shape Fill button to select a new color for the text box containing the 
selected chart title from its drop-down palette
 
✦ Shape Outline button to select a new color for the outline of the text 
box for the selected chart text from its drop-down palette
 
✦ Shape Effects button to apply a new effect (shadow, reflection, glow, 
soft edges, and so on) to the text box containing the selected chart title 
from its drop-down list
To format just the text in chart titles, click one of the various buttons in the 
WordArt Styles group:
 
✦ WordArt Styles More button to display its drop-down gallery where 
you click a thumbnail to apply a new WordArt style to the text of the 
selected chart title (or the text of all chart titles when the Chart Area is 
selected)
 
✦ Text Fill button (the one with the A) to select a new fill color for the text 
in the selected chart title from its drop-down palette
 
✦ Text Outline button (immediately below the Text Fill button) to select 
a new outline color for the text in the selected chart title from it drop-
down palette
 
✦ Text Effects button (immediately below the Text Outline button) to 
apply a text effect (Shadow, Reflection, Glow, Bevel, and so on) to the 
text of the selected chart title from its drop-down list
To get an idea of some of the great effects you can get using these formatting 
options, see Figure 1-10. This figure shows the example clustered column 
chart after selecting the chart area and then applying Colored Fill – Accent 
1 (with a medium blue background with white text) from the Shape Styles 
gallery and the From Center gradient in the Dark Gradients section of the

Formatting the chart axes
The axis is the scale used to plot the data for your chart. Most chart types 
will have axes. All 2-D and 3-D charts have an x-axis known as the horizon-
tal axis and a y-axis known as the vertical axis with the exception of pie 
charts and radar charts. The horizontal, x-axis is also referred to as the 
category axis and the vertical, y-axis as the value axis except in the case of 
XY (Scatter) charts where the horizontal, x-axis is also a value axis just like 
the vertical y-axis because this type of chart plots two sets of values against 
each other.
When you create a chart, Excel sets up the category and values axes for 
you automatically, based on the data you are plotting, which you can then 
adjust in various ways. The most common ways you will want to modify the 
category axis of a chart is to modify the interval between its tick marks and 
where it crosses the value axis in the chart. The most common ways you will 
want to modify a value axis of a chart is to change the scale that they use 
and assign a new number formatting to their units.
To make such changes to a chart axis, click the axis on the Chart Elements 
button’s drop-down list on the Format tab (doing this is a whole lot easier 
than trying to click the actual axis in the chart to select it, although this is 
possible as well) and then click the tab’s Format Selection button to open 
the Format Axis dialog box with the Axis Options tab selected.

Worksheet Charting 101
Figure 1-11 shows you the options that you can modify for the category axis 
in a typical 2-D chart. The options for modifying the category axis include
 
✦ Interval between Tick Marks to modify the spacing between the major 
vertical tick marks (assuming they’re displayed) by entering the whole 
number of units to place between the tick marks in the chart in its text 
box.
 
✦ Interval between Labels to modify the spacing between the axis labels 
by clicking the Specify Interval Unit option button and then entering the 
whole number of units to place between the labels in its text box.
 
✦ Categories in Reverse Order to reverse the order in which the data 
markers and their categories appear on the horizontal axis by clicking 
its check box to put a check mark in it.
 
✦ Label Distance from Axis to modify the distance between the axis labels 
and the horizontal axis by entering a new value between 0 and 1000 in 
its text box.
 
✦ Axis Type to indicate for formatting purposes that the axis labels are 
text entries by clicking the Text Axis option button, or indicate that they 
are dates by clicking the Date Axis option button.
 
✦ Major Tick Mark Type to change how the major vertical tick marks 
intersect the horizontal axis by clicking the Inside, Outside, or Cross 
option on its drop-down list.
 
✦ Minor Tick Mark Type to change how the minor vertical tick marks 
intersect the horizontal axis by clicking the Inside, Outside, or Cross 
option on its drop-down list.
 
✦ Axis Labels to reposition the axis labels from beneath the horizontal 
axis (the Low option) to above the chart’s frame by clicking the High 
option or to completely remove their display in the chart by clicking the 
None option on its drop-down list.
 
✦ Vertical Axis Crosses to reposition the point at which the vertical axis 
crosses the horizontal axis by clicking the At Category Number option 
button. Then enter the number of the category in the chart (with 1 indi-
cating the leftmost category) after which the vertical axis is to cross or 
by clicking the At Maximum option button to have the vertical axis cross 
after the very last category on the right edge of the chart’s frame.
 
✦ Position Axis to reposition the horizontal axis so that its first category 
is located at the vertical axis on the left edge of the chart’s frame and 
the last category is on the right edge of the chart’s frame by clicking the 
On Tick Marks option button.

Selecting the Perfect Chart Type
Selecting the Perfect Chart Type
When you display your data visually, choosing the right chart is probably 
just as important as deciding to use a chart at all. A chart displays the data 
visually, but different charts display the data in very different ways. Certain 
general guidelines may be familiar to you already. Line charts are useful for 
showing changes over time. Pie charts are useful for showing the relation-
ship of parts to the whole.
As you continue to work with Excel 2010, you may find it beneficial to 
become more and more familiar with the chart types available and the 
formats available for those chart types. Using the best chart type and 
format will help you display your data visually in the most meaningful way. 
Following is a discussion of the major chart types available in Excel, with 
some simple guidelines on when to use each type.
Column charts
A column chart, unlike a bar chart to which it is often compared, empha-
sizes variation over a period of time. In a column chart, categories appear 
horizontally and values appear vertically, whereas in a bar chart, categories 
appear vertically.
Figure 1-13 shows the gallery that appears when you click the Column com-
mand button on the Insert tab of the Ribbon or press Alt+NC. This gallery 
contains a variety of subtypes within the five column chart categories: 2-D 
Column, 3-D Column, Cylinder, Cone, and Pyramid.
 
The cylinder, cone, and pyramid chart subtypes are really just variations on 
the three 3-D Column subtypes. Select one of these alternative column chart 
subtypes when you want to assign different shapes to the columns (cylindri-
cal-, conical-, or pyramid-shaped) in your column chart.

Chart

Selecting the Perfect Chart Type
Line charts
A line chart shows the relationship of the changes in the data over a period 
of time. Although similar to an area chart, which shows the relative impor-
tance of values, the line chart emphasizes trends rather than the amount of 
change.
Figure 1-14 shows the gallery that appears when you click the Line command 
button on the Insert tab of the Ribbon or press Alt+NN. This gallery contains 
seven subtypes within the two line chart categories: 2-D Line and 3-D Line.
 
Figure 1-14: 
The Line 
Chart 
gallery 
with its 2-D 
and 3-D 
subtypes.
 
Pie charts
Unlike the other charts discussed so far, which can show multiple data 
series, pie charts contain just one chart data series. A pie chart shows the 
relationship of the parts to the whole.
Figure 1-15 shows the gallery that appears when you click the Pie command 
button on the Insert tab of the Ribbon or press Alt+NQ. This gallery contains 
six different subtypes within the two pie chart categories: 2-D Pie and 3-D 
Pie — note that both categories contain subtypes that explode the individual 
segments.
 
To emphasize the importance of one part, emphasize one “slice” by making 
it a bright color or broad pattern or by labeling it clearly. This is best done 
by choosing one of the various exploded 2-D or 3-D pie charts.

Bar charts
Excel refers to charts with horizontal bars as “bar charts” and those with 
vertical bars as “column charts.” A bar chart (horizontal) emphasizes the 
comparison between items at a fixed period of time.
Figure 1-16 shows the gallery that appears when you click the Bar command 
button on the Insert tab of the Ribbon or press Alt+NB. This gallery contains 
a variety of different subtypes within the five bar chart categories: 2-D Bar, 
3-D Bar, Cylinder, Cone, and Pyramid.

The Bar 
Chart 
gallery

Area charts
An area chart shows the relative importance of values over time. For exam-
ple, an area chart of the sales made by various account representatives over 
the first three months in the quarter might clearly reveal the relative impor-
tance of the sales from each person.
An area chart is similar to a line chart, but because the area between lines is 
filled in, the area chart puts greater emphasis on the magnitude of values and 
somewhat less emphasis on the flow of change over time than the line chart.
Figure 1-17 shows the gallery that appears when you click the Area command 
button on the Ribbon’s Insert tab or press Alt+NA. This gallery contains six dif-
ferent subtypes within the two area chart categories: 2-D Area and 3-D Area.

XY (Scatter) charts
Scatter charts are useful for showing a correlation among the data points 
that may not be easy to see from data alone. You may want to answer such 
questions as, “Does better nutrition mean that athletes have longer careers?” 
or “Do people with better insurance coverage have fewer accidents?” With 
an XY scatter chart, you can chart the two data series — for example, ad 
expenditures and overall sales — and look for a correlation.
An XY (Scatter) chart uses numeric values along both axes instead of values 
along the vertical axis and categories along the horizontal axis. You then 
use a legend to show what the lines represent. If you wish, you can add axis 
labels of your own.
Figure 1-18 shows the gallery that appears when you click the XY (Scatter) 
command button on the Ribbon’s Insert tab or press Alt+ND. This gallery 
contains five different subtypes of the XY (Scatter) chart. Note that only the 
first subtype for comparing pairs of values does not use lines to connect the 
data points (creating, in effect, trendlines for each data series).

Other Charts
All the other types of charts — Stock, Surface, Doughnut, Bubble, and Radar — 
are lumped together on the drop-down gallery that appears when you click 
the Other Charts command button on the Ribbon’s Insert tab or press 
Alt+NO. Figure 1-19 shows you this gallery with these five remaining chart 
types and their various subtypes.
Stock charts
Stock charts, as their name implies, are used to plot stock quotes over a cer-
tain time period, such as a single business day or week. As Figure 1-19 illus-
trates, Excel offers you a choice of four different types of stock charts:
 
✦ High-Low-Close requires that you select three series of data in the high-
low-close order. This means that the high values are in the leftmost 
column (or topmost row), the low values are in the next column to the 
right (or next row down), and the close values are in the rightmost 
column (or bottom-most row) of the data range used in the chart.

Book V
Chapter 1
Charting 
Worksheet Data
537
Selecting the Perfect Chart Type
 
✦ Open-High-Low-Close requires the addition of the opening values to the 
high-close-low values in the order open-high-low-close (meaning that the 
open values must be in the leftmost column or topmost row of the data 
range with all the other values following suit).
 
✦ Volume-High-Low-Close plots the number of shares traded (the volume) 
along with the high-low-close of the stock. As with the other types of 
stock charts, the values in the data range specified for this subtype must 
be arranged in the order volume-high-low-close.
 
✦ Volume-Open-High-Low-Close combines the number of shares traded (the 
volume) with opening, high, low, and close values of the stock. As with the 
other types of stock charts, the values in the data range specified for this 
subtype must be arranged in the order volume-open-high-low-close.

The Other 
Charts

its Stock, 
Surface,

subtypes.
 
Surface charts
Surface charts plot trends in values across two dimensions in a continu-
ous curve. The trends in a surface chart imply the combined effects of two 
variables on a third. For that reason, all the different types of surface charts 
(see Figure 1-19) are 3-D charts that have an x-, y-, and z-axis (the last two 
subtypes are 3-D surface charts shown from above so that they appear to 
be two-dimensional). In order to use a surface, you need at least two data 
series, both of which are numeric as with an XY (Scatter) chart.
Doughnut charts
A doughnut chart is similar to a pie chart except for its ability to display 
more than one data series (pie charts always graph just a single data series). 
Also, because the doughnut has a hole in the middle, you can use this space 
to display additional explanatory text.
Figure 1-19 shows the two types of doughnut charts. The only difference 
between the first and second type is that the second type explodes the vari-
ous segments, which can often be more effective when you want to empha-
size one data group over another.

538
Selecting the Perfect Chart Type
Bubble charts
Bubble charts compare sets of three values as kind of a combination of an 
XY (Scatter) chart with an Area chart. When you build a bubble chart, the 
size of each bubble represented on the x-y grid represents the third set of 
values being charted. The downside to using a Bubble chart to plot data is 
that each bubble takes up so much room that they often overlap each other 
unless you are plotting just a very few data samples. As Figure 1-19 shows, 
Bubble charts are available in only two varieties: The first type draws the 
bubbles as 2-D circles, whereas the second type draws them with a 3-D 
visual effect.
Radar charts
A radar chart shows changes in data relative both to a center point and to 
each other. Each category in a radar chart has its own value axis radiating 
from the center point. Lines connect all the data markers in the same series. 
A radar chart is useful for making relative comparisons among items.
Figure 1-19 shows the three different radar chart types available. The second 
type places data markers at each data point, while the third type fills the 
area covered by each data series in the chart.
Saving a customized chart as a template
After going through extensive editing and formatting of one of Excel’s basic 
chart types, you may want to save your work of art as a custom chart type 
that you can then use again with different data without having to go through 
all the painstaking steps to get the chart looking just the way you want it. 
Excel makes it easy to save any modified chart that you want to use again as 
a custom chart type.
To convert a chart on which you’ve done extensive editing and formatting 
into a custom chart type, you take these steps:
 
1. Click the embedded chart to select it in the worksheet, or click its 
sheet tab if the chart’s on a separate chart sheet.
 
2. Click the Save As Template command button on the Design tab of the 
Chart Tools contextual tab or press Alt+JCT.
 
 Excel opens the Save Chart Template dialog box. The program automati-
cally suggests Chart1.crtx as the filename, Chart Template Files (*.crtx) 
as the file type, and the Charts folder in the Microsoft Templates folder 
as the location.
 
3. Edit the generic chart template filename in the File Name text box to 
give the chart template file a descriptive name without removing the 
.crtx filename extension.
 
4. Click the Save button to close the Save Chart Template dialog box.

Adding Sparkline Graphics to a Worksheet
After creating a custom chart template in this manner, you can then use the 
template anytime you need to create a new chart that requires similar for-
matting by following these steps:
 
1. Select the data in the worksheet to be graphed in a new chart using 
your chart template.
 
2. Click the Dialog Box Launcher button in the lower-right corner of the 
Charts group on the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
 
 The Create Chart dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the Templates option in the Navigation pane of the Create Chart 
dialog box.
 
 Excel then displays thumbnails for all the chart templates you’ve saved 
in the main section of the Create Chart dialog box. To identify these 
thumbnails by filename, position the mouse pointer over the thumbnail 
image.
 
4. Click the thumbnail for the chart template you want to use to select it 
and then click OK.
As soon as you click OK, Excel applies the layout and all the formatting 
saved as part of the template file to the new embedded chart created with 
the data in the current cell selection.
Adding Sparkline Graphics to a Worksheet
Excel 2010 introduces a new type of information graphic that represents 
trends or variations in collected data called a sparkline. Sparklines, — 
invented by Edward Tufte — are tiny graphs (generally about the size of text 
that surrounds them). In Excel 2010, sparklines are the height of the work-
sheet cells whose data they represent and can be any one of following three 
chart types:
 
✦ Line that represents the selected worksheet data as a connected line 
showing whose vectors display their relative value
 
✦ Column that represents the selected worksheet data as tiny columns
 
✦ Win/Loss that represents the selected worksheet data as a win/loss 
chart whereby wins are represented by blue squares that appear above 
the red squares representing the losses
To add sparklines to the cells of your worksheet, you follow these general 
steps:
 
1. Select the cells in the worksheet with the data you want represented 
by a sparkline.

540
Adding Sparkline Graphics to a Worksheet
 
2. Click the type of chart you want for your sparkline (Line, Column, or 
Win/Loss) in the Sparklines group of the Insert tab or press Alt+NSL 
for Line, Alt+NSO for Column, or Alt+NSW for Win/Loss.
 
 Excel opens the Create Sparklines dialog box, which contains two text 
boxes: Data Range, which shows the cells you selected with the data you 
want graphed and Location Range, where you designate the cell or cell 
range where you want the sparkline graphic to appear.
 
3. Select the cell or range of cells where you want your sparkline to 
appear in the Location Range text box and then click OK.
 
 When creating a sparkline that spans more than a single cell, the 
Location Range must match the Data Range in terms of the same amount 
of rows and columns (in other words, they need to be arrays of equal 
size and shape).
 
Because sparklines are so small, you can easily add them to the cells in the 
final column of a table of data. That way, the sparklines can depict the data 
visually and enhance their meaning while remaining an integral part of the 
table whose data they epitomize.
Figure 1-20 shows you a worksheet data table after adding sparklines to the 
table’s final column. These sparklines depict the variation in the sales over 
four quarters as tiny line graphs. As you can see in this figure, when you add 
sparklines to your worksheet, Excel 2010 adds a Sparkline Tools Design tab 
to the Ribbon.

Printing Charts
This Design tab contains buttons that you can use to edit the type, style, 
and format of the sparklines. The final group (called Group) on this Design 
tab enables you to band together a range of sparklines into a single group 
that can share the same axis and/or minimum or maximum values (selected 
using the options on its Axis drop-down button). This is very useful when 
you want a collection of different sparklines to all share the same charting 
parameters so that they equally represent the trends in the data.
Printing Charts
To print an embedded chart as part of the data on the worksheet, you simply 
print the worksheet (from the Print Settings panel in the Backstage view by 
pressing Ctrl+P). To print an embedded chart by itself without the support-
ing worksheet data, click the chart to select it before you press Ctrl+P to 
open the Print panel where the Selected Chart appears as the default selec-
tion in the very first drop-down list box under the Settings heading. To print 
a chart that’s on a separate chart sheet, activate the chart sheet by clicking 
its sheet tab and then press Ctrl+P to open the Print panel, where Active 
Sheet(s) appears in as the default selection for this drop-down list box.
 
When you want to print an embedded chart alone, that is, without its sup-
porting data or in its own chart sheet, you may want to select the print 
quality options on the Chart tab of the Page Setup dialog box (which you 
can open by clicking the Page Setup dialog box launcher button on the 
Page Layout tab) before sending the chart to the printer. The Print Quality 
options on the Chart tab include the following:
 
✦ Draft Quality: Select this check box to print the chart using your print-
er’s draft-quality setting.
 
✦ Print in Black and White: Select this check box to have your color 
printer print the chart in black and white.

Chapter 2: Adding Graphic Objects
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding what graphic objects are and how Excel treats them
✓ Managing graphic objects on the worksheet
✓ Adding clip art to the spreadsheet
✓ Adding text boxes with arrows
✓ Importing graphics files in the worksheet
✓ Adding WordArt text and SmartArt diagrams to the worksheet
✓ Capturing screenshots of the Windows desktop as Excel graphics
✓ Applying graphic themes to the worksheet
Just as charts can really help to clarify trends and implications that 
aren’t readily apparent in your worksheet data, graphics that you add 
to a worksheet can really spruce up your charts and make them read even 
better. Although you may often look to Excel graphic objects as chart 
enhancements, you can also use them to enhance regular spreadsheet data. 
Depending on the type of spreadsheet, you may even end up using graphic 
elements not simply as a way to embellish the data, but also as a superior 
way to actually present it in the worksheet, especially when the data require 
diagrammatic presentation.
Excel supports two types of graphic objects: those that you create yourself 
from the Shapes gallery or with the SmartArt, Text Box, and WordArt com-
mand buttons on the Insert tab of the Ribbon, and those created by others 
that you import with its Picture and Clip Art command buttons. This chapter 
covers how to create graphics with text and text as graphics as well as basic 
graphic shapes. It also covers how to import two different types of graphic 
images: Microsoft’s clip art graphics along with pictures and digital photos 
stored in a variety of different graphics file formats that Excel can read.
Graphic Objects 101
It is important to understand that all graphic objects (including embedded 
charts as covered in Book V, Chapter 1), whether you create them or import 
them, are discrete objects in the worksheet that you can select and manipu-
late. To select a graphic object, you simply click it. Excel lets you know 
that the object is selected by placing white circular sizing handles around 

544
Graphic Objects 101
the perimeter. The program also adds a green circular rotation handle that 
appears directly above and connected to the sizing handle of the graphic’s 
perimeter (the handle is on the top edge, in the middle) if the graphic can be 
rotated. On some drawn objects (especially 3-D ones), yellow diamond shap-
ing handles also appear at the places where you can manipulate some part 
of the object’s shape, as shown in Figure 2-1.
To select multiple graphic objects in the worksheet, hold down the Shift or 
Ctrl key as you click each object. When you select more than one object, any 
manipulations that you perform affect all the selected objects.
To deselect a graphic object, just click the thick, white cross pointer in any 
cell in the worksheet that it doesn’t cover. To deselect an object when you 
have several graphics selected at one time, click an unobstructed cell or 
another graphic.

Manipulating graphics
When you position the mouse pointer on a graphic object’s sizing handle, 
the pointer becomes a double-headed arrow that you can then drag to 
increase or decrease the overall size and shape of the object. To constrain 
a graphic while resizing it, click the sizing handle and then press and hold 
down the Shift key as you drag the mouse. Holding down the Shift key 

Book V
Chapter 2
Adding Graphic 
Objects
545
Graphic Objects 101
restricts your dragging so that the graphic retains its original proportions as 
you make it bigger or smaller. To constrain the proportions of an object in 
two dimensions, hold down the Shift key as you drag one of the corner sizing 
handles.
When you position the mouse pointer on a graphic object’s rotation handle, 
the pointer becomes a curved arrow pointing clockwise. When you click 
and hold down the mouse button to drag the rotation handle, the pointer 
becomes four curved arrows in a circle pointing in the clockwise direction. 
You can then rotate the graphic to any degree in a circle that pivots around 
the rotation handle.
When you position the mouse pointer on a graphic’s shaping handle (if it has 
one), the pointer becomes an arrowhead without any handle. You can then 
drag this pointer to reshape the side or section of the graphic. In the case of 
some 3-D graphic shapes, dragging the shaping handle rotates a part of the 
graphic in such a way that it alters the object’s perspective, thus changing 
the way it’s viewed.
To move the selected graphic object, position the mouse pointer somewhere 
inside the object’s perimeter. Then, when the pointer becomes an arrow-
head with a double-cross at its point, drag the object to its new position 
within the worksheet. To copy the selected object, hold down the Ctrl key 
as you drag the graphic (when you press the Ctrl key, a plus sign, indicating 
that the object is being copied, appears above the arrowhead pointer).
 
When moving graphics in a worksheet, you can make use of an invisible grid 
to help you position them. This is especially helpful when you’re trying to 
align one graphic with another (for example, when aligning two charts side 
by side in a worksheet). To turn on the grid, you do one of the following, 
depending on the type of graphic object:
 
✦ Click the Snap to Grid option on the Align button’s drop-down menu on 
the Format tab on the Drawing Tools contextual tab when the selected 
graphic object is a drawn graphic such as a predefined shape, text box, 
piece of clip art, or WordArt.
 
✦ Click the Snap to Grid option on the Align button’s drop-down menu on 
the Format tab on the Picture Tools contextual tab when the selected 
graphic object is a picture or digital photo imported with the Picture 
command button on the Insert tab.
 
✦ Click the Arrange button on the Format tab on the SmartArt contextual 
tab followed by the Align button and then click the Snap to Grid option 
on its drop-down menu when the graphic object is a piece of SmartArt.
After the Snap to Grid feature is turned on, whenever you position an object 
very close to an invisible horizontal or vertical gridline, it snaps to this line 
as soon as you release the mouse button.

546
Graphic Objects 101
 
You can “nudge” a selected graphic object into its desired position by press-
ing the arrow keys. When you press an arrow key, Excel moves the object 
just a very little bit in that direction. Nudging is very useful when you have 
an object that’s almost in place and requires very little handling to get it into 
just the right position.
If you no longer need a graphic object, you can get rid of it by clicking it to 
select the object and then pressing the Delete key to remove it.
Moving graphic objects to new layers
All graphic objects that you add to a worksheet lay on different invisible 
layers that reside on top of the worksheet and over the worksheet data in 
the cells below. This means that if you move a graphic object over a cell 
that contains an entry, the graphic hides the data beneath it. Likewise, if you 
draw a shape or add an image and then position it on top of another graphic 
object (such as an embedded chart or other shape or picture), it also covers 
up the graphic below.
Figure 2-2 illustrates this situation. In this figure, you see a triangle shape par-
tially covering a star that I’ve drawn on top of a right arrow shape, all on top 
of a clustered column chart created from a nearby table of worksheet data. 
The three graphic shapes, the triangle, star, and arrow, are identified in the 
Selection and Visibility task pane displayed on the right side of the program 
window as Isosceles Triangle 5, 5-Point Star 4, and Right Arrow 3, respectively.

Graphic Objects 101
 
You display the Selection and Visibility task pane by clicking the Selection 
Pane command button on the Format tab on the Chart Tools, Drawing Tools, 
or Picture Tools contextual tab, depending on the type of graphic object 
selected. When a SmartArt graphic object is selected, you need to click the 
Arrange command button before you can click the Selection Pane button on 
the Format tab of the SmartArt Tools contextual tab.
Excel makes it easy to move the graphic objects on the same worksheet to 
other layers using the Selection and Visibility task pane. Simply click the 
name of the object in this task pane that you want to move and then click 
the Bring Forward button (the one with the arrow pointing upward at the 
bottom of the task pane in the Re-order section) or the Send Backward 
button (the one with the arrow pointing downward) to move it. Clicking the 
Bring Forward button moves the selected object up a level in the Selection 
and Visibility task pane just as clicking the Send Backward button moves the 
object down a level.
 
Note that any graphic object that appears above others in the list in the 
Selection and Visibility task pane obscures all the objects below it, provided 
that the objects’ check boxes in the task pane are not empty but contain eye 
icons (meaning that they’re visible in the worksheet) and that the objects 
overlap each other in whole or part in their placement on the worksheet. 
Also keep in mind that you can’t use the Bring Forward and Send Backward 
buttons to move an embedded chart to another layer because this is the one 
type of graphic object that always stays put on the same layer as the work-
sheet — you can, however, move other types of graphic objects that overlap 
the chart a layer beneath the chart by clicking its name followed by the Send 
Backward button.
 
If the Selection and Visibility task pane is not open, you can use the Bring 
to Front and Send to Back command buttons on the Format tab of the Chart 
Tools, Drawing Tools, and Picture Tools contextual tabs to move them to 
new layers:
 
✦ Click the Bring to Front option on the Bring Forward drop-down button 
to bring the selected graphic object to the top of the stack.
 
✦ Click the Send to Back option on the Send Backward drop-down button 
to send the object to the bottom of the stack.
 
✦ Click the Bring Forward button to bring the selected object up to the 
next higher layer.
 
✦ Click the Send Backward button to send the selected object down to the 
next layer.
Figure 2-3 illustrates how easy it is to move a graphic object to a differ-
ent level in the Selection and Visibility task pane. For this figure, I clicked 
Isosceles Triangle 5 in the list and then clicked the Send Backward button 
at the bottom of the task pane in the Re-order area three times. I then clicked 

548
Graphic Objects 101
5-Point Star 4 in the list and clicked the Send Backward button twice. Finally, 
I clicked the Right Arrow 3 in the list and clicked Send Backward just once to 
move it to the bottom of the list in the Selection and Visibility task pane at the 
bottom of the graphics stack in the worksheet, just as they appear in the figure.
Aligning graphic objects
When you’re dealing with two graphic objects, one on top of the other, and 
you want to align them with each other, you can use the options on the Align 
command button’s drop-down menu on the Format tab of the Drawing Tools 
or Picture Tools contextual menu. The alignment options on this button’s 
drop-down menu include
 
✦ Align Left to left align the graphic on the top layer with the one 
underneath
 
✦ Align Center to center the graphic on the top layer with the one 
underneath
 
✦ Align Right to right align the graphic on the top layer with the one 
underneath
 
✦ Align Top to top align the graphic on the top layer with the one 
underneath
 
✦ Align Middle to center vertically the graphic on the top layer with the 
one underneath
 
✦ Align Bottom to bottom align the graphic on the top layer with the one 
underneath
 
✦ Distribute Horizontally to equally distribute the selected graphic 
objects (three or more) horizontally
 
✦ Distribute Vertically to equally distribute the selected graphic objects 
(three or more) vertically
Grouping graphic objects
Sometimes you need to work with more than one graphic object (for example, 
the triangle and star graphic objects in Figures 2-2 and 2-3). If you find that 
you’re constantly selecting two or more objects at the same time in order to 
move them or rotate them together, you can make life a lot simpler by group-
ing the graphics. When you group selected graphic objects, Excel then makes 
them into a single graphic object, which you can then manipulate.
To group a bunch of graphics together, select them all (either by 
Shift+clicking or Ctrl+clicking each one). After they are selected, right-click 
the object on the top layer and then choose Group➪Group on the object’s 
shortcut menu or click the Group option on the Group command button’s 
drop-down menu on the Format tab of the Drawing Tools or Picture Tools 
contextual menu.

Excel indicates that the selected graphics are now grouped in the worksheet 
(and for all intents and purposes, a single graphic object) by placing a single 
set of sizing handles around the perimeter formed by all the former separate 
graphics and by giving them a group number in the Selection and Visibility 
task pane. You can then manipulate the grouped graphic as a single entity by 
moving it, sizing it, rotating it, and so forth as you would any other object.
The great thing about grouping a bunch of different objects is that Excel 
never forgets that they were once separate objects that you could indepen-
dently manipulate. This means that you can always turn them back into 
separate graphics by ungrouping them. To do this, right-click the composite 
graphic object and then choose Group➪Ungroup on its shortcut menu or 
click the Ungroup option on the Group command button’s drop-down menu 
on the Format tab of the Drawing Tools or Picture Tools contextual menu.
Excel shows that the composite object is once again separated into many dif-
ferent objects by displaying sizing handles around each object’s perimeter. 
You can then deselect them all and manipulate each one once again inde-
pendently by selecting it alone before moving, resizing, or rotating it. If you 
decide that you want the now independent objects to be joined as a group 
once again, you can do this by right-clicking any one of the graphics in the 
erstwhile group and then choosing Group➪Regroup on its shortcut menu 
or clicking the Regroup option on the Group command button’s drop-down 
menu on the Format tab.

Figure 2-4 illustrates grouping in action. For this figure, I selected both the 
triangle and star graphic below. In this figure, I’m in the process of choosing 
the Group option on the Group command button’s drop-down menu on the 
Format tab of the Drawing Tools contextual tab, which will turn them into a 
single composite graphic object. After choosing this option, not only will the 
triangle move whenever I reposition the star, but the triangle will also resize 
when I modify the shape, and would rotate together with the star if I were to 
turn the star on its head.
Managing graphic objects in the Selection 
and Visibility task pane
As previously discussed in the “Moving graphic objects to new layers” sec-
tion earlier in this chapter, the Selection and Visibility task pane that you 
display by clicking the Selection Pane button on the Format tab of the Chart 
Tools, Drawing Tools, or Picture Tools contextual tab on the Ribbon makes 
it easy to move graphic objects that overlap one another in some manner to 
different layers in the stack.
 
When dealing with a SmartArt graphic, you have to click the Arrange button 
on the Format tab of the SmartArt Tools contextual tab Ribbon to get access 
to the Selection Pane command button.

In addition to rearranging graphic objects on different layers, you can use 
this task pane to select particular graphic objects for editing or formatting 
as well as to temporarily hide their display in the worksheet:
 
✦ To select a graphic object in the worksheet, click its name in the list 
in the Selection and Visibility task pane — to select multiple graphics, 
press Ctrl as you click their names in the list.
 
✦ To hide a particular graphic object in the worksheet, click the check 
box that appears after its name in the list to remove the eye icon, and to 
redisplay it, click this check box a second time to restore the eye icon.
 
✦ To hide all the graphic objects (including embedded charts) on the 
worksheet, click the Hide All button at the bottom of the task pane, and 
to redisplay them, click the Show All button.
 
Click the graphic object’s name in the Selection and Visibility task pane to 
select it for editing or formatting whenever the object is difficult to select 
directly in the worksheet by clicking its shape or image, which is often the 
case when the object’s part of a stack of graphics.
Importing Graphics
Excel makes it easy for you to import two types of graphic objects into your 
spreadsheet:
 
✦ Clip art: Over 150,000 readymade illustrations are offered by Microsoft for 
use in its various Microsoft Office programs, including Excel 2010. Clip art 
drawings are now so numerous that the images are classified into a bunch 
of different categories ranging from Abstract to Web Elements.
 
✦ Pictures: Digital art and photos saved in various types of graphics file 
formats.
Adding clip art
To bring in a piece of clip art included with Office 2010, you click the Clip Art 
Pane button on the Ribbon’s Insert tab or press Alt+NF. When you do this, 
Excel 2010 displays the Clip Art task pane (similar to the one shown in Figure 
2-5 from which you search for the type of art you want to use). To locate 
the clip(s) you want to insert into the current worksheet in the Clip Art task 
pane, you follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Search For text box at the top, and then enter the keyword(s) 
for the type of clip art you want to find.
 
 When entering keywords for finding particular types of clip art, try 
entering general, descriptive terms such as trees, flowers, people, flying, 
and the like.

552
Importing Graphics
 
2. (Optional) Click the Search In drop-down button and remove (deselect) 
check marks from any clip art collections that you don’t want to search.
 
 By default, Excel searches all the collections of clip art (including the 
Media Gallery Online collection on the Web). To limit your search, you 
need to make sure that only the clip art collections you want to include 
in the search have check marks before their names.
 
3. (Optional) To limit the search to clip art only, click the Results Should 
Be drop-down button and remove check marks from the All Media 
Types, Photographs, Movies, and Sounds categories.
 
 You can further limit the types of clip art files included in the search by 
clicking the plus sign in front of Clip Art and then removing check marks 
from any and all types of clips (such as CorelDraw or Macintosh PICT) 
that you don’t want or need to use.
 
4. Click the Go button to the immediate right of the Search For text box 
to initiate the search.

Click the Find More at Office.com link at the bottom of the Clip Art pane if you 
want to include thousands of additional clip art images and photos from 
Microsoft Office in your search. When you click this link, Windows launches 
your Web browser and displays the Images tab of the Office.com Web site. 
There, you can search for, select, and download clip art images for use in Excel.
 
If you have difficulty finding a piece of clip art, try editing its keywords to 
make finding it the next time easier. To do this, click the image’s drop-down 
button and then choose Edit Keywords on its drop-down menu. Doing this 
opens the Keywords dialog box that shows all the keywords assigned to 
the image. To add your own keyword to the list, enter it into the Keyword 
drop-down text box and click the Add button. Also, if you see an image that 
is close to, but not exactly, what you want, try finding like images by clicking 
the image’s drop-down button, and then choosing Find Similar Style on its 
pop-up menu.
To insert one of the thumbnails displayed in the Clip Art task pane into the 
current worksheet (see Figure 2-6), click the thumbnail. You can also insert 
an image by positioning the mouse over it to display its drop-down button, 
and then clicking the drop-down button and choosing Insert at the top of its 
drop-down menu.

When you insert a clip art image into the worksheet, it is automatically 
selected (indicated by the selection handles around its perimeter and its 
rotation handle at the top). To deselect the clip art image and set it in the 
worksheet, click anywhere in the worksheet outside of the image.
Adding pictures from graphics files
If you want to bring in an image such as a digital photo or a scanned image 
saved in its own graphics file, click the Picture button on the Ribbon’s Insert 
tab or press Alt+NP. This opens the Insert Picture dialog box (which works 
just like opening an Excel workbook file in the Open dialog box), where you 
select the graphics file and then import it into the worksheet by clicking its 
Insert button.
 
If you want to bring in a graphic image created in another graphics program 
that’s not saved in its own file, you select the graphic in that program and 
then copy it to the Clipboard (press Ctrl+C). When you get back to your 
worksheet, place the cursor where you want the picture to go and then 
paste the image in place (press Ctrl+V or click the Paste command button at 
the very beginning of the Home tab).
 
When you insert a picture from a graphics file into the worksheet, it’s auto-
matically selected (indicated by the selection handles around its perimeter 
and its rotation handle at the top). To deselect the graphic image and set it 
in the worksheet, click anywhere in the worksheet outside of the image.
Editing clip art and imported pictures
While an imported clip art image or a picture is selected in your worksheet 
(indicated by the selection handles around its perimeter and a rotation 
handle at the top), you can make any of the following editing changes to it:
 
✦ Move the clip art image or imported picture to a new location in the 
chart by dragging it.
 
✦ Resize the clip art image box or imported picture by dragging the appro-
priate selection handle.
 
✦ Rotate the clip art image or imported picture by dragging its rotation 
handle (the green circle at the top) in a clockwise or counterclockwise 
direction.
 
✦ Delete the clip art image or imported picture by pressing the Delete key.
Formatting clip art and imported pictures
When an imported clip art image or picture is selected, Excel adds the 
Picture Tools contextual tab to the Ribbon and automatically selects its sole 
Format tab.

The Format tab is divided into five groups: Adjust, Picture Styles, 
Background Removal, Arrange, and Size. The Adjust group contains the fol-
lowing important command buttons:
 
✦ Corrections to increase or decrease the picture’s sharpness or bright-
ness and contrast by selecting a new preset thumbnail image or by 
clicking Picture Corrections Options to open the Format Picture dialog 
box, where you can adjust these settings with its Sharpen and Soften or 
Brightness and Contrast sliders.
 
✦ Color to open a drop-down menu, where you can select a new color 
thumbnail for the image or select a transparent color that drops out of 
the picture.
 
✦ Artistic Effects to apply a special effect filter to the image by select-
ing one of the preset thumbnail images or by clicking Artistic Effects 
Options to open the Artistic Effects tab of the Format Picture dialog 
box, where you can select another filter to apply or reset the image by 
removing all previously applied filters.
 
✦ Compress Pictures to open the Compress Pictures dialog box where you 
can compress all images in the worksheet or just the selected graphic 
image to make them more compact and thus make the Excel workbook 
somewhat smaller when you save the images as part of its file.
 
✦ Change Picture to open the Insert Picture dialog box where you can select 
an image in a new graphics file to replace the picture — when replacing the 
currently selected picture with the new image, Excel automatically sizes 
and formats the new image with the settings applied to the old.
 
✦ Reset Picture button to remove all formatting changes made and return 
the picture to the state it was in when you originally inserted it into the 
worksheet.
 
You can also format a clip art image or imported picture by opening the 
Format Picture dialog box (right-click the image and then click Format 
Picture on its shortcut menu) and then selecting the appropriate options on 
its Fill, Line, Line Style, Shadow, 3-D Format, 3-D Rotation, Picture, and Text 
Box tabs.
In addition to the command buttons in the Adjust group, you can use the 
command buttons in the Picture Styles group. Click a thumbnail on the 
Picture Styles drop-down gallery to select a new orientation and style for the 
selected picture or select a new border shape on the Picture Shape button’s 
drop-down palette, border color on the Picture Border button’s drop-down 
color palette, or a new shadow or 3-D rotation effect on the Picture Effects 
button’s drop-down menu.
Figure 2-7 shows the imported Mind over Media, Inc. logo as it’s being for-
matted in Live Preview with Double Frame, Black on the Picture Styles drop-
down gallery. Note that in this style, Excel places the image in an inner light 
black frame surrounded by a much heavier outer frame.

Keep in mind that you can have Excel automatically separate a foreground 
image from its background in a selected picture by clicking the Background 
Removal command button. Excel then applies a violet filter to the back-
ground, surrounding the image in the foreground with an outline with 
selection handles that you can adjust before clicking the Close Background 
Removal button to remove the background leaving only the foreground 
image selected in the worksheet.
Drawing Graphics
The Shapes gallery along with the SmartArt, Text Box, and WordArt com-
mand buttons found on the Insert tab of the Ribbon enable you to draw a 
wide variety of graphic objects. Some of these graphic objects, including the 
callout graphics on the Shapes gallery and all the SmartArt, Text Box, and 
WordArt graphics, enable you to combine text and graphics.
Drawing predefined shapes
The Shapes gallery, opened by clicking the Shapes command button in the 
Illustrations group on the Ribbon’s Insert tab, contains a wide variety of pre-
defined shapes that you can draw in your worksheet simply by dragging the 
mouse pointer.

Book V
Chapter 2
Adding Graphic 
Objects
557
Drawing Graphics
When you open the Shapes gallery, you see that the gallery is divided into 
nine sections: Recently Used Shapes, Lines, Rectangles, Basic Shapes, Block 
Arrows, Equation Shapes, Flowchart, Stars and Banners, and Callouts.
After you click the thumbnail of one of the preset shapes in this drop-down 
gallery, the mouse pointer becomes a crosshair and you use it to draw the 
graphic by dragging it until it’s approximately the size you want.
 
After you release the mouse button, the shape you’ve drawn in the work-
sheet is still selected. This is indicated by the selection handles around its 
perimeter and the rotation handle at the top, which you can use to reposi-
tion and resize it, if need be. In addition, the program activates the Format 
tab on the Drawing Tools contextual tab and you can use the Shape Styles 
gallery or other command buttons to further format the shape until it’s 
exactly the way you want it. To set the shape and remove the selection and 
rotation handles, click anywhere in the worksheet outside of the shape.
 
When drawing a rectangle or an oval, you can constrain the tool to draw a 
square or circle by holding down the Shift key as you drag the mouse. Note 
that when drawing a two-dimensional shape, such as a rectangle, square, oval, 
or circle, Excel automatically draws the shape with a blue fill that obscures 
any data or graphic objects that are beneath the shape on layers below.
 
In addition to drawing your own basic shapes, lines, and arrows from the 
gallery, you can draw block arrows, equation symbols, flow chart symbols, 
banners, and callouts by selecting them from their respective areas on the 
Shapes gallery. Note that, when you draw one of the callouts, Excel posi-
tions the insertion point within the selected callout shape, thus enabling you 
to then enter the text of the callout. After you finish entering the text, click 
somewhere outside the shape to deselect the callout. (See the “Adding text 
boxes” section that follows for information on how to edit and format the 
callout text.)
Adding text boxes
Text boxes are special graphic objects that combine text with a rectangular 
graphic object. They’re great for calling attention to significant trends or 
special features in the charts that you create (see Book V, Chapter 1, for 
details).
To create a text box, click the Text Box command button in the Text group 
on the Ribbon’s Insert tab and then drag the mouse pointer to draw the out-
line of the box. As soon as you release the mouse button, Excel places the 
insertion point in the upper-left corner of the box.
You can then start typing the text that you want displayed in the text box. 
When the text that you type reaches the right edge of the text box, Excel 
automatically starts a new line. If you reach the end of the text box and keep 

558
Drawing Graphics
typing, Excel then scrolls the text up, and you then have to resize the text 
box to display all the text that you’ve entered. If you want to break a line 
before it reaches the right edge of the text box, press the Enter key. When 
you finish entering the text, click anywhere on the screen outside the text 
box to deselect.
 
Keep in mind that although text boxes are similar to cell Comments in that 
they also display the text that you enter in a rectangular box, they do differ 
from Comments in that text boxes are not attached to particular cells and 
are always displayed in the worksheet. (Comments only show when you 
position the mouse pointer over the cell or select the comment with the 
Reviewing toolbar — see Book IV, Chapter 3, for details.)
Note that text boxes differ somewhat from other graphic objects that you 
add to the worksheet. Unlike other graphic objects in Excel, text boxes 
display two different border patterns when you select them: A dotted-line 
pattern is displayed when you click inside the text box, thus enabling you to 
format and edit the text, and a solid-line pattern is displayed when you click 
the border of the text box or start dragging the box to reposition it, thus 
indicating that you can format and edit the box itself.
Formatting a text box
After you’ve added a text box, you can format its text by changing the font, 
font size, font style, and alignment of the text (including its orientation); you 
can also format the text box by changing its background color and line style, 
object positioning properties, and — perhaps most important of all — its 
text margins.
To change the formatting of all the text entered in a text box, click its 
TextBox name in the Selection and Visibility task pane or click its graphic 
object in the worksheet until the solid outline appears around the box, and 
then click the appropriate command buttons in the Font and Alignment 
groups on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Choose from the following options:
 
✦ Font or Font Size drop-down list buttons and the Increase Font Size and 
Decrease Font Size command buttons to change the font or font size of 
the text — use Live Preview to see how the new font and font size looks 
in the text box.
 
✦ Bold, Italic, or Underline command buttons to add these attributes to 
the text in the text box.
 
✦ Font Color drop-down list button to apply a new color to the text in the 
text box.
 
✦ Align Text Left, Center, or Align Text Right command buttons to 
change the horizontal alignment of the text in regards to the left and 
right edges of the text box.

Book V
Chapter 2

✦ Top Align, Middle Align, or Bottom Align command buttons to change 
the vertical alignment of the text in regards to the top and bottom edges 
of the text box.
 
✦ Increase Indent or Decrease Indent command buttons to indent text 
within the box’s borders or remove previous indenting.
 
✦ Orientation command button to modify the orientation of the text in 
the text box by selecting the Vertical Text, Rotate Text Up, or the Rotate 
Text Down option.
 
To change the formatting of some of the text in a text box, click the insertion 
point in the text box and select the text before you use one of these com-
mand buttons to modify its appearance.
To change the formatting of the text box itself, click its TextBox name in the 
Selection and Visibility task pane (opened by clicking the Selection Pane 
button on the Drawing Tools Format tab) or click its graphic object in the 
worksheet until the solid outline appears around the box, then click the 
Drawing Tools Format tab on the Ribbon, and then choose among the follow-
ing formatting options:
 
✦ Edit Shape drop-down list button (the one with the dots around the 
graphic object in the Insert Shapes group) to change the text box shape 
or edit the wrap points. 
 
✦ Text Box drop-down list button to convert a horizontal text box to a ver-
tical text box by clicking the Vertical Text Box option
 
✦ Shape Styles gallery to select a new outline, fill, and text color all at one 
time by clicking one of the gallery’s thumbnails (after using Live Preview 
to see how the new color scheme looks)
 
✦ Shape Fill drop-down list button to select a new color, gradient, picture, 
or texture for the text box fill or to remove any existing fill (by clicking 
the No Fill option)
 
✦ Shape Outline drop-down list button to select a new color, line weight, 
or line style for the outline of the text box or to remove its outline (by 
clicking the No Outline option)
 
✦ Shape Effects drop-down list button to select a new special effect such 
as a shadow, glow, or other 3-D effect using the options and palettes 
available from its drop-down menu
 
✦ WordArt Styles drop-down palette to apply a new WordArt style for 
the text in the text box by clicking one of the gallery’s thumbnails (after 
using Live Preview to see how the new WordArt text style looks)
 
✦ Text Fill drop-down list button (the one with the A with a line drawn 
under it) to select a new fill color, gradient, picture, or texture for the 
text in the text box or to remove any existing fill color (by clicking the 
No Fill option)

560
Drawing Graphics
 
✦ Text Outline drop-down list button (the one with the pencil added to 
the A with the line drawn under it) to select a new color, line weight, or 
line style for the text in the text box or to remove its current outline (by 
clicking the No Outline option)
 
✦ Text Effects drop-down list button to select a new special effect such as 
a shadow, glow, or other 3-D effect for the text in the text box using the 
options and palettes available from its drop-down menu
 
When you first enter the text in a text box, Excel sets pretty scanty internal 
margins so that there’s not a lot of white space between the text characters 
and the edge of the text box. If you’re anything like me, one of the first things 
that you’ll want to do is add decent margins to the text box.
To do this, open the Format Shape dialog box while the text box is selected 
by right-clicking the text box and then clicking Format Shape on its shortcut 
menu. Then, click the Text Box tab and enter the new values (in fractions of 
an inch) that you want to use in the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right text boxes 
in the Internal Margin section. Also, click the Resize Shape to Fit Text check 
box in the AutoFit section to put a check mark in it if you want Excel to auto-
matically resize the text box to suit any formatting changes you make to its 
text (like increasing the font size, adding bold, or selecting a new text align-
ment).
Editing the text in a text box
You can edit the text in a text box as you would in any cell of the worksheet. 
To insert new text, click the insertion point at the appropriate place and 
start typing. To delete text, press the Backspace key to delete characters 
to the left of the insertion point or the Delete key to delete characters to 
its right. To delete an entire section of text, select it with the I-beam mouse 
pointer and then press the Delete key.
To spell check some or all of the text in the text box, select the text by drag-
ging the I-beam mouse pointer through it and then click the Spelling button 
on the Review tab of the Ribbon (or just press F7).
To delete a text box from the worksheet, click its border to select the box 
(indicated by the solid outline) and then press the Delete key. Be sure that 
you don’t click inside the box because this only selects the text (indicated 
by the dotted outline), in which case, pressing the Delete key doesn’t get rid 
of anything but characters of text at the cursor’s position.
Adding an arrow to a text box
When creating a text box, you may want to add an arrow to point directly to 
another graphic object or to the part of an embedded chart to which you’re 
referencing. To add an arrow, follow these steps:

Book V
Chapter 2
Adding Graphic 
Objects
561
Drawing Graphics
 
1. Click the text box to which you want to attach the arrow in the chart 
or worksheet to select it.
 
 Selection handles appear around the text box and the Format tab on the 
Drawing Tools contextual tab is selected on the Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Arrow command button in the Insert Shapes drop-down gal-
lery at the very beginning of the Format tab.
 
 The Arrow command button is the second from the left in the Lines sec-
tion of Shapes gallery (with the picture of an arrow). When you click this 
button, it becomes selected in the gallery palette (indicated by the new 
color) and the mouse pointer assumes the crosshair shape.
 
3. Drag the crosshair mouse pointer from the place on the text box 
where the end of the arrow (the one without the arrowhead) is to 
appear to the place where the arrow starts (and the arrowhead will 
appear) and release the mouse button.
 
 As soon as you release the mouse button, Excel draws two points, one 
at the base of the arrow (attached to the text box) and another at the 
arrowhead. At the same time, the contents of the Shape Styles drop-
down gallery changes to line styles.
 
4. Click the More button in the lower-right corner of the Shapes Styles 
drop-down gallery to display the thumbnails of all its line styles and then 
mouse over the thumbnails to see how the arrow would look in each.
 
 As you mouse through the different line styles in this gallery, Excel 
draws the arrow between the two selected points in the text box using 
the highlighted style.
 
5. Click the thumbnail of the line style you want the new arrow to use in 
the Shape Styles gallery.
Excel then draws a new arrow using the selected shape style, which remains 
selected (with selection handles at the beginning and end of the arrow). You 
can then edit the arrow as follows:
 
✦ Move the arrow by dragging its outline into position.
 
✦ Change the length of the arrow by dragging the selection handle at 
the arrowhead.
 
✦ Change the direction of the arrow by pivoting the mouse pointer around 
a stationary selection handle.
 
✦ Change the shape of the arrowhead or the thickness of the arrow’s 
shaft by clicking a thumbnail on the Shape Styles drop-down gallery 
or clicking a new option on the Shape Fill, Shape Outline, and Shape 
Effects button on the Format tab of the Drawing Tools contextual tab. 
Alternatively, open the Format Shape dialog box (Ctrl+1) and then select 
the appropriate options on its Fill, Line, Line Style, Shadow, 3-D Format, 
3-D Rotation, Picture, and Text Box tabs.
 
✦ Delete the arrow by pressing the Delete key.

Inserting WordArt
The WordArt gallery, opened by clicking the WordArt command button in 
the Text group of the Insert tab of the Ribbon, makes it a snap to add really 
artsy text to the worksheet. The only thing to keep in mind when adding 
WordArt is that, just as its name implies, this text is really a graphic (art) 
object that behaves just like any other Excel graphic object although it con-
tains only text!
You can easily add this type of “graphic” text to your worksheet by following 
these steps:
 
1. Click the WordArt command button on the Insert tab of the Ribbon or 
press Alt+NW.
 
 Excel displays the WordArt drop-down gallery dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 2-8.

2. Click the A thumbnail in the WordArt style you want to use in the 
WordArt drop-down gallery.
 
 Excel inserts a selected text box containing Your Text Here in the 
center of the worksheet with this text in the WordArt style you selected 
in the gallery.
 
3. Type the text you want to display in the worksheet in the Text text 
box.
 
 As soon as you start typing, Excel replaces the Your Text Here text in 
the selected text box with the characters you enter.
 
4. (Optional) To format the background of the text box, use Live Preview 
in the Shape Styles drop-down gallery on the Format tab to find the 
style to use and then set it by clicking its thumbnail.
 
 The Format tab on the Drawing Tools contextual tab is automatically 
added and activated whenever WordArt text is selected in the work-
sheet.

5. After making any final adjustments to the size, shape, or orientation of 
the WordArt text with the selection and rotation handles, click a cell 
somewhere outside of the text to deselect the graphic.
 
 Note that Excel automatically compresses the text to fill the shape and 
size of its text box. To put more space between the words and the char-
acters in each word, make the text box wider by dragging the sizing 
handle on either side of the text box.
When you click outside of the WordArt text, Excel deselects the graphic, 
and the Drawing Tools contextual tab disappears from the Ribbon. (If you 
ever want this tab to reappear, all you have to do is click somewhere on the 
WordArt text to select the graphic.)
Figure 2-9 shows the name of my company, Mind over Media, Inc., after cre-
ating the text in the WordArt style called Fill – Accent 2, Warm Matte Bevel,

Inserting SmartArt graphics
SmartArt graphics give you the ability to quickly and easily construct fancy 
graphical lists and diagrams in your worksheet. SmartArt lists and diagrams 
come in a wide array of configurations that include a variety of organiza-
tional charts and flow diagrams which enable you to add your own text to 
predefined graphic shapes.
To insert a SmartArt list or diagram into the worksheet, click the SmartArt 
button on the Insert tab or press Alt+NM. Excel then opens the Choose a 
SmartArt Graphic dialog box (shown in Figure 2-10) and then click a category 
in the navigation pane on the left followed by the list’s or diagram’s thumb-
nail in the center section before you click OK.
 
Figure 2-10: 
Select the 
SmartArt 
list or 
diagram to 
insert in the 
worksheet 
in this dialog 
box.
 
Excel then inserts the basic structure of the list or diagram into your work-
sheet along with a text pane (with “Type Your Text Here” on its title bar) 
containing a text outline to its immediate left. Here’s where you enter the 
text for the various parts of the list or diagram (as shown in Figure 2-11). At 
the same time, the Design tab of the SmartArt Tools contextual tab appears 
on the Ribbon with Layouts and Quick Styles galleries for the particular type 
of SmartArt list or diagram you originally selected.
Filling in the text for a new SmartArt graphic
To fill in the text for the first section of the new list or diagram in the outline 
in the text pane that already contains the insertion point, simply type in the 
text. Then, press the ↓ key or click the next list or diagram section to set the 
insertion point there.
 
Don’t press the Tab key or the Enter key to complete a text entry in the list 
or diagram as you naturally do in the regular worksheet — in a SmartArt list 
or diagram, pressing the Enter key inserts a new section of the list or dia-
gram (at the same level in hierarchical diagrams such as an org chart) and 
Tab either indents the level of the current section on the outline (in hierar-
chical diagrams) or it does nothing except beep at you.

When you finish entering the text for your new diagram, click the close 
button (with an X) in the upper left-hand corner of the text pane (you can 
always re-open the text pane if you need to edit any of the diagram’s text by 
clicking the button that appears in the middle of the left side of the selected 
list or diagram after you close the text pane).
 
If the style of the SmartArt list or diagram you select comes with more sec-
tions than you need, you can delete the unused graphics by clicking them to 
select them (indicated by the selection and rotation handles around it) and 
then pressing the Delete key.
Formatting a SmartArt graphic
After you close the text pane attached to your SmartArt list or diagram, 
you can still format its text and graphics. To format the text, select all the 
graphic objects in the SmartArt list or diagram that need the same type of 
text formatting — remember you can select several objects in the list or 
diagram by holding down Ctrl as you click them @md and then clicking the 
appropriate command buttons in the Font group on the Home tab of the 
Ribbon.

✦ Click the More button in the Layouts group and then click a thumbnail 
on the Layouts drop-down gallery to select an entirely new layout for 
your SmartArt list or diagram.
 
✦ Click the Change Colors button in the SmartArt Styles group and then 
click a thumbnail in the drop-down Theme Colors gallery to change the 
color scheme for the current layout.
 
✦ Click the More button in the SmartArt Styles group and then click a

Using Themes
Adding Screenshots of the Windows Desktop
The Screenshot button in the Illustrations group of the Insert tab enables 
you to capture Windows desktop graphics and insert them directly into your 
worksheet. Before clicking this button, you need to open up the other appli-
cation window whose document you want to capture as an Excel graphic 
object or set up the Windows’ desktop icons that you want to capture.
Then, switch back to the Excel 2010 program window, and click the 
Screenshot button on the Insert tab or press Alt+NSC. Excel then opens a 
Screenshot drop-down menu.
If you have application windows open on the desktop, a thumbnail of each 
window appears on this Screenshot drop-down menu under the heading 
Available Screen Shots. To capture one of the open window’s information 
as a graphic object in the current Excel worksheet, you simply click its 
thumbnail on this drop-down menu and Excel adds the window as a selected 
graphic in your sheet.
If you don’t want to capture any of the discrete application windows as 
graphics, you can use the Screen Clipping option that appears at the bottom 
of the Screenshot drop-down menu to select the section of the desktop to 
capture as a graphic. When you click the Screen Clipping option, Windows 
closes the Excel application window and displays the desktop with all of 
its windows and icons displayed but in a gauzy, hazy transparent mode. 
You then drag the black-cross pointer to select the section of the desktop 
you want captured as a worksheet graphic object (as you drag, Windows 
removes the gauzy effect from the area you select). When you release the 
mouse button, Windows immediately reopens the Excel program window 
with the section of the desktop added as a selected worksheet graphic.
Using Themes
With themes, Excel 2010 enables you to uniformly format all the graphics 
that you add to a worksheet. You can select a new theme for the active work-
sheet simply by clicking the thumbnail of the theme you want to use in the 
Themes drop-down gallery opened by clicking the Themes command button 
on the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab (or by pressing Alt+PTH).
 
Use Live Preview to see how the graphics you’ve added to your worksheet 
appear in the new theme before you click its thumbnail.
Excel Themes combines three default elements: the color scheme applied 
to the graphics, the font (body and heading) used in the graphics, and the 
graphic effects applied. If you prefer, you can change any or all of these 
three elements in the worksheet by clicking their individual command but-
tons in the Themes group at the start of the Page Layout tab:

568
Using Themes
 
✦ Colors to select a new color scheme by clicking its thumbnail on the 
drop-down palette — click Create New Theme Colors at the bottom of 
this palette to open the Create New Theme Colors dialog box where you 
can customize each element of the color scheme and save it with a new 
descriptive name.
 
✦ Fonts to select a new font by clicking its thumbnail on the drop-down 
list — click Create New Theme Fonts at the bottom of this list to open 
the Create New Theme Fonts dialog box, where you can customize the 
body and heading fonts for both Latin and East Asian text and save it 
with a new descriptive name.
 
✦ Effects to select a new set of graphics effects by clicking its thumbnail in 
the drop-down gallery.
 
To save your newly selected color scheme, font, and graphic effects as a 
custom theme that you can reuse in other workbooks, click the Themes 
command button and then click Save Current Theme at the bottom of the 
gallery to open the Save Current Theme dialog box. Edit the generic Theme1 
filename in the File Name text box (without deleting the .thmx filename 
extension) and then click the Save button. Excel then adds the custom 
theme to a Custom Themes section in the Themes drop-down gallery that 
you can apply to any active worksheet simply by clicking its thumbnail.

Maintaining Data Lists
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding what goes into making a data list
✓ Adding data to a data list
✓ Editing records in a data list
✓ Finding records in a data list
✓ Sorting records on values in a data list
✓ Sorting a list on font color, fill color, or cell icons

n addition to its considerable computational abilities, Excel is also very 
accomplished at maintaining vast collections of related data in what are 
referred to as database tables or data lists (which is a little more accurate). 
This chapter covers all the basic procedures for creating and then maintain-
ing different types of data lists in the Excel worksheet.
This basic information includes how to design the basic data list and then 
format it as a table so that you can add new data to the list without having 
to redefine it and can sort its data so that it’s arranged the way you like to 
see the information. For data lists that contain numerical data, you also find 
out how to subtotal and total the data. For information on how to find data 
in the data list and produce subsets of the list with just the data you need, 
refer to Book VI, Chapter 2.
Data List Basics
In Excel, a data list or database is a table of worksheet data that utilizes a 
special structure. Unlike the other types of data tables that you might create 
in an Excel spreadsheet, a data list uses only column headings (technically 
known as field names) to identify the different kinds of items that the data 
list tracks. Each column in the data list contains information for each item 
you track in the database, such as the client’s company name or telephone 
number (technically known as a field of the data list). Each row in the data 
list contains complete information about each entity that you track in the 
data list, such as ABC Corporation or National Industries (technically known 
as a record of the data list).

572
Data List Basics
After you’ve organized your data into a data list that follows this structure, 
you can then use a variety of commands on the Ribbon’s Data tab to main-
tain the data, as well as to reorder the information it contains. In data lists 
with numerical fields, you can also use the Subtotals command button to cal-
culate subtotals and totals in the list when a certain field changes.
Designing the basic data list
All you have to do to start a new data list in a worksheet is to enter the 
names of the fields that you want to track in the top row of the worksheet, 
enter the first record of data beneath, and then format the two rows of data 
as a table (see Book II, Chapter 1 for details). When entering the field names 
(as column headings), be sure each field name in the data list is unique and, 
whenever possible, keep the field name short. When naming fields, you can 
align the field name in the cell so that its text wraps to a new line by clicking 
the Wrap Text command button on the Ribbon’s Home tab after entering the 
name in its cell (Alt+HW). Also, you should not use numbers or formulas that 
return values as field names. (You can, however use formulas that return 
text, such as a formula that concatenates labels entered in different cells.)
When deciding on what fields you need to create, you need to think of how 
you’ll be using the data that you store in your data list. For example, in a 
client data list, you split the client’s name into separate title, first name, and 
last name fields if you intend to use this information in generating form let-
ters and mailing labels with your word processor. That way, you are able to 
address the person by his or her first name (as in Dear Jane) in the opening 
of the form letter you create, as well as by his or her full name and title (as in 
Dr. Jane Jackson) in the mailing label you generate.
Likewise, you split up the client’s address into separate street address, 
city, state, and ZIP code fields when you intend to use the client data list in 
generating form letters, and you also want to be able to sort the records in 
descending order by ZIP code and/or send letters only to clients located 
in the states of New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut. By keeping discrete 
pieces of information in separate fields, you are assured that you will be able 
to use that field in finding particular records and retrieving information from 
the data list, such as finding all the records where the state is California or 
the ZIP code is between 94105 and 95101.
To set up a new data list in a worksheet, you follow these steps:
 
1. Click the blank cell where you want to start the new data list and then 
enter the column headings (field names) that identify the different 
kinds of items you need to keep track of.
 
 After creating the fields of the data list by entering their headings, you’re 
ready to enter the first row of data.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Building and 
Maintaining Data Lists

Data List Basics
 
2. Make the first entries in the appropriate columns of the row immedi-
ately below the one containing the field names.
 
 These entries in the first row beneath the one with the field names con-
stitute the first record of the data list.
 
3. Click the Format as Table button on the Ribbon’s Home tab and then 
click a thumbnail of one of the table styles in the drop-down gallery.
 
 As soon as you click the Format as Table button, a marquee appears 
around all the cells in the new data list including the top row of field 
names. As soon as you click a table style in the drop-down gallery, the 
Format As Table dialog box appears listing the address of the cell range 
enclosed in the marquee in the Where Is the Data for Your Table text 
box, and the My Table Has Headers check box is selected.
 
4. Click the OK button to close the Format As Table dialog box.
Excel formats your new data list in the selected table format and adds 
AutoFilter (drop-down buttons) to each of the field names in the top row.
Figure 1-1 shows you a sample employee data list after formatting it as a 
table using Table Style Light 1. This data list begins in row 1 of this work-
sheet, which contains the names for the ten fields in this data list (ID No 
through Profit Sharing) all with AutoFilter buttons (thanks to the format-
ting as a table). Note that employees’ names are divided into separate First 
Name and Last Name fields in this list (columns B and C, respectively). 
Note too, that the first actual record of the data list is entered in row 2 of 
the worksheet, directly under the row with the field names. When entering 
your records for a new data list, you don’t skip rows but keep entering each 
record one above the other going down successive rows of the worksheet.
When you’re entering the row with the first data record, be sure to format all 
the cells the way you want the entries in that field to appear in all the sub-
sequent data records in the data list. For example, if you have a Salary field 
in the data list, and you want the salaries formatted with the Currency style 
number format without any decimal places, be sure to format the salary 
entry in the first record in this manner. If you have a ZIP Code field, format 
it with the Special Zip Code format or as Text so that Excel doesn’t drop 
the initial zeros from codes that begin with them such as 00234. That way, 
all subsequent records will pick up that same formatting for the salary field 
when you enter them with Excel’s data form.
Creating calculated fields
When creating a new data list, you can make full use of Excel’s calculating 
capabilities by defining fields whose entries are returned by formula rather 
than entered manually. The sample employee list introduced in Figure 1-1 
contains just such a calculated field (shown on the Formula bar) in cell I2 
that contains the first entry in the Years of Service field.

574
Data List Basics
 
Figure 1-1: 
Creating an 
employee 
data list 
with the 
row of field 
names and 
first data 
record.
 
The original formula for calculating years of service in cell I2 is as follows:
=YEAR(TODAY())–YEAR(H2)
This formula uses the YEAR date function to subtract the serial number 
of the year in which the employee was hired (entered into the Date Hired 
field) in cell H2 from the serial number of the current year (returned by 
the TODAY function). After entering and formatting this original formula in 
cell I2, the data form picks up this formula and automatically copies it and 
applies it to any new record you add to the data list.
Modifying the structure of the data list
You may find after creating your data list that you need to modify its struc-
ture by adding or deleting some fields. To add a new field, you select the 
column (by clicking the column letter) where you want the field inserted, 
and then click the Insert command button on the Ribbon’s Home tab to 
insert a new column. Replace the generic Column1 field name given to the 
new field in the top row with a descriptive name and then enter the entries 
for that field for each record in the data list. To delete an entire field from 
the data list (field name and entries), select its column, and then click the 
Delete command button on the Home tab.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Building and 
Maintaining Data Lists
575
Data List Basics
 
To avoid losing data or disturbing the layout of data located outside of the 
data list caused by adding or deleting its fields, don’t place any data tables 
or other entries in rows beneath the last row of the data list. In other words, 
always keep the rows used by the columns of the data list free for new 
records by locating all related data in columns to the right of the last field.
Add new records to a data list
After creating the field names and one record of the data list and format-
ting them as a table, you’re ready to start entering the rest of the records in 
subsequent rows of the list. The most direct way to do this is to press the 
Tab key when the cell cursor is in the last cell of the first record. Doing this 
causes Excel to add an extra row to the data list where you can enter the 
appropriate information for the next record.
 
When doing data entry directly in a data list table, press the Tab key to pro-
ceed to the next field in the new record rather than the → key. That way, 
when you complete the entry in the last field of the record, you automati-
cally extend the data list, add a new record, and position the cell cursor in 
the first field of that record — if you press → to complete the entry, Excel 
simply moves the cell cursor to the next cell outside of the data list table.
Adding the Form button to the Ribbon or the Quick Access toolbar
Instead of entering the records of a data list directly in the table, you can use 
Excel’s data form to make the entries. The only problem with using the data 
form is that its command button is not found on the Ribbon: The only way 
to access the data form is by adding its command button as a custom button 
on the Ribbon or to the Quick Access toolbar. To do this, you must follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button at the end of the 
toolbar and then click the More Commands option on its drop-down 
menu.
 
 Excel opens the Excel Options dialog box with the Quick Access Toolbar 
tab selected. If you want to add the Form button to the Ribbon instead 
of the Quick Access Toolbar, you need to click the Customize Ribbon 
option immediately above.
 
 The Form command button you want to add is only available when you 
choose Commands Not in the Ribbon on All Commands in the Choose 
Commands From drop-down list.
 
2. Click Commands Not in the Ribbon on the Choose Commands From 
drop-down list and then click the Form button to select it.

576
Data List Basics
 
 If you’re adding the Form button to the Quick Access toolbar, you can 
simply click the Add button to add it to the end of the toolbar. If, how-
ever, you’re adding the button to a custom Tab of the Ribbon, you must 
first create the tab and group in which to add the button. For example, 
to add the Form button to a Data group on a Misc custom tab, you click 
the New Tab button and then click the Rename button after selecting 
New Tab (Custom) and New Group (Custom) and naming them Misc and 
Data, respectively. Then, you click the Data (Custom) name under Misc 
(Custom) on the Main Tabs pane outline before clicking the Add button.
 
3. Click the Add button to add the Form button to the Quick Access tool-
bar or create the custom Ribbon Tab and Group and select its group 
name before clicking the Add button to add the Form button to the 
Ribbon.
 
4. Click OK to close the Excel Options dialog box and return to the work-
sheet with the data list.
Using the data form
The first time you click the custom Form button you’ve added to the Ribbon 
or Quick Access toolbar, Excel analyzes the row of field names and entries 
for the first record and creates a data form that lists the field names down 
the left side of the form, with the entries for the first record in the appropri-
ate text boxes next to them.
Figure 1-2 shows you the data form that Excel creates for the sample 
Employee data list shown earlier in Figure 1-1. As you can see in this figure, 
the data form consists of a dialog box (whose title bar contains the name of 
the current worksheet file, which just happens to be Employee Data List) 
that contains a vertical listing of each field defined for the data list.

data list to

When you click the custom Form button on the Quick Access toolbar to 
display the data form, Excel automatically displays the field entries for the 
first record entered (which just happens to be the only record in the list at

Data List Basics
this point). On the right side of the dialog box, the data form indicates the 
current record number out of the total number of records in the data list (1 
of 1 in this case). This part of the form also contains a number of command 
buttons that enable you to add a new record, find a particular record for 
editing, or delete a record from the data list.
When the data form is displayed in the active document, you can use the 
scroll bar to the right of the fields to move through the records in the data 
list, or you can use various direction keys. Table 1-1 summarizes the use 
of the scroll bar and these keys. For example, to move to the next record 
in the data list, you can press the ↓ or Enter key or click the scroll arrow 
at the bottom of the scroll bar. To move to the previous record in the data 
list (assuming that there’s more than one), you can press the ↑ key or 
Shift+Enter key or click the scroll arrow at the top of the scroll bar. To select 
a field in the current record for editing, you can click that field’s text box or 
press the Tab key (next field) or press Shift+Tab (previous field) until you 
select the field (and its current entry).

578
Data List Basics
Note that the data form does not allow you to select and edit calculated 
fields (such as the Years of Service field shown in Figure 1-2). Although 
calculated fields and their current entries are listed in the data form, the 
form doesn’t bother to provide a text box for the fields for making editing 
changes. To modify the contents of a calculated field, you would need to 
modify the original formula in the appropriate field in the first record and 
recopy the edited formula down to the other existing records in the list.
Adding new records with the data form
To add a new record to the data list, you can either move to the end of the 
data list (by dragging the scroll box to the very bottom of the scroll bar or 
by pressing Ctrl+↓ or Ctrl+PgDn) or simply click the New command button. 
Any way you do it, Excel displays a blank data form (marked New Record at 
the right side the dialog box), which you can then fill out. After entering the 
information for a field, press the Tab key to advance to the next field in the 
record (be careful not to press the Enter key because this inserts the new 
record into the data list).
When you’re making an entry in a new field, you can copy the entry from the 
same field in the previous record into the current field by pressing Ctrl+” 
(double quotation mark). You can use this keystroke shortcut, for example, 
to carry forward entries in the text box for the State field when you are 
entering a series of records that all use the same state.
When you’ve entered all the information you have for the new record, press 
the ↓ or Enter key or click the New button again. Excel then inserts the new 
record as the last record in the data list and displays a blank data form 
where you can enter the next record. When you finish adding records to the 
data list, press the Esc key or click the Close button to close the Data Form 
dialog box.
Editing records in the data form
The data form makes it easy to edit records in your data list. In a smaller 
data list, you can use the navigation keys or the scroll bar in the data form to 
locate the record that requires editing. In a larger data list, you can use the 
Criteria command button to quickly locate the record you need to change, 
as described in the next section.
When you’ve displayed the data form for the record that needs editing, you 
can then perform your editing changes by selecting the text boxes of the 
necessary fields and making your changes, just as you would edit the entry 
in its cell in the worksheet.

Data List Basics
Finding records with the data form
You can use the Criteria button in the data form to find the records in your 
data list that you need to edit (or delete as described in the next section). 
When you click the Criteria button in the data form, Excel clears all the field 
text boxes so that you can enter the criteria to search for. For example, 
assume that you need to edit Sherry Caulfield’s profit sharing status. You 
don’t have her paperwork in front of you, so you can’t look up her employee 
number. You do know, however, that she works in the Boston office and, 
although you don’t remember exactly how she spells her last name, you do 
know that it begins with a C instead of a K.
To locate her record, you can at least narrow the search down to all the 
records where the Location field contains Boston and the employee’s Last 
Name begins with the letter C (see Figure 1-3). To do this, you open the data 
form for the Employee data list, click the Criteria command button, and then 
enter the following in the Last Name field:
C*
Then, in the Location field, you enter
Boston
When entering the criteria for locating matching records in the data form, 
you can use the question mark (?) and the asterisk (*) wildcard characters, 
just as you do when using the Excel Find feature to locate cells with par-
ticular entries. (See Book II, Chapter 3, for a review of using these wildcard 
characters.)
 
Figure 1-3: 
Entering the 
criteria to 
find records 
where Last 
Name starts 
with C and 
Location is

When you click the Find Next button or press the Enter key, Excel locates 
the first record in the data list where the last name begins with the letter C 
and the location is Boston. This is William Cobb’s record, as shown in 
Figure 1-4. Then, to locate the next record that matches your criteria, 

580
Data List Basics
you click the Find Next button or press Enter, which brings you to Sherry 
Caulfield’s record, as shown in Figure 1-5. Having located Sherry’s record, 
you can then change her profit sharing status by selecting the Profit Sharing 
text box and replacing No with Yes. Excel inserts the editing change that you 
make in the record’s data form into the data list itself as soon as you close 
the Data Form dialog box by clicking the Close button.

When using the Criteria button in the data form to find records, you can use 
the following logical operators when entering search criteria in fields that 
use numbers or dates:
 
✦ Equal to (=): Finds records with the same text, value, or date you enter.
 
✦ Greater than (>): Finds records after the text characters (in the alpha-
bet) or the date, or larger than the value you enter.
 
✦ Greater than or equal to (>=): Finds records the same as the text char-
acters, date, or value you enter or after the characters (in the alphabet), 
after the date, or larger than the value.
 
✦ Less than (<): Finds records before the text characters (in the alphabet) 
or date or smaller than the value you enter.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Building and 
Maintaining Data Lists
581
Data List Basics
 
✦ Less than or equal to (<=): Finds records the same as the text charac-
ters, date, or value you enter or before the characters (in the alphabet) 
or the date, or larger than the value.
 
✦ Not equal to (<>): Finds records not the same as the text, value, or date 
you enter.
For example, to find all the records where the employee’s annual salary is 
$50,000, you can enter =50000 or simply 50000 in the Salary field text box. 
However, to find all the records for employees whose annual salaries are 
less than or equal to $35,000, you enter <=35000 in the Salary field text box. 
To find all the records for employees with salaries greater than $45,000, you 
would enter >45000 in the Salary field text box instead. If you wanted to 
find all of the records where the employees are female and make more than 
$35,000, you would enter F in the Gender field text box and >35000 in the 
Salary field text box in the same Criteria data form.
When specifying search criteria that fit a number of records, you may have 
to click the Find Next or Find Prev button several times to locate the record 
you want to work with. If no record fits the search criteria you enter in the 
Criteria data form, your computer will beep at you when you click the Find 
Next or Find Prev button.
To change your search criteria, select the appropriate text box(es) and 
delete the old criteria and then enter the new criteria. To switch back to 
the current record without using the search criteria you enter, click the 
Form button. (This button replaces the Criteria button as soon you click the 
Criteria button.)
Deleting records with the data form
In addition to adding and editing records with the data form, you can also 
delete them. To delete a record, you simply display its data form and then 
click the Delete button. Be very careful when deleting records, however, 
because you cannot restore the records you delete with Excel’s Undo 
feature. For this reason, Excel displays an alert dialog box whenever you 
choose the Delete button, indicating that the record displayed in the data 
form is about to be permanently deleted. To continue and remove the 
record, you need to choose OK or press Enter. To save the current record, 
press the Esc key or click the Cancel button instead.
 
Keep in mind that although you can use the Criteria data form to locate a 
group of records that you want to delete, you can remove only one record at 
a time with the Delete button.

582
Data List Basics
Eliminating records with duplicate fields
You can use Excel’s Eliminate Duplicates feature to quickly find and remove 
duplicate records from a list (or rows from a table). This is a great feature 
especially when you’re dealing with a really large data list in which several 
different people do the data entry and which should not have any duplicate 
records (such as client lists, personnel files, and the like).
To have Excel remove all duplicate records from a data list or table, you 
follow these simple steps:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in one of the cells of the data list or table.
 
2. Click the Remove Duplicates command button on the Ribbon’s Data 
tab or press Alt+AM.
 
 Excel selects all the cells in the data list while at the same time displaying 
the Remove Duplicates dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 1-6.
 
 When this dialog box first opens, Excel automatically selects all the 
fields in the list (by placing check marks in the check boxes in front of 
their names in the Columns list box). When all the fields are selected 
and you click OK in this dialog box, Excel deletes only complete dupli-
cates (in other words, copies) of the records in the list.
 
 If you want the program to remove records where there’s any duplica-
tion of entries in particular fields (such as the ID No field), you remove 
the check marks from all the columns except for those whose duplica-
tion are sufficient reason for deleting the entire record (as described in 
Step 3). Otherwise, you proceed directly to Step 4.
 
3. (Optional) Remove the check marks from all fields in the Columns list 
box except for those whose duplicates are reason for deleting the record.
 
 If only one or two fields out of many need to be selected in the Columns 
list box, click the Unselect All button to remove the check marks from 
all field check boxes and then individually click the fields that can’t have 
duplicate entries.
 
4. Click OK to have Excel close the Remove Duplicates dialog box and 
remove the duplicate records (rows) from the selected data list.

Sorting Data
Sorting Data
You can use the Sort & Filter Data command button on the Ribbon’s Home 
tab and the AutoFilter buttons on the field names to quickly sort data. You 
can sort the records in your data list by sorting its rows, and sort the fields 
in the data list by sorting its columns.
 
In sorting, you can specify either ascending or descending sort order for 
your data. When you specify ascending order (which is the default), Excel 
arranges text in A-to-Z order and values from smallest to largest. When you 
specify descending order, Excel reverses this order and arranges text in 
Z-to-A order and values range from largest to smallest. When sorting on a 
date field, keep in mind that ascending order puts the records in oldest to 
newest order, while descending order gives you the records in newest to 
oldest date order.
 
Keep in mind that, although sorting is most often applied to rearranging and 
maintaining data list records and fields, you can use the Sort & Filter com-
mand button to reorder data in any worksheet table, whether or not the 
table follows the strict data list structure.
Sorting records on a single field
When you only need to sort the data list on one particular field (such as the 
ID No, Last Name, or Location field), you simply click that field’s AutoFilter 
button and then click the appropriate sort option on its drop-down list:
 
✦ Sort A to Z or Sort Z to A in a text field
 
✦ Sort Smallest to Largest or Sort Largest to Smallest in a number field
 
✦ Sort Oldest to Newest or Sort Newest to Oldest in a date field
Excel then reorders all the records in the data list in accordance with the 
new ascending or descending order in the selected field. If you find that 
you’ve sorted the list in error, simply click the Undo button on the Quick 
Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z right away to return the list to its previous 
order.
 
Excel 2010 shows when a field has been used in sorting the data list by 
adding an up or down arrow to its filter button. An arrow pointing up indi-
cates that the ascending sort order was used and one pointing down indi-
cates that the descending sort order was used.

584
Sorting Data
Sorting records on multiple fields
When you need to sort a data list on more than one field, you use the Sort 
dialog box (shown in Figure 1-7). And you need to sort on more than one 
field when the first field contains duplicate values and you want to deter-
mine how the records with duplicates are arranged. (If you don’t specify 
another field to sort on, Excel just puts the records in the order in which you 
entered them.)
The best and most common example of when you need more than one field 
is when sorting a large database alphabetically in last-name order. Say that 
you have a database that contains several people with the last name Smith, 
Jones, or Zastrow (as is the case when you work at Zastrow and Sons). If 
you specify the Last Name field as the only field to sort on (using the default 
ascending order), all the duplicate Smiths, Joneses, and Zastrows are placed 
in the order in which their records were originally entered. To better sort 
these duplicates, you can specify the First Name field as the second field to 
sort on (again using the default ascending order), making the second field 
the tie-breaker, so that Ian Smith’s record precedes that of Sandra Smith, 
and Vladimir Zastrow’s record comes after that of Mikhail Zastrow.
 
Figure 1-7: 
Set up to

ally by

More about ascending and descending sort orders
When you use the ascending sort order on a 
field in a data list that contains many differ-
ent kinds of entries, Excel places numbers 
(from smallest to largest) before text entries 
(in alphabetical order), followed by any logi-
cal values (FALSE and TRUE), error values, 
and finally, blank cells. When you use the 
descending sort order, Excel arranges the dif-
ferent entries in reverse: numbers are still first, 
arranged from largest to smallest; text entries 
go from Z to A; and the TRUE logical value pre-
cedes the FALSE logical value.

Sorting Data
To sort records in a data list using the Sort dialog box, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in one of the cells in the data list table.
 
2. Click the Sort button in the Sort & Filter group on the Data tab or 
press Alt+ASS.
 
 Excel selects all the records of the database (without including the first 
row of field names) and opens the Sort dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-7. 
Note that you can also open the Sort dialog box by selecting the Custom 
Sort option on the Sort & Filter drop-down button’s menu or by pressing 
Alt+HSU.
 
3. Click the name of the field you first want the records sorted by in the 
Sort By drop-down list.
 
 If you want the records arranged in descending order, remember also to 
click the descending sort option (Z to A, Smallest to Largest, or Oldest to 
Newest) in the Order drop-down list to the right.
 
4. (Optional) If the first field contains duplicates and you want to specify 
how the records in this field are sorted, click the Add Level button 
to insert another sort level and select a second field to sort on in the 
Then By drop-down list and select either the ascending or descending 
option in its Order drop-down list to its right.
 
5. (Optional) If necessary, repeat Step 4, adding as many additional sort 
levels as required.
 
6. Click OK or press Enter.
 
 Excel closes the Sort dialog box and sorts the records in the data list 
using the sorting fields in the order of their levels in this dialog box. If 
you see that you sorted the database on the wrong fields or in the wrong 
order, click the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z 
to immediately restore the data list records to their previous order.
 
By default, when you perform a sort operation, Excel assumes that you’re 
sorting a data list that has a header row (with the field names) that is not 
to be reordered with the rest of the records in doing the sort. You can, 
however, use the Sort feature to sort a cell selection that doesn’t have such 
a header row. In that case, you need to specify the sorting keys by column 
letter, and you need to be sure to click the My Data Has Headers check box 
to remove its check mark in the Sort dialog box.
Also, the Sort dialog box contains an Options button that, when clicked, 
opens a Sort Options dialog box, which contains options for doing a case-
sensitive sort on fields that contain text. This dialog box also contains 
options for changing the orientation of the sort from the normal top-to-bot-
tom order to left-to-right order when you want to sort columns in a list.

Sorting Data
Figure 1-8 illustrates sorting the employee data list first in ascending order 
by location and then in descending order by salary. For this sort, the 
Location field is designated as the field (column) to sort on in the first level 
and the Salary field as the other field (column) as the second level. Also, to 
have the records within each location sorted from highest to lowest salary, I 
chose Largest to Smallest in the Order drop-down list to the right of the first 
Then By combo box.
After clicking OK in the Sort dialog box, you will note in Figure 1-8 how the 
records are now organized first in ascending order by the city listed in the 
Location field (Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and so on) and within each city in 
descending order by Salary (38,900, 32,200, 29,200, and so on).
Sometimes, you may need to sort on a whole bunch of fields to get the 
desired order. For example, suppose that you are working with a person-
nel data list like the one shown in Figure 1-9, and you want to organize the 
records in alphabetical order, first by department, then by supervisor, and 
finally by last name, first name, and middle name. To sort the records in this 
data list on these five fields, you have to define each of the columns as a 
separate level in the Sort dialog box as follows:
 
✦ First by Department field in A to Z order
 
✦ Then by Supervisor field in A to Z order
 
✦ Then by Last Name field in A to Z order
 
✦ Then by First Name field in A to Z order
 
✦ Then by Middle Name field in A to Z order

the records are now arranged in ascending order by department, then by 
supervisor within department, and finally by the last name, first name, and 
middle name under each supervisor.

Sorting the columns of a data list
You can use Excel’s column sorting capability to change the order of the 
fields in a data list without having to resort to cutting and pasting various 
columns. When you sort the fields in a data list, you add a row at the top 
of the list that you define as the primary sorting level. The cells in this row 
contain numbers (from 1 to the number of the last field in the data list) that 
indicate the new order of the fields.
Figures 1-11 and 1-12 illustrate how you can use column sorting to modify 
the field order of a data list in the sample Personnel data list. As you see in 
Figure 1-11, I began this process by inserting a new row (row 1) above the 
row with the field names for this data list. The cells in this row contain 
numbers that indicate the new field order. After the fields are sorted 
using the values in this row, the SSN field remains first (indicated by 1), 
the Department field becomes second (2), Supervisor field third (3), 
followed by First Name (4), Middle Name (5), Last Name (6), Title (7), 
and Salary (8).

Sorting Data
 
You can’t sort data you’ve formally formatted as a data table in this manner 
until you convert the table back into a normal cell range because the pro-
gram won’t recognize the row containing the column’s new order numbers 
as part of the table on which you can perform a sort. In this example, to get 
around the problem, you take the following steps:
 
1. Click a cell in the data table and then click the Convert to Range com-
mand button on the Design tab of the Table Tools contextual tab or 
press Alt+CTG.
 
 Excel displays an alert dialog box asking you if you want to convert the 
table to a range.
 
2. Click the Yes button in the alert dialog box to do the conversion.
 
3. Select all the records in the Personnel data list along with the top row 
containing the numbers on which to sort the columns of the list as the 
cell selection.
 
 In this case, you select the cell range A1:H20 as the cell selection.
 
4. Click the Sort command button on the Data tab (or press Alt+ASS).
 
 Excel opens the Sort dialog box. You can also open the Sort dialog box 
by clicking Custom Sort on the Sort & Filter button’s drop-down list or 
by pressing Alt+HSU.
 
5. Click the Options button in the Sort dialog box.
 
 Excel opens the Sort Options dialog box.
 
6. Click the Sort Left to Right option button and then click OK.
 
7. Click Row 1 in the Row drop-down list in the Sort dialog box.
 
 The Sort On drop-down list box should read Values and the Order drop-
down list box Smallest to Largest.
 
8. Click OK to sort the data list using the values in the top row of the cur-
rent cell selection.
 
 Excel sorts the columns of the Personnel data list according to the 
numerical order of the entries in the top row (which are now in a 1-to-8 
order). Now, you can get rid of the top row with these numbers.
 
9. Select the cell range A1:H1 and then click the Delete button on the 
Home tab.
 
 Excel deletes the row of numbers and pulls up the Personnel data list 
so that its row of field names is now in row 1 of the worksheet. Now, all 
that’s left to do is to reformat the Personnel data list as a table again so 
that Excel adds AutoFilter buttons to its field names and the program 
dynamically keeps track of the data list’s cell range as it expands and 
contracts.

10. Click the Format as Table command button on the Home tab (or press 
Alt+HT) and then click a table style from the Light, Medium, or Dark 
section of its gallery.
 
 Excel opens the Format As Table dialog box and places a marquee 
around all the cells in the data list.
 
11. Make sure that the My Table Has Headers check box has a check mark 
in it and that all the cells in the data list are included in the cell range 
displayed in the Where Is the Data for Your Table text box before you 
click OK.
Figure 1-12 shows the personnel data list after sorting its fields according 
to the values in the first row. After sorting the data list, you then delete this 
row and modify the widths of the columns to suit the new arrangement and 
reformat the list as a table before you save the worksheet.
 
When sorting the columns in a data list, you must remember to click 
the Options button and click the Sort Left to Right option button in the 
Orientation section of the Sort Options dialog box. Otherwise, Excel sorts 
your records instead of your columns, and in the process, the row of field 
names becomes sorted in with the other data records in your list!

Sorting a data list on font and 
fill colors and cell icons
Although you normally sort the records of a data list or rows of a table on 
the values (entries) contained in one or more columns of the list or table, 
Excel 2010 also enables you to sort on the font or fill color or cell icons that 
you assign to them as well. These colors and icons are assigned by using 
Conditional Formatting to mark those values in the columns of a data list or 
table that are within or outside certain parameters with a distinctive font 
or fill colors or cell icon (see “Conditional Formatting” in Book II, Chapter 2 
for details).
To sort a data list on a font color, fill color, or cell icon in a single field of 
the table, you click its AutoFilter button and then highlight the Sort by Color 
option on the drop-down menu. Excel then displays a continuation menu on 
which you click the font color, fill color, or cell icon to use in the sort:
 
✦ To sort the records so that those with a particular font color in the 
selected column — assigned with the Conditional Formatting Highlight 
Cell Rules or Top/Bottom Rules options — appear at the top of the data 
list, click its color swatch in the Sort by Font Color section on the con-
tinuation menu.
 
✦ To sort the records so that those with a particular fill color in the 
selected column — assigned with the Conditional Formatting Highlight 
Cell Rules, Top/Bottom Rules, Data Bars, or Color Scales options — 
appear at the top of the data list, click its color swatch in the Sort by 
Font Color section on the continuation menu.
 
✦ To sort the records so that those with a particular cell icon in the 
selected column — assigned with the Conditional Formatting Icon Sets 
options — appear at the top of the data list, click the icon in the Sort by 
Cell Icon section of the continuation menu.
You can also sort the data list on more than one color or cell icon in the Sort 
dialog box opened by clicking the Custom Sort option on the Sort & Filter 
button’s drop-down list on the Ribbon’s Home tab or on the Sort by Color 
continuation menu.
When you want to sort the records in a data list on more than one font or fill 
color or cell icon, you select the field with the color or icon in the Column 
drop-down list, click Font Color, Fill Color, or Cell Icon in the Sort On drop-
down list, and then click the color swatch or icon to use in the first level of 
the sort in the Order drop-down list.
If you need to add another sort level, you click the Add Level button and 
then repeat this procedure of selecting the field in the Column drop-down 
list, selecting the Font Color, Fill Color, or Cell Icon in the Sort On drop-down 
list, and selecting the specific color or icon in the Order drop-down list. 

592
Subtotaling Data
When you finish defining all the levels for the sort, click OK to have Excel go 
ahead and sort the list’s records.
 
You can sort the records in the data list order by all the fill colors or cell 
icons assigned by applying the Conditional Formatting Color Scales and 
Cell Icons options. For each of three or five sorting levels you define in the 
Sort dialog box, the name of the field in the Column drop-down list button 
remains the same in all levels along with the Fill Color or Cell Icon option in 
the Sort On drop-down list button. Only the actual color or icon selected in 
the Order drop-down list button changes, reflecting the order in which you 
want to see the records appear in the sorted data list.
Subtotaling Data
You can use Excel’s Subtotals feature to subtotal data in a sorted list. To 
subtotal a data list, you first sort the list on the field for which you want the 
subtotals, and then you designate the field that contains the values you want 
summed — these don’t have to be the same fields in the data list.
When you use the Subtotals feature, you aren’t restricted to having the 
values in the designated field added together with the SUM function. You 
can instead have Excel return the number of entries with the COUNT func-
tion, the average of the entries with the AVERAGE function, the highest entry 
with the MAXIMUM function, the lowest entry with the MINIMUM function, 
or even the product of the entries with the PRODUCT function.
 
To subtotal the salaries within each department in my example Employee 
Data list, first sort the list in A-to-Z order on the Dept column because Excel 
is to create a new subtotal at each change in the department entries within 
the list (Accounting, Administration, Engineering, and so on).
 
Excel does not allow you to subtotal a data list formatted as a table. Before 
you can use the Subtotal command button, you must first convert your table 
into a normal range of cells. To do this, click a cell in the table and then click 
the Design tab on the Table Tools Contextual tab on the Ribbon. Finally, 
click the Convert to Range command button in the Tools group followed 
by the Yes button in the alert dialog box asking you to confirm this action. 
Excel then removes the filter buttons from the columns at the top of the data 
list while still retaining the original table formatting.
Figures 1-13 and 1-14 illustrate how easy it is to use the Subtotals feature to 
obtain totals in a data list. In Figure 1-13, I sorted the sample Employee data 
list first by the Dept field in ascending order and then by the Salary field 
in descending order. I then clicked the Subtotal command button on the 
Ribbon’s Data tab to open the Subtotal dialog box shown in Figure 1-13.

Book VI
Chapter 1

Subtotaling Data
Here, I selected the Dept field as the field for which the subtotals are to be 
calculated in the At Each Change In drop-down list box, Sum as the function 
to use in the Use Function drop-down list box, and the Salary check box as 
the field whose values are to be summed in the Add Subtotal To list box.
Figure 1-14 shows the results I obtained after clicking OK in the Subtotal 
dialog box. Here, you see the bottom of the data list showing the salary 
subtotals for the Administration, Engineering, Human Resources, and 
Information Services departments along with the grand total of the salaries 
for all the departments. The grand total is displayed at the bottom of the 
data list because I left the Summary below Data check box selected in the 
Subtotal dialog box — if I hadn’t wanted a grand total, I would have removed 
the check mark from this check box.

594
Subtotaling Data
As you can see in Figure 1-14, when you use the Subtotals command, Excel 
outlines the data at the same time that it adds the rows with the departmen-
tal salary totals and the grand total. This means that you can collapse the 
data list down to just its departmental subtotal rows or even just the grand 
total row simply by collapsing the outline down to the second or first level. 
(Remember that you can toggle between showing and hiding the outline 
symbols at the left edge of the data list by pressing Ctrl+8.)
 
In a large data list, you may want Excel to insert page breaks (often referred 
to as a break) every time data changes in the field on which the list is being 
subtotaled (that is, the field designated in the At Each Change In drop-down 
list box). To do this, you simply click the Page Break between Groups check 
box in the Subtotal dialog box to put a check mark in it before you click OK 
to subtotal the list.

t’s one thing to set up a data list and load it with tons of data and quite 
another to get just the information that you need out of the list. How you 
go about extracting the data that’s important to you is the subject of this 
chapter. The procedure for specifying the data that you want displayed in 
an Excel data list is called filtering the data list or database. The procedure 
for extracting only the data that you want from the database or data list is 
called querying the database.
In addition to filtering and querying the data in your list, this chapter 
explains how you can use Excel’s Database functions to perform calcula-
tions on particular numerical fields for only the records that meet the crite-
ria that you specify. These calculations can include getting totals (DSUM), 
averages (DAVERAGE), the count of the records (DCOUNT and DCOUNTA), 
and the like.
Finally, this chapter introduces you to querying external databases in order 
to bring some of their data into the more familiar worksheet setting. These 
external databases that you query in Excel can be in other Windows data-
base programs, such as Microsoft Access or dBASE, or in even more sophis-
ticated, non-Windows database management systems, such as IBM’s dB2 or 
Oracle Corporation’s Oracle DBMS.

Data List Filtering 101
Data List Filtering 101
If you ever have the good fortune to attend my class on database manage-
ment, you’ll hear my spiel on the difference between data and information 
in the tables in a database (or data list, in Excel-speak). In case you’re the 
least little bit interested, it goes like this: A data list or the tables that make 
up a database consist of a vast quantity of raw data, which simply represent 
all the stuff that everybody in the company wants stored on a given subject 
(employees, sales, clients, you name it). For example, suppose that you keep 
a data list on the sales transactions made by your customers. This data list 
can very well track such stuff as the customers’ identification numbers, 
names, addresses, telephone numbers, whether they have a charge account 
with the store, the maximum amount that they can charge, the purchases 
that they’ve made (including the dates and amounts), and whether their 
accounts are due (or overdue).
However, this vast quantity of data stored in the customer data list is not to 
be confused with the information that particular people in the office want 
out of the data. For example, suppose that you’re working in the marketing 
department and you’re about to introduce a line of expensive household 
items that you want to advertise. You want to limit the advertising to those 
customers who have a charge account with the store and have purchased 
at least $5,000 of merchandise in the last six months. Use the data provided 
in the data list to supply the information to weed out the customers that you 
need from the list.
On the other hand, suppose that you work in the accounting department and 
you need to send out nasty notices to all the customers who have charge 
accounts that are more than 90 days past due. In this case, you want only 
the data identifying those customers whose accounts are overdue. You 
couldn’t care less about what was actually purchased. All you care about is 
reaching these folks and convincing them to pay up. You again use the data 
provided in the data list to supply the information to weed out the custom-
ers that you need from the list.
From these simple examples, it should be clear that the data that supply 
information to one group in the company at a particular time are often not 
the same data that supply information to another group. In other words, for 
most people, the data list dispenses information only when you are able to 
filter out the stuff that you currently don’t want to see, and leaves behind 
just the stuff that interests you.
Filtering Data
Filtering the data list to leave behind only the information that you want 
to work with is exactly the procedure that you follow in Excel. At the most 

Book VI
Chapter 2
Filtering and 
Querying a Data List
597
Filtering Data
basic level, you use the AutoFilter feature to temporarily hide the display of 
unwanted records and leave behind only the records that you want to see. 
Much of the time, the capabilities of the AutoFilter feature are all that you 
need, especially when your main concern is simply displaying just the infor-
mation of interest in the data list.
You will encounter situations, however, in which the AutoFilter feature is not 
sufficient, and you must do what Microsoft refers to as advanced filtering in 
your data list. You need to use advanced filtering to filter the data list when 
you use computed criteria (such as when you want to see all the records 
where the entry in the Sales column is twice the amount in the Owed 
column) and when you need to save a copy of the filtered data in a different 
part of the worksheet (Excel’s version of querying the data in a data list).
Using AutoFilter
Excel’s AutoFilter feature makes filtering out unwanted data in a data list as 
easy as clicking the AutoFilter button on the column on which you want to 
filter the data and then clicking the appropriate filtering criteria on that col-
umn’s drop-down menu.
 
If you open a worksheet with a data list and you don’t find AutoFilter buttons 
attached to each of the field names at the top of the list, you can display 
them simply by positioning the cell cursor in one of the cells with the field 
names and then clicking the Filter command button on the Ribbon’s Data tab 
or pressing Alt+AT.
The filter options on a column’s AutoFilter drop-down menu depend on the 
type of entries in the field. On the drop-down menu in a column that con-
tains only date entries, the menu contains a Date Filters option to which 
a submenu of the actual filters is attached. On the drop-down menu in a 
column that contains only numeric entries (besides dates) or a mixture of 
dates with other types of numeric entries, the menu contains a Number 
Filters option. On the drop-down menu in a column that contains only text 
entries or a mixture of text, date, and other numeric entries, the menu con-
tains a Text Filters option.
Doing basic filtering by selecting specific field entries
In addition to the Date Filters, Text Filters, or Number Filters options 
(depending on the type of field), the AutoFilter drop-down menu for each 
field in the data list contains a list box with a complete listing of all entries 
made in that column, each with its own check box. At the most basic level, 
you can filter the data list by clearing the check box for all the entries whose 
records you don’t want to see in the list.

598
Filtering Data
 
This kind of basic filtering works best in fields such as City, State, or 
Country, which contain many duplicates, so you can see a subset of the data 
list that contains only the cities, states, or countries you want to work with 
at the time.
The easiest way to perform this basic type of filtering on a field is to first 
click the check box in front of the (Select All) option at the top of the field’s 
list box to clear the check boxes, and then click each of the check boxes con-
taining the entries for the records you do want displayed in the filtered data 
list. After you finish selecting the check boxes for all the entries you want to 
keep, you click OK to close the AutoFilter drop-down menu.
Excel then hides rows in the data list for all records except for those that 
contain the entries you just selected. The program also lets you know which 
field or fields have been used in the filtering operation by adding a cone 
filter icon to the column’s AutoFilter button. To restore all the records to 
the data list, you can remove the filtering by clicking the Clear command 
button in the Sort & Filter group of the Data tab of the Ribbon or by pressing 
Alt+AC.
When doing this basic kind of list filtering, you can select specific entries 
from more than one field in this list. Figure 2-1 illustrates this kind of situ-
ation. Here, I want only the employees in the company who work in the 
Engineering and Information Services departments in the Chicago and 
Seattle offices. To do this, I selected only the Engineering and Information 
Services entries in the list box on the Dept field’s AutoFilter drop-down 
menu and only the Chicago and Seattle entries in the list box on the Location 
field’s AutoFilter drop-down menu.
As you can see in Figure 2-1, after filtering the Employee data list so that only 
the records for employees in either the Engineering or Information Services 
department in either the Chicago or Seattle office locations are listed, Excel 
adds the cone filter icon to the AutoFilter buttons on both the Dept and 
Location fields in the top row, indicating that the list is filtered using criteria 
involving both fields.
 
Keep in mind that after filtering the data list in this manner, you can then 
copy remaining records that make up the desired subset of the data list to a 
new area in the same worksheet or to a new sheet in the workbook. You can 
then sort the data (by adding AutoFilter buttons with the Filter command 
button on the Data tab), chart the data (see Book V, Chapter 1), analyze the 
data (see “Using the Database Functions” later in this chapter), or summa-
rize the data in a pivot table (see Book VII, Chapter 2).

month is displayed in the palette. To select a date in a later month, click the 
Next button (the one with the triangle pointing right) until its month is dis-
played in the palette.
Using the Number Filters options
The AutoFilter drop-down menu for a field that contains only number entries 
besides dates or a combination of dates and other numeric entries contains 
a Number Filters option that when you click or highlight displays its sub-
menu containing the following options:
 
✦ Equals: Opens the Custom AutoFilter dialog box with the Equals opera-
tor selected in the first condition.
 
✦ Does Not Equal: Opens the Custom AutoFilter dialog box with the Does 
Not Equal operator selected in the first condition.
 
✦ Greater Than: Opens the Custom AutoFilter dialog box with the Is 
Greater Than operator selected in the first condition.

✦ Greater Than or Equal To: Opens the Custom AutoFilter dialog box with 
the Is Greater Than or Equal To operator selected in the first condition.
 
✦ Less Than: Opens the Custom AutoFilter dialog box with the Is Less 
Than operator selected in the first condition.
 
✦ Less Than or Equal To: Opens the Custom AutoFilter dialog box with 
the Is Less Than or Equal to operator selected in the first condition.
 
✦ Between: Opens the Custom AutoFilter dialog box with the Is Greater 
Than or Equal To operator selected in the first condition and the Is Less 
Than or Equal To operator selected in the second AND condition.
 
✦ Top 10: Opens the Top 10 AutoFilter dialog box so that you can filter the 
list to just the ten or so top or bottom values or percentages in the field 
(see “Making it to the Top Ten!” that follows in this chapter for details).
 
✦ Above Average: Filters the data list to display only records where the 
values in the field are greater than the average of the values in this field.
 
✦ Below Average: Filters the data list to display only records where the 
values in the field are less than the average of the values in this field.
 
✦ Custom Filter: Opens the Custom AutoFilter dialog box where you can 
select your own criteria for more complex AND or OR conditions. 
Making it to the Top Ten!
The Top Ten option on the Number Filters option’s submenu enables you to 
filter out all records except those whose entries in that field are at the top 
or bottom of the list by a certain number (10 by default) or in a certain top 
or bottom percent (10 by default). Of course, you can only use the Top Ten 
item in numerical fields and date fields; this kind of filtering doesn’t make 
any sense when you’re dealing with entries in a text field.
When you click the Top Ten option on the Number Filters option’s submenu, 
Excel opens the Top 10 AutoFilter dialog box where you can specify your fil-
tering criteria. By default, the Top 10 AutoFilter dialog box is set to filter out 
all records except those whose entries are among the top ten items in the 
field by selecting Top in the drop-down list box on the left, 10 in the middle 
combo box, and Items in the drop-down list box on the right. If you want 
to use these default criteria, you simply click OK in the Top 10 AutoFilter 
dialog box.
Figure 2-2 shows you the sample employee data list after using Top 10 
AutoFilter to display only the records with the top ten salaries in the data list.
You can also change the filtering criteria in the Top 10 AutoFilter dialog box 
before you filter the data. You can choose between Top and Bottom in the 
leftmost drop-down list box and between Items and Percent in the rightmost 
one. You can also change the number in the middle combo box by clicking it 
and entering a new value or using the spinner buttons to select one.

Filtering a data list on a field’s font and fill colors or cell icons
Just as you can sort a data list using the font or fill color or cell icons that 
you’ve assigned with Conditional Formatting to values in the field that are 
within or outside of certain parameters (see “Conditional Formatting” in 
Book II, Chapter 2 for details), you can also filter the list.
To filter a data list on a font color, fill color, or cell icon used in a field, you 
click its AutoFilter button and then highlight the Filter by Color option on 
the drop-down menu. Excel then displays a submenu on which you click the 
font color, fill color, or cell icon to use in the sort:
 
✦ To filter the data list so that only the records with a particular font 
color in the selected field — assigned with the Conditional Formatting 
Highlight Cell Rules or Top/Bottom Rules options — appear in the list, 
click its color swatch in the Filter by Font Color submenu.
 
✦ To filter the data list so that only the records with a particular fill 
color in the selected field — assigned with the Conditional Formatting 
Highlight Cell Rules, Top/Bottom Rules, Data Bars, or Color Scales 
options — appear in the list, click its color swatch in the Filter by Font 
Color submenu.
 
✦ To filter the data list so that only the records with a particular cell icon 
in the selected field — assigned with the Conditional Formatting Icon 
Sets options — appear in the list, click the icon in the Filter by Cell Icon 
submenu.

Custom AutoFilter at your service
You can click the Custom Filter option on a field’s Text Filters, Date Filters, 
or Number Filters continuation menu to open the Custom AutoFilter dialog 
box, where you can specify your own filtering criteria by using conditions 
with the AND and OR logical operators (called AND and OR conditions for 
short). When you click the Custom Filter option, Excel opens the Custom 
AutoFilter dialog box, similar to the one shown in Figure 2-3.
 
Figure 2-3:

Here, you select the type of operator to use in evaluating the first and 
second conditions in the top and bottom drop-down list boxes and the 
values to be evaluated in the first and second conditions in the associated 
combo boxes. You also specify the type of relationship between the two con-
ditions with the And or Or option button (the And option button is selected 
by default).
When selecting the operator for the first and second condition in the left-
most drop-down list boxes at the top and bottom of the Custom AutoFilter 
dialog box, you have the following choices, depending on the types of 
entries in the selected field:
 
✦ Equals: Matches records where the entry in the field is identical to the 
text, date, or number you enter in the associated combo box.
 
✦ Does Not Equal: Matches records where the entry in the field is any-
thing other than the text, date, or number you enter in the associated 
combo box.
 
✦ Is After: Matches records where the entry in the date field comes after 
the date you enter or select in the associated combo box.
 
✦ Is After or Equal To: Matches records where the entry in the date field 
comes after or is the same as the date you enter or select in the associ-
ated combo box.
 
✦ Is Before: Matches records where the entry in the date field precedes 
the date you enter or select in the associated combo box.

✦ Is Before or Equal To: Matches records where the entry in the date field 
precedes or is the same as the date you enter or select in the associated 
combo box.
 
✦ Is Greater Than: Matches records where the entry in the field follows 
the text in the alphabet, comes after the date, or is larger than the 
number you enter in the associated combo box.
 
✦ Is Greater Than or Equal To: Matches records where the entry in the 
field follows the text in the alphabet or is identical, the date comes after 
or is identical, or the number is larger than or equal to the one you enter 
in the associated combo box.
 
✦ Is Less Than: Matches records where the entry in the field comes before 
the text in the alphabet, comes before the date, or is less than the 
number you enter in the associated combo box.
 
✦ Is Less Than or Equal To: Matches records where the entry in the field 
comes before the text in the alphabet or is identical, the date comes 
before or is identical, or the number is less than or equal to the one you 
enter in the associated combo box.
 
✦ Begins With: Matches records where the entry in the field starts with 
the text, the part of the date, or the number you enter in the associated 
combo box.
 
✦ Does Not Begin With: Matches records where the entry in the field 
starts with anything other than the text, the part of the date, or the 
number you enter in the associated combo box.
 
✦ Ends With: Matches records where the entry in the field ends with the 
text, the part of the date, or the number you enter in the associated 
combo box.
 
✦ Does Not End With: Matches records where the entry in the field ends 
with anything other than the text, the part of the date, or the number 
you enter in the associated combo box.
 
✦ Contains: Matches records where the entry in the field contains the text, 
the part of the date, or the number you enter in the associated combo 
box.
 
✦ Does Not Contain: Matches records where the entry in the field contains 
anything other than the text, the part of the date, or the number you 
enter in the associated combo box.
 
Note that you can use the Begins With, Ends With, and Contains operators 
and their negative counterparts when filtering a text field — you can also use 
the question mark (?) and asterisk (*) wildcard characters when entering the 
values for use with these operators (the question mark wildcard stands for 
individual characters and the asterisk stands for one or more characters). You 
use the other logical operators when dealing with numeric and date fields.

606
Filtering Data
When specifying the values to evaluate in the associated combo boxes on 
the right side of the Custom AutoFilter dialog box, you can type in the text, 
number, or date, or you can select an existing field entry by clicking the 
box’s drop-down list button and then clicking the entry on the drop-down 
menu. In date fields, you can select the dates directly from the date drop-
down palette opened by clicking the box’s Date Picker button (the one with 
the calendar icon).
Figure 2-3 illustrates setting up filtering criteria in the Custom AutoFilter 
dialog box that selects records whose Salary values fall within two separate 
ranges of values. In this example, I’m using an OR condition to filter out all 
records where the salaries fall below $35,000 or are greater than $75,000 by 
entering the following complex condition:
Salary Is Greater Than 75000 OR Is Less Than 35000
Using the Advanced Filter
When you use advanced filtering, you don’t use the field’s AutoFilter buttons 
and associated drop-down menu options. Instead, you create a so-called 
Criteria Range somewhere on the worksheet containing the data list to be 
filtered before opening the Advanced Filter dialog box.
If you use the Advanced Filter feature to do a query, you extract copies of 
the records that match your criteria by creating a subset of the data list. You 
can locate the Criteria Range in the top rows of columns to the right of the 
data list and then specify the Copy To range underneath the Criteria Range, 
similar to the arrangement shown in Figure 2-4.
To create a Criteria Range, you copy the names of the fields in the data list 
to a new part of the worksheet and then enter the values (text, numbers, or 
formulas) that are to be used as the criteria in filtering the list in rows under-
neath. When setting up the criteria for filtering the data list, you can create 
either comparison criteria or calculated criteria.
After you’ve set up your criteria range with all the field names and the cri-
teria that you want used, you click the Advanced command button on the 
Ribbon’s Data tab (or press Alt+AQ) to open the Advanced Filter dialog box 
similar to the one shown in Figure 2-4. Here, you specify whether you just 
want to filter the records in the list (by hiding the rows of all those that don’t 
meet your criteria) or you want to copy the records that meet your criteria 
to a new area in the worksheet (by creating a subset of the data list).
To just filter the data in the list, leave the Filter the List, In Place option button 
selected. To query the list and copy the data to a new place in the same work-
sheet (note that the Advanced Filter feature doesn’t let you copy the data to 

Book VI
Chapter 2
Filtering and 
Querying a Data List
607
Filtering Data
another sheet or workbook), you click the Copy to Another Location option 
button. When you click this option button, the Copy To text box becomes 
available, along with the List Range and Criteria Range text boxes.
To specify the data list that contains the data that you want to filter or 
query, click the List Range text box and then enter the address of the cell 
range or select it directly in the worksheet by dragging through its cells. To 
specify the range that contains a copy of the field names along with the cri-
teria entered under the appropriate fields, you click the Criteria Range text 
box and then enter the range address of this cell range or select it directly 
in the worksheet by dragging through its cells. When selecting this range, 
be sure that you include all the rows that contain the values that you want 
evaluated in the filter or query.
If you’re querying the data list by copying the records that meet your crite-
ria to a new part of the worksheet (indicated by clicking the Copy to Another 
Location option button), you also click the Copy To text box and then enter 
the address of the cell that is to form the upper-left corner of the copied and 
filtered records or click this cell directly in the worksheet.
After specifying whether to filter or query the data and designating the ranges 
to be used in this operation, click OK to have Excel apply the criteria that 
you’ve specified in the Criteria Range in either filtering or copying the records.

608
Filtering Data
After filtering a data list, you may feel that you haven’t received the expected 
results — for example, no records are listed under the field names that you 
thought should have several. You can bring back all the records in the list 
by clicking the Clear command button on the Data tab of the Ribbon or by 
pressing Alt+AC. Now you can fiddle with the criteria in the Criteria Range 
text box and try the whole advanced filtering thing all over again.
Specifying comparison criteria
Entering selection criteria in the Criteria Range for advanced filtering is 
very similar to entering criteria in the data form after selecting the Criteria 
button. However, you need to be aware of some differences. For example, 
if you are searching for the last name Paul and enter the label Paul in the 
criteria range under the cell containing the field name Last Name, Excel will 
match any last name that begins with P-a-u-l such as Pauley, Paulson, and so 
on. To avoid having Excel match any other last name beside Paul, you would 
have to enter a formula in the cell below the one with the Last Name field 
name, as in
=”Paul”
When entering criteria for advanced filtering, you can also use the question 
mark (?) or the asterisk (*) wildcard character in your selection criteria just 
like you do when using the data form to find records. If, for example, you 
enter J*n under the cell with the First Name field name, Excel will consider 
any characters between J and n in the First Name field to be a match includ-
ing Joan, Jon, or John as well as Jane or Joanna. To restrict the matches to 
just those names with characters between J and n and to prevent matches 
with names that have trailing characters, you need to enter the following for-
mula in the cell:
=”J*n”
When you use a selection formula like this, Excel will match names such as 
Joan, Jon, and John but not names such as Jane or Joanna that have a char-
acter after the n.
To filter out duplicate rows or records that 
match your criteria, select the Unique Records 
Only check box in the Advanced Filter dialog 
box before you start the filtering operation. You 
can remove the display of all duplicate records 
from a data list by selecting this check box and 
removing all cell references from the Criteria 
Range text box before you click OK or press 
Enter.
Only the unique need apply!

When setting up selection criteria, you can also use the other comparative 
operators, including >, >=, <, <=, and <>, in the selection criteria. See Table 
2-1 for descriptions and examples of usage in selection criteria for each of 
these logical operators.

To find all the records where a particular field is blank in the database, enter 
= and press the spacebar to enter a space in the cell beneath the appropri-
ate field name. To find all the records where a particular field is not blank 
in the database, enter <> and press the spacebar to enter a space in the cell 
beneath the appropriate field name.
Setting up logical AND and logical OR conditions
When you enter two or more criteria in the same row beneath different field 
names in the Criteria Range, Excel treats the criteria as a logical AND condi-
tion and selects only those records that meet both of the criteria. Figure 2-5 
shows an example of the results of a query that uses an AND condition. Here, 
Excel has copied only those records where the location is Boston and the 
date hired is before January 1, 2000 because both the criteria Boston and 
<1/1/00 are placed in the same row (row 2) under their respective field names, 
Location and Date Hired.

When you enter two or more criteria in different rows of the Criteria Range, 
Excel treats the criteria as a logical OR and selects records that meet any 
one of the criteria they contain. Figure 2-6 shows you an example of the 
results of a query using an OR condition. In this example, Excel has copied 
records where the location is either Boston or San Francisco because Boston 
is entered under the Location field name in the second row (row 2) of the 
Criteria Range above San Francisco entered in the third row (row 3).
When creating OR conditions, you need to remember to redefine the Criteria 
Range to include all the rows that contain criteria, which in this case is 
the cell range L2:U3 (if you forget, Excel uses only the criteria in the rows 
included in the Criteria range).
When setting up your criteria, you can combine logical AND and logical OR 
conditions (again, assuming that you expand the Criteria Range sufficiently 
to include all the rows containing criteria). For example, if you enter Boston 
in cell R2 (under Location) and <1/1/00 in cell S2 (under Date Hired) in 
row 2 and enter San Francisco in cell R3 and then repeat the query, Excel 
copies the records where the location is Boston and the date hired is before 
January 1, 2000, as well as the records where the location is San Francisco 
(regardless of the date hired).

Setting up Calculated criteria
You can use calculated criteria when filtering or querying your data list. All 
you need to do is enter a logical formula that Excel can evaluate as either 
TRUE or FALSE in the Criteria Range under a name that is not used as a field 
name in the data list (I repeat, is not a field name in the data list). Calculated 
criteria enable you to filter or query records based on a comparison of 
entries in a particular field with entries in other fields of the list or based 
on a comparison with entries in the worksheet that lie outside the data list 
itself.
Figure 2-7 shows an example of using a calculated criterion that compares 
values in a field to a calculated value that isn’t actually entered in the data 
list. Here, you want to perform a query that copies all the records from the 
Employee data list where the employee’s salary is above the average salary. 
In this figure, cell V2 contains the formula that uses the AVERAGE function 
to compute average employee salary and then compares the first salary 
entry in cell F2 of the data list to that average with the following formula:
=F2>AVERAGE($F$2:$F$33)
Note that this logical formula is placed under the label Calculated Criteria 
in cell V2, which has been added to the end of the Criteria Range. Cell F2 

612
Filtering Data
is the first cell in the data list that contains a salary entry. The cell range, 
$F$2:$F$33, used as the argument of the AVERAGE function, is the range in 
the Salary field that contains all the salary entries.
To use this calculated criterion, you must remember to place the logical 
formula under a name that isn’t used as a field name in the data list itself. (In 
this example, the label Calculated Criteria does not appear anywhere in the 
row of field names.) You must include this label and formula in the Criteria 
Range (for this query example, the Criteria Range is defined as the cell range 
L2:V2).
When you then perform the query by using the Advanced Filter feature, 
Excel applies this calculated criterion to every record in the database. Excel 
does this by adjusting the first Salary field cell reference F2 (entered as a 
relative reference) as the program examines the rest of the records below. 
Note, however, that the range reference specified as the argument of the 
AVERAGE function is entered as an absolute reference ($F$2:$F$33) in the 
criterion formula so that Excel won’t adjust this reference but compare the 
Salary entry for each record to AVERAGE computed for this entire range 
(which just happens to be 40,161).
 
When entering formulas for calculated criteria that compare values outside 
the data list to values in a particular field, you should always reference the 
cell containing the very first entry for that field in order to ensure that Excel 
applies your criteria to every record in the data list.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Filtering and 
Querying a Data List
613
Using the Database Functions
You can also set up calculated criteria that compare entries in one or more 
fields to other entries in the data list. For example, to extract the records 
where the Years of Service entry is at least two years greater than the record 
above it (assuming that you have sorted the data list in ascending order by 
years of service), you would enter the following logical formula under the 
cell labeled Calculated Criteria:
=I3>I2+2
Most often, when referencing cells within the data list itself, you want to 
leave the cell references relative so that they can be adjusted, because each 
record is examined, and the references to the cells outside the database are 
absolute so that these won’t be changed when making the comparison with 
the rest of the records.
When you enter the logical formula for a calculated criterion, Excel returns 
the logical value TRUE or FALSE. This logical value applies to the field entry 
for the first record in the data list that you refer to in the logical formula. By 
inspecting this field entry in the database and seeing if it does, indeed, meet 
your intended selection criteria, you can usually tell whether your logical 
formula is correct.
Using the AND and OR functions in calculated criteria
You can also use Excel’s AND, OR, and NOT functions with the logical opera-
tors in calculated criteria to find records that fall within a range. For exam-
ple, to find all the records in the employee database where the salaries range 
between $55,000 and $75,000, you would enter the following logical formula 
with the AND function under the cell with the label Calculated Criteria:
=AND(F2>=55000,F2<=75000)
To find all the records in the Employee data list where the salary is either 
below $29,000 or above $45,000, you would enter the following logical for-
mula with the OR function under the cell with the label Calculated Criteria:
=OR(F2<29000,F2>45000)
Using the Database Functions
Excel includes a number of database functions that you can use to calculate 
statistics, such as the total, average, maximum, minimum, and count in a 
particular field of the data list only when the criteria that you specify are 
met. For example, you could use the DSUM function in the sample Employee 
data list to compute the sum of all the salaries for employees who were hired 
after January 1, 2000, or you could use the DCOUNT function to compute the 
number of records in the data list for the Human Resources department.

614
Using the Database Functions
The database functions, regardless of the difference in names (and they all 
begin with the letter D) and the computations that they perform, all take the 
same three arguments as illustrated by the DAVERAGE function:
DAVERAGE(database,field,criteria)
The arguments for the database functions require the following information:
 
✦ Database is the argument that specifies the range containing the list and 
it must include the row of field names in the top row.
 
✦ Field is the argument that specifies the field whose values are to be cal-
culated by the database function (averaged in the case of the DAVERAGE 
function). You can specify this argument by enclosing the name of the 
field in double quotes (as in “Salary” or “Date Hired”), or you can do this 
by entering the number of the column in the data list (counting from left 
to right with the first field counted as 1).
 
✦ Criteria is the argument that specifies the address of the range that con-
tains the criteria that you’re using to determine which values are calcu-
lated. This range must include at least one field name that indicates the 
field whose values are to be evaluated and one cell with the values or 
expression to be used in the evaluation.
Note that in specifying the field argument, you must refer to a column in the 
data list that contains numeric or date data for all the database functions 
with the exception of DGET. All the rest of the database functions can’t per-
form computations on text fields. If you mistakenly specify a column with 
text entries as the field argument for these database functions, Excel returns 
an error value or 0 as the result. Table 2-2 lists the various database func-
tions available in Excel along with an explanation of what each one calcu-
lates (you already know what arguments each one takes).

DGET
Extracts a single value from a record in the data 
list that matches the criteria you specify. If no 
record matches, the function returns the #VALUE! 
error value. If multiple records match, the function 
returns the #NUM! error value.
DMAX
Returns the highest value in a field of the data list 
that matches the criteria you specify.
DMIN
Returns the lowest value in a field of the data list 
that matches the criteria you specify.
DPRODUCT
Multiplies all the values in a field of the data list 
that match the criteria you specify.
DSTDEV
Estimates the standard deviation based on the 
sample of values in a field of the data list that 
match the criteria you specify.
DSTDEVP
Calculates the standard deviation based on the 
population of values in a field of the data list that 
match the criteria you specify.
DSUM
Sums all the values in a field of the data list that 
match the criteria you specify.
DVAR
Estimates the variance based on the sample of 
values in a field of the data list that match the cri-
teria you specify.
DVARP
Calculates the variance based on the population 
of values in a field of the data list that match the 
criteria you specify.
 
The Database functions are too rarely used to rate their own command 
button on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab. As a result, to use them in a work-
sheet, you must click the Function Wizard (fx) button on the Formula bar 
and then click Database in the Select a Category drop-down list box and then 
click the function to use or type the Database function directly into the cell.
Figure 2-8 illustrates the use of the database function, DSUM. Cell C2 in the 
worksheet shown in this figure contains the following formula:
=DSUM(A3:J35,”Salary”,F1:F2)
This DSUM function computes the total of all the salaries in the data list that 
are above $55,000. This total is $468,500, as shown in cell C2, which contains 
the formula.

entire data list, including the top row of field names as the database argu-
ment (which Excel returned as an absolute range address). I then specified 
“Salary” as the field argument of the DSUM function because this is the name 
of the field that contains the values that I want totaled. Finally, I specified the 
range E1:E2 as the criteria argument of the DSUM function because these two 
cells contain the criteria range that designate that only the values exceeding 
55000 in the Salary field are to be summed.
External Data Query
Excel makes it possible to query other external databases to which you have 
access and then extract the data that interests you into your worksheet for 
further manipulation and analysis. Excel 2010 makes it easy to acquire data 
from a variety of different data sources, including Microsoft Access database 
files, Web pages on the Internet, text files, and other data sources such as 
database tables on SQL servers, XML data files, and data tables following 
the OLEDB (Object Linked Embedded Database) and ODBC (Open Database 
Connectivity) specifications.

Retrieving data from Access database tables
To make an external data query to an Access database table, you click the 
From Access command button on the Ribbon’s Data tab or press Alt+AFA. 
Excel opens the Select Data Source dialog box where you select the name 
of the Access database (using an *.mdb file extension) and then click Open. 
The Select Table dialog box then appears from which you can select the data 
table that you want to import into the worksheet.
After you click the name of the Access data table and click OK, the Import 
Data dialog box appears. This table contains the following option buttons 
from which to select:
 
✦ Table to have the data in the Access data table imported into an Excel 
table in either the current or new worksheet — see Existing Worksheet 
and New Worksheet entries that follow.
 
✦ PivotTable Report to have the data in the Access data table imported 
into a new pivot table (see Book VII, Chapter 2) that you can construct 
with the Access data.
 
✦ PivotChart and PivotTable Report to have the data in the Access data 
table imported into a new pivot table (see Book VII, Chapter 2) with an 
embedded pivot chart that you can construct with the Access data.
 
✦ Only Create Connection to create a connection to the Access database 
table that you can use later to actually import its data.
 
✦ Existing Worksheet (default) to have the data in the Access data table 
imported into the current worksheet starting at the current cell address 
listed in the text box below.
 
✦ New Worksheet to have the data in the Access data table imported into 
a new sheet that’s added to the beginning of the workbook.
Figure 2-9 shows you an Excel worksheet after importing the Orders data 
table from the sample Northwind Access database as a new data table in 
Excel. After importing the data, you can then use the Filter buttons attached 
to the various fields to sort the data (as described in Book VI, Chapter 1) and 
filter the data (as described earlier in this chapter).
 
Excel keeps a list of all the external data queries you make so that you can 
reuse them to import updated data from another database or Web page. 
To reuse a query, click the Existing Connections button on the Data tab 
(Alt+AX) to open the Existing Connections dialog box to access this list and 
then click the name of the query to repeat.

Retrieving data from the Web
To make a Web page query, you click the From Web command button on 
the Ribbon’s Data tab or press Alt+AFW. Excel then opens the New Web 
Query dialog box containing the home page for your computer’s default Web 
browser (Internet Explorer 8 in most cases). To select the Web page contain-
ing the data you want to import into Excel, you can
 
✦ Type the URL Web address in the Address text box at the top of the 
Home page in the New Web Query dialog box.
 
✦ Use the Search feature offered on the home page or its links to find the 
Web page containing the data you wish to import.
When you have the Web page containing the data you want to import dis-
played in the New Web Query dialog box, Excel indicates which tables of 
information you can import from the Web page into the worksheet by adding 
a check box with an arrowhead pointing right. To import these tables, you 
simply click this check box to add a check mark to it (see Figure 2-10).

After you finish checking all the tables you want to import on the page, click 
the Import button to close the New Web Query dialog box. Excel then opens 
a version of the Import Data dialog box with only the Table option button 
available. Here, you can indicate where the table data is to be imported by 
selecting one of these two option buttons:
 
✦ Existing Worksheet (default) to have the data in the Access data table 
imported into the current worksheet starting at the current cell address 
listed in the text box below.
 
✦ New Worksheet to have the data in the Access data table imported into 
a new sheet that’s added to the beginning of the workbook.
After you click OK in the Import Data dialog box, Excel closes the box and 
then imports all the tables of data you selected on the Web page into a new 
worksheet starting at cell A1 or in the existing worksheet starting at the cell 
whose address was entered in the text box in the Import Data dialog box.
Figure 2-11 shows the results of a Web query initiated in the New Web Query 
dialog box shown in Figure 2-10. As you can see, Excel brings this table of 
data containing the Top Mutual Fund performers as of January 3, 2010 into 
the new worksheet as a cell range rather than as an Excel table. If you then 
want to be able to sort or filter these imported data, you then need to select 
each range in turn and click the Filter button on the Data tab of the Ribbon 
or press Alt+AFF to add the requisite filter buttons.

You can only make Web queries when your computer has Internet access. 
So, if you’re using Excel on a laptop computer that can’t connect to the Web 
at the moment, you won’t be able to perform a new Web query until you’re 
in a place where you can get online.
Retrieving data from text files
If you have a text file containing data you need to bring into your work-
sheet, you can import it by clicking the From Text command button on the 
Ribbon’s Data tab (Alt+AFT) and then selecting the file to use in the Import 
Text File dialog box. After you select the text file containing the data you 
need to retrieve in this dialog box and click its Import button, Excel opens 
the first dialog box of the Text Import Wizard, which you can then use to tell 
Excel how to split up (or parse) its data into separate cells of the worksheet.
Most text files containing lists of related data use some sort of standard 
character to separate each data item (such as a comma or tab) in every line, 
just as it uses the character for the Enter key to mark the separation of each 
line of data within the file. Those text files that use the comma to separate 
data items are known as CSV files (for Comma Separated Values). Those that 
use tabs to separate the individual data items are known as Tab delimited 
files. Note that some programs use the generic term, delimited files, to refer 
to any text file that uses a standard character, such as a comma or tab, to 
separate its individual data items.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Filtering and 
Querying a Data List
621
External Data Query
The Text Import Wizard uses these facts about text files to analyze the struc-
ture of incoming text files to help you to determine how to parse the data in 
the text file. Because the Text Import Wizard always imports the parsed text 
data into the current worksheet starting at the active cell and then uses as 
many subsequent columns and rows as necessary, you should always select 
an empty cell at the beginning of a blank region in the worksheet (or better 
yet, in a blank worksheet) before you invoke the Text Import Wizard. That 
way, you never run the risk of the incoming text file data wiping out existing 
data in the worksheet.
Figure 2-12 illustrates how the Text Import Wizard works and can help you 
to successfully import a text file that consists of a data list into an Excel 
worksheet. This figure shows the Text Import Wizard — Step 1 of 3 dialog 
box that first appears when you try to open a text file from the Import Text 
File dialog box.
 
Figure 2-12: 
The first 
of three 
Text Import 
Wizard 
dialog boxes 
for parsing a 
text file.
 
As this figure shows, Excel has analyzed the data and determined that it uses 
some sort of delimiting character. If you’re dealing with a text file in which 
the data items all use the same number of characters (such as 11 spaces for 
SSN and 10 spaces for ID number), click the Fixed Width option button.
The Text Import Wizard always assumes that you want to start importing the 
data from the first to the very last line in the text file. If you don’t need the 
first line or lines imported (because they contain data, such as titles, that 
you’d only have to eliminate from the worksheet if you did bring them in), 
use the preview list box to determine the number of the first line to import 
and then enter that number in the Start Import Row text box or use its spin-
ner buttons to select this number.
Figure 2-13 shows the second Text Import Wizard dialog box that appears 
when you click the Next button in the Step 1 of 3 dialog box. As you can see, 
the Text Import Wizard — Step 2 of 3 dialog box contains a Data Preview sec-
tion that shows your text data aligned (simulating their column arrangement 
in your Excel worksheet).

622
External Data Query
 
Figure 2-13:

In the Step 2 of 3 dialog box, you need to select the delimiting character in 
the event that the wizard selects the wrong character in the Delimiters sec-
tion. If your text file uses a custom delimiting character, you need to click 
the Other check box and then enter that character in its text box. If your file 
uses two consecutive characters (such as a comma and a space), you need 
to click their check boxes as well as the Treat Consecutive Delimiters As One 
check box.
By default, the Text Import Wizard treats any characters enclosed in a pair 
of double quotes as text entries (as opposed to numbers). If your text file 
uses a single quote, click the single quote (‘) character in the Text Qualifier 
drop-down list box.
Figure 2-14 shows you the third Text Import Wizard dialog box that appears 
when you click the Next button in the Step 2 of 3 dialog box. In the Step 3 
of 3 dialog box, you get to assign a data format to the various columns of 
text data or indicate that a particular column of data should be skipped and 
therefore not imported into your Excel worksheet.

623
External Data Query
When setting data formats for the columns of the text file, you can choose 
among the following three data types:
 
✦ General (the default) to convert all numeric values to numbers, entries 
recognized as date values to dates, and everything else in the column 
to text.
 
✦ Text to convert all the entries in the column to text.
 
✦ Date to convert all the entries to dates by using the date format shown 
in the associated drop-down list box.
To assign one of the three data types to a column, click its column in the 
Data Preview section and then click the appropriate radio button (General, 
Text, or Date) in the Column Data Format section in the upper-right corner.
In determining values when using the General data format, Excel uses the 
period (.) as the decimal separator and the comma (,) as the thousands 
separator. If you’re dealing with data that uses these two symbols in just the 
opposite way (the comma for the decimal and the period for the thousands 
separator), as is the case in many European countries, click the Advanced 
button in the Step 3 of 3 dialog box to open the Advanced Text Import 
Settings dialog box. There, click the comma (,) in the Decimal Separator 
drop-down list box and the period (.) in the Thousands Separator drop-down 
list box before you click OK. If your text file uses trailing minus signs (as in 
100–) to represent negative numbers (as in –100), make sure that the Trailing 
Minus for Negative Numbers check box contains a check mark.
If you want to change the date format for a column to which you’ve assigned 
the Date data format, click its M-D-Y code in the Date drop-down list box 
(where M stands for the month, D for the day, and Y for the year).
 
To skip the importing of a particular column, click it in the Data Preview and 
then click the Do Not Import Column (Skip) option button at the bottom of 
the Column Data Format section.
After you have all the columns formatted as you want, click the Finish button 
to import and parse the text file data starting at the current cell. Figure 2-15 
shows the rows of the imported and parsed text data that appeared in the 
new worksheet starting at cell A1 when I clicked the Finish button in the 
Text Import Wizard — Step 3 of 3 dialog box.

Querying data from other data sources
Database tables created and maintained with Microsoft Office Access are 
not, of course, the only external database sources on which you can perform 
external data queries. To import data from other sources, you click the From 
Other Sources button on the Data tab or press Alt+AFO to open a drop-down 
menu with the following options:
 
✦ From SQL Server to import data from an SQL server table.
 
✦ From Analysis Services to import data from an SQL Server Analysis 
cube.
 
✦ From XML Data Import to import data from an XML file that you open 
and map.
 
✦ From Data Connection Wizard to import data from a database table 
using the Data Connection Wizard that follows the OLEDB (Object 
Linked Embedded Database) standards.
 
✦ From Microsoft Query to import data from a database table using 
Microsoft Query that follows the ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity) 
standards.

External Data Query
Retrieving external data with Microsoft Query
To retrieve data from an external database using Microsoft Query, you must 
complete two procedures. In the first procedure, you define the data source, 
that is, the database that contains the data you want to query. In the second 
procedure, you specify the data query itself, including all the columns of 
data that you want extracted along with the criteria for selecting particular 
records.
Creating a new data source definition
To perform the first procedure that creates the new data source, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the From Other Sources command button on the Ribbon’s Data 
tab or press Alt+AFO and then click From Microsoft Query on its drop-
down menu.
 
 The first time you do this, Excel displays an Alert dialog box stating 
that the Microsoft Query feature is not currently installed and asking if 
you want to install this feature now. Click Yes to have Excel install this 
feature. (Remember that you must have your Office 2010 DVD handy or 
be able to specify the path on your company’s network where the neces-
sary files are stored in order to do this.)
 
 After Microsoft Query is installed on your system, the Choose Data 
Source dialog box, shown in Figure 2-16, appears with the <New Data 
Source> item at the top of the list box on the Databases tab automati-
cally selected.
 
2. Click OK to accept the default <New Data Source> setting in the 
Choose Data Source dialog box.
 
 This action opens the Create New Data Source dialog box where you 
need to name your new database query and specify the driver to be 
used in accessing the external database.
 
Figure 2-16: 
Using the 
Choose 
Data Source 
dialog box 
to create 
a new

query.
 

626
External Data Query
 
3. Enter a descriptive name for the database query in the What Name Do 
You Want to Give Your New Data Source text box.
 
 By naming the data source definition, you can reuse it without having 
to go through all these tedious steps for defining it. Next, you need to 
select a driver for your data source in the Select a Driver for the Type 
of Database You Want to Access drop-down list box. This list contains 
drivers for all the most popular PC databases, such as Access, dBASE, 
Paradox, and FoxPro, as well as an SQL driver for sophisticated data-
base management systems, such as dB2 and an ODBC Oracle driver for 
querying an Oracle database (to name a few).
 
4. Click the name of the driver to be used in the Select a Driver for the 
Type of Database You Want to Access drop-down list box.
 
 Now you’re ready to select the database to be accessed.
 
5. Click the Connect button in the Create New Data Source dialog box.
 
 This action opens a dialog box where you can select the database to be 
used. For example, if you select Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb) as the 
driver in the Create New Data Source dialog box, Excel opens an ODBC 
Microsoft Access Setup dialog box.
 
6. Click the Select button, locate the folder that contains the database 
file that you want to query in the Select Database dialog box, and then 
click OK.
 
 After you’ve selected the database to work with, you have completed 
the first major step of specifying the data source to use in your external 
query.
 
7. Click OK in the Setup dialog box for the type of database that you’re 
accessing.
 
 This action returns you to the Create New Data Source dialog box 
(shown in Figure 2-17), which now displays the name of the database 
that you selected. If you want, you can specify a default table to use in 
the database and, if you had to specify a user name and password to 
gain access to the database, you can have this information saved as part 
of the data source definition.
 
8. (Optional) Click the name of the default table in the Select a Default 
Table for Your Data Source (Optional) drop-down list box and click 
the Save My User ID and Password in the Data Source Definition check 
box to save this information.
 
 Now you’re ready to close the Create New Data Source dialog box and 
return to the Choose Data Source dialog box from which you can per-
form the second procedure of specifying your database query.

9. Click the OK button in the Create New Data Source dialog box.
 
 This action closes the Create New Data Source dialog box, returning 
you to the Choose Data Source dialog box where the name that you’ve 
given to the data source definition that you’ve just completed appears 
selected.
Specifying the database query
Now that you’ve finished the data source definition, you can use it with 
the Query Wizard to specify which fields in the database to acquire. At this 
point, the Choose Data Source dialog box is still open and the name of your 
new data source definition is selected along with the Use the Query Wizard 
to Create/Edit Queries check box.
To perform the second procedure in which you specify the conditions of the 
query by using your new data source definition, follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that the name of your data source is highlighted on the 
Databases tab and the Use the Query Wizard to Create/Edit Queries 
check box has a check mark in it and then click OK in the Choose 
Data Source dialog box.
 
 This action closes the Choose Data Source dialog box and opens the 
Query Wizard — Choose Columns dialog box, similar to the one shown 
in Figure 2-18. This dialog box contains two list boxes: the Available 
Tables and Columns list box on the left side and the Columns in Your 
Query list box on the right side.
 
 To select the fields that you want to acquire, click the Expand button (+) 
in front of the name of each table in the external database that contains 
fields that you want. Then, click the name of the field followed by the > 
button to copy the field name to the Columns in Your Query list box. To 
preview the data in that field, click the Preview Now button when the 
field name is selected in the Columns in Your Query list box.

 Note that the order in which you add the fields determines their column 
order in your Excel worksheet. To change the order after copying the 
fields to the Columns in Your Query list box, click the field and then 
click the button to the right with the triangle pointing upward to pro-
mote the field in the list, or click the button with the triangle pointing 
down to demote it in the list.
 
2. Select the fields that you want to use in the Available Tables and 
Columns list box on the left and then copy them to the Columns in 
Your Query list box on the right.
 
 After you finish selecting the fields to use in the query, you’re ready to 
move on to the next dialog box in the Query Wizard where you specify 
how the data is to be filtered.
 
3. Click Next to open the Query Wizard — Filter Data dialog box.
 
 To set up the criteria by which records are selected in the Filter Data 
dialog box (similar to the one shown in Figure 2-19), click the field for 
which you want to set criteria and then click the criteria to use in the 
drop-down list box on the left and the value to be evaluated in the 
combo box on the right.

629
External Data Query
 
 The criteria available in the drop-down list boxes on the left are the 
same as those used with the Custom AutoFilter (see the “Custom 
AutoFilter at your service” section previously in this chapter for details) 
with the exception of the “like” and “not like” and “is Null” and “is Not 
Null” operators, which are not available when setting criteria for the 
Custom AutoFilter (“like” refers to entries that sound like one that you 
enter in the associated combo box on the right and “Null” refers to 
empty entries in the field).
 
 When entering the values to be evaluated in the associated combo 
boxes on the right side of the Filter Data dialog box, you can use the 
question mark (?) and asterisk (*) wildcard characters (question marks 
for single characters and the asterisk for multiple characters) in the text 
that you enter in these boxes. You can also select data entries in a field 
from which to compare to by clicking them in the drop-down list.
 
 To set up an AND condition, make sure that the AND option button is 
selected when you specify the second and even third set of filtering 
criteria (remember that, in an AND condition, records are selected only 
when all sets of criteria are TRUE). To set up a logical OR condition, 
click the Or option button before you specify the second or even third 
set of criteria (remember that, in an OR condition, records are selected 
when any one of the sets of criteria are TRUE).
 
 Note that if you want to acquire all data in a selected field, you don’t 
specify any filtering criteria for that field in the Filter Data dialog box.
 
4. Specify the filtering criteria, including any AND and OR condition, 
in the criteria drop-down list boxes on the left and evaluation combo 
boxes on the right for each field that should be filtered in the Column 
to Filter list box.
 
 After you finish specifying the filtering to be used on the fields, you’re 
ready to specify the order in which matching records are to be sorted.
 
5. Click the Next button to open the Query Wizard — Sort Order 
dialog box.
 
 To sort the data that you acquire in the external database query, click the 
name of the field in the Sort By drop-down list box and then select either 
the Ascending (default) or Descending option button (see Figure 2-20). 
To sort any duplicates in the field that you specify as the primary sorting 
key, you select the tie-breaking field for the secondary key in the Then By 
drop-down list box and then select between its Ascending (default) and 
Descending option buttons.
 
 You repeat this procedure to sort the incoming data on up to three 
fields. If you don’t want the data sorted, click the Next button without 
selecting any fields as sorting keys.

630
External Data Query
 
6. Specify the field or fields on which the external data is to be sorted 
and then click the Next button.
 
 Clicking Next opens the Query Wizard — Finish dialog box shown 
in Figure 2-21. This dialog box contains several options that you can 
choose from in completing the query. You can return the data to the cur-
rent or a new worksheet by leaving the Return Data to Microsoft Excel 
option button selected. You can view the data and/or edit the query in 
the Microsoft Query dialog box by clicking the View Data or Edit Query 
in Microsoft Query option button.
 
 You can also save your new query by selecting the Save Query button 
in the Query Wizard — Finish dialog box. When you do this, Excel saves 
it as a separate query file (indicated by the .dqy file extension) so that 
you can reuse the query from any workbook file. Note that Excel auto-
matically saves the data source definition as a file (indicated by the 
.dsn) when you next save the current workbook but not the query.

 If you want to see the data and review your query before you bring it into 
your Excel worksheet, you click the View Data or Edit Query in Microsoft 
Query option button before you click OK in the Query Wizard — Finish 
dialog box. When you do this, Excel opens a Microsoft Query window 

Book VI

similar to the one shown in Figure 2-22, where you can preview the way 
the acquired data will appear when you bring it into Excel. You can also 
edit the database query in this window.

8. (Optional) Click the View Data or Edit Query in Microsoft Query 
option button and then click the Finish button to open the Microsoft 
Query window showing the fields and records to be acquired by the 
query along with the filtering criteria.
 
 After you finish viewing the data in the Microsoft Query window, you 
can click its Close button. Doing this opens the Import Data dialog box 
described in Step 9.
 
 The Import Data dialog box is also displayed when you click the Finish 
button when the Return Data to Microsoft Excel option button is selected 
in the Query Wizard — Finish dialog box, which is described in Step 9.
 
9. Click the Finish button in the Query Wizard — Finish dialog box.
 
 This action closes this dialog box and opens the Import Data dialog box 
(shown in Figure 2-23). Here, you indicate where you want to put the 
data acquired from the external database.
 
 By default, the Table option is selected to import the data as a simple 
data list, the Existing Worksheet option button is selected, and cell A1 is 
designated as the start of this list’s range. To import the external data as 
a new pivot table (see Book VII, Chapter 2), click the PivotTable Report 
option button. To import the data as a new pivot table and pivot chart, 
click the PivotChart and PivotTable Report option button. To change 
the starting cell, click it in the worksheet. To import the data into a 
brand-new worksheet in the current workbook, click the New Worksheet 
option button instead.

10. Indicate how you want to view the data and where you want the data 
imported during the query and then click OK to start importing the data.
 
 As soon as you click OK, Excel executes the database query and 
acquires the data from the external database (see Figure 2-24). After 
the program finishes importing all the records that match your filtering 
criteria (when the Table option is selected), the program also displays 
the Table Tools contextual tab and selects its sole Design tab. You can 
use the command buttons on the Design tab to further format the table 
(by selecting a new table style in the Table Styles gallery), refresh the 
data by performing the query again (with the Refresh command button), 
or summarize the data list by creating a pivot table for it (with the 
Summarize with Pivot command button).

After you’ve saved a data query, you can use it to connect to an external 
database and to acquire its data according to the query’s parameters. To do 
this, click the Existing Connections command button on the Data tab of the 
Ribbon (or press Alt+AX) to open the Existing Connections dialog box and 
there click the descriptive name given to your query before you click the 
Open button.
After you perform an external query using Microsoft Query that extracts the 
data as a table, you can use the following command buttons on the Design 
tab of the Table Tools contextual tab:
 
✦ Table Name text box to change the name of the data table containing 
the external data.
 
✦ Resize the Table command button to select a new data range for the 
data retrieved by the external query.
 
✦ Summarize with PivotTable command button to open the Create 
PivotTable dialog box that enables you to create a new pivot table using 
the data retrieved by the external query (see Book VII, Chapter 2).
 
✦ Remove Duplicates command button to remove all duplicate entries 
from the data table.
 
✦ Convert to Range command button to convert the data table contain-
ing the external data into a regular range of data (which removes the 
AutoFilter buttons and table formatting).
 
✦ Export command button to export the external data to a SharePoint list 
(see Book IV, Chapter 4) or a Visio diagram.
 
✦ Refresh command button to have Excel redo the query and automati-
cally update the data table according to any changes made to the exter-
nal database table(s).
 
✦ Properties command button to open the External Data Properties dialog 
box where you can change formatting and layout options for the data 
retrieved in the worksheet.
 
✦ Open in Browser command button to open the external data as a table 
in your computer’s Web browser.
 
✦ Unlink command button to sever a link between the data retrieved in 
the worksheet by the external query and its original data source on a 
server so that the data are no longer automatically kept up-to-date.

ecause electronic spreadsheets are so good at updating their results 
by automatically recalculating their formulas based on new input, they 
have long been used (and sometimes, misused) to create financial projec-
tions based on all sorts of assumptions. Under the guise of what-if analy-
sis, you will often find the number crunchers of the company using Excel 
as their crystal ball for projecting the results of all sorts of harebrained 
schemes designed to make the company a fast million bucks.
As you start dabbling in this form of electronic fortune-telling, keep in mind 
that the projections you get back from this type of analysis are only as good 
as your assumptions. So when the results of what-if analysis tell you that 
you’re going to be richer than King Midas after undertaking this new busi-
ness venture, you still need to ask yourself whether the original assump-
tions on which these glowing projections are based fit in with real-world 
marketing conditions. In other words, when the worksheet tells you that 
you can make a million bucks of pure profit by selling your lead-lined boxer 
shorts, you still have to question how many men really need that kind of 
protection and are willing to pay for it.
In Excel, what-if analysis comes in a fairly wide variety of flavors (some of 
which are more complicated than others). In this chapter, I introduce you to 
three simple and straightforward methods:
 
✦ Data tables enable you to see how changing one or two variables affect 
the bottom line (for example, you may want to know what happens to 
the net profit if you fall into a 45 percent tax bracket, a 60 percent tax 
bracket, and so on).

638
Using Data Tables
 
✦ Goal seeking enables you to find out what it takes to reach a predeter-
mined objective, such as how much you have to sell to make a $20 mil-
lion profit this year.
 
✦ Scenarios let you set up and test a wide variety of cases, all the way from 
the best-case scenario (profits grow by 20 percent) to the worst-case 
scenario (you don’t make any profit).
At the end of the chapter, I introduce you to the Solver add-in utility, which 
enables you to find solutions to more complex what-if problems involving 
multiple variables. You can use the Solver to help you with classic resource 
problems, such as finding the correct product mix in order to maximize 
your profits, staffing to minimize your general costs, and routing to minimize 
transportation costs.
Using Data Tables
In an Excel spreadsheet, you can see the effect of changing an input value 
on the result returned by a formula as soon as you enter a new input value 
in the cell that feeds into the formula. Each time you change this input 
value, Excel automatically recalculates the formula and shows you the new 
result based on the new value. This method is of limited use, however, when 
you are performing what-if analysis and need to be able to see the range of 
results produced by using a series of different input values in the same work-
sheet so that you can compare them to each other.
To perform this type of what-if analysis, you can use Excel’s Data Table com-
mand. When creating a data table, you enter a series of input values in the 
worksheet, and Excel uses each value in the formula that you specify. When 
Excel is finished computing the data table, you see the results produced 
by each change in the input values in a single range of the worksheet. You 
can then save the data table as part of the worksheet if you need to keep a 
record of the results of a series of input values.
When creating data tables, you can create a one-variable or a two-variable 
data table. In a one-variable data table, Excel substitutes a series of different 
values for a single input value in a formula. In a two-variable data table, Excel 
substitutes a series of different values for two input values in a formula.
Creating a one-variable data table
To create a one-variable data table, you need to set up the master formula 
in your worksheet and then, in a different range of the worksheet, enter the 
series of different values that you want substituted for a single input value in 
that formula. Figures 1-1 and 1-2 demonstrate how this is done.

Scenarios

Using Data Tables
In Figure 1-1, cell B5 contains a simple formula for computing the projected 
sales for 2010, assuming an annual growth rate of 1.75% over the annual 
sales in 2009. The 2010 projected sales in this cell are calculated with the fol-
lowing formula:
=_2009_Total_Sales+(_2009_Total_Sales*_2010_Growth_Rate)
This formula adds cell B2 (named _2009_Total_Sales) to the contents of B2 
multiplied by the growth rate of 1.75% in cell B3 (named _2010_Growth_
Rate). Cell B5 shows you that, assuming an annual growth rate of 1.75% in 
the year 2010, you can project total sales of $890,312.50 (which appears in 
the cell as $890,313 using the Comma style format with no decimal places).
But what if the growth rate in 2010 is not as low as 1.75%, or what if the 
growth rate is even (heaven forbid) lower than anticipated? To create the 
one-variable table to answer these questions, you first bring forward the 
master formula in cell B5 to cell C7 with the formula =B5. Then, you enter 
the series of different growth rates as the input values in column B, starting 
in cell B8 (cell B7, at the intersection of the row with the master formula and 
the column with the input values, must be left blank in a one-variable data 
table). This series of input values for the data table can be created with the 
AutoFill feature (see Book II, Chapter 1 for details). In this example, a data 
series that increments each succeeding value by 0.5% percent is created in 
the cell range B8:B17, starting at 1 percent and ending at 5.5% percent.
After bringing the formula in cell B5 forward to cell C7 with the formula =B5 
and generating the growth rate series in the cell range B8:B17, you then 
select the cell range B7:C17 and click the What-If Analysis command button 
in the Data Tools group on the Data tab and then click Data Table on its 
drop-down menu (or press Alt+AWT) to open the Data Table dialog box 
shown in Figure 1-1.
In this dialog box, you specify the row input cell in the Row Input Cell text 
box and/or the column input cell in the Column Input Cell text box. The cell 
that you designate as the row or column input cell in the Table dialog box 
must correspond to the cell in the worksheet that contains the original input 
value that is fed into the master formula.
In the data table in this example, you need to designate only B3 as the 
column input cell. (In the case of Figure 1-1, when you click this cell or use 
an arrow key to select this cell, Excel enters the absolute cell reference, as in 
$B$3.) You choose cell B3 because this is the cell that contains the growth 
rate value used in the master formula.

640
Using Data Tables
 
Figure 1-1: 
Creating a 
one-variable 
data table.
 
After indicating the row or column input cells, Excel computes the data table 
when you click the OK button. In this example, the program creates the data 
table by substituting each input value in the data series in the range B8:B17 
into the column input cell B3. The value of cell B3 is then used in the master 
formula to calculate a new result, which is entered in the corresponding cell 
in the cell range C8:C17. After the program has finished calculating the data 
table, Excel returns the original value to the row or column input cell (in this 
case, 1.75% in cell B3).
Figure 1-2 shows the completed data table. Here, you can see at a glance how 
changing a half percentage point for the growth rate affects the projected 
sales for 2010. After creating the data table, you can then format the results 
and save the table as part of the worksheet.
 
If you want to see how using a different range of variables affects the results 
in the table, you only need to enter the new input values in the existing 
range. By default, Excel automatically recalculates the results in the output 
range of a data table whenever you change any of its input values. If you 
want to control when each data table is recalculated, while still allowing 
the formulas in the worksheet to be automatically recalculated, click the 
Automatic Except Data Tables option on the Options command button on 
the Formulas tab (Alt+MXE).
Excel computes the results in a data table by creating an array formula that 
uses the TABLE function (see Book III, Chapter 1, for more information on 

Book VII
Chapter 1
Performing What-If 
Scenarios
641
Using Data Tables
array formulas). In this example, the array formula entered into the cell 
range C8:C17 is as follows:
{=TABLE(,B3)}
 
Figure 1-2: 
The 
completed 
one-variable 
data table.
 
The TABLE function can take two arguments, row_ref and/or column_ref, 
which represent the row input cell and column input cell for the data table, 
respectively. In this example, the data table uses only a column input cell, 
so B3 is the second and only argument of the TABLE function. Because Excel 
enters the results in a data table by using an array formula, Excel won’t allow 
you to clear individual result cells in its output range. If you try to delete a 
single result in the data table, Excel displays an Alert dialog box, stating that 
you can’t change part of a table.
 
If you want to delete just the results in the output range of a data table, you 
must select all the cells in the output range (cell range C8:C17, in the current 
example) before you press the Delete key or click the Clear All option on the 
Clear button’s drop-down menu (or press Alt+HEA).
Creating a two-variable data table
When you have a master formula in a worksheet in which you want to see the 
effect of changing two of its input values, you create a two-variable data table. 
When you create a two-variable data table, you enter two ranges of input 

642
Using Data Tables
values to be substituted in the master formula: a single-row range in the first 
row of the table and a single-column range in the first column of the data table. 
When you create a two-variable data table, you place a copy of the master for-
mula in the cell at the intersection of this row and column of input values.
Figure 1-3 shows the typical setup for a two-variable data table. This figure 
uses the projected sales worksheet shown previously in the section on a 
one-variable data table. Here, however, a second variable has been added to 
projecting the total sales in 2010. This worksheet contains a value in cell B4 
(named _2009_Expenses) that shows the projected percentage of expenses 
to sales, which is used, in turn, in the master formula in cell B5 as follows:
=_2009_Total_Sales+(_2009_Total_Sales*_2009_Growth_Rate)–
(_2009_Total_Sales*_2009_Expenses)
Note that when you factor in the expenses, the projected sales at an annual 
growth rate of 1.75% falls in cell B5 from $890,313 to $802,813.
To determine how changing both the growth rate and the percentage of 
expenses to sales will affect the projected sales for 2010, you create a 
two-variable data table. In setting up this table, you still enter the variable 
growth rates down column B in the cell range B8:B17. Then, you enter the 
variable expense rates across row 7 in the range C7:F7. This time, you bring 
forward the master formula by entering the formula =B5 in cell B7, the cell at 
the intersection of the row and column containing the two input variables.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Creating a 
two-variable 
data table.
 

Book VII

643
Using Data Tables
After setting up the two series of variables in this manner, you are ready to 
create the table by selecting the cell range B7:F17 and opening the Table 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-3. For a two-variable data table, you must 
designate both a row input and column cell in the worksheet. In this exam-
ple, the row input cell is B4, which contains the original expense-to-sales per-
centage, while the column input cell remains B3, which contains the original 
growth rate. After these two input cells are entered in the Table dialog box, 
you are ready to generate the data table by clicking the OK button.
Figure 1-4 shows the completed two-variable data table with the results of 
changing both the projected growth rate and the projected expenses. As 
with a one-variable data table, you can save this two-variable data table as 
part of your worksheet. You can also update the table by changing any of the 
(two types) input variables.
The array formula entered in the output range (C8:F17) to create this two-
variable data table is very similar to the one created previously for the one-
variable data table, only this time the TABLE function uses both a row_ref 
and column_ref argument as follows:
{=TABLE(B4,B3)}
 
Remember that because this data table used an array formula, you must 
select all the cells in the output range if you want to delete them.

Exploring Different Scenarios
Exploring Different Scenarios
Excel enables you to create and save sets of input values that produce dif-
ferent results as scenarios with the Scenario Manager option on the What-If 
Analysis button’s drop-down menu on the Data tab of the Ribbon. A scenario 
consists of a group of input values in a worksheet to which you assign a 
name, such as Best Case, Worst Case, Most Likely Case, and so on. Then, to 
reuse the input data and view the results that they produce in the work-
sheet, you simply select the name of the scenario that you want to use, and 
Excel applies the input values stored in that scenario to the appropriate 
cells in the worksheet. After creating your different scenarios for a work-
sheet, you can also use the Scenario Manager to create a summary report 
showing both the input values stored in each scenario and the key results 
produced by each.
Creating new scenarios
When creating a scenario for your worksheet, you create a spreadsheet 
that uses certain cells that change in each scenario (appropriately enough, 
called changing cells). To make it easier to identify the changing cells in each 
scenario that you create (especially in any scenario summary reports that 
you generate), you should assign range names to the variables in the spread-
sheet with the Name a Range or Create from Selection command buttons on 
the Formulas tab of the Ribbon before you create your scenarios.
To create your scenarios with the Scenario Manager, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the changing cells in the spreadsheet; that is, the cells whose 
values vary in each of your scenarios.
 
 Remember that you can select nonadjacent cells in the worksheet by 
holding down the Ctrl key as you click them.
 
2. Click the What-If Analysis command button on the Ribbon’s Data tab 
and then click Scenario Manager on its drop-down menu or press 
Alt+AWS.
 
 This action opens the Scenario Manager dialog box, similar to the one 
shown in Figure 1-5.
 
3. Click the Add button in the Scenario Manager dialog box.
 
 This action opens the Add Scenario dialog box, similar to the one shown 
in Figure 1-6. The Add Scenario dialog box contains a Scenario Name 
text box, where you give the new scenario a descriptive name such as 
Best Case, Most Likely Case, and so on. This dialog box also contains a 
Changing Cells text box that contains the addresses of the variable cells 
that you selected in the worksheet and a Comment box that contains a 
note with your name and the current date, so you’ll always know when 
you created the particular scenario.

4. Type a descriptive name for the new scenario in the Scenario Name 
text box.
 
 Now, you should check over the cell references in the Changing Cells 
text box to make sure that they’re correct. You can modify them if 
necessary by clicking the Changing Cells text box and then by clicking 
the cells in the worksheet while holding down the Ctrl key. (Note that 
when you do so, Excel automatically changes the name of the dialog box 
from Add Scenario to Edit Scenario.) You can also edit the note in the 
Comment box if you want to add more information about your assump-
tions as part of the new scenario.
 
 By default, Excel protects a scenario from changes when you turn on pro-
tection for the worksheet (see Book IV, Chapter 1, for details) so that you 
can’t edit or delete the scenario in any way. If you want Excel to hide the 
scenario as well when worksheet protection is turned on, click the Hide 
check box. If you don’t want to protect or hide the scenario when work-
sheet protection is turned on, click the Prevent Changes check box to 
remove its check mark, and leave the Hide check box as it is.
 
5. In the Protection section of the Add Scenario dialog box, choose what 
kind of scenario protection that you need, if any, with the Prevent 
Changes and Hide check boxes.
 
 Now you’re ready to specify the changing values for the new scenario.

646
Exploring Different Scenarios
 
6. Click OK in the Add Scenario dialog box.
 
 This action closes the Add Scenario dialog box and then opens the 
Scenario Values dialog box, similar to the one shown in Figure 1-7. The 
Scenario Values dialog box numbers and shows the range name (assum-
ing that you named each of the cells), followed by the current value for 
each of the changing values that you selected in the worksheet before 
starting to define different scenarios for your spreadsheet.
 
 You can accept the values shown in the text box for each changing cell 
if it suits the current scenario that you’re defining, or you can increase 
or decrease any or all of them as needed to reflect the scenario’s 
assumptions.
 
7. Check the values in each changing cell’s text box and modify the 
values as needed.
 
 Now you’re ready to close the Scenario Values dialog box, which com-
pletes the definition of the new scenario.
 
8. Click the Add button in the Scenario Values dialog box.
 
 This action closes the Scenario Values dialog box and returns you to the 
Add Scenario dialog box, where you can define a new scenario name for 
the changing cells.
 
9. Repeat Steps 4 to 7 to add all the other scenarios that you want to 
create.
 
 After you finish defining all the different scenarios you want to apply 
to the changing values in the spreadsheet, you can close the Scenario 
Values dialog box and then return to the Scenario Manager dialog box 
where you can use the Show button to see how using different sets of 
changing values affects your spreadsheet.
 
10. Click OK in the Add Values dialog box and then click the Close button 
in the Scenario Manager dialog box.

Exploring Different Scenarios
When you return to the Scenario Manager dialog box, the names of all the 
scenarios that you added appear in the Scenarios list box. For example, in 
Figure 1-8, you see that three scenarios — Most Likely, Best Case, and Worst 
Case — are now listed in the Scenarios list box.
To show a particular scenario in the worksheet that uses the values you 
entered for the changing cells, you simply double-click the scenario name 
in this list box or click the name and then click the Show command button. 
Figure 1-8 shows the results in the sample forecast worksheet after showing 
the Worst Case scenario.
If, after creating the scenarios for your worksheet, you find that you need to 
use different input values or you want to add or remove scenarios, you can 
edit the scenarios in the Scenario Manager dialog box. To modify the sce-
nario’s name and/or the input values assigned to the changing cells of that 
scenario, click the scenario name in the Scenarios list box and then click 
the Edit button so that you can make the appropriate changes in the Edit 
Scenario dialog box. To remove a scenario from a worksheet, select the sce-
nario’s name in the Scenarios list box and then click the Delete button. Note, 
however, that if you delete a scenario in error, you can’t restore it with the 
Undo command. Instead, you must re-create the scenario by using the Add 
command button as outlined previously.

648
Exploring Different Scenarios
You can also merge scenarios from other Excel workbook files that are 
open (of course, the workbooks should share the same spreadsheet layout 
and changing cells). To merge a scenario into the current worksheet from 
another workbook, click the Merge button in the Scenario Manager dialog 
box, and then select the workbook in the Book drop-down list box and the 
worksheet in the Sheet drop-down list box before you click OK. Excel then 
copies all the scenarios defined for that worksheet and merges them with 
any scenarios that you’ve defined for the current worksheet.
Producing a summary report
After creating the different scenarios for your worksheet, you can use the 
Summary button in the Scenario Manager dialog box to create a summary 
report that shows the changing values used in each scenario and, if you 
want, key resulting values that each produces. When you click the Summary 
button, Excel opens a Scenario Summary dialog box, similar to the one 
shown in Figure 1-9, where you may designate a cell selection of result cells 
in the Result Cells text box to be included in the report. After selecting the 
result cells for the report, click OK to have Excel generate the summary 
report and display it in a new worksheet window.
 
Figure 1-9:

dialog box.
 
In the example shown in Figure 1-9, the cell range B7:F7, containing the pro-
jected income figures for the sales forecast, are designated as the result cells 
to be included in the summary report. Figure 1-10 shows the actual summary 
report generated for this sample worksheet in a new document window. 

Book VII
Chapter 1
Performing What-If 
Scenarios
649
Hide and Goal Seeking
Note that because all the changing and result cells in this worksheet are 
named, the summary report uses their range names in place of their cell 
references. Also, when the Scenario Manager generates a summary report, it 
automatically outlines the summary data, thus creating two vertical levels — 
one for the changing cells and another for the result cells.
 
Figure 1-10:

After generating a summary report, you can save it by clicking the Save com-
mand button on the Quick Access toolbar (Ctrl+S) and/or print it by clicking 
the Quick Print command button (Ctrl+P).
 
Note that the Scenario Summary dialog box contains an option, Scenario 
Pivot/Table Report, which enables you to view the scenario results as a 
pivot table. See Book VII, Chapter 2, for details on the uses of pivot tables.
Hide and Goal Seeking
Sometimes, you know the outcome that you want to realize in a worksheet 
and you need Excel to help you find the input values necessary to achieve 
those results. This procedure, which is just the opposite of the what-if analy-
sis that I’ve been examining in this chapter, is referred to as goal seeking.
When you simply need to find the value for a single variable that will give the 
desired result in a particular formula, you can perform this simple type of 
goal seeking with the Goal Seek command. If you have charted the data and 
created a two-dimensional column, bar, or line chart, you can also perform 
the goal seeking by directly manipulating the appropriate marker on the 

650
Hide and Goal Seeking
chart. And when you need to perform more complex goal seeking, such as 
that which involves changing multiple input values to realize a result or con-
straining the values to a specific range, you can use the Solver command.
To use the Goal Seek command, simply select the cell containing the formula 
that will return the result that you are seeking (referred to as the set cell), indi-
cate what value you want this formula to return, and then indicate the location 
of the input value that Excel can change to return the desired result. Figures 
1-11 and 1-12 illustrate how you can use the Goal Seek command to find how 
much sales must increase to realize first quarter income of $200,000 (given 
certain growth, cost of goods sold, and expense assumptions).
To find out how much sales must increase to return a net income of $200,000 
in the first quarter, you first select cell B7, which contains the formula 
that calculates the first quarter income before you click Goal Seek on the 
What-If Analysis button’s drop-down menu on the Ribbon’s Data tab or press 
Alt+AWG. This action opens the Goal Seek dialog box, similar to the one 
shown in Figure 1-11. Because cell B7 is the active cell when you open this 
dialog box, the Set Cell text box already contains the cell reference B7. You 
then select the To Value text box and enter 200000 as the goal. Then, you 
select the By Changing Cell text box and select cell B3 in the worksheet (the 
cell that contains the first quarter sales).
Figure 1-12 shows you the Goal Seek Status dialog box that appears when 
you click OK in the Goal Seek dialog box to have Excel go ahead and adjust 
the sales figure to reach your desired income figure. As this figure shows, 
Excel increases the sales in cell B3 from $250,000 to $307,692.31, which, in 
turn, returns $200,000 as the income in cell B7. The Goal Seek Status dialog 
box informs you that goal seeking has found a solution and that the current 
value and target value are now the same. (If this were not the case, the Step 
and Pause buttons in the dialog box would become active, and you could 
have Excel perform further iterations to try to narrow and ultimately elimi-
nate the gap between the target and current values.)
If you want to keep the values entered in the worksheet as a result of goal 
seeking, click OK to close the Goal Seek Status dialog box. If you want to 
return to the original values, click the Cancel button instead. If you change 
the value by clicking OK, remember that you can still switch between the 
“before” and “after” input values and results by clicking the Undo button on 
the Quick Access toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+Z.
 
To flip back and forth between the “after” and “before” values when you’ve 
closed the Goal Seek Status dialog box, press Ctrl+Z to display the original 
values before goal seeking and then Ctrl+Y to display the values engendered 
by the goal-seeking solution.

Using the Solver
Although the Data Table and Goal Seek commands work just fine for simple 
problems that require determining the direct relationship between the 
inputs and results in a formula, you need to use the Solver add-in when deal-
ing with more complex problems. For example, use the Solver to find the 
best solution when you need to change multiple input values in your model 
and you need to impose constraints on these values and/or the output value.
The Solver add-in works by applying iterative methods to find the “best” 
solution given the inputs, desired solution, and the constraints that you 
impose. With each iteration, the program applies a trial-and-error method 
(based on the use of linear or nonlinear equations and inequalities) that 
attempts to get closer to the optimum solution.

652
Using the Solver
When using the Solver add-in, keep in mind that many problems, especially 
the more complicated ones, have many solutions. Although the Solver 
returns the optimum solution, given the starting values, the variables that 
can change, and the constraints that you define, this solution is often not the 
only one possible and, in fact, may not be the best solution for you. To be 
sure that you are finding the best solution, you may want to run the Solver 
more than once, adjusting the initial values each time you solve the problem.
When setting up the problem for the Solver add-in in your worksheet, define 
the following items:
 
✦ Target cell: The cell in your worksheet whose value is to be maximized, 
minimized, or made to reach a particular value.
 
✦ Changing cells: The cells in your worksheet whose values are to be 
adjusted until the answer is found.
 
✦ Constraints: The limits that you impose on the changing values and/or 
the target cell.
After you finish defining the problem with these parameters and have the 
Solver add-in solve the problem, the program returns the optimum solution 
by modifying the values in your worksheet. At this point, you can choose 
to retain the changes in the worksheet or restore the original values to the 
worksheet. You can also save the solution as a scenario to view later before 
you restore the original values.
 
You can use the Solver add-in with the Scenario Manager to help set up a 
problem to solve or to save a solution so that you can view it at a later date. 
The changing cells that you define for the Scenario Manager are automati-
cally picked up and used by the Solver when you select this command, and 
vice versa. Also, you can save the Solver’s solution to a problem as a sce-
nario (by clicking the Save Scenario button in the Solver dialog box) that you 
can then view with the Scenario Manager.
Setting up and defining the problem
The first step in setting up a problem for the Solver to work on is to create 
the worksheet model for which you will define the target cell, changing cells, 
and the constraints.
 
Keep in mind that the Solver is an add-in utility. This means that, before 
you can use it, you need to install and load the Solver add-in program. To 
do this, open the Add-Ins tab of the Excel Options dialog box (Alt+FI) and 
then click the Go button after making sure that Excel Add-Ins is displayed in 
the Manage drop-down list box to its immediate left. Then, click the Solver 
Add-in check box in the Add-Ins dialog box to put a check mark in it before 
you click OK to close the dialog box and install the add-in.

Using the Solver
To define and solve a problem with the Solver add-in after you’ve loaded the 
add-in and have created your worksheet model, take the following steps:
 
1. Click the Solver command button in the Analysis group at the end of 
the Ribbon’s Data tab or press Alt+AY2.
 
 Excel opens the Solver Parameters dialog box, which is similar to the 
one shown in Figure 1-13.
 
2. Click the target cell in the worksheet or enter its cell reference or 
range name in the Set Objective text box.
 
 Next, you need to select the To setting. Click the Max option button 
when you want the target cell’s value to be as large as possible. Click the 
Min option button when you want the target cell’s value to be as small 
as possible. Click the Value Of option button and then enter a value in 
the associated text box when you want the target cell’s value to reach a 
particular value.
 
3. Click the appropriate option button option in the Equal To section 
of the dialog box. If you select the Value To option button, enter the 
value to match in the associated text box.
 
 Next, designate the changing cells — that is, the ones Solver can adjust 
to reach your Equal To goal.
 
4. Click the By Changing Variable Cells text box and then select the cells 
to change in the worksheet or enter their cell references or range 
name in the text box.
 
 Remember that to select nonadjacent cells in the worksheet, you need 
to hold down the Ctrl key as you click each cell in the selection. To have 
Excel choose the changing cells for you based on the target cell that you 
selected, click the Guess button to the right of this text box.
 
 Before having Solver adjust your model, you may add constraints for 
the target cell or any of the changing cells that determine its limits when 
adjusting the values.
 
5. (Optional) Click the Add button to the right of the Subject to the 
Constraints list box in the Solver Parameters dialog box.
 
 This action opens the Add Constraint dialog box, similar to the one 
shown in Figure 1-14. When defining a constraint, choose the cell whose 
value you want to constrain or select the cell in the worksheet or enter 
its cell reference in the Cell Reference text box. Then choose the rela-
tionship (=, <=, >=, or int for integer or bin for binary) in the drop-down 
list box to the right, and (unless you chose int or bin) enter the appro-
priate value or cell reference in the Constraint text box.
 
 To continue adding constraints for other cells used by the Solver, click 
the Add button to add the constraint and clear the text boxes in the Add 
Constraint dialog box. Then, repeat Step 5 to add a new constraint. After 
you finish defining constraints for the target cell and changing values in 
the model, click OK to close the Add Constraint dialog box and return to 

654
Using the Solver
the Solver Parameters dialog box (which now lists your constraints in 
the Subject to the Constraints list box).
 
6. (Optional) Click the Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative 
check box to deselect it if you want to allow negative values when the 
variable cells are not subject to constraints.
 
 By default, the Solver Add-in employs the GRG (Generalized Reduced 
Gradient) Nonlinear method in solving the model whose parameters 
you’re setting known as a very efficient way to solve smooth nonlinear 
problems. To use the LP Simplex method (for Linear Programming fol-
lowing the Simplex algorithm) or Evolutionary engine for solving non-
smooth problems, you need to follow Step 7.
 
7. (Optional) Click LP Simplex or Evolutionary in the Select a Solving 
Method drop-down list to use either one of these methods solving non-
smooth problems.
 
8. Click the Solve button to have the Solver solve the problem as you’ve 
defined it in the Solver Parameters dialog box.

Solving the problem
When you click the Solve button, the Solver Parameters dialog box disap-
pears, and the Status bar indicates that the Solver is setting up the problem 
and then keeps you informed of the progress in solving the problem by 
showing the number of the intermediate (or trial) solutions as they are tried. 
To interrupt the solution process at any time before Excel calculates the 
last iteration, press the Esc key. Excel then displays the Show Trial Solution 
dialog box, informing you that the solution process has been paused. To 
continue the solution process, click the Continue button. To abort the solu-
tion process, click the Stop button.
When Excel finishes the solution process, the Solver Results dialog box 
appears, similar to the one shown in Figure 1-15. This dialog box informs you 
whether the Solver was able to find a solution, given the target cell, changing 
cells, and constraints defined for the problem. To retain the changes that 
the Solver makes in your worksheet model, leave the Keep Solver Solution 
option button selected and click OK to close the Solver Results dialog box. 
To return the original values to the worksheet, click the Restore Original 
Values option button instead. To save the changes as a scenario before you 
restore the original values, click the Save Scenario button and assign a name 
to the current scenario before you click the Restore Original Values option 
and OK button.

Unlike when using the Goal Seek command, after clicking the Keep Solver 
Solution option button in the Solver Results dialog box, you can’t use the 
Undo command button on the Quick Access toolbar to restore the original 
values to your worksheet. If you want to be able to switch between the 
“before” and “after” views of your worksheet, you must save the changes 
with the Save Scenario button and then select the Restore Original Values 
option button option. That way, you can retain the “before” view in the origi-
nal worksheet and use the Scenario Manager to display the “after” view cre-
ated by the Solver.

Changing the Solver options
For most of the problems, the default options used by the Solver are ade-
quate. In some situations, however, you may want to change some of the 
Solver options before you begin the solution process. To change the solution 
options, click the Options button in the Solver Parameters dialog box. Excel 
then opens the Options dialog box with the All Methods tab selected, shown 
in Figure 1-16, where you can make all necessary changes (refer to Table 1-1 
for information on each option).

Saving and loading a model problem
The target cell, changing cells, constraints, and Solver options that you 
most recently used are saved as part of the worksheet when you click the 
Save button on the Quick Access toolbar (Ctrl+S). When you define other 
problems for the same worksheet that you want to save, you must choose 
the Save Model button in the Solver Options dialog box and indicate the cell 
reference or name of the range in the active worksheet where you want the 
problem’s parameters to be inserted.

658
Using the Solver
When you click the Load/Save button, Excel opens the Load/Save Model 
dialog box, containing a Select Model Area text box. This text box contains 
the cell references for a range large enough to hold all the problem’s param-
eters, starting with the active cell. To save the problem’s parameters in this 
range, click OK. If this range includes cells with existing data, you need to 
modify the cell reference in this text box before you choose OK to prevent 
Excel from replacing the existing data.
After you click OK, Excel copies the problem’s parameters in the specified 
range. These values are then saved as part of the worksheet the next time 
you save the workbook. To reuse these problem parameters when solving a 
problem, you simply need to open the Solver Options dialog box, click the 
Load/Save button to open the Load/Save Model dialog box, click the Load 
button, and then select the range containing the saved problem parameters. 
When you click OK in the Load Model dialog box, Excel loads the parameters 
from this cell range into the appropriate text boxes in the Solver Parameters 
dialog box. You can then close the Solver Options dialog box by clicking OK, 
and solve the problem by using these parameters by clicking the Solve com-
mand button.
 
Remember that you can use the Reset All button whenever you want to clear 
all the parameters defined for the previous problem and return the Solver 
options to their defaults.
Creating Solver reports
You can create three different types of reports with the Solver:
 
✦ Answer report: Lists the target cell and changing cells with their original 
and final values, along with the constraints used in solving the problem.
 
✦ Sensitivity report: Indicates how sensitive an optimal solution is to 
changes in the formulas that calculate the target cell and constraints. 
The report shows the changing cells with their final values and the 
reduced gradient for each cell (the reduced gradient measures the objec-
tive per unit increase in the changing cell). If you defined constraints, 
the Sensitivity report lists them with their final values and the Lagrange 
multiplier for each constraint (the Lagrange multiplier measures the 
objective per unit increase that appears in the right side of the con-
straint equation).
 
✦ Limits report: Shows the target cell and the changing cells with their 
values, lower and upper limits, and target results. The lower limit rep-
resents the lowest value that a changing cell can have while fixing the 
values of all other cells and still satisfying the constraints. The upper 
limit represents the highest value that will do this.

select the report type (Answer, Sensitivity, or Limits) in the Reports list box 
of the Solver Results dialog box (as shown previously in Figure 1-15). To 
select more than one report, just click the name of the report.
When you click OK to close the Solver Results dialog box (after choosing 
between the Keep Solver Solution and Restore Original Values options), Excel 
generates the report (or reports) that you selected in a new worksheet that it 
adds to the beginning of the workbook (report sheet tabs are named by report 
type, as in Answer Report 1, Sensitivity Report 1, and Limits Report 1).

T
he subject of this chapter is the pivot table, the name given to a special 
type of data summary table that you can use to analyze and reveal the 
relationships inherent in the data lists that you maintain in Excel. Pivot 
tables are great for summarizing particular values in a data list or database 
because they do their magic without making you create formulas to perform 
the calculations. Unlike the Subtotals feature, which is another summarizing 
feature (see Book VI, Chapter 1 for more information), pivot tables let you 
play around with the arrangement of the summarized data — even after you 
generate the table. (The Subtotals feature only lets you hide and display dif-
ferent levels of totals in the list.) This capability to change the arrangement 
of the summarized data by rotating row and column headings gives the 
pivot table its name.
Pivot tables are also versatile because they enable you to summarize data 
by using a variety of summary functions (although totals created with the 
SUM function will probably remain your old standby). When setting up the 
original pivot table — made really simple with the help of the PivotTable 
and PivotChart Wizard — you make several decisions: what summary func-
tion to use, which columns (fields) the summary function is applied to, and 
which columns (fields) these computations are tabulated with. You can 
also use pivot tables to cross-tabulate one set of data in your data list with 
another. For example, you can use this feature to create a pivot table from 
an employee database that totals the salaries for each job category cross-
tabulated (arranged) by department or job site.
Creating Pivot Tables
To create a new pivot table, simply open the worksheet that contains the 
data list (see Book VI, Chapter 1) you want summarized by the pivot table, 

662
Creating Pivot Tables
position the cell cursor somewhere in the cells of this list, and then click the 
PivotTable command button on the Ribbon’s Insert tab or press Alt+NVT.
Excel then selects all the data in the list indicated by a marquee around the 
cell range. The program also opens the Create PivotTable dialog box shown 
in Figure 2-1. You can then adjust the cell range in the Table/Range text box 
under the Select a Table or Range option button, if the marquee does not 
include all the data to be summarized in the pivot table. By default, Excel 
builds the new pivot table on a new worksheet it adds to the workbook. If 
you want the pivot table to appear on the same worksheet, click the Existing 
Worksheet option button and then indicate the location of the first cell of 
the new table in the Location text box. (Just be sure that this new pivot table 
isn’t going to overlap any existing tables of data.)
 
Figure 2-1: 
Indicate 
the data 
source and 
pivot table 
location in 
the Create 
PivotTable 
dialog box.  
 
If the data source for your pivot table is an external database table created 
with a separate database management program such as Microsoft Access, 
you need to click the Use an External Data Source option button, click the 
Choose Connection button, and then click the name of the connection in the 
Existing Connections dialog box. (See Book VI, Chapter 2 for information on 
establishing a connection with an external database table and retrieving its 
data through a query.)
After you indicate the source and location for the new pivot table in the 
Create PivotTable dialog box and click its OK button, the program adds a 
placeholder graphic (with the text, “To build a report, choose fields from 
the PivotTable Field List”) indicating where the new pivot table will go in 
the worksheet while at the same time displaying a PivotTable Field List task 
pane on the right side of the Worksheet area (see Figure 2-2).
This PivotTable Field List task pane is divided into two areas: the Choose 
Fields to Add to Report list box with the names of all the fields in the data 
list you selected as the source of the table preceded by an empty check box 
at the top and an area divided into four drop zones (Report Filter, Column 
Labels, Row Labels, and Values) at the bottom.

To complete the new pivot table, all you have to do is assign the fields in the 
PivotTable Field List task pane to the various parts of the table. You do this 
by dragging a field name from the Choose Fields to Add to Report list box 
to one of the four areas (or drop zones) in the Drag Fields Between Areas 
Below section at the bottom of the task pane:
 
✦ Report Filter for the fields that enable you to page through the data 
summaries shown in the actual pivot table by filtering out sets of data — 
they act as the filters for the report. So, for example, if you designate the 
Year Field from a data list as a Report Filter, you can display data sum-
maries in the pivot table for individual years or for all years represented 
in the data list.
 
✦ Column Labels for the fields that determine the arrangement of data 
shown in the columns of the pivot table — their entries appear in the 
table’s column headings.
 
✦ Row Labels for the fields that determine the arrangement of data shown 
in the rows of the pivot table — their entries appear in the table’s row 
headings.
 
✦ Values for the fields whose data are presented in the cells in the body 
of the pivot table — they are the values that are summarized in the last 
row and column of the table (totaled by default).

664
Creating Pivot Tables
To better understand how you can use these various areas in a pivot table, 
look at the complete pivot table in Figure 2-3. For this pivot table, I dragged 
these fields in the employee data list to the following drop zones in the Drag 
Fields between Areas Below section in the PivotTable Field List task pane:
 
✦ Gender field contains F (for female) or M (for male) to indicate the 
employee’s gender — to the Report Filter drop zone.
 
✦ Dept field contains the names of the various departments in the 
company — to the Column Labels drop zone.
 
✦ Location field contains the names of the various cities with corporate 
offices — to the Row Labels drop zone.
 
✦ Salary field contains the annual salary for each employee — to the 
Values zone.
As a result, this pivot table now displays the sum of the salaries for both the 
men and women employees in each department (across the columns) and 
then presents these sums by their corporate location (in each row).

✦ Field List to hide and redisplay the Pivot Table Field List task pane on 
the right side of the Worksheet area
 
✦ +/– to hide and redisplay the expand (+) and collapse (–) buttons in

Changing the PivotTable Field List 
task pane display
By default, Excel displays the list of fields on top 
of the four drop zones — Report Filter, Column 
Labels, Row Labels, and Values — in the 
PivotTable Field List task pane. You can change 
this arrangement by clicking the Fields Section 
and Areas Section Stacked drop-down button 
(to the immediate right of the Choose Fields to 
Add to Report heading) and then clicking one of 
the following options on its drop-down menu: 
Fields Section and Areas Section Side-by-Side 
to place the list of fields in a column to the left 
of the four drop zones, Fields Section Only to 
list only the fields, Areas Section Zones Only (2

or Areas Section Zones Only (1 by 4) to list only 
the drop zones in one column.
When you display only the four areas or drop 
zones in the PivotTable Field List task pane, you 
can click the drop-down buttons that appear to 
the right of the name of each field you add to 
the four areas to manipulate the fields: Move 
to Report Filter to move the field to the Report

Refining the pivot table layout and style
After selecting a style from the PivotTable Styles gallery on the Design tab 
on the PivotTable Tools contextual tab, you can then refine the style using 
the command buttons in the Layout group and the check boxes in the 
PivotTable Style Options group.
The Layout group on the Design tab contains the following four command 
buttons:
 
✦ Subtotals to hide the display of subtotals in the summary report or have 
them displayed at the top or bottom of their groups in the report.
 
✦ Grand Totals to turn on or off the display of grand totals in the last row 
or column of the report.
 
✦ Report Layout to modify the display of the report by selecting between 
the default Compact Form and the much more spread-out Outline Form 
(which connects the subtotals across the columns of the table with lines 
or shading depending on the table style selected) and Tabular Form 
(which connects the row items in the first column and the subtotals 
across the columns of the table with gridlines or shading depending on 
the table style selected).
 
✦ Blank Rows to insert or remove a blank row after each item in the table.
The PivotTable Style Options group contains the following four check boxes:
 
✦ Row Headers to remove and then re-add the font and color formatting 
from the row headers of the table in the first column of the table applied 
by the currently selected pivot table style.
 
✦ Column Headers to remove and then re-add the font and color format-
ting from the column headers at the top of the table applied by the cur-
rently selected pivot table style.
 
✦ Banded Rows to add and remove banding in the form of gridlines or 
shading (depending on the currently selected pivot table style) from the 
rows of the pivot table.
 
✦ Banded Columns to add and remove banding in the form of gridlines or 
shading (depending on the currently selected pivot table style) from the 
columns of the pivot table.
Figure 2-5 shows the original pivot table created from the employee data list 
after closing the PivotTable Field List task pane, adding the Years of Service 
field as a second row field, selecting the Show in Outline Form option on 
the Report Layout command button’s drop-down menu and the Insert Blank 
after Each Item option on the Blank Rows command button’s drop-down 
menu. Also, the subtotals of the salaries for each department now appear at 
the bottom of the location group rather than at the top after selecting the 
Show All Subtotals as Bottom of Group option on the Subtotals command 
button’s drop-down menu.

Formatting the parts of the pivot table
Even after applying a table style to your new pivot table, you may still want 
to make some individual adjustments to its formatting, such as selecting 
a new font, font size, or cell alignment for the text of the table and a new 
number format for the values in the table’s data cells.
You can make these types of formatting changes to a pivot table by selecting 
the part of the table to which the formatting is to be applied and then select-
ing the new formatting from the appropriate command buttons in the Font, 
Alignment, and Number groups on the Home tab of the Ribbon.
Applying a new font, font size, or alignment to the pivot table
You can modify the text in a pivot table by selecting a new font, font size, or 
horizontal alignment. To make these formatting changes to the text in the 
entire table, select the entire table before you use the appropriate command 
buttons in the Font and/or Alignment group on the Home tab. To apply these 
changes only to the headings in the pivot table, select only its labels before 
using the commands on the Home tab. To apply these changes only to the 
data in the body of the pivot table, select only its cells.
To help you select the cells you want to format in a pivot table, use the fol-
lowing Select items on the Options command button’s drop-down list:

Formatting a Pivot Table
 
1. Click a cell in the pivot table in the worksheet and then click the 
Options tab on the PivotTable Tools contextual tab.
 
2. Click the Select command button in the Actions group on the 
Options tab.
 
 Excel displays the Select submenu.
 
3. On the Select submenu, you can do the following:
 
• Click the Label and Values option to select the cells with the row and 
column headings and those with the values in the table.
 
• Click the Values option to select only the cells with values in the 
table.
 
• Click the Label option to select only the cells with the rows and 
column headings in the table.
 
• Click the Entire Table option on the Select submenu to select all the 
pivot table cells including the Report Filter cells.
 
You can also use the following hot keys to select all or part of your pivot 
table:
 
✦ Alt+JTWA to select the label cells with the row and column headings as 
well as the data cells with the values in the body of the pivot table
 
✦ Alt+JTWD to select only the data cells with the values in the body of the 
pivot table
 
✦ Alt+JTWL to select only the label cells with the row and column head-
ings in the pivot table
 
✦ Alt+JTWE to select the entire table, that is, all the cells of the pivot table 
including those with the Report Filter
 
You can only use the Label and Values, Values, and Labels select options on 
the Select button’s drop-down menu and their hot key equivalents after you 
have selected the Entire Table option to select all the cells.
 
Use Live Preview to preview the look of a new font or font size on the Font or 
Font Size drop-down menu in the Font group on the Ribbon’s Home tab.
Applying a number format to the data cells
When you first create a pivot table, Excel does not format the data cells in 
the table that contain the values corresponding to the field or fields you add 
to the Values drop zone in the PivotTable Field List task pane and the subto-
tals and grand totals that Excel adds to the table. You can, however, assign 
any of the Excel number formats to the values in the pivot table in one of 
two manners.

670
Sorting and Filtering the Pivot Table Data
In the first method, you select the entire table (Alt+JTWE), then select only 
its data cells in the body of the pivot table (Alt+JTWD), and then apply the 
desired number format using the command buttons in the Number group of 
the Home tab of the Ribbon. For example, to format the data cells with the 
Accounting number format with no decimal places, you click the Accounting 
Number Format command button and then click the Decrease Decimal com-
mand button two times.
You can also apply a number format to the data cells in the body of the pivot 
table by following these steps:
 
1. Click the name of the field in the table that contains the words “Sum 
of” and then click the Field Settings option on the Active Field drop-
down menu to open the Summarize Values By tab of the Value Field 
Settings dialog box.
 
 In my Employee example pivot table, this field is called Sum of Salary 
because the Salary field is summarized. Note that this field is located at 
the intersection of the Column and Row Label fields in the table.
 
2. Click the Number Format button in the Value Field Settings dialog box 
to open the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box.
 
3. Click the type of number format you want to assign to the values in 
the pivot table on the Category list box of the Number tab.
 
4. (Optional) Modify any other options for the selected number format 
such as Decimal Places, Symbol, and Negative Numbers that are avail-
able for that format.
 
5. Click OK twice — the first time to close the Format Cells dialog box 
and the second to close the Value Field Settings dialog box.
Sorting and Filtering the Pivot Table Data
When you create a new pivot table, you’ll notice that Excel automatically 
adds AutoFilter buttons to the Report Filter field as well as the labels for the 
Column and Row fields. These AutoFilter buttons enable you to filter out all 
but certain entries in any of these fields, and in the case of the Column and 
Row fields, to sort their entries in the table.
When you add more than one Column or Row field to your pivot table, Excel 
adds collapse buttons (–) that you can use to temporarily hide subtotal 
values for a particular secondary field. After clicking a collapse button in 
the table, it immediately becomes an expand button (+) that you can click to 
redisplay the subtotals for that one secondary field.

Book VII
Chapter 2

Sorting and Filtering the Pivot Table Data
Filtering the report
Perhaps the most important AutoFilter buttons in a pivot table are the ones 
added to the Report Filter field(s). By selecting a particular option on the 
drop-down lists attached to one of these AutoFilter buttons, only the sum-
mary data for that subset you select is then displayed in the pivot table 
itself.
For example, in the example pivot table (Figure 2-3) that uses the Gender field 
from the employee data list as the Report Filter field, you can display the sum 
of just the men’s salaries by department and location in the body of the pivot 
table simply by clicking the Gender field’s filter button and then clicking M on 
the drop-down list before you click OK. Likewise, you can view the summary 
of the women’s salaries by selecting F on this filter button’s drop-down list — 
to later redisplay the summary of the salaries for all the employees, you then 
reselect the (All) option on this list before you click OK.
Excel then displays M in the Gender Report Filter field instead of the default 
(All) and replaces the standard drop-down button icon with a cone-shaped 
filter icon, indicating that the field is currently being filtered to show only 
some of the values in the data source.
Filtering individual Column and Row fields
The AutoFilter buttons on the Column and Row fields enable you to filter 
particular groups and, in some cases, individual entries in the data source. 
To filter the summary data in the columns or rows of a pivot table, click the 
Column or Row field’s filter button and start by clicking the check box for 
the (Select All) option at the top of the drop-down list to clear this box of 
its check mark. Then, click the check boxes for all the groups or individual 
entries whose summed values you still want displayed in the pivot table to 
put back check marks in each of their check boxes before you click OK.
As when filtering a Report Filter field in the table, Excel replaces the stan-
dard drop-down button icon displayed in the particular Column or Report 
field with a cone-shaped filter icon. This icon indicates that the field is cur-
rently being filtered and only some of its summary values are now displayed 
in the pivot table. To redisplay all the values for a filtered Column or Report 
field, you need to click its filter button and then click (Select All) at the top 
of its drop-down list before you click OK.
Figure 2-6 shows the sample pivot table after filtering its Gender Filter 
Report Field to women by selecting F (for Female) and its Dept Column Field 
to Accounting, Administration, and Human Resources.

Sorting and Filtering the Pivot Table Data
 
Figure 2-6:

Notice in Figure 2-6 that after filtering the pivot table by selecting F in the 
Gender Filter Report field and selecting Accounting, Administration, and 
Human Resources departments as the only Dept Column fields, the filtered 
pivot table no longer displays salary summaries for all of the company’s 
locations (Santa Rosa, Seattle, and Atlanta locations are missing). You can 
tell that the table is missing these locations because there are no women 
employees in the three selected departments and not as a result of filtering 
the Row field because the Location drop-down button still uses the standard 
icon and not the cone filter icon now shown to the right of the Gender Filter 
Report and Dept Column fields.
Slicing the pivot table data
Excel 2010 introduces a new, graphic tool for filtering the data in your pivot 
table. Instead of having to filter the data using the check boxes attached to 
an item list on the drop-down menus on a field’s AutoFilter button, you can 
use slicers instead. Slicers, which float as graphic objects over the work-
sheet, not only enable you to quickly filter the data in particular fields of a 
pivot table, but also enable you to connect slicers to multiple pivot tables or 
to a pivot table and a pivot chart you’ve created.
To use slicers on a pivot table, click one of the table’s cells and then click 
the Insert Slicer button in the Sort & Filter group of the table’s Options tab. 
Excel then displays a drop-down menu with two options: Insert Slicer and 
Slicer Connections. When you select Insert Slicer, Excel displays an Insert 
Slicers dialog box like the one shown in Figure 2-7.
The Insert Slicers dialog box contains a list of all the fields in the current 
pivot table. You then select the check boxes for all the fields you want to 
filter the pivot table for before you select OK.

Book VII
Chapter 2

673
Sorting and Filtering the Pivot Table Data
 
Figure 2-7: 
Selecting 
the fields 
to use in 
filtering the

data with 
slicers.
 
Excel then displays a slicer for each field you select in the Insert Slicers 
dialog box. Each slicer appears as a rectangular graphic object that contains 
buttons for each entry in the particular pivot table field. You can then filter 
the data in the pivot table simply by clicking the individual entries in the 
slicer for all the values you still want displayed in table. To display values 
for multiple, nonconsecutive entries in a particular field, you hold down the 
Ctrl key as you click entries in its slicer. To display values of multiple con-
secutive values, you click the first entry in its slicer and then hold the Shift 
key as you click the last entry you want included.
Figure 2-8 shows you the pivot table for the employee data list after I used 
three slicers to filter it. The first slicer is for the Gender field, where I 
selected M so that only the records for the men are displayed in the pivot 
table. The second slicer is for the Dept field where I clicked the Engineering 
item to display only the men’s salaries in Engineering. The third and final 
slicer is for the Location field where I selected both the San Francisco and 
Seattle locations. As a result, the employee data pivot table is now filtered 
so that you see only the salary totals for the men in the Engineering depart-
ments at the San Francisco and Seattle offices.
 
Because slicers are graphic objects, when you add them to your worksheet, 
the program automatically adds a Slicer Tools Options contextual tab to the 
Ribbon. This Options tab contains many of the same graphic controls that 
you’re used to when dealing with standard graphic objects such as shapes 
and text boxes, including a Slicer Styles drop-down gallery, Shape Fill, Shape 
Outline and Shape Effects buttons, and Bring Forward, Send Back, and 
Selection Pane that you can use to format the currently selected slicer. You 
can also use the Height and Width options in the Buttons and Size groups 
to modify the dimensions of the slicer and the buttons it contains. Finally, 
you can use the PivotTable Connections command button to open the 
PivotTable Connections dialog box where you can connect additional pivot 
tables to the currently selected slicer.

To move a slicer, you click it to select it and then drag it from somewhere on 
its border using the black-cross pointer with an arrowhead. To deselect the 
items you’ve selected in a slicer, click the button in the upper-right corner of 
the slicer with a red x through the filter icon. To get rid of a slicer (and auto-
matically redisplay the PivotTable Field List task pane), select the slicer and 
then press the Delete key.
Sorting the pivot table
You can instantly reorder the summary values in a pivot table by sorting the 
table on one or more of its Column or Row fields. To re-sort a pivot table, 
click the AutoFilter button for the Column or Row field you want to use in 
the sort and then click either the Sort A to Z option or the Sort Z to A option 
at the top of the field’s drop-down list.
Click the Sort A to Z option when you want the table reordered by sorting 
the labels in the selected field alphabetically, or, in the case of values, from 
the smallest to largest value, or, in the case of dates, from the oldest to 
newest date. Click the Sort Z to A option when you want the table reordered 
by sorting the labels in reverse alphabetical order (Z to A), values from the 
highest to smallest, and dates from the newest to oldest.

Modifying the Pivot Table
Modifying the Pivot Table
As the name pivot implies, the fun of pivot tables is being able to rotate the 
data fields by using the rows and columns of the table, as well as to change 
what fields are used on the fly. For example, suppose that after making the 
Dept Field the pivot table’s Column Field, and the Location Field the Row 
Field, you now want to see what the table looks like with the Location Field 
as the Column Field and the Dept Field as the Row Field? 
No problem: All you have to do is open the PivotTable Field List task pane 
(Alt+JTL) and then drag Dept from the Column Labels drop zone to the Row 
Labels drop zone and then drag Location from the Row Labels drop zone to 
the Column Labels drop zone. Voilà — Excel rearranges the totaled salaries 
so that the rows of the pivot table show the departmental grand totals and 
the columns now show the location grand totals. Figure 2-9 shows this new 
arrangement for the pivot table.
 
Figure 2-9: 
Pivoting the 
table so that 
Location 
is now the 
Column 
Field and 
Dept the 
Row Field.
 
In fact, when pivoting a pivot table, not only can you rotate existing fields, 
but you can also add new fields to the table or assign more fields to the 
table’s Column Field and Row Field areas.

676
Modifying the Pivot Table
Figure 2-10 illustrates this situation. This figure shows the same pivot table 
after making a couple of key changes to the table structure. First, I added 
the Profit Sharing Field as a second Report Filter Field by dragging it to the 
Report Filter drop zone in the PivotTable Field List task pane. Then, I made 
Location a second Row Field by dragging it from the Column Labels drop 
zone to the Row Labels drop zone. Finally, for this figure, I changed the set-
ting in the Gender Report Filter from the default of All to M and changed the 
Profit Sharing Report Filter to Yes.
As a result, the modified pivot table shown in Figure 2-8 now shows the 
salary totals for all the men in the corporation arranged first by their loca-
tion and then by their department. Because I added Profit Sharing as a 
second Report Filter, I can see the totals for just the men or just the women 
who are or aren’t currently enrolled in the profit sharing plan simply by 
selecting the appropriate Report Filter settings.

Changing the summary functions
By default, Excel uses the good old SUM function to total the values in the 
numeric field(s) that you add to the Values drop zone, thereby assigning 
them to the data cells in the body of the pivot table. Some data summaries 
require the use of another summary function, such as the AVERAGE or 
COUNT function.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Generating Pivot 
Tables
677
Modifying the Pivot Table
To change the summary function that Excel uses, you open the Field Settings 
dialog box for one of the fields that you use as the data items in the pivot 
table. You can do this either by clicking the Value Field Settings option on 
the field’s drop-down menu in the Values drop zone in the PivotTable Field 
List task pane (Alt+JTL) or by right-clicking the field’s label and then select-
ing Value Field Settings on its shortcut menu.
After you open the Value Field Settings dialog box for the field, you can 
change its summary function from the default Sum to any of the following 
functions by selecting it on the Summarize By tab:
 
✦ Count to show the count of the records for a particular category (note 
that COUNT is the default setting for any text fields that you use as Data 
Items in a pivot table)
 
✦ Average to calculate the average (that is, the arithmetic mean) for the 
values in the field for the current category and page filter
 
✦ Max to display the largest numeric value in that field for the current cat-
egory and page filter
 
✦ Min to display the smallest numeric value in that field for the current 
category and page filter
 
✦ Product to display the product of the numeric values in that field for the 
current category and page filter (all non-numeric entries are ignored)
 
✦ Count Numbers to display the number of numeric values in that field 
for the current category and page filter (all non-numeric entries are 
ignored)
 
✦ StdDev to display the standard deviation for the sample in that field for 
the current category and page filter
 
✦ StdDevp to display the standard deviation for the population in that 
field for the current category and page filter
 
✦ Var to display the variance for the sample in that field for the current 
category and page filter
 
✦ Varp to display the variance for the population in that field for the cur-
rent category and page filter
After you select the new summary function to use on the Summarize By 
tab of the Value Field Settings dialog box, click the OK button to have Excel 
apply the new function to the data presented in the body of the pivot table.
Adding Calculated Fields
In addition to using various summary functions on the data presented in 
your pivot table, you can create your own Calculated Fields for the pivot 

678
Modifying the Pivot Table
table. Calculated Fields are computed by a formula that you create by using 
existing numeric fields in the data source. To create a Calculated Field for 
your pivot table, follow these steps:
 
1. Click any of the cells in the pivot table and then click the Calculated 
Field option on the Fields, Items, & Sets button’s drop-down list.
 
 The Fields, Items, & Sets command button is located in the Calculations 
group on the PivotTable’s Options tab.
 
 Excel opens the Insert Calculated Field dialog box similar to the one 
shown in Figure 2-11. Note that you can also open this dialog box by 
pressing Alt+JTJF when any one of the cells in the pivot table is selected.
 
2. Enter the name for the new field in the Name text box.
 
 Next, you create the formula in the Formula text box by using one or 
more of the existing fields displayed in the Fields list box.
 
3. Click the Formula text box and then delete the zero (0) after the equal 
sign and position the insertion point immediately following the equal 
sign (=).
 
 Now you’re ready to type in the formula that performs the calculation. 
To do this, insert numeric fields from the Fields list box and indicate the 
operation to perform on them with the appropriate arithmetic operators 
(+, -, *, or /).
 
4. Enter the formula to perform the new field’s calculation in the 
Formula text box, inserting whatever fields you need by clicking the 
name in the Fields list box and then clicking the Insert Field button.
 
 For example, in Figure 2-11, I created a formula for the new calculated 
field called Bonuses that multiplies the values in the Salary Field by 
2.5 percent (0.025) to compute the total amount of annual bonuses to 
be paid. To do this, I clicked the Salary field in the Fields list box and 
then clicked the Insert Field button to add Salary to the formula in the 
Formula text box (as in =Salary). Then, I typed *0.025 to complete the 
formula (=Salary*0.025).
 
 When you finish entering the formula for your calculated field, you can 
add the calculated field to the PivotTable Field List task pane by clicking 
the Add button. After you click the Add button, it changes to a grayed-
out Modify button. If you start editing the formula in the Formula text 
box, the Modify button becomes active so that you can click it to update 
the definition.
 
5. Click OK in the Insert Calculated Field dialog box.
 
 This action closes the Insert Calculated Field dialog box and adds the 
summary of the data in the calculated field to your pivot table.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Generating Pivot 
Tables
679
Modifying the Pivot Table
 
Figure 2-11: 
Creating a 
calculated 
field for a 
pivot table.
 
After you finish defining a calculated field to a pivot table, Excel automati-
cally adds its name to the field list in the PivotTable Field List task pane and 
to the Values drop zone thereby assigning the calculated field as another 
Data item in the body of the pivot table.
 
If you want to temporarily hide a calculated field from the body of the pivot 
table, click the name of the calculated field in the field list in the PivotTable 
Field List task pane (Alt+JTL) to remove the check mark from its check box 
in the field list. Then, when you’re ready to redisplay the calculated field, 
you can do so by clicking its check box in the field list in the PivotTable Field 
List task pane again to put a check mark back into it.
Changing the pivot table options
You can use the PivotTable Options dialog box (shown in Figure 2-12) to 
change the settings applied to any and all pivot tables that you create in 
a workbook. You open this dialog box by clicking the Options command 
button in the PivotTable Options group of the Options tab on the PivotTable 
Tools contextual tab or by pressing Alt+JTTT.

680
Creating Pivot Charts
The PivotTable Options dialog box contains the following six tabs:
 
✦ Layout & Format with options for controlling the various aspects of the 
layout and formatting of the cells in the pivot table.
 
✦ Totals & Filters with options for controlling the display of the subtotals 
and grand totals in the report, and filtering and sorting the table’s fields.
 
✦ Display with options for controlling the display items in the table and 
the sorting of the fields in the PivotTable.
 
✦ Printing with options for controlling print expand and collapse but-
tons when displayed in the pivot table, and print titles with the row and 
column labels on each page of the printout.
 
✦ Data with options for controlling how the data that supports the pivot 
table is stored and refreshed.
 
✦ Alt Text with options for adding alternate, text-based titles and descrip-
tions of the information in the pivot table for those with vision impair-
ments who then hear the title and description read aloud.
 
Perhaps the most important pivot table option is the Classic PivotTable 
Layout (Enables Dragging of Fields in the Grid) check box option on the 
Display tab. When you put a check mark in this check box, Excel lets you 
rearrange the fields within the pivot table simply by dragging their icons on 
the desired part of the table (Table Filter, Column Labels, or Row Labels). 
The program also lets you add fields to the pivot table by dragging them 
from the field list in the PivotTable Field List task pane and dropping them 
on the part of the table to which they are to be added.
Creating Pivot Charts
Instead of generating just a plain old boring pivot table, you can spice up 
your data summaries quite a bit by generating a pivot chart to go along 
with a supporting pivot table. To create a pivot chart from your pivot table, 
simply follow these two steps:
 
1. Click the PivotChart command button in the Tools group on the 
Options button attached to the PivotTable Tools contextual tab to 
open the Create Chart dialog box or press Alt+JCTC.
 
 Excel opens the Insert Chart dialog box where you can select the type and 
subtype of the pivot chart you want to create (see Book V, Chapter 1).
 
2. Click the thumbnail of the subtype of chart you want to create in the 
Insert Chart dialog box and then click OK.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Generating Pivot 
Tables
681
Creating Pivot Charts
As soon as you click OK after selecting the chart subtype, Excel inserts an 
embedded pivot chart into the worksheet containing the original pivot table. 
This new pivot chart contains drop-down buttons for each of the four differ-
ent types of fields used in the pivot chart (Report Filter, Legend Fields, Axis 
Fields, and Values). You can use these drop-down buttons to sort and filter 
the data represented in the chart (see “Filtering a pivot chart” later in this 
chapter for details).
In addition, Excel replaces the PivotTable Tools on the Ribbon with a 
PivotChart Tools contextual tab. This PivotChart Tools tab is then further 
subdivided into four tabs: Design, Layout, Format, and Analyze.
Moving a pivot chart to its own sheet
Although Excel automatically creates all new pivot charts on the same work-
sheet as the pivot table, you may find customizing and working with the 
pivot chart easier if you move the chart to its own chart sheet in the work-
book. To move a new pivot chart to its own chart sheet in the workbook, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Design tab under the PivotChart Tools contextual tab to 
bring its tools to the Ribbon and then click the Move Chart command 
button or press Alt+JCM.
 
 Excel opens the Move Chart dialog box.
 
2. Click the New Sheet option button in the Move Chart dialog box.
 
3. (Optional) Rename the generic Chart1 sheet name in the accompany-
ing text box by entering a more descriptive name there.
 
4. Click OK to close the Move Chart dialog box and open the new chart 
sheet with your pivot chart.
Figure 2-13 shows a clustered column pivot chart after moving the chart to 
its own chart sheet in the workbook.
Filtering a pivot chart
When you graph the data in a pivot table using a typical chart type such as 
column, bar, or line that uses both an x- and y-axis, the Row labels in the 
pivot table appear along the x- or category-axis at the bottom of the chart 
and the Column labels in the pivot table become the data series that are 
delineated in the chart’s legend. The numbers in the Values field are repre-
sented on the y- or value-axis that goes up the left side of the chart.
When you generate a new pivot chart, Excel adds drop-down list buttons to 
each of the types of fields represented. You can then use these drop-down 

682
Creating Pivot Charts
buttons in the pivot chart itself to filter the charted data represented in this 
fashion like you do the values in the pivot table. Remove the check mark 
from the (Select All) or (All) option and then add a check mark to each of the 
fields you still want represented in the filtered pivot chart.
 
Figure 2-13: 
Clustered

sheet.
 
Click the following drop-down buttons to filter a different part of the pivot 
chart:
 
✦ Report Filter to filter which data series are represented in the pivot 
chart
 
✦ Axis Fields (Categories) to filter the categories that are charted along 
the x-axis at the bottom of the chart
 
✦ Legend Fields (Series) to filter the data series shown in columns, bars, 
or lines in the chart body and identified by the chart legend
 
✦ Report Filter to filter the values charted along the y-axis on the left side 
of the chart
Formatting a pivot chart
The command buttons on the Design, Layout, and Format tabs attached to 
the PivotChart Tools contextual tab make it easy to further format and cus-
tomize your pivot chart. Use the Design tab buttons to select a new chart 

Book VII
Chapter 2
Generating Pivot

683
Creating Pivot Charts
style for your pivot chart or even a brand-new chart type. Use the Layout tab 
buttons to further refine your pivot chart by adding chart titles, text boxes, 
and gridlines. Use the Format tab buttons to refine the look of any graphics 
you’ve added to the chart as well as select a new background color for your 
chart.
 
To get specific information on using the buttons on these tabs, see Book V, 
Chapter 1, which covers creating charts from regular worksheet data — the 
Chart Tools contextual tab that appears when you select a chart you’ve cre-
ated contains the same Design, Layout, and Format tabs with comparable 
command buttons.

acros enable you to automate almost any task that you can under-
take in Excel 2010. By using Excel’s macro recorder to record tasks 
that you perform routinely, you not only speed up the procedure consider-
ably (because Excel can play back your keystrokes and mouse actions much 
faster than you can perform them manually), but you are also assured that 
each step in the task is carried out the same way each and every time you 
perform the task.
Excel’s macro recorder records all the commands and keystrokes that you 
make in a language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is a 
special version of the BASIC programming language developed and refined 
by the good folks at Microsoft for use with all their Office application pro-
grams. You can then use Excel’s Visual Basic Editor to display and make 
changes to the macro’s VBA code.
In this chapter, you find out how to use Excel’s macro recorder to record, 
test, and play back macros that you use to automate repetitive tasks 
required when building and using your Excel worksheets and charts. In the 
next chapter, you find out how to use Excel’s Visual Basic Editor to debug 
and edit the macros that you record, as well as to create complex macros 
that run custom functions and set up and run custom Excel applications, 
complete with their own pull-down menus and dialog boxes.

You can create macros in one of two ways:
 
✦ Use Excel’s macro recorder to record your actions as you undertake 
them in a worksheet.
 
✦ Enter the instructions that you want followed in VBA code in the Visual 
Basic Editor.
Either way, Excel creates a special module sheet that holds the actions 
and instructions in your macro. The macro instructions in a macro module 
(whether recorded by Excel or written by you) are stored in the Visual Basic 
for Applications programming language.
You can then study the VBA code that the macro recorder creates and edit 
this code in the Visual Basic Editor, which you open by clicking the Visual 
Basic command button on the Developer tab (when this optional tab is dis-
played on the Ribbon) or by pressing Alt+F11.
Recording macros
With Excel’s macro recorder, you can create many of the utility-type macros 
that help you to perform the repetitive tasks necessary for creating and edit-
ing your worksheets and charts. When you turn on the macro recorder, the 
macro recorder records all your actions in the active worksheet or chart 
sheet as you make them. Note that the macro recorder doesn’t record the 
keystrokes or mouse actions that you take to accomplish an action — only 
the VBA code required to perform the action itself. This means that mistakes 
that you make while taking an action that you rectify won’t be recorded as 
part of the macro; for example, if you make a typing error and then edit it 
while the macro recorder is on, only the corrected entry shows up in the 
macro without the original mistakes and steps taken to remedy them.
The macros that you create with the macro recorder can be stored either 
as part of the current workbook, in a new workbook, or in a special, globally 
available Personal Macro Workbook named PERSONAL.XLSB that’s stored in 
a folder called XLSTART on your hard disk. When you record a macro as part 
of your Personal Macro Workbook, you can run that macro from any work-
book that you have open (this is because the PERSONAL.XLSB workbook is 
secretly opened whenever you launch Excel, and although it remains hidden, 
its macros are always available). When you record macros as part of the cur-
rent workbook or a new workbook, you can run those macros only when the 
workbook in which they were recorded is open in Excel.
When you create a macro with the macro recorder, you decide not only the 
workbook in which to store the macro but also what name and shortcut

Macro Basics
keystrokes to assign to the macro that you are creating. When assigning a 
name for your macro, use the same guidelines that you use when you assign 
a standard range name to a cell range in your worksheet. When assigning a 
shortcut keystroke to run the macro, you can assign
 
✦ The Ctrl key plus a letter from A to Z, as in Ctrl+Q
 
✦ Ctrl+Shift and a letter from A to Z, as in Ctrl+Shift+Q
You can’t, however, assign the Ctrl key plus a punctuation or number key 
(such as Ctrl+1 or Ctrl+/) to your macro.
The Ribbon’s View tab contains a Macros command button to which a drop-
down menu containing the following three options is attached:
 
✦ View Macros: Opens the Macro dialog box where you can select a macro 
to run or edit.
 
✦ Record Macro: Opens the Record Macro dialog box where you define 
the settings for your new macro and then start the macro recorder; this 
is the same as clicking the Record Macro button on the Status bar.
 
✦ Use Relative References: Uses relative cell addresses when recording 
a macro, making the macro more versatile by enabling you to run it in 
areas of a worksheet other than the ones originally used in the macro’s 
recording.
Excel 2010 also enables you to add a Developer tab to the Ribbon. This tab 
contains a Record Macro and Use Relative References button that you can 
use in recording your macros. To add the Developer tab to the Excel 2010 
Ribbon, you follow these two steps:
 
1. Click File➪Options or press Alt+FI.
 
 Excel opens the Excel Options dialog box.
 
2. Click the Customize Ribbon button in the Excel Options dialog box.
 
 Excel opens the Customize the Ribbon pane within the Excel Options 
dialog box.
 
3. Click the Developer check box in the Main Tabs list on the right side 
of the Customize the Ribbon pane in the Excel Options dialog box and 
then click OK.
When you turn on the macro recorder either by clicking the Record Macro 
options on the Macros drop-down button on the View tab (Alt+WMR) or 
clicking the Record Macro command button on the Developer tab (Alt+LR), 
the macro recorder records all your actions in the active worksheet or chart 
sheet as you make them.

690
Macro Basics
To see how easy it is to create a macro with the macro recorder, follow 
along with these steps for creating a macro that enters the company name in 
12-point, bold type and centers the company name across rows A through E 
with the Merge and Center feature:
 
1. Open the Excel workbook that contains the worksheet data or chart 
you want your macro to work with.
 
 If you’re building a macro that adds new data to a worksheet (as in this 
example), open a worksheet with plenty of blank cells in which to add 
the data. If you’re building a macro that needs to be in a particular cell 
when its steps are played back, put the cell cursor in that cell.
 
2. Click the Record Macro option on the Macros command button on the 
View tab or press Alt+WMR.
 
 The Record Macro dialog box opens, similar to the one shown in 
Figure 1-1, where you enter the macro name, define any keystroke 
shortcut, select the workbook in which to store the macro, and enter a 
description of the macro’s function.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Getting 
ready to 
record the 
Company_
Name 
macro in 
the Record 
Macro 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Replace the Macro1 temporary macro name by entering your name 
for the macro in the Macro Name text box.
 
 Remember that when naming a macro, you must not use spaces in the 
macro name and it must begin with a letter and not some number or 
punctuation symbol. For this example macro, you replace Macro1 in the 
Macro Name text box with the name Company_Name.
 
 Next, you can enter a letter between A and Z that acts like a shortcut key 
for running the macro when you press Ctrl followed by that letter key. 
Just remember that Excel has already assigned a number of Ctrl+letter 
keystroke shortcuts for doing common tasks, such as Ctrl+C for copy-
ing an item to the Clipboard and Ctrl+V for pasting an item from the 
Clipboard into the worksheet. If you assign the same keystrokes to the 
macro that you’re building, your macro’s shortcut keys override and, 
therefore, disable Excel’s ready-made shortcut keystrokes.

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Building and 
Running Macros
691
Macro Basics
 
4. (Optional) Click the Shortcut Key text box and then enter the letter of 
the alphabet that you want to assign to the macro.
 
 For this example macro, press Shift+C to assign Ctrl+Shift+C as the short-
cut keystroke (so as not to disable the ready-made Ctrl+C shortcut).
 
 Next, you need to decide where to save the new macro that you’re 
building. Select Personal Macro Workbook on the Store Macro In drop-
down list box to be able to run the macro anytime you like. Select This 
Workbook (the default) when you need to run the macro only when the 
current workbook is open. Select New Workbook if you want to open a 
new workbook in which to record and save the new macro.
 
5. Click the Personal Macro Workbook, New Workbook, or This 
Workbook item on the Store Macro In drop-down list to indicate 
where to store the new macro.
 
 For this example macro, select the Personal Macro Workbook so that 
you can use it to enter the company name in any Excel workbook that 
you create or edit.
 
 Now, you should document the purpose and functioning of your macro 
in the Description list box. Although this step is purely optional, it is a 
good idea to get in the habit of recording this information every time 
you build a new macro so that you and your coworkers can always know 
what to expect from the macro when any of you run it.
 
6. (Optional) Click the Description list box and then insert a brief 
description of the macro’s purpose in front of the information indicat-
ing the date and who recorded the macro.
 
 Now you’re ready to close the Record Macro dialog box and start 
recording your macro.
 
7. Click OK to close the Record Macro dialog box.
 
 When you do this, the Record Macro dialog box closes. The circular 
red icon on the Record Macro button both on the Status bar and the 
Developer tab changes into a square blue Stop Recording button.
 
 Click the Use Relative References option on the Macros command 
button on the View tab or the Use Relative References command button 
on the Developer tab (when it’s displayed) when you want the macro 
recorder to record the macro relative to the position of the current cell. 
Doing this often makes a macro more versatile as it enables you to run 
the macro in areas in the worksheet other than the cells used in its origi-
nal recording.
 
8. (Optional) Click the Use Relative References option on the Macros 
command button on the View tab (Alt+WMU) or click the Use Relative 
References command button on the Developer tab (Alt+LU) if you 
want to be able to play back the macro anywhere in the worksheet.

692
Macro Basics
 
9. Select the cells, enter the data, and choose the Excel commands 
required to perform the tasks that you want recorded just as you nor-
mally would in creating or editing the current worksheet, using either 
the keyboard or the mouse or a combination of the two.
 
 For the example macro, all you do is type the company name and click 
the Enter button on the Formula bar to complete the entry in the current 
cell. Next, click the Bold button and then click 12 on the Font Size drop-
down list on the Formatting toolbar. Finally, drag through cells A1:E1 to 
select this range and then click the Merge and Center button, again on 
the Formatting toolbar.
 
 After you finish taking all the actions in Excel that you want recorded 
(see Figure 1-2), you’re ready to shut off the macro recorder.
 
10. Click the Stop Recording button on the Status bar.
 
 The square blue Stop Recording button on the Status bar tab changes 
into a Record Macro button (with an icon that has a worksheet with a 
red dot in the corner). This lets you know that the macro recorder is 
now turned off and no further actions will be recorded. You can then 
click this Record Macro button that now appears on the Status bar to 
start recording another macro.
 
Figure 1-2:

Running a macro
After recording a macro, you can run it by doing any of the following:
 
✦ Click the View Macros option on the Macros command button on the 
View tab or press Alt+WMV.
 
✦ Click the Macros command button on the Developer tab of the Ribbon 
when it’s displayed or press Alt+LPM.
 
✦ Press Alt+F8.

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Building and 
Running Macros

Macro Basics
Excel then opens the Macro dialog box, which is similar to the one shown in 
Figure 1-3. As this figure shows, Excel lists the names of all the macros in the 
current workbook and in your Personal Macro Workbook (provided you’ve 
created one) in the Macro Name list box. Click the name of the macro that 
you want to play and click the Run button or press Enter.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Selecting 
the macro

the Macro 
dialog box.
 
If you assigned a shortcut keystroke to the macro, you don’t have to bother 
opening the Macro dialog box to play the macro: Simply press Ctrl plus the 
letter key or Ctrl+Shift plus the letter key that you assigned and Excel imme-
diately plays back all of the commands that you recorded.
 
Before testing a new macro, you may need to select a new worksheet, or at 
least a new cell range within the active worksheet. When recording cell refer-
ences in a macro, the macro recorder always inserts absolute references in 
the macro sheet unless you click the Relative Reference button on the Stop 
Recording toolbar before you start choosing the commands and taking the 
actions in the spreadsheet that you want recorded as part of the macro. 
This means that your macro enters its data entries or performs its format-
ting in the same area of the active worksheet (unless the code in the macro 
itself causes the macro to first select a new area or select a new sheet in the 
active workbook).
If you run your macro in a worksheet that already contains data in the cells 
that the macro uses, you run the risk of having existing data and/or format-
ting overwritten during the macro’s execution. Keep in mind that, although 
you can use the Undo feature to reverse the very last action performed by 
your macro, most macros perform a series of actions, so you may end up 
using multiple levels of Undo before you are able to successfully reconstruct 
your spreadsheet.

694
Macro Security
Macro Security
Excel 2010 uses a system called Microsoft Authenticode that enables devel-
opers to authenticate their macro projects or add-ins created with Visual 
Basic for Applications by a process referred to as digital signing. When you 
run a macro in your worksheet that’s not saved in the trusted locations on 
your computer, such as the Templates and XLSTART folder in your user area 
on the computer, Excel checks to see if the macro is digitally signed and that 
the signature is both valid and current. The macro’s developer must have 
a certificate issued by a reputable authority or is considered as a trusted 
publisher.
If the program cannot verify a macro’s digital signature (perhaps because 
it doesn’t have one) or the trustworthiness of its macro publisher, the pro-
gram then displays a security alert on the message bar underneath the Excel 
Ribbon. This alert area contains an Enable Content and a Trust Center com-
mand button. You can then click the Enable Content button to ignore the 
alert and go ahead and run the macro, assuming that you can vouch for the 
macro’s publisher and are sure that running the macro poses no security 
risk to your computer. You click the Trust Center command button in the 
security alert on the message bar to open the Trust Center dialog box where 
you can add to the trusted locations on your computer system and change 
the macro security settings.
 
You can also open the Macro Settings tab of the Trust Center dialog box by 
clicking the Macro Security command button on the Developer tab (Alt+LAS) 
or clicking the Trust Center Settings button on the Trust Center tab of the 
Excel Options dialog box (Alt+FIT) and then clicking Macro Settings in the 
dialog box’s Navigation pane.
By default, Excel selects the Disable All Macros with Notification option 
button on the Macro Settings tab of the Trust Center. When this setting is 
selected, all macros that are not saved in one of the trusted locations are 
automatically disabled in the worksheet, but you do get a security alert each 
time you try to run one of these macros that enables you to ignore the alert 
and go ahead and run the macro by clicking the Enable Content button.
The Macro Settings tab of the Trust Center dialog box also contains these 
other option buttons you can select:
 
✦ Disable All Macros without Notification to disable all macros not saved 
in one of your computer’s trusted locations and all security alerts so 
that you and the other users of the worksheet have no way to ignore the 
alert and run the macro. Select this option when you don’t trust some-
one else’s macros and want to make it impossible to run a macro carry-
ing a computer virus.

Assigning Macros to the Ribbon and the Quick Access Toolbar
 
✦ Disable All Macros with Notification (the default) to control the dis-
abling of macros not saved in one of your computer’s trusted locations 
and security alerts. When you select this setting, worksheet users can’t 
ignore the alert and run the macro. Select this option when you want to 
maintain control over running potentially untrustworthy macros.
 
✦ Disable All Macros except Digitally Signed Macros to automatically 
enable digitally signed macros from a publisher that you’ve indicated 
is trustworthy and to disable all macros that are not digitally signed 
without notification. When you select this option and try to run a 
digitally signed macro that’s not from a publisher you’ve indicated is 
trustworthy, Excel displays an alert in the message bar with a Trust 
All Documents from this Publisher button that you can select, thereby 
adding the publisher to the trusted list.
 
✦ Enable All Macros (Not Recommended; Potentially Dangerous Code 
Can Run) to throw all caution to the wind and allow all macros to run 
in any worksheet you open — this is one option you never ever want to 
select!
To change the trusted locations on your computer, you need to click the 
Trusted Locations tab in the Trust Center dialog box. You can then use these 
options to change the location settings:
 
✦ Add New Location: Use this command button to open the Microsoft 
Office Trusted Location dialog box where you select a new folder on 
your computer as a trusted location either by entering its directory path 
name in the Path text box or selecting it with the Browse button. Click 
the Subfolders of This Location Are Also Trusted check box to select it 
if you want all subfolders within the designated folder to be included as 
trusted locations.
 
✦ Allow Trusted Locations on My Network (Not Recommended): Select 
this check box so that you can designate folders to which you have 
access on your local network as trusted locations using the Add New 
Location command button (as described in the immediately preceding 
bullet point).
 
✦ Disable All Trusted Locations: Select this check box to immediately dis-
able all the folders currently designated as trusted locations and allow 
only macros from publishers designated as trustworthy to run in Excel.
Assigning Macros to the Ribbon 
and the Quick Access Toolbar
Instead of running a macro by selecting it in the Macro dialog box or by 
pressing shortcut keys you assign to it, you can assign the macro to a 

696
Assigning Macros to the Ribbon and the Quick Access Toolbar
custom tab on the Ribbon or a custom button on the Quick Access toolbar 
and then run it by clicking that custom button.
Adding your macros to a custom tab on the Ribbon
To assign a macro to a custom tab on the Excel 2010 Ribbon, you follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click File➪Options and then click the Custom Ribbon button in the 
Excel Options dialog box (or press Alt+FIC).
 
 Excel displays the Customize the Ribbon pane in the Excel Options 
dialog box.
 
2. Click Macros in the Choose Commands From drop-down list box on 
the left.
 
 Excel lists the names of the all the macros created in the current 
workbook and saved in the PERSONAL.XLSB workbook in the Choose 
Commands From list box.
 
3. Click the name of the custom group on the custom tab to which you 
want to add the macro in the Main Tabs list box on the right.
 
 If you haven’t already created a custom tab and group for the macro or 
need to create a new one, you then need to follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Tab button at the bottom of the Main Tabs list.
 
 Excel adds both a New Tab (Custom) and New Group (Custom) item 
to the Main Tabs list while at the same time selecting the New Group 
(Custom) item.
 
2. Click the New Tab (Custom) item you just added to the Main Tabs.
 
3. Click the Rename button at the bottom of the Main Tabs list box 
and then type a display name for the new custom tab before you 
click OK.
 
4. Click the New Group (Custom) item right below the custom tab you 
just renamed.
 
5. Click the Rename button and then type a display name for the new 
custom group before you click OK.
 
4. In the Choose Commands From list box on the left, click the name of 
the macro you want to add to the custom group now selected in the 
Main Tabs list box on the right.
 
5. Click the Add button to add the selected macro to the selected custom 
group on your custom tab and then click the OK button to close the 
Excel options dialog box.

697
Assigning Macros to the Ribbon and the Quick Access Toolbar
After you add a macro to the custom group of a custom ribbon tab, the name 
of the macro then appears on a button sporting a generic icon (a program-
ming diagram chart) when you select the custom tab on the Ribbon. All you 
have to do to run the macro is to click this macro command button.
Adding your macros to custom buttons 
on the Quick Access toolbar
To assign a macro to a custom button on the Quick Access toolbar, you 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button at the end of the 
Quick Access toolbar and then click More Commands on the drop-
down menu to open the Quick Access Toolbar tab of the Excel Options 
dialog box.
 
2. Click Macros in the Choose Commands From drop-down list box.
 
 Excel lists the names of the all the macros created in the current 
workbook and saved in the PERSONAL.XLSB workbook in the Choose 
Commands From list box.
 
3. Click the name of the macro to add to a custom button on the Quick 
Access toolbar in the Choose Commands From list box and then click 
the Add button.
 
4. Click OK to close the Excel Options dialog box.
After you close the Excel Options dialog box, a custom button with a generic 
macro icon (picturing a standard command flowchart icon) appears on the 
Quick Access toolbar. To see the name of the macro assigned to this custom 
macro button as a ScreenTip, position the mouse pointer over the button. 
To run the macro, click the button.
 
Keep in mind that you can also assign macros to the graphic objects you 
add to your worksheet, including shapes you draw, clip art, and pictures you 
import. To assign a macro to a graphic object, right-click it and then click 
the Assign Macro option on its shortcut menu. Then click the name of the 
recorded macro to run in the list box of the Assign Macro dialog box and 
click OK. Thereafter, when you position the mouse pointer over the graphic 
object, the pointer becomes a hand with a pointing index finger (just like 
when you assign a hyperlink to a graphic — see Book IV, Chapter 2), indicat-
ing that you can click it to run the macro.

In This Chapter
✓ Getting familiar with Visual Basic for Applications and the Visual Basic 
Editor
✓ Installing and using VBA help
✓ Editing a macro in the Visual Basic Editor
✓ Creating a dialog box that prompts you for input for your macro
✓ Writing new macros in the Visual Basic Editor
✓ Using VBA to create user-defined functions
✓ Using your user-defined functions in your spreadsheets
✓ Saving user-defined functions as Excel add-ins
T
he subject of this chapter is Visual Basic for Applications (usually 
known simply as VBA), which is the official programming language of 
Excel, and how you can use it to both edit the macros that you record (as 
described in Book VIII, Chapter 1) as well as to write new macros. The key 
to editing and writing macros in VBA is its editing program, the Visual Basic 
Editor (often abbreviated as VBE). The Visual Basic Editor offers a rich envi-
ronment for coding and debugging VBA code with an interface that rivals 
Excel itself in terms of features and complexity.
VBA is a huge subject, well beyond the scope of this book. In this chapter, 
I simply introduce you to the Visual Basic Editor, and I explain how to use 
it to do basic macro editing. I also show you how to use the Visual Basic 
Editor to create custom Excel functions that you can then use when building 
formulas in your Excel spreadsheets. Custom functions (also known as user-
defined functions or UDFs) work just like built-in functions except that they 
perform only the calculations that you define, by using just the arguments 
that you specify.
If this basic introduction to Visual Basic for Applications and using the 
Visual Basic Editor inspires you to go on and try your hand at real VBA 
project development in Excel, I recommend Excel 2010 VBA Programming 
For Dummies, by John Walkenbach (Mr. Spreadsheet, himself) and Jan Karel 
Pieterse (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.) as an excellent next step. 
Their book gives you the lowdown on all the ins and outs of VBA program-
ming in that old, familiar, down-home For Dummies style that you’ve come 
to know and love.

Using the Visual Basic Editor
Using the Visual Basic Editor
The first question that you may have is where the heck did they stick this 
Visual Basic Editor that you’ve heard so much about? Actually, the Visual 
Basic Editor is always ready to step forward whenever you press Alt+F11 or 
click the Visual Basic command button on the Developer tab or press Alt+LV 
when this optional tab is displayed on the Ribbon.
 
The Developer tab is not one of the permanent tabs on the Excel Ribbon. If 
your Ribbon doesn’t have a Developer tab, this just means that you haven’t 
yet added it to the Ribbon, something you definitely want to do when work-
ing with macros. To add the Developer tab, click the Developer check box 
in the Main Tabs list box on the Customize Ribbon tab of the Excel Options 
dialog box (Alt+FIC) to select it.
Figure 2-1 shows the arrangement of the typical components in the Visual 
Basic Editor after you first open its window and open a new module sheet. 
As you can see, this window contains its own menu bar (with a few more 
menus than the regular Excel window uses). Beneath the menu bar, you find 
a Visual Basic Editor Standard toolbar. This toolbar, shown in Figure 2-2, 
contains a number of buttons that you may use when creating and editing 
VBA code.

Beneath the Standard toolbar in the Visual Basic Editor, you find a number 
of tiled windows of various sizes and shapes. Keep in mind that these are 
the default windows. They aren’t the only windows that you can have open 
in the Visual Basic Editor (as though it weren’t crowded and confusing 
enough), nor is this the only way that they can be arranged.
The two most important windows (at least, when you’re first starting out 
using the Visual Basic Editor) are the Project Explorer window and the Code 
window. The Project Explorer window, which is located to the immediate 
left of the Code window (refer to Figure 2-1), shows you all the projects that 
you have open in the Visual Basic Editor and enables you to easily navigate 
their various parts. Note that in VBA, a project consists of all the code and 
user forms that belong to a particular workbook along with the sheets of the 
workbook itself.
The macros that you record in the workbook, as well as any that you write 
for it in the Visual Basic Editor, are recorded on module sheets to which 
generic names are assigned, such as Module1, Module2, and so forth. The 
actual lines of VBA programming code for the macro that are stored on a 
particular module sheet appear in the Code window when you select its 
module in the Project Explorer window (the Code window appears to the 
immediate right of the Project Explorer window).
To open a module in the Code window, double-click its module icon in the 
Project Explorer or right-click the module icon and then click View Code at 
the top of its shortcut menu.
 
If you want to rename a module in your VBA project to something a little 
more descriptive than Module1, Module2, and so on, you can do this in the 
Properties window that appears immediately below the Project Explorer. 
Simply click and drag through the name (such as Module1) that appears 
after the label (Name) on the Alphabetic tab in the Properties window and 
replace it with a more descriptive name before you press Enter. When 
renaming a module, remember that you must use the same naming guide-
lines as when naming a range name in a worksheet: Begin the module name 
with a letter of the alphabet and don’t put any spaces between words (use 
underlines instead).

702
Using the Visual Basic Editor
Getting VBA help
Given the richness of the Visual Basic for Applications language and the 
sophistication of the Visual Basic Editor, you definitely want to become 
well acquainted with VBA online help as you begin to use the language and 
its editor to modify and refine your recorded macros and develop custom 
applications of your own. The VBA Help system works just like Excel’s Help 
program (covered in Book I, Chapter 2).
You can get help using Visual Basic for Applications by choosing Help➪
Microsoft Visual Basic Help on the menu bar, pressing F1, or by clicking the 
Microsoft Visual Basic Help button that appears near the end of the toolbar. 
Excel then opens the Excel Help window with the Excel Developer Help and 
How-to section containing the following links: Getting Started, What’s New, 
Concepts, How Do I . . . in Excel 2010, Excel Object Model Reference, and 
Microsoft Graph Visual Basic Reference.
To get access to the topical information on Visual Basic, click one of the 
links in the Excel Developer Help and How-to section or click the Show Table 
of Contents button on the toolbar (the one with the closed book icon), and 
then click one of the books in the Navigation pane that appears on the left to 
expand its topics, and then click one of its topical links to get detailed help 
information.
You can also get help on a particular Visual Basic property by typing the 
command into the Search text box on the left side of the row immediately 
under the Help window’s toolbar, and then clicking the Search button or 
pressing the Enter key. The Visual Basic Editor responds by displaying a list 
containing that property and others related to it that you can then click to 
obtain detail usage information.
 
In the Code window, when you need help with a particular property that 
appears in a line of your macro’s VBA code, by far the best way to get help is 
to select the property with the I-beam mouse pointer and then click the Help 
button on the Standard toolbar or press F1. When you do this, the Visual 
Basic Editor opens an Excel Help window that lists the property. You can 
then click the link to display detailed information on the property including 
its syntax and examples of its usage.
By selecting unfamiliar statements in the code of the macros that you record 
and edit in the Visual Basic Editor and then opening a context-sensitive 
Excel Help window in this manner, you can quickly become familiar with the 
usage and syntax of the most commonly used statements and properties in 
the VBA language.

Editing recorded macros
After you’ve created a macro, you don’t necessarily have to re-record it to 
change the way it behaves. In many cases, you will find it more expedient to 
change its behavior by simply editing its contents in the Visual Basic Editor. 
Note that if the macro you want to edit is stored in your Personal Macro 
Workbook (that personal.xlsb file in the XLSTART folder — see Book VIII, 
Chapter 1 for details), you must unhide this workbook before you edit it in 
the Visual Basic Editor.
To unhide the Personal Macro Workbook, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Unhide command button on the Ribbon’s View tab or press 
Alt+WU.
 
 Excel opens the Unhide dialog box showing the workbook, PERSONALB, 
in its Unhide Workbook list box.
 
2. Click PERSONALB in the Unhide Workbook list box and then press 
Enter.
 
 This action makes the Personal Macro Workbook visible and activates it 
so that you can now edit its macros in the Visual Basic Editor.
To open a macro for editing in the Visual Basic Editor, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the View Macros option on the Macros command button on the 
View tab or press Alt+WMV or Alt+F8.
 
 This action opens the Macro dialog box showing all the names of the 
macros that you’ve defined in the workbook and in your Personal Macro 
Workbook.
 
2. Click the name of the macro that you want to edit in the Macro Name 
list box and then click the Edit button.
 
 This action opens the Visual Basic Editor with the code for your 
macro displayed in the Code window unless you select the name of a 
macro saved in the Personal Macro Workbook and this workbook is 
still hidden. In that case, Excel displays an Alert dialog box telling you 
that you can’t edit a hidden macro and informing you that you need to 
unhide this workbook. You then need to click OK in the Alert dialog box, 
press Escape to close the Macro dialog box, and then follow the steps 
for unhiding the Personal Macro Workbook immediately preceding these 
steps before you repeat these first two macro editing steps.
 
 After you have the lines of code for the macro displayed in the Code 
window in the Visual Basic Editor, you can edit any of its statements 
as needed. If you want to obtain a printout of the lines of code in your 

704
Using the Visual Basic Editor
macro before you begin making changes, choose File➪Print on the 
Visual Basic Editor menu bar or press Ctrl+P. This action opens a Print 
dialog box with the Current Module option button selected in the Range 
section and the Code check box selected in the Print What section so 
that you can go ahead and click OK to have Excel print all the state-
ments in the macro.
 
 When editing the macro’s commands, remember that you can use the 
Edit➪Undo (Ctrl+Z) command to undo any deletion that you make by 
mistake. Also, remember that you can find out what a particular state-
ment or property does in the macro by selecting it with the I-beam 
mouse pointer and pressing F1, or by clicking the Help button on the 
Standard toolbar to get help in the Help window.
 
3. Edit the statements in the Code window of the Visual Basic Editor as 
needed.
 
 After you finish editing the macro, you’re ready to return to your spread-
sheet where you can test out the modified macro and make sure that 
you haven’t added some wacky, unwanted command to the macro or, 
even worse, crippled it so that it no longer runs at all.
 
4. Click the View Microsoft Excel button at the beginning of the Standard 
toolbar or click the workbook’s minimized button on the Windows 
taskbar.
 
 Select an appropriate or safe place in which to test your modified macro 
and then run it, either by pressing its shortcut keys or by pressing 
Alt+F8, clicking it in the Macro list box, and then clicking the Run button.
 
 If something doesn’t work as intended or if the macro doesn’t work at 
all, you need to return to the Visual Basic Editor and find and correct 
your error(s). Click the Visual Basic command button on the Developer 
tab of the Ribbon (Alt+LV) to return to the Visual Basic Editor and have 
a try at editing the code one more time.
 
 If everything checks out and runs as planned, you need to save your 
changes as outlined in Step 5.
 
5. Click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar to save the changes 
to the modified macro if it’s stored as part of the current workbook.
 
 If you modified a global macro saved as part of the Personal Macro 
Workbook, you have to exit Excel in order to save your changes to the 
macro. When you click File➪Exit Excel or Alt+FX or Alt+F4, Excel dis-
plays an Alert dialog box asking if you want to save the changes you 
made to the personal.xlsb file. Click the Yes button to save your 
macro modifications as you close down Excel.

Book VIII
Chapter 2

705
Using the Visual Basic Editor
 
Keep in mind that Excel automatically hides the Personal Macro Workbook 
when you exit Excel if you don’t click the Hide command button on the View 
tab or press Alt+WH when the PERSONALSB workbook is active sometime 
before exiting the program. This means that you must remember to click the 
Unhide command button on the View tab (Alt+WU) and select this personal 
macro workbook in the Unhide dialog box to make it visible before the next 
time you launch Excel and need to edit any of its macros during any subse-
quent editing session.
Finding and replacing code in the macro
You can use the Find feature in the Visual Basic Editor to quickly locate the 
statements or properties that need editing in your macro. You open the Find 
dialog box, shown in Figure 2-3, by choosing Edit➪Find on the menu bar, 
clicking the Find button on the Standard toolbar, or by pressing Ctrl+F. This 
dialog box is very similar to the one you use when finding entries in your 
Excel spreadsheet. The main difference is that the Find dialog box gives you 
different choices for what to search for (in addition to the familiar options 
for finding whole words only and matching case):
 
✦ Current Procedure option button to search only the current program-
ming procedure in the Code window.
 
✦ Current Module option button to search only the macros in the current 
module (the default).
 
✦ Current Project option button to search all the macros in all modules 
within the current project.
 
✦ Selected Text option button to search only the text that you’ve selected 
in the Code window (this option is not available unless you’ve selected a 
block of text in the current code).
After you enter the Visual Basic property or statement as your search string 
in the Find What text box, select the search options, and click the Find Next 
button, Excel attempts to locate its first occurrence in the code. When it does, 
the program highlights that occurrence in the current procedure, module, 
VBA project, or selected text block (depending on which Search option you 
use). To find the next occurrence, you can click the Find Next button in the 
Find dialog box again, or, if you close this dialog box, by pressing F3.
If you have a number of occurrences throughout the macro that require the 
same type of updating, you can use the Replace feature to both find and 
replace them in the macro code. This is particularly useful when you decide 
to change a particular value throughout a macro (such as selecting the cell 
range named “income_08” for processing instead of the range “income_07”), 
and you want to make sure that you don’t miss any occurrences.

706
Using the Visual Basic Editor

in the Code 
window.
 
To open the Replace dialog box, choose Edit➪Replace on the Visual Basic 
Editor menu bar or press Ctrl+H. Note that you can open the Replace dialog 
box from within the Find dialog box by clicking its Replace button.
The Replace dialog box that appears is just like the Find dialog box, except 
that it contains a Replace With text box along with the Find What text box 
and has Replace and Replace All buttons in addition to the Find Next button. 
After entering the property or statement to find in the Find What text box 
and the one to replace it with in the Replace With text box, click the Find 
Next button to locate the first occurrence in the current procedure, module, 
VBA project, or selected text block (depending on which Search option 
you use). After this occurrence is selected in the Code window, you have 
it replaced with the replacement text by clicking the Replace button. Excel 
then locates the next occurrence, which you can then replace by clicking the 
Replace button or pass over to find the next occurrence by clicking the Find 
Next button.
 
Don’t use the Replace All button to replace all the occurrences in your 
macro unless you’re 100 percent sure that you won’t be globally replacing 
something that shouldn’t be replaced and possibly screwing up your macro 
big time. I once typed “selection.font.bold = ture” into the Replace 
With text box when I intended to enter “selection.font.bold = true” 

Book VIII
Chapter 2
VBA Programming
707
Using the Visual Basic Editor
as the replacement text when searching for the property “Selection.
Font.Bold = False” in the macro. I then clicked the Replace All button 
only to discover to my dismay that I introduced this error throughout the 
code! Of course, I then had to turn around and use the Replace feature to 
find all the instances of “selection.font.bold = ture” and replace 
them with “Selection.Font.Bold = true”.
Changing settings for VBA properties
Even when you don’t know anything about programming in VBA (and even 
if you aim to keep it that way), you can still get the gist of some of the more 
obvious properties in a macro that change certain settings, such as number 
format or font attribute, by experimenting with assigning them new values.
In the Company_Name macro shown previously in Figure 2-3, for example, 
you can tell that the section of VBA commands between the line
With Selection.Font
and the line
End With
contains the procedure for assigning various font attributes for the current 
cell selection.
Going a step further, you probably can figure out that most of these attri-
butes are being reset by making the attribute equal to a new entry or value, 
such as
.Name = “Calibri”
or
.Size = 12
or an attribute is being reset by turning it on or off by setting it equal to True 
or False, such as
FontStyle = Bold
to make the text in the current cell selection bold.
Now, it doesn’t require a programming degree (at least, not the last time I 
checked) to get the bright idea that you can make your macro behave differ-
ently just by — carefully — editing these settings. For example, suppose that 

708
Using the Visual Basic Editor
you want the final font size to be 24 points instead of 12. All you have to do 
is change
.Size = 12
to
.Size = 24
Likewise, you can have the macro apply single underlining to the cell selec-
tion by changing
.Underline = xlUnderlineStyleNone
to
.Underline = xlUnderlineStyleSingle
Many times, the alternate settings allowed in a particular Visual Basic code, 
such as the Underline property, are anything but obvious. (How’s that for an 
understatement?) When you encounter such a property in the macro code 
and you want to know what kinds of values it will accept, simply look it up 
in the online Visual Basic Reference. Click the property in the Code window 
without selecting its current setting (such as selecting Underline rather 
than selecting Underline = xlUnderlineStyleNone) and then Press F1 
to open the Excel Help window with links to information on that property. 
Usually the Example section at the bottom of this Help window gives you an 
idea of the different types of values that the property can take. Remember, 
too, that you can obtain a printout of this Help information by clicking the 
Print button on the Help window’s toolbar.
Getting macro input by adding a dialog box
One of the biggest problems with recording macros is that any text or values 
that you have the macro enter for you in a worksheet or chart sheet can 
never vary thereafter. If you create a macro that enters the heading “Bob’s 
Barbecue Pit” in the current cell of your worksheet, this is the only heading 
you’ll ever get out of that macro. However, you can get around this inflex-
ibility by using the InputBox function. When you run the macro, this Visual 
Basic function causes Excel to display an Input dialog box where you can 
enter whatever title makes sense for the new worksheet. The macro then 
puts that text into the current cell and formats this text, if that’s what you’ve 
trained your macro to do next.
To see how easy it is to use the InputBox function to add interactivity to an 
otherwise staid macro, follow the steps for converting the Company_Name 

Book VIII
Chapter 2
VBA Programming
709
Using the Visual Basic Editor
macro that currently inputs the text “Mind Over Media” to one that actually 
prompts you for the name that you want entered. The InputBox function 
uses the following syntax:
InputBox(prompt[,title][,default][,xpos][,ypos]
[,helpfile,context])
In this function, only the prompt argument is required with the rest of the 
arguments being optional. The prompt argument specifies the message that 
appears inside the Input dialog box, prompting the user to enter a new value 
(or in this case, a new company name). The prompt argument can be up to 
a maximum of 1,024 characters. If you want the prompt message to appear 
on different lines inside the dialog box, you enter the functions, Chr(13) and 
Chr(10), in the text (to insert a carriage return and a linefeed in the message).
The optional title argument specifies what text to display in the title bar of 
the Input dialog box. If you don’t specify a title argument, Excel displays the 
name of the application on the title bar. The optional default argument speci-
fies the default response that automatically appears in the text box at the 
bottom of the Input dialog box. If you don’t specify a default argument, the 
text box is empty in the Input dialog box.
The xpos and ypos optional arguments specify the horizontal distance from 
the left edge of the screen to the left edge of the dialog box and the vertical 
distance from the top edge of the screen to the top edge of the dialog box. If 
you don’t specify these arguments, Excel centers the input dialog box hori-
zontally and positions it approximately one-third of the way down the screen 
vertically.
The helpfile and context optional arguments specify the name of the custom 
Help file that you make available to the user to explain the workings of the 
Input dialog box as well as the type of data that it accepts. As part of the 
process of creating a custom help file for use in the Excel Help system, 
you assign the topic a context number appropriate to its content, which is 
then specified as the context argument for the InputBox function. When you 
specify a help file and context argument for this function, Excel adds a Help 
button to the custom Input dialog box that users can click to access the 
custom help file in the Help window.
Before you can add the line of code to the macro with the InputBox func-
tion, you need to find the place in the Visual Basic commands where the 
line should go. To enter the Mind Over Media text into the active cell, the 
Company_Name macro uses the following Visual Basic command:
ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = “Mind Over Media”

710
Using the Visual Basic Editor
To add interactivity to the macro, you need to insert the InputBox function 
on a line in the Code window right above this ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 
statement, as follows:
 
1. Position the insertion point in the Code window at the beginning of 
the ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 statement and press Enter to insert a 
new line.
 
 Now that you’ve added a new line, you need to move the insertion point 
up to it.
 
2. Press the ↑ key to position the insertion point at the beginning of the 
new line.
 
 On this line, you want to create a variable that supplies the prompt argu-
ment to the InputBox function. To do this, you state the name of the 
variable (InputMsg in this case) followed by its current entry. Be sure to 
enclose the message text on the right side of the equal sign in a closed 
pair of double quotation marks.
 
3. Type the following code to create the InputMsg variable on line 8 and 
then press the Enter key to start a new line 9:
InputMsg = “Enter the company name or title for this 
worksheet in the text box below and then click OK:”
 
 Next, you create a variable named InputTitle that supplies the optional 
title argument for the InputBox function. This variable makes the text 
“Spreadsheet Title” appear as the title of the Input dialog box. Again, be 
sure to enclose the name for the dialog box title bar in quotation marks.
 
4. Type the following code to create the InputTitle variable on line 9 and 
then press Enter to insert a new line 10:
InputTitle = “Spreadsheet Title”
 
 Next, you create a variable name DefaultText that supplied the optional 
default argument to the InputBox function. This variable makes the text, 
“Mind Over Media,” appear as the default entry on the text box at the 
bottom of the custom Company Name Input dialog box.
 
5. Type the following code to create the DefaultText variable on line 10 
and then press Enter to insert a new line 11:
DefaultText = “Mind Over Media”
 
 Next, you create a final variable named CompanyName that specifies 
the InputBox function as its entry (using the InputMsg, InputTitle, and 
DefaultText variables that you just created) and stores the results of this 
function.
 
6. Type the following code to create the SpreadsheetTitle variable that 
uses the InputBox function on line 11:

Book VIII
Chapter 2
VBA Programming
711
Using the Visual Basic Editor
SpreadsheetTitle = InputBox(InputMsg, InputTitle, 
DefaultText)
 
 Finally, you replace the value, “Mind Over Media,” in the ActiveCell.
FormulaR1C1 property with the SpreadsheetTitle variable (whose value 
is determined by whatever is input into the Spreadsheet Title Input 
dialog box), thus effectively replacing this constant in the macro with 
the means for making this input truly interactive.
 
7. Select “Mind Over Media” on line 12 and replace it with 
SpreadsheetTitle (with no quotation marks).
 
8. Save the edited macro by clicking the Save button on the Visual Basic 
toolbar and then return to the worksheet by the View Microsoft Excel 
button or pressing Alt+F11. Then, click the Hide button in the Window 
group of the View tab.
 
 Now, you’re ready to open a new workbook and run the edited macro by 
pressing Ctrl+N.
Figure 2-4 shows the Code window with the edited Company_Name macro 
after adding the statements that make it interactive. Figure 2-5 shows the 
Spreadsheet Title dialog box in action in the worksheet. This input dialog 
box now automatically appears and prompts you for input whenever you run 
the edited and now fully interactive version of the Company_Name macro.

To go ahead and enter Mind Over Media into the current cell and then 
format it by using the rest of the macro commands, you just click OK in this 
custom dialog box. To enter and format the name of another company, you 
simply type the name of the company (which automatically replaces Mind 
Over Media in the text box) before you click OK.
Writing new macros in the Visual Basic Editor
After you have the skill in the VBA language, you can write new macros from 
scratch in the Visual Basic Editor instead of just editing ones that you’ve 
previously recorded in your spreadsheet by using Excel’s macro recorder. 
When creating a macro from scratch in the Visual Basic Editor, you need to 
follow these general steps:
Why not simply type in the arguments 
of the InputBox function?
The biggest reason for using the variables 
InputMsg, InputTitle, and DefaultText to supply 
the prompt, title, and default arguments of the 
InputBox function — rather than just typing 
them into the function — is their length. If 
you typed in all three pieces of text within the 
parentheses of the InputBox function, you 
would end up with one of the longest (and 
hardest to read) lines of code in history. When 
you use variables to do the job, as in the exam-
ple shown previously, you end up with lines of 
code that fit on one screen, thus making the 
lines of code easier to read and also making 
it possible to print them on a normal piece of 
paper. If you use the variables on other proce-
dures in the macro, declaring them all together 
at the beginning of the code also makes it easy 
to update their values.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
VBA Programming
713
Using the Visual Basic Editor
 
1. Click the name of the VBA project in the Project Explorer window 
where you want to add the new macro.
 
 If you want to write a macro just for the current workbook, click the 
VBAProject function that contains its filename in parentheses, as in 
VBAProject (My Spreadsheet). If you want to write a global macro in the 
Personal Macro Workbook, click VBAProject(PERSONAL.XLSB) in the 
Project Explorer window.
 
2. Choose Insert➪Module on the Visual Basic Editor menu bar.
 
 Excel responds by opening a new, blank Code window in the Visual 
Basic Editor window and by adding another Module icon (named with 
the next available number) in the outline in the Project Explorer window 
under the appropriate VBA Project.
 
 Next, you begin your macro by creating a subroutine (all macros, even 
the ones you record in the spreadsheet, are really Visual Basic subrou-
tines). To do this, you just type sub (for subroutine).
 
3. Type sub and then press the spacebar.
 
 Now, you need to name your new macro, which you do by naming your 
subroutine. Remember that in naming your new macro (or a subrou-
tine), you follow the same rules as when naming a range name (begin 
with a letter and no spaces).
 
4. Type the name of your macro and then press the Enter key.
 
 As soon as you press the Enter key, the Visual Basic Editor inserts a 
closed pair of parentheses after the macro’s name, a blank line, and an 
End Sub statement on its own line below that. It then positions the inser-
tion point at the beginning of the blank line between the lines with the 
Sub and End Sub statements. It’s here that you enter the lines of code 
for the macro that you’re writing.
 
5. Enter the lines of VBA code for the macro in between the Sub and End 
Sub statements.
 
 Before you begin writing the VBA statements that your macro is to 
execute, you should first document the purpose and functioning of this 
macro. To do this, type an apostrophe (‘) at the beginning of each line 
of this text to enter it as a comment (Excel knows not to try to execute 
any line of code that’s prefaced with an apostrophe). When you press 
the Enter key to start a new line that begins with an apostrophe, the line 
of text turns green, indicating that the Visual Basic Editor considers it to 
be a comment that’s not to be executed when the macro runs.
 
 After you document the purpose of the macro with your comments, 
you begin entering the statements that you want the macro to execute 
(which must not be prefaced by apostrophes). To indent lines of code 
to make them easier to read, press Tab. If you need to outdent the 

714
Creating Custom Excel Functions
line, press Shift+Tab. For help on writing VBA code, refer to the VBA 
online help and Steve Cummings’ excellent VBA For Dummies (Wiley 
Publishing). When you finish writing the code for your macro, you need 
to save it before you test it.
 
6. Choose File➪Save on the Visual Basic Editor menu bar or press Ctrl+S.
After you save your new macro, you can click the View Microsoft Excel 
button on the Standard toolbar to return to your worksheet where you can 
try it. To run the new macro that you’ve written, choose Tools➪Macros or 
press Alt+F8 to open the Macro dialog box and then click the name of the 
macro that you just wrote before you click OK.
If Excel encounters an error when running the macro, it returns you to the 
Visual Basic Editor, and an Alert Microsoft Visual Basic dialog box appears 
indicating (in very cryptic form) the nature of the error. Click the Debug 
button in this dialog box to have the Visual Basic Editor highlight the line of 
code that it can’t execute. You can then attempt to find the mistake and edit 
it in the line of code. If you do eliminate the cause of the error, the Visual 
Basic Editor removes the highlighting from that line of code, and you can 
then click the Continue button (which automatically replaces the Run button 
when the Editor goes into debug mode) with the blue triangle pointing to the 
right on the Standard toolbar to continue running the macro.
Creating Custom Excel Functions
One of the best uses of VBA in Excel is to create custom spreadsheet func-
tions also known as user-defined functions (UDFs for short). User-defined 
functions are great because you don’t have to access the Macro dialog box 
to run them. In fact, you enter them into your spreadsheets just like you 
do any of the other built-in spreadsheet functions, either with the Insert 
Function button on the Formula bar or by typing them directly into a cell.
To create a user-defined function, you must do four little things:
 
✦ Create a new module sheet where the custom function is to be defined 
in the Visual Basic Editor by selecting its project in the Project Explorer 
window and then choosing Insert➪Module on the Visual Basic Editor 
menu bar.
 
✦ Enter the name of the custom function and specify the names of the argu-
ments that this function takes on the first line in the Code window — note 
that you can’t duplicate any built-in function names, such as SUM or 
AVERAGE functions, and so on, and you must list argument names in the 
order in which they are processed and enclosed in parentheses.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
VBA Programming
715
Creating Custom Excel Functions
 
✦ Enter the formula, or set of formulas, that tells Excel how to calculate 
the custom function’s result by using the argument names listed in the 
Function command with whatever arithmetic operators or built-in func-
tions are required to get the calculation made on the line or lines below.
 
✦ Indicate that you’ve finished defining the user-defined function by enter-
ing the End Function command on the last line.
To see how this procedure works in action, consider this scenario: Suppose 
that you want to create a custom function that calculates the sales com-
missions for your salespeople based on the number of sales they make in a 
month as well as the total amount of their monthly sales (they sell big-ticket 
items, such as RVs). Your custom Commission function will then have two 
arguments — TotalSales and ItemsSold — so that the first line of code on the 
module sheet in the Code window is
Function Commission(TotalSales,ItemsSold)
In determining how the commissions are actually calculated, suppose that 
you base the commission percentage on the number of sales made during 
the month. For five sales or fewer in a month, you pay a commission rate of 
4.5 percent of the salesperson’s total monthly sales; for sales of six or more, 
you pay a commission rate of 5 percent.
To define the formula section of the Commission custom function, you need 
to set up an IF construction. This IF construction is similar to the IF function 
that you enter into a worksheet cell except that you use different lines in the 
macro code for the construction in the custom function. An ELSE command 
separates the command that is performed if the expression is True from the 
command that is performed if the expression is False. The macro code is 
terminated by an END IF command. To set the custom function so that your 
salespeople get 4.5 percent of total sales for five or fewer items sold and 5 
percent of total sales for more than five items sold, you enter the following 
lines of code underneath the line with the Function command:
If ItemsSold <= 5 Then
Commission = TotalSales * 0.045
Else
Commission = TotalSales * 0.05
End If
Figure 2-6 shows you how the code for this user-defined function appears in 
the Code window for its module sheets. The indents for the IF...END IF 
statements are made with the Tab key and make differentiating the parts 
of the IF construction easy. The first formula, Commission = TotalSales * 
0.045 is used when the IF expression ItemsSold <= 5 is found to be True. 
Otherwise, the second formula underneath the Else command, Commission = 
TotalSales * 0.05 is used.

716
Creating Custom Excel Functions
 
Figure 2-6: 
Entering the

user-
defined 
function in

Macro 
Workbook.
 
After entering the definition for your user-defined function, you are ready 
to save it by choosing File➪Save on the Visual Basic Editor menu bar or by 
pressing Ctrl+S. Then, you can click the View Microsoft Excel button on the 
Standard toolbar to return to the worksheet where you can try out your new 
custom function.
 
If you want to be able to use your user-defined function in any spreadsheet 
you create, be sure that you select VBAProject (personal.xlsb) in the 
Project Explorer window before you open a new module and define the 
custom function there.
Adding a description to a user-defined function
To help your user understand the purpose of your custom functions, you 
can add descriptions that appear in Insert Function and Function Arguments 
dialog boxes that help explain what the function does. To add this kind of 
description to your user-defined function, you use the Object Browser, a 
special window in the Visual Basic Editor that enables you to get information 
about particular objects available to the project that you have open.
To add a description for your user-defined function, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Visual Basic Editor from Excel by clicking the Visual Basic 
button on the Developer tab of the Ribbon or pressing Alt+LV or 
Alt+F11.
 
 Now, you need to open the Object Browser.
 
2. Choose View➪Object Browser from the Visual Basic Editor menu bar 
or press F2.
 
 This action opens the Object Browser window, which obscures the Code

3. Click the drop-down list box that currently contains the value <All 
Libraries> and then click VBAProject on the drop-down list.
 
 When you select VBAProject in this drop-down list, the Object Browser 
then displays your user-defined function as one of the objects in one of 
the Classes in the pane on the left.
 
4. Right-click the name of your user-defined function.
 
 This action selects the function and displays it in the Members pane on 
the right, while at the same time displaying the object’s shortcut menu.
 
5. Click Properties on the shortcut menu.
 
 This action opens the Member Options dialog box for your user-defined 
function, where you can enter your description of this function, as 
shown in Figure 2-7.
 
6. Type the text that you want to appear in the Insert Function and 
Function Arguments dialog box for the user-defined function in the 
Description text box and then click OK.
 
 Now, you can close the Object Browser and save your changes.
 
7. Click the Close Window button to close the Object Browser and then 
choose the File➪Save command.

Using a custom function in your spreadsheet
The great thing about custom functions is that they can be inserted into 
your worksheets with the Insert Function button on the Formula bar. Figures 
2-8 through 2-10 illustrate how easy it is to enter the custom Commission 
function in a worksheet with this button.
Figure 2-8 shows a worksheet that contains a table with the April 2010 
RV sales for three salespeople: Fred, Holly, and Jack. As you can see, the 
Automatic Subtotals feature (covered in Book VI, Chapter 1) has been used to 
compute both the monthly total sales (with the SUM function) and the number 
of sales (with the COUNT function) for each of these three salespeople.

718
Creating Custom Excel Functions
To calculate the April monthly commissions for each salesperson in this 
table, you select the cell where you want the first commission to be cal-
culated (Fred’s commission in cell E5). Click the Insert Function button 
on the Formula bar and then click User Defined at the very bottom of the 
Or Select a Category drop-down list. Doing this displays the PERSONAL.
XLSB!Commission custom function in the Select a Function list box.
When you click OK after selecting the PERSONAL.XLSB!Commission func-
tion in the Insert Function dialog box, the Function Arguments dialog box 
appears, shown in Figure 2-9. Here, you select cell C4 with Fred’s total sales 
amount for April as the TotalSales argument and cell C5 with the number of 
sales made in that month as the ItemsSold argument.
When you click OK in the Function Arguments dialog box, Excel calculates 
Fred’s commission by using the 4.5 percent commission rate because his 
two sales made in April are well below the five sales necessary to bump 
him up to the 5 percent commission rate used by the custom Commission 
function. Figure 2-10 shows the completed April sales table after calculat-
ing the monthly commissions for Fred, Holly, and Jack. In using the custom 
Commission function, both Fred and Holly fall into the 4.5 percent commis-
sion rate. Only Jack, the April RV sales king, gets paid the higher 5 percent 
commission rate for his six sales during this month.

Saving custom functions in add-in files
The only limitation to the user-defined functions that you save as part of 
a regular workbook file or the Personal Macro Workbook file is that when 
you enter them directly into a cell (without the use of the Insert Function 
dialog box), you must preface their function names with their filenames. For 

720
Creating Custom Excel Functions
example, if you want to type in the custom Commission function that’s saved 
in the Personal Macro Workbook, you enter the following formula:
=Commission(C9,C10)
Assuming that cell C9 contains the total sales and cell C10 contains the 
number of items sold, Excel returns the #NAME? error value to the cell. If 
you then edit the function to include the Personal Macro Workbook’s file-
name as follows:
=PERSONAL.XLSB!Commission(C9,C10)
Excel calculates the sales commission based on the TotalSales in C9 and the 
ItemsSold in C10, returning this calculated value to the cell containing this 
user-defined function.
To be able to omit the filename from the custom functions that you create 
when you enter them directly into a cell, you need to save the workbook 
file that contains them as a special add-in file (for details on using add-ins in 
Excel, see Book I, Chapter 3). Then, after you’ve saved the workbook with 
your user-defined functions as an add-in file, you can start entering them 
into any worksheet sans their filename qualifier by activating the add-in in 
the Add-Ins dialog box (Alt+FIAA and then click the Go command button 
when Excel Add-Ins is displayed on the Manage drop-down list button).
To convert a workbook containing the user-defined functions that you want 
to be able to enter into worksheets without their filenames, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open the workbook in which you’ve saved your user-defined func-
tions in Excel.
 
 Make sure that each of the custom functions works properly.
 
2. Press Alt+F11 or click the Visual Basic command button on the 
Developer tab or press Alt+LV if the Developer tab is displayed on the 
Ribbon.
 
 This action opens the Visual Basic Editor window with the workbook file 
containing the user-defined functions selected in the Project Explorer 
window. Now you want to set up protection for this workbook so that no 
one but you can modify its contents.
 
3. Choose Tools➪VBAProject Properties from the Visual Basic Editor’s 
menu bar.
 
 This action opens the VBAProject — Project Properties dialog box with 
a General and a Protection tab, shown in Figure 2-11.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
VBA Programming
721
Creating Custom Excel Functions
 
4. Click the Protection tab and then click the Lock Project for Viewing 
check box.
 
 Putting a check mark in this check box prevents other users from view-
ing the custom functions so that they can’t make any changes to them. 
Next, you add a password that prevents them from removing the view 
protection status.
 
5. Click the Password text box, enter the password there, and then click 
the Confirm Password text box and re-enter the password exactly as 
you entered it in the text box above before you click OK.
 
 Now you’re ready to return to the worksheet where you need to add a 
title and description for the new add-in file.
 
6. Click the View Microsoft Excel button at the beginning of the Standard 
toolbar.
 
 This action returns you to the worksheet in Excel. Before saving the 
workbook as an add-in, you should add a title for the user-defined func-
tions that it contains (this information then appears in the Add-Ins 
dialog box whenever you select the add-in file).
 
7. Click File➪Info.
 
 Excel 2010 displays the Information panel about the workbook in the 
Backstage view. Here you enter a brief name for the add-in in the Title 
field and a longer description of its custom functions.
 
8. Click the Title text box and enter a descriptive title for the add-in, and 
then click the Save As option on the menu in the Backstage view.
 
 This action opens the Save As dialog box, where you need to change 
the file type from Microsoft Excel Workbook (*.xlsx) to Microsoft Excel 
Add-In (*.xlam) and then specify the filename (to which Excel automati-
cally appends the .xlam filename extension) under which to save it.
 
9. Click the Save as Type pop-up button and then scroll all the way down 
to the bottom of the list and click Microsoft Excel Add-In (*.xlam).
 
 This action selects the Add-Ins folder in the Save In drop-down list box 
showing the names of any add-in files that you’ve saved there.
 
10. Click the File Name combo box and make any necessary changes to 
the filename (without changing the .xlam filename extension) before 
you click the Save button.
 
 After saving your workbook as an add-in file, you’re ready to activate the 
add-in so that you can enter its user-defined functions in any worksheet.
 
11. Click File➪Options or press Alt+FI and then click Add-Ins in the 
Navigation pane on the left.

722
Creating Custom Excel Functions
 
12. Click the Go button near the bottom of the Add-Ins tab after checking 
to make sure that Excel Add-Ins is displayed on the Manage drop-
down list button.
 
 This action opens the Add-Ins dialog box showing the names of all the 
available add-ins. You must now add the name of your new add-in to this 
list.
 
13. Click the Browse button in the Add-Ins dialog box.
 
 This action opens the Browse dialog box that shows the contents of 
your Add-Ins folder.
 
14. Click the name of your new add-in file in the Browse list box and then 
click OK.
 
 This action closes the Browse dialog box and returns you to the Add-Ins 
dialog box that now lists your new add-in file. Now all you have to do 
is make sure that the check box in front of the name of the new add-in 
(which displays the title and description you gave the add-in at the 
bottom of the Add-Ins dialog box) is selected before you click OK (see 
Figure 2-12).
 
15. Click the check box in front of the name of the new add-in and then 
click OK.
 
As soon as you click OK, Excel closes the Add-Ins dialog box and you can 
then start entering the custom functions that this add-in file contains 
directly into the cells of any spreadsheet without having to open the Insert 
Function dialog box.

Appendix: Using XML File Formats
E
xcel 2010 supports an XML-based file format (which Microsoft officially 
calls the Microsoft Office Open XML format). The XML format is touted 
as being much more efficient at saving data, which results in smaller file 
sizes and offers superior integration with external data sources (especially 
when these resources are Web-based ones supporting XML files). The basic 
XML-based file format carries the filename extension .xlsx and is the file 
format in which Excel automatically saves any new workbook you create. In 
addition, Excel supports the following file format extensions:
 
✦ .xlsm for macro-enabled XML workbook files
 
✦ .xltx for XML template files
 
✦ .xltm for macro-enabled XML template files
 
✦ .xlsb for non-XML binary workbook files
 
✦ .xlam for macro-enabled add-in files
 
The only problem with that this new-fangled XML-based file format is that 
it’s not one that earlier versions of Excel can open. This means that if every-
body who needs to work with the workbook you’ve just created hasn’t yet 
upgraded to Excel 2007 or 2010, you need to save the new workbook in the 
earlier file format used in versions 97 through 2003 with the old .xls filename 
extension. To do this, click the File menu, and then highlight Save As and 
click the Excel 97-2003 Workbook option on the Save As submenu as the file 
type. You can also select the Excel 97-2003 Workbook (*.xls) file type in the 
Save As Type drop-down list box if you open the Save As dialog box by click-
ing File➪Save As or pressing Alt+FA.
Keep in mind that filename extensions such as .xlsx and .xls do not appear 
as part of the filename in the File Name text box in the Save As dialog box 
unless you’ve removed the check mark from the Hide Extensions for Known 
File Types check box. (This check box is found on the View tab of the Folder 
Options dialog box in any Windows Explorer window such as Documents in 
Windows 7 or Vista and My Documents in Windows XP.) To open the Folder 
Options dialog box from a Windows 7 or Windows Vista Explorer window, 
you click the Folder and Search option on the Organize button’s drop-down 
menu. To open this dialog box from a Windows XP Explorer window, you 
click Folders Options on the Tool’s pull-down menu.
 
The binary file format called Office Excel Binary, or BIFF12 for short, that 
carries the .xlsb filename extension is designed for really huge spreadsheets 
that you create that have to be backwardly compatible with earlier versions 
of Excel.
