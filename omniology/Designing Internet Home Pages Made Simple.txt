Pref ace 
Almost all information on the Internet is held on Web pages, written in 
HyperText Markup Language -
HTML. This book aims to show you how, 
using a few simple HTML commands, you can create good looking Internet 
pages that include both text and graphics. Now you can leave something 
behind on the Internet to tell other 'surfers' about yourself. 
This book has been written to appeal to anyone who is new to the subject 
of HTML. Each technique such as writing text, including a picture or 
drawing a line is discussed individually, thereby allowing the reader to 
learn one skill before progressing onto another or only learn those 
techniques that are of value to them. 
Alternatively, this book will serve as a handy reference to anyone who 
knows HTML but needs an easy-to-read reminder on the instructions 
required to implement a certain feature. It covers versions up to the current 
latest, HTML 4.0. 
The first chapter introduces you to the Internet pages and the factors to 
consider when building your Web page. You will also be introduced to some 
of the tools that are available. 
Over the next six chapters you will learn how to include text, graphics, 
sound and introduce some advanced techniques like jumping to other 
pages and building forms so people can send you messages. There will also 
be a short introduction on how to include Java applets on your Web page 
or interact with your visitors using Javascript. 
The final chapter explains how to install your Web page on the Internet and 
register it with Internet search engines.

The Web 
2 
The World Wide Web, commonly known as the Web, is one of the 
fastest growing areas on the Internet. It grew from a project in 1989 
at CERN in Switzerland. The goal was to devise a way to share 
information over the Internet and look at what it has evolved into! 
The Web is growing from a place where you could find information 
to a major place for commerce. In a few years, the Web has evolved 
from static, simple pages to highly sophisticated sites where you 
can buy goods and services safely. New companies have emerged 
which only do business over the Web, like the bookseller 
www.amazon.com. 
Constructing a Web page is straightforward and once it is installed, 
it's there for the millions of Internet users to see. For a company, it 
is a tremendous marketing and new business opportunity, and for 
the home user -
welcome to your biggest audience ever. 
Information on the World Wide Web is held on Web pages. The first 
page is usually referred to as the home page and it is from here, 
that all pages are referenced. A personal Web page can contain 
absolutely anything that you like, but most service providers insist 
on no commercial advertising. 
Just as a house has an address, so does every page on the Internet. 
This address is called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and using 
Take note

Personal users wanting to connect to the Internet will need a 
modem, the faster the better, a browser to displavthe Web pages 
and a service provider who provides the connection. (Read The 
Internet MadeSimplefor more about connecting to the Internet.) 
Designing and writing Web pages, can be done off-line-without 
connecting to the Internet-thus saving vou heftvtelephone bills. 

it, anyone can access your Web page. The precise naming scheme 
for your Web page can be advised by your Web administrator or 
service provider. Typically, they take the form of organization 
address and then an identifier. For example, the author's home 
page with service provider Claranet can be found at http:// 
home.clara.net/ lmhobbs where home.clara.net defines the Claranet 
site and lmhobbs is the page on that site. 
The final component worthy of mention is the Web browser which 
is required to view Web pages. Although a number are available, the 
two in most common use are Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
internet Explorer. Which browser you use is a matter of personal 
preference and the level of HTML it supports (see next page). 
Below is shown an example of a Web site displayed using Netscape.

What is HTML? 
4 
Web pages are written using a system called HfML (HyperText 
Markup Language), which is continually evolving to meet the grow-
ing demands of the Internet. This book concentrates on how to 
create Web pages using HTML. Java and JavaScript are also becoming 
very popular and in a subsequent chapter we will see how to include 
Java applets and JavaScript code in our HTML documents. 
Although HTML is used to create the page we see in the browser, it 
doesn't have to be hand-crafted as shown in this book. There are a 
number of editors available, such as Microsoft Front Page or Net-
scape Composer which create HTML documents. Using this approach 
should not be considered as cheating, rather a cost-effective use of 
your valuable time. 
When surfing the Web, you may come across pages which say that 
this page is best viewed with a specific version of Netscape or 
Internet Explorer. If you do ever include any special HTML com-
mands which only work on a certain browser, it is courteous to 
include this message. Several of these HTML statements will be 
illustrated in later chapters. 
Another point worth remembering is that Web browsers often 
display information slightly differently, so don't be surprised if your 
page looks different on someone else's system. 
So what is HTML? It's a mark-up system that comprises of tags, 
where a tag is an instruction contained within angle brackets, e.g. 
Tip 
If you want for ideas for using HTML, take a look atsomebody else's Web page to 
see how they did it. Web browsers permit you to see the HTML used to create the 
Web page. In Netscape, use the command View - Page Source; in Internet 
Explorer4.0, the command is View-Source. 

<HTML> is a tag that defines the start of a HTML document. The 
vast majority of tags also have a closing tag, e.g. </HTML> defines 
the end of the document. HTML is constantly evolving, with new 
tags and extra facilities being added regularly. The current version 
-
and the one which is the focus of this book -
is 4.0. 
Below is a sample of some of the HTML used to construct the 
author's Web page. Don't be put off by all these tags. When you have 
finished reading this book, it will all make sense! An important point 
to remember is that it is the tags which control the final appearance 
-
not how you type the text in, so you can use indents and line 
breaks wherever you need to, to make the code easier to read.

Web page elements 
You probably have some idea of what you would like to include on 
your Web site, but if you are new to the Web, explore a little and see 
what is possible to achieve. There are examples throughout this 
book, but here are a few sites worth visiting. 
• 
http://www.oracle.com - shows layout and frame usage; 
• 
http://www.bbc.co.uk- demonstrates use of multiple pages; 
• 
http://www.novaspace.com - excellent graphics; 
• 
http://www.royal-and-sunalliance.com - user interaction. 
If you are only creating personal pages, remember, that provided 
you have the space, you too can construct Web pages like these! 
So what can you put on a Web page? A very simple page need only 
include text and this is a good place to start to familiarise yourself 
with HTML before moving onto more complex options.

Graphics and Image Maps 
A Web page of just text is not very exciting, so it's far more likely that 
you will want to include pictures. These pictures could be there just 
for information, like the ones at NASA showing pictures taken from 
the latest space mission or a personal site could contain family, 
holiday or wedding shots. 
A common use for a graphic, is as a jump point to another Web page. 
The picture is used instead of words to describe where to go, or in 
conjunction with words. If the pointer changes to a hand when it is 
over a picture, it means that clicking on it will take you to that Web 
page or a different location within the current document. Pictures 
are fun to use but it is always good practice to include some text so 
that people can be sure what clicking on the picture will give them. 
Also, bear in mind that not everyone waits for the picture to display, 
and some people turn off image-loading altogether.

forms 
Whether you are a business or an individual, once your page is on 
the Web, it's nice to know who has read it or to get some feedback 
from visitors. This can be done through a form where they can 
respond to questions. You often meet forms at a commercial sites, 
such as the one shown below for a car insurance quote. But forms 
are for everyone, not just companies trying to sell you something -
you will be surprised at who you will meet. The author has made 
contact with people from around the world, thanks to a form.

Frames are now being used on many Web sites. They have become 
so popular because they enable you to split your page into several 
areas, displaying different information in each area on the page. 
Take the following example from the Performance Bicycle site. This 

makes use of frames within the catalogue section to display a list of 
the components on the left-hand side, whilst saving the main area 
for textual and graphical information. By clicking on say Helmets, 
the left frame box will change to display all the helmets they sell. 
You can then click on a specific helmet to obtain more detailed 
information in the main window, while still maintaining a list of the 
all the helmets sold in the left frame box.

Planning your Web page 
10 
Now is the big moment, what do you want to include on your Web 
page? Why have you decided to announce yourself to the world? Is 
there something you want to tell everyone? How do you want to 
present your organisation to the world. It's entirely up to you what 
to include, but to give you some ideas: 
• 
Tell us about your organization; 
• 
Pictures, which could be of yourself or your products; 
• 
Video of your product, a promotional trailer; 
• 
A form where people can reply to questions you ask; 
• 
Multiple pages to split the information into specific areas; 
• 
Java applets to display promotional advertisements; 
• 
Split the page into multiple framed areas; 
• 
Use Javascript to perform more complex tasks; 
• 
On a personal page tell us about your work or the hobbies 
you participate in. This is a good place to include links to 
other sites related to your hobby. 
The first step is to decide what you want to include on the Web 
pages. This should involve drafting out on paper how each page will 
look, rather like the example on the facing page. 
It is not uncommon for a commercial organisation to employ a 
graphic artist to design the look of the Web site because the task 
ahead is not that different to producing a leaflet or poster for a 
marketing campaign. 
Tip 
Continuallv evolve vour Web page bv presenting different 
information and bvtaking advantage of new HTML options.

Structure of an HTML document 
<HTML> 
<HEAD> 
12 
HTML is a simple language to learn and use. It is written using tags, 
where a tag is an instruction enclosed within < > (angle brackets). 
For example, the instruction to start a document is <HTML>. Tagged 
text is normally terminated with the same tag, but with a forward-
slash. Therefore, the closing tag in this example is </HTML>. 
The HTML document can be constructed using any editor such as 
Notepad or Wordpad. When the document is saved, it should have 
a file extension of .htm or .html. 
HTML tags can be nested, therefore you could begin by using the 
tag to define a table and then within the table tags include HTML to 
format text or create a bulleted list. Another feature of the HTML 
language is that many tags have extra qualifiers, defined within the 
tags to describe the information they should display. 
There are three tags which define the structure of the HTML 
document. The <HTML> tag is mandatory and defines the start and 
end of the document. The <HEAD> and <BODY> tags are optional, 
but should be used as they help to define the structure. 
This tag defines the start of the HTML document and is always on 
the first line. The end of the document is defined by the </HTML> 
tag. 
The <HEAD> tag is used to define the header portion of the HTML 
document. Items such as the document title and the style of the 
document may be specified here. Keywords for search engines (see 
page 1 70) are also written here. Apart from the title, nothing written 
in the HEAD section is visible on the Web page. The section is 
located at the beginning of the document and must be terminated 
with a </HEAD> tag. 

<BODY> 
The <BODY> and </BODY> tags enclose the code which produces 
the visible Web page. Options within the <BODY> tag can be used to 
describe the characteristics of the Web page, such as background 
colour or the colour of text. A background image can also be 
defined within this tag. 
Shown below is the typical framework for an HTML document 
comprising of the <HEAD> and <BODY> sections with some sample 
tags

A simple first Web page 
<Hl> 
14 
Let's begin by creating a very simple first Web page which will 
contain simply your name in large bold letters. All the examples 
shown here, will be created using nothing more than the Windows 
Notepad, however, you can use any text editor to create them. This 
is not a very exciting first page, because its purpose is to introduce 
you to using the tags in the HTML language. The two used here are: 
e <HTML> 
e <Hl> 
Before starting to create your Web site it is a good idea to create a 
new folder or a directory to store all the components of your home 
page. It is also worth considering creating sub-folders for the other 
components such as pictures, Java applets and retired HTML 
documents that you may decide to archive. 
Now select your favourite text editor such as the Windows Notepad 
which can be found in the Accessories group. 
This tag define the top heading which is why it is called Hl. H for 
heading and 1 for the top level. Everything that you type after <HI> 
will be displayed as a heading. Therefore it is very important to 
specify the </Hl> tag when you have finished writing the heading 
and this rule applies to every tag that has a closing tag. 
Follow the numbered steps opposite to build your first Internet 
home page and see how it will look.

You have just written your first Web page, now it is time to see how 
it looks. Viewing is a simple process and the good news is, you don't 
have to be connected to the Internet. This not only can save you 
money, but also means that you can see how the page looks before 
it is installed onto the Web. After all, make a mistake and everyone 
on the Web can see it! 
Viewing the Web page is achieved by using your Web browser. 
Every browser is different, but they all provide an option to open an 
HTML file, in Netscape it is on the File menu. 
Take a look at your Web page, is it what you expected? The first time 
it probably isn't quite want you wanted. This is not a problem! No 
one ever gets it right first time, in fact most people have to make 
several changes. Typically a heading or graphic may be in the wrong 
place or you don't like the look and feel of the page. Making it look 
right takes a little time and is half the fun of creating Web pages. 
As we progress through this book some of the tasks may seem rather 
complex. In this situation, you may prefer to use one of the many 
tools that are available to construct the page, instead of creating it 
manually. 
Another important point to remember is that once an HTML docu-
ment is on the Internet, it should be kept up to date. It is very easy 
to forget it, so make sure that Web page maintenance is included as 
part of your routine system administration.

Your Web browser may be set up to connect to an Internet site when it first 
starts. Therefore when you start the browser off line, itmayappearto hang trying 
to make the connection. If this happens, just press the Stop icon. Now you can 
specify the file to display.

Viewing source files 
18 
While surfing you will probably come across pages and will say to 
yourself, 'how did they do that?' Well the good news is they can't 
keep it a secret, because you can view the source HTML from your 
Web browser and even save it for future reference. 
One point to bear in mind is that this HTML may be specific to the 
original author's browser. Therefore, there is no guarantee it will 
work on your system. 
The technique described here applies to any Web page browser. All 
that may differ is the terminology used to open and view the HTML. 
Another important point to consider is that if the Web page is using 
frames (see Chapter 6), then you will only be able to see all the 
HTML source code if your browser provides the capability to 
display frame sources as well as the HTML source. 
Select Page Source in Netscape 
or Source in Internet Explorer

HTML editors 
20 
There is an alternative to writing the HTML yourself and that is to 
use a software product to create your Web page. Although HTML is 
fairly easy to write, if you don't feel up to the task ahead, especially 
if you are trying to create something that uses a number of HTML 
tags, then an editor will do the job quickly and easily. There are a 
number available on the Internet, if the one you select isn't freeware, 
please ensure the continued development of the product, by paying 
the appropriate fee. The products used in this book are Front Page 
Express, supplied with Internet Explorer 4.0, and Composer, which 
is part of the Netscape Gold packages and the Communicator suite. 
Using editors to create Web pages, should not be seen as 'cheating'! 
They provide a useful helping hand, especially when you are first 
getting started. Once the software has created the initial document, 
you can then edit it by hand and add extra features that may not be 
available in the software. 
Editors are also useful when you have something complex to create. 
For example, creating a table is tricky due to the number of tags 
required to define each cell in the table. So in this instance, why not 
use the software and open your existing HTML document. Edit it to 
add the table and then save it again. You could then continue to 
maintain this document manually in the future. 
There are many editors available, some are self-contained and 
others integrate with word processing software like Microsoft Word, 
Ami Pro and Wordperfect. When they integrate directly with a 
product, you have the added advantage of not needing to learn a 
new tool, only a few new commands to use the options. 
Of course, if you are in the business of professional Web publishing 
then you can use software like Microsoft Front Page, the full-
featured version of Front Page Express. 
Here we can see the same Web page being created using Netscape 
Composer and Front Page Express. A document created by one 
editor, will not always display correctly in another, although the 
HTML generated will result in the browser output being the same. 

Tip 
Some editors are 
available as evalua-
tion copies for vou to 
trv before vou buv.

Summary 
22 
At the end of this chapter, although you may not have learnt many 
of the HTML tags, you should now have an understanding of what 
is involved in creating a Web page and the basic skills that are 
required before you start writing HTML. 
Some useful tasks to complete include: 
D 
Collect all the information that is to be presented on your 
Web page,this includes the text to be displayed, photo-
graphs, images and video. 
D 
Start to draft out how this information is to be presented. 
D 
Decide which text editor will be used and create a Web page 
comprising of the basic structure. 
D 
Familiarise yourself with the procedure for displaying the 
Web page in your browser.

Title 
24 
After the <HTML> and <HEAD> tags, the next item that needs to be 
included on a Web page is a title which requires the tag <TITLE>. 
Include this tag on every document because: 
• 
it appears as the title in the window; 
• 
when someone saves your Web page, the title will appear in 
their bookmark list if they are using Netscape -
Internet 
Explorer users will be asked if they want to use the title; 
• 
anyone using a Web search engine will see this name as the 
title of your Web page. 
The title can be anything. For a personal page, your name or nickname 
is the obvious choice. If the page is being designed for commercial 
use, set a new title for every page, as visitors may bookmark several 
pages and it is annoying to find that every page has the same title. 
The definition of the title is completed by using the tag </TITLE>. 
The title on the Paramount Web site 
is 'Welcome to Paramount Pictures'

Plain text 
Although most Web pages make extensive use of graphics, they still 
have to include considerable amounts of text. Including text in an 
HTML document is easy, and needs no formatting, because the 
browser is responsible for that task. When plain text is being included, 
it is the only time that a tag is not required. 
It can be very tempting when building a Web site to include many 
graphics and only have a small percentage of text. However, one very 
important point to remember is that the Web can be slow returning 
information, even if you have a very fast connection to the Internet. 
If the site takes too long to display, the visitor may decide to abandon 
your site and move onto another. Graphics are slower to download 
than text - a page of text may be less than a kilobyte, but a single 
graphic may require 30 kilobytes or more.

The library, containing over 4000 books and numerous periodicals, is 
maintained at Burlington House, Piccadilly. It is open to members on 
Wednesdays from 13:00 to 17:00 hours. Books and slides may be 
borrowed in person or by post at the member's expense. 
Transparencies and other materials are available for loan, and 
catalogues may be obtained for a small charge. It is regretted that 
library books, slides and instruments are not normally sent overseas.

End of document 
document 
Referring to this example from the British Astronomical Association 
Web site, the text is written in the HTML document as per normal text 
writing. When the page is displayed, the browser automatically formats 
the text and generates new lines when required. Whenever the browser 
window is changed in size, the text is automatically adjusted to fit in 
the available window. Note how the browser displays a ragged edge. 
Shortly we will see how we can align the text and create our own line 
breaks. 
27 

Headings and text 
28 
One of the first steps we completed when designing our Web page was 
to group the subject matter together and put it under different 
headings. 
Headings are defined by level, where level 1 is the highest and uses the 
largest font, 2 the next and so forth. Referring to our example from the 
British Astronomical Association, the main heading at the top of the 
page, British Astronomical Association is level 1. Each of the topics 
would then be level 2 such as Contents. A description for each section 
is then placed under a level 3 heading. HTML permits a maximum of 
6 levels, but you will probably not use more than 3 or 4.All of these tags 
have a corresponding closing tag such as </Hl> and </H2> depending on 
the heading being used. The six heading tags are: 
• <HI> </Hl> 
• <H2> </H2> 
• <H3> </H3> 
• <H4> </H4> 
• <H5> </HS> 
• <H6> </H6> 
To specify the heading text, simply write the text after the heading tag 
and then finish it with the terminating tag. 
Headings are extremely useful and a useful technique which we will 
see later is how to jump to a specific heading in a document. 
If the default font and size is unsuitable then it can be changed using 
a style sheet (see page 73), provided that your browser supports this 
feature. 
Take note 
f~\J 
~ 
You must include the closing tag, otherwise all 
text is displaved using the larger heading font.

Paragraphs 
30 
One of the problems with the browser automatically reformatting the 
text, is that the resulting output may not be what you require. There 
are two important tags to include when writing text. 
• 
<P> 
Paragraph; 
• 
<BR> New line. 
This is the tag that is used to define the start of a paragraph. It is 
placed at the beginning of each paragraph and causes a blank line to 
be inserted before the text written after the <P> tag. This is one of the 
few tags that has the option of using the closing </P> tag and most 
HTML authors do not use the </P> tag. 
HTML document as 
displayed by browser 

<BR> 
Sometimes you may want to start a new line without creating a blank 
line above it. This is achieved using the <BR> tag which starts text on 
the next line. 
When these tags are used, it is not uncommon to include them at the 
start or end of the text. This can result in difficulty in identifying 
where a new paragraph or line may start when you are editing your 
HTML code. It is suggested that the <BR> and <P> tags reside on their 
own line. This will also help the author appreciate how the Web page 
might look in the browser.

Highlighting text 
Sometimes, certain words or phrases in text need to be brought to the 
readers' attention. HTML provides the ability to: 
• 
embolden a word 
• 
display in italics 
• 
underline words 
• 
cause words to blink 
Text is highlighted by inserting the appropriate tag before the word 
or phrase to be highlighted, with the equivalent 'off' tag at the end of 
the text, to close it. It is very important to remember to use the closing 
tag. Without it, text will remain highlighted! 
Since these tags are embedded within the text, reading the HTML 
document is not always easy. Placing spaces around the tags to 
improve legibility. This will not affect the final appearance as all extra 
spaces are ignored by the browser. 
Bold <B> or <STRONG> 
One of the best methods to make text stand out from normal text is to 
embolden it. This can be achieved using one of two tags, <B> or 
<STRONG>. They both work in much the same way - <B> is always 
bold, but in theory users can define how <STRONG> is represented in 
their browsers - and must be closed using the </B> or </STRONG> 
tags respectively. 
Italic <I> or <EM> 
Text can appear in italics which helps to make it stand out from the 
other text, although it may not stand out quite as well. Once again 
there is a choice of two tags, <I> or <EM> (emphasis, user-definable) 
and they must be closed using the </I> and </EM> tags respectively. 
Underline <U> 
Text can be underlined using the <U> tag and closed with the </U> tag. 
32 

Highlight 
<HTML> 
My job keep 
e <B>very busy </B> but I try to keep fit riding my 
<STRONG>mountain bike. </STRONG> 
<P> 
Underline text 
Of course, I always wear a <U>cycle helmet </U>. 
<P> 
Why? because if you have 
<!>fallen ff </I> in the <EM> wo ds</EM> as many times as I have, 
keeping you head 
</HTML> 
Underlined text 
33 

Blinking <BLINI(> (Netscape Only) 
The selected text will blink. However, be advised that not all browsers 
support this tag. Don't forgot to terminate the blinking text using the 
closing tag </BLINK>. 
Quotation <Q> and <CITE> 
If text is a quotation which needs to stand out from the rest of the text. 
This can be achieved using the <Q> and <CITE> tags and is closed 
using the </Q> and </CITE> tags respectively. 
Sample <SAMP> 
The sample output tag can prove to be very useful. It allows you to 
include any text, such as the output from a program. To format the 
text inside the tag, tags such as <BR> must be included to generate a 
new line. 
Subscript <SUB> 
Sometimes you may want to include scientific notification on your 
Web page, which can be achieved using the <SUB> tag. For example, 
to display the chemical symbol for water, H20 . DOn't forget to close 
with the </SUB> tag. 
Superscript <SUP> 
34 
The <SUP> tag is the opposite of the <SUB> tag because it raises the 
text, rather than lower it. Therefore this is the tag to use for displaying 
scientific notification, as in the example opposite, or for names, such 
as Scottish ones like MCKenzie. Close with the </SUP> tag.

Address 
<ADDRESS> 
36 
Many Web pages, usually at the bottom of the page, contains some 
reference information. For consistency, this information can be styled 
with the <ADDRESS> tag, which sets text in italic in a slightly smaller 
font size than normal text. 
Some of the things you can include in an address section are: 
• 
Date the page was last updated. This enables the reader to 
determine how accurate the information on the page is. 
• 
Your name with a contact email address. We will see later 
how someone can click on text and this will bring up a 
window so that they can send you email. 
• 
Your location or department. 
• 
Other contributors to the Web site 
• 
Commercial sites should consider which of the following are 
appropriate; copyright notice, registered trademarks, legal 
disclaimer, privacy policy 
• 
How to contact the Webmaster or organisation who is 
responsible for managing the site. 
• 
Number of visitors to the site 
The address starts with<ADDRESS> and is closed with the</ADDRESS> 
tag. If several lines are needed, you must insert the <BR> tag to move 
to a new line and use the <P> tag to leave a blank line. 
All the formatting tags such as <B> and <U> can be used inside the 
address tag along with the tags to include graphics or links to other 
Web sites. See how in the example, the clause ALIGN= is used to place 
the text in the centre of the page and the <P> tag was used to create 
a new text block. 
The suggested contents for the page footer don't have to be included 
within the <ADDRESS> tag. Many sites, display this information using 
ordinary tags and there is nothing wrong with this approach.

Alignment 
.· 
"' 
38 
Some tags have options which are defined inside the tag. For example, 
the clause ALIGN= can be placed inside a tag to control how the text 
is to be positioned, as illustrated below. 
<Tag ALIGN= keyword> 
where the keywords are: 
e 
LEFT 
e 
RIGHT 
Positions the paragraph on the left side. 
Aligns the paragraph at the right end. 
• 
CENTER Centres the paragraph. Note American spelling. 
• 
JUSTIFY Attempts to adjust the paragraph so that every line 
ends on the same right-hand column. Don't be surprised if it 
doesn't look completely justified, because the browser only 
makes a best attempt. 
Throughout this book the ALIGN= clause will be seen in numerous 
examples. It can be used within many tags to format paragraphs, 
headings and graphics.

Preforrnatted text 
There are times when it is desirable to display the text exactly as it is 
written. Since the browser will automatically format your text, you 
can override the default behaviour by use of the <PRE> or 
<BLOCKQUOTE> tags. 
<PRE> 
pre 
40 
This tag takes the text and displays it, exactly as it is written in the 
HTML document. This tag is useful when specific formatting is required, 
which is difficult to achieve with HTML tags and clauses, such as 
ALIGN= and <BR>. This tag must be closed with the </PRE> tag 
otherwise no subsequent formatting of any text will occur. 
<HTML> 
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>The Monitor</H2> 
Here is a Quote 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
Gail Russell Chaddock is a Staff Writer for the Cliristian Science Monitor 
Newspaper which is published weekly in Europe and daily in the US. 
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<PRE> 
One of my personal favourites 
Text as written 
is on the museums

</PRE> 
</HTML> 
At the moment Gail is 
writing many articles on 
American education. 
I also 1ked the one about 
the memorial to the woman of 
American who served during 
the war 
read them in the archives at 
http://www.csmonitor.com. 

lt is however suggested that the <PRE> tag is only used when absolutely 
necessary. If text is formatted automatically, the reader sees the 
entire width of the page. But with pre-formatted text, it is displayed 
exactly as it was entered in the HTML file, which means some informa-
tion could be lost off the side of the display. 
<BLOCl<QUOH> 
.· 
The <BLOCKQUOTE> tag will automatically format the text, however, 
it is different because the text is automatically indented. Therefore 
this tag is extremely useful for making text stand out on the Web page. 
In the example below, you can see how the font is changed from the 
standard font in order to emphasize the text.

Comments 
It is extremely good practice to include comments in your Web 
documents, just as you would if you were writing a computer program. 
Unless the Web page is very simple, it will help you or anyone else in 
the future, understand what was written. 
Useful comments to include are the author's name, and either the date 
the document was last changed or a revision history list. Normally 
authors only include the date the document was last changed, but 
HTML documents are becoming more complex, especially if, for 
example, Javascript or other advanced features are being used. The 
HTML document should then be considered a piece of programming 
code where comments are essential. Although it may seem obvious to 
you now what this document is doing, in a few months' time it might 
not make sense at all. 
The<!--> tag is used to start the comment and <-->to close it. You can 
write as many comments as you like because they are invisible on the 
finished page. A comment can be placed anywhere on a line because 
the only time it can be viewed, is when the source for the page is 
requested.

Netscape Composer 
Netscape Composer is an editor that comes with Netscape 
Communicator or Netscape Gold. It can be started directly from the 
Netscape browser or launched on its own. If you have ever used word 
processing software like Microsoft Word for Windows then you will 
feel quite at home. The editor uses the WYSIWYG (what you see is 
what you get) approach, which means that you create the Web 
document, complete with lines, tables and images just as you expect 
to see it, but behind the screen, the editor is producing normal HTML 
code. Therefore you never need to see the HTML that creates the 
document. 
Getting started 
Tool bar 
44 
When Netscape Composer first launches, take some time to explore 
and understand the options available from the icons at the top of the 
screen, because this is what you will need to create your document. 
If you look at the screenshot below, you can see all the different 
options available. For example, clicking on the H.Line icon will draw 
a horizontal line. To select the type of text such as heading, text or list, 
select it from the drop-down list on the left. 
Include a picture 
Save it 
~ El 
~ 
h~ I~ Hl..-.eo 1~ 'i~ 
~ IF. 
from this list 

Once you are familiar with the options, it's time to create your first 
document. By default you are presented with a blank screen. Type 
your text and format it, either by selecting a style from the drop down 
list, such as a heading or text, or by choosing the font size, font and 
whether the text is to be bolded and how it is to be aligned. Although 
this may sound a lot to do, if you are use to using a word processor, 
it will be familiar. Repeat this process for all the text that you want on 
the page. In the example below we can see text using the Heading I and 
normal format. 
When you are entering text, it is very easy to make a typing mistake. 
No one wants to publish a Web page with spelling mistakes, but it is 
very easy to do unless you run the source file through a spelling 
checker. Netscape Composer provides no excuses because you can 
click on the spelling icon at anytime to check for mistakes. Do 
remember, however, that it won't pick up words which are wrong 
rather than misspelt, e.g. 'you' instead of 'your'.

f rontPage Express 
Microsoft have a very good application for designing Web pages, 
called FrontPage, but for the average home user, its cost is probably 
too high. However, do not despair, when you install Microsoft Inter-
net Explorer 4, one of the options you can select is a cut-down version 
called FrontPage Express. It is easy to use and will enable you to 
generate very nice Web pages. 
Getting started 
When you launch the editor, it looks, at first glance, very similar to 
Netscape Composer. Using the icons shown here you can select a 
heading, a font, specify the font size or include a graphic or table.

When you select a new page, the first prompt you 
see is which wizard you would like. If you select 
Normal Page, which is highlighted in the example 
then a blank page appears. But if you are not sure 
of what you want to include, then select one of the 
wizards. For example, choosing Personal Home 
Page will present you with these questions. If you 
remember, back in Chapter 1 we were presented 
with the dilemma of what we wanted to include on 
our Web site. Well now all we need to do is answer 
these questions and a rather nice Web page will 
appear for very little effort. 
The page produced probably won't match your needs completely, but 
it is easy to modify the skeleton provided. For example, here we can: 
• change the background 
colour from grey; 
• add a picture; 
• delete any bullets that 
are no longer required; 
• change the text; 
• include a table; 
• add a hypertext link .

Summary 
48 
In this chapter we have seen many different techniques that we can 
use to include text on our Web page. Text is simple to include and 
unless formatting is required, doesn't even need any special tags. 
Using the numerous options available, text can be aligned and high-
lighted and some browsers even allow your text to blink. 
We can now start to practise good Web page design and include 
hidden comments with every document and standard reference 
information at the bottom of every page. 
HTML doesn't have to be crafted by hand and we saw examples of two 
popular software products which can make the job of generating Web 
pages considerably easier. 
Useful techniques to practise now include: 
D 
experimenting with the different options for aligning text; 
D 
using paragraphs; 
D 
create a default template for comments which is included in 
every Webdocument you create; 
D 
using different heading levels and try some nested headings; 
D 
decide what reference information should be written at the 
bottom of every Web page; 
D 
investigate whether any software products like FrontPage 
Express are available for your use.

font size 
<fONT> 
Size= 
Color= 
face= 
so 
So far we have displayed text and seen how to emphasis it, but there 
is another tag available, <FONT> which allow us to specify the size 
of the font, its colour and the actual font. Changing these is another 
way of bringing text to the readers' attention. 
The <FONT> tag changes the appearance of all following text until 
changed by another <FONT> tag, or the settings are restored to their 
defaults with the closing </FONT> tag. 
The font can be displayed in a range of sizes ranging from 1 to 7, 
where 7 is the largest and 1 is the smallest. These size numbers bear 
no resemblance to the font sizes in word-processors. Alternatively, 
the font size can be increased or decreased by using the plus ( +) or 
minus (-) sign and a value, e.g. <FONT SIZE = + 2>. 
The colour of the text being displayed can be controlled by speci-
fying this attribute. The value can be given in words or hexadecimal 
numbers -
see page 52 for more details on how to use this. 
The font can be specified using this attribute. Use this with care. If 
your readers don't have the font on their system, this will not work. 
The standard Windows fonts are a fairly safe bet. 
Tip 
If different styles are needed for headings, lists 
and text, use the <STYLE> tag-seepage 70.

Using colour 
<BODY> 
Bgcolor= 
Text= 
Color= 
S2 
The use of coloured text or different background colours on a Web 
page, can totally change the look of what might be a drab Web site. 
One word of caution though, choose your colours wisely, or no one 
will be able to read your page! The background and default text 
colours are defined in the <BODY> tag. Text colour can also be set 
in the <FONT> tag. 
This is a tag that specifies how the main text should be displayed. 
To control the background and text colour, the clauses Bgcolour= 
or Text= are specified, followed by a colour code which represents 
the colour. The text must be closed at the end with a </BODY> tag. 
Specifies the background colour.

Used within a <FONT> tag to specify the colour which must be used 
for the text. 
In all of these, the colour is specified using a keyword such as "red", 
or using one of the codes shown below. This is a very basic list of 
colours, but it is possible to define a whole range of different ones. 
Unless a special colour is required, it is best to use the name "red" 
than its code "#FFOOOO". (Note the # sign at the start!)

Lists 
Lists are used extensively on Web pages, because they are ideal for 
presenting options to the reader, such as in this example by the AA. 
Within HTML, several different types of lists may be created, 
therefore the possibilities for their use is quite extensive. 
In HTML the list options are: 
• 
unnumbered with a bullet of your choice; 
• 
numbered using your numbering scheme; 
• 
definition list. 
Several tags are needed to create a list of items. The first tag 
determines the type of list, such as numbered. Then each line in the 
list begins with the <LI> tag. Finally the list is concluded with the 
terminating tag for the list type. 
Lists can also be created by using tables or paragraphs, which is 
sometimes more suitable than using these tags. 
S3 

<UL> Unnumbered list 
An unnumbered list with a bullet. The default bullet is a filled-in 
circle, but by adding TYPE= you can change it to a square, disc 
or circle. The list is terminated with a </UL> tag. 
<LH> List header 
Define the header for a list, closed with a </LH> tag. 
<LI> List Entry 
All entries in the list, irrespective of the type, are specified using the 
<LI> tag. The text is placed after the tag and there is no closing tag. 
<0L> Numbered list 
Creates a list of numbered items and is closed with a </OL> tag. The 
use of the TYPE= clause within the tag enables you to specify the 
numbering style. By default it uses ordinary numbers and starts 
with 1, but A generates letters, I large Roman numerals and i small 
Roman numerals. 
• 
You can use START= to specify the first number in the list. 
• 
An item can also be given a specific value using the VALUE= 
clause in the <LI> tag. 
• 
The numbers can also be changed by including the clause 
SKIP= inside the <LI> tag. 
<DL> Definition List 
S4 
If a glossary is required, then this would be a good use for a 
Definition List. Start with the tag <DL>. Each term is defined using 
the <DT> tag and described using the <DD> tag. All of the tags must 
be closed with the appropriate </DL>, </DT> and </DD> tags. 

An example of an 
unnumbered list: 
this page on the 
1999 Solar 
Eclipse enables 
the reader to find 
out the chances of 
seeing the eclipse 
in their area.

Ordered List

An ordered list can start with any value as per the example shown 
below. Any list can be indented and each list can have its own 
numbering scheme. Although the examples shown here use numbers, 
an ordered list could contains letters or roman numerals.

Tip 
It's a good idea to indentthe tags. 
This will make the code easier to 
read and will also look like a list. 

Definition List 
At first glance a definition list could be mistaken for a heading and 
indented text, where each block of text is placed in its own paragraph. 
The size of the font for the heading or text can be changed using the 
<FONT SIZE> tag so that it emulates the heading tag. 
A nice example using a definition list can be found at the Sustrans 
site at http://www.sustrans.org. uk/ although at first glance one 
would think it is a bulleted list.

Lists without Ii st tags 
Lists do not have to be created using the tags just described. Here 
are some examples of Web sites that look at first glance, as though 
list tags are in use. However, if you review the source for these pages 
then you will see that other techniques have been used. 
For example, these very nice lists on the Disability Net page, have 
been created using a table.

If you have an HTML document with many different sections, you 
can draw a line between them, or anywhere in the page, using the tag 
<HR>. 
The tag is called <HR> because it stands for horizontal ruler. It has 
no closing tag. A simple <HR> generates a line across the page. But 
you can also specify within the tag the following parameters: 
Size of the line 
Length of the line, in pixels or as a percentage of the window width. 
Position of line, such as left, right or center. 
Will fill in the line so that it stands out. 
Therefore to draw a thick line that stretches across 75% of the page 
from the centre, the tag would be: 
<HR SIZE=5 WIDTH=75% ALIGN=CENTER> 
Tip 
Manv people prefer to use an image for a line rather 
than the <HR> tag. Using this method vou can create 
verv colourful lines and banners.

Tables 
62 
One of the most commonly-used structures found on a Web page is 
a table. Tables are popular with Web designers because they 
provide a mechanism to layout text and graphics. There are many 
ways they can be used on a Web page, for instance: 
• 
to display the programme for the meetings of a group; 
• 
to include graphics; 
• 
anything that needs to be written in columns; 
• 
creating navigation areas. 
When you think of a table, probably the first usage that comes to 
mind is to display simple columns of information, like the Web page 
shown below, which details the current episode of a TV show being 
aired in the different TV regions.

Simple table 
<TABLE> 
Tables consist of cells, arranged in rows. Cells will normally fall into 
columns, but their widths can be set individually if required. 
The first example of a table will contain two rows, two columns and 
no headings. A number of tags are required to define a table, 
commencing with the <TABLE> tag. Our first table is plain with no 
border or lines inside it, later ones will have borders and headings. 
As several tags are required to create a table, it is recommended 
that they are indented. Remember, it is the tags that control the 
appearance of the page when it is viewed; indenting just makes the 
source code easier for you to read. 
You start a table with the tag <TABLE> and end with </TABLE>. 
Within these tags, other tags are required to define the headings, 
rows and the individual cells in the table. 
<TR> Tobie row 
The start of each row in the table is defined by the <TR> tag and the 
end by the <ffR> tag. 
<TD> Tobie data 
64 
The data for each cell in the table, is enclosed within the tags <TD> 
and closed with the </TD> tag. A cell ican contain text or a graphic, 
or be left empty. 
Text can be positioned using the ALIGN= clause and formatted 
using any of the options such as <B> to bold or <BR> for a new line.

Borders and headings 
Border= 
This optional clause within the <TABLE> tag places a border around 
the table. The thickness of the border is defined using a number. In 
our example, the value of 10 makes the table stand out like a button. 
A little experimentation may be required to obtain the desired 
appearance. The spacing around the borders is controlled using the 
clause CELLSPACING=. 
<CAPTION> Tobie Heading 
A table can be given its own heading using the <CAPTION> tag. 
This is closed with the </CAPTION> tag. 
<TH> Tobie column heading 
Each column within a table can be allocated its own heading. The 
formatting options we met previously, such as ALIGN= can be used. 
A column heading is usually defined in the first row and must be 
closed with the </TH> tag. 
Other format options 
66 
The space between the cell and the table can be controlled with the 
CELLSPACING= clause within the <TABLE> tag and the space 
between the sides of the cell using the CELLPADDING= clause. 
Text can be made to span multiple columns by using the clause 
COLSPAN= inside the <TD> tag or multiple rows using ROWSPAN=. 
The width of a column can be controlled using the WIDTH= clause 
inside the <TH> or <TD> tag. The width can be specified using an 
absolute value or as a percentage relative to the size of the table. For 
example, to create a column that is a quarter of the width of the table 
enter <TD WIDTH=25%>. Anyone including graphics in a table will 
want to use the WIDTH= clause to control the column size.

By default, the browser will set the table width to fit the screen. 
Alternatively, the width of the table can be controlled by adding the 
clause WIDTH= inside the <TABLE> tag, where the width of the 
table is defined in either pixels or as a percentage of the window 
size. This is the technique to use, when a small table is needed. 
When text is being defined, the clause ALIGN= is used to specify the 
position of the text and V ALIGN=, is used for the vertical alignment 
of the text, with values of top, bottom, or centre. 
There are some other formatting options available for users of 
Internet Explorer 4. To the <TABLE> tag you can add the clause 
RULES=, to specify how the cells inside the table are displayed. A 
value of ALL, which is the default, displays all the internal borders, 
NONE, displays no borders, COLS only displays the columns and 
ROWS displays only the border between rows. 
The FRAME= clause, which is placed inside the <TABLE> tag 
determines how the table frame is displayed. Possible values are 
VOID, no sides, ABOVE, only the top line, BELOW, only the bottom 
line, HSIDES, top and bottom, UIS only the left side, RHS, only the 
right side, VSIDES, both left and right sides and BORDER is all four 
sides which is the default. 
An important point to remember when using any HTML extensions 
that are specific to a browser, is that if your reader isn't using that 
browser, then your page will not be displayed exactly as it was 
designed.

Tables in Netscape Composer 
To construct a table requires a number of tags, therefore this is a 
good time to consider using a tool like Netscape Composer. The 
first step is to click on the Table icon and the display shown below 
appears. Here you define the characteristics of the table such as 
number of columns and rows, whether you want a border, the 
background colour and various alignment options. Simply answer 
these questions, click on the OK button and the table appears as 
shown opposite. 
Remember all those tags we had to remember and how tricky it was 
to construct a line in the table? Using this tool, that is now a thing 
of the past.

When our table appears, to enter something into a cell simple click 
on it and if it's, text start typing. Frequently tables without borders 
hold graphics and they can also be specified here. 
To include a graphic in the table, position yourself in the cell where 
the graphic is to be placed and click on the image icon and a 

window is provided which requests the name of the graphic file. 
Simply fill in the details about the image and it will appear. 
Cells in the table could also include a link to another Web site or 
page which is created by clicking on the link icon.

What is nice about this approach, is that really complex HTML is 
being written behind the scenes, but you can see how the table will 
appear while you are constructing it. In addition, all the table 
options are visible when completing the dialog box, thereby 
reminding the designer of what can be done using a table. 
Another approach to consider is create just the table using this or 
another editor. Once you are happy with the look of it, save the 
HTML and then insert this code into your master document.

Tables in f rontPage Express 
Tip 
The method used to create a table in Front Page Express is very 
similar to the approach used by Netscape Composer. 
Click on the table icon that appears in the main window, . 
then to specify how big the table is to be, click on the l"r===='=:::'I! 
right-most box that represents the size that you want, 
or point to the top left box and drag to set the size - if 
you want more than 5 columns or 4 rows, just keep ..--.......... 051
--=--~-=---=- 1 
dragging off the grid! 
Alternatively, open the Table menu and select Insert Table. The 
dialog box shown opposite is displayed where you answer a few 
simple questions such as number of rows and columns and whether 
borders are needed. Clicking on the OK button, the table is instantly 
displayed on your Web page. Once the table is visible, to include 
text in the table, click on the desired cell and start typing. 
The characteristics of the table or cell can be modified at any time 
by using the right mouse button. This will display a another dialog 
box where you can specify the size of the borders and colours. 
If table headings are required, they should be entered as per any 
text in the table and don't forget that at any time the HTML source 
for the table can be displayed. 
Specify rows and columns 
Initially a verytinytable is displayed, but as 
text is entered or graphics are included, the 
table will automatically increase in size to 
accommodate the data it must display.

Style sheets 
Before the introduction of style sheets, it wasn't easy to define all 
the characteristics of a Web page when the default display attributes 
were unsuitable. With the introduction of the <STYLE> tag, it is 
now possible to define precisely how information is to be displayed. 
It is part of the HTML 4.0 specification, therefore it may not be 
supported by your browser if you have an older version. 
A style sheet can be included in your document, or it may be 
referenced from an Internet site. There are many options that can 
be included in a style sheet and a good external reference can be 
found on the Web at http://www.w3j.com/5/s2.lie.html 
Ideally, the style sheet should be defined at the start of the document, 
but this is not mandatory. It must be placed before you want to use 
any of the defined styles. It begins with the <STYLE> tag and closes 
with the </STYLE> tag. Within these, you describe the options for 
each of the formatting tags. Therefore to specify how a level 1 
heading is to appear, you write Hl then specify the options within 
{ } brackets. Each option is separated with a semicolon and the 
format for each option is specified after the colon. For example, 
heading 1 must appear with a font size of 22pt, using the Courier 
font and in black, is defined in the style sheet as 
Hl { font: 22pt Courier; color:black } 
All of the HTML tags may be controlled in this fashion, which means 
that we can use different fonts and text colours for each level and 
paragraph. Other items that can be controlled include the 
background colour and image and the bullet to be used on lists. For 
the Web page itself, an extensive number of options are available to 
control margin size, space around the borders and sizing and for 
lists. It doesn't matter in which order the options are written. 
Only one style sheet can be assigned to an HTML document, but 
each document can use its own style sheet. Once style sheets are in 
use, rather than repeat all of these tags in every document, the style 
sheet is stored with your Web documents and referenced directly 
from the HTML document instead. (See page XX for more on this.)

Using a style sheet will enable you to format a Web page using 
options that are not available in regular HTML. Since it is also easier 
to customise the tags, it is possible to create some rather nice 
effects using the different options. Shown here are some more style 
sheet options. 
To specify the background image and how it should repeat use 
BODY { background-image: url{at_work.gif); background-repeat: repeat} 
Several repeat options are available: repeat; repeat-x only repeat 
horizontally; repeat-y only repeat vertically; and norepeat to only 
display the image once. 
Here are some more text formatting options. Define a margin that 
starts 1 inch from the left, create a thick border around the text, set 
the text colour to green and set the style of the text so that the first 
letter is shown in capitals. 
P {margin: 1 in; border-width:thick; color: green; text-transform:capitalize} 
Below we changed the style of the font to italic, set the thickness of 
the font to 100, but the value could be anything up to 900 and 
request that the text is indented by 25% of the browser window size. 
P {font-style:italic; font-weight:100; text-indent:25%} 
The margins can be controlled using the following clauses where 
the values are specified either as a percentage or as an actual 
measurement, such as 0.5 inches. 
P {margin-left: 1 in; margin-right: 2in; margin-top:25%; 
margin-bottom: 10%} 
Tip 
If you want several pages to use the same 
styles, you can create a default style sheet 
and link this from the pages. See page 111.

Summary 
76 
In this chapter we have see more techniques that can be used in our 
Web document for including text. Some of them such as lists and 
tables, have been introduced for text, but can be used for other 
things. Style sheets are easy to include in our documents and 
provide a means to create some nice effects on our Web page. 
Now you should be ready to try writing some more HTML to achieve 
the following: 
D 
change the fonts and colours; 
D 
display information in list; 
D 
use a table to display some text; 
D 
create several Web documents and then jump from one 
document to the next; 
D 
identify external Web sites that could be referenced from 
your Web site; 
D 
use some style sheets on your documents so that they look 
different from typical Web pages that you have seen.

Why use graphics 
78 
Web sites that comprise of only text, may be informative, but are 
considered 'boring'. Commercial sites are typically, bright and lively 
using graphics to promote their products or services. There are many 
ways pictures can be used on a Web page for instance: 
• 
to show a scene or provide information; 
• 
an icon; 
• a background; 
• for graphs; 
• to display a logo; 
• to display a product; 
• banner; 
• line; 
• navigation map. 
Graphics are used extensively on Web sites because many designers 
feel that a picture can say a thousand words. Suppose you are car 
manufacturer, a potential buyer is interested in not only the technical 
specification of the car and accessories, but also its appearance. By 
providing pictures of the car at different angles, they can take a virtual 
tour of the vehicle from the comfort of their chair. 
On a personal Web site, if your family is scattered around the globe. 
Rather than send them the latest pictures of the family, you could 
keep them on your Web site and advise them everytime it is updated. 
An important point to consider when designing your Web page, is the 
size of each of the graphic files. If your audience is likely to be people 
at home then bear in mind the sometimes slow speed of the Internet, 
and the high probability that they are not using the latest and fastest 
modems, they could wait a long time displaying the images. There-
fore, if this is a commercial site, you could easily lose business. 

Graphic file formats 
Glf 
JPEG 
There are a number of different file formats in which graphics can be 
stored such as PCX, TIFF or BMP. Web browsers like their graphics 
stored in GIF or JPEG formats, neither of which can be produced by 
Windows Paintbrush. However, this is not a problem as there are 
shareware tools which will convert files from PCX or BMP formats to 
GIF or JPEG format. These include, Wingif and Paint Shop Pro. 
GIF files are extremely popular on Web sites. Although they are 
limited to 256 colours, they still display good images. The compres-
sion on GIF files is not the best, therefore they won't be stored using 
the fewest bytes. However, they are ideal on Web pages for simple, 
low-resolution tasks, such as icons, logos and low resolution pic-
tures. 
The JPEG format stores an image using millions of colour and it 
compresses the image much better than the GIF format. Therefore 
your images occupy less storage space, are smaller to transfer, but 
take a little longer to display because of the more complex compres-
sion algorithms in use. JPEG images are ideal for displaying high 
quality colour images, especially photographic quality or any image 
that needs more than 256 colours. 
Tip 
To save space, vour Internet provider will most likelv 
have setup a librarv of images that vou can use. These 
mav prove a suitable alternative to creating vour own 
especiallv for icons. 
79 

Including graphics 
A graphic can be included anywhere on a Web page, but you cannot 
specify exactly where it is to be located, unless you use a table which 
provides a little more control. There are a number of extra qualifiers 
which can be added to the basic image tag, which will affect how the 
text is positioned around the graphic, but not the position of the 
graphic itself. 
<IMG> Image 
The <IMG> tag is used to place a graphic on a Web page. To specify 
the name of the graphic, you must add the parameter SRC= 
SRC= Source file 
ALIGN= 
80 
Specify the name of the file containing the picture. Normally one only 
has to give the file name, but should it be located in another directory, 
then you must add the full path name into the SRC= clause. 
When the HTML document is loaded onto the Internet, you will also 
have to copy all the graphic files as well. Your HTML document may 
only occupy 2-5 kilobytes, but each graphic file could be 20Kb or 
more. Therefore you may only have to include several image files 
before you exceed a quota set by your service provider. However, 
many service providers are generous and off er 5, even 25 megabytes 
of storage which should allow many graphics files to be displayed. 
Previously we saw how to align text using the ALIGN= clause. This 
clause can also be used for an image. It specifies how the text around 
the picture is to be positioned. The options available are Top, Middle 
and Bottom. If there is no text on the line, then you can use it to place 
the image on the left or right.

When a graphic cannot be found, browsers 
will display a question mark like this one 
Tip 
You must specifv the name of the 
graphic file, exactlv as it appears in 
the file svstem, using upper and 
lowercase letters as shown in the 
file name. If vou do not, the link 
mav not work when the files are 
uploaded to the Web server. 
81 

Text and spaces around a graphic 
HSPACE= 
VSPACE= 
A graphic on its own may not be sufficient to convey the full message. 
For instance, look at the example opposite. If you only saw the star, 
would you know that this meant clicking here gives you information 
on the Southampton Astronomical Society? Probably not. Therefore, 
it is quite common to include some text around a graphic or alternative 
text that is displayed if the graphic is not displayed. 
When graphics are displayed, no blank space is put around them. This 
can have the effect of making the graphics appear too close together,. 
To overcome this problem, two parameters can be added to the 
<IMG> tag to specify how much space is to be left around the graphic. 
The number specified is in terms of pixels and a number in the range 
5 to 30 is usually suitable. 
Reserves horizontal space on the left and right of the graphic. 
Reserves vertical space at the top and bottom of the graphic. 
Width= Height= 
82 
Used together, height and width specify the size of the image. The 
browser will automatically adjust the image to fit in the size specified. 
The values can be given in pixels, or as a percentage of the width or 
height of the browser window. 
Tip 
Be prepared to experiment with different values for 
Hspace and Vspace to get the desired effect.

How many times have you visited a Web site and had to stare at a blank 
screen while you are waiting for the image to appear? At the worst 
sites, the visitor has to wait for all the graphics to be displayed before 
they can do anything. If your visitors are patient, they will not mind 
waiting, otherwise they are likely to give heavy-graphics sites a miss 
and go elsewhere. Some surfers even turn off images downloading. 
The solution to this problem is to add some text to your graphic tags, 
so that text is displayed if the graphic has not been loaded. 
Tthe simplest way to do this is by adding theALT= clause to the <IMG> 
tag. Its text is then displayed as an alternative to the graphic. 
Pop-up text produced by JavaScript 
Tip 
You can also use JavaScript to link text to graphics 
(see Chapter 8 and JavaScript Made Simple). 

Transparent images 
Using transparent GIF files on your Web site can add some very nice 
effects. When an image is saved as transparent, using a tool such as 
Paint Shop Pro, one selected colour will not be displayed. In Paint 
Shop Pro, you can specify that the transparent colour be automatically 
set to the background colour on the Web page. In the example below, 
the image is saved with a background colour of grey set to transparent. 
When it is displayed the background colour is white - the screen 
background colour. An ideal use for transparent images is a logo.

fast graphic display 
A Web page with a lot of graphics can take a long time to load. If the 
user has to wait for the entire image to be displayed before they can 
findout what it is, this can be very frustrating, especially if they have 
a slow Internet connection or the Internet is running slowly. 
The way to overcome this problem is to use GIF files which are saved 
as 89a-Interlaced type. An interlaced GIF file appears to the reader as 
if it is coming into focus slowly. It first appears hazy and then 
gradually the image appears. This techniqueis particularly useful 
with large images that may take some time to load. 
Creating interlaced Glfs 
86 
Creating interlaced GIFs is not difficult as long as you have the right 
tool, and Paint Shop Pro is an ideal tool for the job. All you have to do 
is select the right type (GIF) and sub-type (Version 89a - interlaced) 
when you save the file. 
Select Save As 
Use a tool like Paint Shop Pro which 
supports 89a-lnterlaced type files 
Name the file 
Save as a GIF 

Using your photos 
One of the attractions of a Web page is the ability to share personal 
information with farflung family, or interests with fellow enthusiasts. 
Would you like to show those family snaps to distant relatives? Or in 
the commercial world, would you like to display your products. Here 
are three different ways to put photographs on your Web site. 
l<odak Photo CD 
Kodak Photo CD allows you to take a picture with an ordinary camera 
and from the negative, have the picture transferred onto a computer 
CD. Many photographic shops offer this service, which typically takes 
about a week. Programs like Paint Shop Pro can read the CD and 
display the picture. One hundred images will fit on a CD, and when 
reduced in size and converted to JPEG or GIF format they are suitable 
for inclusion on a Web page. 
Digital cameras 
Scanners 
Digital cameras are a recent innovation and are rapidly growing in 
popularity. They are very like ordinary cameras to use, but don't have 
any film and you can see the results immediately, so if you don't like 
the picture you can throw it away. A digital camera can only store a 
limited number of pictures and then they must be transferred to a 
computer. This is achieved by connecting the camera to the computer 
by a cable and using its companion transfer software. You can then 
view the pictures again and decide whether to discard or keep them. 
Until recently flat-bed scanners, where you could lay a photograph 
down and have it scanned. were primarily found in commercial 
organisations. Fortunately, they are now available to the home user 
for well under one hundred pounds. 
Using a scanner you can take any photograph, or picture from your 
company's catalogue, capture it using the software provided and 
then save it as a GIF image which is then displayed on your Web site.

Graphics in tables 
88 
Many Web designers prefer to place their graphics inside a table, 
because the table provides a means of placing multiple graphics on a 
line with spacing and text. 
A graphic is inserted in a table by placing the <IMG> tag with all the 
graphic options between the table tags <TD> and </TD>. The only 
problem with using this approach is that the HTML required to 
implement this, is a bit difficult to read. 
When using a table for the graphics, you can disable the border so that 
the reader doesn't realise that a table is being used. Also, take 
advantage of clauses such as ROWSPAN= and COLSPAN= to force the 
image across multiple columns or rows. 
Many sites use tables and a good example of graphics on a Web page 
inside a table is the one below from the Yellow Pages site. 
v 
ru ~ 
A table doesn't have to include many images. At the NASA Eclipse Web 
site, a single table is used to display the banner at the top of the page 
(see opposite). The second example, from the Armagh Observatory 
Web site, uses one table to display the two images of Comet Hyakutake 
and a different table to store just the image for Comet Hale-Bopp.

Graphics using HTML editors 
Netscape Composer 
In Netscape Composer a graphic is included by clicking on the graphic 
icon. This opens the dialog box shown below, and here you specify the 
name of the file to be displayed. The added benefit of using this 
approach is that you can also specify how the text is to be wrapped 
around the image, the alignment and spacing of the image plus other 
options. 
The same technique is used whenever a graphic is included on the 
Web page, such as inserting it into a table. This is also the place where 
you would specify that the graphic is to be used as a background 
image (see page 93).

To include a graphic using FrontPage Express, click on the image icon 
to specify the file. The options for placing the graphic on the page are 
not included on this form. Instead, use the right mouse button and 
click while over the image to display the Image Properties page. Then 
click on the Appearance tab to specify how the image is to be placed. 
The image is aligned on the page by clicking on the alignment options 
that are used for text paragraphs. As for how the text wraps around 
the image, you may not be able to create the desired effect with this 
cutdown version of the tool. However, that shouldn't dissuade you 
from using it, because you can always modify the generated HTML.

Backgrounds 
There is another way to liven up your Web page and that is to include 
a background image. These are usually small images which are repeated 
across and down the page. There are some wonderful ones around on 
the Internet or you can create your own. It's worth checking if your 
service provider has a library of background images that you can use. 
If not, then any JPEG or GIF image can be included, although not all are 
suitable. For example, the background shown opposite for this Babylon 
5 Web site is perfect. It sets the scene nicely for the topic to be 
discussed. 
<BODY BACl<GROUND = > 
To use a background image, add the clause BACKGROUND= to the 
<BODY> tag at the top of the HTML document. Within the quotes, 
specify the name of the graphic file to be used as the background. 
Netscape provide some backgrounds at: 
http://www.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/bg/backgrounds.html 
which you could reference directly from your Web site. However, this 
isn't recommended as it will make your Web site slower to display. 
Instead download the image to your site and save it as a separate file. 
The clever design of the Babylon 5 background hides the fact that this 
is a repeated image. Sometimes you want the repeat to show up, to 
create a deliberate pattern, as in this example from the Southampton 
Astronomical Society.

Background using a Style Sheet 
On page 75, we met the idea of setting up a background image in a 
style sheet. Here's an example of this in use.

Creating a Background 
A background image can be created using any image tool. For exam-
ple, this background image for the Southampton Astronmical Society 
was created using CorelDraw, simply by writing the text, then stretch-
ing the text using the tools provided and then changing the colour to 
a very light shade of gray so that it does not obscure the text or 
graphics that will be on the page. 
When creating a background, it is very important to select colours or 
images that will blend into the background. For example, if these 
words were in black, then any black text on the page would be very 
hard to see. 
Another factor to consider is the size of the image, the smaller the 
image, the more times it will repeat on the page. 
Finally the image should be saved as a GIF file and then moved into the 
folder with all the other HTML documents. 
Tip 
The full FrontPage package contains an excellent 
graphics application - Image Composer. 
9S 

Summary 
96 
We have now seen how to include graphics on our Web page which is 
not difficult, but we do need to consider the type of image and its size 
and whether to use an interlaced file which will come into focus 
gradually. 
Backgrounds can be easily added to our image and we can create our 
own so that they are suitable for the topic under discussion. 
Useful techniques to practise would be: 
D 
including a graphic, individually and in lists and experiment 
with the different spacing options and use of alternative text; 
D 
create some transparent images and interlaced gif images; 
D 
try different types of backgrounds and see how some 
backgrounds are not suitable because it prevents the text 
and other graphics being readily visible.

Jumping 
A Web page may contain information on a number of topics which 
is often presented in the form of a list. HTML provides a mechanism, 
a hypertext link, which allows the reader to jump to a certain point 
in a page - or to any other page, in the same set or elsewhere. 
Any document that is long or broken into sections should contain 
hypertext links, which can be located in headings, text, bulleted lists 
or in image maps. 
To jump from one place to another in an HTML document requires 
two tags: 
e 
<A HREF=> 
e 
<A NAME=> 
<A HREf= ''# ''> Jump from 
This tag is positioned at the point you wish to jump from. It is given 
the name (with a preceding #) of the point you wish to jump to, and 
can be enclosed in "quotes" if desired, e.g. <A HREF = "#85">. 
Immediately following the tag, specify some text to explain where 
you will be jumping too. This text is highlighted by the browser so 
choose something meaningful. Close with the </A> tag. 
<A NAME=" "> Jump To 
98 
This tag is placed in the document at the point which you want to 
jump to. The name must match the name specified at the jump 
point, but without the preceding#. The tag is closed using the </A> 
tag. 
In the example opposite, we give the jump point the label BS and 
then place the text Babylon S after it. Later in the document at the 
point where the text on Babylon S starts, we place the label BS inside 
the <A> tag. 
The technique described here can only be used to jump to points 
within the same HTML document, a very slightly different approach 
is required to jump to another HTML document.

Multiple pages 
A Web site usually comprises of multiple pages, each one a separate 
HTML document. With this approach, documents are smaller, and 
therefore easier to maintain and faster to retrieve and display. 
Commercial sites in particular use many Web pages. For example, 
from this page from the Oracle Corporation, you can move to other 
areas of the company such as products or events. It is not uncommon 
for each product to have its own page or pages.

To move from one Web page to another, the tag <AHREF="" >is used 
with the name of the target HTML page written inside the quotes. For 
example, to jump to a page called "self.html", the tag would be: 
<A HREF= "self.html">Some text </A> 
To return to your home page, add another <A HREF> tag with the 
name of the home page document.

Linking to other pages 
One of the nice features of the Internet is the ability to jump from 
one page to another, using a hypertext link. By referencing other 
Web pages you start to exploit the potential of the Internet. 
Links to Web sites external to your own are desirable for many 
reasons. For example, to provide more information from a specialist 
site, or link to a manufacturer or a special event. Although we shall 
only be looking at jumping from this Web page, remember that you 
can ask people to provide a link to be able to jump to your page. To 
specify a jump point, two pieces of information are needed: 
• 
the Internet address of the place you wish to jump to 
• 
some text or an icon or both to describe the jump point 
A jump point is easy to see on a Web page because it will be 
displayed in a different colour and underlined so that it stands out 
from the other text. 
Jump to <A HREf= " "> 
102 
The <A HREF=> tag is used to define the link to the external site. 
Simply include the Internet address of the place you wish to jump to 
between the quotes. Then add some text to describe where you will 
be jumping to. Finally close the tag with </A>. 
<A HREF="http://www.oracle.com"> Oracle </A> 
If any site is going to include a link to your page, then they would 
have to include an <A HREF=> tag with your address on their Web 
page. 
Tip 
Web sites frequentlv change. It's a good 
idea to regularlv check vour external jump 
points to see thev are still valid.

Jumping with graphics 
Many Web designers seem to avoid using text and like to use 
graphics or icons to jump from one place on a Web page to another. 
Best of all they make the page look good and are fun to use. 
Graphics used as jump points are easy to identify because the 
cursor changes to a hand when placed over them. 
The technique used to jump using a graphic, is the same as jumping 
with text, except the <IMG> tag is included within the <A HREF> 
tag. The browser will automatically associate the picture with the 
jump point. Referring to the example below, to see Alan Bean's new 
print called Homeward Bound, all we have to do is click anywhere 
on the small image of it to learn more about that print and findout 
the price.

Image maps 
106 
How many times have you visited a Web site and been presented 
with a group of icons that you click on to go to different places in the 
site? The icons may be in a strip or a table, or integrated into a more 
free-form picture. If the icons load as a single image, the site is using 
an image map. Image maps offer precise control and the ability to 
navigate using shaped areas - rectangles, circles or polygons. This 
is a very friendly approach to use and makes it very easy for people 
to navigate your Web site. 
A single Web document is not limited to one image map, therefore 
create as many as you require on a Web page. For example, an image 
map could be used at the top of the page for basic Web site 
navigation and further down in the document another image map 
provides access to more detailed information. 
Image maps can be defined in two ways. The map definition can be 
written into the HTML page, alternatively, the definition can be 
stored with as a separate file and referenced from other pages. The 
later approach is for experts; in this book we will show you how to 
create a simple image map within an HTML document.

Using image maps 
There are a number of steps to generating an image map. The only 
difficult one is describing the clickable area. The first step is to 
create the actual image, which can be achieved using your favourite 
graphics tool such as Paint Shop Pro. When complete, this image 
should be saved as a .GIF file. 
Now each area that you want to be able to click on must be defined. 
There are three types of areas; rectangle, polygon and circle. A 
rectangle is defined by its coordinates measured in pixels; upper 
left x, upper left y, lower right x and lower left y. A polygon is 
represented by xl, y2, x2, y2 to xn, yn. Finally a circle is defined 
by the centre x,y coordinates and the radius. Some software tools 
are available to identify the coordinates, a good one is called 
MapEdit (see page 109). Alternatively, you can work them out 
yourself. Define the coordinates, good ones to start with are 0,0,50,50, 
and then display the HTML with the browser. Now run the mouse 
over the image map and note at which point the cursor changes to 
a hand, denoting a jump point. Continue to adjust the coordinates 
until this entire clickable area on the image map has a hand instead 
of a regular cursor. When you have the coordinates for the first 
clickable area, repeat the process for the next area. 
The image map is included in the HTML document using two tags. 
First the <IMG> tag is used to define the actual image map using 
SRC= to define the actual image and the clause USEMAP= to point 
to the map definition and the clause ISMAP so that it knows that the 
graphic is an image map. Use the Height= and Width= clauses to 
control the size of the image map and the clause border=O to 
prevent a border being drawn around the image map. 
Then the map is defined using the <MAP> tag. For each clickable 
area on the map use the tag <AREA>. Inside this tag you must state 
the shape of the area using the SHAPE= clause followed by the 
COORD= clause which specifies the actual area and then finally, 
define the point to jump to using the HREF= clause.

Moped it 
Trying to create an image map using the trial and error method to 
determine the coordinates can be quite time-consuming. Therefore 
consider using a tool like MapEdit, which can be found at http:// 
www.boutell.com/mapedit/. It is available for a 30 day trial and after 
that time it must be registered. Anyone who has to regularly create 
and maintain image maps will like this tool and some may consider 
it to be essential. 
Unfortunately it doesn't get over the problem of first creating the 
image map, but once that is done, it will probably take you less than 
a minute or so to create the map. 
When started, Mapedit asks for the HTML document and identifies 
which image to use from this file. 
1 
Using the mouse, identify each clickable area on the image. 
First click on the icon which corresponds to the type of area, 
e.g. rectangle, then click on the mouse to activate it, and 
drag the mouse across the area to create a box as illustrated 
in the example on the next page. 
2 
Click again to generate the box where you specify the URL. 
3 
Repeat this process for each clickable area and then save the 
HTML document. It will now be complete with a map 
definition. 
Once the image map has been created, the next step is to create the 
HTML document into which the map definition is to be placed. It 
isn't necessary to use the actual HTML document, in fact it is 
probably safer to create a small HTML document into which the 
definition is saved and then the contents of this file are included in 
the actual document. As you can see from our example here, we 
started with very simple HTML that contains only the reference to 
the image map.

Default style sheets 
If your Web site comprised of 30+ pages, no Web designer would 
want to include the style sheet in every document. The solution to 
this problem, is a style sheet which we save once as HTML and then 
call it using the <LINK> tag in every document as illustrated below.

Summary 
112 
In this chapter we have seen more techniques that can be used for 
creating links within a Web page, between the pages of your site and 
to pages on other sites elsewhere on the Web. These links can be 
created simply by attaching them to text or graphics. 
Using image maps we can create a friendly environment and provide 
our visitor with an easy way to navigate our Web site. Simply click 
on an image which represents your area of interest. 
If the same style is required on a set of pages, one style sheet can be 
linked by all pages. 
Try creating some pages with links, using one or more of these 
techniques: 
D 
create several Web documents and then jump from one 
document to the next; 
D 
identify external Web sites that could be referenced from 
your Web site; 
D 
design different types of image maps and create the 
clickable areas.

frames 
This feature is being used extensively, because it allows the screen to 
be split into various areas, each displaying its own information. 
Frames are used in many different ways and it's not everyone's Web 
site that needs them. 
If we look at the Bike Nashbar Web site, we can see that they have 
several frames on their page. The top of the page contains static 
information; the frame on the left provides a list of manufacturers and 
the second frame a list of components. Selecting an item in either of 
those will replace the contents with a list of components and then the 
area that is currently displaying 'bike Nashbar' will change to a 
detailed description of the item you requested. This is a friendly way 
to display information and is very useful to catalogue publishers 
because it enables the readers to quickly review the items of interest.

how you can 
divide up your 
Web page

Three-column outer set, with

Frames can be used in a number of ways to divide our Web page into 
multiple areas and shown above are a few examples of what is 
possible. One important point to remember about frames is that the 
reader doesn't need to be aware of them. They can be extremely 
useful for keeping important parts of the Web page, such as naviga-
tion bars, permanently visible. 
Here is an example of a navigation bar, now imagine keeping that in a 
frame at the bottom of every Web page so that you could visit 
anywhere on the Web site. 
11S 

Simple frame 
The first example is a simple document comprised of two frames and 
display some of the HTML documents that we have already seen 
inside those frames. This is the first time that we have been able to 
include the source from more than one HTML document on a single 
page. The browser will automatically adjust the windows and create 
scroll bars to accommodate the HTML document. 
A number of tags are required to define a frame. 
<fRAMESET > 
<fRAME> 
116 
The frame is defined using the <FRAMESET> tag and is closed with a 
</FRAMESET>. To create a frame that divides the page horizontally, 
then the qualifier ROWS= is used and for a frame which divides the 
page vertically, use COLS=. 
The size of each frame can be set by specifying its size in pixels or as 
a percentage of the total size, or we can use an asterisk, which tells the 
browser to match the size to the remaining space. Therefore, to 
create two frames of equal size that span the rows, you would enter 
ROWS="*,*". To create a document that comprises of three column 
frames, where the first frame takes the default size, the second frame 
is 25% of the document size and the third frame is 200 pixels, the tag 
would be written as <FRAMESET COLS= "* ,25%,200">. 
More complex frames, which span rows and columns are created by 
nesting the <FRAMESET> tags. 
Although it is possible to create a document that comprises of many 
frames, in practice, you will usually only want two or maybe three 
because otherwise the text or graphics may be difficult to read. 
Once the number of frames have been defined, the specifics for each 
frame are defined using the <FRAME> tag. This has no closing tag. 
There is a <FRAME> tag for every framed area on the document. Inside 
it, each frame is given a name, using the NAME= clause. It is advisable 
to choose a name that is easily remembered, because it is this frame 

name that is used to tell HTML into which frame a document is to be 
displayed. 
If the frame is to immediately include some HTML source, then this is 
achieved using the SRC= clause. In our examples overleaf, we can see 
that as the Web page displays the frame, it automatically includes the 
documents that we have specified. 
If you are going to display into a frame later, then you may prefer to 
start by displaying a blank source document, so that every frame 
appears identical. Otherwise you could end up with the default 
background of grey which may spoil the look of your Web page. 
<NOfRAME> 
It is also worth considering that not everybody may be using a 
browser that supports frames. Therefore, they would not be able to 
see the content of your Web page. To overcome this problem, use the 
<NOFRAME> tag. 
Between the <NOFRAME> and </NOFRAME> tag, specify the HTML 
that is to be displayed and this will appear instead of the HTML 
between the <FRAMESET> tags. 
It is probably wise to include only basic HTML and avoid special 
features like image maps and other extensions, so that you can be 
sure that the visitor will be able to see your Web page. 
Tip 
If the frames will not displav using vour browser then 
verifv that the version of vour browser supports frames.

a limited text area.

frames and targets 
In the previous example, only one HTML document was ever loaded 
into the frame. Suppose we have a list of options and depending on 
which item is selected, determines the HTML document that is dis-
played in the frame. This can be achieved using a new clause inside 
the <A> tag where the hyperlink is defined, called target=. 
Target = <frame name> 
The first step is to create an HTML document that defines the frames. 
In the example here we have created three frames and called them 
framel, frame2 and frame3. framel will be used to display the HTML 
document called frametl.htm (which is the source shown opposite 
with the hyperlinks). 
Inside the HTML document frametl.htm, we include a Target= clause 
in the <A> tags and there we specify the names of the frame where the 
linked documents are to be displayed. Don't forget to include the 
HREF= clause to specify which HTML document to use. 
Alternatively the Target clause can contain the keywords; _blank will 
load into a new window, _parent into the parent window and _self into 
the same window.

a frame where its source is displayed.

Nested frames 
Margins 
Scrolling 
In the previous examples, the frames have either be in columns or 
rows, but what if a combination of rows and columns is required? This 
is achieved by creating a nested frame. This is a useful technique to 
learn, because nested frames enabled you to create Web pages where 
there could be a standard banner at the top and bottom and frames 
of information in between. 
There are some other options that can be specified inside the<FRAME> 
tag which enable you to control the margins, scrolling and the size of 
the frame. 
The height and width of the margin in pixels can be specified using the 
MARGINHEIGHT= and MARGINWIDTH= clauses respectively. Choose 
a low value if you want the frame to be invisible or high if a distinctive 
border between the frames is needed. 
By default, a frame is created with scroll bars, which will appear if the 
document cannot be fully displayed in the frame. To turn this feature 
off, you must specify SCROLLING=NO. However, use this option only 
if the text fits exactly in the box, otherwise the reader will not be able 
to see all of the information. 
Change frame size 
122 
If you want to prevent the user from resizing the frame, this can be 
enabled by adding the clause NORESIZE to the <FRAME> tag. 
Tip 
If there is an error in the HTML definition for 
the frame, then the frame is displayed blank.

forms 
Initially Web pages provided information and there was little or no 
interaction with the reader. Today, visitors to a Web site will expect 
to interact with it and one method for achieving this is to use a form. 
This may look just like a paper form, or on some Web sites you may 
not be aware that a form is being completed. Typical uses are: 
• 
surveys 
• 
quotations, such as car insurance 
• 
ordering a product 
• 
searching a Web site 
• 
providing feedback 
Forms can also be used to obtain feedback such as comments. For 
some reason, it seems that people would rather complete a form than 
send e-mail to a complete stranger. With a form, they don't have to 
think, just answer the questions 
Forms are ideal to include on a personal Web page because they 
require very little space. Forms, like tables require a number of tags. 
Therefore, considering using a tool like Front Page Express which has 
a form wizard that you can use to define the form.

mailto: me! 
Before we go any further into forms, we should look at this technique 
that allows a visitor to your Web page to communicate with you via e-
mail. On your page you can display an icon or text which when the 
visitor clicks on, will automatically display their e-mail software with 
your address already completed. They simply enter their text and 
then send the message. A variation on this technique can be used to 
send to you the information that a visitor enters into a form. 
<A HREf=mai Ito: > 
To send mail to yourself, use the <A HREF = mailto: tag followed by 
your e-mail address. Add some text or an icon so that people know 
they will be mailing you. Finally close the tag with </A>. Therefore to 
send e-mail to the author 
<A HREF="mailto:lmhobbs@clara.net"> Mail me </A>

Simple form 
<fORM> 
<INPUT> 
126 
A form can be defined anywhere in the HTML document. When 
defining forms, the <PRE> tag is sometimes very useful, to explicitly 
state how the text is to be displayed. 
The form is defined with the <FORM> tag. Inside the tag you must say 
how you want the contents of the form to be sent to you. The 
recommended method is to have it sent by e-mail which is achieved 
by adding to the tag the parameter METHOD=POST and then ACTION= 
to advise what to do with the data just received. Usually the ACTION= 
would point to a URL for a cgi script or if you wanted to send it via 
email it would be ACTION= "mailto:your e-mail address" 
Therefore 
to send a form to the author the tag would be 
<FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="mailto:lmhobbs@clara.net" > 
To input information into the form, first some text is required to tell 
the reader what to input. This is achieved as if we were writing any 
text in HTML. 
Then to specify the input field, use the tag <INPUT> followed by some 
of these clauses inside the tag. 
NAME= " " to give each piece of information you enter a name 
SIZE= to specify the size of the input string 
SRC= if an image is to be associated with the input area 
TYPE= TEXT for a text field 
ALIGN= for the position of the field. Therefore to define an input field 
for a name that is 40 characters wide would be: 
<INPUT NAME="yourname" SIZE=40 > 
The <INPUT> tag has over a dozen different clauses which may be 
specified and we will see some of these options on the following 
pages.

Tip 
You can test the lavout of 
vour form without con-
necting to vour Internet 
service. But to test receiv-
ing form submissions, vou 
will have to connect to vour 
Internet service, enter 
data and submit the form.

More form options 
form Control using <INPUT TYPE=> 
In the previous example, the only data we could input was text, but it 
can take the following values: 
• 
Text 
• 
Password -
typed text is hidden, ideal for passwords or 
credit card details which you may not want to be displayed on 
a screen 
• 
Checkbox -
used to indicate options 
• 
Submit -
generates a button to submit the form 
• 
Reset -
generates a reset button to clear the form 
• 
File -
can upload a file 
• 
Image -
same as Submit but uses an image for button 
The form on the previous page would never have been sent to anyone 
because it did not have a Submit button which is created using TYPE= 
"Submit", It is always a good idea to include on your form a clear 
button via the TYPE= "Reset", just in case someone makes a mistake. 
<TEXT AREA> 
128 
To create a multi-line area to input text you can use the tag called 
<TEXT AREA>. Inside this tag, specify NAME= for the field name and 
then how many ROWS= in the text field, followed by how many 
COLUMNS= are required. This is closed with the tag </TEXTAREA>. 
Therefore to create a comment area, into a field called comments, 
which has 5 rows of 40 columns, the tag would be as follows: 
<TEXTAREA NAME= "comments" ROWS=5 COLS=40 > 
If you create several text areas on your form, the tab order can be 
controlled by adding the clause T ABINDEX= to this tag.

Checkboxes 
Checkboxes are extremely useful when asking a reader questions. 
Rather than struggling to type in text, they can click on the box that 
is appropriate to them. To create a checkbox use the clause 
TYPE=CHECKBOX inside the <INPUT > tag. 
Select from a list 
In one of the previous examples we saw a drop-down list of entries 
from which the user could select. This technique is used frequently 
and is achieved using the tags <SELECT> and <OPTION>. 
First give the <SELECT> tag with optional clauses NAME= and SIZE= to 
determine the number of choices the reader will see. 
Then for each item in the list use the <OPTION> tag with a VALUE= 
clause with the value and text associated with that value. Finally close 
the list with the </SELECT> tag. 
Limits on values 
There are times when you want to control the value a field may take. 
This is possible by adding the clause MIN= and MAX= and a 
TYPE=RANGE to the <INPUT> tag. 
Behind the scenes 
130 
When you press the submit button what actually takes place? The 
contents of your form are sent to the place specified by the ACTION= 
clause inside the <FORM> tag which is usually a CGI script. The CGI 
program processes the information received and then passes back 
the results to the browser that sent them as an HTML document.

form created by f rontPage Express 
Microsoft FrontPage Express simplifies the job of creating a form by 
providing a wizard that takes you through all the steps. 
It begins by asking you to name the form document and to provide a 
title for the form, which is displayed at the top of the page. Next you 
select the type of information that you would like people to enter on 
your form. FrontPage offers a number of choices, which is nice, 
because it means that you don't have to think about what to include. 
In this example we selected Personal details. Now that doesn't mean 
that you have to have all those fields, because the next window asks 
you to select which ones are required.

Once all the fields on the form have been selected, it asks you how you 
would like them presented, such as in a list, or as in our example, using 
ordinary paragraphs. At the bottom of each window on the wizard, 
you may have noticed a rectangular box that is starting to fill up, 
rather like a gauge. The purpose of this is to let you know how far 
through the wizard process you are. 
When you click on the Finish button, the form then appears in the 
main FrontPage Express window. Don't forget that you can then 
customise the form to your own requirements before you save it. 
By default all pages are created with a grey background but most 
people change this colour. To do this, click on Format on the strip 
menu and then select Background.

Summary 
134 
The use of frames enables the screen to be split in such a way that 
different types of information can be displayed. This technique is 
often used on Web sites where you can place orders, simply select 
from the left and see the detail on the right. 
So far all the techniques we have seen have involved the visitor to our 
Web site, reading and clicking on areas to obtain information. Now we 
have learnt some techniques that enables us to interact with the 
visitor. Using a form we can interact with people and obtain 
information. This could be as simple as finding out who visited our 
page to receive an order for goods that a company sells. 
Useful techniques to practise would be: 
0 
investigate the use of frames and determine whether 
horizontal or vertical frames are best for your Web site; 
0 
create some forms, experimenting with the different options 
and understand how to interpret the results when they are 
sent back to you. 
Take note 
f!1 
~ 
The responses from forms are sent back encoded, so it's a little trickv to 
read, but bv no means impossible. If vou plan to do anvthing serious with 
forms then another component is required to handle the data, which is 
called CGI which stands for Common Gatewav Interface. A CGI program 
mav have alreadv have been written to perform the task that vou need, 
otherwise vou will have to write vour own CGI scripts and manv books have 
been written on this subject.

What is sound? 
136 
Probably the first thing you do when you meet someone is say 'Hello'. 
Therefore, why shouldn't a visitor to your web site be greeted with a 
welcome or music. For instance, visit the Chrysler corporation web 
site at www.chryslercars.com and you will hear some nice music. 
Using sound is not difficult, yet few sites implement it on their web 
page. Many commercial sites are now realising the potential of comm-
unication by sound so that instead of seeing the text of an interview, 
- which they would probably not read in its entirety -
Web site 
visitors can listen to someone's voice and have the benefit of hearing 
the tones and accents in it. For example, at the World Wrestling 
Federation site, you can hear the news for the last four weeks. 
All that is required to listen to a sound file is a sound card, speakers 
or headphones and a browser configured to play the file. Like pic-
tures, sound is stored on a computer in several different formats, the 
most popular of which is .WAY. 

Many sites make use of the Real Audio browser plug-in, which allows 
you to start listening to the sound file before it has been received in 
its entirety. As the data is received, it is played back, and provided 
there are no data transfer problems, the music or other sound should 
be heard without interruptions. To create this type of file you will 
have to purchase some software which can be ordered at 
www.real.com. 
Here we can see an the 
Real Audio software in use 
Configuring the browser 
... 
• •••• •·: ••I 
To play sound your browser must be configured to start the software 
that plays that file. For example, a .WAY file can be played by: 
• Media Player supplied with Windows; 
• Soundo'LE in Soundblaster cards; 
Every browser is configured slightly differently, but you will usually 
find it under a section called Options or Preferences. Here it will list 
the different file types such as .WAY and you specify which program 
is to run when this file type is encountered by your browser. 
Take note 
If vou decide to include a greeting on vour Web site, don't 
forget to keep the message or music short or it will take the 
visitor too long to download and thev won't bother to listen. 
137 

Including sound 
Including sound on your Web page is very easy provided you have: 
• 
sound card 
• 
microphone plugged into the mic socket on the sound card 
The first step is to create the sound file which can be created using 
tools such as the Windows utility Sound Recorder. 
Making a sound file 
138 
First start the utility that will record the sound, such as Sound 
Recorder. If it is already running, use the File - New command to startt 
a new file. When you are ready to speak, press the red record button 
on the right-hand side. It will now start recording and you can tell that 
it is picking up your voice because the flat wave sign will increase in 
height. When you have finished, press the stop button. Then to check 
what has been recorded, press the play button and enjoy the sound 
of your own voice. Now save the file as a .WAV type. 
One important point to remember, is to make sure that the sound file 
is stored in the same folder as the HTML document that you are 
reading, otherwise the browser will not be able to find the file to play 
it. Once you have a sound file, it is included on your Web page using 
the <A> tag. 
Not a flat line, so record-
ing or playing back data

Sound Source <~ HREf= > 
A sound file is included by specifying its name within the <A HREF=> 
tag. It is the same process that we saw for defining a jump point, 
except that this time, an actual filename is held within the quotes. 
Don't forget to close the tag with </A>. 
Next to the tag it is a good idea to specify some text to describe what 
the sound file contains and to advise on its size.

Background sound 
Now that you know how to include a sound file on a Web page, you 
could select one to load automatically, although you must be careful 
to choose a sound file that doesn't require too much space, because 
otherwise it will significantly increase the time required to load your 
Web page. 
Sounds can be embedded into the background of a page using special 
tags. Internet Explorer 4 responds to the <BGSOUND> tag. The 
equivalent for Netscape browsers is the <EMBED> tag. 
The sound file that you include could be anything that you like. It 
could be you welcoming the reader, or one of the many sound files 
that are available. 
<BGSOUND> or <EMBED> 
140 
Both tags require the addition of the clause SRC= to define which 
sound file is to be played. If you want to play the sound file a number 
of times, then add the LOOP= clause. If you are using the <EMBED> tag 
then add AUTOSTART=TRUE so that it plays automatically and 
HIDDEN=TRUE so that the player software is not visible. One point to 
bear in mind is that when the browser processes the HTML, nothing 
will appear on the web page to indicate that a sound file is being 
played, that is, it is completely transparent to the surfer. 
If you are looking for some places on the Internet to find some sound 
files then take a look at these sites: 
http://earthstation1.simplenet.com/homepage.html 
http://www.soundamerica.com/ 
http://www.whoopie.com/

Tip 
MIDI files are the most compact 
form of music files, but vou need 
special software to create them.

Including video 
142 
An increasing number of sites on the Web provide videos for the 
reader to download and play. The TV and movie companies were 
quick to realise the value of placing a promotional trailer for this 
week's episode or their latest movie, on the Internet. 
·~STAR TRE~: COOTINJUl.fM - tokil;;,i:li!j:l1;t 
.. 
[ii~ 
On personal Web sites, video is not usually found because until 
recently, video files were expensive to create and storage space was 
limited. Now with service providers offering 25Mb of storage space, 
video is feasible. 
Creating the video itself, is now possible because video cards are 
readily available which capture video from a camcorder, TV or video. 
If you know that in the future you would like to work with video, then 
next time you select a graphics card, choose one that has an add-on 
video card. For example, cards from manufacturer Matrox are designed 
to work with their Rainbow Runner studio card. 
The file types that are usually used for video files is Video for 
Windows .AVI and Quicktime which has an extension of .MOV. 

Video Source <~ HREf= > 
A video file is included using the same technique as per a sound file. 
Specify the name of the video file within the <AHREF=" ">tag. It is the 
same process as for defining a jump point, except that this time, an 
actual filename is held within the quotes. Don't forget to close the tag 
with </A>. 
Next to the tag write text to describe what the video file contains and 
its size, so that a visitor can decide whether or not to download it.

Scrolling message 
Have you ever visited a Web site and seen a scrolling message and 
thought to yourself that you would like to include that on your site? 
Later we will meet Java and JavaScript, and most sites that have a 
scrolling message use one of these to perform the task. 
The good news is that all is not lost becausethere is a tag which will 
create a scrolling message, though it only works when the page is 
viewed in Internet Explorer. 
<MhRQUEE> 
144 
The <MARQUEE> tag creates a scrolling message. The message is 
placed after the <MARQUEE> tag and closed with a </MARQUEE> tag. 
Used in its simplest form, it creates a plain message, But add the 
following clauses inside the <MARQUEE> tag and it will really stand 
out. 
• 
BGCOLOR= to set the background colour. When used in 
conjunction with HEIGHT= and WIDTH= it will create a box that 
stands out on the page. 
• 
Set the height and width of the scrolling are using HEIGHT= 
and WIDTH= . 
• 
The scrolling speed is determined by SCROLLAMOUNT=. 
• 
By default the message scrolls from the left side to the right 
side. You can change this using the DIRECTION= clause. 
• 
To control how many times the message loops around using 
LOOP=. 
• 
By default the message scrolls across the screen, but using 
the BEHAVIOR= clause you can specify slide, scroll or 
alternate. The example here uses alternate which males the 
message appear to bounce back and forth within the defined 
area.

Counters 
146 
Once a Web page is installed, you don't know if anybody is visiting 
your page. Although you may have a form, not every visitor will reply. 
The solution to this problem is to install a counter on your page. 
When you reference a counter on your Web page, the number of visits 
to the page will be held on a computer somewhere on the Internet, 
which may slow down the time required to display the page. 
There are many ways to include a counter on your Web page and 
hopefully your Internet provider will make available a script that you 
can use. If they don't, then a good site to visit where you can register 
your Web page and where they provide clear and easy instructions on 
what to include in your HTML document is: 
http://www.digits.com/web_counter/ 
This site will even let you choose the type of counter you want to 
display and the starting number. 
Using a counter normally involves calling a CGI script, which is a 
program that runs on the server. To use the one at Claranet you would 
specify the following in your HTML document. 
<IMG SRC="/cgi-bin/count.cgi?df=lmhobbs.dat"> 
The counter at Claranet also allows you to specify the type of counter 
and the width of the frame. They even allow you to display a clock with 
the current time or the date instead of a counter. 
Hopefully your service provider will have clear instructions on their 
Web site, Claranet certainly do. Please also remember that the proce-
dure for your service provider could be very different to the one 
shown here which is only for illustration purposes. 
Tip 
The counter can onlv be tested bv uploading 
the HTML document to vour Web site.

Java 
148 
The Internet has gone through revolutionary stages and the introduc-
tion of the Java language definitely qualifies as a major technological 
breakthrough. Developed by Sun Microsystems, Java turns a web 
page from a static document with minimal interaction to a page that 
can come alive. 
There are three things that you can create using Java: 
• 
applet 
• 
application 
• 
beans 
A Java applet is a program that can be embedded in an HTML 
document. Typically they are small programs which download quickly 
and perform a specific task. On the next page we will see how to use 
an applet which sends a message across the screen, similar to the 
<MARQUEE> tag that we saw earlier. However, this applet presents a 
message that is far more sophisticated than the HTML tag. 
A Java application is almost identical to a Java applet. It is a program, 
written in Java, the only difference is that it stands alone and does not 
require a browser to run it. 
Java beans are new. Each bean performs a very limited function, but 
they can be linked together or linked into Java applets and applica-
tions to extend their functions. 
You may be wondering why Java is becoming so popular. One of its 
very attractive features is that a Java program will run on any 
computer, provided they have a Java capable web browser. Unlike 
other programs which have to be compiled for the operating system 
on the computer where they will run. Therefore, once the program is 
written, it can run anywhere. Anyone who bought an Apple Mac 
computer will remember the days when some software was not 
available for that machine, but would be for Microsoft Windows. Now 
if Java had been available then, this would not have been a problem. 
Another nice aspect to Java programs is that they don't require an 
special installation procedure and if they are updated, then you 

automatically receive the latest version, the next time you run the 
program when you load it from their web site. 
It is impossible here to cover this subject in any depth, therefore it is 
highly recommended that if you want to learn more about this subject 
to refer to the books, Java Made Simple and Javascript Made Simple 
by P.K.McBride. 
Over the next few pages we will see how Java applets can be embedded 
in an HTML document and how we can use Javascript. 
This page from Citibank is using a Java applet in the bottom left corner 
to display current stock prices and you can even specify the stock 
prices it is to display. Applet like this, which take input from visitors, 
can be used to customise a page to their requirements.

Java applet 
Java applets appear on many web sites, performing a wide variety of 
tasks. There are many available, and non-programmer Web page 
designers would usually rather use an applet that has already been 
created. The following pages will concentrate on how to include an 
applet on our page. 
There are many Java applets available on the Internet and some 
places that have a good library include: 
• 
http://java.sun.com/applets/index.html 
• 
http://www.developer.com/directories/pages/dir.java.html 
• 
http://www.jars.com/

Using a Java applet 
1SO 
A Java applet is included using the <APPLET> tag. All applets usually 
require some parameters to control how they look and what they 
display and don't be surprised if you have to specify many parameters. 
The applet can be downloaded to your computer for testing, then 
stored with your other Web files on your ISP's computer. It can also 
be referenced from its home site on the Internet. When visitors arrive 
at a page containing an applet, its file will then be downloaded (from 
wherever it is held) to their comuter for running. 
In the example shown below, taken from the Wolf 359 web site, they 
use an external Java applet to display a message. When we look at the 
HTML source above, we can see a parameter that points to an external 
web site and other parameters that specify the message, speed and 
size.

Extract all of these files 
to your Web folder 
Java applet and 
-----r-i sample html files 
For each applet, all the required files are normally packaged into a zip 
file which contains the Java applet and some sample HTML which 
describes the applet and an example so that you can see it working. 
The first step is to unpack the zip file and store the Java applets in 
your web directory. Then take the sample HTML and modify the 
parameters to suit your requirements. 
All applets have a name and the applet is referenced using the CODE= 
clause inside the applet tag. You should not change the name because 
otherwise the browser won't be able to find the applet. Modify the 
parameters, following the style in the sample HTML, to suit your 
needs. In this example for SpaceWave we pass in parameters for the 
font, message, size and moving characteristics. 
When the applet definition is complete, the </APPLET> tag terminates 
it. Now we can include any other HTML such as headings, tables etc. 
The Java applet can be tested using your browser without connecting 
to the Internet. When you are satisfied with the applet, you can then 
include the HTML in the document where the applet is to be used. 
Don't forget to include your Java applets when you upload your HTML 
files to your Web site. 
When designing a page, always consider the time required to download 
and start the Java applet. Although they can have a stunning effect on 
a Web site, their value is nill is the reader will not wait for the applet 
to start. Another consideration is that not every browsers support 
Java so some readers will not be able to see your page.

Tip 
Don't forget to change the preferences on 
your browser to enable Java and Javascript. 
1S3 

Javascript 
1S4 
Netscape has developed Javascript, a scripting language that works 
within HTML. Javascript is included directly in your HTML document, 
using the <SCRIPT> tags. As the HTML is processed, the Javascript 
commands are interpreted and processed at the same time. However, 
in order to use Javascript, your visitor must be using a browser that 
supports it and has Javascript enabled. If you are not sure as to 
whether your browser supports Javascript then check in the 
Preferences section to see if it can be enabled/disabled. 
Javascript, although not as powerful as Java, is frequently included 
on Web sites, because it is very easy to learn. Another benefit is that 
a Web site can contain many files and it is very easy to lose some of 
them, or forget to upload them to your site. With Javascript, your 
instructions are included in your HTML document so they are easy to 
manage and you are not likely to mislay them. 
Javascript is becoming quite popular, for example, this page from 
British Airways makes extensive use of Javascript, including a scroll-
ing message to bring to your attention the latest news.

lf you have ever written a program before then you should have no 
problem using Javascript because it has most of the attributes of any 
programming language, such as the ability to define variables, display 
messages, trap error conditions and loop for a certain period of time. 
You can create your own functions which call Javascript functions, 
then to call any of these or the supplied functions, you call them, 
inside <SCRIPT> tags which are placed inside a <BODY> tag, as we can 
see in this example. 
simple Javascript 
<HTML> 
Create my own function called areyousure 
<SCRIPT> 
function areyousure ) 
{ confirm ("Are you sure you meant to do that?") } 
</SCRIPT> 
Use Javscript function confirm to display box 
<BODY> 
<SCRIPT> 
window.defaultStatus="Lilian's Page" 
Display message at bottom 
areyousure() 
</SCRIPT> 
</BODY> </HTML> 
Confirm box 
with my text 
Message: "Lilian's Page" 
Call my function areyousure 
1SS 

1S6 
Some of the other useful functions include on click for when you click 
a button, onMouseOver activates when mouse is dragged over this 
area and alert to create an message box. 
To output information use the write function which generates HTML 
to send to the browser. Therefore this function is unusual because 
you have to say to yourself, what HTML do I need to generate the 
required output. For example, suppose you want two blank lines and 
then the text you would enter 
document.write(" <BR> <BR> Text goes here") 
Programs usually need variables and in Javascript you can define 
numbers, strings, boolean values and null values. Remember that 
variables do not have to be static, they can be used in calculations and 
incremented or decremented in loops. 
Variables are given names and assigned a value using the equal sign. 
If the variable is of type text, then the text string is specified between 
quotes. When referencing variables you must refer to them exactly as 
they are defined using the appropriate upper or lowercase characters. 
Arrays may also be defined and then their contents displayed using 
for loops or other methods. An important point to remember with 
arrays is that the first position in the array is zero not 1 
If you have ever wondered how a web page can receive some data, 
perform calculations and then redisplay it. They are most probably 
using Javascript to do that. 
Javascri pt also contains a comprehensive set of commands to perform 
loops and perform conditional commands using if then else state-
ments. 
On these few pages we have just scratched the surface on what you 
can do in Javascript. A comprehensive list of Javascript functions and 
how to use them can be obtained from books like Javascript Made 
Simple by P.K.McBride or from the Netscape site at: 
home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/script/index.html

Summary 
1S8 
In this chapter we have learnt some techniques that will enable us to 
create very professional looking web sites. 
Rather than always using static data, we can also include sound and 
video files for the reader to download. Watching a preview clip of next 
weeks favourite TV episode is far more interesting than reading the 
synopsis. 
If Java applets are used on the web page then even more customisation 
and fancy effects are possible. We have seen how a bank can use a Java 
applet so that each visitor can request the stocks they are interested 
in to be displayed at the bottom of the web page. 
Using Javascript in your HTML document, you can interact with the 
visitor beyond what is possible in standard HTML. 
Some useful techniques to practise would be: 
D 
review from sound and video files, check their size and see 
how long they take to download; 
D 
review the libraries of Java applets that are available on the 
Internet and select some and see you can customise them for 
your web page; 
D 
investigate how you could modify your form document to 
use Javascript.

Installing your Web page 
160 
The time has now come to install your Web pages on the Internet. The 
steps involved will depend on whether the pages are being loaded 
onto a corporate Web site, or onto a service providers computer. This 
involves copying all the files that make up your Web page, i.e. the 
HTML source files, graphics, Java applets, sound and video files to the 
specified location. 
A corporate Web site will have specific directories where HTML 
documents are located. To include your files, you will have to discuss 
with the Web site administrator, how and when you can do this. 
Amendment to the corporate home page may also be required, which 
could delay the availability of your Web pages. 
If your Web pages are to be published via an Internet service provider, 
then they will advise the format and directories where your Web 
documents should be placed. The following text assumes that your 
files are to be published via a service provider. There are several ways 
that these files can be transferred: 
• 
Using the utility FTP; 
• 
Netscape Composer; 
• 
Internet Explorer. 
The FTP utility is perfect for copying files to the service provider's 
computer. When using this utility, you should to set the file type -
use ASCII for HTML text files, and binary for sound, graphics and video 
files. You can select one or many files to transfer. 
Once the primary HTML document is renamed to the format specified 
by your Internet provider, your pages will be visible on the Internet, 
e.g. at Claranet, the main HTML document must be called index.html.

Good housekeeping 
When constructing Web documents it is very important to adopt good 
housekeeping practices. A personal Web site, hosted by an Internet 
service provider will not backup your Web page, therefore it is up to 
you to make sure that they are safe. Good housekeeping means: 
• 
Keep all your Web files together in the same folder e.g. the 
author uses d:\ web_page. 
• 
Copy all the files to a floppy disk as a backup or use Microsoft 
Backup to make a copy of the files. 
• 
Always create a new backup floppy disk when you change your 
Web page. 
• 
Label the floppy disks with the date the Web page was 
constructed. 
• 
When you install the Web page on your Internet service 
provider's computer, always rename the files that you are 
about to replace, so that you have a local backup copy. Then 
install the new files. Fail to do so and if you make a mistake 
you could lose the original version of your Web site and have 
nothing to fall back to. 
• 
If your files are large, use a compression utility like PKZIP to 
store the files on your local disk. 
• 
Use the comment feature to specify a version of the file and 
the date that you last changed it.

Uploading with Internet Explorer 
Users of Internet Explorer 4, can publish their Web pages using the 
provided utility, Web Publishing wizard. Since this is a wizard, and it 
seems that all wizards must ask quite a lot of questions, you will find 
that there is far more work to do when using this tool. 
One point to bear in mind is that it will try to connect to your service 
provider and then prompt you for your username and password to 
logon, so be ready.

Once all of these questions have been answered, the wizard will 
connect to your service provider and upload all of the files. With an 
insight into how you can transfer files using Internet Explorer and 
Netscape, you may decide to use FTP which is in fact what these tools 
are doing behind the scenes. 
No matter which approach you use, you will not be able to upload any 
files unless you know the address and your username and password 
to logon. Of course, if you forget your username and password you 
cannot even connect to your service provider. But if the details are 
stored in an automatic connection it is easy to forget what they are! 
16S 

Opening your Web page 
166 
Once all of your files have been published on the Internet, it's time to 
see how the page looks to the whole world. 
A Web page is invoked by entering its address, also known as a URL. 
Today it is very common to see companies including their Web 
address on advertising material, such as http://www.oracle.com. As 
to what your own Internet address will be, you will have to ask your 
Internet provider or Web administrator, to advise on their naming 
scheme. e.g. the author's is http://home.clara.net/lmhobbs 
When you specify this address in your browser, one of several things could 
happen: 
• 
the page displays; 
• 
the page displays but the format is not what you required. Edit 
the page, upload it to the Internet and try again; 
• 
A URL error occurs, which means it cannot find your page. 
Some of these problems could be caused by the HTML documents or 
files being stored using filenames the wrong case, e.g. some computers 
would consider the files a.htm and A.HTM to be different. Another 
reason could be that the files have been stored using the wrong name 
or even stored in the wrong folder. 
If your home page doesn't appear then try to invoke another page by 
calling it directly, e.g. to invoke the page sas.html at the author's Web 
site you would specify 
http://home.clara.net/lmhobbs/sas.html 
Tip 
If the Web page fails to displav then check that all the files are 
correctly named. Especially look out for case differences. i.e. you 
tvped in uppercase when it should be in lowercase. 

This is the message 
displayed by 
Claranet if you

Once your pages are installed on your Web site, you can customise 
your browser so that every time it is launched or you click on the 
Home icon 
, your Web page is displayed automatically. The 
technique for customising will vary for each browser. 
It is not immediately obvious with Netscape where to find the home 
page information. You have to select Edit from the strip menu and 
then select Preferences. When the window is displayed the middle 
box should be the one where you can enter the address of your home 
page. If it isn't, then click on Navigator in the Category section. Then 
to make your Web page the default, enter its address into the location 
box in the Home Page section. If you can't remember the name of the 
file then click on the Browse button.

Tip 
Start by selecting Options from the View menu, then click on the 
Navigation tab. Take care here, because Internet Explorer allows you 
to specify the addresses of a number of pages. Therefore make sure 
that you have selected Start Page (Explorer's term for the home page) 
from the drop-down list for Page. Then enter the address of your 
home page into the address box. Click on the OK button and your 
browser preferences will be updated.

Telling the world 
Once your Web pages are installed, you will want to tell the world that 
they are there. Here are some reasons why you should announce your 
Web site: 
• 
for the benefit of friends or relatives who have lost touch and 
may be trying to find you; 
• 
you run a club and somebody needs some information; 
• 
to sell or promote your product; 
• 
your site includes information that may be of interest to 
people, say hobby related or pertains to a TV show; 
• 
for family tree researchers; 
There are several ways you can let people know about your site: 
• 
include your WWW address on all correspondence, such as 
letters and e-mail. 
• 
register your pages with search engines like Altavista, Yahoo 
and Infoseek, so your Web page is included in their database 
Trying to find information on the Internet is not always easy. People 
searching for information use Internet search engines which have 
databases of what is held on Web pages. They are updated regularly 
and there is no charge to include a reference to your Web site. 
AltaVista http:/ I www.altavista.com 
170 
Altavista is one of the most popular search engines and has grown to 
be one of the largest, with computers around the globe. If you visit the 
main site www.altavista.com, then you can find a local Alta Vista site 
and use that for improved performance. If you want the widest 
possible audience for your Web site, it pays to register with Altavista. 

~dding your URL 
At the main Altavista page, click on the Add/Remove URL option. You 
are then prompted to enter your URL, it's that simple. 
Click here to 
add your URL 
Tip 
Don't forget to 
remove URLs if 
vou change vour 
Web site.

Yahoo http://www.yahoo.com 
Another popular search engine is Yahoo. The approach that you have 
to use to register your site here is rather different. You have to select 
the category where your Web page belongs and then click on 'How to 
Suggest a Web Site'. Yahoo makes you fill in a number of screens 
before your entry is added to their database.

lnfoseek http://www.infoseek.com 
lnfoseek, like Altavista, makes it very easy for you to add your URL to 
their database. Just click on the Add URL option and you are presented 
with guidelines about how to register. Then you fill in the box with 
your URL entry and your site will be included in the database. What 
these search engines tend to do is look at the first part of your Web 
page and then use that as the description for your Web site. 
Another nice feature available at Infoseek is that you can check on the 
status of your submission. If you see that it has been processed, you 
can verify this by doing a search on lnfoseek using your details.

Meta 
174 
When a search engine is asked to register your Web page in its 
database, it searches your Web page for information to include. In the 
past, that has mean that important information could be overlooked 
and trivial information included. The solution to this problem is to 
use the <MET A> tag which tells the Internet search engine what is to 
be indexed. Other information can be specified inside the <META> 
tag, but we will concentrate on its indexing features. 
The <META> tag is defined within the <HEAD> tag and can be used in 
two ways to index our Web page. The first format is using the clauses 
Name= "keywords" and Content="". This is the one to use to tell the 
search engine which words it should index. 
The word keywords is placed inside the Name= clause to advise that 
keywords are being supplied. Then inside the Content= clause, write 
every keyword that is to be associated with this Web document. You 
may specify as many words or phrases as you like, each one is 
separated by a comma. 
Therefore, entries that could be specified for the author's Web page 
is the author's name, "Lilian Hobbs" and the word "author". 
<META NAME="keywords" CONTENT=" Lilian Hobbs, author"> 
Once the search engine has scanned this Web page, these two entries 
are put into its database. If you were to query using a search engine 
like Altavista, and you entered the word "author" as part of your 
search parameters, then this page should be returned in the list of 
matching entries. 
By using the <META> tag it allows you to reference your page many 
different ways. For example, if you view the source of the AA's Web 
page, one of their index entries is "Yellow Van". 
You may specify as many entries as you like for the content. If they will 
not all fit on one line, then start a new line, remembering to terminate 
the line with a comma as illustrated in the following example. 

<META NAME="keywords" 
CONTENT=" Lilian Hobbs, author, Oracle, Rdb, Home Page book, 
Bike book, Astronomy, Southampton Astronomical Society, 
Babylon 5" > 
When a search engine selects your page, it normally displays the first 
few lines of text that it finds on your Web page. Depending on the 
pages content, this may not convey much to the reader. This problem 
can be overcome by using the clause Name= "description", because it 
tells the search engine to display the text found within the content= 
clause, as shown below. 
<META NAME="description" 
CONTENT=" Lilian is the author of two Made Simple books" > 
Therefore, if you searched in Altavista using the name Lilian Hobbs, 
after your Web page URL it would display the following description. 
When a <META> tag is used on your Web page, it does not appear 
when the document is displayed, you can only see the values when 
you ask for the HTML source to be displayed. 
meta 
Text which will appear to 
hm•••lllr--------------, describe the Web page 
<HTML> 
<BODY> 
<META NAME="description" 
CONTENT="This book contains a guide to creating home pages" > 
<META NAME="keywords" 
CONTENT="HTML, Book, Made Simple, Internet, Tags, Lilian Hobbs"> 
~OD~ 
\ 
</HTML> 
Words entered in search engine 
that will make this page appear in 
the list of found entries

Space saving tips 
176 
Most Internet providers limit the amount of space you can use for a 
Web page, although this amount has been increasing over the years. 
The first service provider that the author used only allowed about 
lOOk. This wasn't very much and it was difficult to include any 
graphics. Now all that has changed and the author's current service 
provider Claranet, offers a staggering 25Mb of personal Web space. 
You may very well wonder how anyone could use up 25Mb, but it is 
very easy to consume it when you start storing graphics and espe-
cially video files. 
However you can you keep the space used to a minimum by following 
some of these approaches: 
• 
Use text rather than graphics; 
• 
Use small graphic files; 
• 
Use JPEG instead of GIF files; 
• 
Don't use too many graphic files; 
• 
Ensure graphic files are their smallest size. You can decrease 
the size by saving as fewer colours or making the image 
smaller; 
• 
Use graphics from a library provided by your Internet service 
provider; 
• 
Don't include movie files or limit their use; 
• 
Avoid using sound files or keep them small in size; 
• 
Remember to delete old files that are no longer required; 
• 
Point to files external to your Web site. However, when using 
this technique be aware of the time it will take to retrieve the 
file. You must also remember to respect other people's 
copyright. If you want to include someone else's images in 
your page, you must have their permission. 

Bringing it all together 
Now that we have seen many of the techniques that you can use to 
build a Web page. How do you create one of those nice-looking pages 
that you have seen? 
Many commercial sites are created and maintained by professional 
Web page designers, some of whom were graphic artists. To create 
some of the impressive graphics with different types of images then 
you will probably need access to professional graphic software such 
as that from Adobe. However, these tools are not essential and with 
tools like Paint Shop Pro you can create good quality images. 
All the examples in this book have been simple ones. All you need to 
do now is to combine these techniques together to create the desired 
effect. For instance, that could mean creating an image map for 
navigating the site, using frames to separate the navigation area from 
the text area, using a table to include your company logo with some 
text and creating the sites with multiple documents and plenty of links 
to other Web sites containing relevant information. 
A Web page is an evolving document and often it pays to start with 
something simple and then improve upon your design. Spend some 
time looking at other Web sites to gather ideas on presentation and 
content. Don't be afraid to try new techniques and experiment. 
Remember that you can work on the Web page without being connected 
to the Internet. Therefore you only have to publish it when you are 
ready. Alternatively, you could publish it, but not place it in a location 
where it is easily accessible and then ask people to review its content 
before moving your Web page to a public place. 
Finally, a Web page doesn't have to include fancy graphics. Simple 
text presented with a nice background and external links may not win 
you any awards, but it will be fast and informative. 
177 

Summary 
178 
In this final chapter we have seen how we can upload our documents 
to the Internet, which isn't very difficult and there are some tools 
around to make this job easier. 
Once our page is on the Internet, it is nice if people can find it and 
therefore its worth spending a little time registering your page with 
the main search engines and using the <META> tags to ensure that 
your page is indexed so that users can locate it. 
Finally, now that you have a Web page, do keep all the files that 
comprise your page, such as graphics, HTML and Java applets in a 
safe place. Your Internet provider will not back them up and you 
would be very disappointed if they were lost. 
Hopefully you will agree that creating a Web page is not that difficult 
and the HTML language is quite easy to learn.
