Introduction
A

t its near-permanent spot in the top-ten grossing apps in the entire Mac App 
Store, Logic Pro X has proven itself to be in high demand. You shouldn’t 
expect anything less than stellar software from Apple. And there’s a good 
reason why Logic Pro is professionally competitive. Apple designs intuitive 
software that music producers love and at the best possible value.
In line with Apple’s mission, I wrote Logic Pro X For Dummies to add value to 
your Mac and Logic Pro X. You learn how to record, arrange, edit, mix, and 
share your music, becoming a self-sufficient musician with your computer 
and Logic Pro. This book will guide you to make more music.
About This Book
If I could give people one superpower, I would give them instant musical 
talent. My world would be a curious musical, filled with willing musical part­
ners. Logic Pro X For Dummies is my honest attempt to make musical part­
ners out of every reader, including you.
This book is designed to get you making music fast. You don’t even need to 
know how to play an instrument to make music with Logic Pro because it 
comes with additional content that you can use in your projects. Regardless 
of your current capabilities, the step-by-step instruction in this book will get 
you making music fast.
I’m happy you came to me to learn Logic Pro X because I have been coaching 
Logic Pro users since 2007 and know the common frustrations and mistakes 
people make. I want you to feel confident using the software so you can com­
plete more projects and share your music — with others and with me. This 
book gives you the most important information you need to quickly meet 
your musical goals and turn your ideas into completed projects.
Logic Pro X For Dummies is organized for easy access. It’s your productivity 
advisor and your reference for quickly finding the information you need. And 
because many people learn more quickly by watching someone else, I pro­
vide free videos and project templates to accompany the book at http://
logicstudiotraining.com/lpxfordummies.
                           

2
Logic Pro X For Dummies 
Throughout the book, I use certain conventions to show you what to do. For 
example, when you choose items from menus, I use the command arrow, 
such as Choose File➪Edit. Links to websites are presented in a monospace 
font, such as http://logicstudiotraining.com. If you purchased the 
e-book, links are live and will take you directly to the web page. Finally, Logic 
Pro uses the term key command for any combination of keys that can act as a 
shortcut to a function; when I refer to the Command key, I use the ⌘ symbol.
Foolish Assumptions
As I said, I want to give you instant talent, but I have to make some assump­
tions about you, my friendly reader. I’m pretty sure you have the music bug. 
But it’s possible that you want to only record audio with Logic Pro X, such as 
voice-overs or live seminars. This book covers those topics, but I’m also writ­
ing for the musician in you.
I believe that you bought this book not only to learn how to use software but 
also to create music. Logic Pro is the tool and your music is the reason the 
tool exists.
I also assume that you’re not making as much music as you could be making. 
I know I’m not. I’m sure we could all be bringing more music into the world, 
and I often aggressively push for it. I love to train musicians because they 
are great listeners. Great listeners make great leaders, and if I didn’t push for 
more great leaders, I would feel that I wasted a golden opportunity to inspire 
you to greatness. The more music you make, the better listener you become.
Even if you’re a beginner, I assume you’ll be able to make music that sounds 
great with Logic Pro X. It might be a foolish assumption, but given everything 
Logic Pro X can do for you, I really don’t think so. Finally, I make the safe 
assumption that you’ll enjoy your time with Logic Pro X.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see helpful icons throughout this book. Scan for them and you’ll find 
useful information that will help pull everything together and even broaden 
your perspective. Readers love to scan and I love to write for scanners.
	
The Tip icon is usually designed to give you an “aha” moment. Tips go beyond 
step-by-step instruction into strategies and techniques to make better sound­
ing music. Pay close attention to the tips!
                           

3
 Introduction 
	
The Remember icon points out information that you need to keep in mind as 
you use Logic Pro. In some cases, you’ll be given key commands that are 
important to remember. Other times, you’ll see a short refresher on informa­
tion that’s relevant to the topic and covered elsewhere in the book. Whenever 
you see this icon, it’s important to at least store the information in your short-
term memory. After all, the book remembers everything for you in the 
long term.
	
The Technical Stuff icon points out information that can be either skipped or 
treated as extra credit. The information in these sections shouldn’t be beyond 
your understanding, but you don’t need to know how the engine works to 
drive a car.
	
The Warning icon is reserved for potential mistakes that could cause you to 
sound bad. That’s the last thing I want, and fortunately, sounding bad is hard 
to achieve with Logic Pro X. So when you see the Warning icon, please read it!
Beyond the Book
As mentioned, I deliver content outside this book in the form of videos and 
project files. Where appropriate, I’ve added a link to a web page with further 
instructions. These videos should help you visualize the content of the book, 
and the project files are excellent resources for starting out.
In addition, For Dummies books include one of my favorite tools of all time, 
the cheat sheet. I make cheat sheets for a hobby, and I’m excited to give you 
what I’ve got at www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/logicprox.
You also have access to Dummies.com online articles that expand the book 
even further. You’ll find these articles on the book’s Extras page at www.
dummies.com/extras/logicprox. And if the book has any technical 
updates, they’ll be posted there as well.
Where to Go from Here
Although I wrote the book to be somewhat linear and to follow a logical pro­
gression, you can start anywhere you want. Because I reference chapters 
throughout the book, you should be able to open any chapter and follow 
along.

Logic Pro X For Dummies 
If you’re new to Logic Pro, you’ll at least want to skim the first four chapters. 
These chapters make up Part I and will get you started using Logic Pro and 
understanding how it works. Part II shows you how to record audio, load 
and play software instruments, and add prerecorded media to your project. 
If you’re upgrading from previous versions of Logic Pro, you might skip to 
Part III and learn about the new software instruments or head over to Part IV 
where you learn how to use the exciting new editing features such as flex 
pitch.
Part V is dedicated to mixing audio so that the final result sounds good and is 
ready to share with the world. From the beginning of the book to the end, you 
have a powerful music production blueprint. I hope you get what you need.

T

he joke used to be that Logic Pro wasn’t logical. I would argue that it was 
logical but not intuitive. Nowadays, you can’t make that joke without 
dating yourself because Apple, which is known for making the complicated 
simple, bought Logic Pro from Emagic in 2002. The product just keeps getting 
better and better.
You’ll find that creating music with Logic Pro can be a straightforward and 
rewarding experience. One caveat: As you explore Logic Pro, remember your 
desired outcome. With so many bright and shiny objects in this deep and 
powerful app, getting distracted is easy. But if you keep your musical and 
learning goals in mind, you’ll discover why Logic Pro is responsible for so 
many Billboard hits.
Take command. Logic Pro listens.
In this chapter, you discover why Logic Pro users are proud, productive, and 
ready to play. You’ll understand how to plan your creations, get the most 
value from your time with Logic Pro, set up your studio, and much more.

Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
Embracing Logic Pro
Lots of digital audio workstations (DAWs) are out there, so why would you 
want to settle down with Logic Pro? Here’s a list of reasons why you don’t 
need to look any further than Logic Pro:
	
✓	Logic Pro is designed by Apple, so hardware and software compatibility 
are simple and usually hassle-free. I have upgraded Logic Pro and the 
Mac operating system within a week of new releases and have yet to 
encounter any problems. If you’re ever wondering whether it’s safe to 
upgrade, stop by http://logicstudiotraining.com and ask me.
	
✓	Logic Pro has thousands of sampled instruments and effects presets, so 
you can save thousands of dollars in additional expenses. You get a com­
plete studio — including a virtual drummer who won’t show up late or 
scuff your floors.
	
✓	Logic Pro excels at both recording and editing audio and MIDI. Some 
DAWs do one or the other really well, but Logic Pro does both with 
superb sound quality and ease of use.
	
✓	Logic Pro is compatible with most audio and MIDI hardware. I rarely 
get asked hardware questions from my clients because the product just 
works.
Remembering the Logic Pro journey
Logic Pro has come a long way since its incep­
tion. In the mid-80s, the German company 
C-LAB created Supertrack for the Commodore 
64 computer. This product evolved into the 
Creator software program and eventually 
became Notator Logic, which ran on the Atari 
system in the early 90s. Here are some impor­
tant milestones on the path to Logic Pro X:
	✓	1994: Audio recording capabilities were 
added to Notator Logic.
	✓	2000: Virtual instruments were added to 
Logic 4.
	✓	2002: Apple purchased Logic.
	✓	2004: Logic 6 became Mac-only.
	✓	2007: Several audio applications, including 
Logic Pro 8 and MainStage, were bundled 
as Logic Studio. New features such as Quick 
Swipe Comping and the Delay Designer 
plug-in were introduced, and the copy pro­
tection USB dongle was eliminated.
	✓	2009: Logic Pro 9 introduces more features 
such as flex time editing, Amp Designer, 
and Pedalboard plug-ins.
	✓	2010: Logic Pro 9 goes 64-bit.
	✓	2013: Logic Pro X is released, with a rede­
signed look, flex pitch editing, new editors, 
the Drummer software instrument, the 
Bass Amp Designer plug-in, virtual vintage 
instruments, MIDI plug-ins, track stacks, 
smart controls, tighter integration with 
GarageBand, the Logic Remote iPad app, 
and much more.

 Chapter 1: Getting Logic Pro Up and Sprinting
	
✓	Logic Pro enables you to provide professional notation for lead sheets 
and full scores. When you need to hand out chord charts to the band or 
provide fully engraved charts with advanced markup to the orchestra, 
Logic Pro has you covered. Logic Pro can also create guitar tablature 
and add lyrics to your score.
	
✓	Logic Pro supports many hardware control surfaces, so you can control 
knobs, faders, buttons, and other parameters in Logic Pro right from 
your hardware. An inexpensive MIDI controller can be turned into a 
remote control for advanced control (or when the hand you use for your 
mouse or trackpad begins to ache from overuse).
	
✓	Logic Pro is a powerful mixing console. If your computer can handle 
it, you can have 255 audio tracks, 255 software instrument tracks, and 
255 auxiliary tracks. You weren’t worried about running out of tracks, 
were you? And because you don’t have 255 hands, you can automate 
parameter changes on all those tracks.
	
✓	Logic Pro is a 64-bit application that gives you increased power. Older 
32-bit apps allow the use of only 4MB of RAM, but Logic Pro can access 
all the memory your computer has installed. You can run more plug-ins 
and more software instruments without a hiccup.
I’ve only touched the surface of what Logic Pro can do. Surround sound, vir­
tual vintage instruments, drum machines, guitar amps and pedals, pitch and 
time editing, and MIDI effects are a fraction of what you have available as a 
Logic Pro user. Congratulations on making such a smart choice to embrace 
Logic Pro. Welcome to the club!
Transitioning from Other Software
I won’t bad-mouth or slam other DAWs. It’s a good rule to live by, especially 
when you collaborate with musicians who use different software. I happen to 
be a fan of GarageBand and use it regularly because it integrates so well with 
Logic Pro. If you’ve used GarageBand, you’ll find the Logic Pro interface famil­
iar and welcoming.
Logic Pro X has many of the same features as GarageBand, plus a lot more, 
such as a professional mixer and finer control over audio and MIDI regions. 
GarageBand 10 users are familiar with smart controls, but with Logic Pro X 
you can do a lot more with them, such as control and edit more parameters. 
Best of all, Logic Pro can open GarageBand projects, including GarageBand 
projects created in iOS, the operating system that powers the iPhone, the

Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
iPad, and the iPod touch. Being able to start projects on one of those devices 
and continue working on them in GarageBand or Logic Pro creates a powerful 
workflow.
If you’re coming from another software environment, maintain a beginner’s 
mind as you explore Logic Pro. The workflow is probably similar to what 
you’re accustomed to. It won’t take you long to understand that a Logic Pro 
project has tracks containing MIDI or audio regions and that you can arrange 
those regions right in the main window or edit them in the various editors. 
Did I just give the whole book away right there? Not quite, but understanding 
Logic Pro is almost that simple.
Just remember, if your objective is clear, Logic Pro can help you reach it.
Creating with Logic Pro	
With Logic Pro, you have a full band at your fingertips. From country to 
dance music, songwriting to film scoring, capturing MIDI performances to 
professional audio recording, Logic Pro will excite your passions and show­
case your strengths. Lead the way and Logic Pro will follow.
Thinking like a pro
Whether or not you’re in it for the money, having a professional mindset can 
make your experience with Logic Pro more productive and enjoyable.
My advice to new and seasoned Logic Pro users alike is to set a goal and 
work steadily towards that goal. Here’s what I’ve found and I hope you agree. 
Creativity loves speed. Slow and tedious labor kills creativity faster than any­
thing. So set a clear objective and move quickly towards completion.
Planning your creative process
You can always wait for inspiration to strike you — but you could end up 
waiting a long time. And when inspiration does strike, it often doesn’t stick 
around long. For all the moments when you’re not feeling inspired, having a 
plan for your creative process can help.
What’s your purpose for the project? Are you learning something or creating 
something? If you’re learning, what’s your learning goal and how much time 
are you going to give it? You could easily get lost trying to learn everything 
                           

11
 Chapter 1: Getting Logic Pro Up and Sprinting
Logic Pro can do and never create anything. That will suck the joy out of 
using Logic Pro, and you’ll find yourself opening it less and less. So give 
yourself learning limits and give yourself creative projects. Connecting to the 
purpose of your project will keep you motivated and moving in a clear and 
forward direction.
Here are some example projects to get you learning and creating:
	
✓	Learn a tool. Logic Pro comes with lots of tools and editors to help you 
achieve your creative goals. Spend 5 to 15 minutes learning a single tool, 
function, or editor. You will have many opportunities to do this through­
out the book.
	
✓	Write a song. Lots of my students find it easier to separate writing a 
song from recording a song. Writing a song means starting from scratch 
and trying out ideas. You’ll end up doing some recording, but your pur­
pose is not to create “keeper” tracks but to experiment and organize 
your ideas.
	
✓	Record a song. If you’ve already written a song, record it. Logic Pro 
has an intuitive interface, and you’ll be able to polish your tracks until 
they’re as shiny as a platinum record.
	
✓	Sequence an 8-bar loop. Not all projects have to be big and grand. 
A simple 8-bar piece of music can become a loop that you can use in 
another project or license to another artist.
	
✓	Compose a score. Use the orchestral instruments or synthesizers to 
create a score for a video or just for fun. If you have any home videos 
on your computer, you can import them to Logic Pro and give them a 
soundtrack. Play the video at the next holiday reunion, and your film 
composition is sure to impress friends and family.
	
✓	Design a sound. Spend 30 minutes with any of the Logic Pro virtual 
instruments and come up with your own sounds. Several synths even 
come with a randomize button to keep the sound fresh. Ever wondered 
what a six-foot guitar made of cardboard would sound like? Me neither, 
but you can make it happen with the Sculpture software instrument in 
Logic Pro.
	
✓	Mix a song. You can use a project you’ve recorded or you can use 
Apple loops to practice your mixing chops and share your ­project 
with the world. Be sure to consult my mixing guide at http://logic
studiotraining.com to make your time in audio engineering land 
productive and free of earaches.
These examples are just a sampling of the types of projects you can start. 
The main point is to set a clear objective so you can achieve your goal. Set 
yourself up to win and you’ll stay motivated.

Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
Getting to the finish line
Most Logic Pro users come to me for help not with getting started but with 
getting things done. When inspiration fades, so does motivation, unless you 
have a strategy for getting to the finish line.
Here are some tips for completing projects:
	
✓	Set time limits. Give yourself the shortest time frame for completing a 
task. Parkinson’s law states that work expands to fill the time available 
to complete it. Set aside 10 hours to complete a job, and it will take 
10 hours. Set aside 30 minutes, and the job will take 30 minutes. For 
larger projects, put a deadline on the calendar and stick to it. This sug­
gestion might sound rigid, but the only thing you have to lose is your 
uncompleted projects.
	
✓	Make projects attainable. Dream big but be realistic. If you’ve never 
done a particular task before, give yourself time to learn and improve. 
You might want to write a chart-buster, but begin by writing a simple 
song with a clear structure. Then you can build upon your new skills and 
improve with each project.
	
✓	Break the project down. Typically, an album is made up of many songs, 
each song is made up of many instruments recorded on separate tracks, 
and each track is made up of many takes that are edited and turned into 
a final take. When you list all the tasks required to complete your proj­
ect, you’ll have an easier time completing each task.
	
✓	Keep it simple. The fewer parts you commit to your project, the easier 
it will be to complete. Many pop songs have 32 tracks on the low end 
and more than 100 tracks on the not-so-high end, but that doesn’t mean 
you have to do the same. Lots of great songs have only four instruments, 
including the lead vocal. Try to simplify your project; you’ll find that 
completing your project is much easier when it isn’t complicated.
The more you create, the better you’ll get. The more projects you com­
plete, the more confidence you’ll have. With confidence and chops, you’ll 
tackle more ambitious projects and find yourself working with higher-level 
musicians.
Now that you’ve read about the Logic Pro producer’s mindset, it’s time to get 
your gear ready to handle your mad genius.

 Chapter 1: Getting Logic Pro Up and Sprinting
Connecting Your Logic Pro Studio	
You can do a lot just with the Logic Pro software. You can play the software 
instruments with your computer keyboard by using musical typing (described 
in Chapter 7). You can import media from a variety of sources, such as iTunes 
or iMovie (as detailed in Chapter 8). You can use headphones or your com­
puter speakers to listen to your project. To take advantage of all that Logic 
Pro has to offer, however, you’ll want to connect some peripheral devices.
Consider adding some or all of the following devices to your studio:
	
✓	Audio interface: You’ll need to get audio into and out of your computer. 
Your computer probably has a built-in mic, but you might also want to 
capture audio from a variety of sources such as a keyboard, guitar, and 
microphone. You may want to be able to record more than one instru­
ment at a time. Audio interfaces allow you to get professional sounding 
audio into your Logic Pro project. You can get inexpensive, good quality 
input devices through major retailers such as Amazon and the Apple 
store, or you can search eBay and Craigslist for used options. USB and 
Thunderbolt connectivity are standard on the latest Apple computers. 
Firewire might be another option, depending on the capabilities and age 
of your computer.
	
✓	Speakers: In the pro audio community, your speakers are known as mon­
itors. In a pinch, your computer speakers will do just fine. I use them to 
do a chunk of my mixing because many people listen to music on their 
laptop’s speakers. (The same advice goes for Apple’s earbuds, which are 
provided with all their mobile devices.) For a more accurate picture of 
your audio, listen to your project on a set of monitors that produces the 
entire frequency range. There’s a good chance that the audio interface 
you choose will have a stereo monitor output for connecting a pair of 
speakers.
	
✓	MIDI controller: MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) allows 
devices to talk to each other and enables you to control all the wonder­
ful software instruments that come with Logic Pro. A MIDI controller 
can be a keyboard, drum pads, or any other device that transmits MIDI. 
MIDI controllers connect to your computer by USB or by a separate MIDI 
interface for devices that have 5-pin DIN connectors.
	
✓	iPad: The Logic Remote iPad app can control software instruments and 
the mixer, execute key commands, and more. Best of all, the app is free! 
It connects to Logic Pro through your Wi-Fi network. Got a keyboard sit­
ting 20 feet across the room? No problem: Use the iPad to control Logic 
Pro remotely. I cover Logic Remote in Chapter 20.

Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
Setting up your computer
If you haven’t already installed Logic Pro X on you computer, get it from the 
Apple App Store. Open the App Store in your Applications folder and search for 
Logic Pro X. Purchase and install it (an installation wizard will guide you) — but 
be patient while downloading because the program is about 800MB. You need 
a minimum of 5GB of disk space plus 35GB if you want to add optional content 
available through a free in-app download. You also need a minimum of 4GB of 
RAM, a display with 1280-by-768 resolution or higher, and OS X v10.8.4 or later.
To download the additional Logic Pro X content, launch Logic Pro X. Choose 
Logic Pro X➪Download Additional Content. Select all the additional content 
packages you want to install, and then click the Install button.
	
I recommend finding the hard drive space to download the additional content 
because the instruments, samples, and loops you get are fantastic and fun 
to play.
Here are some tips to make your experience with Logic Pro X as smooth as 
possible:
	
✓	Pay attention to Time Machine backups. If you use Time Machine to 
back up your computer, Time Machine might access the hard drive while 
you’re accessing the hard drive with Logic Pro. As a result, you might 
get an error if you’re working on a project with a high track count or lots 
of samples streamed from the disk. Turn off Time Machine temporarily if 
you encounter any issues.
	
✓	Shut down other apps if you run out of power or if Logic Pro gets 
glitchy. When I arrange or edit my projects, I often leave other apps 
open. When I’m recording or in the final process of mixing, however, 
I close all other apps so that the hard drive is free and extra power is 
available for processor-intensive Logic Pro effects.
	
✓	Prevent app nap in OS X Mavericks. When apps are hidden and not 
actively working, they enter app nap to save power and battery life. This 
feature might get in the way if you put Logic Pro in the background while 
you, say, look at lyrics in a text document while recording your voice. To 
prevent Logic Pro “napping,” go to the Applications folder, right-click or 
Ctrl-click the Logic Pro X application, and choose Get Info. Then select 
the Prevent App Nap check box.
	
✓	Show Advanced Tools. Logic Pro X has with several advanced features 
that aren’t available by default. You should enable them so that you can 
follow along with the examples in this book. In the main menu, choose 
Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Advanced Tools and then select the Show 
Advanced Tools check box, as shown in Figure 1-1.

Now that you’ve installed Logic Pro X and made a few tweaks, you’re ready to 
connect your hardware and start making music.
Connecting your hardware
If you plan on recording audio, you’ll need a way to get audio into Logic Pro. 
Your Mac probably has a built-in line in or microphone. These may work in 
a pinch, but professional-quality recordings need professional hardware. 
Luckily, most professional hardware is compatible with Logic Pro X, so you 
should have a simple plug-and-play experience.
After you connect your audio hardware, you tell Logic Pro how to use it by 
choosing Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Audio. Select the Devices tab, as shown 
in Figure 1-2, and use the Output Device and Input Device drop-down menus 
to choose your audio hardware.
	
You can get to Logic Pro X Preferences quickly by pressing ⌘+comma (,). This 
key command will display the Preferences in most applications on your Mac.

Similarly, if you plan to control Logic Pro from a MIDI controller, your com­
puter needs to be connected to the controller. Many controllers will send and 
receive MIDI through USB, eliminating the need for a third-party interface. 
Other controllers may use 5-pin DIN cables and require a hardware MIDI 
interface to go between the computer and the controller. Check the literature; 
Logic Pro will probably be mentioned.
After you’ve connected your MIDI controller, Logic Pro will automatically 
listen for your controller’s signals on the currently selected track. Playing 
software instruments with a MIDI keyboard controller is usually a plug-and-
play experience without any need for customization.
With all your hardware connected, Logic Pro X is ready and waiting for your 
commands.
Building common setups
To help you visualize what a complete hardware and software setup looks 
like, I’ve designed some possible systems. You can create music with a com­
puter and the Logic Pro software alone. However, if your goals are more ambi­
tious and you want to get good sounds into and out of Logic Pro, consider

 Chapter 1: Getting Logic Pro Up and Sprinting
your hardware and the acoustics of your listening environment. Idealized sce­
narios aren’t necessary for good quality or enjoyment. With a Mac computer 
and Logic Pro X, your baseline for quality and fun is already high.
It’s easy to believe that you need the best equipment (and a lot of it) to create 
anything worthy of attention. Don’t believe the hype and don’t get GAS (gear 
acquisition syndrome). Spend your money wisely and spend your time creat­
ing, not buying. The setups in this section can be built inexpensively.
In a recording setup, such as the one shown in Figure 1-3, you need to get 
audio from instruments or microphones into Logic Pro. You also need to hear 
what you’re recording through monitors or headphones. Your audio interface 
is the intermediary between your computer and the peripherals.
	
Figure 1-3: 
A typical 
recording 
setup.
	
In a MIDI studio, such as the one in Figure 1-4, instruments such as synthesiz­
ers, drum machines, samplers, and even alternate controllers (for example, 
a guitar MIDI system) connect to a MIDI interface, which transmits the MIDI 
messages from the various instruments to the computer. An audio interface is 
still needed to transmit audio in and out of your system.
Figure 1-4: 
A studio 
of MIDI 
instruments.
If all you do is mix other people’s music, you may never need to do any 
recording of your own. In this case, you need an audio interface to get audio 
from Logic Pro and into a pair of monitors, as shown in Figure 1-5. You may, 
however, use a controller to mimic a mixing console with faders, knobs, but­
tons, and other useful features that control Logic Pro remotely.

I love to travel, and I never go anywhere without a laptop and an instrument. 
I travel with guitars, drum machines, small keyboards, and sometimes more 
than one of each. I like to keep the setup as simple as possible while afford­
ing me the flexibility that I love. In a mobile rig, such as the one shown in 
Figure 1-6, headphones will replace speakers, and portable interfaces and 
microphones will be used to get audio in and out of Logic Pro.
Figure 1-6: 
A mobile 
audio rig.
	
If you plan on performing live, consider buying MainStage, the companion app 
to Logic Pro. MainStage shares all the instruments and presets with Logic Pro 
but is designed for live performance. It has a gorgeous full-screen interface 
that’s easy to read on stage. MainStage doesn’t include features that you don’t 
need live, such as notation or audio and MIDI editors.
There’s never been a better time to be a Logic Pro user. You get an amazing 
studio at an amazing price and you can do amazing things with it. I hope 
you’re as excited as I am to dig into what Logic Pro can do.

▶	Discovering some timesaving workflow tips
▶	Backing up and securing your projects
▶	Sharing your projects for collaboration
L

ogic Pro projects are similar to any computer file types, except they’re 
larger in scope than files such as text documents. You might be shocked 
to see an entire chapter about a file type, but there’s so much more you can 
do with Logic Pro projects than you can with other file types that you’ll soon 
understand how important they are to the creative process.
Projects are flexible. When disk space is a concern, for example, you can 
save only the assets you want to keep. You can create project templates to 
speed up your workflow and set up Logic Pro exactly how you want to work. 
Each project contains global settings of the entire project as well as different 
snapshots of the project, such as different arrangements, mixes, or treat­
ments. For example, you can create an alternate version of your project if the 
producer calls for a version without a vocal (for when the performer needs to 
sing live on TV to a backing track).
In this chapter, I cover naming conventions to keep all your projects orga­
nized, tips and tricks to speed up your workflow, strategies for archiving and 
backing up your work, and much more.
Starting Your Project
A project is the file type that you work with in Logic Pro. The file extension of 
a Logic Pro project is .logicx. The project file contains MIDI events, parameter 
settings, and information about the audio and video in your project.
To get the big picture of your project and how it relates to Logic Pro, the hier­
archy goes like this:
Project➪Tracks➪Regions➪Events
                           

20
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
Your project contains tracks. Your tracks contain regions. Your regions con­
tain events. The File menu is where you do most of your project-level work.
To start an empty default Logic Pro project, choose File➪New or press 
Shift+⌘+N. A New Tracks dialog window opens, as shown in Figure 2-1. At the 
top of the screen, choose the type of track you would like to begin working 
with and then click Create.
	
Figure 2-1: 
The New 
Tracks 
dialog is 
where you 
choose your 
first track.
	
A more advanced and customized way to start a new project is to choose 
File➪New from Template (⌘+N). The Project Chooser window opens, as 
shown in Figure 2-2. You can select a premade project template, a recent 
project, or your own customized project template. I show you how to create 
a customized orchestral template in Chapter 12. Click Details (on the left) to 
display even more options for your new project, such as the tempo, time and 
key signatures, and audio input and output.
	
You can change any project option, but you should stick to a single sample 
rate. The default sample rate, 44.1 kHz, is used for CD quality audio and is the 
choice I recommend to all beginners. The 48 kHz sample rate is often used in 
video projects. Using higher sample rates depends on your hardware capabili­
ties and project needs.
After you start your project, you’re ready to begin recording, arranging, edit­
ing, and mixing. It’s a dream come true.
	
Choose a custom startup action to tell Logic Pro what to do when you launch 
it. If you’re the prolific type, you can create a new project every time you 
launch the app. If you, like me, are a mere mortal, you might want to open the 
most recent project on startup. Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪General 
and select the Project Handling tab, as shown in Figure 2-3. Then select your 
startup action. Logic Pro is kind enough to ask you what to do when it starts. 
But it won’t take food and drink orders. I’ve tried.

Opening a project
You can open a project in several ways. You can click a project file in Finder, 
which will launch Logic Pro and open the project. If another project is open, 
Logic Pro will ask if you want to close the project. More than one project can 
be open simultaneously, so it’s not necessary to close the current project. To 
switch between open projects, choose Window on the main menu and then 
select the project in the list at the bottom of the menu.
                           

22
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
You can open a project also from the File menu. Choose File➪Open or press 
⌘+O and a dialog will open allowing you to navigate to the location of your 
project in Finder. Choose File➪Open Recent instead to see a list of your 
recent projects.
Logic Pro can also open MIDI files, AAF files (Advanced Authoring Format 
files used by digital audio workstations such as Pro Tools), XML files (used 
by Final Cut Pro X), and GarageBand projects. It can also open projects cre­
ated with earlier versions of Logic Pro.
	
If this is your first time launching Logic Pro X, you can open a demo project 
from the Help menu. Choose Help➪Logic Pro Demo Project and a project by a 
chart-topping band will give you something to explore.
Saving a project
When you create your project, it is autosaved in the Logic folder under the 
temporary name Untitled.logicx. (You can get to the Logic folder in Finder by 
navigating to Users➪USERNAME➪Music➪Logic.)
To save your project manually, choose File➪Save. In the Save dialog that 
appears, name your project and choose a location or keep the default loca­
tion, which is the Logic folder. You can choose to organize your project 
as a package or a folder. A package saves your project as a single file that 
includes all project assets. A folder saves the project file and saves its assets 
in subfolders.
You can also choose to copy specific file types into your project. It’s a good 
idea to copy your audio files into the project, but you might not want to copy 
samples due to their potentially large file size. The benefit to saving a project 
without assets is that you conserve hard drive space. The downside is that 
it can be easy to mistakenly delete assets the project depends on. Hard drive 
space is inexpensive, so it makes sense to include all assets in your project 
folder. By doing so, organizing, moving, and archiving projects will be easier.
	
I find saving projects as packages is the simplest approach. You can view 
the contents of packages (all package file types, including Pages, Keynote, 
and Numbers files) by Ctrl-clicking the package in Finder and choosing Show 
Package Contents. All your audio files and assets will be in the Finder window 
that opens.
If you want to save the project with a different name or in a different location, 
choose Save As on the File menu. If you want to create a copy of the project, 
choose Save a Copy As on the File menu.
                           

23
 Chapter 2: Examining Logic Pro Projects
Closing a project
When you’re ready to close your project, choose File➪Close Project. If you’ve 
made any changes since you last saved your project, Logic Pro asks if you 
want to save the project. If you don’t want to keep those changes, select 
Don’t Save from the Save dialog.
Don’t confuse the Close Project command with the Close command. Both are 
on the File menu. The Close command simply closes the currently focused 
window. However, if your project has only one window open, which is often 
the case, using the Close command will also close your current project.
Naming and renaming a project
It’s a good idea to have a naming convention and stick with it. When I’m 
saving a project that doesn’t yet have a title, my file-naming convention is 
to use the date, key signature, harmonic mode, and tempo, followed by any 
other useful descriptors such as the musical genre, song section, and version 
numbers. For example:
2014-01-01 C Mixolydian 120bpm funk verse 1
Naming your file this way enables you to match projects based on mode 
and tempo. If you eventually come up with a title for your project, use 
the Save As command (described earlier) or just rename the project file 
in Finder. Or you can use the Rename function by choosing File➪Project 
Management➪Rename.
Augmenting Your Project
Projects are so basic to your workflow that you may take them for granted 
after a while. But you can do several cool things at the project level that will 
make your time with Logic Pro more productive.
Saving time with project templates
When you create a project (see earlier in this chapter), you see Project 
Chooser, where you can begin a project from a premade template. These 
default templates are excellent starting places. You can also create your own 
project templates.
                           

24
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
How can you save time with templates? If you’re recording several songs 
with a band and each song has a similar setup or you’re a film composer and 
use the same orchestra setups for all your scores, you could create a project 
template once and use it over and over again. (You find out how to create an 
orchestral template in Chapter 12.)
To save a template, set up your project how you want it and then choose 
File➪Save as Template. Project templates are saved in a special folder located 
at Users➪USERNAME➪Music➪Audio Music Apps➪Project Templates.
I love using templates and I’ve saved dozens of them. I have genre-based tem­
plates, templates that include my favorite third-party software, and templates 
that I’ve created from analyzing popular hits (and not-so-popular guilty plea­
sures). Templates are excellent productivity tools.
Autosave your hard work
When I was in high school, I spent an entire evening sequencing a popular 
song in one of the first Apple MIDI sequencers. I spent hours hunched over a 
computer keyboard instead of doing my homework, completely focused, with 
no bathroom breaks, until the electricity went out. I hadn’t saved the project 
even once.
Even though I was crushed, I jumped back in, and sequencing was much 
easier the second time around. I also developed a habit of pressing ⌘+S that 
I still have to this day. You might even find my left hand “air-saving” while I’m 
away from the computer. It’s a habit I’m happy to have.
Fortunately for you, Logic Pro X autosaves your work. If Logic Pro should crash, 
when you reopen the project, it will ask you to choose an autosaved version or 
the last manually saved version. However, even though the program autosaves, 
get in the habit of saving your work after every important change you make.
Recover from problems 
with project backups
What would you do if your computer was stolen or ruined? Barring the finan­
cial considerations of buying a new computer, could you recover quickly? If I 
were to lend you my own computer, could you rebound and save the game? If 
you couldn’t, please pay attention, for the sake of your music.
I’m a backup fanatic. I back up all my computers using Apple Time Capsule, 
built-in Time Machine software, and a few rotating external drives. I also 
back up my entire computer offline using Amazon S3 cloud storage. But wait, 
there’s more. I sync my current projects using Dropbox so I can work on 
them at multiple computers.
                           

25
 Chapter 2: Examining Logic Pro Projects
Logic Pro X also creates project backups every time you save your project. As 
long as you have Show Advanced Tools selected in the Advanced Preferences 
pane (see Chapter 1), you can revert to an earlier saved version of your 
project. Every time you save your project, a backup is made. You can revert 
to these backups by choosing File➪Revert To. A list of your time-stamped 
project backups allows you to go back in time to a previously saved project. 
This feature saves you when you try things out that you don’t like or make 
mistakes while working.
Create options with project alternatives
You can create alternative projects within a project. This feature saves you 
from creating new projects or copies of projects every time you want to try 
something new. The downside of creating copies of projects is that if you 
don’t do it properly and you delete audio from one project that’s being used 
in another project, you might lose that file in the first project. If everything is 
self-contained, you can try things out until your mad genius is content. Also, 
if you create two projects and want to A/B them, switching back and forth 
means all the plug-ins have to be reloaded each time, which can take enough 
time that your ear can’t tell the difference between the two.
To create a project alternative, choose File➪Alternatives➪New Alternative. You 
can rename and remove the alternatives by choosing File➪Alternatives➪Edit 
Alternative. As shown in Figure 2-4, each project alternative is time-stamped, 
which helps you know which project is the most recent and which is the original.
	
Figure 2-4: 
Rename 
and remove 
project 
alternatives.
	
Following are some examples of project alternatives you might want to try:
	
✓	Arrangements: Create project alternatives with different lengths for 
advertising, such as 10, 15, 30, and 60 seconds. Create an alternative 
with a short intro geared towards music industry professionals. Or 
try different instrumentations. Or if your band has a prima donna who 
needs to be louder than everyone else, let that band member hear 
                           

26
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
the louder version while the rest of the band hears the version you so 
expertly crafted. Or perhaps you want to hear how the project would 
sound with a song section in a different place.
	
✓	Singers: A secret in the song-pitching business is that female listeners 
often prefer to hear a male singer on a demo. With project alternatives, you 
can record a female singer on the version you want the public to hear but 
record a male singer when sending the demo to potential clients or artists.
	
✓	Mixes: You can create a project alternative with a loud vocal and one 
with a soft vocal. Or create an alternative without the vocal, in case the 
singer needs to perform the song to a backing track. (See Chapter 19 for 
information on the different alternate mixes you should produce.)
Customizing Your Project Settings
Similar to the Logic Pro X Preferences, your project has its global settings 
that you can adjust. You get to the project settings shown in Figure 2-5 by 
choosing File➪Project Settings.
	
Figure 2-5: 
Set global 
settings for 
your project.
	
Here’s a description of the Preferences panes you can choose at the top of 
the Project Settings window:
	
✓	General: Set the grid to display bars and beats or time. Selecting bars 
and beats stores tempo information in the audio files you create. Storing 
the tempo in files is useful if you’ll use the assets in other projects that 
recognize the data. Using the Time setting also changes the primary 
ruler to display time instead of bars and beats.
                           

27
 Chapter 2: Examining Logic Pro Projects
	
✓	Synchronization: Sync your project to an external device or control 
your project from an external device.
	
✓	Metronome: This window is where you control the internal metronome 
sound generator, uniquely called Klopfgeist. You can also control an 
external click via MIDI if you prefer to use a different sound. When you 
don’t want to hear the metronome while recording, select Only During 
Count-In, which is useful when the sound gets in the way of the prere­
corded media you’re listening to.
	
✓	Recording: Adjust the number of bars or seconds that play before you 
begin recording. The MIDI settings give you several options for record­
ings that overlap. You can create take folders, join the regions, or create 
new tracks. (These settings are covered in depth in Chapter 7.) You can 
also set the audio recording path in this window.
	
✓	Tuning: If you play with a lot of live instruments, such as piano, you 
might need to detune the software instruments that accompany the 
acoustic instruments to make their pitch match. You can also experi­
ment with several alternate scale types, though most people stick with 
Equal Tempered.
	
✓	Audio: The sample rate is important to set here — 44.1 kHz is common 
for CD quality audio, and 44.8 kHz is common for video projects. (Sample 
rates are described in detail in Chapter 5.) You can adjust the automatic 
management and naming of channel strips. If you plan on mixing in sur­
round sound, you can choose your surround format. You can adjust the 
Pan Law, which helps compensate for the fact that sounds get louder if 
they’re in both speakers equally.
	
✓	MIDI: The Input Filter tab on this Preferences pane gives you some 
useful options if your external MIDI device is sending a lot of extra data 
that you don’t need. For example, aftertouch (pressure applied to a key­
board key while it is being held down) and system exclusive data can 
add a lot of data, and if you’re not using those features, turning them off 
makes editing in the list editor much easier because it’s not filled with 
extraneous data.
	
✓	Score: If the MIDI tracks in your project will be printed for musicians to 
play, you can adjust the settings here. This pane has many settings, and 
most are for professional notation. If you plan on printing a lead sheet, 
quick parts, or guitar tablature, you may need to check out these set­
tings. Otherwise, the default settings are often all you need.
	
✓	Movie: If you import a movie into your project to compose a film score, 
Movie Start is a useful setting because movies don’t often start at 0. You 
can also adjust the volume if it’s getting in the way of your work, and 
you can have the movie follow the tempo.
	
✓	Assets: When you select every option in this pane, all your assets are 
copied (not moved, but copied) into the project folder or package. 
Selecting every option is the safest way to go because all your assets are 
in one place, but you might not want to go this route if you’re concerned 
about your hard drive space.
                           

28
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
	
After you adjust your project settings the way you like, save your project as 
a template (choose File➪Save as Template). That way, when you start a new 
project, you won’t have to repeat your work. Project templates save you time 
and give your clicking finger relief so you can use it for more creative pursuits.
Import settings and content 
from other projects
What if you’ve already started a project but have another project that’s 
set up the way you want? Importing settings from other projects into your 
current project is a breeze. Choose File➪Project Settings➪Import Project 
Settings. A dialog asks you to find the project from which you want to import 
settings. Select the project, choose Import, and the window in Figure 2-6 
appears, displaying the settings you can import into your project. Select the 
project settings you want to copy and click Import.
	
Figure 2-6: 
Copy set-
tings from 
other 
projects.
	
If you want to import track content (the audio and MIDI regions) and channel 
strip settings from another project, you use another project import option. 
Choose File➪Import➪Logic Projects. In the dialog that appears, select the 
project from which you want to import and then click Import.
The all files browser opens on the right side of the main window and displays 
the track import view, as shown in Figure 2-7. Track content, plug-ins, effects 
sends (see Chapter 16), I/O (input/output) settings, and automation are 
shown for every track.
Decide what you want to import by selecting the check boxes. You can 
also bring in markers and other global track content. When you’re ready 
to import, click Add to import the content into the current project or click 
Replace to import the data and replace the content of the currently selected 
track. Replace mode works on only a single track at a time.

The Import Project Settings button gives you the same dialog as File➪Project 
Settings➪Import Project Settings does. As you can see, you can import informa­
tion into your current project in several ways.
Another way to get to the projects import function is to use the all files browser 
and navigate to a Logic project. Choose View➪Show Browsers or press the F key. 
Click the All Files tab of the browser, select the project from which you want to 
import, and double-click the project or click the Import button at the bottom of 
the browser. The browser displays the track import view, and you can choose 
what you would like to import into your current project.
Export your project for collaboration
You might want to export your project for several reasons. Perhaps you want 
to collaborate with other artists or you want to work on your project in a 
different software application. You can also export portions of your project 
for use in other projects. To export regions, MIDI selections, tracks, and the 
entire project, begin by choosing File➪Export.
                           

30
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
Exporting regions
To export a region and add it to your Apple loop library, choose File➪Export➪
Region to Loop Library. The dialog shown in Figure 2-8 appears. Name your 
file, choose the loop type, select the scale and genre, and add other tags and 
instrument descriptors. Click Create to export your Apple loop and add it to 
the loop library.
If you simply want to export the region to your hard drive as an audio file, 
choose File➪Export➪Region as Audio File. In the dialog that appears, select 
the file location, audio file format, and bit depth.
Exporting MIDI selections
You can export a selection of MIDI tracks as a MIDI file by choosing File➪ 
Export➪Selection as MIDI File. Selecting more than one MIDI region will 
result in a single MIDI file.
Exporting tracks
To export your tracks for use in a different audio application, such as Pro 
Tools, choose File➪Export➪All Tracks as Audio Files. In the dialog that 
appears, select the audio format, the bit depth, and other options that will 
determine how the tracks are processed before they are exported. If your 
exported audio tracks will be mixed in another application, it’s best to select 
the Bypass Effect Plug-ins and Include Volume/Pan Automation options.

 Chapter 2: Examining Logic Pro Projects
	
If you’re collaborating with a Pro Tools user, add an empty MIDI track to your 
project and export it separately. That way, if you have marker data, it will be 
exported along with the tempo information, and your Pro Tools user will have 
a marker and tempo map to import with the audio files. The Pro Tools user 
will thank you and treat you like a hero!
Exporting projects
Exporting a project as an AAF (Advanced Authoring Format) file is another 
option for collaborating with Pro Tools users. Choose File➪Export➪Project 
as AAF File. All the used regions will be exported, including their track and 
position references and volume automation.
To export a project as a Final Cut Pro XML file, choose File➪Export➪Project 
to Final Cut Pro XML. Software instruments and automation data are exported 
as audio, but MIDI tracks are ignored.
You can export your MIDI score as a MusicXML file if you want to edit the 
notation in a program such as Sibelius or Finale or in a music optical charac­
ter recognition (OCR) application such as SmartScore or PhotoScore. Cubase 
and Sonar can also import MusicXML files. Select the MIDI you want to 
export, open the score editor by choosing Window➪Open Score Editor, and 
then choose File➪Export➪Score as MusicXML.
Tidying Up Your Project
When you work on your projects, you’ll probably try lots of things, record 
takes that don’t make the mix, and basically add a bunch of audio and MIDI 
data that doesn’t need to be there when it comes time to share or archive 
your project. You should give your project a spring-cleaning to get it ready 
for the next season in its life. If you plan to send your project to a collabora­
tor or archive it because it’s finished, you’ll appreciate the following useful 
tools in the File➪Project Management menu:
	
✓	Clean Up: Deletes unused files, backups, and media browser files, as 
shown in Figure 2-9. This function is safe to use because it deletes only 
unused data. However, it deletes media you may have shared with the 
media browser, so sharing with the media browser isn’t the best strategy 
if you want your media to be available for other projects or other appli­
cations in the future.
	
✓	Consolidate: Creates a copy of all the assets you select and includes 
them in the project, as shown in Figure 2-10. If you haven’t been includ­
ing assets in your project up until now, this is your chance to pull every­
thing into your project. This function is useful also when you want to 
share the project for collaboration because the Logic Pro user you’re 
sharing with might not have the same samples or content installed.

✓	Rename: Opens a dialog asking you to select your new project name. 
(This function is similar to using the File➪Save As command.)
	
✓	Show in Finder: Opens a Finder window with your project selected. Use 
this function when you need to get to your project file quickly.
Now that your project is nice and tidy, it’s important to think about protect­
ing it for the future. A good backup strategy can save you from downtime and 
avoidable, life-shortening stress. Hard drives fail, so back up your project 
files on CD or DVD and consider using a service that allows you to back up 
offsite. Also, because Logic Pro X will probably not be the final version of this 
amazing software, export your tracks as audio files so that you can import 
them into a version of Logic Pro down the line. Your future self will thank you.

▶	Saving time and speeding up your workflow
L

ogic Pro X has a simple single-window design that helps you be more 
productive and puts everything you need only a click away. You can do 
most of what you need to do right in the main window. But you can also open 
windows separately and push windows to different displays. The program is 
as flexible as it is simple.
In this chapter, you discover how to navigate the Logic Pro interface. You also 
learn some timesaving tricks and smart ways to use key commands to accom­
plish the bulk of your work. Navigating Logic Pro X with speed and purpose 
will put your music out in the world and build your project catalog. You’ll be 
zipping around Logic Pro in no time.
Navigating Logic Pro
To get the most out of Logic Pro X, you should know the name and purpose 
of each area of the main window. Plus, if you ever need to contact the folks in 
product support, you’ll be able to communicate the problem with precision.

Getting comfortable in the main window
The main window, shown in Figure 3-1, was called the arrange window in ear­
lier versions of Logic Pro. The main window title makes more sense because 
you can use it to do a lot more than just arrange. The name also stresses the 
importance of this Logic Pro key element. As the highly effective Stephen 
Covey once said, “The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.”
	
Figure 3-1: 
The Logic 
Pro X main 
window.
	
The main window includes the tracks area and the control bar. It’s highly 
customizable and gives you all the tools you need to begin making music. To 
display the main window, choose View on the main menu bar.
Working in the tracks area
The tracks area, shown in Figure 3-2, contains your project’s tracks of audio 
and MIDI regions. When you create a project, Logic Pro asks you what type of 
track you would like to create. The tracks you create are added to the verti­
cal track list to the left of the tracks area. To create more tracks, click the 
new tracks (plus sign) icon at the top of the track list or choose Tracks➪New 
Tracks. I cover the track list in more detail later in this chapter.

window.
	
	
Download a Logic Pro X project template with several tracks and regions so 
you can follow along with the examples in this chapter. Visit http://
logicstudiotraining.com/lpxfordummies.
The toolbar above the tracks area, shown in Figure 3-3, contains several 
menus to help you work.
Figure 3-3: 
The tracks 
area toolbar.
Here’s an overview of what’s available in the menus: 
	
✓	The Edit menu gives you several functions that you can apply to your 
regions, including basic functions such as copy and paste and region-
specific functions such as splitting, joining, and repeating. The options 
in this menu are almost identical to the options in the Edit submenu 
in the main application menu, so you have two places to execute com­
mands. This feature is useful when you don’t have the main window 
open and are working in an editor in a separate window. For details on 
editing audio and MIDI, see Chapters 14 and 15.
	
✓	The Functions menu gives you even more actions to take on your 
regions, such as naming and coloring your tracks and regions, MIDI 
quantizing (snapping your MIDI events more precisely to the time grid) 
                           

36
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
and transforming, and removing silence from audio regions. When you 
want to do something to a region, check out the Functions and Edit 
menus first.
	
✓	The View menu gives you more viewing options and useful tweaks to the 
tracks area. If Advanced Editing is selected in the Advanced Preferences 
pane (see Chapter 1), you have a Link option to control the relation­
ship between open windows. Selecting the secondary ruler is useful 
when you want to view your project ruler in clock time as well as in bars 
and beats. The marquee ruler gives you a visual indicator of selections 
you’ve made with the marquee tool. You can get rid of the grid in the 
tracks area if you’re working in free time or if it gets in the way visually. 
The Scroll in Play option continually scrolls the tracks area as you play.
	
	I turn off the Scroll in Play option because I like my tracks area to snap 
when it reaches the end instead of continually scrolling. The tracks area 
behaves more like sheet music, where you have to turn a page when you 
get to the end, but Logic Pro is your personal page turner. I find it harder 
to follow the tracks area when it scrolls.
	
✓	To the right of the View menu are icons to display or hide automation 
and futuristic flex modes (more on flex editing in Chapter 14) and catch 
the playhead, that is, the tracks area will follow (catch) the playhead 
instead of remaining still.
	
✓	In the center of the toolbar are two tool menus. The left tool menu is the 
currently selected tool that’s visible when your cursor is in the tracks 
area. The right tool menu selects the ⌘-tool that becomes available 
when your cursor is in the tracks area and you press the ⌘ key. Both 
tool menus are described in detail later in the chapter.
	
✓	The snap function makes dragging regions easier. You can choose the 
snap mode from the drop-down menu to the right of the tool menus. 
Smart mode is usually all you need until you’re trying to do something 
specific. At the top of the drop-down menu, you can choose a finer snap 
value if you need to move a region more precisely. If you snap a region 
to a relative value and the region doesn’t start exactly on the beat, it will 
move relative to its current position. That’s the default value and usually 
what you want, until you need to move something more precisely. To 
make use of snap modes, select Snap to Grid in the Edit menu.
	
✓	To the right of the snap modes is your drag mode drop-down list. The 
different drag modes allow you to overlap, not overlap, crossfade, or 
shuffle regions in a track. Overlap mode preserves the region borders 
of the selected region when you drag it on top of another region. No 
Overlap shortens the right boundary of the region on the left. X-Fade 
creates a crossfade the length of the overlapped area.
	
	The shuffle modes move the regions in the direction of the particular 
shuffle mode selection; in addition, resizing a region resizes all the 
regions, and deleting a region moves the regions by the length of the 
deleted region. Shuffle is a complicated function that is used mostly in 
                           

37
 Chapter 3: Exploring the Main Window and Tracks Area
audio situations such as editing voice-overs or audio interviews and not 
in musical settings. Only one audio region can be played at a time, so 
any part of a region that’s hidden won’t be heard.
	
✓	Finally, on the far right of the toolbar are a zoom button that zooms your 
audio waveforms and sliders that control the vertical and horizontal 
track zoom.
Controlling the control bar
The control bar, which is shown in Figure 3-4, is located at the top of the main 
window. It contains view icons that show and hide windows, transport con­
trols for playback and recording, an LCD display area for viewing important 
information about your project, and icons for different behavior modes and 
specific functions.
Figure 3-4: 
The control 
bar.
You can customize the control bar by Control-clicking an empty area and 
choosing the Customize Control Bar option. On my 13-inch MacBook Air, I 
can’t see all the default control bar items, so I always customize it to show 
only what I need.
	
After you customize the control bar the way you like it, save it as a template 
so you can recall it later. You can also import your customized control bar 
from another project by importing the project’s screensets. You’ll learn more 
about screensets later in this chapter.
When you become comfortable using key commands to navigate Logic Pro, 
you may never need to click the control bar. But it still provides a good 
heads-up display, indicating whether certain functions are engaged.
The leftmost group of view icons displays the library, inspector, and toolbar. 
To the right of the view icons are the Quick Help icon and the editor icons. 
Here’s a brief description of what these icons allow you to do:
                           

38
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
	
✓	The library is where you load and save settings for recall later. It’s like 
having a modular studio where you can save and load entire mixer 
setups, guitar amp settings, or even groups of software instruments. The 
library is one of the most powerful new features in Logic Pro X, and you 
find out about it throughout the book. The key command to open the 
Library is Y.
	
✓	The inspector icon opens a dynamic editing window for the object or 
objects currently selected in the tracks area. The inspector is more like 
three inspectors in one. It inspects the selected track, the channel strip 
where you adjust the track’s sound, and the selected region or regions. 
The key command to open the inspector is I.
	
✓	The toolbar icon puts a customizable row of functions along the bottom 
of your control bar. You can customize the toolbar by Control-clicking it 
and choosing Customize Toolbar. When you’re new to Logic Pro, display­
ing this toolbar is helpful. When you’ve memorized the key commands 
or need more screen real estate, however, you might want to hide the 
toolbar. You can do so by pressing Control-Option-⌘-T.
	
✓	The quick help icon is another good tool for new Logic Pro users. Click 
this icon when the inspector is displayed, and you’ll see details for what­
ever your cursor is hovering over. If the inspector isn’t displayed, you’ll 
see a floating window with the same details. The quick help icon doesn’t 
have a key command, but you can create one for it. Details on creating 
key commands are provided later in the chapter.
	
✓	The smart controls icon opens an editor that’s new in Logic Pro X. The 
smart controls are displayed in the main window below the tracks area. 
The content of the smart controls editor depends on the selected track. 
Smart controls decide which parameters you need the most, and they do 
an almost perfect job. The key command to open the smart controls is B.
	
✓	The mixer icon opens the pristine-sounding or dirty-sounding mixer, 
depending on how you decide to mix it. The mixer is so versatile and 
great that it gets plenty of attention throughout this book, including an 
entire chapter on mixing (Chapter 16). Like the smart controls, the mixer 
appears at the bottom of the tracks area. The key command to open the 
mixer is X.
	
✓	The editors icon displays the group of editors associated with the 
selected region type. The editors open at the bottom of the tracks 
area; which editors you see depends on whether you have an audio, a 
MIDI, or a drummer region selected. All editors are covered in detail in 
Chapters 14 and 15. The key command to open the editors is E.
	
✓	The transport is a collection of icons that provide basic controls for play­
ing, recording, pausing, stopping, forwarding, rewinding, and generally 
navigating your project. You can customize the control bar to contain 
your choice of 17 transport icons.
                           

39
 Chapter 3: Exploring the Main Window and Tracks Area
	
	Because all these functions are easily performed with key commands, I 
display only the most important controls on my transport. I always dis­
play the stop, play, and record icons because when you click and hold 
down on them, you see additional options that you often need to adjust 
throughout your work.
	
✓	The LCD display indicates the current location of the playhead. You can 
see your project in beats, time, or a customized display. To change the 
display mode, click the left section of the display and make a selection. 
A useful feature of the custom display options is to open a giant beats or 
time display in a separate floating window for viewing from afar.
	
	You can enter data directly into the LCD display by double-clicking 
or click-dragging (for tempo and location). You edit other key project 
parameters, such as key and time signatures, by clicking the display and 
manually entering the data.
	
	During hard-drive- and processor-intensive work, such as recording and 
mixing, I like to show the load meters in the display so I know how far 
I’m pushing my computer.
	
✓	To the right of the LCD display are several mode and function icons. You 
can customize the control bar so that is displays your most important 
modes and functions.
	
	A few mode icons, such as cycle mode, are useful to have available, even 
if you know the corresponding key command, because their pressed 
state lets you know quickly whether the mode is enabled. And some 
icons, such as the tuner, don’t have corresponding key commands so it’s 
handy to have them on the control bar.
	
✓	On the far right of the control bar is another group of view icons. The 
list editors icon opens a window on the right side of the tracks area with 
four tabs: Event, Marker, Tempo, and Signature. Each tab gives you edit­
ing access to the smallest details of your project data. The Event tab 
updates its display depending on what you have selected. The Marker, 
Tempo, and Signature tabs show events that affect your project globally. 
The key command to open the list editors window is D.
	
✓	The notepad icon opens a window on the right side of the tracks area 
with two tabs of notes: Project and Track. I keep copious notes through­
out my project, so I open these tabs a lot. The Project notes tab is a 
great place to write song lyrics. You could use the Track notes tab as 
a change log, so you don’t forget what you’ve tried out or how you’ve 
edited your track. The key command to open the notepad is Option-⌘-P.
	
✓	The Apple loops icon opens a loop browser in a window on the right 
side of the tracks area. You can filter your loops by using the descriptive 
icons or you can search for them directly in the search field. Selecting 
a loop automatically auditions it. When you find one you like, drag it to 
the bottom of the tracks area, where you see the Drag Apple Loops Here 
text. The key command to open the Apple loop browser is O.
                           

40
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
	
✓	The browser icon opens a window on the right side of the tracks area 
with three tabs: Project, Media, and All Files. The project browser 
shows you all the audio in your project. The media browser shows you 
all the media on your computer that is indexed by iTunes, GarageBand, 
and Logic Pro, as well as the movies in your User Movies folder. The all 
files browser works similarly to Finder; you can navigate to any loca­
tion on your computer to import media. The key command to open the 
browser is F.
	
✓	The master volume slider is a new feature in Logic Pro X and might be 
familiar to GarageBand users. Because GarageBand doesn’t have a mixer, 
the master volume slider is the main way to turn your project volume 
up or down. In Logic Pro X, a master fader in the mixer serves the same 
function as the master volume slider on the control bar, so the slider 
isn’t necessary.
As you can see, the control bar gives you lots of, well, control. Even though 
most of these modes and functions are available as key commands, having 
them in your line of sight can help your workflow. For starters, you can click 
them. But more than that, they make great visual reminders of what you can 
do with Logic Pro. And if you’re up to the challenge, you can use them to help 
you memorize their key commands.
Polishing in the editors area
The control bar editor icons and corresponding key commands aren’t the 
only ways to open the various editors. Double-click an audio, a MIDI, or a 
drummer region and the corresponding editor will open at the bottom of 
the tracks area. An audio region defaults to the audio track editor. A MIDI 
region defaults to the piano roll editor, shown in Figure 3-5. A drummer region 
defaults to the drummer editor.
Figure 3-5: 
The editors 
area.
                           

41
 Chapter 3: Exploring the Main Window and Tracks Area
In the audio and MIDI editor windows, you’ll see tabs for additional editors. 
The MIDI editor displays tabs for the score and step editors in addition to 
the piano roll editor. The audio editor shows a tab for the audio file editor in 
addition to the audio track editor.
Just like the tracks area, the editors area has a toolbar with edit, functions, 
and view menus; icons; tool menus; and snap and zoom settings. (You find 
out what the editors can do in Chapters 14 and 15.) When you learn how to 
navigate the tracks area, you’ll have a pretty easy time navigating the editors.
Investigating the inspector
The inspector, shown in Figure 3-6, is an important tool, and you’ll quickly 
memorize its key command, I. (When you’ve memorized the key command, 
consider deleting the inspector icon on the control bar to free up space.) The 
inspector can take up a lot of space in the main window, but it’s integral to 
editing your tracks and shaping your sound.
	
Figure 3-6: 
The 
inspector.
	
                           

42
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
At the bottom of the inspector are two channel strips. The strip on the left 
corresponds to the currently selected track. The strip on the right is dynamic 
and is discussed further in Chapter 16. Above the channel strips are two 
panes that you can open and close:
	
✓	The track inspector pane gives you details about the entire track. You 
can change the track icon here, which I love to do. You discover what 
the track inspector can do in Chapter 4.
	
✓	The region inspector shows you details about the currently selected 
region or regions. The details in both the region and track inspector 
panes depend on what kind of track or region is selected.
Understanding the difference between the track and region inspector panes 
will save you from a lot of confusion as you work. You discover more about 
tracks and regions in Chapter 4.
Taking Inventory of Your Track List
Every track you create is added to the track list and given a track header, as 
shown in Figure 3-7. You can reorder tracks by dragging the track headers to 
new locations in the list. To select more than one track at a time, ⌘-click the 
track headers. You can delete tracks by choosing Track➪Delete Track or by 
Control-clicking the track header and choosing Delete Track. You can also 
navigate your track list by using the up and down arrow keys.
	
Figure 3-7: 
A track 
header.
	
Make headway with track headers
Track headers are customizable and resizable. Choose Track➪Configure 
Track Header (or press Option-T) to display the Track Header Configuration 
dialog shown in Figure 3-8. Select the additional items you want to see in your 
track headers and click Done. You can also Control-click any track header 
to pull up the Track Header Configuration dialog. You can resize the track 
header vertically or horizontally by placing your cursor at the top, bottom, 
or right edge of the track header and dragging when your cursor changes to 
the resize pointer.

 Chapter 3: Exploring the Main Window and Tracks Area
	
Figure 3-8: 
Track header  
configuration 
dialog.
	
By default, all the buttons and controls aren’t shown on the track headers. 
Here’s a brief description of the track header configuration options:
	
✓	Control Surface Bars: Select this option to add on the far left of the 
track header a thin bar that indicates whether the track is being con­
trolled by a control surface. A control surface, such as your iPad, is a 
hardware device that allows you to control a digital audio workstation 
such as Logic Pro. Many MIDI controllers can also be used as control 
surfaces, which allow you to use hardware to control the onscreen 
faders, knobs, buttons, and displays. To read an in-depth manual on con­
trol surfaces, choose Help➪Logic Pro Control Surfaces Support.
	
✓	Track Numbers: Select the Track Numbers option to display the track 
number on the left of the track header. Selecting this check box also 
gives you the option to select the Color Bars check box, which colorizes 
the track numbers area and visually organizes your tracks. You find out 
more about track colors in the next section.
	
✓	Groove Track: You can set one track in your project as the groove track 
and select other tracks to follow the timing of the groove track. When 
a groove track is selected, a star will appear to the right of the track 
number and all other tracks will have check boxes that you can select to 
make a track follow the groove track. For the details on groove tracks, 
see Chapter 13.
                           

44
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
	
✓	Track Icons: If you Control-click the track icon in the track header, you 
can choose a new icon from the icon pop-up menu. Track icons are 
useful visual indicators and look cool, too.
	
✓	Additional Name Column: Add a name column to the right of the track 
name. You can also customize what the column displays by using the 
drop-down menu in the track header configuration dialog.
	
✓	On/Off: Use the on/off icon to save processing power. To turn off tracks, 
you must select Show Advanced Tools in the Advanced Preferences 
pane (see Chapter 1). When a track is turned off, it is silenced.
	
✓	Mute/Solo: The mute icon silences the track. You can mute all tracks 
by pressing ⌘ while you click the mute icon. The solo icon mutes every 
track except the soloed track. You can mute or solo multiple tracks at 
once by clicking and holding down on the icon and dragging your cursor 
up or down the track list.
	
✓	Protect: This icon prevents changes to the track. With the protect icon 
enabled, you won’t be able to record or edit the track. Protecting a track 
is useful when you want to make sure it remains exactly as it is, without 
accidental changes.
	
✓	Freeze: When you freeze a track, you reduce processing power on the 
track by temporarily turning the track and all its audio effects into an 
audio file. This feature is useful for software instruments and audio 
tracks with lots of plug-in effects that require a lot of processing power. 
With freeze enabled, all plug-ins (including software instruments) are 
temporarily deactivated and the track is turned into an audio file that 
includes all effects.
	
✓	Record Enable: Click the record enable icon to enable your track for 
recording.
	
✓	Input Monitoring: This icon allows you to monitor audio tracks that 
aren’t enabled for recording. Use this icon whenever you need to set 
audio levels for recording or to practice a part you plan to record.
	
✓	Volume/Pan: If you’re used to working in GarageBand, having your 
volume and pan control in the track header might help you get accus­
tomed to Logic Pro. I’m usually in need of more workspace in the tracks 
area, so I don’t display these. Plus, I find the mixer controls better suited 
for the job. But when I’m on a bigger computer screen, I like to fill my 
track headers. The volume slider does double-duty as a level meter. You 
can change the pan control to an effects send control. You learn more 
about send effects in Chapter 16.
	
You can quickly rename a track in the track header by pressing Shift-Return 
and typing the new name. You can get through the entire track list by pressing 
Tab between each new name.
                           

45
 Chapter 3: Exploring the Main Window and Tracks Area
Make it pretty with track colors
Track colors not only make your tracks pretty but also help you identify 
tracks and groups of tracks quickly. In the track header configuration dialog 
(refer to Figure 3-8), you can display the color bars to aid visual recognition. 
When you create new regions on a track, they are also colorized in the same 
color. You can even change the color of regions independently of the track 
color. However, selecting a track automatically selects all the regions on 
the track, so if you colorize a track while all the regions are selected, those 
regions will also change color.
To change a track color, Control-click a track and choose Assign Track Color. 
You’ll be shown a beautiful palette of 72 color swatches that you can use to 
colorize your selected tracks and regions. By default, MIDI tracks are color­
ized green and audio tracks are blue. I always group my tracks by color. 
Drums get their own color, lead vocals get their own color, background 
vocals get a different color — you get the idea. Group your groups with color.
Zooming Tracks
You’ll probably need to zoom in and out of tracks a lot, especially when 
you’re editing. Fortunately, you can zoom tracks in several ways. The first 
trick is to turn on Auto Track Zoom by pressing Control-Z or by choosing 
View➪Auto Track Zoom from the tracks area toolbar. With Auto Track Zoom 
on, as in Figure 3-9, the currently selected track will automatically zoom hori­
zontally. You see not only more of the track contents but also a quick indica­
tor of which track is selected and has focus. The key command makes it easy 
to toggle between the two zoom states.
	
Figure 3-9: 
Auto track 
zoom on a 
selected 
track.
	
                           

46
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
At the top right of the tracks area toolbar are two zoom sliders, vertical to 
the left and horizontal to the right. Drag the sliders to adjust the zoom level. 
You can also use key commands to zoom; I suggest that you memorize them 
because they’re so easy to use. To zoom in on all your tracks vertically, press 
⌘-down arrow; to zoom out, press ⌘-up arrow. Likewise, to zoom in horizon­
tally, press ⌘-right arrow; to zoom out, press ⌘-left arrow.
If you want to zoom in on a specific area of your tracks, you can use the zoom 
tool. It’s always available when your cursor is in the tracks area: Simply press 
Control-Option while dragging over the area you want to zoom. Your cursor 
will temporarily turn into the zoom tool, and the area you select will auto­
matically zoom when you release the cursor. To get back to the previous level 
of zoom, press Control-Option while clicking anywhere in the tracks area.
	
You can recall up to three levels of zoom by using the zoom tool. This means 
you can zoom in on a large portion of your project, zoom in on a smaller sec­
tion, zoom in on a single part of a region, and then recall each one in sequence 
just by pressing Control-Option and clicking the tracks area.
Another useful key command to memorize is Z, which toggles the Zoom to 
Fit Selection or All Contents command. If a region is not selected, this zoom 
command zooms out to fit all the content in the tracks area. The tracks and 
regions are smaller and you can view all your content. If you have any regions 
selected, the same command will zoom in on those regions.
One more zoom to consider is the Waveform Vertical Zoom. Press ⌘-minus (-) 
or ⌘-plus (+) to zoom only your audio waveforms. This zoom feature makes 
your audio waveforms larger in the regions without making the regions them­
selves bigger. I use this feature a lot for audio editing and voice-over work 
when waveforms aren’t tall because they’re not recorded at high volumes. If 
you forget the key command, use the waveform vertical zoom icon to the left 
of the zoom sliders in the tracks area toolbar (refer to Figure 3-9).
	
The default state of zoom should be to see the entire project. You learned how 
to zoom out to see your entire project by pressing Z with no regions selected. 
From that position, you can easily see where you want to focus and get there 
quickly by Option-Command-dragging over the area. When you’re finished, 
zoom back out and decide what to do next. This method of zooming creates 
an efficient workflow.
You can zoom in and out of your project in many other ways, as you discover 
later in the chapter when you read about creating your own key commands.

Your Logic Pro Toolbox
Tools imply work. But Logic Pro is about having fun. So think of your toolbox 
as a fun box. The toolbar in the tracks area has several tools you can play with.
	
Another important key command is T. This key command opens the tools 
menu, as shown in Figure 3-10. In several windows, including the tracks area 
and most of the editors, pressing T opens the tools menu, and you can choose 
a tool with your cursor or with the keyboard shortcuts listed on the right. 
Note that the keyboard shortcut for the default pointer tool is also T, giving 
you an efficient workflow in which you can press T twice to get back to the 
pointer quickly.
	
Figure 3-10: 
The tool 
menu in the 
tracks area.
	
Here’s what’s on the tool menu:
	
✓	Pointer: The pointer is your default tool for selecting and moving things. 
Using the pointer tool, you can copy items by Option-dragging them. 
Grabbing the corners and edges of regions can temporarily cause the 
pointer to take a descriptive shape as an indicator of additional pointer 
functions. Place your cursor over the upper half of the right side of a 
region to turn the cursor into the loop tool. With the loop tool active, 
dragging the region corner to the right loops the region. Place your 
cursor over the lower half of the region’s right side to change the length 
of the region as you drag the corner. You’ll get the hang of the pointer 
quickly because it will be your most-used tool.
	
✓	Pencil: The pencil tool is similar to the pointer tool, in that it can also 
loop, drag, alter length, and even select regions and other events. What 
makes the pencil unique is that it creates regions when you click in

Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
empty track areas. Note that if the project hasn’t been saved and you 
click an empty area with the pencil tool, you’ll be asked about opening 
an audio file.
	
✓	Eraser: The eraser tool deletes regions and events from the tracks area. 
If multiple regions or events are selected and you click one of them with 
the eraser tool, all selected items will be deleted. This tool doesn’t get a 
lot of use because pressing Delete has the same effect. However, if you 
are going to delete several items in a row, clicking with the eraser tool 
is faster than selecting each item one by one and pressing Delete after 
each. And if you’re trying out for the Logic Pro Editing Olympics, every 
keystroke counts.
	
✓	Text: With the text tool selected, you can rename regions and other 
events.
	
✓	Scissors: Use the scissors when you want to split items. The scissors 
tool has a special Option-click behavior that can split a region into por­
tions of equal length. You can also click-drag the scissors tool over a 
region to find the right place to make your split.
	
✓	Glue: The glue tool joins selected items. You can also click-drag over 
items to select them before joining them.
	
✓	Solo: Use the solo tool when you want to listen to only a single region. 
With the solo tool, click and hold down on a region to hear it. You can 
also drag the solo tool through the region to listen to whatever the tool 
touches, a process known as scrubbing.
	
✓	Mute: The mute tool mutes or unmutes the items and other selected 
items it touches. You can select multiple items and mute or unmute 
them all at once or simply click any region to mute or unmute it.
	
	The mute tool is a useful arranging tool because you can quickly hear 
how sections of music will sound without the muted part. Using the 
mute tool on a region is often better than deleting the region if you’re 
not sure you want to commit to the edit.
	
✓	Zoom: You learned how to use the zoom tool previously in this chapter 
by Control-Option-dragging in the tracks area. You can also choose it 
as a tool from the tool menu, which you rarely need to do except when 
you forget the key command, which isn’t likely since you’ll be using it so 
much. Another trick with the zoom tool: If your cursor is over an empty 
part of the tracks area, you only have to press Option to make your 
cursor the zoom tool.
	
✓	Fade: With the fade tool, you can fade in and fade out the volume of 
your audio regions by dragging over the start or end of the region, 
respectively. You may need to zoom in horizontally to see the fade that’s 
applied to the region. You can edit the length of the fade by dragging the 
start or end point with the fade tool. You can also adjust the curve of the 
fade by dragging up or down within the start and end points.

 Chapter 3: Exploring the Main Window and Tracks Area
	
✓	Automation Select: I discuss automation in detail in Chapter 17. When 
automation is active, the automation select tool allows you to select 
automation data for editing. Show Advanced Tools in the Advanced 
Preferences pane must be selected to enable automation tools.
	
✓	Automation Curve: You can bend an automation curve by dragging it 
with the automation curve tool. (You find out more about automation in 
Chapter 17.)
	
✓	Marquee: Use the marquee tool to select and edit regions and parts of 
regions. You drag the marquee tool over the objects you want to select 
or edit. After you’ve made a selection with the marquee tool, clicking 
Play on your transport will start your project at the beginning of your 
selection and playback will stop at the end of the selection. The mar­
quee selection can also be used for punch recording, which you learn 
about in Chapter 6. The marquee tool is flexible, and you’ll use it a lot 
throughout this book.
	
✓	Flex: The flex tool is going to blow your mind when you learn more 
about it in Chapter 14. With the flex tool selected, you can grab an audio 
region’s waveform to manipulate it and change its rhythm. The flex 
tool will save you from throwing away recordings that contain mistakes 
because you can fix them. It’s like having a time machine.
	
You have two tools available at all times. The first tool, chosen by the left tool 
menu on the menu bar, is the tool that’s currently available. The second tool, 
chosen by the right tool menu, is available by pressing ⌘. You can select any 
tool to be your ⌘-click tool. If you’re slicing a lot of regions, make the scissors 
your ⌘-click tool. Different workflows require different tools, and the ⌘-click 
tool will help you accomplish your work quickly.
Keeping It Simple with Smart Controls
Smart controls are your personal Logic Pro genius bar. Smart controls know 
what you’re trying to achieve and give you the best tools for the job. They 
don’t give you every available parameter — only the most important ones.
Smart controls are dynamic. The controls you’re given depend on the 
selected track and the software instrument or plug-in effects on that track. 
For example, if you have a compressor and EQ plug-in on a track, the smart 
controls will give you a combination of the most important controls of each 
plug-in. If a software instrument track is selected, the smart controls will also 
include parameters that affect the sound of the instrument.
Last but not least, smart controls look cool and make you want to play 
with them.

Opening smart controls
	
	 Click the smart controls icon in the control bar or press the key command 
B to open the smart controls at the bottom of the tracks area, as shown in 
Figure 3-11. I memorized the smart controls key command by remembering 
the word best, as in best controls. You can also choose View➪Show Smart 
Controls. To open smart controls in a new window, choose Window➪Open 
Smart Controls or press ⌘-3.
	
Figure 3-11: 
The smart 
controls.
	
At the top of the smart controls is a menu bar. In the center of the menu bar 
are two buttons to quickly switch between the track’s smart controls and 
dedicated channel EQ. If no EQ is inserted on the track and you press the 
EQ button, a plus sign icon in the center of the control area will allow you to 
insert an EQ into the track’s channel strip instantly.
	
	 If the selected track is a software instrument track, an arpeggiator icon 
appears on the right side of the menu bar, as shown in the margin. An arpeg­
giator turns the chords you play into arpeggios, or one note played after 
another as opposed to simultaneously.
Click the icon to turn on the arpeggiator and a pop-up menu will appear so 
you can choose a preset or adjust the settings. The arpeggiator is a popular 
synth effect across many genres. Many of The Who’s greatest hits feature 
vintage synth arpeggiators and the effect is common in pop and dance 
music. (The arpeggiator and other MIDI effects are covered in more detail in 
Chapter 16.)
	
To enable the smart controls icons and features described in this chapter, 
Show Advanced Tools must be selected in the Advanced Preferences pane. 
Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Advanced Tools and select the Show 
Advanced Tools option.
	
	 On the left side of the smart controls menu bar is the smart controls inspec­
tor icon (shown in the margin) and a Compare button. The icon opens 
the inspector on the left side of the Smart Controls window, as shown in 
Figure 3-12. The Compare button compares the edited smart controls with 
the saved version.

Editing smart control layouts
Smart controls automatically give you quick control over the most important 
parameters, so you won’t need to edit them often. If you want to control a 
parameter that’s not included in the automatic smart control layout, you 
can edit the sound directly in either the software instrument interface or the 
effects plug-ins inserted in the track. (You find out how to adjust the plug-ins 
directly in Chapter 16.)
Think of smart controls as shortcuts to the sound parameters that you use 
most often. For example, if your track contains a software instrument, such 
as an electric piano, the smart controls will give you the knobs that are fre­
quently needed to adjust the sound of an electric piano. If you were to also 
add an effect to the track, the smart controls will readjust based on the new 
setup. Smart controls will continue to adjust as you add or remove effects to 
a track — that’s why they’re smart.
But what if you want to manually customize the smart controls for a particu­
lar purpose? Fortunately, smart controls are as flexible as they are intelligent. 
They also have a menu of gorgeous layouts designed to emulate the look 
and feel of gear you may be familiar with, such as classic guitar amps and 
instruments.
To change the smart controls layout, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the inspector icon.
	
	 The smart controls inspector opens to the left of the screen controls. 
At the top of the inspector is the name of the current layout (refer to 
Figure 3-12). The default layout is Automatic Smart Controls.
	
2.	Click the name of the current layout at the top of the inspector.
	
	 A pop-up menu appears.
	
3.	Make a selection from the menu of layouts.
	
	 The smart controls are updated.
                           

52
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
	
Smart control layouts are predefined. You can’t add knobs, buttons, or other 
controls to the layout, though you can map the relationship between the con­
trols and your track’s parameters, as you discover next.
Manually mapping smart controls
When you open the smart controls and choose Automatic Smart Controls as 
the layout, all the screen controls are mapped to the track parameters auto­
matically. If the controls aren’t mapped to the parameters you want or some 
of the controls remain unmapped, you can both manually and automatically 
map the smart controls.
To map smart controls automatically:
	
1.	Open the smart controls inspector by clicking the inspector icon in 
the smart controls menu bar.
	
2.	Open the Parameter Mapping area by clicking the disclosure triangle 
(refer to Figure 3-12).
	
3.	Click the Parameter Mapping pop-up menu and make a selection as 
follows:
 
• Choose Map All Controls when you want to completely reset the 
controls and have them automatically mapped. Automatically map­
ping your controls is a great starting place and usually gives you 
control over the parameters you need.
 
• Choose Map All Unmapped Controls when you want to map only the 
controls that are currently labeled Unmapped.
You can manually map smart controls in two ways. The first way is to map 
controls by using the Learn button:
	
1.	Open the smart controls inspector.
	
2.	In the layout, select the control that you want to map to a parameter.
	
	 Depending on the current layout, your controls could include knobs, 
faders, switches, buttons, and other interfaces. You should select the 
controller type that’s similar to the parameter you want to control. For 
example, a switch or button will control a parameter that has an on/off 
state, and a knob will control a parameter that has a range.
	
3.	Click the Learn button next to the Parameter Mapping menu in the 
inspector.
	
	 The Learn button flashes orange to indicate that learn mode is active.
                           

53
 Chapter 3: Exploring the Main Window and Tracks Area
	
4.	Click the plug-in or channel strip parameter you want to control.
	
	 For example, you might click the volume slider on the track. (Channel 
strip parameters and plug-ins are described in Chapter 16.)
	
5.	Click the Learn button again to finish mapping controls.
	
	 The selected control now adjusts your track volume.
The first method is great if you know which parameters you want to adjust. 
The second way allows you to map controls by browsing the Parameter 
Mapping pop-up menu.
	
1.	Open the smart controls inspector.
	
2.	Select the control in the layout you want to map to a parameter.
	
	
3.	 Click the parameter mapping disclosure triangle (see the margin) to 
open the mapping area, and then click the parameter name (or click 
Unmapped if the control is unmapped).
	
	 A pop-up menu appears.
	
4.	Choose the parameter you want to control.
	
You aren’t limited to mapping a control to a single parameter. You can add 
additional parameters to the control by clicking the parameter name in the 
inspector and choosing Add Mapping. In addition to adding mappings, you 
can copy and delete mappings from the same pop-up menu.
Editing smart control parameters
After you’ve mapped a control to parameters, you can adjust how the con­
trol modifies the parameters. For example, you might want a volume knob 
to never go all the way down and all the way up. You might want the control 
to modify a specific range. Open the Parameter Mapping area in the inspec­
tor by clicking the disclosure triangle, and you’ll see values that you can edit 
below the parameter name:
	
✓	Range Min: This value sets the minimum range of the parameter.
	
✓	Max: This value sets the maximum range of the parameter.
	
✓	Invert: This check box switches the minimum and maximum values.
	
✓	Scaling: Click the Open button to open a graph to adjust the minimum 
and maximum range values, as shown in Figure 3-13.

Figure 3-13: 
The scal-
ing graph 
window.
	
If you have more than one parameter mapped, you can change the order of the 
parameters by dragging the left side of the parameter name up or down the list.
	
Don’t forget to use the Compare button, which lets you audition changes 
before fully committing to them.
Controlling the controls 
with your controller
A major benefit of smart controls is how much time they save you. Instead 
of having to open plug-ins and instrument interfaces and find the parameters 
you need to change, smart controls give you the most used controls in a 
simple and beautiful interface.
As Steve Jobs would say in every keynote, “But wait, there’s more.” Your MIDI 
controller can control all smart controls. The setup is super fast:
	
1.	Click the inspector icon to display the smart controls inspector.
	
2.	In the layout, click the control that you want to control.

 Chapter 3: Exploring the Main Window and Tracks Area
	
3.	Click the external assignment disclosure triangle to display the assign­
ment name field.
	
4.	Click the Learn button.
	
5.	Move the control on your MIDI device that you want to pair with the 
selected control on the layout.
	
	 As long as the Learn button is enabled, you can continue to select con­
trols in your smart controls layout and move controls on your MIDI 
device to pair the hardware and software.
	
6.	When you’re finished, click the Learn button.
You’ve just paired your MIDI controller with your smart controls and saved 
yourself time. You’re beginning to love Logic Pro X For Dummies, aren’t you? 
And we’re just getting started.
Navigating with Key Commands
The absolute fastest way to navigate Logic Pro is with key commands. I’ve 
talked about key commands quite a bit and don’t intend to stop. I sometimes 
talk about key commands on intimate dates and important holiday gather­
ings. I find them to be festive and captivating. And even if my date doesn’t 
agree that key commands are great conversation starters, I’m sure you will.
Learn any new key commands lately? Open the Key Commands window, 
shown in Figure 3-14, by pressing Option-K or by choosing Logic Pro X➪Key 
Commands➪Edit. Your cursor is automatically placed in the search field. 
Type the name of the command you’re looking for, even if you have to guess 
Smart controls and the 80/20 rule
Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist, discov­
ered that 80 percent of the income in Italy (and 
every country he studied afterwards) was in the 
hands of 20 percent of the population. Since his 
discovery, the 80/20 rule has been applied to 
just about everything: 80 percent of your busi­
ness comes from 20 percent of your clients; 
80 percent of your results come from 20 percent 
of your efforts.
And now I will make the connection between 
Logic Pro X and the 80/20 rule: Smart controls 
give you 20 percent of the controls that you will 
use 80 percent of the time.
Use the 80/20 rule as a lever to get more accom­
plished and with better results. I use it to select 
my opportunities, schedule my time, and guide 
my songwriting. And when you find out that 
your tools are purposefully designed to give you 
80/20 leverage, you can believe that the Logic 
Pro X designers want you to make more music.
Smart controls are your 80/20 lever.

The key command to open the key commands is Option-K. If you can’t remem­
ber which modifier key to use, it doesn’t hurt to try all the modifier keys until 
you get it right. Anything you do to your project you can undo.
From the Key Commands window, you can create your own key commands:
	
1.	Search or browse for the command.
	
2.	Select the command and then click the Learn by Key Label button.
	
	 If you have a keyboard with a numeric keypad and you want to distin­
guish between number keys on the alphanumeric keyboard or numeric 
keyboard, press the Learn by Key Position button instead. A full-size 
keyboard is a great tool for music production. The additional keypad can 
store a lot of key commands.

At the top of the Key Commands window is an Options drop-down menu with 
the following options:
	
✓	Presets: Choose a key command preset for another language and, in 
some instances, other presets installed on your computer.
	
✓	Import Key Commands/Export Key Commands: If you have customized 
key commands that you use regularly and have to work on a different 
computer, you can simply import your key commands from this menu. 
Be a good guest and back up the owner’s key commands first.
	
✓	Copy Key Commands to Clipboard: This menu item is useful if you want 
to print your key commands for reference, all 30 or so pages of them.
	
✓	Expand All/Collapse All: So many key commands are available that it’s 
necessary to group them into categories. Being able to expand and col­
lapse the key command menus will help you browse all your choices.
	
✓	Scroll to Selection: If you have a key command selected at the bottom of 
the list but you’ve travelled to the top of the list looking for another key 
command, you can quickly jump to your selection using this command.
	
✓	Initialize all Key Commands: This item resets all your key commands 
to their original state, erasing all key command modifications you may 
have made. Fortunately, the original set of key commands is a great 
place to start.
To the right of the Options menu is an additional drop-down menu to show 
all, used, or unused key commands. Some functions are available only by 
using a key command. If you open the Key Commands window once a session 
and learn a new key command, it will be a valuable session.

Saving Workspaces with Screensets
As you’ve discovered so far, Logic Pro X has lots of windows, inspectors, 
icons, and interfaces. You could probably imagine having two or three 30-inch 
displays with everything open all at once. So what do you do when you get 
your screen just the way you like it? You create a screenset, a snapshot of 
your current screen layout.
I love screensets. Whenever I move windows around and get them the way I 
like them for a particular job, I save it as a screenset. If I need to do a differ­
ent job with a different focus, I create a new screenset. I give you some ideas 
about how you can use screensets later, but first let me show you exactly 
what screensets are and how they help you make more music.
You’re always using a screenset. The numbered menu to the right of the 
Window menu shows you what screenset is currently selected. Screensets 
store window size and placement, your control bar customization, your zoom 
level, and much more. You can import another project’s screensets by using 
the import project settings (see Chapter 2). You can assign screensets to all 
the number keys except 0, which makes them easy to navigate. You can also 
store double-digit screensets. Press Control for only the first digit of double-
digit screensets (but you still can’t use 0).
To create a screensets, do one of the following:
	
✓	Press any number key from 1–9. If a screenset doesn’t already exist, one 
is created. To create screensets higher than 9, press Control with the 
first digit.
	
✓	Click the Screenset menu (the number in the main menu to the right 
of Window) and choose Duplicate to make a copy of your current 
screenset. Name your screenset in the dialog that appears and press OK.
After you have a screenset exactly how you like it, you can lock it from 
the Screenset menu. You can also delete and rename screensets from the 
Screenset menu.
Screensets are easy to recall because all you have to do is use your number 
keys. Most projects don’t need more than 9 screensets, but it’s nice to know 
you can have as many as you want in case you need them for a specific 
workflow.
Following are some ideas for using screensets:
	
✓	Open the score in a separate window from the main window to reference 
the music notation while you record or edit.
	
✓	Open the Mixer and Floating Transport windows when you’re focusing 
on mixing.
                           

59
 Chapter 3: Exploring the Main Window and Tracks Area
	
✓	Audio and MIDI editing might need windows to be positioned just right 
for a good workflow.
	
✓	Software instruments and their interfaces can get their own screenset 
for quick sound editing or playing.
	
✓	Open a main window with no inspectors or editors so you can see your 
full arrangement quickly. Don’t forget the Z key command, which zooms 
everything to fit in the main window.
	
✓	If you work on a laptop and a desktop computer like I do, you can create 
a set of screensets optimized for the display size and save them as a 
template for either starting projects or importing the screensets into 
current projects.
Here’s how I use screensets. I reserve screenset number 9 for project notes and 
number 8 for track notes. Both screensets have the Notes window open and 
set to the correct tab so I can quickly jot down ideas and references and keep 
a change log. Screenset number 1 is reserved as an ad hoc workspace where I 
can set up windows for specific workflows and then duplicate the screenset to 
its own name and number. Whenever I get the windows just right for what I’m 
about to do, I duplicate it as its own screenset and give it a descriptive name.
You’ve learned why Logic Pro X is a music producer’s powerhouse and time­
saver. It’s capable not only of sounding great but also of bringing out the 
great in you.

Chapter 4
Embracing Tracks and Regions
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding how tracks and regions work
▶	Adjusting your tempo and time signature
▶	Saving track settings for instant recall
▶	Editing and looping regions
T

racks and regions are the basic building blocks of your project. You can 
have up to 255 audio tracks and 255 software instrument tracks in a proj­
ect, so it’s safe to say that you won’t ever run out of tracks.
Each track gives you independent control over the sound and placement of 
a single sound source. These days, multitrack recording might not seem like 
such a big deal because your iPhone has similar capabilities, but it wasn’t that 
long ago when multitrack recording didn’t exist. Now we have nondestructive 
recording and editing with 200 steps of undo history. It’s tempting to say with 
a straight face that you can record better than The Beatles.
Regions are objects on your tracks that you create, edit, and manipulate until 
your ear is content. Regions are versatile containers for your creative ideas.
In this chapter, you find out about several track types and region types as 
well as gain some basic region editing skills.
Knowing Your Track Types
As described in Chapter 3, the tracks you create are added to the vertical 
track list to the left of the tracks area, as shown in Figure 4-1. You create more 
tracks by clicking the new tracks (plus sign) icon at the top of the track list 
or by choosing Tracks➪New Tracks. You can also create specific track types 
with key commands and with the Tracks menu.
In this section, you discover what the different track types do and how to 
create them.

Audio track
An audio track, like the one shown in Figure 4-2, can contain audio regions, 
audio Apple loops, and imported audio files. You use an audio track when 
you want to record a live instrument or a microphone, as described in 
Chapter 6. You can also import prerecorded audio files and loops into your 
project, as described in Chapter 8.
	
Figure 4-2:

track.
	
To create an audio track, do one of the following:
	
✓	Press Option-⌘-A.
	
✓	Choose Track➪New Audio Track.
You can edit audio tracks by using the audio track editor or the audio file 
editor. For more on editing audio, see Chapter 14.
	
You can spot an audio track by the audio waveforms in the track’s regions, as 
shown in Figure 4-2.

 Chapter 4: Embracing Tracks and Regions
Software instrument track
A software instrument track, shown in Figure 4-3, can contain MIDI regions, 
MIDI Apple loops, and imported MIDI files. You use a software instrument 
track when you want to record one of Logic Pro’s software instruments or a 
third-party software instrument that you’ve installed.
	
Figure 4-3:

To create a new software instrument track, do one of the following:
	
✓	Press Option-⌘-S.
	
✓	Choose Track➪New Software Instrument Track.
	
Logic Pro is compatible with third-party Audio Unit (AU) instruments. Audio 
Units are Apple’s own plug-in format. The marketplace for Audio Unit instru­
ments and effects is massive. Lots of great developers are out there to help 
you bring your imagination into reality.
You record MIDI data on software instrument tracks, which are covered in 
Chapter 6. You can edit software instrument tracks by using the piano roll 
editor, score editor, and step editor, which you will learn about in Chapter 15.
Drummer track
A drummer track is used when you want to add a virtual drummer to your 
project. The drummer track, shown in Figure 4-4, won’t let you play its drums 
(sounds like a lot of drummers I know); the only way to control a drum­
mer track is in the dedicated drummer editor, which you’ll learn about in 
Chapter 9.
	
Figure 4-4: 
A drummer 
track.
	
                           

64
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
To create a drummer track, choose Track➪New Drummer Track. Logic Pro 
doesn’t have a built-in key command for this option, so why not create one 
now? I chose Shift-Option-⌘-D for my key command. (For information on cre­
ating key commands, see Chapter 3.)
You learn how to make beats with Drummer in Chapter 9. Drummer, which 
is new to Logic Pro X, plays and sounds amazing. Because Drummer was 
created using human drummers and recording engineers, it sounds natural. 
It can even respond to a track of your choosing. Artificial intelligence has 
arrived and it’s got rhythm.
	
You can have only one drummer track per project. If you would like to add 
a second drummer track, you can convert the first drummer track to MIDI 
regions, but you will no longer be able to use the drummer editor and you’ll 
have to use the regular MIDI editors to control the performance. All this is 
discussed in Chapter 9.
External MIDI track
An external MIDI track, shown in Figure 4-5, can contain MIDI regions. Use an 
external MIDI track when you need to send MIDI data to an external device 
such as a synthesizer or a drum machine. External MIDI tracks make no 
sound of their own, so you must send the MIDI data out to your MIDI device 
and receive the audio signal from your MIDI device on a separate audio track.
	
Figure 4-5: 
An external 
MIDI track.
	
To create a new external MIDI track, do one of the following:
	
✓	Press Option-⌘-X.
	
✓	Choose Track➪New External MIDI Track.
In the tracks area, external MIDI tracks look and behave a lot like software 
instrument tracks, because they both contain MIDI data. But if you open the 
inspector (press I), you’ll see that the channel strip of an external MIDI track 
looks very different than a software instrument track. The external MIDI 
track has no audio capabilities and no plug-ins. A MIDI channel strip, cov­
ered in Chapter 16, is used to route MIDI data through a MIDI port on a MIDI 
channel. Using different MIDI ports and MIDI channels allows you to build a 
project that can communicate with many different external instruments, up 
to 16 channels per instrument.
                           

65
 Chapter 4: Embracing Tracks and Regions
	
External MIDI tracks only send MIDI data out of Logic Pro. If you want to 
receive the audio signal from the external MIDI device, you must create a sepa­
rate audio track to monitor or record the audio.
Track stacks
Track stacks, an innovation in Logic Pro X, help you organize your tracks by 
placing them as subtracks within a main track. You expand and collapse the 
track stack by using the disclosure triangle, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6:  
A track 
stack.
Two types of track stacks are available:
	
✓	Folder stack: A folder stack can control the volume of all the tracks in 
the track stack. All the tracks can be automated, soloed, muted, and 
grouped as a whole. But folder stacks can’t be saved as patches and you 
can’t add effects to the entire group or control their audio output as a 
group.
	
✓	Summing stack: This stack routes audio, saves all tracks and their set­
tings, and can be saved as a patch for later recall. All tracks in a sum­
ming stack send their audio outputs to a collective auxiliary track. You 
find out more about audio routing and auxiliary tracks in Chapter 16.
To create a track stack, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the tracks you want to include in the track stack.
	
	 To select more than one track at a time, hold down the ⌘ key while 
making your selections.
	
2.	Press Shift-⌘-D or choose Track➪Create Track Stack.
	
3.	Select the type of track stack you want to create.
	
	 Your choices are Folder Stack or Summing Stack.
                           

66
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
	
4.	Click Create.
	
	 The tracks are now grouped in a track stack.
You can remove the tracks from a track stack by selecting the track stack and 
choosing Track➪Flatten Stack or pressing Shift-⌘-U.
As mentioned previously in this section, summing track stacks can be saved 
as a patch for instant recall. For example, you can build an entire orches­
tral project with dozens of software instrument tracks (as described in 
Chapter 12) and save the tracks as a patch. Your orchestral track stack is 
then available for all your projects. Like smart controls, track stacks deliver a 
more productive workflow.
To save a summing track stack as a patch, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the summing track stack in the track list.
	
2.	Open the library by pressing Y or by choosing View➪Show Library.
	
3.	Click the Save button at the bottom of the library and name your 
patch.
	
4.	Click Save.
	
	 Your patch is now saved in the library.
To load a patch on a selected track, simply select the patch in the library.
Folder track
A folder track is similar to a track stack, but folder tracks are focused more on 
regions. Track stacks organize tracks; folders organize regions. A folder track, 
shown in Figure 4-7, can contain multiple tracks and their regions but doesn’t 
have its own channel strip.
	
Figure 4-7:  
A folder 
track.	
                           

67
 Chapter 4: Embracing Tracks and Regions
You might use a folder track to
	
✓	Store tracks you’re no longer using
	
✓	Organize the regions of song sections
	
✓	Organize arrangements and parts in a song
	
✓	Sequence longer material, such as albums and musicals
To create a folder track, do the following:
	
1.	Select the regions in the tracks area.
	
2.	In the tracks area toolbar, choose Functions➪Folder➪Pack Folder.
To view the contents of a folder track, double-click the folder. To exit the 
folder, click the leave folder arrow on the far left of the tracks area menu, as 
shown in Figure 4-8.
Figure 4-8: 
Folder track 
contents.
	
After you’ve created a folder track and put some MIDI tracks in it, you can 
move that folder to an empty software instrument track and the MIDI in the 
folder will play the software instrument.
You can unpack a folder by selecting the folder and choosing Functions➪Folder. 
Then choose Unpack Folder to New Tracks if you want to create tracks in the 
tracks area of the current project level, or choose Unpack Folder to Existing 
Tracks to use the existing tracks of the current project level.
As you just discovered, tracks do more than just hold audio and MIDI. They 
are creative instruments that you can play and explore.
Around the Global Tracks
Global tracks, shown in Figure 4-9, contain lanes and data, but they’re global 
to the project. Global settings such as tempo and time signature changes 
affect the entire project, and you set them in your global tracks.

To have all the options mentioned in this book available to you, choose Logic 
Pro X➪Preferences➪Advanced and select all the options.
To display your global tracks, do one of the following:
	
✓	Choose Track➪Global Tracks➪Show Global Tracks.
	
✓	Press G.
	
✓	Click the global tracks icon at the top right of the track headers menu.
You might not see all available global tracks on the screen. To choose which 
global tracks are displayed, do the following:
	
1.	Choose Tracks➪Global Tracks➪Configure Global Tracks or press 
Option-G.
	
2.	Select the global tracks you want to show.
	
3.	Click Done.
Here’s a brief description of the different global tracks:
	
✓	Arrangement track: The arrangement track creates special markers that 
are meant to help you organize your project based on common song sec­
tions, such as chorus, verse, and intro.
	
✓	Marker track: The marker track lets you mark spots on your project. 
You can name your markers, put descriptive text on them, and navigate 
to them by using key commands.
                           

69
 Chapter 4: Embracing Tracks and Regions
	
✓	Movie track: The movie track shows thumbnails of imported movies. 
To import a movie into your project, choose File➪Movie➪Open Movie. 
You can choose to extract the audio from the movie into a track in your 
project.
	
✓	Signature track: The signature track controls both the key signature and 
the time signature of your project. You can change either at any point in 
your project by selecting the pencil tool on the tool menu and clicking 
where you want the change to occur.
	
✓	Transposition track: The transposition track transposes MIDI and Apple 
loops but not audio files. Click the track with the pencil tool to create a 
transposition node. Drag the node up or down and MIDI regions, MIDI 
Apple loops, and audio Apple loops will follow the transposition track.
	
✓	Tempo track: The tempo track defines your object tempo. Double-click 
anywhere in the tempo track lane to create a new tempo node. Adjust 
the tempo by dragging the node up or down.
	
✓	Beat mapping track: The beat mapping track aligns the project tempo to 
the content on your tracks. It’s useful for projects that don’t have a con­
sistently perfect tempo.
Global tracks are covered in even more detail in Chapter 13, where you learn 
about arranging.
Sorting and Hiding Tracks
You can move tracks by dragging the track headers up and down. You can 
also sort tracks automatically according to type or whether or not they are 
being used by choosing Tracks➪Sort Tracks By.
Hiding tracks is useful when you want to clean up your project. You might not 
be ready to delete a track that’s no longer being used, but you want it out of 
the way. Here’s how you can hide tracks:
	
1.	Click the green hide icon on the track header menu (or press H if the 
icon isn’t visible), as shown in Figure 4-10.
	
	 Hide icons will appear also on each track.
	
2.	Click the hide icon on the track you want to hide.
	
	 The icon turns green.
	
3.	Click the hide icon in the track header again.
	
	 The icon turns orange, indicating that tracks are hidden. The track is 
hidden from the track list and the channel strip disappears from the 
mixer.

Hiding 
tracks.
	
To unhide your tracks, click the hide icon in the track header. The tracks are 
again displayed in the track list and mixer.
Knowing the Region Types
The rounded rectangles in your tracks area are called regions. Think of 
regions as flexible placeholders for your audio and MIDI data. Regions can be 
empty, waiting for you to add content, or created as you record new content. 
Regions are references to your MIDI and audio data. They can even reference 
a reference, allowing you to change one region and have all other regions 
follow suit.
In this section, you discover the different types of regions and how to use them.
Audio region
An audio region can be your own audio recording, an audio Apple loop, or an 
imported audio file. Audio regions, shown in Figure 4-11, can be only audio 
tracks. You can identify an audio region by its audio waveforms.
                           

71
 Chapter 4: Embracing Tracks and Regions
	
Figure 4-11: 
An audio 
region.
	
Audio regions contain references to audio files. An audio region isn’t the file 
itself, and this is important to remember. If you split an audio region in half, 
for example, the audio file isn’t split in half. And if you delete a portion of an 
audio region, the audio file isn’t deleted — it simply isn’t referenced by the 
region any more. If you want to get that portion of audio back, all you have to 
do is drag the edge of the region. You learn more about basic region editing 
later in this chapter.
MIDI region
A MIDI region contains MIDI data. MIDI regions can be used on software 
instrument tracks or external MIDI tracks. You can identify MIDI regions by 
their thin rectangle note events, as shown in Figure 4-12.
	
Figure 4-12: 
A MIDI 
region.
	
MIDI regions are more flexible than audio. You can definitely manipulate 
audio beyond recognition, but you can’t remove a single note from an audio 
file and put it on its own track, as you can with MIDI. MIDI regions allow you 
to experiment and compose with complete freedom.
Drummer region
A drummer region can appear only on a drummer track. Drummer regions, 
shown in Figure 4-13, are like a MIDI-audio hybrid region. They look like audio 
but they contain MIDI data. The difference between a drummer region and a 
MIDI region is that you can’t edit the MIDI data directly on a drummer region. 
You have to use the drummer editor to edit the drummer region. However, 
after you’re happy with how a drummer region sounds, you can export the 
region as MIDI to edit in a MIDI editor. For details, see Chapter 9.
                           

72
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
	
Figure 4-13: 
A drummer 
region.
	
Drummer regions don’t allow MIDI input from an external MIDI controller. The 
drummer editor controls the contents of a drummer region. Think of these 
regions as virtual drummers. Drummer is great for songwriting.
Editing Regions
The bulk of your Logic Pro arranging and editing will probably consist of 
working with regions in the tracks area. In this section, you discover the 
basics of editing regions.
Dragging, moving, and resizing regions
Regions can be dragged to different locations on the timeline. They can be 
moved also to different tracks entirely, and they can be resized.
To drag a region, use the pointer or pencil tool to select the region and drag 
it left and right in the tracks area or up and down to a different track. You can 
move regions to tracks of a different type, but they won’t play. Regions must 
be on the correct track type to make a sound. But it’s nice to be able to move 
regions out of the way temporarily on any track and then move them back again.
You can also move regions by using the Edit➪Move menu. Here are your 
options:
	
✓	To Playhead: Move all selected regions to the current playhead position.
	
✓	To Recorded Position: Move a region back to its original recorded posi­
tion. This command works only on time-stamped audio regions.
	
✓	First Transient to Nearest Beat: Move the first transient of an audio 
region to the nearest beat. A transient is a loud and short sound in a 
waveform. This command is useful when the region starts on the beat 
but the first audio waveform transient is after the start of the region.
	
✓	To Selected Track: Move regions to a selected track. The regions will 
keep their current time position.
                           

73
 Chapter 4: Embracing Tracks and Regions
	
✓	Shuffle Left/Shuffle Right: Align regions so that their start or end points 
are aligned with the neighboring region.
	
✓	Nudge Left/Nudge Right: Nudge the region left or right. First set the 
nudge value in Edit➪Move➪Set Nudge Value To.
To resize a region, move your cursor to the lower left or right of the region 
until the cursor changes to the resize cursor, as shown in Figure 4-14. Then 
click and drag to resize the region. A help tag pops up to give you the details 
on your edit.
	
Figure 4-14: 
The resize 
cursor.
	
Several other ways to move and resize regions are available only as key com­
mands. For example, press Control-\ (backslash) for the Set Optimal Region 
Sizes Rounded by Bar. This command is useful when you want your selected 
region’s start and end points to align with the bar.
To find more key commands that move and resize regions, choose Logic Pro 
X➪Key Commands➪Edit. Then search by using the keywords region, move, 
and length or just browse the categories.
	
If you have overlapped regions, you can choose Track➪Other➪New Track for 
Overlapped Regions to put the regions in their own track lane.
Splitting, joining, and deleting regions
Sometimes you want to make two regions out of a single region. This is called 
splitting regions. You can split regions in several ways:
	
✓	Use the scissors tool to split a region wherever you click.
	
✓	Choose Edit➪Split➪Regions at Playhead.
	
✓	Press Control while clicking a region to display an edit menu with sev­
eral split commands.
                           

74
Part I: Leaping into Logic Pro X 
You can join regions to make a single region. This is useful when you’ve done 
a lot of editing and want to simplify your edits into a single region. To join 
regions:
	
1.	Select the regions you want to join.
	
2.	Use the glue tool to click one of the selected regions.
You can join regions also by pressing J or by choosing Edit➪Join➪Regions.
You can delete a region from the tracks area or from the project entirely. To 
delete regions:
	
1.	Select the regions you want to delete.
	
2.	Use the eraser tool to click one of the selected regions.
You can delete regions also with the Delete key or by choosing Edit➪Delete.
Deleting MIDI regions automatically deletes them from the project. Deleting 
audio regions removes the audio from the tracks area but not from the proj­
ect. You can find the audio files that have been deleted from the tracks area 
in your project audio browser, as detailed in Chapter 8.
Snapping regions to a grid
When you move regions, they snap to the grid based on the snap settings in 
the tracks area menu bar. The following snap values are available:
	
✓	Smart: The Smart setting snaps regions to the nearest value on the grid 
and depends on the current ruler division and level of zoom. This setting 
is usually all you need except when you want to get specific.
	
✓	Bar: This setting snaps regions to the nearest bar.
	
✓	Beat: This setting snaps regions to the nearest beat.
	
✓	Division: This setting snaps regions to the nearest division based on the 
project time signature.
	
✓	Ticks: This setting snaps regions to the nearest clock tick, which is 
1/3840 of a beat.
	
✓	Frames/Quarter Frames: These settings snap regions to the nearest 
SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) timecode 
frame.
	
✓	Samples: This setting snaps regions to the nearest sample, which 
depends on your project sample rate.
	
✓	Off: This setting turns off the snap function.

 Chapter 4: Embracing Tracks and Regions
Looping and copying regions
Want to hear a musical part again? And again? And again? Copy or loop your 
regions.
Repetition is an important part of music composition, so Logic Pro enables 
you to repeat regions in the tracks area. To place a copy of a region at a new 
location, Option-drag the region to the new location on the track. Here’s 
another way to copy and paste regions:
	
1.	Select the region you want to copy.
	
2.	Press ⌘-C or choose Edit➪Copy.
	
3.	Place the playhead where you want to paste the region.
	
4.	Press ⌘-V or choose Edit➪Paste.
If you want the region to repeat continuously for any length of time, you 
can loop it. The benefit of looping is that if you edit the original region, all 
the loops are edited as well. Loops reference the original region; they aren’t 
copies of the region.
To create a loop, place the cursor in the upper-right corner of the region 
you want to loop, and the cursor turns into the loop cursor, as shown in 
Figure 4-15. Drag the cursor as far as you want the region to loop.
	
Figure 4-15: 
The loop 
cursor.
	
You can loop both audio and MIDI regions. Looping regions saves a lot of time 
when you’re mocking up your arrangement.
Tracks and regions are fundamental to your workflow. With just a little experi­
ence, you’ll understand how to get the most from them. And now you know 
some basic editing as well as how to save track settings for instant recall by 
using track stacks. With these fundamental skills, you’re ready to dive in to 
digital audio and MIDI and begin recording some music.

E

ven though Logic Pro does a great job of giving you exactly what you 
need, understanding the basics of digital audio and MIDI are still impor­
tant for making high-quality recordings. One of the first steps you take with a 
project is defining your project’s audio settings. These settings can have a big 
effect on the sound quality of your recordings. Your project’s audio settings 
can also affect compatibility with your hardware and other audio systems.
In this chapter, you find out how to set up Logic Pro to get the best sound 
quality. You discover how to connect your audio and MIDI devices and avoid 
common pitfalls. You also choose the recording audio file type that’s right for 
the job
Understanding Digital Audio
So what’s the big difference between digital and analog audio anyway? In 
analog recording, a representation (an analog) of the sound source is repro­
duced on a physical medium, such as records or tape. In digital recording, 
multiple measurements are taken of the sound source and stored digitally 
as binary code, or 1s and 0s. The process of measuring and recording digital 
audio is called sampling.
                           

80
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
The sample rate is how often a slice of audio is turned into a digit each second. 
The higher the sample rate, the higher the audio fidelity. You want high-quality 
audio even if your goal is to mangle and distort it. The noise you introduce into 
your audio should be a choice, not the result of a misunderstanding.
You also want a wide dynamic range, which is the ratio of loudest to quietest 
sound. Dynamic range is measured in decibels, or dB. CDs have a dynamic 
range of about 90 dB. Logic Pro is capable of 24-bit recording and has a 
dynamic range of around 125 dB. You’ll be pleased that Logic Pro is capable 
of recording audio at and exceeding industry standards, depending on your 
hardware capabilities.
In this section, you find out how to set your project’s sample rate and bit 
depth, and you choose the best audio file type for your project. This knowl­
edge will ensure high sound quality and compatibility.
Acoustics 101
Ready to get out your calculus textbooks and start plotting sine waves? 
You’re not? Phew. Me neither. But it’s important to define some audio terms 
so you understand the choices you make as you record digital audio.
After you understand some basic acoustic theory, you’ll be able to identify 
how the choices you make in Logic Pro affect what you hear. Without getting 
too technical and long-winded, let’s define some aspects of sound:
	
✓	Frequency is the number of cycles completed by a sound wave in one 
second, as shown in Figure 5-1. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz).
	
✓	Wavelength is the distance traveled over one cycle of a sound wave.
	
✓	Period is the duration of a sound wave cycle in time and is inversely pro­
portional to frequency. The lower the frequency, the longer the period.
Here’s why understanding some audio fundamentals is important. Audio has 
to travel through the atmosphere to get to you so you can perceive it. A low 
E string on a bass guitar has a frequency of 41.2 Hz and takes about 27 feet 
to complete a full cycle. Bass frequencies travel far, so you can hear the low 
boom of a loud car stereo coming a mile away. But bass doesn’t always sound 
good in a small space because it can’t complete a full wavelength without 
hitting a wall and bouncing around the room. And before you know it, all 
those bass frequencies pile on each other and multiply, causing room modes. 
Room modes are frequencies that can be too loud or too quiet based on how 
sound reacts to the room’s dimensions.

file editor.
	
Knowing a little bit about audio will enable you to make adjustments to your 
sound to improve its quality. Knowing what frequency is and that every 
sound is made up of multiple frequencies will help you as you record and mix 
your audio. In the upcoming sections, I keep the technical information to a 
minimum and the discussion as practical as the subject will allow.
Set your sample rate
Setting your project sample rate is one of the first things you should do 
before you begin recording audio. If your project consists only of software 
instruments and MIDI, you can change the sample rate at any time. But when 
audio is included in your project, changing the sample rate will require your 
audio to be converted to the new sample rate.
Logic Pro is capable of converting your audio to any sample rate, but this 
processing introduces the potential for degradation. Strive to capture clear 
recordings that need little processing. Beginning your project with the cor­
rect sample rate will help you achieve this goal.
If you must change the sample rate, downsampling (converting the sample 
rate from high to low) is preferable to upsampling. So start your projects with 
as high a sample rate as your hardware will allow or the project requires. The 
downsides of very high sample rates are larger file sizes and additional hard­
ware processing. Your computer can’t hold as many tracks or effects plug-ins 
on a project with a higher sample rate.
                           

82
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
To set your sample rate:
	
1.	Choose File➪Project Settings➪Audio.
	
	 The Project Settings window opens to the Audio pane, as shown in 
Figure 5-2.
	
2.	In the Sample Rate drop-down list, select the sample rate.
	
	 Logic Pro supports the following sample rates: 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, 
and 192 kHz.
	
	 CD audio uses a sample rate of 44.1 kHz and is ideal for most situations. 
For video production, 48 kHz is common. Higher sample rates are usu­
ally reserved for audiophile recordings, such as classical music and DVD 
audio. However, as hardware and processing power improves, higher 
sample rates may become more common.
Figure 5-2:

Determine your bit depth
Bit depth is the number of bits of information in each sample. A higher bit 
depth equals higher resolution for each sample. The default Logic Pro setting 
is 24-bit recording. If you turn off 24-bit recording, Logic Pro will record in 
16 bit. Similar to your sample rate, the only downsides of using a higher bit 
depth are that it takes up more drive space and uses more processing power.
To turn on or off 24-bit recording:
	
1.	Choose Logic Pro➪Preferences➪Audio.
	
	 The Preferences window opens to the Audio pane.
	
2.	Click the Devices tab, as shown in Figure 5-3.
                           

83
 Chapter 5: Introduction to Digital Audio and MIDI
	
3.	Select the Core Audio check box.
	
4.	In the middle of the screen, select or deselect the 24-Bit Recording 
option.
	
	 When 24-bit recording is not selected, Logic Pro records in 16 bit.
	
Figure 5-3: 
The Devices 
tab of Audio 
Preferences.
	
	
Bit depth is different than bit rate, which is the number of bits of information 
processed each second, as opposed to each sample. When exporting your 
project to lossy audio formats such as MP3, higher bit rates equal higher qual­
ity sound. You choose a bit rate when you export your audio in Chapter 19.
Choosing audio file types
When Logic Pro records audio, it creates an audio file on your hard drive. 
Different file types have different advantages. All recording file formats are 
lossless, so they have the same sound quality. The major difference in the 
recording file type is the recording duration.
                           

84
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
Logic Pro can record audio in the following file types:
	
✓	AIFF: 4 GB size limit. AIFF has a stereo-file time limit between 20 minutes 
and 3 hours and 15 minutes, depending on bit depth and sample rate. 
AIFF is the default Mac lossless audio file type. All Macs and most other 
operating systems can read AIFF files.
	
✓	WAVE: 4 GB size limit. WAVE has a stereo-file time limit between 40 min­
utes and 13 hours and 30 minutes, depending on bit depth and sample 
rate. This file type is the default audio file type in Windows operating 
systems. To be nice to a Windows user, it can’t hurt to use the WAVE 
file type. WAVE also has a longer recording duration, which gives it an 
advantage over AIFF.
	
✓	CAF: No size limit. CAF has a time limit of hundreds of years, if you can 
call that a limit. Apple loops and sound effects installed with Logic Pro 
use the CAF file type.
To choose the recording file type for your audio recordings, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Logic Pro➪Preferences➪Audio.
	
2.	Click the General tab.
	
3.	On the Recording File Type drop-down menu, make a selection, as 
shown in Figure 5-4.

 Chapter 5: Introduction to Digital Audio and MIDI
Connecting Your Audio Devices
If you plan on recording audio from a microphone or an instrument, you’ll 
need a way to get the audio into Logic Pro. Your Mac probably has a built-
in line in or microphone. Although these may work in a pinch, professional 
recordings need higher-quality input devices. The documentation of most 
professional hardware will show you how to set it up with Logic Pro.
Choosing your input and output device
After your hardware is set up and connected to your computer, you must 
select the hardware in Logic Pro Preferences. To choose your audio input and 
output devices:
	
1.	Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Audio.
	
2.	Click the Devices tab.
	
3.	On the Input Device and Output Device drop-down menus (refer to 
Figure 5-3), make your selections.
	
	 You can choose separate input and output devices. You may want 
to record a guitar by using a mobile guitar interface and monitoring 
through the computer speakers or headphones. In this case, you select 
the audio interface as the input and select Built-in Output as the output.
	
4.	Click the Apply Changes button.
	
	 Logic Pro will now begin using your selected input and output device 
for audio.
Setting your I/O buffer size 
and reducing latency
Latency refers to the delay between your audio input and audio output. This 
delay is unavoidable in software because your sound source must be con­
verted to digital audio and processed before it can be heard. In many cases, 
latency is negligible and won’t be noticeable. However, latency can become 
an issue when a track has lots of plug-ins that require significant processing.
	
It’s a good idea to record most of your tracks before you begin adding lots of 
plug-ins. The more plug-ins you add, the more processing power required, and 
the more latency you can introduce into the system. If you record without a 
lot of plug-ins, latency probably won’t be an issue.
                           

86
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
When you record, latency can be a hindrance if you can’t hear what you’re 
playing exactly when you’re playing it. Fortunately, you can adjust the latency 
as follows:
	
1.	Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Audio.
	
2.	Click the Devices tab.
	
3.	On the I/O Buffer Size drop-down menu (refer to Figure 5-3), make 
your selections.
	
	 Note that a smaller buffer size will reduce latency.
	
	 A smaller buffer size requires more processing power. If you set the 
buffer size too low, you can introduce clicks and pops in your audio. 
Experiment with the buffer size until you find a setting that minimizes 
latency but doesn’t introduce unwanted audio artifacts.
	
4.	Click the Apply Changes button.
	
	 Logic Pro will begin using your selected I/O buffer size.
Monitoring signals through your 
hardware or software
Some audio interfaces have built-in monitoring capabilities. This means you 
can listen to the source material you’re recording through your hardware 
instead of through the Logic Pro X software. Monitoring through your hard­
ware is useful if the software introduces too much latency.
By default, Logic Pro monitors audio through the software. To turn software 
monitoring off, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Audio.
	
2.	Click the Devices tab.
	
3.	Deselect the Software Monitoring check box (refer to Figure 5-3).
	
	 If no hardware is connected, the check box will appear dimmed and will 
be unavailable.
	
	 The Software Monitoring check box is available only if Show Advanced 
Tools is selected in the Advanced pane of Logic Pro X Preferences, as 
discussed in Chapter 1.
	
4.	Click the Apply Changes button.
	
	 Audio will no longer be monitored through Logic Pro.

 Chapter 5: Introduction to Digital Audio and MIDI
Exploring audio preferences
You’ve seen Logic Pro X audio preferences throughout this chapter. As you’ve 
discovered, you can customize the software to your audio needs in many 
ways. Next, I briefly cover some global audio preferences that will be of use 
as you record, edit, and mix your audio in Logic Pro.
Open the Audio Preferences window by choosing Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪
Audio. Here’s a brief description of the audio preferences:
	
✓	I/O Assignments tab: The I/O Assignments tab has three tabs: Output, 
Bounce Extensions, and Input, as shown in Figure 5-5. The Output tab 
enables you to send your audio to a different output pair if your hard­
ware supports it. Select the Mirroring check box to send your output 
through stereo out in addition to a second output.
	
Figure 5-5: 
The I/O 
Assignments 
tab in Audio 
Preferences.
	
	
✓	Audio File Editor tab: This tab, shown in Figure 5-6, let’s you set the 
preferences for the audio file editor. (For details on this editor, see 
Chapter 14.) The audio file editor has its own undo history with a defin­
able number of steps. You can also choose an external audio editor if 
you have one that you prefer.

Figure 5-6: 
The Audio 
File Editor 
tab in Audio 
Preferences.
	
	
✓	MP3 tab: The MP3 tab, shown in Figure 5-7, enables you to set the 
default bit rate of mono and stereo MP3 files. As discussed previously in 
this chapter, a higher bit rate will result in higher quality audio.
	
✓	Reset panel: If your software instruments get stuck and continuously 
play notes, you can reset them in this tab. Sometimes sustain messages 
from a sustain pedal get stuck, and notes continue playing as a result. 
You can reset sustain MIDI messages in addition to modulation and pitch 
bend in this tab, as shown in Figure 5-8.
	
In addition to global audio preferences, you can make changes to the project’s 
audio settings by choosing File➪Project Settings➪Audio (refer to Figure 5-2). 
These preferences usually work just fine in their default state. The only setting 
you’ll want to adjust when you begin your project is the sample rate, which 
you learned how to do previously in this chapter.

Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
Understanding MIDI
The MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) protocol enables compatible 
devices to send and receive data. It was created to allow hardware to speak 
to each other. Logic Pro uses the MIDI protocol to play and record software 
instruments, automation, and external MIDI hardware. In this next section, 
you find out how to use MIDI and to connect your MIDI devices to Logic Pro.
	
MIDI does not contain audio. Your external MIDI devices still need their audio to 
be routed into your computer and Logic Pro to be heard. Follow the instructions 
for connecting your audio devices as described previously in the “Connecting 
Your Audio Devices” section.
Sending MIDI messages
MIDI messages are sent from one device and received by another, such as 
from a MIDI controller to Logic Pro. These messages can include informa­
tion about pitch, velocity, sustain, and much more. Logic Pro translates 
the MIDI messages and sends them to a software instrument or to external 
hardware. (You create software instrument tracks and external MIDI tracks in 
Chapter 4.)
You’ll use MIDI to accomplish many of your musical goals in Logic Pro. As 
described in Chapter 3, you can even assign your MIDI controller to a Logic 
Pro command. It’s not difficult to map a button on your MIDI keyboard to tell 
Logic Pro to play your project. But while Logic Pro is always using MIDI under 
the hood, you’ll mostly be using MIDI to play software instruments.
To verify that Logic Pro is receiving the messages your MIDI controller is 
sending, show the MIDI activity in the LCD on your control bar as follows:
	
1.	Control-click an empty area on your control bar and choose Customize 
Control Bar and Display.
	
	 A window opens with customization options.
	
2.	In the LCD column, choose Custom.
	
3.	Select the MIDI Activity (In/Out) check box.
	
4.	Click the OK button.
	
	 Your LCD displays a small dot in the upper-right corner . If no MIDI is 
being received, the display will read No In/No Out.
                           

91
 Chapter 5: Introduction to Digital Audio and MIDI
Changing MIDI channels
MIDI devices send and receive information on 16 different channels. Many 
Logic Pro software instruments are multi-timbral, which means they can play 
multiple different sounds simultaneously. You can set these sounds to differ­
ent MIDI channels, which allows you to play them independently using mul­
tiple MIDI controllers. Or if you have a MIDI controller that has a split or layer 
function, you can potentially use a single keyboard to play multiple software 
instruments at a time. You find out how to set MIDI channels for MIDI record­
ing in Chapter 7.
Connecting Your MIDI Devices
MIDI devices can include keyboards, drum pads, alternative controllers such 
as guitar MIDI systems, and more. Although you don’t need a MIDI controller 
to make music with Logic Pro, it’s a lot more fun if you have a way to play 
software instruments. And trained players can make use of their skills to 
input music more quickly and accurately.
Connecting MIDI controllers
Many MIDI controllers will send and receive MIDI through USB, eliminating 
the need for a third-party interface. Older MIDI controllers may use 5-pin DIN 
cables and require a third-party hardware interface. Connect your controller 
to your MIDI interface or to your computer’s USB port.
Connecting external instruments
If you’re connecting a MIDI synthesizer or workstation to Logic Pro, in addi­
tion to making MIDI connections, you must be able to monitor the instru­
ment’s audio. If your audio interface supports hardware monitoring, you can 
monitor the instrument through your hardware. If it doesn’t, you’ll need to 
add an audio track to your project to monitor the instrument. For more on 
monitoring audio sources, see Chapter 6.
	
When you play the keyboard, the instrument is sending and receiving MIDI at 
the same time, so sounds are doubled. Most keyboards have a Local Off func­
tion, which you’ll want to use to stop the sound from doubling.

Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
Exploring MIDI preferences
Global and project preferences are similar to audio preferences. To open the 
Global MIDI Preferences pane, choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪MIDI. Here’s 
a brief description of three tabs in the MIDI Preferences pane:
	
✓	General: If you have MIDI communication problems, click the Reset All 
MIDI Drivers button.
	
✓	Reset Messages: If your MIDI controllers get stuck, including stuck notes, 
select the controller you want to reset on this tab.
	
✓	Sync: If you want to sync Logic Pro with another device or adjust the 
timing of your MIDI, you can do so on this tab.
To open the Project MIDI Preferences pane, choose File➪Project Settings➪MIDI. 
Here’s a brief description of the three tabs on the Project Preferences pane:
	
✓	General: You can set up MIDI to scrub with audio in the tracks area. 
Scrubbing means to audition audio while you drag your cursor over it.
	
✓	Input Filter: If you’re not using certain MIDI functions or don’t want 
these functions to be sent or received, you can select them on this tab 
and they will be filtered out.
	
✓	Chase: Use this tab to set how MIDI events will behave when you start 
your project after a MIDI event has been triggered. For example, if you 
play your project in the middle of a pitch bend, selecting the Pitch Bend 
check box will ensure that the bend is synchronized correctly.
	
You can use the Audio MIDI Setup utility to set up devices connected to your 
computer. (Audio MIDI Setup is in the Utilities folder of your Applications 
folder.) You can test MIDI and audio devices, set audio levels, and much 
more. For a video tour of the Audio MIDI Setup utility, visit http://logic
studiotraining.com/lpxfordummies.
Now that you know the fundamentals of digital audio and MIDI, you’re well on 
your way to recording your own audio and MIDI. With your hardware set up 
and your audio and MIDI preferences chosen, you’re ready to begin recording 
some great sounds.

A

udio recording was introduced to the original Notator Logic in 1994, 
about 20 years before the introduction of Logic Pro X. “The Sign” by 
Ace of Bass was the number-one song that year. While I can’t confirm that the 
song was referring to the emergence of computer audio recording, I can con­
firm that it was a breakthrough year for Logic.
Fast forward 20 years and you have a powerful and an affordable digital audio 
workstation that scores of major artists are using to create chart-topping 
hits. In this chapter, you discover how to record audio, build the perfect 
track from multiple recordings, and much more.
Preparing to Record Audio
In Chapter 5, you connect your audio hardware, set the project sample rate, 
and select the recording file type. You should confirm that the incoming 
signal from your audio source (microphone or instrument) is being received 
by your audio interface by checking the levels of your hardware inputs. 
(Check your audio interface documentation for details.)
Before you can begin recording, you need to create an audio track by choos­
ing Track➪New Audio Track. The new audio track is added to the track list 
and selected automatically.
	
Name your new track something descriptive because the audio files generated 
from recording will use the track name in the file name. To name your track, 
double-click the track header or press Shift-Enter and type your track name.
                           

94
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
On your new track, select the correct input as follows:
	
1.	Select the track.
	
2.	Open the track inspector by pressing I or by choosing View➪Show 
Inspector.
	
3.	Click the Input slot, as shown in Figure 6-1, and choose the correct 
input.
	
4.	Click the input format icon to toggle between stereo and mono input.

 Chapter 6: Recording Audio
Test your recording levels
To test the volume level at which you’ll record, enable the track for recording 
by clicking the record enable icon on the track header (refer to Figure 6-1) or 
by pressing Control-R. The record enable icon will blink red to let you know 
that the track is enabled for recording. Play your instrument or speak into 
your microphone to test the recording level. If your signal is too high or low, 
adjust the instrument volume or the input level on your audio interface.
	
Don’t clip the audio signal! When a signal is too loud and exceeds the limit that 
digital audio can reproduce, the signal is said to be clipping. You can see when 
your signal is clipping by the peak level display at the top of your track’s level 
meter, as shown in Figure 6-2. When the number above the level meter is posi­
tive, the peak level display will become red, indicating that the track is clip­
ping. During the recording phase, the best way to remedy signal clipping is to 
lower the volume on your instrument or audio interface. (Be sure to check for 
clipping on your audio interface as well.)
	
Figure 6-2: 
The track 
header.
	
	
You must have Show Advanced Tools selected in the Logic Pro X Advanced 
Tools Preferences pane. Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Advanced Tools 
and select Show Advanced Tools.
	
Pre-fader metering, which is used to test recording levels, means the level 
meter shows you the level of the signal before the fader. You can turn on pre-
fader metering by customizing your control bar, as described in Chapter 3, 
and selecting Pre Fader Metering in the Modes and Functions column. An icon 
is added to your control bar, as shown in Figure 6-3, to allow you to toggle 
pre-fader metering. You want your meters to show you the signal pre-fader so 
that you can be aware of what’s being recorded, even if you lower the fader to 
blend better with the other tracks. If you use post-fader metering, the meter 
will show you the level of the track after it has been raised or lowered, and 
you won’t know whether it’s clipping.

Enable software and input monitoring
If you’re not going to monitor your signal through your hardware, you’ll need 
to turn on software monitoring. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Audio.
	
	 The Audio Preferences window opens.
	
2.	Click the Devices tab.
	
3.	Select the Software Monitoring check box.
	
	 You can now use the Logic Pro software to monitor your audio. If you 
plan on monitoring the signal through your hardware, deselect Software 
Monitoring.
When a track is record enabled, you’ll be able to hear it. If a track isn’t record 
enabled, you won’t hear it unless you’ve turned on input monitoring.
If you’re monitoring from hardware and not software, you should turn off 
input monitoring. Turn it off and on by clicking the input monitoring icon on 
the track header (refer to Figure 6-2) or on the channel strip.
                           

97
 Chapter 6: Recording Audio
Setting up the metronome
By default, Logic Pro will play a metronome as you record. To turn off the 
metronome while recording, choose File➪Project Settings➪Metronome and 
select the Click While Recording check box, as shown in Figure 6-4. If you 
want to hear the metronome while you play the track, press K to toggle the 
metronome on and off.
Figure 6-4: 
The met-
ronome 
Project 
Settings.
The audio click you hear in the metronome is generated by the Klopfgeist 
software instrument. You can play it as instrument (though I don’t know why 
you’d want to). You can also set up an external sound source as your met­
ronome. In Figure 6-4, MIDI channel 10 is set to transmit a MIDI click. MIDI 
channel 10 is often reserved for drum sounds, so if you have a multi-timbral 
keyboard workstation, you can set a drum sound to MIDI channel 10 to 
receive the MIDI click.
If you have a drumbeat that grooves a little differently than the metronome, 
you may want it to hear the click only during the count-in and not while 
recording. To do so, select the Only During Count-In check box.
	
Be careful of metronome blindness, a condition where you don’t even realize 
that the metronome is playing because your brain has tuned it out. It’s hap­
pened to me and to others. The click can be heard over the entire mix but you 
forget that it’s on as you’re playing the track.
                           

98
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
If you want to adjust the number of bars that the metronome counts in before 
recording, choose File➪Project Settings➪Recording and select the number of 
bars or beats you want on the drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-5: 
The record-
ing Project 
Settings.
	
If you’re recording a slower song, select the Division check box to give your­
self more clicks to reference the time. And if you’re recording a drummer, 
you’ll be a recording session hero.
Recording Your First Audio Take
In the recording world, a single recording is called a take. Recording a good 
take is like capturing something special and elusive. Logic Pro helps you cap­
ture the moment quickly and easily.
With your track selected and record enabled, you can begin recording as 
follows:
	
1.	Place the playhead where you want to begin recording.
	
2.	Press R or click the record icon in the control bar transport, as shown 
in Figure 6-6.
	
3.	Wait for the count-in and then start playing.
                           

99
 Chapter 6: Recording Audio
	
4.	When you’re finished, click the stop icon on the transport or press the 
spacebar.
	
	 A new audio region will fill the area where you began and stopped 
recording, as shown in Figure 6-7.
Figure 6-6:

Figure 6-7: 
A recoded

To play back what you just recorded, place the playhead at the beginning of 
your newly recorded region and then click the play icon on the transport or 
press the spacebar. When you’re finished listening to your new recording, 
press the spacebar again and the project will stop playing.
Recording Multiple Takes in Cycle Mode
You can record additional recordings, or takes, on a track that already con­
tains audio regions. A take folder is created to contain the original and new 
takes. In cycle mode, new lanes are created each time the cycle passes.
                           

100
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
When cycle mode is enabled, playback or recording begins at the left locator 
and repeats when it reaches the right locator. To set up cycle mode, set the 
left and right locators by dragging from left to right in the upper half of the 
ruler in the tracks area. The cycle area will be displayed as a yellow strip in 
the upper half of the ruler, as shown in Figure 6-8. You can turn cycle mode 
on and off by pressing C or clicking the cycle icon in the control bar (refer to 
Figure 6-6).
	
Figure 6-8: 
Cycle mode.
	
To record in cycle mode, turn on cycle mode and begin recording as you did 
previously. After the second take is recorded, a take folder is created in the 
cycle area, as shown in Figure 6-9, and new lanes are added with each pass 
through the cycle. This is a great way to get several takes that you can edit 
into a perfect (or close to perfect) take. You learn how to edit your takes in 
Chapter 14.
Figure 6-9: 
An audio 
take folder.
A key to using cycle mode is setting locators. You can set locators in many 
ways. Here are a few useful locator commands:
	
✓	Choose Navigate➪Set Locators by Selection (⌘-U) to set the locators 
according to the regions you’ve selected.
	
✓	Choose Navigate➪Auto Set Locators➪Enable Auto Set Locators to auto­
matically follow your region selection or marquee tool selections.
                           

101
 Chapter 6: Recording Audio
	
✓	Set the locators manually in the control bar LCD if you have Locators 
(Left/Right) selected in the Customize Control Bar and Display options 
(see Chapter 3 for details).
	
Open the Key Commands window (Option-K) and type locators in the search 
bar. You’ll find dozens of key commands. After you browse the available loca­
tor key commands, you’ll have an idea of what you can do and how important 
locators are to a speedy workflow.
Recording Multiple Inputs
You aren’t limited to recording one track at a time. You can record multiple 
tracks by record-enabling several tracks at once and following the same steps 
as recording a single take. You can also create multiple takes on multiple 
tracks at once. Say that three times fast.
To record multiple tracks at once, set each track to the correct input, as you 
did previously. When all track inputs are set correctly, you can begin record­
ing. You can even record multiple takes on multiple inputs at the same time. 
The number of tracks you can record at one time depends on your hardware 
and computer power.
Punching In and Punching Out
Replacing just a portion of a track is called punch recording. You play the 
track, punch in and record the new part, and then punch out when you’re 
done. It’s like punching the work clock for a bar or two. Play, punch in, punch 
out, and play again.
The first way to set up punch recording is to do it on-the-fly, as the track is 
playing, as follows:
	
1.	Choose Record➪Allow Quick Punch-In.
	
	 This is the default setting.
	
2.	Choose Record➪Record Button Options➪Record/Record Toggle.
	
	 The settings of both the record icon and the record key command are 
updated so that clicking the record icon or using the key command 
toggles the record state on or off, while continuing to play.

3.	Press the spacebar to play your project.
	
4.	At the point where you want to begin recording (punch in), press R.
	
5.	At the point where you want to stop recording (punch out), press R 
again.
	
	 Your project continues playing but no longer records.
While your project is playing, you won’t be able to hear the input of the 
selected track until you begin recording. This setting is the default and is 
useful if you need to hear the recorded track to time the punch in. After you 
begin recording, you’ll be able to hear the input. But if you want to listen to 
the input during playback as well as during recording, turn off Auto Input 
Monitoring on the Record menu.
	
If you want to listen to the input of tracks that are not record-enabled, click 
the track’s input monitoring icon (refer to Figure 6-2).
When you need more precision in your punch recording, you can preprogram 
the punch in and punch out points. This technique is called autopunch record­
ing. To begin autopunch recording, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the autopunch icon in the control bar (refer to Figure 6-3).
	
	 If you don’t see the icon, customize the control bar. A second ruler is 
shown at the top of the tracks area, as shown in Figure 6-10.

Autopunch 
mode.
	
                           

103
 Chapter 6: Recording Audio
	
2.	Set the autopunch locators by dragging from left to right in the auto­
punch area of the ruler.
	
	 The autopunch area will be displayed by a red stripe (refer to 
Figure 6-10).
	
3.	Start recording before the punch-in point.
	
	 Recording begins automatically when the playhead reaches the left auto­
punch locator and ends when it reaches the right autopunch locator.
	
4.	Stop recording after the punch-in point.
	
	 A take folder is created, and a new lane is added that includes your auto­
punch recording.
Setting Up Multiple Monitor Mixes
In the recording world, the monitor mix is what the engineer hears from the 
speakers. It’s possible to create multiple monitor mixes if your hardware 
supports multiple outputs. Small nearfield monitors are the standard choice 
for getting a good sound. Sometimes, a large set of speakers is used to get a 
full giant sound that impresses the clients and, well, everyone else. A third 
set of small speakers or even a single mono speaker may be used to imitate 
cheaper sound systems, though you can use your built-in computer speakers 
for this job.
To set up additional monitor mixes, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Logic Pro➪Preferences➪Audio.
	
2.	Click the I/O Assignments tab and then click the Output tab.
	
3.	On the Output menu, choose the output pair you want to set up, as 
shown in Figure 6-11.
	
	 The outputs you have available depend on your hardware.
	
4.	Select Mirroring to mirror the stereo output to the selected output.
	
	 Your mix will now be played through the additional output pairs.

Giving your singer a separate 
vocal cue mix
If you’re recording by yourself and using a microphone, you need head­
phones so that any audio played back won’t leak into your recording. But as 
you add other people to the recording process, you might need to set up dif­
ferent headphone submixes for each person you record.
Giving a performer a separate headphone mix, known as a cue mix, can 
improve the precision and emotion of a performance. Vocalists need to hear 
different things than drummers need to hear. And if you want to get the best 
performance out of a performer, you need his or her recording process to be 
smooth and productive. That’s why you need to give performers their own 
mix, the way they want it.
                           

105
 Chapter 6: Recording Audio
	
Your hardware must have multiple outputs to route the submix to the correct 
output.
The process of setting up different submixes involves splitting the audio 
signal of a track and routing the parallel signal to an auxiliary track via the 
Send slot. (Refer to Figure 6-1 for the location of the Send slot.) To set up a 
submix:
	
1.	Click the Send slot on each track you want to send to the submix.
	
2.	On the Bus drop-down menu, choose an unused bus.
	
	 An auxiliary track is automatically added to the mixer. A bus is used to 
route audio to auxiliary tracks. To open the mixer and view the auxiliary 
track, press X.
	
3.	Click the Send slot again, and choose Pre Fader.
	
	 Setting the send to pre-fader allows you to adjust the volume of the track 
in the monitor mix using the track fader without changing the volume of 
the signal sent to the auxiliary track. If the send is set to post-fader, any 
adjustments you make to the volume of the track are also sent to the 
submix.
	
4.	Adjust the volume of the track in the submix by using the Send Level 
knob.
	
5.	Click the Output slot on the auxiliary track, and set it to the correct 
hardware output.
	
	 You can adjust the overall level of the submix by using the auxiliary 
track’s volume fader in the mixer.
Eight sends are available per channel strip, so you can send the track’s signal 
to eight different parallel submixes.
The recording techniques you discover in this chapter will put you well on 
your way to bringing your musical visions into reality. Recording in Logic Pro 
is straightforward but flexible enough to meet your needs. You have a power­
ful tool that will capture your music so you can share it with the world.

Recording MIDI
In This Chapter
▶	Setting up Logic Pro to record MIDI
▶	Recording external instrument and software instrument tracks
▶	Using musical typing and onscreen keyboards to record MIDI
▶	Overdubbing and recording multiple MIDI tracks
L

ogic Pro was created as a powerful MIDI sequencer. MIDI is the ultimate 
flexible recording medium, enabling you to change what you record until 
it’s perfect. It does have limitations, but it’s unlikely that you’ll notice them.
In this chapter, you find out how to record MIDI, filter MIDI events, multitrack 
MIDI recording, use musical typing, and much more.
Preparing to Record MIDI
MIDI is just data. Audio is not included in a MIDI region or a MIDI message. 
What you hear when a MIDI track plays is either the software instrument con­
nected to the track or the audio output from your external instruments. To 
begin recording MIDI, you’ll need to create either an external MIDI track or a 
software instrument track. Each type of track is explained in this section.
	
Show Advanced Tools must be selected in the Advanced Preferences pane. 
Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Advanced and then select Show Advanced 
Tools.
Recording external MIDI instruments
If you have an external MIDI instrument such as a keyboard workstation, you 
need to route the audio from the instrument into an audio track in your proj­
ect. To create an audio track, choose Track➪New Audio Track (Option-⌘-A). 
You should also turn on input monitoring, as explained in Chapter 6, so you 
can hear the input of your MIDI instrument.
                           

108
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
After you’ve verified that the audio is coming out of your instrument and into 
the audio track, you create and set up an external MIDI track as follows:
	
1.	Choose Track➪New External MIDI Track (or press Option-⌘-X).
	
	 A new external MIDI track is added to the track list and automatically 
selected.
	
2.	Open the inspector by pressing I or by choosing View➪Show Inspector.
	
	 The inspector shows you an external MIDI track channel strip, as shown 
in Figure 7-1. Note that the controls are different than those available 
with other types of tracks, and you can’t add effects or control the audio 
in your project. You can, however, control various MIDI functions on the 
external instrument.
	
3.	Display the track inspector by clicking the disclosure triangle above 
the channel strip, as shown in Figure 7-2.
	
	 The track inspector area opens allowing you to adjust the external MIDI 
track settings.

 Chapter 7: Recording MIDI
	
Figure 7-2:

inspector.
	
	
4.	Select the correct MIDI port and channel in the track inspector.
	
	 If you have multiple external MIDI instruments connected to a third-
party interface, you can choose different MIDI ports to control the 
instrument independently. Each MIDI port or MIDI instrument can trans­
mit and receive up to 16 different channels. This allows you to control 16 
different sounds on each MIDI instrument.
	
You need two tracks for external MIDI instruments: an audio track to moni­
tor the instrument and the external MIDI track to record the MIDI. For this 
reason, I record external MIDI instruments to audio as soon as possible. For 
starters, leaving tracks as MIDI invites indecision. You can tweak until the end 
of time, but if you want to be productive, you need to make decisions quickly. 
Also, because external gear and multiple tracks only complicate your proj­
ect, recording your external MIDI instruments as audio simplifies the project 
and guarantees that you’ll have the performance captured if a piece of gear 
changes or breaks later.
	
Most keyboard workstations have a local off function. You should turn on 
Local Off on your external MIDI instrument; otherwise, you’ll get doubled 
audio when both your hands and the MIDI data are playing the sounds on your 
keyboard.

Recording software instruments
To record a software instrument, you’ll need to create a new software instru­
ment track. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Track➪New Software Instrument Track (or press Option-⌘-S).
	
	 A new software instrument track is added to the track list and automati­
cally selected.
	
2.	Open the inspector by pressing I or by choosing View➪Show 
Inspector.
	
	 The inspector displays a software instrument track channel strip, as 
shown in Figure 7-3.

 Chapter 7: Recording MIDI
	
3.	Open the library by pressing Y or by choosing View➪Show Library.
	
	 The library menu opens to the left of the inspector.
	
4.	On the library menu, select the patch you want to use.
	
	 You can audition patches by selecting a patch and playing your MIDI 
controller.
	
5.	Display the track inspector by clicking the disclosure triangle above 
the channel strip (refer to Figure 7-3).
	
	 The track inspector area opens allowing you to adjust the software 
instrument track settings.
	
6.	Set the correct MIDI channel in the track inspector.
	
	 The default MIDI channel is set to All, which means your MIDI controller 
can be set to any MIDI channel and the software instrument track will 
receive the signal. If you want to set the track to receive from only a single 
MIDI channel, you need to set it to the correct MIDI channel in the track 
inspector. Using different MIDI channels is useful if you have more than 
one MIDI controller and you want them to control specific software instru­
ment tracks.
Recording with musical typing
What if you don’t have a keyboard controller handy? No problem. You can use 
musical typing to play your computer keyboard like a musical keyboard. Simply 
do the following:
	
1.	Choose Window➪Show Musical Typing or press ⌘-K.
	
	 The Musical Typing keyboard appears, as shown in Figure 7-4.
	
2.	Play the notes on the keyboard by pressing the corresponding keys.

112
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
You can do a lot with the musical typing keyboard. Here’s a description of the 
keys and what they do:
	
✓	You have access to almost an octave and a half by using the middle and 
top rows of alphabet keys.
	
✓	Sustain the notes you play by holding down the Tab key.
	
✓	Pitch bend down and up by using the 1 and 2 keys.
	
✓	Modulate the software instrument by pressing the 4 through 8 keys. 
Turn off modulation by pressing 3. The parameter that gets modulated 
will depend on the selected software instrument.
	
✓	Shift the keyboard octave down or up by pressing Z or X, respectively. 
To change the octave, drag the blue area in the keyboard at the top of 
the window (as shown in Figure 7-5).
	
✓	Adjust the velocity of the keyboard down or up by pressing C or V, 
respectively.
	
✓	Switch between the musical typing keyboard and the onscreen keyboard 
(shown in Figure 7-5) by clicking the keyboard icon in the upper-left 
corner of the interface.
Figure 7-5:

keyboard.
Recording with the step input keyboard
The step input keyboard allows you to enter notes one at a time. It’s great for 
non-keyboard players or keyboard players who need a little help inputting 
technical passages or those impossible to play with only two hands. The step 
input keyboard is also great for inputting scores from sheet music without 
having to learn how to play the part.
A MIDI region must be open in a MIDI editor to input notes with the step 
input keyboard. To use the step input keyboard, follow these steps:
	
1.	Double-click the MIDI region you want to edit.
	
	 The piano roll editor opens at the bottom of the tracks area.
                           

113
 Chapter 7: Recording MIDI
	
2.	Choose Window➪Show Step Input Keyboard (or press Option-⌘-K).
	
	 The step input keyboard appears, as shown in Figure 7-6.
	
3.	Place the playhead where you want to begin inputting notes.
	
4.	Click the note length and note velocity icons, and then click the key 
you want to input.
	
	 A MIDI note event is added to the piano roll editor at the playhead 
position.
Figure 7-6: 
The step 
input 
keyboard.
The step input keyboard has the following advanced features:
	
✓	To input notes sequentially on the same beat, select the chord icon on 
the left side of the step input keyboard.
	
✓	To make the first note you click a length and a half of the currently 
selected note length, select the dot icon. The second note you click will 
be half the length of the currently selected note length.
	
✓	To make the next three notes you play part of a triplet, select the triplet 
icon.
	
✓	Select the sustain icon to lengthen the selected note in the editor by the 
length selected in the Step Input Keyboard.
	
✓	To snap the next note you input to the nearest division on the grid, 
select the quantize icon.
	
✓	To define the MIDI channel of the next selected note, choose a value in 
the MIDI channel drop-down menu.
	
The step input keyboard uses traditional notation for velocity values: ppp (16) 
pp (32), p (48), mp (64), mf (80), f (96), ff (112), and fff (127).

Recording Your First MIDI Take
Recording a MIDI take is similar to recording an audio take. Just do the 
following:
	
1.	Select the track, and then record-enable it by clicking the record 
enable icon on the track header or by pressing Control-R.
	
	 The record enable icon will blink red to let you know that the track is 
enabled for recording.
	
2.	Place the playhead where you want to begin recording.
	
3.	Press R or click the record icon on the transport in the control bar.
	
	 Refer to Chapter 3 for control bar and transport details.
	
4.	Wait for the count-in and then start playing.
	
5.	When you’re finished, press the spacebar or click the stop icon on the 
transport.
	
	 A new MIDI region will fill the area where you began and stopped 
recording, as shown in Figure 7-7.
Figure 7-7: 
A recorded 
MIDI region.
	
You can adjust the recording count-in by choosing File➪Project Settings➪
Recording➪Count-In.
	
As you record a MIDI track, your controller could be sending a lot more data 
than note on and note off messages. You could be sending aftertouch data, 
system exclusive data, or other control changes. If you don’t need these 
types of MIDI data in your project, you can filter them. Choose File➪Project 
Settings➪MIDI, click the Input Filter tab, and then select the MIDI data you 
want to filter (see Figure 7-8). Recording all MIDI data isn’t a big deal, but if you 
need to do MIDI editing in the list editor (described in Chapter 15), having less 
data makes it easier.

Recording Multiple MIDI 
Takes in Cycle Mode
As with audio takes, you can record multiple MIDI takes to build a perfect 
take. Building a final composite take from multiple takes is called comping. 
To create a take folder when recording in cycle mode, you must first choose 
Record➪MIDI Recording Options➪Create Take Folders. The MIDI recording 
options will set how your project behaves when you create overlapping MIDI 
regions.
	
You can get to the MIDI recording options also by choosing File➪Project 
Settings➪Recording. Then select how your project handles overlapping MIDI 
regions on the drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 7-9. For a detailed look 
at all overlapping recording options, see the video guide I provided for you at 
http://logicstudiotraining.com/lpxfordummies.
To record MIDI takes in cycle mode, follow these steps:
	
1.	In the cycle ruler at the top of the tracks area, drag from left to right 
to set the cycle locators.
	
	 Cycle mode is automatically turned on and represented by a yellow strip 
in the ruler.

2.	Press R to begin recording.
	
	 After the second take is recorded, a take folder is created, as shown in 
Figure 7-10, and new lanes are added with each pass through the cycle. 
All previous takes are muted so you hear only the current take.
	
3.	Press the spacebar to end recording.
	
4.	Click the disclosure triangle in the upper-left corner of the take folder.
	
	 The take folder will open and display all the takes, as shown to the right 
in Figure 7-10. You can open the take folder also by double-clicking it or 
by selecting it and pressing Control-F.

 Chapter 7: Recording MIDI
Creating Tracks in Cycle Mode
You might want to record a beat or groove and build it one take at a time. 
Recording this way makes it easier to focus on a single element rather than 
playing a full part. Logic Pro gives you several options when you record in 
cycle mode:
	
✓	Record➪MIDI Recording Options➪Create Tracks when Cycling creates a 
new take track with each pass. A take track uses the same channel strip 
as the original track, so it doesn’t use up more resources. For example, 
if you’re recording MIDI drums and want each drum sound on a different 
track, you can create new tracks in cycle mode until you have a complete 
beat. You can use the same technique with a multi-instrument (a single 
software instrument with more than one sound) and create an entire 
groove from the ground up. Recording this way is like using a looper, with 
each loop building on the first, except it continues to add layers until you 
stop recording.
	
✓	Record➪MIDI Recording Options➪Create Tracks and Mute When Cycling 
mutes the previous track after each pass. Use this if you don’t want to 
build on the previous take but do want to create take alternatives. This 
method is similar to take recording, but it creates new take tracks instead 
of creating a take folder. Logic Pro lets you accomplish similar goals in 
several ways. In many cases, there’s no right way to do something — just 
the way that lets you get the job done.
Overdubbing MIDI
You may need to add a part to an existing region. Building drum grooves is 
a perfect example. You might want to join the new recording to the already 
existing region. In this case, choose Record➪MIDI Recording Options➪Join 
with Selected Regions. Everything you record on top of a current region will 
be joined with it, as long as it’s selected before you begin recording.
If you want a similar recording behavior while recording in cycle mode, choose 
Record➪MIDI Recording Options➪Join When Cycling. Now all regions will be 
joined after each pass.
Recording Multiple MIDI Inputs
You can record more than one MIDI track at a time. Record-enable each track 
that you want to record and then record as usual. Anything you play will be 
recorded on all record-enabled tracks.
                           

118
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
If you want to use two or more controllers to perform different parts on dif­
ferent software instruments, you’ll need to set the tracks and controllers to 
separate MIDI channels in the track inspector, as described previously in the 
“Preparing to Record MIDI” section.
	
I’ve saved the best tip for last. Imagine that you’re playing your project and it’s 
sounding good. You’re feeling the vibe, so you reach over to your keyboard and 
improvise a sick riff. “Oh, that was nice! I wish I had recorded that,” you think 
to yourself as you gaze beyond the cold heartless computer, disappointed. 
Stop feeling blue. I have great news: You were recording the entire time! You 
can capture that recording retroactively:
	
✓	Press Shift-R to capture the most recent MIDI performance. Depending 
on your current MIDI recording options, your most recent performance 
is captured as a region, take, or take track on the selected track.
	
✓	You can add the capture recording icon to the control bar. For details on 
customizing the control bar, see Chapter 3.
	
✓	Capture recording works only on MIDI tracks. You can’t retroactively 
capture audio recordings.
As you can see, your creative power is limited only by your imagination. And 
your imagination is fueled by the possibilities Logic Pro gives you. You have a 
professional recording studio that can handle any project you can envision.

W

hat if you don’t play an instrument or sing? Are you destined to stare 
at an empty project? No way. Apple loops and prerecorded media 
come to the rescue.
Logic Pro X comes with an enormous amount of media that you can add to 
your project. You can build an entire song with nothing but this media. In this 
chapter, you learn how to use Apple loops, import audio and video files, and 
much more.
Adding Apple Loops to Your Project
Apple loops are audio and MIDI files that contain additional metadata, such as 
the key signature, time signature, and tempo. Logic Pro reads this metadata 
and adjusts the Apple loop to your project settings. For example, if you take 
an Apple loop in the key of G at 120 beats per minute and put it into a proj­
ect in the key of E at 100 beats per minute, the Apple loop will automatically 
adjust to the project tempo and key. Apple loops are flexible. They do a lot of 
yoga when you’re not using them. It would be a shame for all that stretching 
to go to waste, so please use Apple loops.
Apple loops can be beats, instrument parts, sound effects, or anything that 
you want to repeat. You can build an entire project with only Apple loops, or 
you can use them as accents to live instruments. As limber as they are with 
time and key signatures, they’re equally able to fit into your project needs.

Navigating the loop browser
Logic Pro X gives you a special loop browser to search and find Apple loops, 
as shown in Figure 8-1. To open the loop browser, choose View➪Show Apple 
Loops or press O. You can also open the loop browser by clicking the loop 
browser icon in the control bar. If you don’t see the loop browser icon, you 
can customize the control bar as described in Chapter 3.
	
Figure 8-1: 
The Apple

browser.
	
Here’s a description of the loop browser and its functions:
	
✓	Loops index drop-down menu: At the top of the loop browser is a drop-
down menu where you can select different loop collections installed on 
your computer. To view only loops that you’ve created, choose the My 
Loops category. At the bottom of the menu, you can choose Reindex All 
Loops to rebuild the catalog. You may want to reindex your loops after 
you’ve added loops to your system.
	
✓	Search bar: You can search for loops by name with the search bar.
	
✓	View icons: Below the search bar are two view icons that let you switch 
between button view and column view. The button view is the default 
state that shows you clickable keyword buttons to refine your loop 
search. The column view lets you navigate through loops by category.

 Chapter 8: Adding Media to Your Project
	
✓	Scale menu: You can filter your search by scale type, including Major, 
Minor, Neither, or Good for Both.
	
✓	Signature menu: You can filter your search by time signature.
	
✓	Keyword buttons: While in button view, you can click multiple keyword 
buttons to filter the search results. The top-left button is the Reset 
button, which clears all button choices. To the right of the Reset button 
is the Favorites button, which filters the search results to any loop that 
has been selected as a favorite.
	
✓	Category columns: While in column view, you filter the search results by 
navigating through categories of loops.
	
✓	Results list: This area displays the Apple loops. It has six columns: 
loop type, loop name, beats, favorites, tempo, and key. Loop types are 
divided into blue audio Apple loops and green MIDI Apple loops.
	
✓	Volume slider: Selecting a loop automatically plays it. The volume slider 
adjusts the loudness of the loop as you audition it.
	
✓	Play In menu: You can select the auditioned loop to play in the Song 
Key (the key of the current project), the Original Key (the key of the 
Apple loop), or a specific key.
	
✓	Count: The number of loops that fit your search criteria is displayed at 
the bottom right of the loop browser.
Adding audio loops
Audio loops are audio files and can be added to audio tracks. In the loop 
browser, you can spot an audio Apple loop by its blue icon containing a wave­
form. You can edit audio Apple loops just as you can a recorded audio region. 
To add an audio Apple loop to your project, do one of the following:
	
✓	Drag an audio Apple loop from the loop browser to an empty area of the 
tracks area or track list, as shown in Figure 8-2. An audio track will be 
created and the loop will be added to a region on the track.
	
✓	Drag an audio Apple loop from the loop browser to an existing audio 
track. The Apple loop will be added to the tracks area at the position 
where you drop the loop.
	
You can’t drag an Apple loop to a software instrument track or an external 
MIDI track from the loop browser. Logic Pro is thoughtful enough to warn you 
if you try. After the loop is in the tracks area, however, you can drag an Apple 
loop region to a software instrument track or an external MIDI track but it will 
not play. So if you drag an Apple loop into your project and it’s not playing, 
make sure it’s on the right type of track.

loops to the 
tracks area.
	
If you stretch an audio Apple Loop too far from its original key or tempo, your 
loop may end up with a pulled muscle. An audio Apple loop doesn’t always 
sound good when it’s stretched too far, but it still makes a great placeholder 
until you can replace it.
Adding MIDI loops
MIDI loops can be added to software instrument tracks or external MIDI 
tracks. You can identify MIDI Apple loops by their green icon in the loop 
browser. To add MIDI Apple loops to your project, do one of the following:
	
✓	Drag a MIDI loop to an external MIDI track. A MIDI region is created on 
the track with the Apple loop contents.
	
✓	Drag a MIDI loop to a software instrument track or to an empty area of 
the tracks area or track list. A software instrument track is created, the 
corresponding software instrument is added to the track, and the loop is 
added to a MIDI region on the track.
	
If you drag a MIDI Apple loop to an audio track, the loop will be converted to 
audio and added to the tracks area at the position where you drop the loop.
You can also create your own Apple loops from any audio or MIDI region in 
your project. To create your own Apple loops, Control-click any region and 
choose Export➪Add to Loop Library (Shift-Control-O). The Add Region to 
Apple Loops Library window appears, as shown in Figure 8-3.
                           

123
 Chapter 8: Adding Media to Your Project
	
Figure 8-3: 
The Add 
Region to 
Apple Loops 
Library 
window.
	
You can create the following:
	
✓	Loop: A loop will follow the project tempo. Loops are great for regions 
you want to repeat again and again.
	
✓	One-shot: A one-shot will not follow the tempo and will play until the 
region completes. One-shots are great for sound effects or sounds that 
don’t have rhythmic content.
You can also choose the scale, genre, and instrument descriptors. Click the 
Create button and your Apple loop will be added to the loop browser.
Adding Prerecorded Audio 
to Your Project
If you have audio files on your hard drive that you want to bring into your 
project, Logic Pro makes the process a breeze. In most cases, adding audio 
files to your project is a simple drag-and-drop process from Finder or from 
one of the Logic Pro browsers to an empty audio track.
                           

124
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
Using the browsers to find audio files
To open the Logic Pro browsers, choose View➪Show Browsers or press F. 
The browsers open to the right of the tracks area, as shown in Figure 8-4.
	
Figure 8-4: 
The proj-
ect audio 
browser.
	
Logic Pro gives you three browsers for adding media to your project:
	
✓	Project audio browser: Add or remove files that are already in your 
project.
	
✓	Media browser: Import audio and video into your project from the 
­system-wide media browser. You can also import GarageBand projects 
from the media browser.
	
✓	All files browser: Import files from anywhere on your hard drive as 
well as import settings from other Logic Pro projects. (For details, see 
Chapter 2.)
	
Show Advanced Tools must be enabled to view the project audio browser and 
all files browser. Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Advanced Tools, and 
select Show Advanced Tools.

 Chapter 8: Adding Media to Your Project
Adding audio to your project
All the audio you record or import into your project will show up in the proj­
ect audio browser. Click the Project tab in the browser window to see all the 
audio that’s been collected in your project (refer to Figure 8-4).
At the top of the project audio browser are three menus:
	
✓	Audio File: Add audio files from anywhere on your computer. You can 
delete, back up, and move files. You can also convert audio files to dif­
ferent formats or convert selected regions to independent audio files on 
this menu.
	
✓	Edit: Cut, copy, paste, and delete audio files. You can also select all, 
used, or unused files on this menu. The project browser has its own 
undo history, which you can access on this menu.
	
✓	View: Sort, show, hide, or group your audio files in the browser.
The file list has the following four columns:
	
✓	Name: Displays the file name with a disclosure triangle next to it. Click 
the disclosure triangle to display all the regions that use the audio file. 
Clicking a region will select the region in the tracks area. You can double-
click the file and region name to rename them.
	
✓	Icon: Displays icons that tell you whether the file or region is time-
stamped, follows the project tempo, contains tempo information, or is 
missing.
	
✓	Info: Displays sample rate, bit depth, input format, and file size. It also 
displays a waveform with an anchor icon. You can drag the icon to edit 
the absolute start time of the region. Click the center of the waveform to 
audition the audio file.
	
✓	bpm: Displays the tempo of the audio file if the file contains tempo 
information.
You can audition these files by clicking the play icon at the bottom left of the 
browser. Click the play icon again to stop. Click the loop icon to repeat the 
audio file after you click the play icon. A volume slider adjusts the volume of 
the audio file you’re auditioning.
You can drag the audio files and regions to existing audio tracks or to an 
empty area in the tracks area or track list, where a track will be created to 
contain the region.
                           

126
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
Adding audio from the media browser
The second tab in the Browser window is the media browser. The media 
browser displays media created by other Mac applications such as iMovie, 
GarageBand, iTunes, or Logic Pro. If you want to import content from your 
iTunes library, which I do all the time to add reference tracks to my project, 
use the media browser.
At the top of the media browser are the following two tabs:
	
✓	Audio: Import songs from your iTunes library and GarageBand projects.
	
✓	Movies: Import movies from your Movies folder, iMovie projects, and 
Final Cut Pro projects.
Below the tabs are the media libraries available on your computer. Selecting 
a library updates the results list at the bottom of the browser, as shown in 
Figure 8-5. At the bottom of the window are a play icon and a search field to 
find and audition your media.
	
Figure 8-5: 
The media 
browser.
	
To add media from the media browser, drag the media to an existing audio 
track or to an empty area in the tracks area or track list, where a track will be 
created to contain the region.
                           

127
 Chapter 8: Adding Media to Your Project
Adding audio from the all files browser
The third tab in the browser window is the all files browser. If you want to 
add audio, MIDI, or movies from your computer, you would do it from this 
browser, as shown in Figure 8-6. The all files browser is like the Finder app.
	
Figure 8-6: 
The all files 
browser.
	
Here’s a description of the elements in the all files browser:
	
✓	Back and forward icons: Use these icons to navigate backward or for­
ward, respectively, in your browsing history.
	
✓	Computer, home, and projects icons: These three icons will take you 
to your Macintosh HD, user home directory, or Logic Pro projects direc­
tory, respectively.
	
✓	List and column view icons: These icons display your files in list view 
or column view, respectively.
	
✓	File path selector: The file path is displayed in this area and is clickable 
so that you can navigate up the file hierarchy.
	
✓	Search field: Use the search field to find files in your current folder. 
The plus icon to the right of the search field allows you to add up to 10 
search filters.
	
✓	Results list: Your current search results are displayed in this area. You 
can sort the three columns — Name, Date, and Size — by clicking the 
column headers.
                           

128
Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
	
✓	Action menu: The gear icon has some actions that you can apply to the 
currently selected item in the results list. You can add audio files to the 
project audio browser, find the selected file in Finder, create new files, 
and convert ReCycle files to Apple loops. Depending on the file type 
selected, you can also audition the audio.
After you’ve located the file you want to add to your project, you can drag it 
into the project just like the other browsers. You can also import project set­
tings from the all files browser, as described in Chapter 2.
Importing Video to Your Project
Logic Pro X isn’t just an audio/MIDI sequencer. You can also import video and 
add your own movie score. Film and TV scoring with Logic Pro X is intuitive, 
and you’ll find that adding movies to your project is simple.
Adding a movie to your project
As you discovered previously in the chapter, you can add QuickTime movies 
to your project by using any of the media browsers. You can also add a movie 
by choosing File➪Movie➪Open Movie (Option-⌘-O). Navigate to the movie 
file in the dialog that appears and click Open. The Open Movie dialog asks 
you to open the movie; if the movie contains an audio track, you can extract 
the audio track into your project, as shown in Figure 8-7. Click OK and the 
movie is added to your project and the audio is added to the track list.
	
Figure 8-7: 
The Open 
Movie 
dialog.
	
Display the inspector, and the movie appears at the top of the inspector, as 
shown in Figure 8-8. You can double-click the movie to open the video in a 
separate window.

Exploring the movie track
After you add a movie to your project, you can display the movie track. 
Choose Track➪Global Track➪Show Global Tracks, and the global tracks open 
above the tracks area. (If the movie track isn’t visible, choose Track➪Global 
Track➪Configure Global Tracks, select the Movie check box, and click Done.) 
The movie track displays thumbnails of the video and is adjustable by drag­
ging the bottom edge of the movie track, as shown in Figure 8-9.

Part II: Digital Recording and Using Prerecorded Media 
Creating movie scene markers
You can create movie scene markers that are locked to absolute time instead 
of relative time. This means they won’t move if you change the tempo of your 
project. Movie scene markers are great for timing your music to the rhythm of 
the scene. To create movie scene markers, choose Navigate➪Other➪Create 
Movie Scene Markers and select one of the following options:
	
✓	Auto Range: Create markers based on the marquee selection, project 
cycle, selected regions, or all three.
	
✓	Marquee Selection: Create markers based on the marquee selection.
	
✓	Cycle Area: Create markers based on the cycle area.
	
✓	Selected Regions: Create markers based on the selected regions.
	
✓	Entire Movie: Create markers based on the entire movie.
After you select the option for creating movie scene markers, the movie will 
be analyzed and markers will be created, as shown in Figure 8-10. Markers 
are created based on a fixed threshold for scene cuts and work well for most 
types of video.
Figure 8-10: 
Movie 
scene 
markers.
Importing audio from your movie
If you’ve already imported a movie but not the audio, or if you want to import 
audio from a movie without importing the movie, choose File➪Movie➪Import 
Audio from Movie. The audio will be added to a track in the track list. 
Importing audio is useful if you need to build a soundtrack around dialog or 
sound effects.
As you’ve learned in this chapter, you don’t need to play an instrument to 
benefit from Logic Pro. You discovered how to import movies so you can 
compose your own soundtracks. You also found out how to navigate the 
Logic Pro browsers so you can build a project from prerecorded media. As 
you can see, Logic Pro can support professional demands, which is why so 
many musicians rely on it to get great results.

Chapter 9
Making Beats with Drummer 
and Ultrabeat
In This Chapter
▶	Creating beats with your virtual drummer
▶	Producing drum sounds
▶	Designing grooves with Ultrabeat
▶	Sequencing drum patterns
D

id your drummer get lost on the way to the studio? Don’t you just hate 
it when that happens? Oh, you have Logic Pro X? Never mind.
Listen, I love playing with a live drummer. Some of my best musical partner­
ships have been with amazing drummers. But I’ve kept my greatest rhythm 
relationships private because I haven’t wanted to hurt any of my drummers’ 
feelings. Because I’m putting my own feelings in print, I might as well go all in. 
I love Drummer and Ultrabeat. There, I said it.
In this chapter, you discover how to use the new virtual drummer and 
Ultrabeat, the groove machine. You create beats, build custom drum kits, and 
use a pattern sequencer. Drummer and Ultrabeat make Logic Pro X an amaz­
ing songwriting tool and a music-producing powerhouse. But whatever you 
do, don’t beat on your computer. It only sounds like a drum — it’s not built 
like one.
Playing with Your Virtual Drummer
New to Logic Pro X is Drummer, your virtual session player. Drummer is a 
combination of a new track type and new software instrument. The track type 
does the drumming and the software instrument provides the drum sounds. 
As described in Chapter 4, a drummer track is a special MIDI track that looks 
like audio in the tracks area.
                           

134
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
The drummer track comes with its own drummer editor, which chooses the 
style of music and the player, and tells the drummer how to play the track. 
The editor is so simple that even a drummer could use it. Okay, no more pot­
shots at drummers. Promise. I love Drummer so much because I wish I could 
play the drums. Honest.
The Drum Kit Designer software instrument is added to a drummer track 
automatically, but you don’t have to use the Drum Kit Designer. But Drummer 
and Drum Kit Designer were made for each other, so I won’t separate them in 
this chapter.
Creating a drummer track
To create a drummer track, choose Track➪New Drummer Track. A new drum­
mer track is added to the track list, and two default eight-bar regions are 
added to the tracks area, as shown in Figure 9-1.
	
Figure 9-1: 
A drummer 
track and 
regions.
	
	
You can have only one drummer track in a project. You can convert a drum­
mer track into a MIDI track and then add another drummer track, but you 
lose the ability to use the drummer editor and will have to edit the drum part 
manually. You learn more about converting your drummer track to MIDI later 
in this section. By the way, Drummer prevents you from creating “impossible” 
beats, where you might accidentally program something a real drummer 
simply couldn’t play.
                           

135
 Chapter 9: Making Beats with Drummer and Ultrabeat
Creating drummer regions
Drummer automatically creates two eight-bar regions, but you don’t have to 
live with them. By using several regions to build your project rather than one 
big region, you can more easily change what your drummer plays during dif­
ferent song sections (as you’ll soon see).
To create a drummer region, select the pencil tool in the tracks area and click 
where you would like the region to begin. By default, drummer regions are 
eight bars long. If you want to change the size of the region, drag the lower-
left or lower-right edge of the region to resize it. You could also split a region 
(making two regions out of one) by using the scissors tool.
	
If you want to force the drummer to hit the crash cymbal at the beginning of a 
song section, create a new region. You may need to adjust the Fills parameter, 
as you learn next, but getting Drummer to play a cymbal crash at the begin­
ning of a region is a good reason why you want new regions to start at song 
sections or groove changes.
Choosing and directing your 
drummer in the editor
The real power of Drummer’s artificial intelligence–like personality is in the 
drummer editor. To open the editor, double-click a drummer region or choose 
View➪Show Editor (E). The editor opens at the bottom of the tracks area, as 
shown in Figure 9-2.
Figure 9-2: 
The  
drummer 
editor.
The drummer editor is filled with personality. The left side of the drummer editor 
is where you change settings for the entire drummer track. At the top of the area 
is a style button. Click the button and a drop-down menu appears so you can 
choose between Rock, Alternative, Songwriter, and R&B. Each style has several 
                           

136
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
different drummers with names and headshots, as shown in Figure 9-3. The cur­
rent drummer’s name is yellow in the headshot. Click the drummer you want 
for the entire track. The track regions and drummer editor are updated with the 
style of the selected drummer. Since Logic Pro X first came out, developers have 
added new drummers and kits, and more are bound to be on the way.
	
Figure 9-3: 
The 
drummer 
chooser.
	
The right side of the drummer editor is where you change settings for the 
selected region. Here’s a description of each section:
	
✓	Ruler: At the top of the region settings are a ruler and a play icon. You 
can play the region or move the playhead within the region in this ruler.
	
✓	Presets: Each drummer comes with a set of presets that you can click 
to update the editor controls. At the top of the Presets menu is a drop-
down list where you can save, delete, and recall the default preset. You 
can also refresh the region to make subtle changes to the current region. 
Finally, you can choose to keep the settings while changing drummers.
	
✓	X/Y pad: The X/Y pad has a yellow puck that you can move between 
Loud/Soft and Complex/Simple. The position of the puck makes a big dif­
ference in the beat the drummer will play.
	
✓	Drum kit: Click the drum group to select the drums that will play in the 
region. You can also choose to add one of three percussion instruments. 
The sliders to the right of the drum kit allow you to choose between 
                           

137
 Chapter 9: Making Beats with Drummer and Ultrabeat
variations of the groove. If you select the Follow check box for the Kick 
and Snare slider, the slider changes to a drop-down menu and you can 
select a track in the project that the kick and snare will follow.
	
✓	Fills: The Fills knob, shown in Figure 9-4, adjusts the number and length of 
fills. Click the lock icon to freeze the fills setting when changing presets.
	
✓	Swing: The Swing knob adjusts the amount of shuffle feel. Click the lock 
icon to freeze the swing setting when changing presets. You can also 
click the 8th or 16th buttons to decide whether the swing is based on 
eighth notes or sixteenth notes.
	
✓	Details: Click the Details button to open an additional editing panel, as 
shown in Figure 9-4. Use this panel to change Feel, Ghost Notes, and Hi-Hat 
performance. The Feel knob adjusts how Drummer plays relative to the 
tempo. You can pull back the performance so that it plays behind the beat 
or push it forward so it plays in front of the beat. The Ghost Notes knob 
adjusts how loudly or quietly Drummer plays ghost notes (notes that are 
played at a low volume between the loud notes). The Hi-Hat knob adjusts 
the amount of closed or open hi-hat that Drummer plays. The panel has a 
lot of personality, so don’t forget to make use of it.

Selecting producer kits
Each drummer has a default kit connected to the drummer. The kit is automati­
cally loaded into the stereo Drum Kit Designer software instrument. You can 
upgrade the kit to a special producer kit that has more tracks and channel 
strips for ultimate control. To select a producer kit, simply do the following:
	
1.	Choose View➪Show Library to open the library.
	
	 The library opens on the left side of the tracks area.
                           

138

2.	Choose Drum Kit➪Producer Kits, and then select a patch.
	
	 The track is upgraded to a track stack containing several tracks of indi­
vidual drums.
	
To have access to all producer kits, choose Logic Pro X➪Download Additional 
Content. The Additional Content window opens, as shown in Figure 9-5. Select 
the Drum Kit check box and click Install. Be mindful of size. The multi-output 
drum kits are 9.1 gigabytes, but these kits were engineered by golden-eared 
professionals and are worth every gigabyte.

Click any drum to play it. As you click a drum, the left side displays the 
Exchange panel where you can choose different drums. The right side dis­
plays the Edit panel where you can control the selected drum sound, as 
shown in Figure 9-7.
Each type of drum or cymbal has different parameters. You can tune and 
dampen every sound, and you can adjust the volume by using the gain knob. 
If you’ve loaded a producer kit (refer to the previous section, “Selecting 
producer kits”), you can select whether the sound should be included in 
the overheads and room microphones or should leak into other drum mics. 
For the room mics, you can select between two mic setups by using the A/B 
slider.
At the bottom of the software instrument screen is a disclosure triangle that 
opens the additional settings shown in Figure 9-8. In this area, you can adjust 
the volume of the drummer’s percussion instruments.

 Chapter 9: Making Beats with Drummer and Ultrabeat
Converting drummer regions 
to MIDI regions
If you need absolute control over a drummer region, you can convert it to 
a MIDI region. Two methods are available for converting a drummer region 
to MIDI:
	
✓	Drag any drummer region to MIDI track. The region will automatically 
convert to a MIDI region.
	
✓	⌘-click a drummer region and choose Convert➪Convert to MIDI Region. 
The region will convert to MIDI, and the drummer editor will no longer 
be available.
	
You can convert a MIDI region on a drummer track back to a drummer region 
by ⌘-clicking the region and choosing Convert➪Convert to Drummer Region. 
However, any edits you made to the MIDI region will not be saved after the 
conversion.
Creating Beats with Ultrabeat
Ultrabeat is a 25-voice drum synth and pattern sequencer that operates simi­
larly to a traditional hardware drum machine. Drum voices 1–24 are assigned 
to the first 24 MIDI keys (C1 to B2), and the 25th drum voice is assigned to 
the 25th MIDI key and above (beginning at C3), so it can be played chromati­
cally, making it ideal for bass sounds, pads, or leads.
Ultrabeat is capable of doing a lot more than drumbeats and bass lines. Each 
of the 25 voices is a complete synth and gives you flexible control over each 
voice. In this section, you discover how to design drum sounds and patterns 
and incorporate Ultrabeat into your projects.
Exploring the Ultrabeat interface
To open Ultrabeat, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Track➪Create New Software Instrument Track.
	
	 A new software instrument track is added to the track list.
	
2.	Choose View➪Show Inspector (I) to display the inspector.
	
	 The inspector opens on the left side of the tracks area.
                           

142
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
	
3.	Click the right side of the instrument slot and then select Ultrabeat 
(Drum Synth).
	
	 The Ultrabeat interface opens in a new window, as shown in Figure 9-9.
Figure 9-9: 
The 
Ultrabeat 
interface.
The Ultrabeat interface is divided into three sections:
	
✓	Assignment: The left side of Ultrabeat is where you, select, mix, and 
assign drum sounds.
	
✓	Synthesizer: The largest area of Ultrabeat is where you design the cur­
rently selected drum sound.
	
✓	Step Sequencer: The bottom section of Ultrabeat is where you create 
drum patterns for the currently selected drum and control the Ultrabeat 
sequencer.
                           

143
 Chapter 9: Making Beats with Drummer and Ultrabeat
At the top of the Ultrabeat interface is a menu with several functions:
	
✓	Voice auto select: Turning on voice auto select allows you to select 
drum voices with your MIDI controller. This feature is useful when you’re 
going back and forth between two sounds. You can use one hand to 
select the drum voice with your MIDI controller while editing the synth 
section with your other hand.
	
✓	Import: Click the Import button to import sounds and sequences from 
other Ultrabeat drum kits as well as EXS24 sampler instruments. For 
more on the EXS24 sampler, see Chapter 11.
	
✓	MIDI controller assignment: You can assign MIDI controllers to the four 
controller slots, which allows you to modulate the synthesizer section.
Choosing sounds in the assignment section
You use the assignment section, shown in Figure 9-10, to select and mix drum 
sounds. Here’s a description of the assignment section parameters:
	
✓	Master volume slider: This slider, which is at the top of the assignment 
section, controls the volume of the entire drum kit.
	
✓	Keyboard: The vertical keyboard is playable; each key lights when a 
drum voice is played.
	
✓	Volume slider: You can drag the blue slider on each drum voice left and 
right to lower and raise, respectively, the volume of the sound. Control-
click the volume slider to display a menu where you can copy and paste 
voices and sequences as well as initialize the drum sound to one of sev­
eral default sounds.
	
✓	Sequence: If the drum sound is associated with a sequence, you see a 
sequence indicator next to the drum sound number.
	
✓	Mute and solo icons: Click the mute (M) icon to silence the drum sound. 
Click the solo (S) icon to silence all other drum sounds.
	
✓	Pan knob: Use the pan knob to place the drum sound in the stereo 
spectrum.
	
✓	Output menu: To the right of the pan knob is the output menu. Click 
the menu and choose the output of the drum voice. The options change 
depending on whether you load a stereo or multi-output instance of 
Ultrabeat.

Drum voices can be dragged and dropped. If you drag one voice onto another 
voice, the drum voices and synth settings are swapped. If you hold ⌘ while 
dragging and dropping the drum voice, the sequences are also swapped. 
Option-drag to copy (not swap) the sound but not the synth or sequencer 
settings. Hold down Option-⌘ while dragging to copy the sound as well as 
the sequences.
	
Don’t have a magnifying glass around? You can increase the size of the inter­
face for easier viewing by selecting a higher number on the View drop-down 
menu at the top of the software instrument interface.
Shaping sounds in the synthesizer section
You shape the currently selected drum sound in the synthesizer section, as 
shown in Figure 9-11. The synthesizer signal flow moves from left to right. 
Don’t let all the buttons and knobs intimidate you. At the most basic level, 
you generate sounds at the far left, filter sounds in the middle, and shape the 
envelope and volume of sounds at the far right.

 Chapter 9: Making Beats with Drummer and Ultrabeat
	
Figure 9-11: 
The 
Ultrabeat 
synthesizer 
section.
	
Here’s a brief description of the Ultrabeat sound generators:
	
✓	Oscillator 1: The top sound generator is called oscillator 1. You turn 
it on and off with the power button in the upper left. You can choose 
between a phase oscillator, FM synthesis, or external side-chain input. 
As you choose each synthesis mode, the oscillator 1 parameters change 
to give you further tone-shaping capabilities.
	
✓	Oscillator 2: The bottom sound generator is called oscillator 2. You 
turn it on or off with the power button in the lower left. You can choose 
between a phase oscillator, a sampler, or component modeling. Choosing 
each synthesis type updates the oscillator 2 parameters.
	
✓	Noise generator: The middle section is a noise generator, and you can 
turn it on or off by the power button at the left. There are no additional 
parameters aside from what you are given.
The scope of this book couldn’t possibly touch on every parameter in each of 
the sound generators. However, I don’t want to leave you hanging, so here are 
a few things you can try with each tone generator:
	
✓	Oscillator 1 is great for synth sounds. Set it to Phase Osc, turn the Slope 
knob and Saturation slider all the way down, and turn the Asym (asym­
metry) slider all the way up. Depending on the envelope parameter 
                           

146
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
settings, you should have a useful synth bass sound. If you ⌘-click 
the drum voice name in the assignment section and choose Init➪Bass, 
Ultrabeat will produce a bass synth that you can begin tweaking.
	
✓	Oscillator 2 works great as a sampler. Set it to Sample, click the Sample 
Name display, and choose Load on the drop-down menu. Navigate to 
an audio file on your hard drive and the sample will load, allowing you 
to play it from your MIDI controller. Alternately, you can ⌘-click the 
drum voice name in the assignment section and choose Init➪Sample; 
Ultrabeat will set the oscillator to a pre-loaded sample that you can 
shape or replace.
	
✓	The noise generator is great for creating snare sounds, and it’s also 
useful when combined with the other oscillators. To hear a noise genera­
tor in action, ⌘-click the drum voice name in the assignment section and 
choose Init➪Snare. Turn off oscillator 1 and notice how much of a snare 
sound is generated by noise.
The rounded filter section in the center of Ultrabeat, shown in Figure 9-12, 
gives you more tonal-shaping capabilities. The top half of the filter section is 
dedicated to the filter while the bottom half controls a distortion circuit.
	
Figure 9-12: 
The 
Ultrabeat 
filter 
section.
	
Here’s a brief description of the parameters you can use to adjust your 
sound:
	
✓	Filter on/off: Click the filter name at the top of the filter section to turn 
the entire filter section on or off.
	
✓	Filter type: Click the filter type buttons to change the filter type to LP 
(low pass), HP (high pass), BP (band pass), or BR (band rejection).
                           

147
 Chapter 9: Making Beats with Drummer and Ultrabeat
	
✓	Filter slope: Click the filter slope buttons to change the filter slope to 12 dB 
or 24 dB. The higher the filter slope, the more extreme the filtering.
	
✓	Cutoff: Rotate the cutoff knob to adjust the cutoff frequency of the differ­
ent filter types. Rotate the knob to the left to lower the frequency and to 
the right to raise the frequency.
	
✓	Resonance: Rotate the resonance knob to adjust how the cutoff fre­
quency affects the filters.
	
✓	Mod and Via menus: Click the Mod parameters to choose a modulation 
source for the cutoff and resonance parameters. Click the Via param­
eters to select a MIDI controller assignment or velocity to control the 
modulation source.
	
✓	Crush button: Click the crush button to turn on the bit crusher. The 
bit crusher lowers the digital resolution of the sound, creating a digital 
distortion effect. If the crush button is engaged, the distortion button is 
disengaged.
	
✓	Distortion button: Click the distortion button to distort your sound 
by using an analog-modeled overdrive effect. If the distortion button is 
engaged, the crush button is disengaged.
	
✓	Drive knob: Rotate the drive knob to adjust the amount of distortion.
	
✓	Color knob: Rotate the color knob to change the tone of the distortion. 
Rotate it to the right to make the sound brighter, and rotate it to the left 
to make the sound darker.
	
✓	Level knob: Rotate the level knob to set the level of distortion while in 
distortion mode. If crush mode is engaged, this knob sets the threshold 
before bit crushing begins.
The right section of the Ultrabeat interface, shown in Figure 9-13, is dedicated 
to amplifying the drum sound, modulating the drum sound, and shaping the 
envelope of the drum sound. Here’s a brief description of the three sections 
on the right side of the Ultrabeat synthesizer:
	
✓	Output: The middle area is where you change the volume, two-band EQ, 
and stereo panning of the drum sound.
	
✓	LFO: The top area is where you change how sound parameters are mod­
ulated by the LFOs (low frequency oscillators), envelope generators, 
velocity, and MIDI controllers.
	
✓	Envelope: The bottom area is where you adjust the ADSR (attack, decay, 
sustain, and release) envelope for the drum sound.
                           

148
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
	
Figure 9-13: 
The 
Ultrabeat 
output, 
LFO, and 
envelope 
section.
	
Here’s how you can shape your sound with the output section:
	
✓	Use the two-band EQ to brighten or darken the sound. Each EQ has two 
types available: a shelving EQ and a peak EQ. Use the shelving button to 
remove frequencies above or below the level set in the Frequency (Hz) 
field. Use the peak EQ to raise or lower the frequencies around the level 
set in the Frequency (Hz) field. Set the Q field to change the width of the 
EQ boost or cut. Use the level knob to set the amount of EQ boost or cut. 
Finally, click either EQ band names to turn the EQ on or off.
	
✓	Use Pan Mod (modulation) or Spread to adjust the drum sound in the 
stereo field. (Only one of them can be selected at a time.) Clicking the 
name of the Pan Mod or Spread parameter either turns it on or off or 
toggles between the two options while displaying the parameters.
	
✓	Use the envelope section to graphically shape the attack, decay, sustain, 
and release (ADSR) of the drum sound. Each sound has four envelopes 
numbered 1 through 4, with 4 hardwired to the sound’s volume. The 
other three envelopes can be modulated by various Ultrabeat sound 
parameters. Click any envelope number and then drag the envelope 
graphic handles to shape the envelope.
As you can see, Ultrabeat is a beast of a drum synth. It’s safe to say that most 
Ultrabeat users get a lot out of it without ever touching most of the param­
eters. The easiest way to find sounds that you like is to load different presets

 Chapter 9: Making Beats with Drummer and Ultrabeat
from the top of the software instrument interface. Ultrabeat comes with 
dozens of kits that sound amazing without any tweaking. But if you feel like 
tweaking drum sounds, Ultrabeat will keep you thoroughly entertained.
Sequencing patterns in the step sequencer
The Ultrabeat step sequencer, shown in Figure 9-14, is used to edit pat­
terns for the currently selected drum sound and to control entire Ultrabeat 
sequences.
Figure 9-14: 
The 
Ultrabeat 
step 
sequencer.
	
You don’t have to use the integrated step sequencer in Ultrabeat. You can play 
Ultrabeat’s drum sounds from MIDI regions just like other software instruments. 
But if you enjoy step sequencing, you’ll like using Ultrabeat’s sequencer. As you 
see in this section, exporting beats into the tracks area is easy.
The left side of the step sequencer contains the following global parameters:
	
✓	On/off icon: Click the on/off icon to turn the pattern sequencer on or off.
	
✓	Edit mode toggle button: Click the edit mode button to toggle between 
voice mode and step mode. While in the default voice mode, any edit 
you make to a drum’s sound is global. While in step mode, you can auto­
mate the sound parameters with each step of the pattern sequencer.
	
✓	Play icon: Click the play icon to start and stop the pattern sequencer.
	
✓	Swing knob: The Swing knob adjusts the amount of shuffle feel for any 
drum sound that has swing enabled.
                           

150
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
To the right of the global parameters is a small section for the following pat­
tern parameters:
	
✓	Pattern menu: Click the menu to choose one of 24 patterns. If a pattern 
slot has a pattern available, it will be marked with the letters sq. You can 
copy, paste, and clear patterns by Control-clicking the menu.
	
✓	Length field: Double-click the length field to enter the length of the 
pattern.
	
✓	Length bar: The length bar spans the entire length of the top of the pat­
tern sequencer. Drag the right edge of the bar to change the length of 
the pattern.
	
✓	Resolution menu: The resolution menu determines the note length 
value of the pattern. A setting of 1/8 means that each step of the grid 
represents an eighth note and 1/16 represents a sixteenth note. Other 
available resolutions are 1/12 (triplet), 1/24 (sextuplet), and 1/32 (thirty-
second note).
	
✓	Accent button: Click the Accent button to turn on the accent function. 
When accents are on, clicking the accent buttons above the pattern 
steps globally accent that beat in the pattern.
	
✓	Accent slider: Drag the Accent slider to the right to raise the level of the 
accents.
	
✓	Swing enable button: The Swing button turns the swing function on or 
off for individual sounds.
The largest area of the pattern sequencer is dedicated to the step grid, which 
plays the drum patterns. The step grid has the following parameters:
	
✓	Trigger row: The trigger row contains numbers that identify the beat. 
Click the number buttons to play the currently selected sound on that 
beat. Click the button again to turn the sound off. Control-click the trig­
ger row to display a menu of available functions for automatically creat­
ing beats as well as copy, paste, and clear functions.
	
✓	Velocity/Gate row: The Velocity/Gate row sets the length and velocity of 
the note. Drag the height to set the note velocity and the width to set the 
length. Control-click the Velocity/Gate row to display a menu of velocity 
functions, including a randomize feature.
	
✓	Accent row: The Accent row is above the trigger row. Click the beats 
you want to accent.
	
Click the Full View button on the bottom right of the pattern sequencer to 
turn the entire Ultrabeat interface into a pattern sequencer, as shown in 
Figure 9-15. Click any area of the grid to turn a drum sound on or off on that 
beat. Visualizing the entire pattern with all the drum sounds makes program­
ming beats a breeze.

Controlling patterns with MIDI
You can trigger the Ultrabeat patterns by using MIDI. Along the bottom row of 
parameters in the step sequencer is the Pattern Mode on/off button and play­
back mode menu. To trigger the patterns:
	
1.	Turn on the Ultrabeat pattern sequencer.
	
2.	Turn on pattern mode.
	
3.	Play the key associated with the pattern.
	
	 The pattern will begin playing. To find the key associated with the pat­
tern, click the pattern menu to see the list of patterns and corresponding 
MIDI keys.
You can decide how the patterns behave when triggered from the pattern 
mode menu. Choosing One-Shot Trigger plays the pattern once through. 
Choosing Sustain plays the pattern only while the key is sustained. Choosing 
                           

152
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
Toggle plays the pattern repeatedly until the key is played again. Choosing 
Toggle on Step 1 is similar to Toggle except the pattern won’t stop until the 
pattern has completed.
	
Click the Voice Mute Mode button to mute single drum sounds with MIDI 
keys. Use the two octaves above the pattern trigger keys (C1–B2) to mute and 
unmute drum sounds. Muting drum voices is useful for remixing and adding 
interest in your drum arrangements.
Exporting patterns into the tracks area
The Ultrabeat pattern sequencer is a lot of fun and a great tool for building 
beats. But sometimes you might want more control over the MIDI patterns. 
Exporting your Ultrabeat pattern into the tracks area is simple.
Drag the pattern icon from the bottom of the global parameters section 
into the tracks area. A MIDI region the length of the pattern will be added to 
the tracks area. If you’re going to trigger the Ultrabeat sounds from a MIDI 
region instead of the pattern sequencer, make sure you turn off the pattern 
sequencer in Ultrabeat. For a video that details how to make beats and pat­
terns with Ultrabeat (and Drummer), visit http://logicstudiotraining.

Software instrument tracks with Ultrabeat get their own set of smart controls.
Wow. Drums are a big deal. And Logic Pro X puts a lot of resources into 
making beats and banging drums. But more importantly, the intuitive inter­
faces and raw power of Logic Pro X make it easy for you to give your drums 
the attention they deserve. You can have control over the smallest detail, or 
you can have Drummer and Ultrabeat play for you.
Go play!

In This Chapter
▶	Loading and playing the vintage instruments
▶	Editing instrument sounds and effects
▶	Producing classic and creative tones
▶	Understanding keyboard and synthesizer fundamentals
T

he vintage instruments included in Logic Pro might make you want to 
put drink rings and cigarette burns on your laptop because these clas­
sic keyboards can evoke the sounds of yesteryear. But they also can freshen 
the music of today — you’d be hard-pressed to throw a dart at the Billboard 
charts and not find one or more of these instruments somewhere in the track.
The sounds of these vintage keyboards are heard in almost all musical 
genres. Music producers depend on them and musicians adore playing them. 
And what’s not to love? They’re simple to use, and their tonal capabilities are 
limitless. Perhaps best of all, you can get great sounds with these software 
instruments without the hassle of vintage gear upkeep and the two or three 
strong bodies required to transport them.
In this chapter, I show you how to load, edit, and play the vintage software 
instruments in Logic Pro X. You find out how to use them creatively so they 
can meet your demands. You also pick up some tips on making them sound 
authentic and classic. If a client ever craves a vintage keyboard, you’ll be able 
to deliver the right sound.

Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
Taking Stock of Vintage Instruments
Logic Pro X gives you four virtual vintage software instruments:
	
✓	Vintage B3: This software instrument is modeled on a Hammond B3 organ 
and Leslie speaker. The Hammond B3 is an electric organ that generates 
its sound from tonewheels, spinning discs that determine the pitch and 
transmit the signal to a magnetized rod and coil. The Leslie speaker con­
tains two speakers: The top passes the sound through a rotating horn, 
and the bottom passes the sound through a rotating drum.
	
✓	Vintage Clav: This instrument is a modeled on a Hohner Clavinet D6 
keyboard. The Clavinet (Clav for short) has guitar-like strings that are 
struck by a hammer. Magnetic pickups transmit the signal through a 
filter section to shape your sound.
	
✓	Vintage electric piano: This one is a simulation of three famous electric 
pianos — Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer, and Hohner Electra-Piano. These 
electric pianos have hammers that strike metal tines or reeds. All three 
electric pianos are similar in sound and have metallic bell-like qualities.
	
✓	Retro Synth: It’s four classic synthesizers in one — analog, sync, wave­
table, and FM. Each type of synthesis gives you a completely different 
sound.
Loading and playing vintage instruments
To use the vintage instruments in Logic Pro X, you must first create a soft­
ware instrument track: On the main menu, choose Track➪New Software 
Instrument Track. The default software instrument is the vintage electric 
piano. You can add a vintage instrument to the selected software instrument 
track in two ways:
	
✓	On the main menu, choose View➪Library and select a preset (called a 
patch in Logic Pro X) from the list of vintage instruments.
	
	Choosing Retro Synth from the library can be tricky because all synthe­
sizers in Logic Pro are grouped into a single Synthesizer menu. It’s faster 
to choose Retro Synth by using the next method. Later in the chapter, 
I show you how to save your own patches so you can quickly call up 
Retro Synth from the library.
	
✓	Choose View➪Show Inspector and select the vintage instrument in the 
software instrument slot. (See the section on the inspector in Chapter 3 
for details.)
                           

155
 Chapter 10: Playing Virtual Vintage Instruments
To play your software instrument, connect your MIDI controller (as described 
in Chapter 1), select the track, and start playing your MIDI controller. If you 
don’t have a MIDI controller connected, you can choose View➪Show Musical 
Typing to input notes with your computer keyboard or View➪Show Keyboard 
to input notes with your mouse or trackpad.
Choosing vintage instrument presets
Every software instrument has a preset menu at the top of its interface. 
These presets enable you to load and save your instrument settings.
	
A preset saves only the software instrument settings. Other settings on the 
track’s channel strip, such as volume and effects, are not saved. If you want to 
save the entire channel strip, including the software instrument settings, save 
your settings as a patch in the library (see Chapter 4).
	
When editing a factory preset, it’s best to make your changes to a copy. I like to 
keep factory presets in their original state and make my own edits on copies. 
Also, the user presets you create appear on the main menu and not on a sub­
menu, saving you a click down the road.
	
Save your default preset for instant recall when loading instruments. On the 
preset drop-down menu at the top of the software instrument interface, choose 
Save as Default. I have a starting position that I use on my real Hammond B3 
that I’ve copied over to the vintage B3 and saved as my default. Now, whenever 
I call up the vintage B3, it’s exactly the way I like it.
Spinning Your Tonewheels 
with the Vintage B3
The Hammond B3 is an important part of music history, and with the vintage 
B3, you can put its sonic stamp on your own music. Since the Hammond B3 
organ is found in country, gospel, reggae, rock, jazz, pop, and more, it’s safe 
to say that you’ll want to use the vintage B3.
A Hammond B3 is almost always paired with a Leslie speaker. The Leslie’s 
rotating design throws the organ sound throughout a room to make it sound 
bigger and omnipresent, like a pipe organ. The vintage B3 has a built-in rotor 
cabinet, which is an emulation of the Leslie speaker (built by Don Leslie).
The vintage B3 software instrument and rotor cabinet simulation emulate 
the real thing to the point that you can edit the age of a single component to 
make your organ sound fresh from the factory or 50 years old.
                           

156
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
In this section, I show you how use the vintage B3 drawbars and other organ 
parameters to shape your sound. You set up your default organ settings just 
like a professional B3 player. You also learn how to play the vintage B3 with 
multiple keyboard controllers for an authentic Hammond playing experience.
Understanding drawbars
Before I show you how to tweak the sound you can get from the vintage B3 
organ, you should create a new instrument track and select a preset for the 
vintage B3, as follows:
	
1.	On the main menu, choose Track➪New Software Instrument Track.
	
	 A new track appears in the main window track list.
	
2.	Choose View➪Show Library.
	
	 The Library window appears.
	
3.	Click the Vintage B3 Organ menu and select a preset.
	
	 For example, select Classic Rock Organ to create a sound similar to what 
organists used in 60s and 70s rock music.
	
4.	Access controls for the vintage B3 in one of two ways:
 
• Choose View➪Show Smart Controls to access a set of drawbars, 
rotor cabinet controls, and effects controls.
 
• Choose View➪Inspector and click the center of the instrument slot 
to see the full software instrument interface.
For the love of Hammond!
Every instrument has a story. The tale of my first 
Hammond organ is a journey through a blizzard 
in whiteout conditions. On the way home, with 
hundreds of pounds of organ in the back of my 
Chevy Bronco and less than 10 feet of visibility, I 
almost drove into the wrong lane of an on ramp 
on the opposite side of the highway.
Looking back, I don’t think I’d do anything dif­
ferently. You couldn’t keep me from taking 
that organ home where it belonged. It was 
a Hammond L-100 with a Leslie 122 speaker, 
both painted white to mimic ones owned by 
the Beatles. The owner chopped it in half so 
it could be transported easily. But there was 
nothing easy about carrying those giant chunks 
of organ up three flights of stairs into my tiny 
studio apartment.
Tubes and tonewheels are worth the pain. 
Today, I have a Hammond B3 and Leslie 122 
in my living room, and each day I say “Good 
morning!” to them while I’m having my first cup 
of coffee. I’m biased, but I don’t think it’s pos­
sible to have too much organ in your tracks. A 
Hammond B3 is always just right.
                           

157
 Chapter 10: Playing Virtual Vintage Instruments
	
Your drawbars are your main tools for tone shaping. You can always get to 
them quickly by using your track’s smart controls or by clicking the Main 
button, which is on the top control bar of the vintage B3 organ interface.
Take a look at your three sets of drawbars — Upper, Pedals, and Lower — as 
shown in Figure 10-1. Pull the drawbar out (by pulling down) to make the 
drawbar louder, and push the drawbar in (by pushing up) to make the draw­
bar quieter or silent. Drawbars are like mixer faders but in reverse.
	
Figure 10-1: 
Main 
window of 
the vintage 
B3 Organ.
	
The upper and lower nine drawbars correspond to the upper and lower key­
boards of a Hammond B3 organ. These two keyboards are called manuals. B3 
players usually play bass lines and rhythm parts on the lower manual and 
solos and melodies on the upper manual, though anything goes in the hands 
of a skilled musician. The pedal drawbars correspond to the B3 foot pedals. 
Each set of drawbars control the volume of different aspects of the pitch you 
are playing.
Sine waves and the harmonic series
	
The Hammond B3 tonewheel was designed to create a pure sine wave, the 
simplest sound in existence. Playing a key on the B3 spins a tonewheel that 
generates a pure pitch. Every pitch corresponds to a frequency, which is the 
number of cycles that the sound completes in one second. All sounds except 
a pure sine wave contain different frequencies based on the mathematical har­
monic series.
                           

158
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
The third drawbar of the Hammond B3 is close to a pure sine wave. The other 
drawbars are frequencies of the harmonic series, as shown in Figure 10-2, and 
control the complexity of the sound so that you can create and mold sounds 
similar to a flute, an oboe, a trumpet, or even a string section.
	
Figure 10-2: 
The draw-
bars in rela-
tion to the 
harmonic 
series.
	
You can think of the drawbars in two sets of divisions that outline how you 
use them to shape the sound of the organ. The first set is divided by function 
and moves from left to right:
	
✓	Subdrawbars: The first two drawbars control the volume of frequencies 
below the fundamental pitch you are playing.
	
	Technically, the second drawbar controls the volume of a frequency 
above the pitch you’re playing, but it’s mathematically related to the 
first drawbar so they’re joined at the hip. These two subdrawbars are 
used to add bass to or take bass from the overall sound.
	
✓	Foundation drawbars: The next four drawbars control the volume of the 
fundamental frequency and frequencies above it.
	
	The third drawbar controls the volume of the fundamental pitch. Pull it 
out all the way by itself and you hear a single frequency, a simple sine 
wave. The third drawbar is almost always used to some degree.
	
	The fourth, fifth, and sixth drawbars control the second, third, and 
fourth harmonics. The fourth drawbar gets pulled out a lot in rock. The 
fifth through sixth drawbars are commonly used in gospel or whenever 
you want more upper harmonics in your sound.
	
✓	Brilliance: The seventh, eighth, and ninth drawbars control the fifth, 
sixth, and eighth harmonics (the seventh harmonic is skipped).
                           

159
 Chapter 10: Playing Virtual Vintage Instruments
	
	The ninth drawbar is often pulled out in jazz solos and gives your tone a 
whistle. The other two drawbars are pulled out when you want extreme 
highs, as in a full organ sound. Another common setting called the squab­
ble uses the last four drawbars pulled all the way out along the first 
drawbar.
The second set is divided by color, with each color describing the function in 
the harmonic series:
	
✓	White (consonance): The white drawbars correspond to consonant har­
monics, which are perfect octaves of the fundamental pitch. Pulling all 
the white drawbars out gives you a tall sound of four stacked octaves.
	
✓	Black (dissonance): The black drawbars correspond to the dissonant 
harmonics, which include fifths and a major third. Don’t let the name dis­
sonance fool you. Adding these harmonics makes the sound big and rich.
	
✓	Brown (sub): The brown drawbars correspond to the subharmonics. 
These subfrequencies, especially the octave below the fundamental, are 
used frequently because they allow you to get the quintessential B3 bass 
sound that is played with the left hand on the lower manual.
	
	Even though the second brown drawbar is considered a subtone, it’s a 
fifth higher than the fundamental pitch you’re playing. Pull this drawbar 
out all the way for great solo sounds. It’s often pushed in about halfway 
for chordal accompaniment and bass lines.
Common drawbar setups
Drawbar notation is simple to understand. There are nine drawbars and each 
has eight increments of volume. A drawbar setting that includes only the 
third drawbar (the fundamental pitch) would look like this: 008000000. If you 
also pulled out the first drawbar, the setting would be 808000000.
Following are some classic drawbar settings below.
	
✓	Lower manual: 848000000. Use this drawbar setting for playing bass 
lines with your left hand and accompaniment with your right. You can 
experiment with the level of the second drawbar until it sounds good to 
you. You can also pull out the ninth drawbar to 1 or 2 to add just a touch 
of brightness. This drawbar setting is versatile.
	
✓	Upper manual: 888000000. This setting is a subtle variation on the 
lower manual setting but it makes a big difference. Having the first three 
drawbars all the way out gives the upper manual just enough volume 
to cut through the lower manual as well as a full band. Pull out the last 
drawbar to between 2 and 4 to add a high whistle tone and cut through 
the mix even more. If you need more volume and presence to cut 
through the mix, pull out the fourth drawbar all the way to 8 as well.
                           

160
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
	
✓	Pedals: 80. The pedals have only two drawbars, and the second drawbar 
isn’t used much. Most organists push in both pedal drawbars all the way 
when a bass player is present. However, when there’s no bass player, 
pull out the first bass drawbar to between 6 and 8 and blend it with the 
rest of the organ and band. Because you play the pedals with your feet, 
it’s uncommon to hear intricate and fluid lines coming from them unless 
you’re one of the few living virtuosos. For authenticity, keep your pedal 
bass lines simple.
Get the vintage vibe with vibrato/chorus 
and percussion
In addition to the drawbars, the B3 has two blocks of effects that you can 
apply to your sound: vibrato/chorus and percussion.
Vibrato/chorus
Vibrato introduces pulsating pitch variation to varying degrees, with V1 the 
slowest and V3 the fastest. Chorus is created by mixing the vibrato with the 
unaffected tone. Chorus has three settings, C1 through C3, which correspond 
to the three vibrato settings.
You can control the vintage B3 vibrato/chorus in two ways:
	
✓	Software instrument interface: Click the Main button at the top of the 
vintage B3 interface and then click the Controls button at the bottom. 
A panel opens with the vibrato/chorus controls on the left and percus­
sion controls on the right. In the center of the panel is a Drive knob that 
works only if you have distortion turned on in the Effects panel of the 
vintage B3.
	
	Use the toggle buttons to turn on or off the vibrato/chorus effect on the 
upper or lower manual. Choose the vibrato/chorus setting (V1 through 
C3) with the rotary knob.
	
✓	Smart controls: To display smart controls in the tracks area of the Logic 
Pro main window, click the Smart Controls button at the top of the main 
window or choose View➪Show Smart Controls. Or if you want smart 
controls in a separate window, choose Window➪Open Smart Controls. 
The smart controls have a toggle button that turns vibrato/chorus on 
or off for the upper manual. For a smart controls refresher, refer to 
Chapter 3.
Chorus is used more than vibrato, but the warbly vibrato makes some classic 
movie-theater organ sounds. The C3 chorus setting probably has the most 
followers because it fattens up your organ tone.
                           

161
 Chapter 10: Playing Virtual Vintage Instruments
	
Using the chorus effect with the Leslie Rotor Cabinet gives you a sound with a 
lot of motion. I usually start with the Leslie set to spin slow or set to brake, so 
it doesn’t spin at all. I play with the chorus set to C3 for a fat sound with lots of 
motion. Then when I kick the Leslie on fast, I get a powerful shift with dramatic 
effects. It’s a great technique for building musical climaxes.
Percussion
The percussion effect is a unique bell tone on top of the organ sound. 
Percussion is monophonic, which means it plays only one note at a time. 
You have to let go of the first key if you want the percussion to sound on the 
second key. This effect works well with a short, staccato playing style but 
it can also sound great at the beginning of phrases that are connected and 
legato.
You need to know a couple things about the percussion effect as it relates 
to a real Hammond B3. On a real B3, percussion works only on the upper 
manual. The software replicates this characteristic, but you can remove this 
limitation by clicking the Options button on the vintage B3 interface and 
changing the Perc On Preset parameter to All. Also, on a real B3, turning on 
the percussion turns off the ninth drawbar. The software doesn’t re-create 
this behavior, so if you’re a Hammond B3 player looking for authenticity, 
you’ll have to turn off the ninth drawbar when you turn on percussion.
	
If a jazz musician has percussion turned on, it’s usually the third harmonic set 
to fast and soft. You can create a cool piano effect pushing in all the drawbars 
and playing the second harmonic set to slow and normal. Try it out.
Playing with presets
The real Hammond B3 has a lower octave of reverse-colored keys on both the 
upper and lower manual that select hardwired drawbar presets. This function 
is duplicated on the vintage B3. Click the Presets button on the bottom of the 
vintage B3 interface and you’ll see the drawbar presets laid out like a key­
board octave. You can use your keyboard controller to select these presets. 
The lowest note, C, clears all the drawbar settings and no sound is heard. 
Keys C# through B choose presets that instantly change your drawbars. You 
can also select these presets manually by clicking them.
Edit the drawbar presets by selecting a preset and adjusting the drawbars. 
Note that these presets only store and recall the drawbar positions and not 
vintage B3 effects or other parameters. The original B3 has presets that 
emulate strings, flute, clarinet, and other acoustic instruments. You can get 
an amazing assortment of sounds with the vintage B3 as well just by playing 
with the presets. If you want a vintage B3 patch with the original Hammond 
B3 presets, visit http://logicstudiotraining.com/b3patch and I’ll 
hook you up.

Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
Spinning the Leslie
The Leslie speaker is a huge part of the Hammond B3 sound and experience. 
The rotor cabinet in the vintage B3 instrument is an amazing emulation of the 
iconic Leslie speaker.
You can control rotor cabinet parameters in the smart controls and in the 
vintage B3 software instrument interface:
	
✓	Smart controls: To access the smart controls in the tracks area, choose 
View➪Show Smart Controls. You can choose the rotor cabinet’s rotation 
speed with the lever in the lower-left corner of the smart controls.
	
✓	Software instrument interface: Click the Rotor Cabinet button on the 
top control bar of the vintage B3 interface to control the Leslie speaker 
options.
A Leslie speaker has a rotating horn at the top and a rotating drum at the 
bottom. At the bottom left of the interface, click the Rotation toggle switch to 
change the rotation speed to Slow, Brake (off), or Fast. At the far right of the 
interface, switch the mic position to Rear to see the horn and drum animated 
in real time as you adjust the speed settings. You’ll also hear a big variation in 
the different mic positions. If you want to mellow the sound, set mic position 
to Front, as shown in Figure 10-3.

163
 Chapter 10: Playing Virtual Vintage Instruments
You can also change the cabinet type to other Leslie models. The Proline 
cabinet is a black Tolex-covered cabinet, similar to a guitar amp, and has a 
more open sound. Click the mics and you’ll be given a few mono and stereo 
mic choices. It’s common to record the drum mono and horn stereo. Because 
the drum carries the low frequencies, a stereo spread isn’t as dramatic and 
can take up too much bass energy in a mix.
Choose the stereo width and balance of your mics on the left side of the 
Rotor Cabinet control panel. Edit the motor acceleration speed to customize 
the transition from slow to fast. The Motor Control setting enables you to 
spin the horn and drum independently.
Going deep into expert options
Three more panels of controls (Options, Effects, and Expert) give you ways 
to customize the B3 that would be difficult to achieve with the Hammond B3. 
The Options and Expert panels let you customize how the B3 sounds and 
behaves, and the Effects panel adds perfectly paired effects to your sound as 
follows:
	
✓	Options: These settings control the tuning, volume, and expression level 
of the vintage B3.
	
	A key characteristic of the B3 is the volume pedal. You’ll find your­
self constantly adjusting the volume during a performance, and the 
Expression knob lets you adjust the sensitivity of your connected 
expression pedal.
	
	Another important part of the B3 sound is the key click. On the vin­
tage B3, you can adjust several aspects of its sound in the Options and 
Expert panels. The Options panel also gives you finer control of percus­
sion and vibrato/chorus.
	
	The Morph function allows you to smoothly switch between two pre­
sets, much like an organist would achieve with a hand pushing and pull­
ing drawbars. You can adjust the Morph characteristics on the Options 
panel, and you can control it from the Presets area of the Main panel.
	
✓	Expert: These settings turn your B3 into a factory-fresh classic or a 
used-and-abused road warrior. You can adjust the age of the filters, the 
amount of drawbar leak, and the key click color. You can further adjust 
pitch and sustain, and choose your hardware controller.
	
	The organ model options let you adjust balance between pedals, lower 
manual, and upper manual. The shape slider changes your organ from 
a B3 to a Farfisa, Solina, or Yamaha organ. You can also adjust the bass 
filter and add another octave to the low end of the upper and lower 
                           

164
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
manuals. If you find yourself needing to lower your CPU usage, you can 
slide Maximum Wheels to the left, lowering the number of emulated 
tonewheels.
	
✓	Effects: This panel has four perfectly paired effects for the B3 — reverb, 
equalizer, wah wah, and distortion.
	
	A Reverb control gives you a choice of seven types of reverb. The 
Equalizer can tame or boost your lows, mids, and highs. The wah wah is 
one of those effects you don’t usually get to try on a real B3 unless it’s 
been retrofitted to interface with external effects devices. The same goes 
for distortion. While you can get the Leslie speaker to overdrive, adding 
five types of distortion to a B3 is only possible with a retrofit. Not so for 
the vintage B3.
Controlling the manuals and foot 
pedals with MIDI controllers
If you have more than one keyboard controller or a dual-manual controller, 
you can get the full B3 experience by setting each controller to a different 
MIDI channel and playing the upper and lower manuals together. Click the 
Split button on the lower right of the Main panel to set the MIDI channels. 
Don’t forget the pedals!
Funking Up the Vintage Clav
The original Hohner Clavinet keyboard has a strong link to some funky key­
board players, such as Stevie Wonder and Herbie Hancock. It has a percus­
sive guitar-like sound that works great in syncopated funk. It also sounds 
great in rock, which Led Zeppelin proved in songs such as “Custard Pie” and 
“Trampled Under Foot.” From Bob Marley to Pink Floyd, the Clavinet (Clav 
for short) is a dominant sound in popular music. But searching for a vintage 
instrument in mint condition can be difficult and expensive. Good thing you’ll 
never have to search hard for the funky tone of a Clavinet as long as you have 
Logic Pro.
To play the vintage Clav, create a new software instrument track (as described 
previously, in the “Loading and playing vintage instruments” section) and 
choose a patch on the vintage Clav menu in the library.
                           

165
 Chapter 10: Playing Virtual Vintage Instruments
Choosing your Clav type
You can choose 14 Clav types on the pop-up menu on the left of the top con­
trol bar. Some types are based on actual instruments, but others are very dif­
ferent from the original instruments.
Classic I and II are models of the original Hohner Clavinet D6. Vintage I and II 
are modeled after road-worn Clavs. Other emulations include a harpsichord, 
dulcimer, sitar, and a bell-like model. These variations will give you more than 
just the classic Clavinet tone.
Picking your pickups
A real Clavinet is a simple instrument with a simple control set. It has upper 
and lower sets of magnetic pickups that transmit the sound of hammers hit­
ting guitar strings. You can play one pickup at a time or both.
On the Main panel of the vintage Clav interface, shown in Figure 10-4, you see 
the Pickup Position window in the upper left. You can select each pickup and 
drag it along the strings to create new sounds. I wish I could do that with a 
real Clavinet.

166
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
Below the pickups are the pickup selector toggle buttons. When you click 
them, the pickups change configuration as follows:
	
✓	Position A/C: Lower pickup only. This setting, which is often called the 
rhythm pickup, activates the pickup below the strings. It’s one of the 
most common pickup settings because of its strong fundamental tone.
	
✓	Position B/C: Upper pickup only. This setting, which is often called the 
treble pickup, activates the pickup above the strings. It’s used less often 
than position A/C due to a weaker fundamental tone but can be useful 
when you need more treble to cut through a mix.
	
✓	Position A/D: Both pickups, out of phase. This setting activates both 
upper and lower pickups out of phase, which cancels certain frequen­
cies, resulting in a thin and biting tone. This setting is rarely used but it’s 
perfect for cutting through a busy mix and when you want the Clavinet 
to occupy a smaller sonic space in the mix.
	
✓	Position B/D: Both pickups, in phase. This setting activates both upper 
and lower pickups at the same time. It’s the biggest tone of all the set­
tings, with lots of presence, and probably the second most commonly 
used setting.
Filtering your pickups
Your filter buttons are to the left of the pickup buttons. Your pickup selec­
tion has a big effect on how the filters affect your sound. On a real Clavinet, 
you must select a filter (the bottom half of the button must be down) or the 
Clav won’t make a sound. But on the vintage Clav, when no filter is selected 
(the top half of each button is down), it makes a pure Clavinet sound with no 
filtering. That means if you want to emulate a real Clavinet, at least one of the 
filters should be engaged.
Dampening and spreading your tone
The Clavinet also has a damper slider that removes the sustain of the strings 
and creates a shorter plucked sound, similar to a guitar being palm muted. 
You can engage the damper gradually by using the Damper slider at the 
bottom right of the interface.
Getting classic sounds with effects
A Clavinet would not be complete without a bevy of effects ready and wait­
ing, especially the wah-wah effect. Click the Effects button on the control bar 
to reveal the following four vintage Clav effects: 
                           

167
 Chapter 10: Playing Virtual Vintage Instruments
	
✓	Wah: The wah-wah pedal, made famous by guitarists such as Jimi 
Hendrix, is a perfect partner to the Clav. Choose from eight types of wah-
wah effect. Control the range and envelope with the rotary knobs. Add 
an expression pedal to your MIDI controller to control its funky filter 
sweep with your feet.
	
✓	Compressor: A compressor squashes your sound and reduces the 
dynamic range. It makes loud sounds softer and soft sounds louder and 
is a useful tool for taming peaks and raising the overall sound level. Turn 
the Ratio knob to the right to add more compression.
	
✓	Distortion: Distort your pure Clav tone into a subtle crunch or an in-
your-face growl. Adding distortion is great for rock rhythms and satu­
rated lead tones. Adjust the Gain and Tone knobs to your taste.
	
✓	Modulation: You can modulate your vintage Clav with a phaser, flanger, 
or chorus. A phaser is a narrow-band EQ cut that is swept back and forth 
through the frequency spectrum. A flanger creates washy phase cancel­
lations throughout the frequency spectrum. Chorus uses multiple delays 
for thickness and richness. Adjust the rate and intensity with the knobs. 
Clicking the note symbol in this section syncs the timing of the effect to 
the tempo of your song.
Extending your Clav
Click the Details button on the control bar and an extended parameter panel 
gives you even more control of your Clav. The Shape slider adjusts the sound 
of the hammers, and the Click parameters adjust how the hammers sound 
attacking and releasing the string.
Playing with the Key Off parameter is worthwhile because a big part of the 
Clavinet sound is the click made by releasing the key. Your MIDI controller 
needs to transmit release velocity values for the Key Off parameter to work. 
The String and Pitch parameters make a Clavinet owner like me grateful. You 
can adjust your strings without having to change them and without the pain­
staking tuning before every session. The Misc panel provides options for using 
your MIDI keyboard to control the vintage Clav, as well as the velocity curve 
and number of voices. If you’re pushing your computer resources, pull the 
Voices number down to free up some CPU.
	
You can adjust the stereo spread of the keys or the pickups using the Stereo 
Spread button. Select the key or pickup half of the button and drag up or down 
to adjust the stereo spread.

Getting the Tone of Tines with 
the Vintage Electric Piano
The sound of the Rhodes and Wurlitzer electric pianos are iconic and flex­
ible. No matter what genre of music you enjoy, you’ll be able to find a place in 
your track for some vintage electric piano. To use the vintage electric piano, 
create a software instrument track as described previously, in the “Loading 
and playing vintage instruments” section. The default instrument is the vin­
tage electric piano.
Exploring tines, reeds, and tone bars
In a Rhodes electric piano, every key strikes a long, thin, metal tuning-fork–
like bar called a tine. The Wurlitzer is similar to a Rhodes but uses steel 
instead of metal tines. A third electric piano available, the Electra-Piano, 
is modeled after the Hohner Electra-Piano and has a sound similar to the 
Rhodes and Wurlitzer.
You can choose between nineteen electric piano models on the Model pop-up 
menu at the top of the vintage electric piano interface, which is shown in 
Figure 10-5.

 Chapter 10: Playing Virtual Vintage Instruments
Producing great sounds 
with timeless effects
Every electric piano model gives you access to the following classic and great 
sounding effects:
	
✓	EQ: A simple EQ can adjust your bass and treble frequencies.
	
✓	Drive: Two types of drive distort and crunch your electric piano.
	
✓	Chorus, phaser, and tremolo: The chorus, phaser, and tremolo modu­
late your sound into a shimmery and pulsating piano. Chorus uses mul­
tiple delays to give you a thick and rich sound. Phasing is a narrow-band 
EQ cut that is swept back and forth through the frequency spectrum. 
Tremolo varies the volume and is a standard effect built-in to a Wurlitzer. 
Click the note symbol in the Phaser and Tremolo sections to sync the 
timing of the effect to the tempo of your song.
Playing with additional parameters
The vintage electric piano is the simplest keyboard of the bunch, but it still 
gives you modifications that would be hard to achieve with a real electric 
piano. Click the Details button in the control bar to access the advanced 
parameters.
Like the other vintage instruments, you can adjust the number of voices if 
you find yourself running out of computer processing power. You can adjust 
the decay and release of the tines as well as the volume of the bell and 
damper noise. A stereo width knob can rein in your sound or expand to the 
far reaches of the stereo spectrum. The Pitch section allows you to adjust the 
overall tuning, warmth, stretch tuning, and pitch bend range. Try doing that 
with a real Rhodes!
Fusing Four Synths with Retro Synth
Retro Synth is four synths in one. It’s a sixteen-voice synthesizer that can 
easily switch between four of the most popular types of synthesis. From deep 
bass to screaming leads, Retro Synth has you covered. The best part is how 
easy it is to dive in and get good sounds quickly. The second best part is that 
all these synths don’t collect dust in a wing of your rock star mansion.
                           

170
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
Choosing your flavor of synthesis: Analog, 
sync, wavetable, and FM
The upper-left section of the Retro Synth interface, shown in Figure 10-6, 
allows you to choose between the following synth engines:
	
✓	Analog: Analog synthesis is found in classic synthesizers. It’s great for 
leads, basses, and pads.
	
✓	Sync: Sync is a more aggressive type of synthesis. It’s less suitable for 
pads and just right for leads and basses.
	
✓	Table: Wavetable synthesis is used for real instrument sounds in addi­
tion to synthesized sounds. It’s perfect for synth/acoustic hybrids.
	
✓	FM: Frequency modulation (FM) synthesis creates classic digital sounds. 
It’s excellent for bells, electric pianos, and bass sounds.
	
Figure 10-6: 
The Retro 
Synth main 
window.
	
Controlling your synth parameters
After choosing a synthesis type, you can further shape your sound in the 
Oscillator and Filter sections:
	
✓	Oscillator: The Retro Synth oscillators generate the waveforms that 
form your basic synth sound. The controls in the Oscillator section 
change depending on which type of synthesis you have selected. 
                           

171
 Chapter 10: Playing Virtual Vintage Instruments
Synths are fun when you simply play with the knobs and sliders and see 
what happens. The Oscillator section is where you do your main tone 
shaping.
	
✓	Filter: The Filter section shapes the sound coming from your oscillators. 
Choose the type of filter in the pop-up title bar at the top of the section. 
You can choose from low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band reject, or 
peak filters. Each filter allows certain frequencies to pass through and 
can be further modified with the other filter controls.
	
✓	Amp: The Amp section sets the global synth volume. You can also mix in 
a sine wave with your synth sound to make it bigger.
	
✓	Glide/Autobend: Choose either Glide or Autobend in the pop-up title 
bar at the top of the section. Glide controls how the pitch of a note 
bends into the pitch of the following note. Autobend controls how a note 
bends when you first play it.
	
✓	Global: Click the Settings button on the bottom right of the Retro Synth 
interface to get to the global settings. Here you can adjust pitch settings, 
adjust the stereo spread, and choose how many voices can be played at 
one time. You can also adjust how your MIDI controller interacts with 
the Retro Synth.
Modifying synth effects
On the top right of the Retro Synth interface is a simple Effects section where 
you can choose between a chorus and flanger:
	
✓	Chorus: Chorus gives you a thick and rich sound by the use of multiple 
delays. You can adjust the mix of the chorus as well as the chorus rate.
	
✓	Flanger: Flanging combines the original signal with itself, creating washy 
phase cancellations throughout the frequency spectrum. Like with the 
chorus, you can adjust the mix and rate.
Modulating the synth
Modulation alters your sound to make it interesting and exciting. You can use 
modulation to create vibrato, modify the filters, affect the volume, and lots of 
other less than realistic effects.
You can modulate your oscillator waveforms with the following parameters:
	
✓	LFO: Your low frequency oscillator (LFO) is a waveform that will modu­
late your sound. Choose different waveforms and rates to create unique 
modulations. You can control the LFO from your MIDI controller’s 
                           

172
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
modulation wheel or with aftertouch (pressure applied to a key on a key­
board while the key is being held down) on the source pop-up menu on 
the bottom right of the LFO section or both.
	
✓	Vibrato: Add vibrato to your synth sound by using the same controls as 
the LFO.
	
✓	Filter envelope: The filter envelope adjusts the attack, decay, sustain, 
and release (ADSR) of your filter. Drag the envelope handles in the dis­
play to adjust your filter envelope.
	
✓	Amp envelope: Similar to the filter envelope, the amp envelope adjusts 
the ADSR of the overall Retro Synth volume. Faster attack times create 
instantaneous sounds while slower attack times make the sound appear 
gradually.
	
✓	Controller: Click the Settings button on the bottom right of the Retro 
Synth interface to adjust global parameters such as tuning and the number 
of voices. The right side of the Settings section includes para­meters for 
your MIDI controller modulation wheel, aftertouch, and velocity.
	
One of the best ways to learn how to program a synthesizer is to open a preset 
that you like and see how the sound is created. Compare two different sounds 
to see which parameters are affecting the sound. And don’t be afraid to fiddle 
with the knobs. It might look vintage, but it won’t break!

Sound Design with Synths 
and Samplers
In This Chapter
▶	Playing the Logic Pro synths
▶	Understanding synthesis fundamentals
▶	Getting classic synth sounds
▶	Modeling acoustic instruments
S

ynthesizers are crucial to popular music, and Logic Pro gives you 
enough synth power to consider selling every keyboard you own. If you 
don’t own any keyboards, you might have just saved thousands of dollars 
by buying Logic Pro. You now own several instruments modeled after classic 
synths as well as some innovative sound design tools that will enable you to 
create sounds you’ve never even imagined. And some of the fun things you’ll 
discover about playing with synthesizers are all the happy accidents you 
encounter along the way.
In this chapter, you discover how to emulate classic synths, create sampler 
instruments, and model acoustic sounds as well as sounds that would be 
hard to create in the analog world. You’ll also learn basic synthesis funda­
mentals to help you navigate these synths and design your own sounds.
Exploring the Logic Pro Synths
With Logic Pro X, you get a whole bunch of instruments that could easily 
replace every synth and keyboard you own. They’re powerful and flexible — 
and they sound amazing. Also, they can seem daunting to program when you 
look at all the controls and parameters that you can adjust. In this section, 
you get a tour of the instrument interfaces and parameters. For a more 
detailed video demonstration of what these synths can do, visit http://
logicstudiotraining.com/lpxfordummies, where I show you how 
synthesizers work and how to use these synths in your music.

	 The software instrument interface opens.
Before you begin the tour of Logic Pro’s fabulous synth collection, it’s impor­
tant to understand some basic synthesis terms:
	
✓	Oscillator: A synthesizer oscillator produces a continuous signal that 
forms the basis for your sound. Oscillators are capable of producing 
several different waveform shapes that have different tonal qualities. 
Oscillators are the most important part of the synthesizer because they 
create the sound that the other synth parameters will shape.
	
✓	Modulation: A static synth sound gains interest when it’s varied in 
some way. Modulation is the process of varying synthesizer parameters. 
Vibrato is a common example of modulation.
	
✓	Filter: Synth sounds are shaped through the use of filters. Filters remove 
parts of the frequency spectrum, allowing you to contour the sound.
	
✓	Envelope: A synth envelope shapes the beginning, middle, and end 
of your sound. The most common envelope adjusts the attack, decay, 
sustain, and release (ADSR). For example, a piano has a fast attack, fast 
decay, medium sustain, and fast release.
	
✓	LFO: A low frequency oscillator (LFO) is a signal, usually below the audi­
ble frequency spectrum, that modulates a signal. LFOs are used to alter 
the original signal in some way. A common use of an LFO is to create 
vibrato.
The EFM1 FM synth
The EFM1 FM synth, shown in Figure 11-1, gets sounds like the 80s classic 
Yamaha DX7, one of the most popular digital synthesizers of all time. The 
EFM1 uses FM (frequency modulation) synthesis to get digital sounds such 
as electric pianos, bells, organs, basses, and other cool and complex sounds. 
The EFM1 is capable of playing 16 simultaneous voices and, unlike the DX7, is 
easy to program.

Figure 11-1: 
The EFM1 
FM synth.
	
To design sounds with FM synthesis, you set the modulator and carrier 
parameters, and then alter the FM intensity. The tuning ratios between the 
modulator and carrier set the harmonic overtones. The FM intensity sets the 
level of the overtones. Here’s a description of the EFM1 parameters:
	
✓	Modulator parameters: The modulator parameters are on the left side 
of the EFM1 interface. Rotate the Harmonic knob to set the modulator 
signal’s tuning ratio. Rotate the Fine tune knob to adjust the harmonics. 
Turn the Wave knob all the way to the left to set the modulator waveform 
to the traditional FM sine wave or anywhere to the right for additional 
waveforms. Rotate the large center FM knob to adjust the FM intensity.
	
✓	Carrier parameters: The carrier parameters are on the right side of the 
EFM1 interface. Rotate the Harmonic knob to set the carrier signal’s 
tuning ratio. Rotate the Fine tune knob to adjust the harmonics. Click 
the Fixed Carrier button to avoid having the carrier modulated by the 
keyboard, pitch bend, or LFO.
	
✓	Global parameters: In the top section of the EFM1, you can set global 
parameters. Click the Transpose field and Tune field to change the 
pitch of the EFM1. Click the Voices field to choose how many notes can 
be played simultaneously. Click the Glide field to set the time it takes 
to slide from one pitch to another, also known as portamento. Click the 
Unison button to layer voices and make the sound richer, which also 
reduces by half the number of voices that can be played simultaneously.
	
✓	Modulation parameters: In the center of the EFM1 are modulation enve­
lope sliders that set the attack, decay, sustain, and release (ADSR) of 
the sound. Rotate the Modulator Pitch knob to set how the modulation 
envelope affects the pitch. Rotate the FM Depth knob to set how the 
modulation envelope affects the FM intensity. Rotate the LFO knob to set 
how much the LFO modulates the FM intensity or the pitch. Rotate the 
Rate knob to set the speed of the LFO.

✓	Output parameters: The bottom half of the EFM1 is dedicated to output 
parameters. Rotate the Sub Osc Level knob to increase the bass response. 
Rotate the Stereo Detune knob to add a chorus effect to the sound. Rotate 
the Velocity knob to set the velocity sensitivity in response to your MIDI 
controller. Rotate the Main Level knob to adjust the overall volume. Adjust 
the Volume Envelope sliders to set the ADSR of the sound.
	
Click the Randomize button at the bottom right of the EFM1 interface to 
create random sounds. Adjust the amount of randomization by clicking the 
Randomize field and setting the percent of randomization. If you like crazy 
digital sounds, 100 percent randomization is your best friend.
The ES1 subtractive synth
The ES1 synthesizer, shown in Figure 11-2, creates sounds by using subtrac­
tive synthesis, in which you start with an oscillator and a suboscillator and 
then subtract parts of the sound to shape it. The ES1 is modeled after classic 
analog synths and is great at creating basses, leads, pads, and even percus­
sion sounds.

 Chapter 11: Sound Design with Synths and Samplers
A description of the ES1 parameters follows:
	
✓	Oscillator parameters: The left half of the ES1 interface gives you the 
oscillator parameters that define your basic sound. Click the buttons 
on the left to choose the octave. Rotate the Wave knob to set the oscil­
lator waveform. Rotate the Sub knob to set the suboscillator waveform. 
Adjust the Mix slider to set the mix between the two oscillators.
	
✓	Filter parameters: The center section of the ES1 filters the two oscil­
lator waveforms. Adjust the Cutoff slider to set the cutoff frequency of 
the low-pass filter. Adjust the Resonance slider to set the quality of the 
frequencies around the cutoff frequency. Click one of the four Slope but­
tons to choose how extreme the low-pass filter affects the signal. Adjust 
the Drive slider to affect the resonance setting and to overdrive the 
filter. Adjust the Key slider to set how the pitch adjusts the filter. Adjust 
the ADSR via Velocity slider to set how the filter is affected by note 
velocity.
	
✓	Amplifier parameters: The right sections of the ES1 adjust the volume 
level and performance. Adjust the Level via Velocity slider to set how 
the volume is affected by note velocity. Click the Amplifier Envelope but­
tons to set how the ADSR envelope affects the volume.
	
✓	Modulation parameters: The largest section of the dark-green area of 
the ES1 adjusts how the sound is modulated. The Glide parameter sets 
the speed of the portamento. Rotate the Wave and Rate knobs to set 
how the Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO) stimulates the sound over time. 
The Modulation Envelope sets how the modulation fades in or out. The 
Router parameters set the targets of the LFO and Modulation Envelope.
	
✓	Envelope parameters: The far right section of the dark-green area 
adjusts the ADSR envelope. Use the sliders to set the time of the attack, 
decay, sustain, and release.
	
✓	Global parameters: The bottom row of parameters controls the ES1 
global parameters. Click the Tune field to adjust the overall tuning. Click 
the Analog field to introduce random changes to the tuning and cutoff 
frequency, similar to an analog circuit that changes due to heat and age. 
Click the Bender Range to adjust the amount of pitch bend. Click the 
Out Level to adjust the overall volume. Click the Voices field to set the 
number of voices the ES1 can play simultaneously. Click the Chorus field 
to choose the type of built-in chorus effect that will thicken the sound.
The ES1 is a great instrument to use for getting the feel of analog synthesis. 
Many of the synths that follow have similar parameters. Getting the hang of 
setting oscillator waveforms, filters, envelopes, and modulators will help you 
take command of the synths and design your own sounds.
	
You don’t have to be a programming genius to get great sounds out of Logic 
Pro’s synthesizers. Every synth comes with a menu of presets at the top of the 
interface. Load a sound you like, twist some knobs, and have some fun.

The ES2 hybrid synth
The ES2, shown in Figure 11-3, is like a combined EFM1 and ES1 synth plus 
another type of synthesis called wavetable synthesis. A wavetable is made 
up of many different waveforms that evolve from one to another or blend at 
once, creating complex digital sounds. Although the ES2 can produce sounds 
similar to the EFM1 and ES1, it shines at creating pads, sonic textures, and 
synthetic sounds that evolve over time.
	
Figure 11-3: 
The ES2 
hybrid 
synth.
	
I skip many of the parameters that are similar to the ES1 and EFM1 and focus 
on the unique features of the ES2:
	
✓	Oscillator parameters: The three numbered oscillators on the upper-left 
side of the ES2 interface choose the basic sound. The triangle-shaped 
area to the right of the three oscillators blends them together.
	
✓	Filter parameters: The round section in the center of the ES2 adjusts the 
filters that shape your synth sound.
	
✓	Amplifier parameters: The top-right section contains the ES2 volume level. 
You can add a sine wave to the output section using the Sine Level knob.
	
✓	Effects parameters: To the right of the ES2 parameters are several built-in 
effects, including distortion and chorus, as well as a flanger and a phaser.
                           

179
 Chapter 11: Sound Design with Synths and Samplers
	
✓	Planar pad: The X/Y pad to the right of the amplifier parameters can 
control two parameters simultaneously. The planar pad parameters are 
chosen in the modulation router or vector envelope.
	
✓	Modulation router and vector envelope parameters: The dark-blue strip 
of the ES2 controls the modulation sources and targets as well as the 
vector envelope generator. You can toggle between the modulation router 
and vector envelope using the Router and Vector buttons on the right.
	
✓	Modulation parameters: Below the modulation router and vector enve­
lope parameters are the modulation parameters. Adjust the two LFOs 
and three envelopes to modulate the ES2 modulation targets. You set the 
modulation sources and targets in the modulation router.
	
✓	Macro controls and controller assignment parameters: The bottom 
strip of buttons and knobs are where you set the macro controls and 
MIDI controller assignments. Click the Macro or MIDI button to toggle 
between the two types of controls. Click the Macro Only button to hide 
all ES2 parameters except the preprogrammed macro controls, which 
are useful when you went to adjust the ES2 sounds globally. The MIDI 
controller assignments allow you to map controls on your MIDI control­
ler to parameters of the ES2.
	
✓	Global parameters: Found above the filter parameters and to the left of 
the oscillator parameters are the ES2 global parameters. You can tune 
the instrument, set the number of voices, adjust the portamento speed, 
and more.
	
The ES2 hybrid synth can be used in surround mode to pan your sound 
throughout the surround spectrum if you’re monitoring your project in sur­
round sound. Working in surround sound is beyond the scope of this book, 
but I thought you would want to know that the Logic Pro designers have 
seemingly thought of everything. To get to the surround parameters, click the 
disclosure triangle at the bottom of the ES2 interface to display the advanced 
parameters.
The ES E ensemble synth
The ES E synth, shown in Figure 11-4, is a lightweight, eight-voice subtractive 
synth. The E in its name stands for ensemble, and the ES E is great for warm 
pads such as analog brass and strings. Best of all, it’s much easier to program 
than the ES1 or ES2.

Figure 11-4: 
The ES E 
ensemble 
synth.
	
Here’s a description of the ES E parameters:
	
✓	Oscillator parameters: The left side of the ES E interface adjusts the 
oscillator parameters. Click the buttons on the far left to choose the 
octave of your sound. Rotate the Wave knob all the way to the left to 
generate a sawtooth wave, which is bright with strong odd and even har­
monics and excels at generating rich pads. The rest of the wave range 
generates pulse waves, which are hollow sounding with strong odd har­
monics and can create excellent reedy sounds such as woodwinds.
	
✓	LFO parameters: The knobs below the wave parameter adjust the LFO 
settings. The LFO modulates the oscillator waveform. Rotate the Vibrato/
PWM (pulse wave modulation) knob to set the modulation intensity. 
Rotate the Speed knob to set the LFO speed.
	
✓	Filter parameters: To the right of the oscillator and LFO parameters are the 
low-pass filter parameters. A low-pass filter allows low frequencies to pass 
through while reducing the higher frequencies. Rotate the Cutoff knob to 
set the cutoff frequency, and rotate the Resonance knob to raise or lower 
the frequencies around the cutoff frequency. Rotate the Attack/Release 
Intensity knob to adjust how the envelope generator affects the filter. 
Rotate the Velocity Filter knob to adjust how velocity affects the filter.
	
✓	Envelope parameters: To the right of the filter parameters are the 
envelope parameters. Adjust the Attack and Release sliders to set 
the level of your sound over time. A high attack setting will result in a 
more immediate sound, and a lower setting will result in a slow fade up 
to the final volume. A high release setting will cause the sound to slowly 
fade when you release the key, and a lower setting will cause the sound 
to fade quickly.
	
✓	Output parameters: To the right of the envelope parameters are the 
output parameters. Rotate the Volume knob to adjust the overall 
ESE volume. Rotate the Velocity Volume knob to adjust the velocity 
sensitivity.
                           

181
 Chapter 11: Sound Design with Synths and Samplers
	
✓	Effects parameters: To the right of the envelope parameters, you can 
choose a built-in effect. Choose between Chorus I, Chorus II, and Ensemble 
to thicken your sound.
The ES M mono synth
The ES M, shown in Figure 11-5, is another lightweight subtractive synth. The 
M stands for mono, which means the ES M can play only one note at a time. 
Monophonic synths such as the ES M are perfect for bass and lead sounds. 
Like the ES E, the ES M is simple to program and features a stripped-down 
set of controls. Both the ES E and ES M are great instruments for learning the 
basics of synthesis.
	
Figure 11-5: 
The ES M 
monophonic 
synth.
	
A description of the ES M parameters follows:
	
✓	Oscillator parameters: The left side of the ES M adjusts the oscillator 
parameters. Click the numbered buttons on the far left to choose the 
octave. Rotate the Mix knob all the way to the left to select a sawtooth 
wave and all the way to the right to select a rectangular wave. Rotate the 
Mix knob between the two positions to mix the sawtooth and rectangu­
lar waves. Rectangular waves, like pulse waves, are reedy and nasal and 
great for synth bass sounds. Rotate the Glide knob to adjust the speed of 
the portamento.
	
✓	Filter parameters: To the right of the oscillator parameters are the filter 
parameters. Rotate the Cutoff knob to adjust the cutoff frequency of 
the low-pass filter. Rotate the Resonance knob to boost or cut the fre­
quencies around the cutoff frequency. Rotate the Filter Intensity knob 
to adjust how the envelope generator modulates the cutoff frequency. 
Rotate the Filter Decay knob to adjust the filter envelope decay time. 
Rotate the Filter Velocity knob to adjust how velocity affects the filter.
                           

182
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
	
✓	Volume parameters: To the lower right of the filter parameters are 
the output parameters. Rotate the Volume knob to adjust the overall 
volume. Rotate the Volume Decay knob to adjust how the sound decays 
over time. Rotate the Volume Velocity knob to adjust how volume 
responds to velocity. Rotate the Overdrive knob to add distortion to 
your sound.
	
Click the disclosure triangle at the bottom of the interface to view the 
extended parameters. You can adjust the pitch bend amount and fine-tuning in 
this area.
The ES P poly synth
The ES P, shown in Figure 11-6, is another lightweight subtractive synth. The 
P stands for polyphonic; you can play eight voices at once. The ES P is mod­
eled after classic 80s synths and does a great job of creating analog pads, 
bass, and brass sounds.
	
Figure 11-6: 
The ES P 
polyphonic 
synth.
	
Here’s a description of the ES P parameters:
	
✓	Oscillator parameters: The left side of the ES P adjusts the oscillator 
parameters. Click the numbered buttons to choose the octave. The 
Oscillator sliders are used to mix the six oscillators. From left to right, 
you can set the level of a triangle wave, sawtooth wave, rectangle wave, 
suboscillator -1 (one octave below), suboscillator -2 (two octaves 
below), and noise generator.
	
✓	LFO parameters: To the right of the oscillator parameters are the LFO 
parameters. Rotate the Vibrato/Wah knob to adjust the amount of 
vibrato or wah-wah effect. Rotate the Speed knob to adjust the speed of 
the vibrato or wah.
                           

183
 Chapter 11: Sound Design with Synths and Samplers
	
✓	Filter parameters: To the right of the LFO parameters are the filter 
parameters. Rotate the Frequency knob to set the cutoff frequency of 
the low-pass filter. Rotate the Resonance knob to boost or cut the fre­
quencies around the cutoff frequency. Click the 1/3, 2/3, or 3/3 buttons 
to adjust how the pitch affects the cutoff frequency modulation. Rotate 
the ADSR Intensity knob to adjust how the envelope generator affects 
the cutoff frequency modulation. Rotate the Velocity Filter knob to set 
how velocity affects the filter.
	
✓	Volume parameters: To the lower right of the filter parameters are 
the volume parameters. Rotate the Volume knob to adjust the overall 
volume. Rotate the Velocity Volume knob to adjust how the velocity 
affects the volume. Lower levels mimic classic synthesizers without 
velocity-sensitive keyboards; higher levels make notes louder if the key 
is struck harder.
	
✓	Envelope parameters: To the right of the volume parameters are the 
envelope parameters. Adjust the attack, decay, sustain, and release 
parameters (ADSR) to adjust the ES P envelope.
	
✓	Effects parameters: To the right of the envelope parameters are the 
effects parameters. Rotate the Chorus knob to the right to add chorus 
and thicken your sound. Rotate the Overdrive knob to the right to add 
distortion.
The EVOC 20 poly synth vocoder
The EVOC 20 poly synth, shown in Figure 11-7, is a vocoder and a 20-voice 
synthesizer. A vocoder (voice encoder) takes an incoming audio signal, typi­
cally a voice, and applies this signal to the synthesizer, creating a hybrid 
vocal synthesizer. However, a voice isn’t the only thing you can use as an 
input. You could input a drum loop or an instrument into the synthesizer or 
run the synth without any input as a stand-alone synthesizer.
	
Figure 11-7: 
The EVOC 
20 vocoder 
synth.
	
                           

184
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
To use the EVOC 20 PS as a classic vocoder, do the following:
	
1.	On the Side Chain menu in the EVOC 20 PS plug-in header, choose the 
input source.
	
	 The source can be a live input, an audio track, or a bus. The classic 
vocoder effect uses a live input or prerecorded vocal track.
	
2.	Mute the input source so you hear only the output from the EVOC 
20 PS.
	
3.	Play your MIDI controller simultaneously with the input source.
	
	 The EVOC 20 PS synthesizes your input source.
Here’s a brief description of a couple important EVOC 20 PS parameters:
	
✓	Side-chain analysis parameters: The upper-left area of the EVOC 20 PS 
adjusts the side-chain parameters. Rotate the Attack knob to set how 
fast or slow the synth reacts to the beginning of the input signal. Rotate 
the Release knob to adjust how fast or slow the synth reacts to the end 
of the input signal. Click the Freeze button to hold the current input 
signal indefinitely.
	
✓	U/V detection parameters: The right side of the EVOC 20 PS adjusts the 
U/V (unvoiced/voiced) detection parameters. The human voice is made 
up of voiced sounds such as vowels and unvoiced sounds such as plo­
sives, fricatives, and nasals. Rotate the Sensitivity knob to adjust how 
sensitive the EVOC 20 PS is to voiced and unvoiced input signals. Click 
the Mode field to choose how unvoiced sounds are synthesized. Rotate 
the Level knob to adjust the volume of the unvoiced content.
	
You’ll get great results if your input source is a constant volume with lots of 
high-frequency content. Be sure that your input source’s volume doesn’t vary 
too much. You can also EQ the input source to boost the high-frequency con­
tent. You learn how to EQ signals in Chapter 16.
Sampling with the EXS24 Sampler
The EXS24 sampler, shown in Figure 11-8, plays audio files known as samples. 
Samplers are useful for re-creating acoustic instruments because you’re 
playing back recorded audio files. But you can also sample synthetic sounds 
or mangle acoustic samples until they’re no longer recognizable to create 
unique sounds.
                           

185
 Chapter 11: Sound Design with Synths and Samplers
	
Figure 11-8: 
The EXS24 
sampler.
	
In this section, you learn how to use the EXS24, import third-party sample 
libraries, create your own sampler instruments, and much more.
Importing sample libraries
The EXS24 comes with an enormous library of sampler instruments, but you 
can also import third-party sample libraries. The EXS24 has a large user base, 
so finding sample providers online isn’t difficult. In addition to the native 
EXS24 sampler instrument format, you can import SoundFont2, DLS, and 
Gigasampler files.
To import a third-party sample library, follow these steps:
	
1.	Copy the sample files to a subfolder of your choosing in any of the fol­
lowing locations:
Macintosh HD/Users/<USERNAME>/Music/Audio Music Apps/
Sampler Instruments/
Macintosh HD/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application 
Support/Logic/Sampler Instruments/
Macintosh HD/Library/Application Support/Logic/Sampler 
Instruments/
	
2.	At the top of the EXS24 interface, click the Sampler Instruments menu 
and choose Refresh Menu.
	
	 Your imported sampler instrument appears on the menu, so that you 
can select and open it.
                           

186
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
Converting regions to sampler instruments
You can create your own sampler instrument from any audio region in your 
project. For example, you can take a drum loop or an instrument riff and slice 
it into several pieces that you can play with your MIDI controller. You can 
also trigger the entire region as a loop or a one-shot sample, which means 
it plays just once instead of repeating. To convert audio regions to sampler 
instruments, do the following:
	
1.	Select an audio region in your project.
	
2.	Control-click the region and choose Convert➪Convert Regions to New 
Sampler Track (or press Control-E).
	
	 The Convert Regions to New Sampler Track dialog opens.
	
3.	Select Create Zones from Regions or Create Zones from Transient 
Markers.
	
	 Select Regions to create a loop or one-shot sample. Select Transient 
Markers to slice the region into several different samples that you can 
trigger with your MIDI controller.
	
4.	Name the instrument and select the note trigger range.
	
	 The note trigger range defines the MIDI notes that will trigger the 
samples.
	
5.	Click OK.
	
	 A new software instrument track is added to the track list loaded with 
the EXS24. A MIDI region containing the trigger notes is also added to 
the tracks area.
	
If you convert a drumbeat to a sampler instrument, you can play the beat 
chromatically with your MIDI controller. A cool trick is to rearrange parts of 
the beat to create new beats or drum fills. If you converted an instrument part 
to a sampler instrument, you can rearrange the part and come up with new 
instrument parts. You could also sample your boss saying, “No one leave until 
the work is done” and rearrange it to say, “The work is done. Leave.”
Controlling sample parameters
Just like the other Logic Pro synthesizers, EXS24 sounds can be shaped by 
filters and modulation. Here’s a brief description of some EXS24 parameters:
                           

187
 Chapter 11: Sound Design with Synths and Samplers
	
✓	Global parameters: The top-left green section and top row of param­
eters are where you set the EXS24 global parameters. Click the Legato, 
Mono, or Poly button to change the keyboard mode. Double-click the 
Voices field to set the maximum number of notes that the EXS24 can 
play at a time. Click the Unison button to play many slightly detuned 
voices at once to emulate a thick and classic synth sound. Double-click 
the Velocity Offset field to increase or decrease the incoming velocity 
signals from your MIDI controller. Click the Hold Via field to change the 
default MIDI controller used to trigger the sustain pedal.
	
✓	Pitch parameters: To the right of the global parameters are the EXS24 
pitch parameters. In this section, you can transpose and fine-tune the 
instrument. You can adjust the amount of pitch bend and introduce 
random pitch changes to emulate analog synthesizers or live string play­
ers. Adjust the Glide slider to set the speed of the portamento effect.
	
✓	Filter parameters: Below the sampler instrument menu are the EXS24 
filter parameters. Click the buttons at the bottom of the filter section to 
choose the type of filter. Rotate the Cutoff and Resonance knobs to set 
the filter parameters.
	
✓	Output parameters: To the right of the filter parameters are the EXS24 
output parameters. Rotate the Volume knob to set the overall volume. 
Adjust the Level Via Velocity slider to set how velocity affects the 
volume. Double-click the Key Scale field to set how volume is affected 
by pitch. Positive values increase the level of higher notes, emulating 
acoustic instruments.
	
✓	Modulation router: The center dark-blue strip of controls is where you 
set the EXS24 modulation sources and targets.
	
✓	LFO parameters: The bottom-left section of the EXS24 is where you set 
the parameters of the three LFOs.
	
✓	Envelope parameters: To the right of the LFO parameters are the envelope 
parameters. Envelope 1 controls the filter while Envelope 2 controls the 
volume level.
	
✓	EXS24 preferences: Click the Options button on the upper-right corner 
of the EXS24 to open the Options menu. Choose Preferences on the 
Options menu to open the Sampler Preferences window, shown in 
Figure 11-9. In this window, you can choose to search samples on your 
local hard drive, external hard drives, or all hard drives connected to 
your computer.

Editing sampled instruments
There may come a time when you want to create your own sampler instru­
ments or edit the current instrument. A sampler instrument is made up 
of zones and groups. A zone is the location of a single sample, whereas 
a group can contain many zones. You can edit all the zones in the group 
simultaneously.
To visualize how zones and groups fit together, consider a piano sampler 
instrument. Each piano key is sampled at multiple velocity levels. These sam­
pled notes (zones) are grouped according to their velocity level for organiza­
tion and so the group can be edited as a whole. You can have a group that 
contains loud samples and a group that contains quiet samples, for example, 
and edit each group and all the zones in it.
To open the instrument editor, which is shown in Figure 11-10, click the Edit 
button at the top right of the EXS24 interface. The instrument editor has two 
views, zones and groups, which can be accessed by clicking the buttons at 
the top left of the Instrument Editor window. On the Instrument drop-down 
menu at the top of the interface, you can save, rename, and create new instru­
ments. You can also create zones and groups, as well as show and hide para­
meters on the View menu. Double-clicking the audio file names will open the 
samples in the Logic Pro audio file editor. (For more on the audio file editor, 
see Chapter 14).

Modeling Sounds Using Sculpture
Sculpture, shown in Figure 11-11, is a component-modeling synthesizer, which 
creates virtual models of the components of acoustic instruments, such as 
the necks and bodies of string instruments as well as the strings themselves. 
Sculpture can also model the location of these components, so you can put 
them indoors, outdoors, or in synthetic locations. Sculpture can also synthe­
size sounds much like the other Logic Pro synths described in this chapter.

Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
In this section, you learn how to model instruments and synthesize sounds 
with Sculpture.
Understanding sound modeling
Sound modeling uses math to simulate the stimulation of physical objects. 
To create a complete sound model, the math has to take into consideration 
the object being stimulated as well as the object doing the stimulating. The 
object being stimulated can have many components, such as a guitar string, a 
guitar neck, and a guitar body.
Sculpture gives you the following parameters for detailed sound modeling.
	
✓	String: In Sculpture, the stimulated component is called a string. The 
string parameters are adjusted in the round Material pad in the center 
of the interface. You can move the puck in the Material pad to change 
the string parameters to nylon, wood, steel, or gloss. The left/right axis 
adjusts the stiffness of the material. The up/down access adjusts inner 
loss (dampening caused by the string material). You also have sliders 
to adjust the resolution, tension modulation, and media loss (string 
dampening due to the surrounding environment). Click the buttons at 
the bottom of the Material pad to show or hide the Keyscale and Release 
parameters. Keyscale changes how the string reacts depending on the 
pitch, and Release affects how the string behaves when released.
	
✓	Objects: The components that stimulate the string are called objects 
in Sculpture. Objects are adjusted in the left side of the interface, and 
three objects are available. Click the numbered object buttons to turn 
an object on or off. One object must be selected for the string to sound 
when played. Click the object Type buttons to choose different materi­
als and methods of stimulating the string. Each object includes a knob 
to adjust the object’s strength and sliders to adjust the timbre, velocity 
sensitivity, and variation. Click the Gate mode buttons to set the object 
to stimulate the string at Key On, Always, or Key Off.
	
✓	Pickups: Sculpture uses two pickups to take the sound generated by the 
objects and string and input that signal into the rest of Sculpture’s signal 
processing. Pickups are analogous to a guitar’s pickups. Adjust the 
pickup properties in the cylindrical area in the Object section. Drag the 
pickup A and B sliders at the top and bottom of the cylinder to adjust 
the pickup position. Drag the numbered object sliders to adjust the posi­
tion of the objects in relation to the pickups.
	
✓	Body: Change the body type Sculpture uses to shape the sound in the 
lower-right area of the interface. Click the Model button to choose the 
body type. Click the Body EQ button to turn the entire body parameter on 
or off. Adjust the intensity, shift, and stretch of the body using the knobs.

 Chapter 11: Sound Design with Synths and Samplers
Exploring the Sculpture interface
In addition to component-modeling parameters, Sculpture can filter and mod­
ulate your sound. Plus, you can add built-in effects. Here’s a brief description 
of some Sculpture parameters:
	
✓	Global parameters: The buttons and input fields across the top of the 
Sculpture interface are global parameters. Click the Glide Time field 
to adjust the portamento speed. Click the Tune field to fine-tune the 
instrument. Click the Warmth field to slightly detune the voices and 
thicken the tone. Click the Transpose field to transpose the instrument 
in octaves. To the right side of the global parameters are the Voices field 
and Keyboard Mode buttons. The Voices field sets the number of voices 
that can be played simultaneously. Click the Keyboard Mode buttons to 
select Polyphonic, Monophonic, or Legato. In monophonic mode, the 
attack is always retriggered. In legato mode, notes aren’t retriggered 
unless you release the key before playing the next key.
	
✓	Waveshaper parameters: Directly above the string material parameters 
are the waveshaper parameters. The waveshaper adds nonlinear curves 
to your sound and can add rich saturation or raw distortion. Click the 
Type pop-up menu to choose the waveshaper curve. Rotate the Input 
Scale knob to raise or lower the input signal. Rotate the Variation knob 
to alter the shape.
	
✓	Filter parameters: Directly below the string material parameters are the 
filter parameters. Click the filter type buttons to select the filter mode. 
Rotate the Cutoff and Frequency knob to adjust the filter. Rotate the Key 
Tracking knob to adjust how the filters respond to the key that’s played. 
Acoustic sounds generally have mellower low notes and brighter high 
notes, and key tracking allows the filter to respond to the pitch. Rotate 
the Velocity Sensitivity knob to adjust how velocity affects the filter. 
A harder velocity will usually make an acoustic sound brighter, and a 
higher value will give you more velocity sensitivity.
	
✓	Modulation parameters: At the bottom-left section of the interface are the 
modulation parameters. In addition to common LFO, vibrato, and envelope 
modulation sources, Sculpture provides some unique ways to modulate 
your sound and create constantly evolving textures to make your sound 
more expressive. Click the modulation type buttons at the bottom to 
open the parameters for that modulation type. The two Jitter modulators 
provide continuous and random alterations of your sound. The Velocity/
Note On Random parameters can give your sound acoustic realism by 
emulating the subtle changes a musician would make while playing.
                           

192
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
	
✓	Output parameters: To the far right of the string material parameters are 
the output parameters. The Level knob adjusts the overall volume. Click 
the Level Limiter mode buttons to process the volume level depending 
on the mode. Mono mode limits all the voices; Poly mode limits each 
voice separately.
	
✓	Morph parameters: Directly below the filter parameters are the morph 
parameters. Morphable parameters can be stored in a point in the 
Morph pad, allowing you to smoothly change the sound over time. All 
morphable parameters are indicated by orange values, rather than blue 
or turquoise values. The morph parameters are beyond the scope of 
this book, but you can get a free Sculpture tutorial by visiting http://
logicstudiotraining.com/lpxfordummies.
	
✓	Delay parameters: The upper-right section of the Sculpture interface is 
dedicated to the delay parameters. The delay effect copies the sound 
and repeats it based on the parameters you choose. Click the Delay 
button to turn on the delay effect. Drag the Delay Time slider to choose 
when the sound will repeat. Rotate the Wet Level knob to adjust the 
volume of the delay. Rotate the Feedback knob to adjust how many 
times the delay will repeat.
	
✓	MIDI controller parameters: At the very bottom of the Sculpture inter­
face are the MIDI controller parameters. Click the MIDI controller name 
pop-up menu to choose the MIDI controller, or select Learn to listen for 
the next MIDI controller that you touch.
	
Many of the presets on the Logic Pro instruments have their overall volume 
set to zero, which means it neither boosts nor cuts the signal. Consequently, 
the software instruments can be very loud when you first load them. It’s a 
good idea to find the overall volume of these instruments and turn it down so 
you aren’t in danger of clipping the signal. Also, you will get a better balance 
between the other tracks in your project if the instruments aren’t too loud.
With all these software instruments to play with, you can have an endless 
amount of fun. One of the joys of playing synths is how they can surprise and 
delight you with their unique personalities. Just like getting to know a good 
friend, listen to your synth and let it tell you its story. In time, you and your 
synths will become close musical partners.

I

magine standing in front of a full fifty-piece orchestra, conducting your 
own score. The music builds, section by section, into a glorious peak. You 
pull the intensity down gracefully and a lone trumpet plays a short, plaintive 
motif over a bed of lush strings. A tear falls in the audience. And then silence, 
before a slow roar of applause overtakes the concert hall. Flowers are thrown 
and the crowd begins chanting, “Encore!”
You may have to imagine the applause and chanting. But Logic Pro will pro­
vide the orchestra.
Orchestral instruments will never go out of style. An orchestra is Hollywood’s 
best friend. Plus, Logic Pro shines at film scoring. You learn how to import 
video in Chapter 8. In this chapter, you discover how to set up an orchestra 
and score your own soundtrack.
A video isn’t required to compose with an orchestra. But if you’d like to 
practice scoring to video, an online search for royalty-free video will give you 
something to import into your project.
One giant reason why Logic Pro is great at orchestration is its music notation 
capabilities. The notation displayed in the score editor is separate from the 
MIDI events, so the score can look perfect even if the playing isn’t. You can 
view the score layout in Logic Pro and print lead sheets for the performers 
and the complete orchestral score for the conductor. If you read music, you’ll 
find that the score editor is a great place to input music, especially if you’re 
transcribing a score from sheet music. The Project Gutenberg online library 
has scores that you can input for practice or fun.

Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
Building an Orchestral Template
Logic Pro X comes with an enormous selection of sampled orchestral instru­
ments. These sophisticated samples are available as patches in the library. 
Most of the patches include the Space Designer plug-in, which recreates 
acoustic environments, so you have exceptional control over the sound of 
your orchestra.
Note: You may already have an orchestral template installed with Logic Pro X. 
For many users, the orchestral template isn’t included in the installation, even 
when they download the additional content (as you discover later in this sec­
tion). I want to teach you how to create an orchestral template so that you can 
create your own personalized template and be encouraged to experiment with 
the orchestra. This template, along with a video guide, is available at http://
logicstudiotraining.com/lpxfordummies.
Setting up an orchestral template will save you time when inspiration strikes. 
Create the template once and then use it over and over again. To begin, 
create a new empty project:
	
1.	Choose File➪New from Template (⌘-N).
	
	 The template chooser window opens, as shown in Figure 12-1.
	
2.	In the template chooser, select the Empty Project template.

3.	In the Details area, select the project settings you want.
	
	 If the Details area is closed, click the disclosure triangle to reveal the 
project settings.
	
4.	Click the Choose button.
	
	 The new tracks dialog appears.
	
5.	Select the Software Instrument option and enter the number of tracks 
you want to create.
	
	 For this example, enter 32 in the number of tracks field. You’ll be able to 
fit a full orchestra on 32 tracks with a few tracks to spare.
	
6.	Click the Create button.
	
	 The main window of your new project opens.
Choosing your orchestral instruments
Orchestras come in lots of shapes and sizes. The Logic Pro orchestral 
patches can deliver the most common variations. And of course you’re not 
limited to using acoustic samples exclusively. You can mix an orchestra with 
electronic instruments or a rock band, for example.
	
You must download additional content to take advantage of orchestral patches. 
Choose Logic Pro X➪Download Additional Content. Select the Orchestral and 
Piano check boxes in the Additional Content window, as shown in Figure 12-2, 
and click Install. After your patches have finished installing, you can find them 
in the library by choosing View➪Show Library (Y).

196
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
Before you load your tracks with patches, decide on the orchestra you want. 
Following is a list of common orchestrations with their patch names:
	
✓	Full orchestra: A full orchestra consists of woodwinds, brass, per­
cussion, harp, piano, and strings. You can load the following patch 
names: Piccolo, Flutes, Oboe, English Horn, Clarinets, Bassoon Solo, 
French Horns, Trumpets, Trombones, Tuba, Timpani, Orchestral Kit, 
Glockenspiel, Harp, Grand Piano, Violins 1, Violins 2, Violas, Cellos, and 
Basses.
	
✓	String orchestra: A string orchestra consists of strings, harp, piano, and 
percussion. You can load the following patch names: Violins 1, Violins 2, 
Violas, Cellos, Basses, Harp, Grand Piano, Timpani, and Orchestral Kit.
	
✓	Concert band: A concert band consists of woodwinds, brass, harp, 
piano, and percussion. You can load the following patch names: Piccolo, 
Flutes, Oboe, English Horn, Clarinets, Bassoon Solo, Saxophone, French 
Horns, Trumpets, Trombones, Tuba, Glockenspiel, Harp, Grand Piano, 
Timpani, and Orchestral Kit.
	
Logic Pro X comes with several different grand piano patches, so you can 
choose between a Yamaha, a Boesendorfer, or a Steinway grand piano. Many 
orchestral patches also have solo patches in addition to the ensemble patches, 
such as the French Horn, Clarinet, and Flute. And if you don’t want to work 
with individual instruments and would rather compose with full sections, you 
can use the Full Brass and Full Strings patch as well as several genre-specific 
patches such as Romance Strings, Cinema Strings, and Pop Strings.
Choosing appropriate staff styles
Staff styles are used to store information about how a region should be dis­
played in the score editor. Orchestral instruments are traditionally associated 
with a specific clef type and transposition, for example. Choosing a staff style 
allows you to quickly adjust how a region or entire track will look.
The orchestral patches in your library already have the appropriate staff 
style saved with the patch. However, you can easily change the staff style of a 
track by following these steps:
	
1.	Select the track.
	
2.	Open the inspector by choosing View➪Show Inspector (I).
	
	 The inspector opens on the left side of the main window.
                           

197
 Chapter 12: Conducting a Virtual Orchestra
	
3.	Open the track inspector pane, shown in Figure 12-3, by clicking the 
disclosure triangle.
	
4.	In the Staff Style drop-down list, select the style.
	
	 The track will use the new staff style in the score editor.
	
Figure 12-3: 
The track 
inspector.
	
A great example of when you might want to change the staff style is with the 
Trumpets patch. The staff style that loads with the Trumpets patch is trans­
posed for Bb trumpet, which means the trumpet notation is transposed up 
two semitones. If you compose and orchestrate in the score editor, you might 
want to switch between the instrument’s staff style to a style with no trans­
position. You can compose more quickly when you don’t have to continually 
do the mental transposition in the score editor. To edit the staff style, simply 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the track.
	
2.	Choose View➪Show Editor (E).
	
	 The editor window opens at the bottom of the tracks area.
	
3.	Click the Score tab to display the score editor.
	
4.	On the score editor menu, choose Layout➪Show Staff Styles.
	
	 The staff styles window opens, as shown in Figure 12-4.
	
5.	In the Transpose field, drag your cursor up or down to change the value.
	
	 The score editor instantly updates to the new transposition for all tracks 
that use the same staff style.

Saving your orchestral template
With all your patches loaded, you could save your project as a template by 
choosing File➪Save as Template. But there’s more you can do to make this 
template a composer’s playground. Because your work as a composer is 
made up of many different tasks, you can create screensets dedicated to spe­
cific workflows. Here are some screenset ideas to help you compose faster:
	
✓	Choose instruments and input parts. In the beginning of a project, you 
spend a lot of time auditioning different instrument patches. Open the 
library (Y) to make patch selections fast. The tracks area will already be 
open, enabling you to record new regions and select tracks. If you also 
open the editor (E), you’ll be able to quickly input notes into the piano 
roll, score, or step editor.
	
✓	Perform parts with smart controls. When you record, you need to cap­
ture your best performance. Open the smart controls (B) to have imme­
diate control over the different articulations of these orchestral patches.
	
✓	Set the project key and tempo. If you’re composing to video, you need 
regular access to the global tracks to time your music to the video. 
Open the score editor in a new window (⌘-5) and display the global 
tracks (G). This view gives you a score for referencing your music and 
the global tracks for inputting tempo and key changes (for details, see 
Chapter 4).
	
✓	View the score editor in linear view. See the entire score scroll in 
front of you. Open the score editor in a new window (⌘-5), and choose 
View➪View Mode➪Linear View on the score editor menu. Input notes in 
the score editor by using the pencil tool.
                           

199
 Chapter 12: Conducting a Virtual Orchestra
	
✓	Edit MIDI. Adjusting note lengths and velocities is fast and easy in the 
piano roll editor. A giant piano roll editor in the tracks area makes MIDI 
editing simple. (To find out how to edit MIDI, see Chapter 15.)
	
✓	Engrave music. Similar to linear view, the score editor looks beautiful 
in page view, as shown in Figure 12-5. Open the score editor in a new 
window and select View➪View Mode➪Page View. From this view, you 
can add ornaments and text from the part box in the inspector (I) and 
print your score for the musicians and conductor.
	
✓	Produce the final mix. You adjust the levels of the individual instru­
ments in the mixer. Open the mixer in a new window (⌘-2) and make it 
as big as you can. You learn all about the mixer in Chapter 16.
	
✓	View video. If you have a video imported into your project, choose 
View➪Show Movie Window. Watch the movie and play what you see. 
Sound simple? Logic Pro does its best to make it so.
	
✓	Use project notes. If you work with a team, documenting your work 
is a must. Open the project notes by choosing View➪Show Note Pads 
(Option-⌘-P). In the project notes, create a log of important changes, 
instructions, lyrics, or anything else you want to remember later.
	
Figure 12-5: 
Score editor 
page view.
	
When you have these screensets set up the way you like, choose Lock on the 
screenset menu. After the screensets are locked, you can make changes to 
the view as much as you like but your original settings will be recalled when 
you choose the screenset.
	
You’ve already learned how to save your project as a template, but you can 
also save your entire orchestra as a patch. First, select all the tracks and 
create a summing track stack (as described in Chapter 4). Save the track stack 
as a patch, and you’ll be able to load your orchestra into any project.

Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
Performing Your Orchestra
Your orchestral patches come with several velocity levels and different artic­
ulations to help you create realistic sounding performances. The patches also 
load with smart controls designed to make your performances expressive 
and dynamic.
Select a track and open the smart controls (B), as shown in Figure 12-6. Note 
the Legato and Staccato buttons in the clarinet smart controls; these switch 
between two articulation samples. You can quickly assign these buttons to 
your MIDI controller; for details, see Chapter 3.
	
Figure 12-6: 
The wood-
wind smart 
controls.
	
Sampler instruments are often a surprise to play. You never know how many 
different samples or velocity levels you can experiment with. Designers of 
great sample instruments give you instruments that are instantly playable, 
and the Logic Pro X patches deliver on that promise with their intuitive 
design. But if you want to know exactly what your instrument can do, there’s 
no better place than the EXS24 sample instrument editor. A good patch on 
which to perform a sample autopsy is the Orchestral Kit:
	
1.	Select the track that has the Orchestral Kit patch loaded.
	
	 You should already have a track with the Orchestral Kit patch loaded 
if you followed the instructions in the “Choosing Your Orchestral 
Instruments” section.
	
2.	Open the EXS24 by clicking the center of the instrument slot in the 
inspector (I).
                           

201
 Chapter 12: Conducting a Virtual Orchestra
	
3.	Click the Edit button in the upper right of the EXS24 interface.
	
	 The Instrument Editor window opens.
	
4.	On the instrument editor menu bar, click the Show Velocity button.
	
	 The velocity area shows above the keyboard and zones/group area.
Note how some of the keys have multiple levels of velocity, as shown in 
Figure 12-7. Depending on how hard you hit your MIDI controller, different 
samples will play. Each sample turns blue as you play it. Watching the veloc­
ity of a multisampled EXS24 instrument as you play is a great way to get to 
know the feel of your MIDI controller. Working with the instrument’s preset 
velocity will help you to play a sampled instrument more expressively.

Traveling the World Instruments
As a composer, the ability to use instruments from other cultures provides 
the opportunity to create authentic scores and satisfy artistic and client 
needs. In addition to the full orchestra you already have, you can create a 
project alternative that includes groups of world instrument patches. To 
create a new project alternative, do the following:
	
1.	Choose File➪Alternatives➪New Alternative.
	
	 The new alternative dialog opens.
                           

202
Part III: Making Music with Virtual Instruments 
	
2.	Enter your new alternative name and click OK.
	
	 A new project alternative is created, duplicating the current project 
settings.
Here are several groups of patches you could add to the full orchestra:
	
✓	India: Indian Bansuri Flute, Indian Shehnai Oboe, Indian Sitar, Indian & 
Middle Eastern Kit
	
✓	Africa: African Kalimba, African Kit, South African Singers, South African 
Voice Effects
	
✓	Medieval: European Folk Kit, Celtic Hammered Dulcimer, Celtic Harp, 
Medieval Lute, Celtic Tin Whistle, Medieval Recorder, Irish Bouzouki
	
✓	Asia: Asian Kit, Indonesian Gamelan, Tibetan Singing Bowls, Chinese 
Erhu Violin, Chinese Guzheng Zither, Chinese Ruan Moon Guitar, 
Japanese Koto, Chinese Dizi Flute, Chinese Xiao Flute, Japanese 
Shakuhachi Flute
	
You need to download the World instruments from the Additional Content 
window, as you learned previously in the “Choosing your orchestral instru­
ments” section.
With these patches and your new orchestral template, you can follow in 
the footsteps of John Williams and pull the heartstrings of movie watchers. 
You can learn from the masters and input scores of composing giants Bach, 
Mozart, and Beethoven. You can add a string orchestra to your next rock 
song or record an Indian raga. There’s so much you can do, and now that you 
have your orchestra saved as a template and a patch, you can add it to any 
project that needs a virtual orchestra.

hen you arrange music, you’re organizing instruments and parts until 
they sound and feel good and capture your listener’s attention. Logic 
Pro gives you a structured and flexible environment to make your arranging 
skills develop and blossom. You get instant feedback on your changes and 
tools to make improvements quickly. With Logic Pro as your arranging part­
ner, you’ll find that it does most of the work, leaving you to enjoy the results.
In this chapter, you discover how to make your grooves feel better and 
tighter. You learn how to systematically build an arrangement that will 
keep your listeners interested. And you find efficient ways to enhance your 
arrangement and create parts that stick.
Working in the Tracks Area
After all your tracks are recorded, it’s time to arrange them. You’ll do most of 
your arranging work with regions in the tracks area, deciding which regions 
to play, and when and where to play them.
Recording much more material than you need to build a well-organized 
arrangement is a common practice. Expert arrangers will tell you that a big 
part of arranging is deciding what not to play. With Logic Pro’s visual tracks 
area, you should have no challenges organizing your regions into pleasing 
patterns that stimulate and entertain.

You must select Show Advanced Tools in the Advanced Preferences pane to get 
the most out of Logic Pro X and the information in this chapter. Choose Logic 
Pro X➪Preferences➪Advanced Tools and then select Show Advanced Tools.
Using the ruler
The ruler is the place your eyes look when you need to know where you are 
in the project. The ruler shows you the position of the playhead and regions 
in the tracks area, and it quickly lets you know how much of the project 
you’re seeing in the main window. You use the ruler also to guide you as you 
move regions in your arrangement.
In Chapter 2, you find out how to set the ruler to display bars and beats or 
clock time from the General pane of Project Settings (Option-P). But you can 
have the best of both worlds and view bars and beats as well as clock time 
by displaying the secondary ruler. To show the secondary ruler, choose 
View➪Secondary Ruler (Control-Option-⌘-R) on the tracks area menu bar. 
A second ruler will appear showing either bars and beats or clock time, 
depending on your current selection in the project preferences.
A third ruler that’s useful to have available is the marquee ruler. Choose 
View➪Marquee Ruler on the tracks area menu bar. A small band of empty 
space, called the marquee strip, will appear below the main ruler. The mar­
quee ruler shows the location of the currently selected regions. You can drag 
the marquee selection forward or backward in your project or adjust the 
edges of your selection.
By default, the marquee tool is set as your ⌘-click tool. This means you can 
quickly make selections using the marquee tool by ⌘-dragging across the 
regions you want to select. The marquee tool is also great for setting the play­
back position because playback always begins from the left side of your mar­
quee selection. If your cursor is at the bottom of the main window, it can be 
faster to make a quick marquee selection to set the playback position instead 
of moving your cursor to the top of the tracks area and clicking in the ruler to 
set the playback position.
	
An advanced and precise way to navigate your project is to use the Go 
to Position dialog, shown in Figure 13-1. Press / or choose Navigate➪Go 
To➪Position. When the dialog opens, type the bar number and click OK 
or press Return. This method is my preferred way of navigating Logic Pro 
because the key commands are so much faster than using a trackpad or 
mouse.

Scrubbing the arrangement
	
	 You can drag your cursor along the ruler to audition your project, a process 
known as scrubbing. Scrubbing is useful when you need to find a precise spot 
for an edit. In the transport, click the pause icon (shown in the margin). If the 
pause icon isn’t visible, customize the control bar as described in Chapter 3, 
and select Pause on the transport menu. Drag your cursor along the bottom 
part of the ruler, forward or backward, and the playhead will scrub the audio 
and MIDI at the speed of your cursor.
Sometimes, you might not want your MIDI regions to scrub with your audio. 
To scrub only audio in the tracks area, choose File➪Project Settings➪MIDI, 
click the General tab, and deselect the Scrubbing with Audio in Tracks Area 
check box. If an audio region is selected in the tracks area, only the selected 
audio will be scrubbed.
Although not enabled by default, you can set up key commands to Scrub 
Rewind and Scrub Forward in your project. You find out how to create key 
commands in Chapter 3.
Investigating the region inspector
The inspector has a lot of arranging power. And because a lot of arranging is 
done with regions, the region inspector area is a great arranging tool. Display 
the inspector (I) and click the disclosure triangle to display the region inspector 
area, which is shown in Figure 13-2. When you select a region or multiple regions 
in the tracks area, the region inspector is updated based on the selection. If 
you want to select all the regions and edit them simultaneously using the 
region inspector, click the track header, and all the regions on the track will be 
selected. Then you can edit them as a group from the inspector.

Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
	
Figure 13-2: 
The region 
inspector.
	
The parameters available in the region inspector depend on the type of 
selected track. All region inspectors have an additional disclosure triangle 
to hide and show more parameters. The benefit of editing the regions in the 
inspector is that the edits are nondestructive. You can always go back to the 
region’s original state by undoing the inspector changes.
Here’s a description of some of the available parameters:
	
✓	Mute: Mute the selected regions.
	
✓	Loop: Loop the selected regions indefinitely or until they reach the next 
region on the track.
	
✓	Quantize: Correct the timing of notes. Choose the quantize value on the 
pop-up menu and all your notes will snap to the nearest division.
	
✓	Q-Swing: Determine the amount of shuffle feel to add to your quantize 
value. A setting between 50% and 75% will give you a natural swing feel.
	
✓	Transpose: Change the value in the Transpose field to transpose MIDI 
regions and Apple loops.
	
✓	Gain: Raise or lower the volume of audio regions and Apple loops. The 
main downside of using the Gain field to lower the volume of regions is 
that the audio waveform gets smaller in the tracks area and audio editors. 
It’s better to use this Gain parameter to raise the level of tracks that are 
recorded too low.
                           

209
 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
	
✓	Delay: Adjust the timing of your regions. A great use for the Delay field is 
with orchestral choir patches. Because choir patches have a slow attack 
time, delaying the region by a negative value pulls the region forward in the 
project. You can get a natural timing of the choir with the rest of the tracks 
by adjusting the delay to compensate for the slow attack. If you want a 
region to have a laid-back feel, the Delay setting is perfect for this kind of 
experimentation.
	
✓	Fade In/Out: Fade in and out audio regions. By using the region inspec­
tor, you can quickly fade multiple tracks, such as drums, simultaneously. 
You often need to fade into the beginning of audio regions to minimize 
room noise that’s present before the part begins. For example, you may 
need to remove room noise from live drums. With the region inspector, 
you can select an entire group of drum tracks and fade them in and out.
Investigating the track inspector
Below the region inspector is the track inspector, as shown in Figure 13-3. You 
use the track inspector to edit the currently selected track. To edit multiple 
tracks simultaneously, first select them by Shift-clicking the track headers.
	
Figure 13-3: 
The track 
inspector.
	
	
You can select a region without selecting the track that the region is on, so 
make sure that you select the track and not just a region on the track.
Similar to the region inspector, the track inspector shows you different 
parameters depending on the type of track selected. Here’s a description of 
some of the parameters available:
	
✓	Icon: Control-click the track icon to choose an icon on the pop-up menu, 
as shown in Figure 13-4.
	
✓	Channel: Display the channel strip type and number. The channel 
parameter is for reference only and isn’t editable.
                           

210
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Figure 13-4: 
The track 
icon menu.
	
✓	Freeze mode: Freeze a track to reduce processing power on the track 
by temporarily turning the track and all its audio effects into an audio 
file. (In Chapter 3, you find out how to freeze tracks in the track header.) 
Freeze mode parameter can be set to Source Only, in which the track 
is frozen without effects plug-ins, or to Pre Fader, in which the track is 
frozen with all effects plug-ins.
	
✓	Q-reference: On audio tracks, use the track’s transients (peaks in volume) 
as reference points during the quantization of an edit group. For more on 
editing audio, see Chapter 14.
	
✓	Flex mode: Define how the audio will be processed while flex editing. 
You can discover more about flex editing in Chapter 14.
	
✓	MIDI channel: On MIDI tracks, choose the MIDI channel for the track’s 
output.
Showing Your Global Tracks
In Chapter 4, you find out about global tracks, which affect all your project’s 
tracks. Global tracks are useful when you’re arranging because they help 
you create markers for quick navigation and for important sections of your 
project.
                           

211
 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
To view the global tracks, choose Track➪Global Tracks➪Show Global 
Tracks (G). The global tracks appear at the top of the tracks area, as shown 
in Figure 13-5. If you don’t see a global track you’re looking for, choose 
Track➪Global Tracks➪Configure Global Tracks (Option-G) and select the 
global tracks you want to view.
	
Figure 13-5: 
The global

Creating and naming markers
Markers are excellent arrangement tools. They allow you to quickly navigate 
your project and select regions. You can also rename markers to help you iden­
tify sections in your project. You can view and edit markers in several ways:
	
✓	Choose Track➪Global Tracks➪Show Marker Track or press Shift-⌘-K to 
display the marker track.
	
✓	Choose View➪Show List Editors (D) and then click the Marker tab to 
view the marker list editor, as shown in Figure 13-6.
	
✓	Choose Navigate➪Open Marker List to view the marker list in a new 
window.
                           

212
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
	
Figure 13-6: 
The marker 
list editor.
	
To create and edit markers, do one of the following:
	
✓	Click the plus sign icon in any of the marker editors to add a new marker 
at the current playhead position.
	
✓	In the global marker track, use the pencil tool and click the location 
where you want to create a new marker.
	
✓	In the marker list editor or Marker List window, choose Options➪Create.
	
✓	At any time, press Option-apostrophe (‘) to create a new marker at the 
current playhead position.
When you create a new marker, the default behavior is to round the marker 
to the nearest beat. If you want to create a marker without rounding, choose 
Navigate➪Other➪Create without Rounding or choose Options➪Create with­
out Rounding from the marker lists.
Moving, renaming, and deleting markers is a straightforward process:
	
✓	In the global marker track, drag the edges of the marker to change its 
start and end points. Double-click the marker or use the text tool to 
rename it. You can delete selected markers by pressing Delete. Control-
click the marker to access a pop-up menu with more marker commands.
	
✓	In the marker list editors, you can cut, copy, paste, and delete markers 
on the Edit menu. You can adjust the position and length of markers by 
typing in the marker list. Double-clicking a marker will open the Edit 
                           

213
 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
Marker Text area at the bottom of the editor window. Use this area to 
rename markers and add text notes to your marker. This spot is great for 
lyrics or notes about the arrangement.
You can also store alternate marker sets. If you need to create markers at a 
few places in your project to make edits later, but you don’t want to mess 
up your current arrangement of markers, you can create a new marker set 
and even give it a descriptive name. From the marker list editor, choose New 
Set on the Marker Set drop-down menu. To create a new marker set from the 
global tracks, click the Marker title in the track header and choose Marker 
Sets➪New Set on the pop-up menu. You can also rename sets from these 
menus.
	
If you have an extended keyboard with an extra number pad, press the number 
keys to instantly move the playhead to the corresponding marker number. You 
can also navigate markers by using the Next Marker and Previous Marker key 
commands: ⌘-period (.) and ⌘-comma (,). Whenever you find yourself wishing 
you could go to the same places in your project over and over again, create a 
new marker set and create a few markers. Then you can zip to the stored loca­
tions quickly.
Here are a some more uses and tips for markers:
	
✓	Use the Go to Marker Number key command (Option-/) to open a dialog 
where you can type the marker number and press Enter to instantly take 
the playhead to the marker.
	
✓	Markers make it fast and easy to set locators. Use the Set Locators by 
Marker and Enable Cycle key command (Control-Option-C). You can 
explore other key commands by opening the Key Commands window 
(Option-K) and typing marker in the search field.
	
✓	You can color your markers by choosing View➪View Colors (Option-C). 
Click a color in the palette and the selected marker will be colored.
	
✓	The marker track can be resized to view all the text in your markers. 
Put your cursor over the bottom edge of the marker track in the track 
header and pull down when your cursor becomes the resize tool.
Creating key signature and 
time signature changes
The signature global track does double duty, handling the key signature and 
the time signature. Choose Track➪Global Tracks➪Show Signature Track. The 
top half of the track shows the time signature, and the bottom half shows 
                           

214
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
the key signature. You can also view and edit the signature track from the 
signature list editor. Choose View➪Show List Editors (D) and then click the 
Signature tab to view the signature list editor, shown in Figure 13-7.
	
Figure 13-7: 
The 
signature 
list editor.
	
You use the pencil tool to create signature changes in global tracks. Click the 
top half of the signature track to create a time signature change. The Time 
Signature window opens, as shown in Figure 13-8, and you can choose the 
number of beats per bar and the note value that equals one beat. You can 
also define how you want the beat divided. For example, a 7/4 time signature 
that’s divided as 2+2+3 can be entered as 223 in the Beat Grouping field. The 
beat grouping feature affects the display of notation in the score editor.
	
Figure 13-8: 
The Time 
Signature 
window.
	
You create key signature changes by clicking the bottom half of the signature 
track. The Key Signature window opens, as shown in Figure 13-9. Choose 
the Key, Major or Minor, and whether to disable double flats (bb) or double 
sharps (x) in the score editor.
                           

215
 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
	
Figure 13-9: 
The Key 
Signature 
window.
	
To edit signature changes, double-click the signature change in the signature 
track. You can edit your signature changes also in the signature list editor. 
Just like with the marker track, you can create signature sets. Click the 
Signature name in the track header and choose Signature Sets➪New Set on 
the drop-down menu. Or use the signature list editor to create, delete, and 
rename signature sets on the Signature Set drop-down menu.
	
Key signature changes don’t change the pitch of the audio or MIDI regions 
you’ve recorded. They change only the display of the regions in the score editor.
Creating tempo changes
Most projects have a single tempo. But when projects need tempo changes, 
it’s nice to know that Logic Pro makes the job simple and effective. Choose 
Track➪Global Tracks➪Show Tempo Track (Shift-⌘-T). The tempo track 
behaves similarly to the other global tracks. But unlike the other tracks, the 
tempo track can handle more edit points and create smooth curves for natu­
ral feeling tempo changes.
Use the pencil tool to create a tempo change in the tempo track. A solid 
tempo control point will appear on the tempo line along with a hollow tempo 
curve automation point that you can drag left and right or up and down to 
create tempo curves between two points, as shown in Figure 13-10.
	
Figure 13-10: 
The tempo 
track.
	
Change the tempo resolution, change the quantization, and create tempo sets 
by clicking the Tempo name in the tempo track header and making a choice 
on the pop-up menu. Another way to adjust your tempo is with the tempo list 
editor, as shown in Figure 13-11. Press D to open the list editor and then click 
the Tempo tab.
                           

216
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
	
Figure 13-11: 
The tempo 
list editor.
	
In the tempo list editor, click the Additional Info button to see all tempo 
points used to create your tempo curves. Because a curve can contain hun­
dreds of tempo changes, it’s useful to hide that information when you’re 
viewing your tempo changes. Choose Options➪Tempo Operations to open 
the Tempo Operations window, as shown in Figure 13-12.
	
Figure 13-12: 
The Tempo 
Operations 
window.
	
                           

217
 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
The Tempo Operations window is capable of creating complex tempo curves 
or scaling existing tempo changes. Explore the Operation menu to see the 
other tempo operations available. Because the Tempo Operations window has 
an Undo button, it’s a great place to try out your tempo changes until you get 
it just right.
	
If you’ve imported audio into your project and you’re unsure of the tempo, 
you can use beat detection to create tempo changes. Select a region in the 
tracks area and choose Edit➪Tempo➪Adjust Tempo using Beat Detection 
(Option-⌘-T). The Beat Detection window opens, as shown in Figure 13-13. 
The Beat Detection window displays the tempo of the region and enables you 
to create tempo changes.
	
Figure 13-13: 
The Beat 
Detection 
window.
	
Creating arrangement markers
Arrangement markers are new to Logic Pro X. They are similar to regular mark­
ers but can be used to rearrange your project globally. To view the arrangement 
track, choose Track➪Global Tracks➪Show Arrangement Track (Shift-⌘-A). 
You create arrangement markers with the pencil tool. By default, arrangement 
markers are eight bars long, but you can drag the edges of the markers to resize 
them. Click the name of the marker to choose a different preset name on the 
pop-up menu, or choose Rename to create your own marker name.
You can select arrangement markers and drag them to new positions on the 
arrangement track. All regions within the arrangement markers will be moved 
to the new position. You can select multiple arrangement markers by Shift-
clicking them, and you can copy arrangement markers, including the regions 
                           

218
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
within them, by Option-dragging the marker to a new location. All arrange­
ment markers and their content will be shifted to the right to make room for 
the new arrangement. You can replace markers by ⌘-dragging an arrange­
ment marker on top of another one.
	
Deleting markers removes all the regions within the marker. There’s no way to 
delete an arrangement marker without deleting the regions within it.
Creating transposition points
The transposition track transposes the key of your Apple loops and MIDI regions 
globally. Audio regions, drum loops, and Apple loops with undefined keys are 
unaffected by the transposition track. If you don’t want a software instrument or 
MIDI track to be transposed, select No Transpose in the track inspector.
To open the transposition track, choose Track➪Global Tracks➪Show Trans­
po­sition Track (Shift-⌘-X). You create transposition control points with the 
pencil tool. Drag the control points up or down with the pointer tool to adjust 
the level of transposition. Delete selected control points by pressing Delete.
	
Decide quickly if you’re going to transpose individual regions or transpose 
the track globally. If you change the transposition of a single region and then 
decide to transpose the entire project from the transposition track, you may 
end up transposing that region more than you intend.
	
If you want the ultimate control, it’s best to transpose individual regions from 
the region inspector, but that process can be time consuming. If you’re just 
trying something out and want to temporarily transpose your project, the 
transposition track is the right tool for the job. It works great for trying out 
harmonic modulations in songs or when you’re finding the right key for a 
singer at the beginning of your project.
Beat Mapping Your Arrangement
If you didn’t record to a metronome or you’re importing audio that was 
recorded in a different session or in other software, you’ll need to align your 
ruler to the imported tracks. For that task, you should use the beat map­
ping track. Beat mapping makes the project tempo follow the audio or MIDI 
regions in your project. After you beat map your project, you can do things 
such as overdub with the metronome, quantize regions, loop regions, and 
view MIDI in the score editor.
To show the beat mapping track, shown in Figure 13-14, choose Tracks➪Global 
Tracks➪Show Beat Mapping Track (Shift-⌘-B).

Beat mapping MIDI regions
Not every project requires a metronome. Sometimes, you want to play freely, 
known as tempo rubato. But when the recording is completed, you can use 
beat mapping to adjust the ruler to fit the performance. Beat mapping makes 
editing easier and makes it possible to view your MIDI recordings in the score 
editor. Here’s how you beat map MIDI regions:
	
1.	Select the MIDI regions.
	
	 The beat mapping track displays the contents of the selected regions.
	
2.	Click the position in the beat mapping ruler that you want to map to a 
note.
	
	 A vertical line appears in the beat mapping track.
	
3.	Drag the vertical line to the note.
	
	 The tempo adjusts, and the ruler position and note are aligned.
	
4.	Repeat Steps 2 and 3 with other ruler positions and notes.
	
You might want to beat map the ruler to a place in a region that doesn’t have a 
note. To do this, Control-drag the vertical line to the place on the region you 
want to map.
Beat mapping audio regions
The process for beat mapping audio regions is similar to the one for MIDI 
regions except you have to analyze the audio beforehand. To analyze the 
audio for beat detection, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the audio regions to be analyzed.
	
2.	Click the Beat Mapping title in the global tracks header, and then 
choose Analyze Transients on the pop-up menu.
	
	 The audio is analyzed for peaks in volume, known as transients. Transients 
appear as blue lines in the beat mapping track.
                           

220
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
	
3.	Click the position in the beat mapping ruler that you want to map to a 
transient.
	
4.	Drag the vertical line to the transient.
	
	 The tempo adjusts to the audio region.
Automatically beat-mapping regions
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, Logic Pro does a lot of arrang­
ing work for you. It’s good to know how to beat map audio and MIDI regions, 
but you can also let Logic Pro automatically beat map your regions. Simply 
do the following:
	
1.	Select the regions to beat map.
	
2.	Click the Beat Mapping title in the global tracks header, and then 
choose Beats from Region on the pop-up menu.
	
	 The Set Beats by Guide Region(s) window opens, as shown in Figure 13-15.
	
Figure 13-15: 
Set Beats 
by Guide 
Regions 
window.
	
	
3.	Choose the Note Value.
	
	 The note value sets the beat map resolution.
	
4.	If an audio region is selected, select the algorithm.
	
	 Select the Tolerating Missing or Additional Events check box to map 
only the most important transients. Select the Use Exactly All Events 
check box to map every transient.
	
5.	Click OK.
	
	 Transients appear as blue lines in the beat mapping track, and the 
tempo is adjusted to the region.

 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
Arranging Regions in the Tracks Area
Arranging in Logic Pro consists mostly of organizing your regions so they 
make sense to your ear. You can also apply arranging techniques to a single 
region in terms of harmony, such as string or horn arranging. But the tracks 
area is the broad stroke palette for you to use to paint your sonic master­
piece. Here are some tips to help you begin arranging:
	
✓	Create contrast: Creating contrast in your arrangement adds energy, for­
ward motion, and interest. If you want your arrangement to sound big, 
make it small first. Create contrast through the use of different combina­
tions of instruments in your song sections. Moving from dense to sparse, 
intense to relaxed, and unstable to stable will keep your listener’s atten­
tion. Look for ways to provide refreshing contrast in your song form, 
rhythm, harmony, and melody.
	
✓	Arrange your song form: Your song form can be arranged and rearranged. 
At the least, your song will probably have two different sections. Use your 
song form as an arrangement tool. For example, change the order of your 
sections using the arrangement markers to see if they sound better.
	
✓	Add and release tension: You can simplify the job of all harmony to 
tension and release. Every time you play the root chord, you release 
the tension. (In the key of C, for example, the root chord is C.) Every 
time you move away from the root chord, you build tension. Pay close 
attention to where you place the root chord in your song and find ways 
to build tension and release it. In terms of contrast, you can adjust the 
length of your chord progression, add or subtract chords from sections, 
and start each section on different chords.
	
✓	Provide consistency and contrast: The big driver of pop music is rhythm. 
(I use the term pop music loosely, as in the opposite of unpopular music.) 
Listeners want consistency and variation, in other words, contrast. Give 
the listener consistency by keeping the rhythms similar in the A sections, 
and give the listener contrast by doing something different in your B sec­
tions. In songwriting, for example, keep the rhythms of your verses consis­
tent but contrast the chorus rhythm from your verse. Note that the term 
rhythm includes the rhythm of your harmony and melody in addition to 
the rhythm of the drums and other rhythmic instruments.
	
✓	Rearrange sounds: Your instrument choices can complement and 
contrast each other. You learn how to create an orchestral template in 
Chapter 12, and the different orchestral sections are a great example of 
compliment and contrast. Brass is metallic and bright, woodwinds are 
nasal and soft, strings are warm and lush, and percussion is sharp and 
punchy. All those sounds can be rearranged in many wonderful combi­
nations to create interest for your listener.

Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Selecting regions
The bulk of arranging work is done on regions, so you’ll do a lot of selecting 
in the tracks area with the pointer tool. You open the tool menu by pressing 
T. Note that each tool has a key command associated with it, as shown in 
Figure 13-16. After you open the tool menu by pressing T, you can press the 
key command for the tool you want. Pressing T twice selects the pointer tool. 
These shortcuts make selecting regions quick and easy.
	
Figure 13-16: 
The tool 
menu.
	
	
You can select more than one region by Shift-clicking regions one by one or by 
dragging your cursor around the regions you want to select. You can select all 
the regions on a track by clicking the track header.
You can select regions in more ways by using the Edit menu. To select all the 
regions in your project, choose Edit➪Select All. If you Control-click an empty 
spot in the tracks area, you have more selection choices, such as Select 
Overlapped Regions/Events, which is useful if you need to select regions that 
are underneath other regions. If you Control-click a region, another menu 
of selection commands appears in a pop-up window, such as Select➪Invert 
Selection. You can also navigate and select regions by using the arrow keys.
Selecting parts of regions 
with the marquee tool
Sometimes, you’ll want to select only parts of regions. For example, a live 
drum performance could contain a dozen tracks, each with a single region 
the length of the entire song. When you want to select only a portion of those 
regions, you use the marquee tool.
                           

223
 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
To select a portion of a region or group of regions, select the marquee tool on 
the tool menu (T) and drag your cursor around the area you want to select. 
The selection is outlined and brighter in color, as shown in Figure 13-17. In 
addition to selecting regions, your marquee selection is used for playback. 
As long as the selection is in place, playback begins at the left of the selected 
regions.
	
Figure 13-17: 
A marquee 
tool 
selection.
	
You can remove a region from the selection by Shift-clicking the region. You 
can adjust the edges of a selection by Shift-clicking an edge and dragging. If 
the marquee ruler is displayed, you can move the selection left or right by 
dragging in the ruler. To display the marquee ruler, choose View➪Marquee 
Ruler on the tracks area menu bar.
Marquee selections have many uses. You can apply edits to your selection, 
and you can also navigate by using your selection. For example, pressing 
Z will zoom to fit your selection. You can set your locators by the marquee 
selection (for use in cycle mode) by pressing ⌘-U.
Logic Pro doesn’t take selecting objects for granted. If you take the time to 
practice some alternate methods of selecting regions, besides simply clicking 
regions individually with the pencil tool, you’ll be rewarded with a fast and 
productive workflow, which means less time clicking and more time creating.
	
Here’s a good reason to colorize your tracks. If you color groups of tracks the 
same color, you can choose File➪Select➪Equal Colored Regions (Shift-C) and 
select them all in an instant.
                           

224
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Moving regions
After you select regions, you can drag them anywhere in the tracks area. 
Keep in mind that you can drag a region to a different track type, but the 
region will play only if it’s moved to the same track type.
You copy regions by Option-dragging them to a new location. Change the 
length of a region by dragging its bottom corner to the new length. You loop 
a region by dragging its top corner to the right as far as you want it to loop.
A great key command to memorize is the nudge command. Press Option-
right arrow to nudge the selected region to the right by the nudge value. 
Press Option-left arrow to nudge the region to the left. Set the nudge value 
by Control-clicking a region and choosing Move➪Set Nudge Value To on 
the pop-up menu. You can set the nudge value to a variety of lengths, such 
as bars and beats, milliseconds and samples, or video frames. Press the 
semicolon key (;) to move the selected region to the playhead position.
Copying and pasting works the same as in many other Mac applications. You 
make a selection and copy it by pressing ⌘-C or choosing Edit➪Copy. You 
paste your selection on the selected track at the playhead position by press­
ing ⌘-V or choosing Edit➪Paste.
	
Don’t forget to deselect your regions when you’re finished making changes. 
Deselecting your regions is a safety measure against accidentally editing 
or deleting regions and not realizing it. The key command to deselect all is 
Shift-Option-D. You can also deselect regions by clicking an empty spot in the 
tracks area or choosing Edit➪Select➪Deselect All.
Soloing and muting regions
Soloing regions is less of an arrangement tool and more of a mixing or edit­
ing tool. You solo regions or tracks to listen to the details of the recording. 
Sometimes, editing or mixing in solo mode is useful for silencing all distrac­
tions and hearing minute details. To play regions in solo mode, select the 
solo tool on the tool menu (T) and click-hold the region to play it without any 
other tracks.
The mute tool is much more useful in an arranging workflow. You want the 
capability to silence regions without committing to deleting them. Expert 
arrangers know that it’s as important to leave things out as it is to put things in. 
It’s common to record more than you need and then mute what you don’t need. 
Muting is a huge part of arranging.
                           

225
 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
Select the mute tool on the tool menu (T) and click the regions you want to 
mute. Muted regions appear dark gray in the tracks area. To unmute a region, 
click the region again using the mute tool.
You can also mute regions in the region inspector. Press I to open the inspec­
tor and then click the disclosure triangle to open the region inspector, as 
shown in Figure 13-18. Select the Mute check box to silence the region. Notice 
how the mute tool updates the mute check box in the region inspector and 
vice versa.
	
Figure 13-18: 
The region 
inspector.
	
	
Two useful key commands to remember are Control-M to mute regions and 
Shift-M to select muted regions. For example, if you have a few regions muted 
but not selected, press Shift-M to select the muted regions and then press 
Control-M to unmute the regions.
Time-stretching regions
If you import a MIDI or audio file that doesn’t fit your project tempo perfectly, 
you can stretch or shrink the region so it fits the tempo. To time stretch 
a region, Option-drag the lower-right or lower-left edge of the region. The 
region will be compressed or expanded. If you’re time stretching an audio 
region, you can choose Edit➪Time Stretch➪Time Stretching Algorithm and 
select one of the following options:
	
✓	Universal: The default algorithm and a good option for most time 
stretching
	
✓	Complex: A good option for full mixes and complex sounds
	
✓	Percussive: A good option for drums and percussive sounds
                           

226
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Demixing MIDI regions
Standard MIDI files contain more information than just note values. These 
files contain tempo changes, marker names and positions, and individual 
track names, as well as the MIDI events such as notes, time positions, and 
MIDI channels. The two MIDI file formats are 0 and 1. Format 0 contains all 
the data in a single track, and format 1 contains multiple tracks. Depending 
on the type of MIDI file you import, you could be importing multiple MIDI 
channels on a single track. In situations like this, you can demix the MIDI 
events in a region by MIDI channel:
	
1.	Select the MIDI region.
	
2.	Choose Edit➪Separate MIDI Events➪By Event Channel.
	
	 A new track is added to the tracks area, and a MIDI region is created for 
each channel containing data.
A similar situation is called for when you have a MIDI region containing a 
drum pattern and you want each drum on its own track for individual control. 
Choose Edit➪Separate MIDI Events➪By Note Pitch. Each note that contains 
data will be added to a new track and region. You can also separate MIDI 
events by Control-clicking the region and choosing MIDI➪Separate by Note 
Pitch or Separate by MIDI Channel on the pop-up menu.
Fading and crossfading audio regions
When you organize audio regions in the tracks area, sometimes you need to 
smoothly crossfade between two regions. A crossfade makes the transition 
between two audio files sound more natural. And sometimes you need to fade 
in and out of audio regions to get rid of noise. Guitar players who love distor­
tion know what I mean.
Select the fade tool on the tool menu (T), and drag over the beginning of an 
audio region to fade in or drag over the end to fade out. A fade is created on 
the region, as shown in Figure 13-19. To crossfade between two regions, drag 
over the end of one region and the beginning of another. With the fade tool 
selected, you can adjust the fade length by dragging it in the region.

 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
Stripping silence from audio regions
Sometimes you’ll record a take the entire length of a song but record audio 
only some of the time, for example, when recording background vocal tracks. 
You might be recording only a few notes every fourth bar, but you leave 
record on for the entire length of the song. You can quickly strip the silence 
from the long region to create many smaller regions. Control-click the region 
and choose Split➪Strip Silence (Control-X) on the pop-up menu. The Strip 
Silence window opens, as shown in Figure 13-20, and you can adjust the set­
tings that determine the number of regions. Click OK and your big region 
becomes many regions.

Creating Folder Tracks
Logic Pro can help you organize your arrangement and experiment with dif­
ferent arrangements by using folders. A folder is a container. It looks just like 
a region but it can contain other regions. You can also have folders within 
folders. You might use folders to
	
✓	Organize tracks and song sections
	
✓	Nest parts of an arrangement
	
✓	Nest alternate versions of a part
                           

228
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
	
If you want to organize your tracks, another option is a folder track stack. You 
find out how to create track stacks in Chapter 4. Track stacks make it easy to 
open and close folders of tracks, which simplifies your workspace.
Packing and unpacking folders
You can select as many regions as you want and put them into a folder. If the 
selected regions are on the same track, the folder is added to the same track 
as the regions. But if the selected regions are on different tracks, a new folder 
track is created. To create a folder, do the following:
	
1.	Select the regions you want to include in the folder.
	
2.	On the tracks area menu bar, choose Functions➪Folder➪Pack Folder.
	
	 A folder track is created containing the regions, as shown in Figure 13-21, 
and the regions are removed from the tracks area.
Figure 13-21: 
A folder 
track.
	
	 A folder looks like a region in the tracks area. A folder doesn’t have a channel 
strip, so a folder track does not have audio controls. Double-click the folder 
to open the folder contents and display the tracks area of the folder. To leave 
the folder, click the leave folder icon (shown in the margin) on the tracks area 
menu bar or double-click an empty spot in the tracks area.
	
You can drag a folder region to an audio or MIDI track type and the corre­
sponding contents of the region will play through the track’s channel strip. So 
if you drag a folder that contains MIDI to a MIDI track type, the MIDI regions 
play through the track’s channel strip. Likewise, a folder containing audio 
regions can be played on an audio track.
To unpack the contents of a folder, do the following:
	
1.	Select the folder region.
	
2.	Choose Functions➪Folder➪Unpack Folder to Existing Tracks or 
Unpack Folder to New Tracks.
	
	 The regions contained in the folder are added to the tracks area.
                           

229
 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
Adding and removing regions
To add regions to an existing folder, drag them onto the folder at the loca­
tion you want them to play. The region is moved into the folder along with its 
track. To remove regions from the folder track, open a second main window 
and drag the regions from the folder to the main tracks area:
	
1.	Press ⌘-1 or choose Window➪Open Main Window.
	
	 A second main window opens in a new window.
	
2.	Double-click the folder region to view its contents.
	
	 The tracks area displays all the regions contained in the folder.
	
3.	Drag the regions from the folder to the tracks area in the first main 
window where you want them to play.
	
	 Your region is moved to the main tracks area and is no longer contained 
in the folder.
Creating alias folders and regions
Region aliases and clones are references not to science-fiction movies but 
to regions in the tracks area. You can create a region that references an 
original region, allowing you to edit the original and have the alias change 
too. These regions are referred to as aliases if they’re MIDI regions or clones 
if they’re audio regions. You can also create folder aliases. Aliases are great 
for parts that repeat because you have to edit only the original region, and all 
the aliases will be updated with the new edit.
To create an alias of a region, press Shift-Option while dragging the region to 
a new location. If you make an alias of a MIDI region or folder region, the alias 
region looks different than the original, as shown in Figure 13-22. The name is 
in italics and the region has an alias icon. Cloned audio regions look the same 
as the original, which makes them less desirable than MIDI or folder regions.
	
Figure 13-22: 
A region 
alias.
	
                           

230
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
	
Audio clones have limited cloning capability because only the start and end 
points of the original region are cloned. You can get around this limitation by 
packing the audio regions into a folder and then making an alias of the folder. 
Then all the edits you make to the regions in the original folder will be cloned 
in the folder alias.
Using Groove Templates
Another important part of arranging is creating parts that feel good together. 
Logic Pro gives you two amazing ways to make audio, and MIDI tracks follow 
the same groove: 
	
✓	Groove track: You can set one track in your project as the groove 
track and select other tracks to follow the timing of the groove track. 
Control-click anywhere on the track list and choose Track Header 
Components➪Show Groove Track. Click the track number of the track 
that defines the groove. A second column of check boxes appears in the 
track header, as shown in Figure 13-23. Select the check box to follow the 
groove track.
	
✓	Groove template: You can create custom quantized grids based on an 
audio or MIDI region. You apply the grid to other regions so they get the 
same feel.
	
Figure 13-23: 
The groove 
track.
	
	
You can make groove templates as long as you like, but it’s usually best to 
create short ones, between two and four bars. Because you can create mul­
tiple groove templates in a project, you can model the groove from several 
different instruments and musical parts and use it throughout your project to 
enhance the timing and feel.
                           

231
 Chapter 13: Arranging Your Music
Creating a groove template
If you have a drummer track in your project, selecting a drummer region for 
your groove template is a great choice. But if you have a region that you think 
defines the groove better, select it. Better yet, create groove templates from 
both regions. Nothing is holding you back from creating groove templates 
from every region in your project. To create a groove template:
	
1.	Select the region you want to model for the groove template.
	
2.	On the Flex Mode pop-up menu in the track inspector (I), select a flex 
time mode, as shown in Figure 13-24.
	
	 Because the transients in the audio region are used to quantize the 
region, either Slicing or Rhythmic flex time mode is a good choice.
	
3.	On the Quantize pop-up menu in the region inspector, select Make 
Groove Template.
	
	 The groove template is added to the quantize menu, named after the 
region.
	
4.	Select the regions you want to quantize with the groove template.
	
5.	On the Quantize pop-up menu in the region inspector, select the new 
groove template.
	
	 The timing of the region matches the groove template.
	
Figure 13-24: 
The track 
and region 
inspector.
	
                           

232
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
	
If you delete the region on which a groove template is based, the groove tem­
plate is deleted too. After a groove template quantizes a region, you can create 
a second groove template from the quantized region. This safeguards your 
groove template from being lost if the original region is deleted. You can also 
manually remove groove templates by using the region inspector Quantize 
menu.
Importing groove templates 
from other projects
Because groove templates are based on regions in your project, any media 
you import can be used as a groove template. You can collect regions with 
good grooves and save them in a project template, as you learn in Chapter 2. 
Start your next project with this template and all your grooves will be ready 
to load.
	
Groove track and groove templates can be used together. You can create 
groove templates from the tracks that follow your groove tracks. You can now 
delete the original groove track because the tracks that were following the 
groove track are now following a groove template.
Importing third-party groove templates
You can import third-party groove templates by choosing File➪Import➪Other 
and navigating to the file. Logic Pro supports standard MIDI files and DNA 
Groove Template files. Because groove templates are basically MIDI events 
that are used to set quantize values, any imported MIDI file can become a 
groove template. Also, because you can quantize audio using flex time, as 
you learn in Chapter 14, even your imported audio can become a groove 
template. Groove templates are unbeatable at getting the right feel in your 
arrangement.
Now that you can build an arrangement in the tracks area, you can listen to 
how your favorite artists arrange their music and duplicate what they do in 
Logic Pro. You can import audio you love and make templates to tighten up 
your groove. Your command of folders and global tracks will make you more 
productive.
If you put Logic Pro to work for you, your arrangements will feel great and 
sound solid. Even the greatest musicians can benefit from Logic Pro’s timing 
enhancements and workflow shortcuts. Don’t feel odd or embarrassed if 
you find yourself saying, “Logic Pro, I couldn’t have done it without you.” I’m 
almost certain Logic Pro thinks the same about you.

Editing Audio Tracks
In This Chapter

▶	Creating composite takes
▶	Fixing pitch and audio timing
▶	Repairing audio glitches
I

magine you’re back in the time before personal computers and you want 
to edit audio. You would have to use a razor blade on tape — with no 
undo command. The process wouldn’t be creative or quick, and you wouldn’t 
edit analog audio just to experiment.
Fast-forward to the present. Music is in high demand in this high-speed 
world. You don’t have the luxury of taking months to finish a project — your 
Internet fans want it yesterday. Logic Pro X makes editing audio so simple 
and powerful that you can meet the demands of your fans and clients without 
breaking a sweat — or cutting your fingers on a razor blade.
In this chapter, you discover how to create the perfect take with Logic Pro’s 
quick swipe comping. You find out how to get the timing of your parts just 
right and tune up the pitch. And you learn how to get the best sound out of 
your audio and even create sounds that you didn’t record in the first place.
Knowing Your Audio Editors
Logic Pro X provides you with several ways to edit audio. You can do some 
audio editing right from the tracks area, as you learn in Chapter 13. In this 
section, you discover the specialized Logic Pro X audio editors.

Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
The audio track editor
The audio track editor, shown in Figure 14-1, is the default Logic Pro audio 
editor. It works well for most audio editing needs. You can open the audio 
track editor in any of the following ways:
	
✓	Double-click an audio region.
	
✓	Choose View➪Show Editor with an audio region selected.
	
✓	Press E with an audio region selected.
	
Figure 14-1: 
The audio 
track editor.
	
The audio file editor
The audio file editor, shown in Figure 14-2, is used for sample-level audio edit­
ing. It works well at audio repair, such as removing pops and clicks. You can 
open the audio file editor in the following ways:
	
✓	Double-click an audio region, and then click the File tab at the top of the 
audio editor.
	
✓	Choose View➪Show Editor with an audio region selected, and then click 
the File tab at the top of the audio editor.

✓	Choose Window➪Open Audio File Editor to open the editor in a new 
window.
	
✓	Press Option and double-click an audio region in the project audio 
browser.
	
Figure 14-2: 
The audio 
file editor.
	
	
The audio file editor is considered a destructive editor because the original 
audio file on your hard drive is modified. You can still undo your edits, but it’s 
always safer to work with copies of your audio files.
Creating the Perfect Take with 
Quick Swipe Comping
Creating the perfect take used to be time consuming. But since Logic Pro 
automatically records take folders, creating a composite take (a comp take) 
is almost too easy. You can quickly create a comp take by swiping on takes 
in a take folder, as you learn in this section. Quick swipe comping is another 
example of how Logic Pro X does the heavy lifting, allowing you to focus on 
creating.
	
Show Advanced Tools must be selected in the Advanced Preferences pane to 
get access to the additional audio editors. Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪
Advanced Tools and select Show Advanced Tools.

Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Comping takes
A comp take is studio-speak for a composite take, a single recording made from 
many recordings. Comping used to require a lot of copying and pasting — as 
well as razor blades and tape before digital audio came along. As you learn 
in Chapter 6, Logic Pro puts your recorded takes on multiple lanes of a single 
track, as shown in Figure 14-3. Each lane enables you to drag through the 
region to hide or display audio from the take and build a final composite take. 
For example, with a vocal performance, you can take one word or even just 
part of a word from a single take and improve your singer’s performance. (Just 
don’t tell the singer or you might bruise his or her ego.)
	
Figure 14-3: 
A take 
folder.
	
To create a single take from multiple takes, do the following:
	
1.	In the upper-left corner of the take folder, click the disclosure triangle 
to see the individual take lanes.
	
2.	Preview an individual take by clicking it and playing your project.
	
	 If you have many takes, it’s a good idea to take notes with a pen and 
paper or with the Logic Pro notepad (Option-⌘-P). Pay attention to what 
sounds good and what doesn’t.
	
3.	Use the pointer or the pencil tool to drag over the areas of the take 
you want in your comp.
	
	 Dragging over one take automatically deselects the same area of the 
other takes and updates the current comp.
In addition to dragging selections within takes, you can edit the comp in 
more advanced ways:
                           

237
 Chapter 14: Editing Audio Tracks
	
✓	Shorten a take section without extending the selection of other takes by 
Shift-dragging the take section. Shortening a take section leaves silence 
in between the two adjacent sections in the comp.
	
✓	Move the selection left or right by placing your cursor in the center of 
the section and dragging when the cursor becomes a two-headed arrow.
	
✓	Alternate sections between takes by clicking an empty section of a take. 
The take you click will become active, and the formerly active take will 
become inactive. Use this method to audition sections of takes quickly.
	
✓	Remove a section from the comp by Shift-clicking the section. To remove 
the entire take from the comp, Shift-click the take header.
Creating alternate comps
When you create a comp that you like, it’s a good idea to duplicate the comp 
for safekeeping. You might also want to try out different ideas. Follow these 
steps to create alternative comps:
	
1.	To the right of the take folder disclosure triangle, click the current 
comp indicator.
	
	 A pop-up menu appears that lets you select takes and gives you com­
mands for your comps and take folder.
	
2.	In the pop-up menu, choose Create New Comp or Duplicate Comp.
	
	 Your new or duplicate comp appears in the menu list, where you can 
select and edit it. The Create New Comp command is available only if 
you haven’t created a comp. After you’ve created a comp, the Duplicate 
Comp command is available.
After you’ve duplicated your comp, you can use the pop-up menu to select 
between the two comps as well as rename the comp. You can also delete the 
comp or delete all other comps except the current comp.
Editing take regions
	
	 You might want to edit take regions directly but not edit your comp. For 
example, you can change the start and end points of a take region or split the 
region in two. You can turn quick swipe comping on and off by clicking the 
take folder’s quick swipe comping icon (shown in the margin). When quick 
swipe comping is on, you can create and edit comps by dragging in the take 
regions, as described previously.
                           

238
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
When quick swipe comping is off, the icon shows a pair of scissors, and 
you can edit the regions directly. You can also do the following to your take 
regions when quick swipe comping mode is off:
	
✓	Select an individual take by clicking it.
	
✓	Change start and end points by dragging the lower edges of the take 
region.
	
✓	Slice a take at a comp section borders by Control-clicking and choosing 
Slice at Comp Section Borders in the pop-up menu.
	
✓	Trim takes at active comp section borders by Control-clicking and 
choosing Trim to Active Comp Section Borders in the pop-up menu.
	
✓	Move a take within its lane by dragging left or right.
	
✓	Move a take to a different lane by dragging the take to the new lane.
Packing and unpacking take folders
It’s not necessary to record multiple takes on a single track to use a take 
folder. You can create a take folder from any audio you have in your project. 
You can also remove takes from a take folder so that they play independently 
as regions on their own track.
To pack audio regions into a take folder, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the regions you want to pack into a take folder.
	
2.	Control-click a selected region, and choose Folder➪Pack Take Folder 
(Control-⌘-F) in the pop-up menu.
	
	 The regions are placed into a take folder on the topmost track.
You can do either of the following to unpack a take folder:
	
✓	Control-click the take folder header, and then choose Folder➪Unpack 
Take Folder to Existing Tracks (Control-⌘-U) or Folder➪Unpack Take 
Folder to New Tracks (Shift-Control-⌘-U).
	
✓	Click the current comp indicator to the right of the take folder disclo­
sure triangle, and then choose Unpack or Unpack to New Tracks.
In addition to packing and unpacking take folders, you can do the following in 
the take folder menu:
	
✓	Flatten: The current active comp replaces the take folder. Each take sec­
tion is its own region with crossfades added to the regions for smooth 
transitions between the regions.
                           

239
 Chapter 14: Editing Audio Tracks
	
✓	Flatten and merge: The current active comp replaces the take folder. 
Each take section is merged into a single audio file with only one region.
	
✓	Export the active comp to a new track: The current active comp is 
exported to a new track, leaving the original take folder unchanged. 
Each take section on the new track is in its own region with crossfades 
added to the regions.
	
✓	Move the active comp to a new track: The current active comp is 
exported to a new track, but the original take sections are removed from 
the take folder.
	
You can create a vocal double effect, a common music production technique, 
by creating different comps and exporting them to new tracks. If you have sev­
eral usable takes in a take folder, creating multiple comps and exporting them 
makes vocal doubling easy. And if the exported comps aren’t perfectly in tune 
or the timing is off, you can adjust them by using flex pitch and flex time, as 
you’re about to learn.
Time Traveling with Flex Time
When flex time was added to Logic Pro in 2009, it was one of those gasp-at-
the-possibilities moments. If you’ve ever been on a deadline and the record­
ing wasn’t going well, you probably wished you had something like flex time. 
You’ve come to Logic Pro at the right time, as you’re about to find out.
Flex time allows you to adjust the timing and groove of performances. You 
can fix mistakes, experiment, perfect important downbeats, and so much 
more. To enable flex time on a track in the tracks area, do the following:
	
1.	Choose Edit➪Show Flex Pitch/Time (⌘-F).
	
	 Flex icons appear on the track headers, as shown in Figure 14-4.
	
2.	Click the flex icon on the audio track you want to edit.
	
	 The flex menu appears on the track header.
You can enable flex time also from the audio track editor:
	
1.	Open the audio track editor by double-clicking an audio file or by 
selecting an audio file and choosing View➪Show Editor (E).
	
	 The audio track editor opens in the main window.
	
2.	Click the flex icon on the audio track editor menu bar.
	
	 The flex menu appears on the menu bar to the right of the flex icon.

Choosing flex time algorithms
After you’ve turned on flex mode, you can select an algorithm in the flex 
mode menu, which appears in the following places, to determine how your 
audio will be altered:
	
✓	Track inspector (see Figure 14-5)
	
✓	Track header 
	
✓	Audio track editor
You can also have Logic Pro analyze your audio and automatically choose the 
best algorithm for the audio material.

 Chapter 14: Editing Audio Tracks
	
✓	Automatic: Logic Pro analyzes your audio and selects between mono­
phonic, slicing, and rhythmic algorithms.
	
✓	Monophonic: Used for monophonic audio such as bass lines, lead sounds, 
and vocals. Click the Percussive check box if the audio is a percussive 
monophonic sound, such as a guitar or pitched percussion.
	
✓	Slicing: Used for percussive audio such as drums and percussion. Audio 
isn’t expanded or compressed with this algorithm, so moving audio can 
create gaps. Set the Decay time to compensate for gaps in the audio. 
Click the Fill Gaps check box to disable the decay time and remove any 
gaps. Set the Slice Length to shorten each slice by a percentage and 
adjust the gaps between slices.
	
✓	Rhythmic: Used for rhythmic audio such as guitars and keyboards. Set 
the Loop Length to adjust the length of the loop used at the end of the 
slice to fill the gap. Set the Decay value to adjust the decay of the loop. 
Set the Loop Offset to move the loop forward in time, preserving the 
attack of the transients that follow.
	
✓	Polyphonic: Used for polyphonic audio such as chords and full mixes. 
The polyphonic algorithm is the most processor intensive of all the algo­
rithms. Click the Complex check box to add more internal transients to 
the flex time processing.
	
✓	Speed (FX): Used for special effects, especially percussive material. This 
algorithm has no additional parameters.
	
✓	Tempophone (FX): Used for special effects based on granular synthesis 
techniques. Adjust the Grain Size used to compress and expand the 
audio. Adjust the Crossfade length to set the quality of the effect. Higher 
values produce softer effects, and lower values produce hard effects.
Using flex markers
You adjust the timing of your audio with flex markers. After you enable flex 
time editing, your audio is analyzed using the chosen algorithm and transient 
markers are added to your audio, as shown in Figure 14-6. You can use these 
markers to help you see where you need to adjust the timing.

Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Flex time editing can be done in the tracks area and in the audio track editor. 
Follow these steps to adjust the timing of your audio tracks with flex time:
	
1.	In the track header, click the flex icon to enable flex time editing.
	
	 Your audio is analyzed and transient markers are added to the region.
	
2.	Choose a flex time algorithm.
	
3.	Click the spot you want to adjust.
	
	 A flex marker is added to the track. You can use the transient markers to 
guide your editing, but you can also add flex markers to points without 
transient markers.
	
	 If you click the lower half of the region, multiple flex markers are added. 
In addition to the place you click, a marker is added to the left and right 
transients, making the flex editing more precise.
	
4.	Drag the marker to the left or right to adjust the timing.
	
	 The audio is compressed or expanded to fit the edit.
	
You can connect a flex marker to a transient in a region on an adjacent track, 
allowing you to tighten the timing between two separate tracks. Drag a flex 
marker up or down to a transient on another region until the line between the 
two regions turns yellow, and then release. Your track will be adjusted to the 
transient.
Using the flex tool
The tool menus in the tracks area and the audio track editor contain a flex 
tool to use on regions when flex editing isn’t shown. To use the flex tool on an 
audio region, do the following:
	
1.	Open the tool menu (T) and choose the Flex Tool.
	
2.	Drag the audio waveform to adjust the timing.
	
Remember the marquee tool in Chapter 13? It’s a great tool for flex editing. 
Create a selection with the marquee tool, and then drag the selection with the 
flex tool to adjust the timing. You can also click the selection with the pointer 
tool to create flex time markers from the selection and the closest transients. 
If you click in the upper half of the region, flex markers are added to the four 
positions: the edges of the selection and the nearest transients outside the 
selection. If you click in the lower half of the region, flex markers are added to 
three positions: the selection edges and the place you clicked.

 Chapter 14: Editing Audio Tracks
Tuning with Flex Pitch
Flex pitch is a new feature in Logic Pro X. It’s a good thing we were given seven 
years to come down from the glee of flex time before Logic Pro announced flex 
pitch. We needed to catch our breath.
Editing pitch isn’t anything new and a few companies have done a pretty 
good job implementing it. But flex pitch makes editing pitch simple thanks to 
its intuitive workflow and the fact that it’s built into Logic Pro X. To enable 
flex pitch on a track in the tracks area, follow these steps:
	
1.	In the tracks area menu bar, click the flex icon to enable flex editing.
	
	 Flex icons appear on the track headers.
	
2.	In the track header, click the flex icon.
	
	 Flex editing is now enabled on the track.
	
3.	On the Flex Mode menu in the track header or the track inspector, 
choose Flex Pitch.
	
	 The regions on the track display the flex pitch editing bars, as shown in 
Figure 14-7.
Figure 14-7: 
Flex pitch in 
the tracks 
area.
Editing pitch in the tracks area
After you enable flex pitch on a track, the region in the tracks area displays 
horizontal bars above or below each note. These bars show you how close 
or far away the pitch is from the center pitch, indicated by the horizontal 
center of the region. If a bar is above the center, the pitch is sharp. If a bar is 
below the center, the pitch is flat. To edit the pitch, drag the bars closer to 
the center.
	
You can speed up the editing process by Control-clicking the audio region and 
choosing Set All to Perfect Pitch on the menu. If you don’t like your edits, you 
can start fresh by choosing Set All to Original Pitch.
                           

244
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
You can adjust two flex pitch parameters from the track inspector:
	
✓	Formant Track: Formants are bands of frequencies that determine the 
sound quality of vowels. Drag up on the Formant Track field to increase 
the tracking interval.
	
✓	Formant Shift: This parameter adjusts how formants are affected by 
changes in pitch. You can get some cool vocal effects by setting the 
Formant Shift value to extremes. Positive values give you squeaky 
Mickey Mouse effects, and negative values give you deep-voiced Barry 
White effects. The formant shift parameter is fun to play with, and it 
helps you get more natural sounding flex pitch edits.
Editing pitch in the audio track editor
You can edit pitch also in the audio track editor, which provides a different 
flex pitch interface. The flex pitch presentation in the audio track editor is 
similar to the pitch presentation in the MIDI piano roll editor, and you have 
more control over the edited sound. To use flex pitch in the audio track 
editor, do the following:
	
1.	Double-click an audio region to open the audio track editor, or select 
the region and press E.
	
	 The audio track editor opens at the bottom of the main window.
	
2.	On the audio track editor menu bar, click the flex icon.
	
	 Flex editing is enabled on the track.
	
3.	On the Flex Mode menu on the audio track editor menu bar, choose 
Flex Pitch.
	
	 Flex pitch data is added to each note, as shown in Figure 14-8.

 Chapter 14: Editing Audio Tracks
Editing pitch event hot spots
In the audio track editor, flex pitch creates a blue rectangle for each note. 
The notes correspond to the piano keys to the left of the editor. Drag the rec-
tangle left, right, up, or down to adjust both time and pitch. You can also split 
the note with the scissors tool to create two notes or merge notes by using 
the glue tool. You can reset the pitch by Control-clicking the note and choos­
ing Set to Original Pitch.
As you hover your cursor over each rectangle, six hot spots become avail­
able so you can edit the following flex pitch parameters:
	
✓	Pitch Drift: The left and right hot spots at the top of the rectangle 
control the pitch drift at the beginning and end of the note. Use these 
parameters to allow the pitch to drift into or out of the note. These 
parameters are useful for keeping a natural feel to the pitch because 
singers often scoop into notes and fall out of notes.
	
✓	Fine Pitch: Use the top center hot spot to fine-tune the pitch.
	
✓	Gain: The bottom left hot spot controls the volume of the note.
	
✓	Vibrato: The bottom middle hot spot controls the pitch vibrato.
	
✓	Formant Shift: The bottom-right hot spot controls how formants are 
affected by the pitch shift.
	
Have you ever wished you could sing a melody and have it turned into MIDI or 
notation? Flex pitch lets you do that. After you’ve finished flex pitch editing, 
choose Edit➪Create MIDI Track from Flex Pitch Data on the audio track editor 
menu. A new software instrument track is created and the flex pitch data is 
added to a MIDI region as MIDI notes.
Quantizing the pitch and scale of a region
With flex pitch enabled in the audio track editor, you can have Logic Pro 
automatically quantize the pitch, scale, and time of a region. Choose View➪Show 
Local Inspector to view the quantization parameters. At the top of the inspector 
are the Time Quantize parameters, which enable you to choose the note value 
and strength of quantization. The Scale Quantization parameters enable you to 
choose the root note of the scale and the type of scale. All common scale modes 
are available along with other popular scale types and some more esoteric scales.
	
Flex pitch can do more than just fix pitch mistakes or inconsistencies. You 
can use it also to create new parts, such as vocal harmonies. In many cases, 
the parts you come up with will be perfectly useable. Sometimes, however, 
moving a pitch too far can sound unnatural, so adjust the formant parameters 
for better results. But even if you don’t keep the part, you can experiment and 
find out what will make your song sound stronger.

Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Editing Audio in the Audio File Editor
The audio file editor is new to Logic Pro X and replaces the sample editor 
from earlier versions of Logic Pro. You probably won’t need to use the audio 
file editor often because the audio track editor will usually be your first 
choice for editing audio. The audio file editor is reserved for more precise 
and permanent edits to audio files. You can open the audio file editor, shown 
in Figure 14-9, in the following ways:
	
✓	Choose View➪Show Editor or double-click an audio file and then click 
the File tab in the audio editor window.
	
✓	Choose Window➪Open Audio File Editor (⌘-6) to open the audio file 
editor in a new window.
	
Figure 14-9: 
The audio 
file editor.
	
It’s worth repeating that the audio file editor is a destructive editor, meaning 
it changes your audio permanently. Making copies and backups of files you 
intend to edit is good practice. You can
	
✓	Choose Audio File➪Create Backup (Control-B). A duplicate of the audio 
file is stored in the same location as the original file and given a .dup file 
extension.
	
✓	Choose Audio File➪Save A Copy As. A dialog opens where you can 
adjust the settings and location of the file before you click the Save 
button.
Navigating and playing audio
Playback in the audio file editor is independent from the project audio. That 
means the transport controls in the control bar don’t control the playback of 
files in the audio file editor. The audio editor is monitored through the pre­
listen channel strip in the mixer, shown in Figure 14-10. The prelisten channel 
strip adjusts the audio settings of files played in the audio file editor and proj­
ect audio browser.

Follow these steps to view the prelisten channel strip:
	
1.	Open the mixer in the tracks area (X) or in its own window (⌘-2).
	
	 You can open the mixer also by choosing View➪Show Mixer or Window➪
Open Mixer.
	
2.	On the mixer menu bar, click the All button to display all channel strips.
	
	 The Prelisten channel strip is located to the right of the last audio chan­
nel strip.
	
	 You can play audio files in the editor by clicking the prelisten icon (shown in 
the margin). Control-click the prelisten icon to choose to play audio through 
the prelisten channel strip or the track channel strip. In addition to the pre­
listen icon, you can play audio in the editor in the following ways:
	
✓	Press Control-Option-⌘-spacebar to play and stop the entire audio file.
	
✓	Press Shift-Control-Option-spacebar to play and stop the audio con­
tained in the region.
	
✓	Press Control-Option-spacebar to play and stop the region from the 
anchor position. The anchor position is used to determine the absolute 
start point of the audio file.
	
✓	Double-click the ruler to play and stop the audio file.
	
✓	Click-hold the waveform overview to start playback at the click location.
	
✓	Drag your cursor in the ruler to scrub the audio.
	
✓	Click the cycle icon to continuously repeat the selected audio.

Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
The audio file editor allows you to navigate to precise points in your audio 
file. Because the audio file editor is used for detailed editing, it’s important to 
have the capability to navigate around your audio file at the smallest level. To 
navigate your audio file, do one of the following:
	
✓	Click the waveform display to navigate to specific locations in the audio 
file.
	
✓	Choose Edit➪Go To and select the audio file location you want.
	
✓	Choose Functions➪Search Peak to find the loudest point in the audio file.
	
✓	Choose Functions➪Search Silence to find the first silent point in the 
audio file.
	
✓	Use the vertical and horizontal zoom sliders to adjust how much of your 
audio file you see in the editor window.
Selecting audio
To edit audio in the audio file editor, you need to select the audio in the edit­
ing window. The audio file editor gives you precise ways of selecting audio, 
down to the individual samples. You can select portions of your audio file in 
the following ways:
	
✓	Drag your cursor over the area you want to select.
	
✓	Choose Edit➪Select All (⌘-A).
	
✓	Choose Edit➪Select All Previous (Shift-Control-Option-left arrow).
	
✓	Choose Edit➪Select All Following (Shift-Control-Option-right arrow).
	
✓	Choose Edit➪Region -> Selection to select only the audio that is used in 
the region.
In addition to these basic ways of selecting parts of your audio file, you can 
use transient markers to make selections. Transient markers can make select­
ing and editing audio much faster. To select audio using transients:
	
	
1.	 On the menu bar, click the transient editing mode icon (see the margin).
	
	 The audio is analyzed for transients, and markers are added.
	
2.	Double-click between two markers or use one of the commands on the 
Edit➪Set menu.
The start and end points of your selection are shown in the info display on 
the menu. You change the format of the information by selecting one of the 
following modes from the View menu:
	
✓	Samples
	
✓	Min:Sec:Ms

Editing audio
In the audio file editor, you can do basic editing, such as copying and past­
ing, or more advanced editing, such as fading in and out and removing pops 
and clicks. Use the audio file editor, as opposed to the audio track editor, to 
accomplish more detailed, permanent edits.
From the Edit menu, you can copy, cut, paste, and delete. Copied audio is 
put on the clipboard for pasting to a new location. Cutting audio pulls all the 
audio after the cut forward and places the selection on the clipboard. Pasting 
audio occurs at the clicked location and makes room for the paste by push­
ing back all the audio that follows. Deleting audio is similar to cutting except 
the selected contents aren’t copied to the clipboard.
After you have selected some audio, you can choose several editing com­
mands on the Functions menu. Here are some common editing functions:
	
✓	Silence: Remove all sound. Be careful when you silence audio because 
too much silence can make an audio recording sound unnatural. In many 
cases, it’s better to lower the gain by using the Change Gain function. 
Silencing audio is better at the beginning or ending of audio files or 
when you need to remove an unwanted artifact.
	
✓	Reverse: Make the sound play backwards. If you’ve ever wanted to create 
a reverse cymbal crash sound to swell into a section, you’ll love this com­
mand. It’s also useful for making clean versions of explicit vocal parts.
	
✓	Remove DC Offset: Center the waveform and remove potential cracks 
and pops that DC (direct current) offset can produce. Use this function 
if your audio hardware introduces DC offset into your audio. DC offset is 
clearly visible on your audio waveforms by a vertical shift in the wave­
form display.
	
✓	Trim: Remove everything except your selected audio.
The pencil tool is probably the most useful tool for removing pops and clicks 
from your audio. To use the pencil tool, you’ll need to zoom in closely on the 
area you want to edit. If you’re not zoomed in enough, clicking the waveform 
with the pencil will automatically change it to the zoom tool, a nice hint that 
you’re not zoomed in enough. After you’re zoomed in enough, drag from left 
to right to draw in the new waveform.
	
You can set Logic Pro to edit your audio in external editor:
	
1.	Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Audio.
	
	 The Audio Preferences window opens.

L

ogic Pro began as a MIDI sequencer. Even today, it stands alone in its 
superior handling of MIDI data. MIDI is much more flexible than audio. 
You can change sounds, notes, velocity, and length, and tweak until you’re 
happy. Yes, Logic Pro can make you happy.
MIDI has many benefits. The small file sizes make it easy to share and use 
when space is a concern, such as in game music. It’s an excellent tool for 
composition, film scoring, and music notation. Unlike acoustic instruments, 
MIDI controllers can take the shape of keyboards, drums pads, wind instru­
ments, and guitars and other stringed instruments, but they can sound like 
anything at all. And MIDI makes music preproduction much easier because 
you can build songs before you record them.
In this chapter, you take advantage of your MIDI studio. You discover how to 
input and edit MIDI, learn timesaving editing tips, and make your music look 
and sound exactly how you want.
Knowing Your MIDI Editors
The piano roll editor, shown in Figure 15-1, is the default Logic Pro MIDI 
editor. It has the most features and is designed for speed and complete con­
trol. Inspired by player pianos, which use grid-based punch cards to make 
music, this editor is user friendly and your go-to MIDI editor. To open the 
piano roll editor, do one of the following:
	
✓	Double-click a MIDI region.
	
✓	Choose View➪Show Editor or press E with a MIDI region selected.
                           

252

✓	Choose Window➪Open Piano Roll or press ⌘-4 to open the piano roll 
editor in a new window.
	
Figure 15-1: 
The piano 
roll editor.
	
The score editor, shown in Figure 15-2, is the choice for notation and tradi­
tional music representation. It is great for composition and scoring, and is a 
requirement for getting your music played by other professional musicians. If 
you enjoy reading music, you’ll appreciate the score editor. To open the score 
editor, you can
	
✓	Double-click a MIDI region to open the MIDI editors, and then click the 
Score tab.
	
✓	Choose View➪Show Editor with a MIDI region selected, and then click 
the Score tab or press N.
	
✓	Choose Window➪Open Score Editor or press ⌘-5 to open the score 
editor in a new window.

 Chapter 15: Editing MIDI Tracks
The step editor, shown in Figure 15-3, works well at building musical patterns, 
especially drum patterns. It mimics step sequencers, in which you build a 
sequence of notes by using a grid. Even though it’s grid-based like the piano 
roll editor, the step editor has a different layout that allows you to quickly 
edit MIDI event types other than notes, such as velocity or MIDI controller 
data. To open the step editor, do the following:
	
✓	Double-click a MIDI region to open the MIDI editors, and then click the 
Step Editor tab.
	
✓	Choose View➪Show Editor with a MIDI region selected, and then click 
the Step Editor tab.
	
✓	Choose Window➪Open Step Editor to open the step editor in a new 
window.
	
Figure 15-3: 
The step 
editor.
	
The event list editor, shown in Figure 15-4, might not be the most attractive 
MIDI editor, but it’s probably the most complete editor, listing every MIDI 
event you record. To open the event list editor, you can
	
✓	Choose View➪Show List Editors with a MIDI region selected, and then 
click the Event tab or press D.
	
✓	Choose Window➪Open Event List to open the event list editor in a new 
window or press ⌘-7.
The MIDI environment, shown in Figure 15-5, used to be a more fundamental, 
and often intimidating, part of the Logic Pro workflow. With Logic Pro X, the 
environment has been pushed into the background, but you wouldn’t be able to 
sequence without it. The MIDI environment is integral to the input and output of 
your audio and MIDI. Do one of the following to open the MIDI environment:
	
✓	Choose Window➪Open MIDI Environment to open the MIDI environment 
in a new window.
	
✓	Press ⌘-0 to open the MIDI environment window.

The MIDI transform window, shown in Figure 15-6, alters your MIDI and can save 
you from time-consuming and repetitive editing tasks. Whenever you want to 
automate the transformation of large amounts of MIDI data, use the MIDI trans­
form window. You can open the MIDI transform window in a couple of ways:
	
✓	Choose Window➪Open MIDI Transform to open the MIDI Transform 
window in a new window.
	
✓	Press ⌘-9 to open the MIDI transform window.
	
Figure 15-6:

To enable the full MIDI editing features of Logic Pro X, you must have Show 
Advanced Tools selected in the Advanced Preferences pane. Choose Logic Pro 
X➪Preferences➪Advanced Tools, and then select Show Advanced Tools and 
the other additional options.
Editing MIDI in the Piano Roll Editor
In the piano roll editor, MIDI notes are displayed as colored bars on a grid, as 
shown in Figure 15-7. MIDI notes correspond to a vertical keyboard on the left 
side of the editor. Like the tracks area, there’s a time grid, a ruler, and a menu 
bar to help you locate your position in the project and make precise edits.

Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
	
Figure 15-7: 
The piano 
roll editor.
	
	
You can show the global tracks or just the marker track in the piano roll editor 
by clicking the hide/show global tracks or hide/show marker track icon above 
the piano roll keyboard. Showing the global tracks is particularly useful when 
you’re viewing the piano roll editor in a separate window from the tracks area.
Adding and editing notes
In addition to recording MIDI (see Chapter 7) you can add notes directly in the 
piano roll editor with the pencil tool by clicking the location on the grid where 
you want to create the note. New notes are created using the same length as 
the previously created note or currently selected note. You can adjust the 
length of a note as you create it by holding and dragging the note.
Edit MIDI notes just like you edit a region (described in Chapter 4). You can 
drag the ends of the notes to resize them. Copy notes by Option-clicking and 
then dragging the note to the new position. Delete notes by selecting the note 
and then pressing Delete.
The piano roll editor makes selecting notes easy by providing several com­
mands in the Edit➪Select menu. You can select the highest and lowest notes 
and select overlapped notes. You can also move to the previous note (Option-
left arrow) and the next note (Option-right arrow).
                           

257
 Chapter 15: Editing MIDI Tracks
After you have selected the notes you want to edit, you can move them left 
or right on the grid by choosing Edit➪Move➪Nudge Left or Nudge Right. You 
can move them up or down a semitone or an octave by choosing the appro­
priate option on the Edit➪Transpose menu.
	
When you’re starting out with Logic Pro, it’s a good idea to display Quick Help. 
Click the quick help icon in the control bar or choose Help➪Quick Help. Quick 
Help shows you the name and function of anything your cursor hovers over. 
The quick help window is displayed at the top of your inspector or in a movable 
floating window if the inspector isn’t open. Quick help is useful when you can’t 
remember what all the nameless icons do in the menu bar and other areas.
Editing the velocity of notes
Inside each note bar is a line that indicates the velocity level, which deter­
mines how loud or soft a note will be played. Longer lines indicate higher 
velocity. If you hover your cursor over a note, a help tag displays the pitch 
and the exact velocity level. You can edit the note velocity in these ways:
	
✓	Click a note and drag up or down with the velocity tool. Editing velocity 
is the parameter you will probably edit secondmost, after pitch, so set 
the velocity tool as your ⌘-click tool. For details on setting the ⌘-click 
tool, see Chapter 3.
	
✓	Select the notes and drag the Velocity slider in the piano roll local 
inspector. If the local inspector isn’t displayed, choose View➪Show 
Local Inspector on the piano roll editor menu.
	
✓	You can set all the selected notes to the same velocity by pressing Shift-
Option while dragging any one of the notes with the velocity tool.
	
✓	Use MIDI Draw to edit the velocity by choosing View➪Midi Draw➪Note 
Velocity. MIDI Draw is covered later in this section.
	
To select multiple notes of the same velocity, select one note, Control-click the 
note, and then choose Select Equal Colored Regions/Events (Shift-C).
Quantizing notes
Got timing problems? Not anymore. As described in Chapter 14, Logic Pro X 
can quantize your audio, which is pretty amazing. But MIDI data is even 
more flexible because it won’t suffer from audio artifacts after you adjust the 
timing. You can adjust the quantization of notes in the following ways:
	
✓	Select the notes you want to quantize and use the Time Quantize param­
eters in the piano roll local inspector. Adjust the Strength slider to make 
the quantization sound more natural and not too perfect. Use the Swing 
slider to adjust the level of swing feel.

Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
	
✓	Select and click notes with the Quantize tool. The quantize note value is 
chosen on the Time Quantize menu in the local inspector.
	
✓	Select the notes you want to quantize and choose Functions➪Quantize 
Notes or press Q.
	
Quantizing is nondestructive, so you can undo the quantization by choosing 
Functions➪Undo Quantization or pressing Shift-⌘-Q.
Muting notes
The jazz legend Thelonious Monk once said, “What you don’t play can be 
more important that what you do.” If MIDI sequencing were around when 
he said it, he could have been talking about muting notes. You can be sure 
that Monk would have loved muting notes. To mute and unmute notes in the 
piano roll editor, do one of the following:
	
✓	Use the mute tool to click the note you want to mute or unmute. You can 
tell when notes are muted because they have no color. You can mute and 
unmute several notes at once by selecting the notes and clicking with 
the mute tool.
	
✓	Select the notes you want to mute or unmute, and choose Functions➪Mute 
Notes on/off or press Control-M.
	
You can select all the notes of the same pitch by clicking the corresponding 
key in the piano roll keyboard. You can select multiple notes by Shift-clicking 
the keys in the piano roll keyboard. You can also select all muted notes by 
choosing Edit➪Select➪Muted Notes or by pressing Shift-M.
Using MIDI draw
Choose an option on the View➪MIDI Draw menu and a lane opens at the 
bottom of the piano roll editor, as shown in Figure 15-8. This MIDI draw lane 
makes it easy to graphically draw and edit MIDI controller data. MIDI draw is 
especially useful for quickly editing the velocity of multiple note events.
Figure 15-8: 
The MIDI 
draw lane.
                           

259
 Chapter 15: Editing MIDI Tracks
In the MIDI draw lane, click where you want to add MIDI controller data. You 
can click and drag in the lane to create smooth lines for multiple controller 
points to follow. All corresponding MIDI notes in the piano roll editor will be 
updated with the new controller data. Another common use for MIDI draw is 
editing sustain pedal events.
Editing MIDI in the Step Editor
The hyper editor has been renamed as the step editor, which as you’ll see 
makes sense. If you’ve played with a drum machine or Ultrabeat, you’ll get 
the hang of the step editor quickly. The step editor is unbeatable at program­
ming drum patterns but, you can use it in other creative ways too. It’s unpar­
alleled at organizing sounds and other MIDI events rhythmically.
Creating and editing steps
Steps are represented as vertical beams within the lanes, as shown in 
Figure 15-9. Each step represents MIDI events such as note events or other 
controller data. The height of the step determines the value of the MIDI 
event. To create steps, use the pencil tool to click where you want the step. 
Drag the step up or down to change the value. You can create multiple steps 
by dragging horizontally through the lane.

the step 
editor.
	
                           

260
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Edit the value of steps by dragging the event up or down with the pointer 
tool or the pencil tool. You can copy, cut, paste, and delete events just as 
you would in the other editors. You can also edit steps by using the Edit and 
Functions menu in the step editor menu bar.
	
You can edit the values of multiple steps at once by using the line tool. Drag 
horizontally through the lane to edit the step values.
Creating and editing lanes
Step editor lanes can show more than just note events. You can assign a lane 
to show MIDI controller data such as modulation or velocity, and you can 
adjust how steps are displayed within the lane. To create a new lane, choose 
Lanes➪Create Lane. Edit the lane parameters in the lane inspector (refer to 
the bottom left in Figure 15-9). If the lane inspector isn’t shown, press I.
Here’s a description of the parameters in the lane inspector:
	
✓	Name: Click the lane header to name the selected lane.
	
✓	Grid: Choose the note length of the steps in the lane.
	
✓	Pen Width: Choose the width of steps in the lane.
	
✓	Style: Choose how the steps are displayed in the lane.
	
✓	Delay: Move all events in the lane forward or backward in time.
	
✓	Length: Choose the length of new events that are created.
	
✓	Status: Choose the event type.
	
✓	Channel: Choose the MIDI channel of the lane.
	
✓	Pitch/Number: This parameter depends on the event type selected in 
the Status parameter.
	
You can use multiple lanes for the same instrument. This allows you to quickly 
create eighth-note hi-hat patterns in one lane and sixteenth-note hi-hat pat­
terns in a separate lane.
Creating and editing lane sets
Lane sets are groups of lanes that you can save and recall. Changing a lane 
set doesn’t affect the data in the lanes, so you can freely try out different 
lane sets without editing your MIDI data. To create a new lane set, choose 
Lanes➪New Lane Set. Choose a different lane set by clicking the name of the 
current lane set in the inspector. A pop-up menu enables you to choose from 
a list of presets or lane set commands.
                           

261
 Chapter 15: Editing MIDI Tracks
	
If you want to create a lane set from the events in a MIDI region, select the 
events in the piano roll editor first, and then choose Lanes➪New Lane Set 
from Current Events on the step editor menu. All MIDI events will be added to 
separate lanes in the step editor.
Editing MIDI in the Score Editor
A thorough discussion of the score editor requires several chapters if not 
an entire book. The rules of professional music notation aren’t set in stone. 
Music publishers have different notation styles, but one thing is fairly certain: 
Logic Pro can produce high-quality music engraving quickly.
	
The score editor quantizes your notation visually without actually quantizing 
the underlying MIDI data. This allows you to change the way notation looks 
without changing how it sounds.
Creating and editing notes in the score
You can add notes in the score editor using the pencil tool and the step input 
keyboard. To add notes with the pencil tool:
	
1.	Select a MIDI region in the tracks area and open the score editor.
	
2.	Press I to open the Inspector.
	
3.	Choose a note value from the Part Box in the inspector, as shown in 
Figure 15-10.
	
	 If you don’t see notes in the parts box, click either the All button or the 
notes icon in the parts box.
	
4.	Click the location where you want to add the note using the pencil tool.
	
	 A new MIDI note is added to the region. You can also drag notes to the 
score directly from the part box.
To add notes using the step input keyboard:
	
1.	Select a MIDI region in the tracks area and open the score editor.
	
2.	Choose Window➪Show Step Input Keyboard or press Option-⌘-K.
	
	 The step input keyboard opens, as shown in Figure 15-11.
	
3.	Choose a note value from the step input keyboard.
	
4.	Move the playhead to the position you want to add the note.
	
5.	Click the note you want to add on the step input keyboard.
	
	 A note is added to the region.

Using the pointer tool, you can select and move notes left or right in the bar 
or up and down to change the pitch. You can change a selected note’s length 
and velocity from the Event inspector, as shown in Figure 15-12. You can also 
quantize the MIDI note event, as opposed to editing only the visual quantiza­
tion, using the Time Quantize parameters in the score editor local inspector. 
To view the local inspector choose View➪Show Local Inspector.

Investigating the score region inspector
Every region in the tracks area can have different display properties in the score 
editor. You change these properties in the score editor region inspector, as 
shown in Figure 15-13. Here’s a description of the region inspector parameters:
	
✓	Style: Choose the staff style for the selected track. Staff styles determine 
how the MIDI data is displayed in the score editor. For example, you 
can choose a bass staff style for a bass track or a piano style for a piano 
track. The staff style will determine the clef, transposition, and other dis­
play parameters.
	
✓	Quantize: Choose the minimum note value that is displayed in the score 
editor. The quantize value only determines the display in the score 
editor and doesn’t edit the actual MIDI data.
	
✓	Interpretation: Select the interpretation check box to make the score 
more readable instead of presenting the MIDI data precisely as it’s 
sequenced. For example, shorter note values like sixteenth notes are 
often rounded up when interpretation is selected. It’s a good idea to 
deselect interpretation when inputting notes using the step input key­
board or pencil tool.
	
✓	Syncopation: Select the syncopation check box to make syncopated 
rhythms more readable in the score editor. When syncopation is 
selected, tied notes will be shown as single notes.
	
✓	No Overlap: Select the No Overlap check box to shorten notes that over­
lap and make them more readable.
	
✓	Max Dots: The Max Dots field allows you to choose the maximum 
number of dotted notes in the score.

Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Adding items from the part box
You can add a lot more than just notes to the score editor. In order to make 
your scores more meaningful to the reader, you can add symbols, text, chords, 
and much more. For example, you can add accents to notes or change the 
note heads themselves. To add symbols to notes, drag the symbol you want 
to add from the part box onto the note. To add symbols to multiple notes, 
select the notes and then drag the symbol from the part box onto any one of 
the notes.
Many of the symbols can be added to any location in the score. For example, 
dynamic marks can be added to tell the player how loud or soft to play the 
part. Simply drag the dynamic symbol you want to add from the part box 
onto the score.
The score editor is a fantastic resource and worth exploring in detail. You can 
add chords to your score, including guitar tablature. You can also add text and 
lyrics to produce lead sheets for performing or copywriting. If you want an 
in-depth tour of the score editor, visit http://logicstudiotraining.com/

Editing MIDI in the MIDI 
Transform Window
The MIDI transform window can save you hours of tedious MIDI editing. 
Whenever you find yourself clicking a lot, open the MIDI transform window 
and get ready to be amazed. Just a little planning can make your MIDI editing 
go faster and get you back to creating music.
To edit MIDI using the MIDI transform window, follow these steps:
	
1.	Select a region or MIDI events within a region.
	
2.	Press ⌘-9.
	
	 The MIDI transform window opens, as shown in Figure 15-14.
	
3.	On the Presets menu, choose a preset.
	
4.	Click Operate Only.
	
	 Your selected MIDI is transformed according to the preset.
                           

265
 Chapter 15: Editing MIDI Tracks
	
Figure 15-14: 
The MIDI 
transform 
window.
	
In addition to the Operate Only button, two other buttons determine how the 
MIDI transform window behaves:
	
✓	Select Only: Click the Select Only button to select MIDI events that meet 
the criteria in the transform window. Selecting MIDI events before you 
operate on them is useful when you want to double-check that your 
transform parameters are set up correctly.
	
✓	Select and Operate: It’s not necessary to select the MIDI events in a 
region before you transform them. You can tell the transform window 
to select MIDI that meets your criteria, and then transform the MIDI by 
clicking Select and Operate.
	
You can also open the MIDI transform window from the piano roll editor by 
choosing Functions➪Midi Transform and selecting any function in the list.
Using transform presets
You can choose from several MIDI transform presets on the Presets drop-
down menu. Here’s a description of some of the presets you might want to 
consider using:
	
✓	Humanize: Introduce a range of random velocity, position, and length to 
your MIDI notes. This preset is perfect for MIDI that has been entered by 
using the step input keyboard or the pencil tool precisely on the grid.
                           

266
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
	
✓	Crescendo: Make your MIDI gradually get louder. This preset is useful 
when building dynamics into your arrangement. You can easily turn this 
preset into a decrescendo, the opposite of a crescendo, by reversing the 
velocity values.
	
✓	Maximum Note Length: Use on drum parts that have note values longer 
than a sixteenth note. Because most drum samples are triggered as one-
shot samples and don’t need to be sustained, limiting the note length 
makes the MIDI easier to read.
	
✓	Velocity Limiter: Reduce the minimum and maximum velocity of your 
MIDI. This preset can be useful when your MIDI controller has too much 
or too little keyboard sensitivity.
Creating transform presets
You can create your own MIDI transform presets from your own settings. To 
create a MIDI transform preset:
	
1.	On the Presets menu, choose Create Initialized User Set.
	
	 A dialog asks if you want to create a new preset or rename the current 
preset.
	
2.	Click Create.
	
	 The MIDI transform window is initialized to the default settings.
	
3.	In the MIDI transform window, set the conditions and operations.
	
	 The Logic Pro manual describes in detail the transform window’s condi­
tions and operations. Open the manual by choosing Help➪Logic Pro Help.
	
4.	On the Presets menu, click the preset name and then rename your 
preset.
	
5.	Press Enter.
	
	 Your new MIDI transform preset is renamed, saved, and added to the menu.
Editing MIDI in the Event List Editor
The event list editor isn’t pretty, but it is the most complete MIDI editor. It 
can often be the best editor when you want to change things directly, without 
a graphical user interface to interpret your MIDI data.
                           

267
 Chapter 15: Editing MIDI Tracks
Displaying events
The buttons at the top of the list editor, shown in Figure 15-15, filter the differ­
ent event types. Click the buttons to hide or show the corresponding events 
in the list area.

The event 
list editor.
	
	
If you click the leave folder icon at the top left of the event list editor, you can 
display all the regions and folders in your project.
Creating and editing events
You can create events by clicking the add event icon (plus sign) above the 
list area. Choose the event type you want to create by clicking the event type 
menu to the right of the add event icon. New events are added at the play­
head position.
                           

268
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Selected events can be edited on the Edit and Functions menus. You can also 
edit events in the list area by dragging parameters up and down or double-
clicking the parameter and entering the value directly.
	
You can create an event that will change screensets in your project at a spe­
cific time. (For more on screensets, see Chapter 3.) Choose Meta Event on the 
event type menu and add an event. Enter 49 in the Num column, and enter the 
screenset number in the Val column. You might use this meta event to force 
your project to always begin with a certain screenset, such as a large project 
notes window. Or maybe you need to switch between the score editor for 
reading music and a large global track display for reading lyrics as you record. 
Another useful meta event is number 52, which automatically stops playback.
Editing Your MIDI Environment
The Logic Pro MIDI environment used to be the main place to build a MIDI 
project and connect your virtual environment. In Logic Pro X, the MIDI envi­
ronment does its work behind the scenes, leaving you to make music. But if 
you like to tinker, you’ll like the MIDI environment.
The environment contains three basic types of objects:
	
✓	Input objects: Two input objects are available. The physical input repre­
sents the inputs of your MIDI interfaces. The sequencer input represents 
the Logic Pro input. You can have only one physical and one sequencer 
input per project.
	
✓	Instrument objects: Instrument objects represent the MIDI devices you 
have connected to Logic Pro.
	
✓	All other objects: Many other objects are available in the environment 
that create and control MIDI data and signal flow, such as faders, knobs, 
and switches.
Every object that you see in your project is contained in the MIDI environ­
ment. Your software instrument tracks, audio tracks, and outputs all have 
corresponding objects in the MIDI environment. You don’t need to do any­
thing with these objects, but if you want to do things such as transform the 
MIDI that comes into Logic Pro, you can do that in the MIDI environment.
Exploring object parameters
With the MIDI environment open, you can select objects and adjust their 
parameters. To view an object’s parameters, open the object inspector by 
pressing I. Every object has a name, an icon, and an Assignable check box, as 
                           

269
 Chapter 15: Editing MIDI Tracks
shown in Figure 15-16. The assignable parameter makes objects available for 
reassignment in the tracks area. For example, you could reassign a track to a 
different object in the MIDI environment by Control-clicking the track header 
and choosing the assignment on the Reassign Track menu.
	
Figure 15-16: 
The MIDI 
environ-
ment object 
inspector.
	
Other parameters depend on the object selected. Many of the parameters 
will be similar to what you’ve experienced with the other MIDI editors. You 
can choose MIDI channels, values, inputs and outputs, and more. The Logic 
Pro manual, available by choosing Help➪Logic Pro Help, will give you a list of 
every MIDI environment object and its parameters.
Viewing environment layers
The MIDI environment puts objects on different layers to help organize 
objects. You choose the layer on the Layer drop-down menu at the top of the 
inspector. You can also create, rename, and delete layers by using the same 
menu. Objects aren’t required to be on a specific layer. You are free to move 
and copy objects between layers in the following ways:
	
✓	To move an object to a new layer, select the object you want to move 
and hold down Option while selecting the new layer. The object will be 
moved to the new layer. If the object is connected to another object in 
the original layer, the connection will be preserved.
	
✓	To copy an object to a new layer, select the object and press ⌘-C, and 
then select the new layer and press ⌘-V. The pasted object will also pre­
serve connections to objects in other layers.
                           

270
Part IV: Arranging and Editing Your Project 
Inserting objects in the environment
You can add new objects by using the New menu. The object you choose will 
be added to the current layer. You can rename your objects by using the text 
tool or by editing the name in the object inspector. You can move objects by 
dragging the object’s name or by Shift-dragging the object.
One cool thing that I’ve taught Logic Pro users to do with the environment is 
create a generative music machine. This machine makes music that’s always 
changing and composed in real time. You can use this machine to create 
unique, ambient soundscapes, add excitement and unpredictable elements 
to your arrangements, and generate new melodic and harmonic ideas for fur­
ther composition. The subject is beyond the scope of this book, but if you’re 
interested, visit http://logicstudiotraining.com/lpxfordummies to

ixing is so much fun that a lot of Logic Pro users begin mixing before 
they begin writing a song. So many cool effects and faders and knobs 
are available to entertain us. The excitement keeps Logic Pro users hooked 
and coming back for more. Mixing is taking all your parts, blending them, and 
delivering the result to your audience in a cohesive whole. Ultimately, mixing 
is all about controlling and directing the experience of the music.
In this chapter, you discover the fundamental concepts of mixing audio to 
create an experience. You learn the best practices for setting levels and mea­
suring volume, taking guesswork out of balancing your tracks. You find out 
how to overcome the most common challenges of mixing and how to produce 
professional sounding audio.
	
If you’re a laptop artist and you write, arrange, edit, and mix your project as 
you go, hold your mix loosely until you’ve settled on the rest. You’re going to 
discover cool sounds by design and by accident, and you should save them as 
patches so you can come back to them later. However, you might want to start 
mixing from scratch after you’ve settled on all your parts. Sometimes a clean 
slate is faster to mix than a full plate.
Understanding Important 
Mixing Concepts
Audio engineering confuses a lot of beginners. It’s part art and part sci­
ence. When you understand the core concepts, you can get good mixing 
results without years of trial and error. In this section, I show you the nine 
                           

274
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
fundamentals of mixing audio. If you visit http://logicstudiotraining.
com/lpxfordummies, you can download a video guide in which I demon­
strate these core concepts visually.
Mindset
The mixing head game can keep beginners from producing quality mixes. What 
should you focus on? How can you take all your tracks and make them sound 
good? I believe that if you focus your mind in the right direction, your mix will 
come together and satisfy your artistic needs and the needs of your listener.
When you’re mixing a project, the first thing to consider is your audience. 
Decide the people for whom you’re producing this project as well as the final lis­
teners. Music is a subjective art, and many beginners make the mistake of trying 
to please the wrong people. If you’re working for a client, please the client and 
the client’s audience. Here are some questions to ask yourself and your client:
	
✓	What other music does the audience listen to? If you know the musical 
interests of your listeners, you’ll have a target sound that you can emu­
late or complement. Gather a reference list of music that engages your 
listeners and make notes on how you can achieve a similar or comple­
mentary sound.
	
✓	Does the project have a specific concept? Many music projects need to 
achieve a specific vibe or concept. If you need to go after an emotion or 
a distinct sound, knowing the concept will help you set the criteria for 
success. If more than one person is working on the project, having a spe­
cific concept also helps you work together and avoid disagreements.
	
✓	Does the project have boundaries or limitations? For example, a com­
mercial jingle might require exactly 30 seconds of music. A band might 
have only four pieces with one singer. The project could have a solid 
deadline. These boundaries keep you from experimenting too far and 
help you to sharpen your focus.
	
Your first goal is to take the raw tracks and make them sound adequate. After 
you’ve achieved a tolerable mix, you can work on elevating it until it sounds 
really good. Your final step is to stabilize the mix until it sounds polished and 
professional. But remember that you will never think it’s perfect, and that’s 
okay!
Acoustics
The biggest challenge to achieving a stable and professional mix is the acous­
tics of your listening environment, including the gear you use and the room 
where you listen. A pair of quality monitors with an even frequency response 
                           

275
 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
is important. The room that you listen in can potentially add or subtract fre­
quencies and give you an inaccurate picture of the sound. Here are some sug­
gestions for making the most of your gear and listening environment:
	
✓	Measure your room and calculate the room modes. Search online for a 
room mode calculator to do the math for you. You’re looking for areas in 
the frequency spectrum where your room creates buildups of frequen­
cies or gaps in frequencies. This knowledge can help you adjust for the 
room’s limitations.
	
✓	Position your speakers and listening position in an equilateral triangle. 
Find the sweet spot where your ears are equally distant between the 
two speakers, as shown in Figure 16-1. Also consider placing your speak­
ers away from walls. Having speakers too close to the back wall of your 
room can create a boomy sound.
	
✓	Consider treating your room with absorptive and diffusive material. 
Acoustic foam placed strategically throughout your room can help 
absorb and diffuse reflections of sound against the walls and give you a 
much clearer picture of what you’re hearing. Furniture and heavy cur­
tains also help break up audio reflections.
	
✓	Listen in multiple locations through multiple audio systems. If you 
want to get a clear picture of what other listeners will hear, play your 
mix through common consumer systems in addition to your optimized 
system and location. iPod earbuds, laptop speakers, and car stereos are 
some of the most common audio systems that listeners use. Michael 
Brauer, the engineer for artists such as Coldplay and John Mayer, is 
famous for doing a big chunk of his mixing on a 90s Sony boombox.

Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
You don’t have to spend thousands of dollars or hire acoustic specialists to 
significantly improve your acoustics. Spending an hour or two optimizing your 
room and listening position and calculating room modes will give you a practi­
cal advantage as you mix your music.
Balance
With your new mixing mindset and optimized acoustics, you’re ready to 
begin the technical part of mixing. The first step is to adjust the relative 
levels of your tracks to get an appropriate balance. Different genres of music 
have different approaches to balance, and it helps to study the genre of 
music you’re mixing to get a feel for the approach. But a general rule is that 
one track should have the ultimate focus at a time. Soloists and lead vocals 
are generally more prominent than the rest of the tracks.
A critical component to balance is loudness. Here’s what you need to remem­
ber about loudness: The human ear doesn’t hear all frequencies equally. The 
ear is more sensitive to frequencies centered around the human voice and 
less sensitive to lower and higher frequencies. That means if you’re listening 
to music quietly, the vocals are going to stick out more than the bass guitar or 
high strings. To compensate for the loudness contour of the human ear, you 
have to monitor music at a level where the frequencies become more equal.
The film industry has been calibrating the monitoring level to 83 dB SPL for 
decades because it produces a consistent product and allows audio engineers 
to create balances that account for the loudness contour of the human ear. Best 
of all, with today’s technology, it’s easy to calibrate your own monitoring level 
and make mixing even easier. Here’s how to calibrate your monitoring level:
	
1.	Get a sound-level meter.
	
	 You can find inexpensive sound-level meters online or at electronics 
stores. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you can find many free or paid 
sound-level meters in the app store.

 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
After you’ve calibrated the monitoring level of your listening position to 83 dB, 
you’ll have a much easier time getting balances. You don’t have to always listen 
at this level, but whenever you are adjusting the volume of individual tracks, 
set your monitor gain to the calibrated position.
Panning
Everyone in the music business knows that, for better or worse, the world 
revolves around lead singers. But in the mix, the world revolves around 
drummers. The drums and drum machines are giant instruments that take up 
the low end, the high end, and all the other ends. When it comes to the stereo 
spectrum, the drums also take up the left side, right side, and center. One of 
the first questions you ask yourself regarding the panning of your mix is, are 
the drums in drummer perspective or audience perspective?
Putting your drums in audience perspective is the most common technique. 
You, as the mixer, take the perspective of the audience and pan the drums 
as you would see them on stage. Kick and snare go in the center, hi-hat goes 
a little to the right, toms are panned right to left from hi to low, and cym­
bals are spread just as you see them in the Drum Kit instrument, shown in 
Figure 16-2. Drummer perspective is the reverse of audience perspective and 
a valid option. You can spread the drums wide or keep them closer to mono. 
What you do with drums often helps you with the rest of the mix.

Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
What if you don’t have drums in your mix? Panning is still often associated with 
the natural acoustic setup of the instruments. An orchestra is panned as you 
see it on the stage. Electronic dance music treats panning similarly to other pop 
music, except without extreme panning, which doesn’t translate well in a club.
After you’ve decided on the mix perspective, create clarity and balance from 
left to right with an equal distribution of rhythmic and frequency activity. Aim 
for no gaping holes between nine and three o’clock on your pan knobs. You 
learn exactly how to adjust the pan balance later in the chapter.
Frequency
Panning covers left and right, balance covers front to back, and frequency 
covers the high and low dimensions of the mix. You don’t need to balance 
each frequency range by making sure they’re all equally as loud. Instead, you 
need to make them present in a way that best represents your vision and the 
marketplace. Hip-hop must have low end. Pop needs to translate to average 
systems. Jazz must sound natural, and classical must sound transparent.
If you record your project well, you might not need to use a lot of EQ. Extreme 
EQ can disturb your balance because you’re raising or lowering the volume 
level of frequencies. It’s probably best for beginning mixers to go easy on the 
EQ and stay subtle. But you will need to use some EQ, and these frequency 
ranges are generally accepted:
	
✓	Low end: 20–250 Hz
	
✓	Lower midrange: 250–1000 Hz
	
✓	Upper midrange: 1–8 kHz
	
✓	High end: 8–20 kHz
	
The biggest challenge for beginning mixers is getting the low end right. Boosting 
anything between 20–60 Hz can easily overpower a mix. The low end workflow 
I’m about to give you has saved my bass from trouble on many occasions. If the 
low end is too thick or unclear, mute things that should be in the low end (kick 
drum, bass guitar, low strings, and so on) and listen for what’s left in the mix. If 
you still hear bass, EQ it out, as you’ll learn later in this chapter. Some big cul­
prits to listen for are acoustic guitar, piano, synths, low percussion, and electric 
guitar.

 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
Depth
Another dimension you can add to your mix is depth, near and far. The dif­
ference between balance and depth is that while a lead vocal can be up front 
in the mix (balance) it can include an element of depth through the use of 
reverb or echo, making it also seem far away. If you want sounds to be inti­
mate, leave them dry (without effects). If you want sounds to seem larger 
than life, add depth.
Your main tools for creating depth in the mix are reverb and delay. Reverb 
is an effect that simulates the reflections of sound bouncing in an enclosed 
space. Delay is an effect that takes the original signal and delays it before 
playing it back again. Sometimes, delay is used in place of reverb because 
it gives the impression of space without taking up as much space as reverb. 
Both effects are commonly used together in a mix.
	
The brain can perceive approximately two or three levels of depth at a time. 
That means you need only a couple of reverbs or delays in your mix.
Effects
Playing with effects is a lot of fun. Just ask a guitar player to use only one 
effects pedal, and you’ll get a look that wonders why you’re such a buzz kill. 
Effects add character to your sound and help instruments create their own 
sonic space. You’ll consistently use the following three major families of 
effects in your mixing:
	
✓	Modulation effects: Chorus uses multiple delays for thickness and rich­
ness. Phasers use a narrow-band EQ cut that’s swept back and forth 
through the frequency spectrum. Flangers create washy phase cancel­
lations throughout the frequency spectrum. Tremolo and vibrato vary 
volume and pitch, respectively.
	
✓	Distortion: Distortion effects include tube distortion, tape distortion, dis­
tortion effect pedals, hard clipping, soft clipping, transformer clipping, 
noise, record pops and scratches, and speaker distortion.
	
✓	Filters: Filtering effects include band-pass filters, filter sweeps, envelope 
filters, and wah wahs.
Dynamics
How would you like it if everyone yelled at you all the time? Or what if they 
constantly whispered? We need contrast to feel the effect of loudness and soft­
ness. Dynamics are integral to keeping your listener interested and engaged.
                           

280
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Changes in volume are the key to dynamics. Here are three ways you can pro­
vide dynamics in your mix:
	
✓	Peaks and valleys: Your overall mix should have changes in volume. 
Some genres of music, such as classical and jazz, tolerate more dynamics 
than others, such as pop or rock. Popular music is often listened to in 
settings where the need for dynamics is lower, such as in the background 
of clubs and parties, while classical and jazz are listened to in more inti­
mate settings where music is the focus. At the very least, identify the cli­
maxes of the music, and design those areas to be the loudest part of your 
mix, regardless of the genre.
	
✓	Compression: Compressor effects are used for effect or to control the 
dynamics of instruments, groups of instruments, or the entire mix. You 
discover many types of dynamic control later in this chapter.
	
✓	Envelopes: You find out about ADSR envelopes (attack, decay, sustain, 
and release) in Chapter 11. Envelopes, like compressors, control the 
dynamics of individual sounds. They’re useful at bringing out dynamics 
at a micro level. Synths and samplers have built-in envelopes, but you 
can also add envelope effects to other instruments, as you learn later in 
this chapter in the “Using other dynamics tools” section.
Interest
The final mixing fundamental is interest. All these fundamentals work together, 
but you could define a workflow around the order in which I’ve presented 
them. Set your mindset before you do anything. Set up your acoustics before 
you set your balances, and so on. Some fundamentals blend together more 
than the others. For example, adjusting your panning helps to set your bal­
ances, and your effects and dynamics help your mix sound interesting.
I leave this discussion with three final elements to elevate your mix into 
something that sounds interesting and keeps your listener’s attention:
	
✓	Focus: Find the main point of interest and focus on it. It could be a lead 
vocal, a solo, or a riff. Give the listener something interesting to focus on 
at all times.
	
✓	Uniqueness: Find a unique element and make it stand out. If you can’t 
find a unique element, find a way to make an ordinary element sound 
unique.
	
✓	Automation: Use automation to add dynamics, mutes, panning, and 
effects, all which lead to creating interest. You learn about automation in 
Chapter 17.

 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
Knowing Your Channel Strip Types
You use channel strips to shape your sound and control the signal flow. You 
have control over the volume, pan, effects, and where the sound is coming 
from and where it’s going. Similar to track types, which you learn about in 
Chapter 4, different channel strips do different things. Some channel strip 
types are automatically added to your project while others you can add for 
specific purposes.
In this section, you learn about the five different channel strips, which are 
shown in Figure 16-3, and what they do.

Show Advanced Tools must be selected in the Advanced Preferences pane to 
take full advantage of the mixer and all the information in this chapter. Choose 
Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Advanced Tools, and then select Show Advanced 
Tools.
Audio channel strips
You use audio channel strips (refer to Figure 16-3) for audio tracks. When you 
create an audio track, an audio channel strip is automatically added to the 
mixer in your project. Everything you record live, such as guitars or vocals, 
uses an audio channel strip. Imported and bounced audio also use an audio 
channel strip.
Instrument channel strips
Software instrument tracks use instrument channel strips (refer to Figure 16-3). 
Instrument channel strips are similar to audio channel strips except that they 
use MIDI as the source material instead of audio. Instrument channel strips 
also allow you to add MIDI effects, which you learn about in the “Adding 
Effects to Tracks” section.
MIDI channel strips
MIDI channel strips (refer to Figure 16-3) are used to control your external 
MIDI gear. You can’t add audio or MIDI effects to these channel strips, and 
you can’t route audio or save channel strip settings. You can, however, con­
trol track automation, mute the track, and send general MIDI settings to the 
connected instrument, such as volume, pan, and other controller data.
Auxiliary channel strips
Auxiliary channel strips (labeled in Figure 16-3) are used mainly for routing 
the audio of other track types. You can use auxiliary channel strips as sub­
mixes and add effects as a whole. For example, all the tracks in a summing 
track stack (described in Chapter 4) send their audio outputs to a collective 
auxiliary channel strip. You can also send a portion of a track’s signal to an 
auxiliary channel strip via an effects send to blend reverbs, delays, or other 
effects with the track’s signal.
                           

283
 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
Output channel strips
All audio is routed through a default output channel strip (refer to the right­
most strip in Figure 16-3) before it goes to your master output. You can add 
effects to the output channel strip that will affect the entire mix, such as 
dynamics compression and EQ. If your hardware supports it, you can add 
additional outputs and assign tracks or submixes to them for outboard pro­
cessing or additional monitor mixes.
	
The inspector has two channel strips, as shown in Figure 16-4. The channel 
strip on the left shows the selected track’s channel strip. The channel strip 
on the right is dynamic and, by default, shows the output of the channel strip 
on the left. If the selected track has a send effect, you can click the send slot 
and the second channel strip is updated to show the auxiliary channel strip 
being used to host the send effects. This feature is useful if you’re mixing a track 
and you also want to adjust the sound of the send effects it’s using.

Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Using Meters to Visualize 
Volume and Levels
Loudness. We’re kidding ourselves that we can perceive it objectively. Music 
often sounds instantly better when it gets louder. But you can only turn it 
up so much before you see diminishing returns (or blow up your speakers). 
If you don’t stage your volume levels with the big picture in mind, you can 
easily run into a situation where you’re constantly seeing red lights at the top 
of your meters and pulling down faders and readjusting the balance of your 
mix. In this section, you discover how to use your meters so you don’t trick 
yourself into thinking that louder is better.
	
If you calibrate your monitoring level as I described previously, in the 
“Frequency” section, you’ll have a much easier time perceiving loudness 
and you won’t need to rely on your meters to tell you how loud the music is.
Your ears are the number-one meter of quality. A little bit of ear training can 
go a long way in polishing your perception of sound. A close second to your 
ears are the meters on your channel strips. I’d like to give you one rule for 
setting the levels on your meters: Peak no higher than between –12 and –6 
dBFS on your output channel strip. All the tracks that sum together will 
need to be even lower, probably between –18 and –12 dBFS. You will have 
plenty of opportunity to get your overall mix louder as you go through the 
mastering process in Chapter 18.
	
I have an hour-long video about ear training with Logic Pro X that I am 
happy to share with you. Just visit http://logicstudiotraining.com/
lpxfordummies.
Understanding clipping
The meters in Logic Pro are measured in dBFS, which stands for decibel 
full scale. 0 dBFS is the top limit and anything above that is digital clipping. 
Digital clipping means that the signal has gone beyond maximum capacity. 
The result is distortion in the audio, and not the good kind of distortion that 
rock guitar players know and love. Digital distortion is an unpleasant sound 
that you should avoid.
When digital audio came along, 16 bits was the maximum resolution. 16-bit 
audio accounted for about 96 dB of recordable space, and it was deemed 
important to record and mix as close to 0 dBFS as possible to keep noise low 
and use the full digital resolution. Logic Pro is capable of 24-bit recording, so 
you can record better signals at much lower levels and regain the headroom 
                           

285
 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
that was a major benefit of analog mixes. In fact, you’d have to lower your 
mix by 48 dB to equal a 16-bit recording.
Lowering your mixing levels gives you more headroom and makes mixing 
easier because you’re not always fighting red lights (digital clipping) and 
having to readjust your balances. Lower mixing levels also makes it easier to 
work with third-party effects plug-ins or outboard analog gear and to raise 
the final level at the mastering stage.
Choosing pre-fader or post-fader metering
Audio professionals have a common complaint with Logic Pro’s meters: They 
default to post-fader. In post-fader metering, the position of the fader affects 
the level of the meters. With post-fader metering enabled, the meters will show 
no level if your channel strip fader is all the way down. Post-fader metering 
offers visual assistance when you’re using a “mix with your eyes” approach. 
You can see the track level with your eyes on the meter based on the location 
of your fader. That’s not a bad thing, but it’s definitely not the whole picture.
Switching to pre-fader metering shows you the level of the signal regardless 
of the fader’s location. Pre-fader metering allows you to see whether a track 
is clipping, even when your fader has pulled the level all the way down. You’d 
be surprised how many software instrument presets clip right from the start. 
You need to know exactly what signal level is hitting the channel so you can 
make the appropriate decisions when it comes to adding effects such as com­
pression or EQ.
On analog mixing consoles, many engineers will set the faders to unity gain 
(the default position) and quickly get track levels stable by using a trim 
control. You can do something similar by putting Logic Pro’s Gain plug-in in 
the first insert effects slot, setting the basic rough level with the plug-in, and 
using the channel strip fader to fine-tune the level. You probably won’t need 
to add the Gain plug-in to every track, but it can help if a recorded track is 
too loud. You learn how to add insert effects later, in the “Adding audio and 
MIDI insert effects” section.
Another complaint is that peak level meters, the type Logic Pro and most 
digital audio workstations use, have almost nothing to do with loudness. For 
example, two takes from a drummer can sound equally as loud, but one take 
can peak 4–10 dB higher on a single snare hit. If you raise the other take so 
that they both peak at the same level, one will sound much louder, maybe 
even twice as loud. To judge loudness, the ear responds to average levels and 
not peak levels. Peak meters are great when you need to be concerned with 
clipping (well, you’re always concerned with that), but they don’t help you 
perceive loudness very well. For that reason, professionals often work with 
VU (volume units) meters, which more closely respond like an ear.
                           

286
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Logic Pro doesn’t come with VU metering, so learning to use pre-fader meter­
ing will help. Consider searching for a free VU meter plug-in or purchasing 
one. You can mix without VU meters, but the job is easier with them. To 
switch to pre-fader metering, follow these steps:
	
1.	Control-click an empty area of the control bar, and then choose 
Customize Control Bar and Display.
	
	 The customization dialog opens.
	
2.	In the Modes and Functions column, select Pre Fader Metering.
	
3.	Click OK.
	
	
	 The pre-fader metering icon (shown in the margin) is added to the con­
trol bar.
	
4.	Click the pre-fader metering icon to turn it on.
	
If you want to quickly switch between pre-fader and post-fader metering, set 
the Toggle Pre-Fader Metering key command. For details, see Chapter 3.
Changing the level-meter scale
Take a look at your level meters, shown in Figure 16-5. The lower they are, 
the coarser they are. They go from increments of 1 dB at the top to 10 dB 
at the bottom. Trying to make subtle changes when your fader is near the 
bottom becomes more difficult than it needs to be. You can adjust the scale 
of your level meters to suit your needs.

Follow these steps to change the scale of your channel strip level meters:
	
1.	Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Display.
	
	 The Display Preferences window opens.
	
2.	Click the Mixer tab.
	
3.	On the Scale drop-down menu, choose one of the following:
 
• Exponential: This scale has a higher resolution in the upper range 
of the meter. Use this scale if you want finer control at the top of 
the meter.
 
• Section dB-linear: This scale has a near-even resolution through­
out the meter. Use this scale if you want an even control over the 
entire level. 
	
If you think you might want to change the level-meter scale frequency, you can 
assign a Toggle Level Meter Scale key command. For details on creating key 
commands, see Chapter 3.
Adjusting Channel Strip Controls
The channel strip is where you adjust the volume and sound of a track. You 
can view a selected track’s channel strips in the following ways:
	
✓	Choose View➪Show Inspector or press I. The channel strip is shown on 
the inspector. You may have to close the region and track inspector to 
view all channel strip controls.
	
✓	Choose View➪Show Mixer or press X. The selected channel strip appears 
light gray in the mixer. You may need to adjust the size of the mixer to 
view all channel strip controls.
	
✓	Choose Window➪Open Mixer or press ⌘-2 to open the mixer in a new 
window.
You can adjust multiple selected channel strips simultaneously. To select 
multiple channel strips, Shift-click the channel strips or make a choice on the 
Edit➪Select menu in the mixer. You can select multiple tracks in the mixer 
also by dragging along the channel strip names of the channel strips you 
want to select.
	
By default, not all channel strip controls are shown. To show or hide chan­
nel strip components, Control-click any track in the mixer or inspector and 
choose the components you want to show on the Channel Strip Components 
menu. You can also show and hide channel strip components by using the 
View menu in the mixer.
                           

288
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Adjusting volume and toggling 
between levels
Adjust the volume of your tracks by raising or lowering the fader on each 
channel strip. The default fader state (no boost or cut) is called unity gain. 
You can quickly restore your fader to unity gain by Option-clicking the 
­channel strip.
	
Your faders are capable of .01 dB changes. Don’t drive yourself crazy with 
these tiny increments. At least 1 dB of change is required before you reach a 
just noticeable difference, so moving your fader less than 1 dB isn’t worth the 
effort. Depending on the frequency and complexity of a sound, even a 3 dB 
change in level is barely noticeable. Save time by moving your faders in incre­
ments of 1 dB or more.
Adjusting the pan balance
The pan balance knob is located above the fader and dB readout. Rotate the 
knob to find the ideal position in the stereo spectrum and Control-click it to 
reset it to center. Use pan to balance tracks from left to right and to find clar­
ity on individual instruments. You can achieve balance by positioning tracks 
evenly throughout the stereo field. If the arrangement is balanced, it can 
dictate the panning. For example, a call and response between two groups of 
instruments can be panned on opposite sides of the stereo spectrum.
	
Your three most sacred positions are center, hard left, and hard right. Vocals, 
bass, kick drum, and snare are almost always panned center. What you put in 
the left and right positions will depend on the mixing concept, as described 
previously in the “Understanding Important Mixing Concepts” section. If two 
guitar tracks are playing at the same time, they are often panned hard left and 
hard right with other instruments filling in between.
Muting and soloing tracks
At the bottom of the channel strips are two buttons labeled M (mute) and S 
(solo). Mute a track to disable it from the mix. Solo a track, and all the other 
tracks’ mute buttons blink to indicate they are muted. Sometimes, you can’t 
find a track that was originally soloed because it’s hidden or among many 
other tracks. In that case, press Control-Option-⌘-S to engage the Solo Off for 
All key command. You can also Option-click a solo button to unsolo all the 
other tracks.
                           

289
 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
	
You can put a track into solo-safe mode so it won’t mute even if you solo 
another track. Control-click the solo button of a track to toggle solo-safe mode. 
A red slash will cross the solo button. Solo-safe mode is useful when you want 
to hear more than one track at a time when you use solo mode.
Grouping tracks
After you get the balance of a group of instruments, such as drums, just right, 
you can adjust their volumes together as a group. Good candidates for chan­
nel groups are drums, background vocals, doubled lead vocals, and anything 
that goes together and should be adjusted together. To group tracks and 
choose group settings, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the channel strip’s Group slot and choose Open Group Settings, 
or press Shift-Option-G.
	
	 The Group Inspector opens, as shown in Figure 16-6.

2.	Select the Groups Active check box.
	
	 When you want to edit a track individually, deselect the Groups Active 
check box.
	
3.	Select the track group check box in the list.
	
	 A track can be in more than one group at a time. You can also rename 
the group by double-clicking in the name field and entering the new 
group name.
	
4.	Select the track settings you want to adjust as a group.
	
	 If you don’t see the group settings, click the Settings disclosure triangle.
Note that you can also edit tracks as a group by selecting the Editing (selec­
tion) check box. This option is useful when you want to edit drum tracks or 
background vocal tracks as a group. If the grouped tracks are audio tracks 
and were recorded together, such as drum tracks, select the Phase-Locked 
Audio check box to ensure that your edits don’t adjust the phase of the 
tracks, which can produce unwanted cancellations of frequencies between 
the tracks.
	
After you add a track to a group, the group inspector pane is added to the 
inspector between the region and track inspectors. From the group inspector, 
you can quickly deselect the Groups Active check box to allow individual track 
adjustments or make other group adjustments without opening the group 
inspector window.
Choosing input and output settings
The input and output settings you have available are determined in part by 
your hardware. During the mixing of your project, you rarely need to change 
input settings because you’re not recording audio sources. You might want to 
change your output settings, however. In particular, you can do some creative 
audio routing by choosing a bus as an output.
Buses are used to route audio to and from auxiliary tracks. To route the 
output of a track to an auxiliary track, click-hold the output slot and choose a 
bus on the menu. If a bus is already being used to route audio to an auxiliary 
track, it will have the name of the auxiliary track in parenthesis. Because you 
can route many tracks to the same auxiliary track, you can process them as 
a group. You learn more about auxiliary tracks later, in the “Using auxiliary 
channel strips” section.
                           

291
 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
You can route the output of a track to an output other than the main stereo 
output if your audio hardware supports it. You can use your additional out­
puts to route audio to external hardware or additional monitors. You can 
also choose No Output if you don’t want the track to sound at all, or you can 
select the Surround output if your hardware supports it. You can even select 
the Binaural output setting, which allows you to pan the track as if it were 
coming from behind your head. (Wear headphones for this type of panning.)
Selecting channel strip settings
When you set up a channel strip the way you like it, you can save the settings 
for recall. Click the Setting button at the top of the channel strip and choose 
Save Channel Strip Setting As. A dialog opens where you can name and save 
the setting. You can load your saved channel strip settings with the same 
menu as well as copy, paste, and reset the channel strip.
	
You can change channel strip settings by sending MIDI program changes from 
your MIDI controller. Click the Setting button and choose Save as Performance. 
Have your MIDI controller send a program change message to change the 
channel strip setting on the selected track. Only 127 performances can be 
saved. The MIDI program change value is listed next to the performance name 
on the Performance menu.
Adding Effects to Tracks
I don’t know many Logic Pro users who get excited about setting track vol­
umes or panning, but they can’t seem to get enough of plug-ins and effects. 
And for good reason, too, because using effects is where a lot of the fun, 
experimentation, and magic come into the mix. Logic Pro comes with some of 
the most amazing sound effects on the market and includes everything you 
need to make great sounding music.
Adding audio and MIDI insert effects
Audio insert effects can be added to audio, instrument, auxiliary, and output 
channel strips. You add effects plug-ins via the channel strip Audio FX slot. 
Click an empty effects slot and, on the menu that appears, choose the plug-
in you want to add. Insert effects have three clickable areas, as shown in 
Figure 16-7. You open the plug-in interface by clicking the center of the plug-in 
slot. You can choose a different plug-in by clicking the right side of the plug-in 
to open the plug-in menu. You can turn plug-ins on and off by clicking the left 
side of the plug-in.

Insert effects are added to the channel strip in series, which means that the 
audio signal goes through each effect in the order in which it is inserted. 
You can reorder effects by click-dragging the center of the plug-in to the new 
location. You can also drag plug-ins to other channel strips. You can copy an 
effect by Option-dragging the plug-in to a new location.
MIDI effects, which are new to Logic Pro X, sound and look gorgeous, as 
shown in Figure 16-8. MIDI effects can be added only to instrument channel 
strips. You add MIDI effects plug-ins via the channel strip MIDI FX slot. You can 
replace, move, and copy MIDI effects plug-ins just like audio effects plug-ins.

 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
Adding send effects
While insert effects are serial in the signal flow (one goes through the 
next), send effects are parallel in signal flow (one goes beside the other). 
Send effects are useful when you want to send a portion of the signal 
through an effect, but you want the original sound to remain untouched. 
For example, you can send a portion of a snare or vocal through a reverb 
and mix the reverb with the original sound. Reverbs, delays, and compres­
sors are commonly used as send effects. The auxiliary channel that hosts 
the effects will often have other insert effects on it, such as EQ, compres­
sion, or dynamics.
To add a send effect to a channel strip, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the channel strip send slot, and choose a bus on the menu.
	
	 The send slot routes the signal through a bus to an auxiliary channel 
strip. If the bus is empty, an auxiliary channel strip is created and added 
to the mixer.
	
2.	Drag up or down on the send level knob to change the level sent to 
the auxiliary channel strip.
	
	 You can also double-click the send knob and enter the value directly.
	
3.	Add the insert effects you want to the auxiliary track.
	
	 The effects on the auxiliary track process the signal you route through 
the send.
Similar to insert effects, you can click the left side of the send slot to turn it 
on and off. Click-hold the right side of the slot to choose a different bus and 
the way the fader and pan controls affect the send. Select pre-fader when 
you want the send effect level to remain unchanged as you lower or raise the 
fader of the channel strip. Select post-fader when you want the send effect 
level to remain relative to the fader level. Select post-pan (the default) to 
allow both the fader and the pan knob to determine how the signal is sent to 
the auxiliary channel strip.
Controlling Signal Flow
After your tour of channel strips and insert and send effects, you understand 
that signal flow is flexible in Logic Pro. You can route audio in many ways for 
both practical and creative purposes. In this section, you find more ways to 
control signal flow.

Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Understanding how insert 
and send effects work
As you learned previously, insert effects are inserted in a series. The order 
in which you insert the effects can have a big effect on your sound. However, 
many Logic Pro plug-ins, such as Compressor and Space, have a mix control, 
so you can adjust the level of dry and wet signal, effectively turning it into a 
parallel effect.
Send effects are always parallel to the source that’s sending the signal. But 
on the auxiliary channel that’s hosting the effects, the plug-ins are inserted in 
series. You can also use effects sends on auxiliary channel strips. For example, 
you can add a distortion or overdrive plug-in to an auxiliary track and send a 
small amount of your lead vocal to it so it’s in the background, adding a little 
color. Then you can send the distorted auxiliary track to a delay or reverb so 
that the distorted vocal is adding a bit of depth and interest to your mix.
	
Make your mix as complicated or as simple as you want, but don’t lose sight 
of your mixing goal and concept. What are you trying to do to the audio? Is it 
necessary? Is it enhancing your audio? Experiments are great, but give your­
self a time limit. Otherwise, you’ll easily spend your creative time tweaking 
instead of finishing your project. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to try out 
new ideas on your next project.
Using auxiliary channel strips
You just discovered some ways to use auxiliary channel strips creatively. You 
can also use auxiliary channel as submixes, without any effects, by selecting 
an auxiliary track as the output on a group of tracks. To create submixes. 
follow these steps:
	
1.	Select the tracks you want to group.
	
	 Drum tracks or background vocal tracks are great examples of tracks 
you would group in a submix.
	
2.	Click-hold the output slot on one of the selected tracks and choose an 
empty bus.
	
	 An auxiliary channel strip is added to the mixer, and you can control the 
sound and level of all the tracks as a group from the auxiliary track.
                           

295
 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
Another important use of auxiliary channel strips is for efficient use of effects 
on multiple tracks. There’s no need to create a separate reverb effects send 
on every track that needs reverb, especially because reverbs such as Space 
Designer are processor intensive. Create one reverb effects send and add 
multiple tracks to the same reverb. This technique also gives your mix a 
cohesive sound.
Another popular use of an auxiliary channel strip is for parallel compres­
sion. Create an effects send on the lead vocal or a group of drums. Add the 
Compressor plug-in to the auxiliary channel strip and compress it heavily, as 
described later, in the “Using the Compressor” section. Then mix the com­
pressed sound with the dry sound, and you’ll get more presence and loud­
ness without raising the level of the dry tracks.
	
After you have your effects sends set up the way you like, you can add them to 
a track stack and save them as a patch for later recall. For details, see Chapter 4.
Using multi-output instruments
Multi-output capabilities are built into some Logic Pro software instruments, 
such as Drum Kit Designer, EXS24, and Ultrabeat. Multi-output instruments 
enable you to route audio within the instrument to its own channel strip. This 
gives you individual control over sounds and enables you to route sounds to 
separate outputs. To use a multi-output instrument:
	
1.	Click the right side of the instrument slot on the channel strip, and 
choose the Multi Output option of the instrument on the menu.
	
	 The mixer channel strip is updated with a plus icon and a minus icon 
above the mute icon, as shown in Figure 16-9.
	
2.	Click the plus icon to add instrument outputs to the mixer.
	
	 New channel strips are added to the right of the first instrument channel 
strip. The number of outputs you have available depends on the soft­
ware instrument.
	
3.	Click the center of the instrument slot to open the instrument interface.
	
4.	In the instrument interface, route the sounds to the outputs in the mixer.
	
	 Each instrument handles routing differently. Some instruments, such as 
Drum Kit Designer, have sounds hard-wired to specific outputs. Others, 
such as Ultrabeat, are more flexible and allow you to choose how sounds 
are routed. Consult the instruments’ manual (Help➪Logic Pro Instruments) 
for specific instrument instructions.

Because setting up multi-output instruments can be time consuming, save 
your multi-output instrument setups as patches for later recall. For instruc­
tions on saving patches, see Chapter 4.
Using the output and master 
channel strips
Unless you have a channel strip’s output set to No Output or an additional 
output that doesn’t return into Logic Pro, all channel strips are summed to 
your stereo output channel strip and finally to your master output. Here’s a 
description of your output and master channel strips:
	
✓	Output: Your stereo output behaves similarly to other channel strips, 
except you can’t add send effects to it. You can use this channel strip to 
adjust the final level of your mix, as described in Chapter 18. The output 
channel strip has a bounce icon below the meter to export your project 
to a single file or burn it to CD or DVD. For details on bouncing your 
project, see Chapter 19.
	
✓	Master: Your master output is stripped to the basics. Many professionals 
never touch the master fader during a project and instead use the output 
for overall volume control. You can adjust the fader level and even automate 
the fader, as described in Chapter 17. In addition to the mute icon, you have 
a dim icon, which allows you to adjust the playback volume according to 
the dim level. To set the dim level, choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Audio, 
click the General tab, and adjust the Dim Level slider.

 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
Adjusting the EQ of Your Tracks
EQs (equalizers) are used to adjust the frequencies of your tracks. You might 
need to correct audio sources, such as microphones, recording environ­
ments, or instrument sounds. You can use EQ also to enhance the tone of a 
track and make it fit in the context of the entire mix. Several types of EQs are 
available, such as graphic EQ, parametric EQ, and low- or high-shelf EQ. In 
this section, you will learn how to use EQ to adjust the sound of your mix.
	
There’s no right way to EQ your tracks. Different genres of music handle fre­
quencies differently, and a wide range of acceptable EQ exists even within a 
genre. Because there’s no perfect amount of bass or treble, if it sounds good to 
you and your listeners, it’s good.
Adding Channel EQ
Logic Pro Channel EQ is a plug-in that also has a special place on the channel 
strip to display the EQ curve and quickly access the EQ controls. You can add 
the Channel EQ plug-in to a track in the following ways:
	
✓	Double-click the EQ display on the channel strip. The Channel EQ plug-in 
is added to the first available insert effects slot, and the plug-in interface 
opens, as shown in Figure 16-10.
	
✓	Choose EQ➪Channel EQ from the channel strips effects slot, just as you 
would add any other insert effect.
	
Figure 16-10: 
The Channel 
EQ plug-in.
	
                           

298
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Channel EQ is capable of adjusting eight frequency bands simultaneously. 
You can turn any of the bands on or off by clicking the colored buttons at the 
top of the interface. Bands 1 and 8 are low-pass and high-pass filters, respec­
tively. Bands 2 and 7 are low-shelving and high-shelving filters, respectively. 
Bands 3 through 6 are parametric bell filters. You can adjust the boost or cut 
of each band by dragging the frequency handle in the graphic display, drag­
ging the values of the fields below the graphic display, or double-clicking the 
fields and entering the value directly. Here’s a description of the values:
	
✓	Frequency: The top value adjusts the center frequency of the band.
	
✓	Gain/Slope: The center value adjusts the level of boost or cut of the fre­
quency band. In the case of the low-pass and high-pass filters, the value 
adjusts the slope of the filter.
	
✓	Q factor: The bottom value adjusts the frequency range that’s affected, 
known as resonance or Q factor. Higher values lead to narrower fre­
quency ranges.
You can adjust the gain of the entire track with the Gain slider on the right 
side of the interface. Click the Analyzer button below the frequency display 
to turn the Channel EQ analyzer on or off. Inside the Analyzer button is a 
Pre/Post button that toggles the analyzer display of the frequency curve 
before and after the EQ. This feature is useful when you want to see both the 
frequency content of the track (pre) and how the EQ is affecting the track 
(post). The Q-Couple button connects the frequency gain with the Q factor 
so that the resonance band narrows as you increase the boost or cut of the 
frequency.
Using match EQ
Logic Pro comes with several EQ plug-ins, and one of the more magical EQs 
is Match EQ, shown in Figure 16-11. It allows you to grab the frequency spec­
trum of one audio track and apply it to another. You can use it on individual 
tracks, groups of tracks, or even your stereo output. It can’t take a folk song 
and make it sound like a heavy metal song, but it has many practical uses, 
especially for beginners.
To match the EQ of one track to another, follow these steps:
	
1.	Add the Match EQ plug-in on the track to which the EQ is to be applied.
	
	 The track with the Match EQ plug-in is the track that will be modified by 
the frequency curve of a different track.
	
2.	On the Side Chain menu in the plug-in header, select the track to use 
as a template.
                           

299
 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
	
Figure 16-11: 
The 
match EQ.
	
	
3.	Click the Template Learn icon at the bottom of the plug-in interface.
	
	 Learn mode turns on so you can create a template from the track selected 
on the Side Chain menu.
	
4.	Play the project until the frequency curve stabilizes in the graphic 
display.
	
5.	Click the Template Learn icon to turn off learn mode.
	
6.	Click the Material Match icon.
	
	 The new match EQ curve is added to the graphic display and applied to 
the current track.
You can adjust the frequency curve by dragging the curve in the graphic dis­
play. You can also adjust how much of the curve is applied to the track with 
the Apply slider on the right side of the interface. Drag the Smoothing slider 
to smooth the filter curve. Here are a couple more uses for Match EQ:
	
✓	Match the EQ of vocals recorded on a different day: The voice is a 
dynamic instrument and often changes from day to day, causing issues if 
you track a vocal on different days. You can use Match EQ to remove the 
differences and create a consistent vocal sound.
                           

300
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
	
✓	Reverse-match conflicting tracks: If you have a track that’s conflicting 
with another, drag the Apply slider to a negative value, which will invert 
the frequency curve and remove the conflicting frequencies. This trick is 
especially useful on bass guitar and kick drum, which frequently fight for 
space in the low end.
Adding Depth with Reverb and Delay
You accomplish the illusion of depth in your mix through the use of reverb 
and delay. Reverbs are designed to simulate acoustic spaces. Aside from 
using actual acoustic spaces, many different techniques have been used to 
create reverb effects. Logic Pro can re-create them all.
Mechanical and digital reverbs have distinct sounds and have become classic 
studio accessories. Plates and spring reverbs are classic mechanical reverbs. 
A plate reverb is a metal plate that vibrates when audio signals are sent into 
it. A pickup on the plate records the signal to get a shimmery reverb. Spring 
reverbs are common in guitar amps and have a spring that bounces and 
gets picked up and mixed into the output. An impulse response is a digital 
algorithm that’s created by sending a sound into the space, recording what 
comes back, and analyzing the difference to replicate it. Impulse responses 
are realistic and more adjustable than an acoustic space.
	
If you want an intimate sound, it should be dry and up close, with less chance 
to bounce around. But if it’s a huge sound you want, you might want it to 
bounce through an arena or echo across mountaintops.
Delays are reproductions of the original signal that are delayed. A tape delay 
uses actual electromagnetic tape to record the signal and play it back, which 
adds its own character. Digital delays provide exact copies of the original 
sound. The delayed signal can also be altered with filters or other processing 
to add interest.
You can use short delays to create a double-tracking effect, as if you had 
recorded the signal twice. Delays set to around 50 milliseconds can also simulate 
a small space. Sometimes, delays are preferable to reverbs for simulating acous­
tic spaces because they take up less room in the mix. You can get the famous 
slapback echo of Elvis and others with delays between 65 and 150 milliseconds. 
You can also tempo match multiple delays (multitap) at different parts of the 
beat for interesting rhythmic effects.
                           

301
 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
	
The Haas effect, also known as the precedence effect, is a binaural psycho­
acoustic effect that makes your audio signal sound as if it’s coming from out­
side the speakers. Add a 30-millisecond delay panned opposite to the original 
signal for ultra-wide stereo signals. This technique is useful when you’re run­
ning out of room in the stereo spectrum of your mix.
Using Space Designer
The Space Designer plug-in, shown in Figure 16-12, is a convolution reverb. 
It convolves, or combines, the audio signal with an impulse response to 
simulate acoustic environments. Space Designer can create any space, such 
as inside a cabinet, a plastic or cardboard box, or an opera house. Space 
Designer also has a synthetic impulse response to create unique effects.
Figure 16-12: 
Space 
Designer.
Space Designer is most often used on auxiliary tracks and used as an effects 
send because it is processor intensive. That way, you can send several instru­
ment tracks to the same Space Designer plug-in on the auxiliary track.
                           

302
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Space Designer comes with many presets that you can access on the preset 
menu at the top of the plug-in. You can adjust the presets within the plug-in 
interface. Here’s a description of the Space Designer interface:
	
✓	Impulse response parameters: The round area on the left side of the 
interface is where you adjust the impulse response parameters. Click 
the IR Sample button or Synthesized IR button to switch between the 
impulse response samples and synthesized impulse response. Drag the 
Sample Rate slider to adjust the sample rate. Drag or enter a value in 
the Length field to determine the length of the impulse response. The 
Preserve Length button locks the length as you change the sample rate.
	
✓	Main display with button bar: The center display and button bar is 
where you edit the envelope or EQ curve. You change the view mode of 
the main display in the button bar at the top of the display.
	
✓	Envelope and EQ parameters: You can edit the envelope and EQ in the 
main display or numerically in the parameter bar below the display. The 
parameters you can adjust depend on the view mode of the main display.
	
✓	Global parameters: On the right side of the interface is the output sec­
tion. Drag the slider to adjust the output levels. The input slider to the 
left of the impulse response parameters sets how to process stereo or 
surround signals. Below the main display are two buttons that turn on 
or off the latency compensation and reverb volume compensation fea­
tures. The knobs at the bottom right of the interface adjust the reverb 
pre-delay and start point of all impulse response types, and the stereo 
spread and crossover frequency of the synthesized impulse responses.
	
✓	Filter parameters: The knobs at the bottom left of the interface adjust 
the filter type and resonance.
	
Use less reverb, if at all, on tracks with a lot of low end, such as bass guitar 
and kick drum tracks. Adding a lot of low end to your reverb can muddy 
your mix and leave less room for the instruments themselves. Stick to using 
reverb on instruments that benefit from depth, such as vocals and snare. Not 
every track in your mix needs to have reverb. And because your listeners can 
perceive only two or three levels of depth at a time, you can create distinct 
groups of depth: close (dry), near (a little reverb), and far (the most reverb).
Using Delay Designer
Delay Designer, shown in Figure 16-13, is a multitap delay that can have up 
to 26 individual taps (delays). Each tap can have a distinct sound, such as 
changes in the volume level, pan, filter, and even the pitch of the delay. It’s 
the most advanced delay that comes installed in Logic Pro X.

If you need a simple delay, try one of the many other delays in Logic Pro, such 
as the Stereo Delay or Tape Delay, which are simple to use and sound great. 
Delay Designer is a processor-intensive delay and unnecessary for most basic 
delay needs.
Delay Designer comes with presets that include everything from basic to 
warped delays. The presets are great starting places for designing your own 
delays. Here’s a description of the Delay Designer interface:
	
✓	Sync section and tap pads: On the left side of the interface, you can 
create taps in real time with the tap pads. Click the Start button to begin. 
The Start button changes to the Tap button, which you click every time 
you want to record a tap. Click the Last Tap button to end. Click the 
Sync button to sync Delay Designer to the project tempo. Adjust the 
sync settings with the Grid resolution and Swing fields.
	
✓	Main display: In middle of the interface is the main display, where you 
adjust the taps. Click the view mode buttons at the top of the display to 
change the displayed parameters. Click the toggle buttons at the top of 
each tap to turn tap parameters on or off. Each tap has a bright bar or 
dot that you can drag to change the level of the selected parameter. At 
the bottom of each tap is an identification letter that you can drag back 
and forth through time. You can copy taps by Option-dragging them.
                           

304
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
	
✓	Master section: On the right side of the interface is the master section. 
The Feedback field sends the output of a single tap back through the 
effects to make the rhythm continuous. The Mix sliders set the wet/dry 
mix so you can use the effect as an insert effect as well as a send effect 
and still control the balance of the wet/dry signal.
	
✓	Tap parameters: The wide bar at the bottom of the interface controls 
the selected tap. You can turn the filter on or off, and set the frequency 
cutoff, resonance, and filter slope. To the right of the Tap Delay circle, 
you can turn the Pitch parameter on or off and set the transpose level. 
The Flip parameter sets the pan to its opposite. You can also set the 
stereo spread, mute, and output level for the selected tap.
	
Get the classic delay made famous by The Edge of U2 by using a dotted eighth-
note delay. An eighth-note or a quarter-note delay can get lost behind all the 
other instruments playing on the beat, but a dotted eight note allows the delay 
to peek out in the space between the other instruments.
Adding or Removing Dynamics 
with Compression
Controlling the dynamics of the overall mix as well as individual instruments 
is a crucial fundamental of mixing. A compressor is your main tool for con­
trolling dynamics as well as for effect. Compressors work well on individual 
sounds, groups of instruments or sounds, and even the entire mix. There are 
many types of dynamic control, include limiting, multiband compression, de-
essing, gating, envelope shaping, side chaining, and parallel compression. In 
this section, you learn how to use the dynamics tools of Logic Pro to create 
powerful and interesting mixes.
Using Compressor
The Logic Pro Compressor plug-in, shown in Figure 16-14, can emulate a wide 
variety of hardware compressors. Many compressors have become classics 
in the recording and mixing world, and there’s a giant market for software 
emulations of these compressors. Logic Pro doesn’t advertise its own com­
pressor emulations, but savvy users know what they are, and you will too 
after you read this section.

Figure 16-14: 
The 
Compressor 
plug-in.
	
Like Channel EQ, Compressor has its own meter in the channel strip, right 
below the EQ display. The meter shows you the amount of gain reduction. 
You can double-click the meter to open Compressor. If it’s not currently 
inserted on the channel strip, it’s added to an open slot. Here’s a description 
of Compressor parameters:
	
✓	Circuit Type: The Circuit Type menu is where you choose a compressor 
emulation:
 
• Platinum: This compressor is Logic Pro’s original compressor. 
It’s a transparent compressor you can use on any audio source to 
­control dynamics.
 
• Studio VCA: The studio VCA is similar to the SSL bus compressor. 
This compressor is clean, with low distortion, and has a faster 
attack than FETs. Use it when you want to protect a track from clip­
ping and on instruments with complex harmonics, such as pianos, 
harpsichords, or 12-string guitars. The studio VCA is great for pro­
viding “glue” on groups of tracks or the entire mix.
 
• Studio FET: The studio FET is new to Logic Pro X. FET-style com­
pression is warm with a fast attack time. It’s often used on indi­
vidual tracks and groups of tracks for both compression and color.
 
• Vintage VCA: The vintage VCA is similar to a dbx 160. This com­
pressor has a fast response and a distinct sound, and is useful for 
protecting tracks from clipping. It’s often used on bass, kick, and 
snare.
                           

306
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
 
• Vintage FET: The vintage FET is similar to the UREI 1176. This com­
pressor can provide a lot of aggressive color to groups of instru­
ments, such as drums, and individual instruments, such as bass 
and lead vocals.
 
• Vintage opto: The vintage opto is similar to a Teletronix LA-2A. 
Electro-optical tube compression is smooth and rich, with a warm 
tone. It’s often used on piano, bass, and vocals.
	
✓	Compressor Threshold: Drag the Compressor Threshold slider to adjust 
the level at which compression starts.
	
✓	Attack: The Attack time knob sets the reaction speed of the compressor.
	
✓	Release: The Release time knob sets the speed it takes for the compres­
sor to release after the signal falls below the threshold. Click the Auto 
button to let the compressor choose the release time.
	
✓	Ratio: The Ratio slider sets the ratio of gain reduction when the thresh­
old is reached.
	
✓	Knee: The Knee slider adjusts how extreme the compression begins 
as the signal reaches the threshold. Low values compress harder, and 
higher values compress softer.
	
✓	Gain: Use the Fain slider to raise or lower the gain after the signal has 
been compressed. You can choose to automatically raise the gain to –12 dB 
or 0 dB on the Auto Gain menu.
	
✓	Limiter Threshold and button: Click the Limiter button to turn the lim­
iter on, which limits the signal from going beyond the level set by the 
limiter threshold.
	
✓	Extended Parameters: Click the disclosure triangle at the bottom of the 
Compressor interface to choose advanced settings. You can choose the 
type of output distortion, which adds color to the compressor in varying 
degrees. You can adjust the output mix to blend the compressed signal 
with the original signal for parallel compression. You can also add a side-
chain filter.
	
You can set Compressor to react to the dynamics in another track in the proj­
ect. Choose the track that will trigger Compressor on the Side Chain menu at 
the top of the plug-in interface. Now Compressor will compress the audio only 
when the track chosen on the Side Chain menu reaches the threshold. This 
feature is useful when you want to make room for a track in the mix by auto­
matically lowering any track that’s competing with it.
                           

307
 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
Using Limiter
The Limiter plug-in, shown in Figure 16-15, is used when you need to restrict 
the level from going any higher. Limiters differ from compressors in that they 
have a strict threshold, whereas compressors only reduce the level above 
the threshold. You might put a limiter on a single track to guarantee that it 
doesn’t clip or on a group of tracks to raise the volume as high as possible 
before it distorts. Limiters can have a big effect on the sound, so a little goes 
a long way.
	
Figure 16-15: 
The Limiter 
plug-in.
	
Limiters are often added as the last insert effect in the chain. But sometimes 
you can add a limiter before a compressor that’s set to a slow attack time to 
catch any large peaks and avoid the pumping and breathing effect that can 
come from too much compression. A description of the Limiter parameters 
follows:
	
✓	Gain: Drag the Gain slider to adjust the level of the input.
	
✓	Lookahead: Drag the Lookahead slider to adjust how far in advance the 
limiter will analyze the signal. Higher levels cause latency, so it’s best 
not to use this setting on instrument or group tracks because it will 
change the timing. Higher lookahead times work better when the Limiter 
is on the main output.
	
✓	Release: Drag the release slider to set the time it takes for the compres­
sor to release after the signal falls below the threshold. Click the Auto 
button to let the compressor choose the release time.

✓	Output Level: Rotate the output level knob to adjust the overall output 
level.
	
✓	Softknee: Click the Softknee button to soften the compression curve as 
the signal reaches the threshold.
Using other dynamics tools
Logic Pro comes with many dynamics tools that can make your time mixing 
easier. Dynamics tools can help you solve problems and be creative at the 
same time. As a beginner, it’s a good idea to use the presets that come with 
these plug-ins. The preset names are educational, and you’ll often find a 
preset that describes exactly what you want to do. Following are other 
dynamics tools you can use:
	
✓	De-esser: Remove hiss from vocal sibilance. This frequency-dependent 
compressor can lower specific frequency ranges, such as those that 
cluster around sibilant sounds.
	
✓	Expander: Expand the dynamic range. For example, you can use an 
expander to reduce the amount of hi-hat leakage in a snare track by 
expanding the distance between the main snare sound and the back­
ground hi-hat.
	
✓	Noise gate: Lower the level of sounds below the threshold. The noise 
gate enables you to remove unwanted room noise, such as amp hump.
	
✓	Enveloper: Adjust the attack and release of a sound’s transients. An 
enveloper is a tone-shaping tool that works well with instruments having 
sharp transients, such as drums, picked and plucked sounds, and 
pianos.
Taking Track Notes
As you mix your project, you make countless changes to each track and its 
parameters. Mixes can go from stable to unstable quickly, without a clear 
path back to stability. Keeping project and track notes can help you cata­
log your big milestones and store important reference material. Choose 
View➪Show Note Pads or press Option-⌘-P to display the note pad, shown in 
Figure 16-16.

 Chapter 16: Mixing Your Project
	
Figure 16-16: 
Track notes.
	
Project notes are a good place to store information about the song arrange­
ment and overall project direction. Track notes are excellent for EQ settings, 
plug-in settings, and preset names. You can also show track notes at the 
bottom of every channel strip in the mixer. Control-click a channel strip in 
the mixer and choose Channel Strip Components➪Track Notes. The project 
and track notes are great scratch pads.
Adding effects and buses to tracks creates auxiliary tracks in the mixer. You 
can add those auxiliary tracks to the track list in the tracks area for organiza­
tion and track automation. (For details, see Chapter 17.) Select the channel 
strips and choose Options➪Create Tracks for Selected Channel Strips, or 
Control-click the channel strips and choose Create Track (Control-T). The 
selected tracks are added to the tracks area where you can edit them.

Martin, each lending a hand to pull faders up and down without stop­
ping, hoping to get the perfect mix take. That’s how mixing was done before 
mechanical faders brought hardware automation to modern mixing boards.
With software automation, you have even greater and more flexible control 
over your mix. Automation can help you first stabilize your mix and then 
design an exciting mix. In this chapter, you find out how to add interest to 
your mix and automate your own mix blueprint.
	
To get all that you can from this chapter, you must have Show Advanced Tools

Tools and select all the available options.
Turning Your Mix Into a Performance 
with Automation
Every track, channel strip, and plug-in is capable of being automated. 
Automation is best to add after the mix is stable. If you’re still arranging or 
editing your project, having automation on a track can get in the way of your 
workflow because you have more things to focus on as you edit. And if your 
mix isn’t stable, the mixing you do affects the automation as well. For these 
reasons, it’s a good idea to use project and track notes to jot down any auto­
mation ideas you may want to try later.
                           

312
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
After your mix is stable, take a pass through the project, focusing on each 
of the core mixing concepts described in Chapter 16. Automate the levels, 
panning, EQ changes, effects, and dynamics. If you plan your automation this 
way, the final result will be an elevated and interesting mix.
Choosing Your Automation Mode
To automate a track, you need to display the track’s automation in the tracks 
area. Choose Mix➪Show Automation or press A. The track headers will sport 
an automation icon and additional parameters, as shown in Figure 17-1. To 
enable automation for a track, click the automation icon in the track header.
	
Figure 17-1: 
Track auto-
mation in 
the tracks 
area.
	
After you’ve enabled automation on a track, you can choose between the fol­
lowing four automation modes on the menu:
	
✓	Read: Automation is played back but not recorded.
	
✓	Touch: Automation is recorded during playback while the parameter is 
being touched; when the parameter is released, it returns to the previ­
ous value. Touch mode is useful when you’re automating a temporary 
change in the parameter that you want to return to the previous value.
	
✓	Latch: Automation is recorded during playback while the parameter 
is being touched; after the parameter is released, automation stops at 
that last touched value. Latch mode is useful when you’re automating a 
parameter to a new value that you want to keep.
                           

313
 Chapter 17: Automating Your Mix
	
✓	Write: Automation is recorded during playback, and existing automation 
is erased as the playhead passes over it. Write mode is useful when you 
want to simultaneously record and erase automation.
	
You can also turn on automation and select automation mode from the auto­
mation slot in the mixer.
Adding Automation to Your Tracks
After you enable automation, adding it to your track is as simple as clicking 
a location on a region with the pointer tool. A control point is added with the 
current parameter’s value, as shown in Figure 17-2.
	
Figure 17-2: 
Track auto-
mation con-
trol points.
	
The parameter you automate is chosen in the automation parameter drop-
down menu on the track header. You can display multiple lanes of automation 
by clicking the disclosure triangle to the left of the automation parameters. 
You can quickly add an automation point at the playhead position for the 
volume, pan, and sends by choosing Mix➪Create Automation➪Create 1 
Automation Point Each for Volume, Pan, and Sends.
	
If you know that the parameter value you’re automating will return to its origi­
nal value, you’ll save time by creating an automation point at the beginning 
and ending of regions. Choose Mix➪Create Automation➪Create 1 Automation 
Point at Region Borders.
                           

314
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Adjusting automation points
The fastest way to adjust automation points is to select them with the pointer 
tool and drag them up, down, left, or right. You can select multiple points by 
Shift-clicking them. You can delete selected points by pressing Delete.
To create smooth curves between automation points, use the automation 
curve tool. Drag left, right, up, or down on the automation line with the auto­
mation curve tool to create automation curves. You can temporarily switch 
from the pointer tool to the automation curve tool by holding down Shift-
Control while dragging the automation line.
Moving regions with or without automation
You may end up needing to make an edit to a track or to your song arrange­
ment after you’ve started automating your mix. Moving regions with automa­
tion can cause complications if you don’t do it right. That’s why Logic Pro’s 
default state is to ask you whether you really want to move regions that have 
automation. You can change this behavior in the automation system prefer­
ences, shown in Figure 17-3. Choose Logic Pro X➪Preferences➪Automation to 
open the automation preferences, and then choose the default behavior from 
the Move Automation with Regions menu. You can choose the default behav­
ior also on the Mix➪Move Automation with Regions menu.

 Chapter 17: Automating Your Mix
Editing automation with MIDI draw
You can automate MIDI regions in multiple ways. In addition to adding auto­
mation points in the tracks area, you can use MIDI draw to automate MIDI 
controller events. Here’s how to use MIDI draw in the tracks area:
	
1.	Turn off automation in the tracks area by clicking the automation 
icon.
	
	 You can’t simultaneously edit automation data and MIDI draw data.
	
2.	Select a MIDI track, choose View➪MIDI Draw, and then choose a MIDI 
parameter.
	
	 The MIDI draw lane is overlaid on the MIDI region, as shown in Figure 17-4. 
You can edit the automation points by using MIDI draw, as described in 
Chapter 15.
Figure 17-4: 
MIDI draw 
in the tracks 
area.
	
You can also automate MIDI parameters using MIDI draw in all the MIDI edi­
tors, including the score editor.
Recording Live Automation
The most precise way to automate your mix is by inputting automation data 
in the tracks area or by using MIDI draw on MIDI regions, as you learn in this 
chapter. But when automation was created on hardware mixing consoles, the 
automation was performed in real time as the project was playing. Recording 
live automation is an enjoyable experience because you get to perform along 
with your track, and perhaps create some magic along the way. Here’s how to 
record live automation:
                           

316
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
	
1.	Choose an automation mode on the tracks you want to automate.
	
	 You can choose Touch, Latch, or Write, as described in the “Choosing 
Your Automation Mode” section, previously in this chapter.
	
2.	Play your project and adjust the parameters you want to automate.
	
	 Automation data is added to the tracks.
	
3.	When you’ve finished automating, stop the project and set the track’s 
automation mode to Read.
	
If you want to speed up the automation process, you can combine it with 
smart controls. You can use the smart controls to record live automation, and 
you can also automate the smart controls from the tracks area. Because smart 
controls can control more than one parameter at a time, you can build some 
dynamic mixes quickly.

Mastering Your Final Track
In This Chapter
▶	Enhancing the mix with EQ
▶	Controlling dynamics with compression
▶	Reaching competitive loudness with limiting
▶	Using audio references to improve your mix
A

fter a track has been mixed, a mastering stage puts the final polish on 
the track. The level is matched to reference levels, and if needed, EQ 
and dynamics processing is applied. In the case of an album project, the mas­
tering stage can include making global refinements and song sequencing and 
cataloging.
For professional situations, the best practice is to hire someone to master 
your track. Someone with a fresh set of ears and nothing but the best 
equipment can raise the level of your mix and turn it into a golden master. 
Sometimes, just sending a signal through a high-end compressor or EQ can 
improve the sound. Other times, a mastering engineer will need to adjust the 
sound to compensate for a poorly tuned room. If the project warrants it, let 
go and let your work be improved.
However, not all projects need outside mastering. Sometimes it’s not practical 
to pay for a mastering service. You might be under a deadline that forces you 
to do it yourself, or you might want to avoid extra expenses when the project 
budget is low. Logic Pro gives you the tools you need to master your own 
music. You can even be the fresh set of ears that masters someone else’s mix.
In this chapter, you discover how to enhance your mix, boost the volume to 
competitive levels, and support your mastering choices with reference audio.
Fine-Tuning EQ
Ask mastering engineers if they put EQ before or after compression and 
they’ll tell you that it depends, leaving you more confused than before. I 
think it’s safe to say that both alternatives can work just fine. If you’re making 
                           

318
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
only subtle changes, the EQ and compressor shouldn’t affect each other too 
much. If your EQ is inserted before the compressor and you make extreme 
EQ changes, the compressor behavior can be affected. In that case, you might 
want to put the EQ after the compressor. Sometimes, cutting unwanted fre­
quencies before the compressor can help you do a better job of compressing. 
Beginners should put the EQ before the compressor when they master their 
track, and keep the changes subtle.
	
Your mastering effects chain is commonly used on the stereo output channel 
strip. That way, all the audio in your project will be affected by the plug-ins. If 
you’ve imported multiple audio tracks into your project for mastering, as in 
the case of an entire album, you may want separate control over each track’s 
mastering effects chain. In this case, you would put the effects on the indi­
vidual track’s channel strip, not the stereo output. More details are given in 
the “Matching levels to other recorded material” section, later in the chapter.
Using Linear Phase EQ
Linear Phase EQ, shown in Figure 18-1, has the same controls as Channel EQ, 
which is described in Chapter 16. Linear Phase EQ works best in mastering 
situations because it keeps the stereo audio in phase even under extreme 
levels of gain, which requires more processing power. Linear Phase EQ 
doesn’t work well on single tracks because it introduces latency that can 
affect the timing of the signal relative to the other tracks. The higher process­
ing and latency makes this EQ ideal for mastering single stereo tracks.
	
Linear Phase EQ shares settings with Channel EQ. You can switch between the 
two plug-ins and they will retain the current settings.

Phase EQ 
plug-in.

 Chapter 18: Mastering Your Final Track
Matching a reference mix with Match EQ
Match EQ (described in Chapter 16) is a great tool to help you get a specific 
sound. You can manipulate your audio only so far after your mix is com­
pleted, but the mastering phase is a great time to analyze the frequency con­
tent of your mix and compare it to a reference mix. You can even adjust your 
mix to capture more frequencies similar to the reference mix. To analyze a 
reference audio file using Match EQ, follow these steps:
	
1.	Drag the reference audio file onto the Template Learn button.
	
	 The audio is analyzed and a frequency curve is added to the graphic dis­
play, as shown in Figure 18-2.
	
Figure 18-2: 
The Match 
EQ plug-in.
	
	
2.	Drag the current audio file that’s being mastered onto the Current 
Learn button.
	
	 The audio is analyzed, and a frequency curve is added to the graphic 
display.
	
3.	Click the Material Match button to apply a match EQ curve to the 
audio.
	
4.	Drag the Apply slider to adjust the level of the match EQ.
	
Don’t expect miracles with Match EQ. I’ve heard it produce amazing and horri­
ble results. At the very least, the graphic display will enlighten you to the dif­
ference in EQ between the audio you’re mastering and the reference audio.

Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Adding Multiband Compression
Multiband compression allows you to separate frequency bands and com­
press them independently. (For the details on compression, see Chapter 16.) 
Logic Pro comes with a plug-in called Multipressor, shown in Figure 18-3, 
which can compress up to four different frequency bands.
	
Figure 18-3: 
The Multi­
pressor 
plug-in.
	
Multiband compression can produce subtle or extreme results. Your main 
goal is to raise the overall level without negatively affecting the balance of 
the mix. You also want the volume level to match the music in your market­
place. Multipressor has many presets that will help you achieve these goals.
Using Multipressor
You can insert Multipressor on a channel strip by clicking an effects slot 
and choosing Dynamics➪Multipressor. Many of its parameters are similar to 
the Compressor plug-in described in Chapter 16. Here’s a description of the 
parameters that are unique to the Multipressor plug-in:
	
✓	Gain Change: Drag the horizontal bars in the graphic display up or 
down to raise or lower, respectively, the gain of that particular frequency 
band. You can adjust the gain also by using the Gain Make-Up fields. 
You raise the gain after a signal has been compressed because, as you 
reduce the level of the peaks via compression, you can raise the overall 
level to get the signal louder.
                           

321
 Chapter 18: Mastering Your Final Track
	
✓	Crossover: Drag the vertical lines in the graphic display left or right to 
lower or raise, respectively, the crossover frequency. You can also enter 
values directly in the crossover fields. It might be easier to start out with 
fewer bands in the beginning. You can add and remove frequency bands 
by clicking their number button above each level meter.
	
✓	Expand Threshold, Ratio, and Reduction: Multipressor has a built-
in expander, which helps you keep some of the dynamics you may be 
losing due to compression. The gain of the signal below the expander 
threshold is reduced based on the ratio. The expander essentially takes 
the quiet signals and makes them quieter.
	
✓	Band Bypass and Solo: Click the bypass and solo buttons above each 
band’s level meter to hear exactly how the compressor is affecting the 
frequency band. These buttons are excellent ear-training tools. Soloing 
and bypassing bands helps you identify where instruments have the 
most and the least frequency energy.
Avoiding a squashed mix
Dynamic mixes need transients. The crack of a snare and the pluck of a string 
have sharp and fast attacks with fast decays. If you lower the attack and raise 
the decay, you’ve compressed the signal. Compressors have the potential to 
remove all the transients and squash the sound, making it weak and muffled. 
To preserve the transients, aim for subtle compression during mastering.
Turn It Up
It’s easy to get seduced into thinking that louder is better. But there’s clearly 
a limit to the loudness that digital audio can reproduce. So how loud is too 
loud? A trained ear listens for distortion, the loss of transients and dynamics, 
and unfavorable effects to the balance. Just remember that your goal isn’t to 
get your track louder than everyone else’s; it’s to get it within the competitive 
range of your marketplace.
The kind of audio material you’re mastering will dictate your loudness needs. 
A track that’s being delivered and sold on iTunes should match other tracks 
in the genre. A track that’s being delivered to a film or TV music supervisor 
for background purposes can withstand lower levels and less compression 
because its job is to not compete with the foreground audio. In this section, 
you discover how to maximize and match the level to an ideal reference 
source.

Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Using Adaptive Limiter for 
maximum loudness
The last effects plug-in to put in your mastering signal chain is Logic Pro’s 
Adaptive Limiter, shown in Figure 18-4. It can raise the overall level of a song 
and add an analog-sounding saturation to your mix. If your mix is already 
dirty with lots of distorted instruments, you might go easy on adding any 
more distortion. But if your mix is relatively clean, a little bit of distortion can 
excite the mix while smoothing the edges.
	
Figure 18-4: 
The 
Adaptive 
Limiter 
plug-in.
	
Adaptive Limiter is located on the Compressor menu of the effects slot. 
Here’s a description of the Adaptive Limiter controls:
	
✓	Margin: The Margin field above the meters shows you the highest peaks 
of the signal.
	
✓	Input Scale: Rotate the Input Scale knob to scale the input signal. You 
can raise the level of quiet signals or lower the level of loud signals with 
this knob. Higher levels can add an analog-sounding distortion that often 
sounds pleasing to the ear. But be careful not to clip the input because 
digital distortion, unlike analog distortion, isn’t a pleasing sound.
	
✓	Gain: Use the Gain knob to get your signal the rest of the way to your 
target level.
	
✓	Out Ceiling: Set your target level with the Out Ceiling knob. For popular 
music, this level is often just below 0 dBFS, for example, -0.02 dBFS.
                           

323
 Chapter 18: Mastering Your Final Track
Matching levels to other recorded material
To gauge whether you’re getting the final level in the same ballpark as your 
marketplace, it’s a good idea to import a reference mix into your project and 
compare it with your mastered track. (You learn how to import media into 
your project in Chapter 8.) It’s a good idea to keep a playlist of mixes that you 
know and love for reference as you work. If you’re working for a client, ask 
them to provide reference tracks so you can do a better job of achieving the 
client’s vision for the project.
If you’ve been putting your mastering effects on the stereo output, all the 
audio you import will be affected by the plug-ins. You can solve this in the fol­
lowing ways:
	
✓	Move the plug-ins on your output to the channel strip of the track you’re 
mastering.
	
✓	Move the plug-ins on your output to an auxiliary channel strip, and then 
route the output of your track to the auxiliary channel strip, as you learn 
in Chapter 16.
After you’ve moved your mastering plug-ins from the output, here’s how to 
A/B between your track and the reference track:
	
1.	Mute the reference track.
	
	 You only hear your mastered track while the reference track is muted.
	
2.	Option-click either track’s solo icon to A/B between the two tracks.
	
	 Option-clicking the solo icon turns solo off on all other tracks, allowing 
you to hear only one track at a time.
	
You can use your ears to judge whether the volume levels of your track and 
the reference track match, or you can measure with an SPL meter. If you’ve cal­
ibrated your listening position with an SPL meter, as you learn in Chapter 16, 
your ear should be a good judge of the levels between the two tracks. Having a 
meter on hand will help you build confidence in your ability to judge volume.

I

think all Logic Pro users anticipate the moment when they can turn their 
full mix into a format that they can share with the world. Seeing a project 
through to the end takes patience and persistence, and you go through so 
many emotions during the process that the project ends up holding a lot of 
personal value. Rendering your full mix to a single audio file (called bouncing) 
is an exciting moment because you make your song real and ready for the 
world.
You have many reasons to want to bounce your project as soon as possible. 
You can deliver it to a DJ. You can test it in your car. You can put it on your 
website. And you can celebrate your creation. In this chapter, you render the 
final audio file and share it with me so I can help you celebrate being a music 
producer.
Bouncing Your Project
You usually end up bouncing several times during the course of a project. 
You might want to listen to your song on the go or share it with someone for 
feedback. And at some point, you’re going to bounce the project because it’s 
complete. In this section, you learn how to render your project into an audio 
file that you can listen to in software such as iTunes.
	
Back up your projects. It’s an awful feeling to lose your precious data due to a 
hard drive crash or, even worse, a stolen computer. You can lessen the pain by 
backing up your data so you can get back to work.
                           

326
Part V: Mixing, Mastering, and Sharing Your Music 
Apple’s Time Machine software, which is installed on your Mac operating 
system, can get you started backing up. It will back up your entire computer 
at regular intervals to an external hard drive or an AirPort Time Capsule. In 
addition, services can back up your data offsite to inexpensive storage solu­
tions such as Amazon S3 or Bitcasa. Finally, you can sync your current proj­
ects between computers and into the cloud using services such as Dropbox. 
And if you’re like me, obsessive at backing up data, you can keep a small 
external hard drive handy and manually back up your current projects. One 
day, you will be thankful that you have your data backed up.
Recording external instruments 
before you bounce
Before you can bounce your project into a single audio file, or even multiple 
audio files for archival, you need to record all your external MIDI instruments 
to audio tracks, as described in Chapter 6. External MIDI instruments are con­
trolled by the MIDI tracks in your project, but the audio of the external instru­
ment needs to be captured in your project on an audio track.
Capturing your software instrument tracks as audio is also a good idea, 
because you never know when a third-party software instrument will become 
obsolete. If you want to future-proof your project, bounce all your software 
instruments to audio tracks. To bounce a software instrument track, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Select a software instrument track.
	
2.	Choose File➪Bounce➪Track in Place, or press Control-⌘-B.
	
	 The Bounce Track In Place dialog opens, as shown in Figure 19-1.
	
3.	Name the file and select your options.
	
	 To retain the track’s current sound and mix automation, deselect Bypass 
Effect Plug-ins and select Include Volume/Pan Automation (the default 
settings). If you want to bounce the raw track, as you would for raw 
archival or sharing with other mix engineers who plan on adding their 
own effects, do the opposite and select Bypass Effect Plug-ins and dese­
lect Include Volume/Pan Automation.
	
4.	Click OK.
	
	 Your software instrument track is bounced to audio and added to a track 
in the project.

Bouncing to an audio file
Bouncing is an exciting step. You’ve been building the house piece by piece, 
and now you finally get to observe it as a whole. Even though the file will 
sound the same as your mix in the project, bouncing is an important final 
step and symbolic of your commitment to the project. You can bounce your 
project in the following ways:
	
1.	Select the length of the section to be bounced by selecting regions, 
by setting the cycle mode, or by deselecting regions to use the project 
end point.
	
	 If cycle mode is off and a region is not selected, Logic Pro defaults to 
bouncing the length of the entire project. If cycle mode is on, Logic Pro 
will use the cycle length to determine the bounce length. If cycle mode 
is off and a region is selected, the bounce length defaults to the length 
of the selected region. I like to determine the bounce length by the cycle 
length. That method allows me to precisely define the start and end 
points to remove empty space in the beginning and capture any reverb 
or delay tails at the end.
	
2.	Start the bounce in either of the following ways:
 
• Click the bounce icon at the bottom of the Stereo Output channel 
strip.
 
• Choose File➪Bounce➪Project or Section, or press ⌘-B.
	
	 The Bounce window opens, as shown in Figure 19-2. You can select the 
destination file type, file type parameters, and bounce mode, and you 
can refine the start and end times. Normalizing raises the level of your 
track to 0 dBFS, so it’s best to leave it off.

4.	Name your file and choose its location.
	
5.	Click Bounce in the dialog window.
	
	 The bounce is processed and the bounced files are saved in the location 
you chose in the preceding step.
	
If you’re completely done with the project, it’s a good idea to export all your 
tracks as audio files. Audio files aren’t going away any time in the distant 
future. Third-party plug-ins and software change regularly, so you never know 
whether your favorite third-party plug-in will work in a later version of Logic 
Pro. Choose File➪Export➪All Tracks as Audio Files or press Shift-⌘-E. In the 
dialog that appears, choose the file location, file type, and file settings. Click 
Save and every track will have a separate audio file. You could also give the 
resulting audio to a Pro Tools user, who would be able to easily import your 
audio and begin mixing right away.
Creating Stems and Alternate Mixes
Bouncing several different versions of your final mix is a common practice. 
Clients have different needs, and alternate versions of mixes can cover all 
your bases. Sometimes, artists need versions without the vocal for perform­
ing live to backing tracks. You may even need to bounce groups of tracks sep­
arately, creating a stem mix. Whatever your needs, bouncing alternate mixes 
and stems is easy using Logic Pro.
                           

329
 Chapter 19: Bouncing and Sharing Your Music
Bouncing a stem mix
Stem mixes have many uses. You can give a remix artist the stems of the mix 
for remixing and DJ gigs. Film scores and surround sound projects often use 
music stems. Mixing and mastering engineers might want stems instead of 
individual tracks or bounced stereo tracks.
The fastest way to create a stem is to solo the tracks you want to include in 
the stem and bounce as described previously. Name and catalog your stems 
clearly. That way, they’re easy to recognize and you won’t accidentally leave 
out individual tracks.
The stems you create will depend on your project and collaborators. A 
remixer might want separate vocals, drums, and musical instruments. A film 
score might want to separate the orchestra from any electronic instruments 
or sound effects. If stems are required, you can meet the demand.
	
You can also use track stacks to build and organize your stems. By using track 
stacks, it’s easy to solo or mute the instruments in the track stack for bounc­
ing the stems.
Bouncing alternate mixes
When it comes to mixing popular music, you can make several common alter­
nate mixes. And it’s probably best to make them even if no one asks for them. 
Making an alternate mix takes little time, and you may end up liking one of 
the alternates better. Here’s a list of common alternate mixes:
	
✓	Without vocals: This mix can be used when a performer needs to sing 
to a backing track. TV appearances often use live vocals with backing 
tracks instead of live performers to guarantee great sound. An alternate 
version of this mix is to leave the background vocals in, known as the TV 
mix. This type of mix is also useful if your song ends up being used for 
karaoke.
	
✓	Vocals only: This mix is loved by remixers and DJs because they can 
provide their own beats and music under the lead vocal track. It can also 
be mixed with the vocal-free backing track version when film and TV 
editors need independent control of the vocal level because it coincides 
with dialog.
	
✓	Vocal up/vocal down: These mixes involve raising and lowering the 
overall level of the lead vocal 1 or 2 dB. The change in level is subtle but 
often necessary to please the discerning ears of your clients.
	
✓	Without solo: If the song has a solo instrument or solo section, you 
might treat it as a lead vocal and provide versions with and without the 
solo instrument.

Sharing Your Music
You’ve poured your heart and soul into Logic Pro, and now that you’re done, 
what do you do? Share it with your friends, including me! I love listening to 
new artists. There’s an audience out there who hasn’t discovered your music 
and wants to hear it. In this section, you discover how to get your music 
heard.
Sharing your project to iTunes
If you bounced your project files already, you can open them in iTunes from 
Finder. But you can bounce and share your project also directly with iTunes, 
so you can sync your project to your iOS devices and play your tracks wher­
ever you go. Choose File➪Share➪Song to iTunes to display the Share to 
iTunes window, shown in Figure 19-3. Name your project and set the tags, 
choose the quality level and bounce length, and click Share. The bounce is 
processed and imported to iTunes, ready to play and sync.
	
Figure 19-3: 
The Share

window.
	
Sharing your project to the media browser
You can share your project with other applications such as iMovie and Final 
Cut Pro using the media browser. Choose File➪Share➪Media Browser to open 
the Share to Media Browser window. Name the file and choose the sound 
quality. Click Share to add your bounced file to the media browser.
                           

331
 Chapter 19: Bouncing and Sharing Your Music
	
If you consolidate your project, audio you’ve shared with the media browser is 
removed. Sharing with the media browser isn’t permanent. It’s not a means for 
backup. You’re better off sharing your project with iTunes or bouncing to your 
hard drive and importing your music into other projects from Finder.
Sharing your project to SoundCloud
New to Logic Pro X is SoundCloud sharing. SoundCloud is an online service 
and social network for posting and sharing audio. The service is free, and you 
can set up and begin sharing your music quickly. Choose File➪Share➪Share 
to SoundCloud. The first time you visit the site, you’re asked to enter your 
username and password, so you must be connected to the Internet.
When you’re logged in, the Share to SoundCloud window opens, as shown 
in Figure 19-4. Enter your details and click Share. Your audio is processed on 
SoundCloud’s servers and added to your profile, ready to share in minutes.

ogic Remote is a free app for iPads running iOS 7.0 or higher. With Logic 
Remote, you can remotely control three Apple music apps on your Mac: 
Logic Pro, GarageBand, and MainStage. You connect Logic Remote to your 
music app with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Download Logic Remote at http://
logicstudiotraining.com/logicremote.
When you open Logic Remote, it attempts to connect to the software running 
on your Mac, so you must have Logic Pro, GarageBand, or MainStage running. 
Otherwise, Logic Remote will shut down. If you have more than one of these 
applications running, you’re asked to choose the application you want to 
control. After you’re connected, you can control the application using your 
iPad.
In this chapter, you learn how to use your iPad to play software instruments, 
edit your tracks, mix your project, and write songs.
Playing Keys
The first thing you should check out in the Logic Remote app is the control 
bar at the top of the interface, shown in Figure 20-1. The center display shows 
the playhead location, the track name, and the track number. You can navi­
gate through the track list with the arrows on either side of the display.

Figure 20-1: 
The Logic 
Remote 
library.
	
Tap the view icon to navigate to different views, including the touch instru­
ments, mixer, smart help, and key commands. The View menu is dynamic and 
gives you options based on the selected track. For example, drummer tracks 
have a kit view while keyboard tracks have a chord strip view.
Tap the library icon to open the patch library. From the Patch Library menu, 
you can access your entire Logic Pro library and choose new patches for the 
currently selected track. Logic Remote does its best to recognize the instru­
ment you load and give you the right tools for the job. Load a bass guitar 
patch, and Logic Remote will display a fretboard. Load a drum patch, and 
Logic Remote will display drum pads. The Logic Remote smart controls give 
you cool-looking interfaces that are easy to use and fun to play. Check out my 
favorite, the vintage keys.
Playing Guitar
If you’re a guitar player, you may prefer to play all Logic Pro software instru­
ments by using a fretboard on your iPad. If you’re not a guitar player, the fret­
board is easy to learn (tap the frets to play notes), and frets can inspire you 
to play differently. You can drag the strings up or down to bend notes, just 
like on a guitar. You can also play with chord strips, as shown in Figure 20-2.
                           

337
 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Use an iPad with Logic Pro X
	
Figure 20-2: 
The acous-
tic guitar 
chord strips.
	
To view the chord strips, tap the view icon and choose the chord strips. Tap 
the top of the chord strip to play all six strings at once. You can tap any indi­
vidual string to play it or swipe up and down along the chord strip to simu­
late strumming. The chord strips can be a wonderful songwriting tool. You 
can use them to quickly try out different chord progressions as you write. 
Even a musical virtuoso will find chord strips handy for focusing exclusively 
on harmony.
Playing Drums
Logic Remote turns your iPad into an easy-to-use beat maker. With an 
Ultrabeat track selected, you can view a large screen of 24 drum pads. With 
a Drum Kit Designer track selected, you can choose the kit view, as shown 
in Figure 20-3. The drums are touch-sensitive. If you tap a drum with two 
fingers, it plays repeating notes (great for hi-hat), and as you spread your fin­
gers apart, the pattern gets faster (great for drum rolls).
                           

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
Figure 20-3: 
The drum kit 
view.
	
Both Ultrabeat and Drummer are tightly integrated in Logic Remote. The 
smart controls take on the look and feel of the instruments, helping you to 
quickly adjust as you change between tracks. But you’re not restricted to the 
controls Logic Remote gives you. You’re more than welcome to play drums 
using frets, a keyboard, or even chord strips. And while you’re thinking about 
it, you can use drum pads (but not the drum kit) to play keyboard and guitar 
parts. That should help you compose something new and different.
Editing Tracks and Your Arrangement
Editing is often filled with repetitive tasks. When you find yourself choosing 
the same menus and functions over and over again, open the key commands 
view, shown in Figure 20-4, and add a customized key command.
To add a key command, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the view menu and choose the Key Commands view.
	
	 The key commands view opens.
	
2.	Tap an empty key command space.
	
	 The key command search dialog opens.
                           

339
 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Use an iPad with Logic Pro X
	
3.	Browse or search for the key command.
	
4.	Tap the key command.
	
	 The key command is added to the space.
	
Figure 20-4: 
Logic 
Remote key 
commands.
	
	
Several commands to split regions will save you from having to switch to the 
scissors tool. You can add key commands to set your locators, nudge regions, 
and go to markers so you can edit your arrangement and your tracks quickly.
Using Your iPad Mixing Console
Tap the view icon and choose the mixer. In my opinion, the mixer, shown in 
Figure 20-5, is worth the entire price of the iPad. I’ve spent a lot more money 
on various MIDI controllers and control surfaces to get the same functionality 
that I get from a simple and elegant free iPad app. And I never found a solu­
tion that was as easy to set up and use as Logic Remote.
                           

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
Figure 20-5: 
The mixer.
	
The mixer shows you level meters; icons for automation, record, mute, and 
solo; pan knobs; faders; and the track names and numbers. You can swipe 
across the track names or meters to show different groups of faders. To view 
effects sends in the mixer, tap the Sends 1-4 icon beside the master fader.
	
Many audio engineers like to listen to their mix from right outside the control 
room to test how it sounds from a distance. But not every engineer can listen 
from outside the room and make changes from an iPad. And with smart con­
trols, you have the most important controls at your fingertips.
Recording Remotely
For many laptop artists, the computer is inseparable from the art. Unfortu­
nately, so is the laptop fan noise. And as you add professional mics and 
preamps to your studio, they get better at picking up all the imperfections of 
your recording environment. With Logic Remote, you can leave the computer 
where it won’t impede the quality of your recording.
To begin recording on the selected track, tap the record icon on the trans­
port. Tap the stop icon when you’re finished. Tap the cycle mode icon to 
record multiple takes, as described in Chapter 6.
                           

341
 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Use an iPad with Logic Pro X
Commanding Logic Pro
Tap the settings icon to open the edit and track submenus, as shown in 
Figure 20-6. On this menu, you can undo and redo edits, create and duplicate 
tracks, adjust the velocity range of the touch instruments, and open Logic 
Remote Help.
	
Figure 20-6: 
Logic 
Remote 
settings.
	
	
It’s probably a good idea to add a key command to save your project. (See 
“Editing Tracks and Your Arrangement” section to find out how to add custom 
key commands.) In addition to adding a key command to save your project, 
you can add other project commands such as New Empty Project, Close 
Project, and Close Project without Saving.
Navigating Logic Pro
The control bar display shows you the location of the playhead in musical 
time or clock time, depending on the general project settings. Tap the control 
bar display, and a ruler opens below the control bar, as shown in Figure 20-7. 
Swipe left or right in the ruler or display area to move the playhead.

The benefit of having a computer keyboard with a numeric keypad is that the 
numeric keys are assigned to marker numbers. If you’re working on a laptop or 
with a keyboard that doesn’t have a numeric keypad, you can create key com­
mands in Logic Remote that go to marker numbers. (See the “Editing Tracks 
and Your Arrangement” section for information on creating key commands.) If 
you want to edit a key command, tap it with two fingers to remove or replace 
the key command or give it a color.
Sketching Songs with GarageBand
You can start any project in GarageBand for iOS (iPhone, iPad, or iPod 
touch), import it to GarageBand on your Mac to work on it a little more, and 
then import it to Logic Pro. The workflow is smooth. One benefit of using all 
three apps is that you have a version of the project saved on your iOS device, 
in your GarageBand projects folder, and in your Logic Pro projects folder. 
Redundant backups will save the day.
                           

343
 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Use an iPad with Logic Pro X
GarageBand for iOS is a simple app to master. It has a limited feature set but 
gives you more recording and editing capabilities than The Beatles had in 
their early days. Plus, you can use its many auto-accompaniment features, 
such as smart drums, shown in Figure 20-8, to sketch new songs. Tap the set­
tings icon (wrench) to open the GarageBand help system.

GarageBand for Mac and iOS are both free apps. With your Logic Pro knowl­
edge, I’m confident that you’ll master GarageBand quickly. To find out more

Importing iPad Audio
GarageBand for iOS is capable of recording other music applications on your 
device through Inter-App Audio. Many iOS apps support the Inter-App Audio 
protocol. It’s a great way to get audio from your third-party synths and drum 
                           

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
machines into GarageBand and, eventually, into Logic Pro. In GarageBand 
for iOS, here’s how to record audio from an app with Inter-App Audio 
capabilities:
	
1.	Tap the Instruments button, which is at the top of the interface.
	
	 The touch instrument browser opens, as shown in Figure 20-9.
	
2.	In the instrument browser, choose Inter-App Audio Apps.
	
	 The screen updates to show you apps capable of inter-app audio.
	
3.	Choose the app you want to add to your song.	
	
	 An audio track is added to your song using the output of your inter-
app audio app. You can now record audio from the chosen app within 
GarageBand.
	
Figure 20-9: 
The Garage­
Band touch 
instrument 
browser.
	
	
You can also use third-party audio effects via Inter-App Audio. Some fantas­
tic sounding guitar amp simulators can be used as an effect on your audio 
tracks. Recording apps into GarageBand for iOS and then importing projects 
to your computer is a simple and effective way to get the most from your iPad, 
GarageBand, and Logic Pro X.

Ten Tips to Speed Your Workflow
In This Chapter

▶	Using key commands and screensets
▶	Saving time with patches and presets
▶	Troubleshooting and mastering Logic Pro
F

inishing a Logic Pro project is like completing a puzzle: You have to fit 
all the pieces together to see the final picture. Some parts of the game 
are more fun than others, so you need a good reason to see it through, such 
as the enjoyment of listening to your project come together. A better moti­
vator is to make every moment that you create with Logic Pro a purposeful 
moment.
Start by giving your Logic Pro project deadlines and clear outcomes. If you 
don’t have a song to work on, create a learning project. I create projects to 
learn tools, workflows, plug-ins, and software instruments, in addition to 
songwriting and music producing. You’ll speed up your chops with experi­
ence, especially if your purpose is clear.
In this chapter, I offer practical tips to help you speed up your workflow and 
make more music.
Keep Detailed Notes
I start almost every project by opening the project notes (Option-⌘-P). I 
write a brief sentence about my project goal, and I sign my projects, adding 
my URL and copyright notice. That simple sentence alone will save you time 
as you search through projects for stuff. Sometimes I need to find a piece of 
music or an effects chain to use in a current project, and the search is much 
easier when each project has a short description in the notes.
                           

346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Project notes are also an ideal place to list all your deliverables. In Chapter 16, 
I list the fundamentals of mixing; I like to collect all that information in the 
project notes. I list reference tracks, effects ideas, track groups, bar numbers, 
lyrics, and anything else I can dump out of my brain. I also use project notes as 
a to-do list so I can keep track of what I’ve done and what’s left to do.
Use track notes to store specific information about the track, such as instru­
ment frequency ranges and effects chains. I also keep a change log of signifi­
cant edits and patches or channel strip settings. Sometimes, I’ll change the 
patch or channel strip setting of a track, but I always write down the name of 
the current patch. Keeping notes saves you from having to commit anything 
to memory, so you have more mental energy for the music.
Use Key Commands
You can use more than 1,200 key commands in Logic Pro X — many more 
than you’ll ever need. But many Logic Pro functions can be achieved only by 
key command, so one key command you should memorize is Option-K, which 
opens the key commands window.
If there’s anything you want to do in your project, you can search through 
menus to find it, or you can quickly open the key commands window and 
search. The second way is usually faster. Open the key commands window 
regularly and search for commands related to your task.
	
Keep one key combination for ad hoc key command assignments. When you 
find a key command that doesn’t have an assignment, you don’t have to find 
a permanent home for it right away. You can assign it to your temp key com­
mand and use it immediately. My temp key command is Control-Option-⌘-K, 
and I can remember it easily because it’s similar to Option-K.
Use Screensets
Screensets are snapshots of your current screen layout. I use them all the 
time. To access your screensets, press any number key on your keyboard 
from 1 to 9. Hold Control for the first digit of double-digit screensets. I 
reserve screenset 9 for project notes and 8 for track notes, and they’re the 
first screensets I create. I also lock my screensets. That way, I can move them 
around but get them back to their locked position by pressing the screenset 
number.
                           

347
 Chapter 21: Ten Tips to Speed Your Workflow
If you’ve downloaded the templates I’ve shared with you throughout this 
book at http://logicstudiotraining.com/lpxfordummies, you’ve 
seen my detailed screensets. Each task deserves a screenset. I have a project 
of audio editing screensets, MIDI editing screensets, and mixing screensets, 
and I regularly import them to my current project, as described in Chapter 2. 
If you have my templates, you can import them as well.
	
As with key commands, keep an ad hoc screenset that you can set up and 
duplicate from the screenset menu. I usually reserve screenset 1 for my ad hoc 
workspace and then duplicate it
Save Track Stack Patches and 
Channel Strip Settings
Track stacks are one of my favorite Logic Pro X features. They’re easy to 
pass back and forth and they free your precious time. You can save groups 
of tracks, effects chains, instrument sounds, and so much more. I provide an 
entire orchestra patch in Chapter 12 that you can add to any project. Track 
stacks and patches are massive timesavers.
You can also save project templates to save time, but merging templates 
isn’t as easy as loading a few patches. Open the library (Y) and load several 
patches, and you have a complete band and orchestra with all the audio rout­
ing and effects you can imagine.
I like to save channel strip settings almost as much as patches. Adding a 
common set of plug-ins to a channel strip is easy from the mixer. Open the 
mixer (X) and save the channel strip settings from the Setting button at the 
top of the channel strip. When I get a good sound going, I save it as both a 
channel strip setting and a patch in the library. They make great starting 
places for future projects.
Choose a Tool and Master It
If you spend an entire week focusing on a new tool while you work on your 
projects, you’ll know its strengths and weaknesses and you’ll know exactly 
when to use it. Press T to open the tool menu. Press T twice to select the pen 
tool, the most common tool.
                           

348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Master the pointer, pencil, marquee, scissors, and zoom tools. You’ll use 
them a lot. Editors can be tools too. Spend a week using the step editor in 
your projects, and you’ll master it. Spend a week working on flex time, score 
editing, smart controls, and the other powerful features and you’ll dominate 
Logic Pro.
Choose a Tool and Ignore It
Logic Pro is so deep that you’ll probably never touch some of its features. 
You might never need to open the score editor if you don’t read music. You 
might never mix your own music. Whatever your situation, feel free to ignore 
what you don’t need.
Many new Logic Pro users come to me wanting to learn it front to back. I 
always question their motivation because I’ve never known a music producer 
who uses Logic Pro that way. The goal isn’t to master Logic Pro; the goal is to 
have Logic Pro help you master making music.
Use the Fastest Way, Not the Right Way
I’ve wasted a lot of time trying and failing to do something that I knew should 
be possible. Instead of beating your head against the desk like I do, if some­
thing isn’t working, ask yourself whether there’s another way to accomplish 
the same goal. Sometimes what seems like the right way isn’t always the fast­
est way.
A long time ago, I tried to create a template that was perfectly connected to 
my studio environment. I added external MIDI instruments for all my synths, 
audio tracks for all my inputs, software instruments that I always used, and 
a detailed MIDI controller setup so I could control every knob and fader. It 
should have worked, but it never truly did. And I didn’t make a whole lot of 
music during that experiment.
There’s no such thing as perfect software. But there is such a thing as soft­
ware used well. My motto is: A proper project is a finished project.
                           

349
 Chapter 21: Ten Tips to Speed Your Workflow
Establish a Troubleshooting Strategy
It’s not often that I have to troubleshoot Logic Pro. But when I do, I use the 
following strategy:
	
1.	Is the problem with the hardware?
	
	 Test all your hardware, including instruments, cables, audio interface, 
speakers, and anything else that could be connected to your system. 
Check the computer’s audio system preferences.
	
2.	Is the problem with the software?
	
	 Test different projects and new projects. Check the Logic Pro prefer­
ences and the I/O buffer size.
	
3.	Is the problem with the project?
	
	 Import parts of the project into a new project. Gradually add more parts 
of the project.
	
4.	Is the problem with a project component?
	
	 Test your third-party effects and software instrument plug-ins.
I almost always find a solution by searching in this order. If I don’t, I then 
search online and visit the Apple discussion forums. Set a time limit for 
troubleshooting before you ask for help online. Then set a time limit for your

Save and Back Up Frequently
In Chapter 19, I plead with you to back up your work. One of the greatest 
productivity tips of all time is don’t lose your data. Digital storage is getting 
cheaper and cheaper, and you can find many free storage services online. 
Back up your data.
I’ve had hard drives fail. I’ve dropped hard drives. I’ve deleted things by 
mistake. But I don’t lose time. I have onsite and offsite backups plus I sync 
my core projects. I call this process abundance by redundancy. Backing up 
doesn’t take much time to set up and is easy to automate. Search for cloud 
storage and backup or something similar and you’ll be presented with com­
petitive offers.
I don’t like to brag about my backup system, but I do think it is great. I can 
vouch for its effectiveness, and I’ve most certainly needed it.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Lose Sight of the Music
Sometimes you have to make things more complicated before you can make 
them simple. When you have a song that you’re going to record, you have to 
break it into parts and rebuild it so you can share it. When you compose, you 
essentially break your ideas apart and rebuild them. Logic Pro is a tool to 
help you compose, record, mix, and produce your own music.
Songs are waiting to be written. Singers are waiting for you to record them. 
Bands are waiting for you to mix them. Listeners are waiting for you to pro­
duce music for them.

Author’s Acknowledgments
I couldn’t have completed this book without Katie Heikkinen cheering for me. 
I’m a lucky man to have the unconditional support of an amazing woman. To 
tell the truth, I wrote the book only to impress her. I’d also like to thank my 
mom, Jennifer, and my brother, Brian, for always believing in me and remind­
ing me to selflessly contribute for the greater good. Thank you to Brian’s 
family — Jodi, Elliot, and Gabriel — for moving closer and giving me the 
opportunity to let go and play! I love my family!
I’d like to thank my best friend and the cofounder of logicstudiotraining.com, 
Rob Fulton, for being a massive support while I wrote this book. When you 
take on an intense and long-lasting project such as a Dummies book, you 
need a friend who makes you stronger, like Rob. Thanks, man. Deep thanks 
go to my coach, John Chancellor, for keeping me accountable and continually 
encouraging me while I wrote this book. I’d also like to thank Bobby Owsinski 
for showing me the ropes and being a trusted mentor.
Thank you to Aaron Black, for staying in touch through the years and making 
this book happen. Susan Pink deserves a massive round of applause for 
making the book better and leading the way to victory. I couldn’t have asked 
for a better project and copy editor. Thank you, Susan! My special thanks go 
to editors Leah Michael and Ryan Williams for contributing to this book and 
helping to deliver the best possible content. I’d also like to thank Dummies 
and Wiley for setting the bar high and caring about giving the best possible 
value to the reader. I’m honored to write a Dummies book.
Finally, I’d like to thank all the enthusiastic and passionate Logic Pro users. 
You’ve created an enormous community that loves to support one another. 
You ask a lot of questions, you give a lot of answers, and you make a lot 
of music. I hope I can help you make more music, and I hope you share 
it with other Logic Pro X For Dummies readers at www.facebook.com/
logicproxfordummies.
