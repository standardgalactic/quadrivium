CLOUD SECURITY
FUNDAMENTALS AND SHARED
RESPONSIBILITY MODEL
Key principles of cloud security include data
encryption, identity and access management
(IAM), network security, patch management,
and logging and monitoring.
The shared responsibility model divides security
responsibilities between cloud providers and
customers.
Cloud 
computing 
offers 
flexibility 
and
scalability, but it also presents unique security
challenges due to the migration of sensitive
data and the complexity of cloud environments.
