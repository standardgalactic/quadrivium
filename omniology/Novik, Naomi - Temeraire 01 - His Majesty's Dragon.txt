Chapter 1 
 
THE DECK OF the French ship was slippery with blood, heaving in the choppy sea; a stroke might as 
easily bring down the man making it as the intended target. Laurence did not have time in the heat of the 
battle to be surprised at the degree of resistance, but even through the numbing haze of battle-fever and 
the confusion of swords and pistol-smoke, he marked the extreme look of anguish on the French 
captain’s face as the man shouted encouragement to his men. 
It was still there shortly thereafter, when they met on the deck, and the man surrendered his sword, very 
reluctantly: at the last moment his hand half-closed about the blade, as if he meant to draw it back. 
Laurence looked up to make certain the colors had been struck, then accepted the sword with a mute

bow; he did not speak French himself, and a more formal exchange would have to wait for the presence 
of his third lieutenant, that young man being presently engaged belowdecks in securing the French guns. 
With the cessation of hostilities, the remaining Frenchmen were all virtually dropping where they stood; 
Laurence noticed that there were fewer of them than he would have expected for a frigate of thirty-six 
guns, and that they looked ill and hollow-cheeked. 
Many of them lay dead or dying upon the deck; he shook his head at the waste and eyed the French 
captain with disapproval: the man should never have offered battle. Aside from the plain fact that the 
Reliant would have had the Amitié slightly outgunned and outmanned under the best of circumstances, 
the crew had obviously been reduced by disease or hunger. To boot, the sails above them were in a sad 
tangle, and that no result of the battle, but of the storm which had passed but this morning; they had 
barely managed to bring off a single broadside before the Reliant had closed and boarded. The captain 
was obviously deeply overset by the defeat, but he was not a young man to be carried away by his 
spirits: he ought to have done better by his men than to bring them into so hopeless an action. 
“Mr. Riley,” Laurence said, catching his second lieutenant’s attention, “have our men carry the wounded 
below.” He hooked the captain’s sword on his belt; he did not think the man deserved the compliment of 
having it returned to him, though ordinarily he would have done so. “And pass the word for Mr. Wells.” 
“Very good, sir,” Riley said, turning to issue the necessary orders. Laurence stepped to the railing to 
look down and see what damage the hull had taken. She looked reasonably intact, and he had ordered his 
own men to avoid shots below the waterline; he thought with satisfaction that there would be no 
difficulty in bringing her into port. 
His hair had slipped out of his short queue, and now fell into his eyes as he looked over. He impatiently 
pushed it out of the way as he turned back, leaving streaks of blood upon his forehead and the sun-
bleached hair; this, with his broad shoulders and his severe look, gave him an unconsciously savage 
appearance as he surveyed his prize, very unlike his usual thoughtful expression. 
Wells climbed up from below in response to the summons and came to his side. “Sir,” he said, without 
waiting to be addressed, “begging your pardon, but Lieutenant Gibbs says there is something queer in 
the hold.” 
“Oh? I will go and look,” Laurence said. “Pray tell this gentleman,” he indicated the French captain, 
“that he must give me his parole, for himself and his men, or they must be confined.” 
The French captain did not immediately respond; he looked at his men with a miserable expression. 
They would of course do much better if they could be kept spread out through the lower deck, and any 
recapture was a practical impossibility under the circumstances; still he hesitated, drooped, and finally 
husked, “Je me rends,” with a look still more wretched. 
Laurence gave a short nod. “He may go to his cabin,” he told Wells, and turned to step down into the 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (4 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:33

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
hold. “Tom, will you come along? Very good.” 
He descended with Riley on his heels, and found his first lieutenant waiting for him. Gibbs’s round face 
was still shining with sweat and emotion; he would be taking the prize into port, and as she was a 
frigate, he almost certainly would be made post, a captain himself. Laurence was only mildly pleased; 
though Gibbs had done his duty reasonably, the man had been imposed on him by the Admiralty and 
they had not become intimates. He had wanted Riley in the first lieutenant’s place, and if he had been 
given his way, Riley would now be the one getting his step. That was the nature of the service, and he 
did not begrudge Gibbs the good fortune; still, he did not rejoice quite so wholeheartedly as he would 
have to see Tom get his own ship. 
“Very well; what’s all this, then?” Laurence said now; the hands were clustered about an oddly placed 
bulkhead towards the stern area of the hold, neglecting the work of cataloguing the captured ship’s 
stores. 
“Sir, if you will step this way,” Gibbs said. “Make way there,” he ordered, and the hands backed away 
from what Laurence now saw was a doorway set inside a wall that had been built across the back of the 
hold; recently, for the lumber was markedly lighter than the surrounding planks. 
Ducking through the low door, he found himself in a small chamber with a strange appearance. The 
walls had been reinforced with actual metal, which must have added a great deal of unnecessary weight 
to the ship, and the floor was padded with old sailcloth; in addition, there was a small coal-stove in the 
corner, though this was not presently in use. The only object stored within the room was a large crate, 
roughly the height of a man’s waist and as wide, and this was made fast to the floor and walls by means 
of thick hawsers attached to metal rings. 
Laurence could not help feeling the liveliest curiosity, and after a moment’s struggle he yielded to it. 
“Mr. Gibbs, I think we shall have a look inside,” he said, stepping out of the way. The top of the crate 
was thoroughly nailed down, but eventually yielded to the many willing hands; they pried it off and 
lifted out the top layer of packing, and many heads craned forward at the same time to see. 
No one spoke, and in silence Laurence stared at the shining curve of eggshell rising out of the heaped 
straw; it was scarcely possible to believe. “Pass the word for Mr. Pollitt,” he said at last; his voice 
sounded only a little strained. “Mr. Riley, pray be sure those lashings are quite secure.” 
Riley did not immediately answer, too busy staring; then he jerked to attention and said, hastily, “Yes, 
sir,” and bent to check the bindings. 
Laurence stepped closer and gazed down at the egg. There could hardly be any doubt as to its nature, 
though he could not say for sure from his own experience. The first amazement passing, he tentatively 
reached out and touched the surface, very cautiously: it was smooth and hard to the touch. He withdrew 
almost at once, not wanting to risk doing it some harm. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (5 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:33

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Mr. Pollitt came down into the hold in his awkward way, clinging to the ladder edges with both hands 
and leaving bloody prints upon it; he was no kind of a sailor, having become a naval surgeon only at the 
late age of thirty, after some unspecified disappointments on land. He was nevertheless a genial man, 
well liked by the crew, even if his hand was not always the steadiest at the operating table. “Yes, sir?” he 
said, then saw the egg. “Good Lord above.” 
“It is a dragon egg, then?” Laurence said. It required an effort to restrain the triumph in his voice. 
“Oh, yes indeed, Captain, the size alone shows that.” Mr. Pollitt had wiped his hands on his apron and 
was already brushing more straw away from the top, trying to see the extent. “My, it is quite hardened 
already; I wonder what they can have been thinking, so far from land.” 
This did not sound very promising. “Hardened?” Laurence said sharply. “What does that mean?” 
“Why, that it will hatch soon. I will have to consult my books to be certain, but I believe that Badke’s 
Bestiary states with authority that when the shell has fully hardened, hatching will occur within a week. 
What a splendid specimen, I must get my measuring cords.” 
He bustled away, and Laurence exchanged a glance with Gibbs and Riley, moving closer so they might 
speak without being overheard by the lingering gawkers. “At least three weeks from Madeira with a fair 
wind, would you say?” Laurence said quietly. 
“At best, sir,” Gibbs said, nodding. 
“I cannot imagine how they came to be here with it,” Riley said. “What do you mean to do, sir?” 
His initial satisfaction turning gradually into dismay as he realized the very difficult situation, Laurence 
stared at the egg blankly. Even in the dim lantern light, it shone with the warm luster of marble. “Oh, I 
am damned if I know, Tom. But I suppose I will go and return the French captain his sword; it is no 
wonder he fought so furiously after all.” 
  
Except of course he did know; there was only one possible solution, unpleasant as it might be to 
contemplate. Laurence watched broodingly while the egg was transferred, still in its crate, over to the 
Reliant: the only grim man, except for the French officers. He had granted them the liberty of the 
quarterdeck, and they watched the slow process glumly from the rail. All around them, smiles wreathed 
every sailor’s face, private, gloating smiles, and there was a great deal of jostling among the idle hands, 
with many unnecessary cautions and pieces of advice called out to the sweating group of men engaged 
in the actual business of the transfer. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (6 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:33

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
The egg being safely deposited on the deck of the Reliant, Laurence took his own leave of Gibbs. “I will 
leave the prisoners with you; there is no sense in giving them a motive for some desperate attempt to 
recapture the egg,” he said. “Keep in company, as well as you can. However, if we are separated, we 
will rendezvous at Madeira. You have my most hearty congratulations, Captain,” he added, shaking 
Gibbs’s hand. 
“Thank you, sir, and may I say, I am most sensible—very grateful—” But here Gibbs’s eloquence, never 
in great supply, failed him; he gave up and merely stood beaming widely on Laurence and all the world, 
full of great goodwill. 
The ships had been brought abreast for the transfer of the crate; Laurence did not have to take a boat, but 
only sprang across on the up-roll of the swell. Riley and the rest of his officers had already crossed back. 
He gave the order to make sail, and went directly below, to wrestle with the problem in privacy. 
But no obliging alternative presented itself overnight. The next morning, he bowed to necessity and gave 
his orders, and shortly the midshipmen and lieutenants of the ship came crowding into his cabin, 
scrubbed and nervous in their best gear; this sort of mass summons was unprecedented, and the cabin 
was not quite large enough to hold them all comfortably. Laurence saw anxious looks on many faces, 
undoubtedly conscious of some private guilt, curiosity on others; Riley alone looked worried, perhaps 
suspecting something of Laurence’s intentions. 
Laurence cleared his throat; he was already standing, having ordered his desk and chair removed to 
make more room, though he had kept back his inkstand and pen with several sheets of paper, now 
resting upon the sill of the stern windows behind him. “Gentlemen,” he said, “you have all heard by now 
that we found a dragon egg aboard the prize; Mr. Pollitt has very firmly identified it for us.” 
Many smiles and some surreptitious elbowing; the little midshipman Battersea piped up in his treble 
voice, “Congratulations, sir!” and a quick pleased rumble went around. 
Laurence frowned; he understood their high spirits, and if the circumstances had been only a little 
different, he would have shared them. The egg would be worth a thousand times its weight in gold, 
brought safely to shore; every man aboard the ship would have shared in the bounty, and as captain he 
himself would have taken the largest share of the value. 
The Amitié’s logs had been thrown overboard, but her hands had been less discreet than her officers, and 
Wells had learned enough from their complaints to explain the delay all too clearly. Fever among the 
crew, becalmed in the doldrums for the better part of a month, a leak in her water tanks leaving her on 
short water rations, and then at last the gale that they themselves had so recently weathered. It had been 
a string of exceptionally bad luck, and Laurence knew the superstitious souls of his men would quail at 
the idea that the Reliant was now carrying the egg that had undoubtedly been the cause of it. 
He would certainly take care to keep that information from the crew, however; better by far that they not 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (7 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:33

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
know of the long series of disasters which the Amitié had suffered. So after silence fell again, all 
Laurence said was simply, “Unfortunately, the prize had a very bad crossing of it. She must have 
expected to make landfall nearly a month ago, if not more, and the delay has made the circumstances 
surrounding the egg urgent.” There was puzzlement and incomprehension now on most faces, though 
looks of concern were beginning to spread, and he finished the matter off by saying, “In short, 
gentlemen, it is about to hatch.” 
Another low murmur, this time disappointed, and even a few quiet groans; ordinarily he would have 
marked the offenders for a mild later rebuke, but as it was, he let them by. They would soon have more 
cause to groan. So far they had not yet understood what it meant; they merely made the mental reduction 
of the bounty on an unhatched egg to that paid for a feral dragonet, much less valuable. 
“Perhaps not all of you are aware,” he said, silencing the whispers with a look, “that England is in a very 
dire situation as regards the Aerial Corps. Naturally, our handling is superior, and the Corps can outfly 
any other nation of the world, but the French can outbreed us two to one, and it is impossible to deny 
that they have better variety in their bloodlines. A properly harnessed dragon is worth at least a first-rate 
of one hundred guns to us, even a common Yellow Reaper or a three-ton Winchester, and Mr. Pollitt 
believes from the size and color of the egg that this hatchling is a prime specimen, and very likely one of 
the rare large breeds.” 
“Oh!” said Midshipman Carver, in tones of horror, as he took Laurence’s meaning; he instantly went 
crimson as eyes went to him, and shut his mouth tight. 
Laurence ignored the interruption; Riley would see Carver’s grog stopped for a week without having to 
be told. The exclamation had at least prepared the others. “We must at least make the attempt to harness 
the beast,” he said. “I trust, gentlemen, that there is no man here who is not prepared to do his duty for 
England. The Corps may not be the sort of life that any of us has been raised to, but the Navy is no 
sinecure either, and there is not one of you who does not understand a hard service.” 
“Sir,” said Lieutenant Fanshawe anxiously: he was a young man of very good family, the son of an earl. 
“Do you mean—that is, shall we all—” 
There was an emphasis on that all which made it obviously a selfish suggestion, and Laurence felt 
himself go near purple with anger. He snapped, “We all shall, indeed, Mr. Fanshawe, unless there is any 
man here who is too much of a coward to make the attempt, and in that case that gentleman may explain 
himself to a court-martial when we put in at Madeira.” He sent an angry glare around the room, and no 
one else met his eye or offered a protest. 
He was all the more infuriated for understanding the sentiment, and for sharing it himself. Certainly no 
man not raised to the life could be easy at the prospect of suddenly becoming an aviator, and he loathed 
the necessity of asking his officers to face it. It meant, after all, an end to any semblance of ordinary life. 
It was not like sailing, where you might hand your ship back to the Navy and be set ashore, often 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (8 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:33

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
whether you liked it or not. 
Even in times of peace, a dragon could not be put into dock, nor allowed to wander loose, and to keep a 
full-grown beast of twenty tons from doing exactly as it pleased took very nearly the full attention of an 
aviator and a crew of assistants besides. They could not really be managed by force, and were finicky 
about their handlers; some would not accept management at all, even when new-hatched, and none 
would accept it after their first feeding. A feral dragon could be kept in the breeding grounds by the 
constant provision of food, mates, and comfortable shelter, but it could not be controlled outside, and it 
would not speak with men. 
So if a hatchling let you put it into harness, duty forever after tied you to the beast. An aviator could not 
easily manage any sort of estate, nor raise a family, nor go into society to any real extent. They lived as 
men apart, and largely outside the law, for you could not punish an aviator without losing the use of his 
dragon. In peacetime they lived in a sort of wild, outrageous libertinage in small enclaves, generally in 
the most remote and inhospitable places in all Britain, where the dragons could be given at least some 
freedom. Though the men of the Corps were honored without question for their courage and devotion to 
duty, the prospect of entering their ranks could not be appealing to any gentleman raised up in 
respectable society. 
Yet they sprang from good families, gentlemen’s sons handed over at the age of seven to be raised to the 
life, and it would be an impossible insult to the Corps to have anyone other than one of his own officers 
attempt the harnessing. And if one had to be asked to take the risk, then all; though if Fanshawe had not 
spoken in so unbecoming a way, Laurence would have liked to keep Carver out of it, as he knew the boy 
had a poor head for heights, which struck him as a grave impediment for an aviator. But in the 
atmosphere created by the pitiful request, it would seem like favoritism, and that would not do. 
He took a deep breath, still simmering with anger, and spoke again. “No man here has any training for 
the task, and the only fair means of assigning the duty is by lot. Naturally, those gentlemen with family 
are excused. Mr. Pollitt,” he said, turning to the surgeon, who had a wife and four children in 
Derbyshire, “I hope that you will draw the name for us. Gentlemen, you will each write your name upon 
a sheet here, and cast it into this bag.” He suited word to deed, tore off the part of the sheet with his own 
name, folded it, and put it into the small sack. 
Riley stepped forward at once, and the others followed suit obediently; under Laurence’s cold eye, 
Fanshawe flushed and wrote his name with a shaking hand. Carver, on the other hand, wrote bravely, 
though with a pale cheek; and at the last Battersea, unlike virtually all the others, was incautious in 
tearing the sheet, so that his piece was unusually large; he could be heard murmuring quietly to Carver, 
“Would it not be famous to ride a dragon?” 
Laurence shook his head a little at the thoughtlessness of youth; yet it might indeed be better were one of 
the younger men chosen, for the adjustment would be easier. Still, it would be hard to see one of the 
boys sacrificed to the task, and to face the outrage of his family. But the same would be true of any man 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (9 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:33

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
here, including himself. 
Though he had done his best not to consider the consequences from a selfish perspective, now that the 
fatal moment was at hand he could not entirely suppress his own private fears. One small bit of paper 
might mean the wreck of his career, the upheaval of his life, disgrace in his father’s eyes. And, too, there 
was Edith Galman to think of; but if he were to begin excusing his men for some half-formed 
attachment, not binding, none of them would be left. In any case, he could not imagine excusing himself 
from this selection for any reason: this was not something he could ask his men to face, and avoid 
himself. 
He handed the bag to Mr. Pollitt and made an effort to stand at his ease and appear unconcerned, 
clasping his hands loosely behind his back. The surgeon shook the sack in his hand twice, thrust his 
hand in without looking, and drew out a small folded sheet. Laurence was ashamed to feel a sensation of 
profound relief even before the name was read: the sheet was folded over once more than his own entry 
had been. 
The emotion lasted only a moment. “Jonathan Carver,” Pollitt said. Fanshawe could be heard letting out 
an explosive breath, Battersea sighing, and Laurence bowed his head, silently cursing Fanshawe yet 
again; so promising a young officer, and so likely to be useless in the Corps. 
“Well; there we have it,” he said; there was nothing else to be done. “Mr. Carver, you are relieved of 
regular duty until the hatching; you will instead consult with Mr. Pollitt on the process to follow for the 
harnessing.” 
“Yes, sir,” the boy responded, a little faintly. 
“Dismissed, gentlemen; Mr. Fanshawe, a word with you. Mr. Riley, you have the deck.” 
Riley touched his hat, and the others filed out behind him. Fanshawe stood rigid and pale, hands clasped 
behind his back, and swallowed; his Adam’s apple was prominent and bobbed visibly. Laurence made 
him wait sweating until his steward had restored the cabin furniture, and then seated himself and glared 
at him from this position of state, enthroned before the stern windows. 
“Now then, I should like you to explain precisely what you meant by that remark earlier, Mr. 
Fanshawe,” he said. 
“Oh, sir, I didn’t mean anything,” Fanshawe said. “It is only what they say about aviators, sir—” He 
stumbled to a stop under the increasingly militant gleam in Laurence’s eye. 
“I do not give a damn what they say, Mr. Fanshawe,” he said icily. “England’s aviators are her shield 
from the air, as the Navy is by sea, and when you have done half as much as the least of them, you may 
offer criticism. You will stand Mr. Carver’s watch and do his work as well as your own, and your grog is

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
stopped until further notice: inform the quartermaster. Dismissed.” 
But despite his words, he paced the cabin after Fanshawe had gone. He had been severe, and rightly so, 
for it was very unbecoming in the fellow to speak in such a way, and even more to hint that he might be 
excused for his birth. But it was certainly a sacrifice, and his conscience smote him painfully when he 
thought of the look on Carver’s face. His own continued feelings of relief reproached him; he was 
condemning the boy to a fate he had not wanted to face himself. 
He tried to comfort himself with the notion that there was every chance the dragon would turn its nose 
up at Carver, untrained as he was, and refuse the harness. Then no possible reproach could be made, and 
he could deliver it for the bounty with an easy conscience. Even if it could only be used for breeding, the 
dragon would still do England a great deal of good, and taking it away from the French was a victory all 
on its own; personally he would be more than content with that as a resolution, though as a matter of 
duty he meant to do everything in his power to make the other occur. 
  
The next week passed uncomfortably. It was impossible not to perceive Carver’s anxiety, especially as 
the week wore on and the armorer’s attempt at the harness began to take on a recognizable shape, or the 
unhappiness of his friends and the men of his gun-crew, for he was a popular fellow, and his difficulty 
with heights was no great secret. 
Mr. Pollitt was the only one in good humor, being not very well informed as to the state of the emotions 
on the ship, and very interested in the harnessing process. He spent a great deal of time inspecting the 
egg, going so far as to sleep and eat beside the crate in the gunroom, much to the distress of the officers 
who slept there: his snores were penetrating, and their berth was already crowded. Pollitt was entirely 
unconscious of their silent disapproval, and he kept his vigil until the morning when, with a wretched 
lack of sympathy, he cheerfully announced that the first cracks had begun to show. 
Laurence at once ordered the egg uncrated and brought up on deck. A special cushion had been made for 
it, out of old sailcloth stuffed with straw; this was placed on a couple of lockers lashed together, and the 
egg gingerly laid upon it. Mr. Rabson, the armorer, brought up the harness: it was a makeshift affair of 
leather straps held by dozens of buckles, as he had not known enough about the proportions of dragons 
to make it exact. He stood waiting with it, off to the side, while Carver positioned himself before the 
egg. Laurence ordered the hands to clear the space around the egg to leave more room; most of them 
chose to climb into the rigging or onto the roof of the roundhouse, the better to see the process. 
It was a brilliantly sunny day, and perhaps the warmth and light were encouraging to the long-confined 
hatchling; the egg began to crack more seriously almost as soon as it was laid out. There was a great deal 
of fidgeting and noisy whispering up above, which Laurence chose to ignore, and a few gasps when the 
first glimpse of movement could be seen inside: a clawed wing tip poking out, talons scrabbling out of a 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (11 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:33

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
different crack. 
The end came abruptly: the shell broke almost straight down the middle and the two halves were flung 
apart onto the deck, as if by the occupant’s impatience. The dragonet was left amid bits and pieces, 
shaking itself out vigorously on the pillow. It was still covered with the slime of the interior, and shone 
wet and glossy under the sun; its body was a pure, untinted black from nose to tail, and a sigh of wonder 
ran throughout the crew as it unfurled its large, six-spined wings like a lady’s fan, the bottom edge 
dappled with oval markings in grey and dark glowing blue. 
Laurence himself was impressed; he had never seen a hatchling before, though he had been at several 
fleet actions and witnessed the grown dragons of the Corps striking in support. He did not have the 
knowledge to identify the breed, but it was certainly an exceedingly rare one: he did not recall ever 
seeing a black dragon on either side, and it seemed quite large, for a fresh-hatched creature. That only 
made the matter more urgent. “Mr. Carver, when you are ready,” he said. 
Carver, very pale, stepped towards the creature, holding out his hand, which trembled visibly. “Good 
dragon,” he said; the words sounded rather like a question. “Nice dragon.” 
The dragonet paid him no attention whatsoever. It was occupied in examining itself and picking off bits 
of shell that had adhered to its hide, in a fastidious sort of way. Though it was barely the size of a large 
dog, the five talons upon each claw were still an inch long and impressive; Carver looked at them 
anxiously and stopped an arm’s length away. Here he stood waiting dumbly; the dragon continued to 
ignore him, and presently he cast an anxious look of appeal over his shoulder at where Laurence stood 
with Mr. Pollitt. 
“Perhaps if he were to speak to it again,” Mr. Pollitt said dubiously. 
“Pray do so, Mr. Carver,” Laurence said. 
The boy nodded, but even as he turned back, the dragonet forestalled him by climbing down from its 
cushion and leaping onto the deck past him. Carver turned around with hand still outstretched and an 
almost comical look of surprise, and the other officers, who had drawn closer in the excitement of the 
hatching, backed away in alarm. 
“Hold your positions,” Laurence snapped. “Mr. Riley, look to the hold.” Riley nodded and took up 
position in front of the opening, to prevent the dragonet’s going down below. 
But the dragonet instead turned to exploring the deck; it flicked out a long, narrow forked tongue as it 
walked, lightly touching everything in its reach, and looked about itself with every evidence of curiosity 
and intelligence. Yet it continued to ignore Carver, despite the boy’s repeated attempts to catch its 
attention, and seemed equally uninterested in the other officers. Though it did occasionally rear up onto 
its hind legs to peer at a face more closely, it did as much to examine a pulley, or the hanging hourglass,

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
at which it batted curiously. 
Laurence felt his heart sinking; no one could blame him, precisely, if the dragonet did not show any 
inclination for an untrained sea-officer, but to have a truly rare dragonet caught in the shell go feral 
would certainly feel like a blow. They had arranged the matter from common knowledge, bits and pieces 
out of Pollitt’s books, and from Pollitt’s own imperfect recollection of a hatching which he had once 
observed; now Laurence feared there was some essential step they had missed. It had certainly seemed 
strange to him when he learned that the dragonet should be able to begin talking at once, freshly 
hatched. They had not found anything in the texts describing any specific invitation or trick to induce the 
dragonet to speak, but he should certainly be blamed, and blame himself, if it turned out there had been 
something omitted. 
A low buzz of conversation was spreading as the officers and hands felt the moment passing. Soon he 
would have to give it up and take thought to confining the beast, to keep it from flying off after they fed 
it. Still exploring, the dragon came past him; it sat up on its haunches to look at him inquisitively, and 
Laurence gazed down at it in unconcealed sorrow and dismay. 
It blinked at him; he noticed its eyes were a deep blue and slit-pupiled, and then it said, “Why are you 
frowning?” 
Silence fell at once, and it was only with difficulty that Laurence kept from gaping at the creature. 
Carver, who must have been thinking himself reprieved by now, was standing behind the dragon, mouth 
open; his eyes met Laurence’s with a desperate look, but he drew up his courage and stepped forward, 
ready to address the dragon once more. 
Laurence stared at the dragon, at the pale, frightened boy, and then took a deep breath and said to the 
creature, “I beg your pardon, I did not mean to. My name is Will Laurence; and yours?” 
No discipline could have prevented the murmur of shock which went around the deck. The dragonet did 
not seem to notice, but puzzled at the question for several moments, and finally said, with a dissatisfied 
air, “I do not have a name.” 
Laurence had read over Pollitt’s books enough to know how he should answer; he asked, formally, 
“May I give you one?” 
It—or rather he, for the voice was definitely masculine—looked him over again, paused to scratch at an 
apparently flawless spot on his back, then said with unconvincing indifference, “If you please.” 
And now Laurence found himself completely blank. He had not given any real thought to the process of 
harnessing at all, beyond doing his best to see that it occurred, and he had no idea what an appropriate 
name might be for a dragon. After an awful moment of panic, his mind somehow linked dragon and 
ship, and he blurted out, “Temeraire,” thinking of the noble dreadnought which he had seen launched, 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (13 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:33

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
many years before: that same elegant gliding motion. 
He cursed himself silently for having nothing thought out, but it had been said, and at least it was an 
honorable name; after all, he was a Navy man, and it was only appropriate— But he paused here in his 
own thoughts, and stared at the dragonet in mounting horror: of course he was not a Navy man anymore; 
he could not be, with a dragon, and the moment it accepted the harness from his hands, he would be 
undone. 
The dragon, evidently perceiving nothing of his feelings, said, “Temeraire? Yes. My name is 
Temeraire.” He nodded, an odd gesture with the head bobbing at the end of the long neck, and said more 
urgently, “I am hungry.” 
A newly hatched dragon would fly away immediately after being fed, if not restrained; only if the 
creature might be persuaded to accept the restraint willingly would he ever be controllable, or useful in 
battle. Rabson was standing by gaping and appalled, and had not come forward with the harness; 
Laurence had to beckon him over. His palms were sweating, and the metal and leather felt slippery as 
the man put the harness into his hands. He gripped it tightly and said, remembering at the last moment to 
use the new name, “Temeraire, would you be so good as to let me put this on you? Then we can make 
you fast to the deck here, and bring you something to eat.” 
Temeraire inspected the harness which Laurence held out to him, his flat tongue slipping out to taste it. 
“Very well,” he said, and stood expectantly. Resolutely not thinking beyond the immediate task, 
Laurence knelt and fumbled with the straps and buckles, carefully passing them about the smooth, warm 
body, keeping well clear of the wings. 
The broadest band went around the dragon’s middle, just behind the forelegs, and buckled under the 
belly; this was stitched crosswise to two thick straps which ran along the dragon’s sides and across the 
deep barrel of his chest, then back behind the rear legs and underneath his tail. Various smaller loops 
had been threaded upon the straps, to buckle around the legs and the base of the neck and tail, to keep 
the harness in place, and several narrower and thinner bands strapped across his back. 
The complicated assemblage required some attention, for which Laurence was grateful; he was able to 
lose himself in the task. He noted as he worked that the scales were surprisingly soft to the touch, and it 
occurred to him that the metal edges might bruise. “Mr. Rabson, be so good as to bring me some extra 
sailcloth; we shall wrap these buckles,” he said over his shoulder. 
Shortly it was all done, although the harness and the white-wrapped buckles were ugly against the sleek 
black body, and did not fit very well. But Temeraire made no complaint, nor about having a chain made 
fast from the harness to a stanchion, and he stretched his neck out eagerly to the tub full of steaming red 
meat from the fresh-butchered goat, brought out at Laurence’s command. 
Temeraire was not a clean eater, tearing off large chunks of meat and gulping them down whole,

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
scattering blood and bits of flesh across the deck; he also seemed to enjoy the intestines in particular. 
Laurence stood well clear of the carnage and, having observed in faintly queasy wonder for a few 
moments, was abruptly recalled to the situation by Riley’s uncertain, “Sir, shall I dismiss the officers?” 
He turned and looked at his lieutenant, then at the staring, dismayed midshipmen; no one had spoken or 
moved since the hatching, which, he realized abruptly, had been less than half an hour ago; the hourglass 
was just emptying now. It was difficult to believe; still more difficult to fully acknowledge that he was 
now in harness, but difficult or not, it had to be faced. Laurence supposed he could cling to his rank until 
they reached shore; there were no regulations for a situation such as this one. But if he did, a new 
captain would certainly be put into his place when they reached Madeira, and Riley would never get his 
step up. Laurence would never again be in a position to do him any good. 
“Mr. Riley, the circumstances are awkward, there is no doubt,” he said, steeling himself; he was not 
going to ruin Riley’s career for a cowardly avoidance. “But I think for the sake of the ship, I must put 
her in your hands at once; I will need to devote a great deal of my attention to Temeraire now, and I 
cannot divide it so.” 
“Oh, sir!” Riley said, miserably, but not protesting; evidently the idea had occurred to him as well. But 
his regret was obviously sincere; he had sailed with Laurence for years, and had come up to lieutenant in 
his service from a mere midshipman; they were friends as well as comrades. 
“Let us not be complainers, Tom,” Laurence said more quietly and less formally, giving a warning 
glance to where Temeraire was still glutting himself. Dragon intelligence was a mystery to men who 
made a study of the subject; he had no idea how much the dragon would hear or understand, but thought 
it better to avoid the risk of giving offense. Raising his voice a little more, he added, “I am sure you will 
manage her admirably, Captain.” 
Taking a deep breath, he removed his gold epaulettes; they were pinned on securely, but he had not been 
wealthy when he had first made captain, and he had not forgotten, from those days, how to shift them 
easily from one coat to another. Though perhaps it was not entirely proper to give Riley the symbol of 
rank without confirmation by the Admiralty, Laurence felt it necessary to mark the change of command 
in some visible manner. The left he slipped into his pocket, the right he fixed on Riley’s shoulder: even 
as a captain, Riley could wear only one until he had three years’ seniority. Riley’s fair, freckled skin 
showed every emotion plainly, and he could hardly fail to be happy at this unexpected promotion despite 
the circumstances; he flushed up with color, and looked as though he wished to speak but could not find 
the words. 
“Mr. Wells,” Laurence said, hinting; he meant to do it properly, having begun. 
The third lieutenant started, then said a little weakly, “Huzzah for Captain Riley.” A cheer went up, 
ragged initially, but strong and clear by the third repetition: Riley was a highly competent officer, and 
well liked, even if it was a shocking situation. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (15 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:33

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
When the cheering had died down, Riley, having mastered his embarrassment, added, “And huzzah for—
for Temeraire, lads.” The cheering now was full-throated, if not entirely joyful, and Laurence shook 
Riley’s hand to conclude the matter. 
Temeraire had finished eating by this point, and had climbed up onto a locker by the railing to spread his 
wings in the sun, folding them in and out. But he looked around with interest at hearing his name 
cheered, and Laurence went to his side; it was a good excuse to leave Riley to the business of 
establishing his command, and putting the ship back to rights. “Why are they making that noise?” 
Temeraire asked, but without waiting for an answer, he rattled the chain. “Will you take this off? I 
would like to go flying now.” 
Laurence hesitated; the description of the harnessing ceremony in Mr. Pollitt’s book had provided no 
further instructions beyond getting the dragon into harness and talking; he had somehow assumed that 
the dragon would simply stay where it was without further argument. “If you do not mind, perhaps let us 
leave it awhile longer,” he said, temporizing. “We are rather far from land, you see, and if you were to 
fly off, you might not find your way back.” 
“Oh,” said Temeraire, craning his long neck over the railing; the Reliant was making somewhereabouts 
eight knots in a fine westerly wind, and the water churned away in a white froth from her sides. “Where 
are we?” 
“We are at sea.” Laurence settled down beside him on the locker. “In the Atlantic, perhaps two weeks 
from shore. Masterson,” he added, catching the attention of one of the idle hands who were not-very-
subtly hanging about to gawk. “Be so good as to fetch me a bucket of water and some rags, if you 
please.” 
These being brought, he endeavored to clean away the traces of the messy meal from the glossy black 
hide; Temeraire submitted with evident pleasure to being wiped down, and afterwards appreciatively 
rubbed the side of his head against Laurence’s hand. Laurence found himself smiling involuntarily and 
stroking the warm black hide, and Temeraire settled down, tucked his head into Laurence’s lap, and 
went to sleep. 
“Sir,” Riley said, coming up quietly, “I will leave you the cabin; it would scarcely make sense otherwise, 
with him,” meaning Temeraire. “Shall I have someone help you carry him below now?” 
“Thank you, Tom; and no, I am comfortable enough here for the moment; best not to stir him unless 
necessary, I should think,” Laurence said, then belatedly thought that it might not make it easier on 
Riley, having his former captain sitting on deck. Still, he was not inclined to shift the sleeping dragonet, 
and added only, “If you would be so kind as to have someone bring me a book, perhaps one of Mr. 
Pollitt’s, I should be much obliged,” thinking this would both serve to occupy him, and keep him from 
seeming too much an observer. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (16 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Temeraire did not wake until the sun was slipping below the horizon; Laurence was nodding over his 
book, which described dragon habits in such a way as to make them seem as exciting as plodding cows. 
Temeraire nudged his cheek with a blunt nose to rouse him, and announced, “I am hungry again.” 
Laurence had already begun reassessing the ship’s supply before the hatching; now he had to revise once 
again as he watched Temeraire devour the remainder of the goat and two hastily sacrificed chickens, 
bones and all. So far, in two feedings, the dragonet had consumed his body’s weight in food; he 
appeared already somewhat larger, and he was looking about for more with a wistful air. 
Laurence had a quiet and anxious consultation with Riley and the ship’s cook. If necessary, they could 
hail the Amitié and draw upon her stores: because her complement had been so badly reduced by her 
series of disasters, her supplies of food were more than she would need to make Madeira. However, she 
had been down to salt pork and salt beef, and the Reliant was scarcely better off. At this rate, Temeraire 
should eat up the fresh supplies within a week, and Laurence had no idea if a dragon would eat cured 
meat, or if the salt would perhaps not be good for it. 
“Would he take fish?” the cook suggested. “I have a lovely little tunny, caught fresh this morning, sir; I 
meant it for your dinner. Oh—that is—” He paused, awkwardly, looking back and forth between his 
former captain and his new. 
“By all means let us make the attempt, if you think it right, sir,” Riley said, looking at Laurence and 
ignoring the cook’s confusion. 
“Thank you, Captain,” Laurence said. “We may as well offer it to him; I suppose he can tell us if he 
does not care for it.” 
Temeraire looked at the fish dubiously, then nibbled; shortly the entire thing from head to tail had 
vanished down his throat: it had been a full twelve pounds. He licked his chops and said, “It is very 
crunchy, but I like it well enough,” then startled them and himself by belching loudly. 
“Well,” Laurence said, reaching for the cleaning rag again, “that is certainly encouraging; Captain, if 
you could see your way to putting a few men on fishing duty, perhaps we may preserve the ox for a few 
days more.” 
He took Temeraire down to the cabin afterwards; the ladder presented a bit of a problem, and in the end 
the dragon had to be swung down by an arrangement of pulleys attached to his harness. Temeraire nosed 
around the desk and chair inquisitively, and poked his head out of the windows to look at the Reliant’s 
wake. The pillow from the hatching had been placed into a double-wide hanging cot for him, slung next 
to Laurence’s own, and he leapt easily into it from the ground. 
His eyes almost immediately closed to drowsy slits. Thus relieved of duty and no longer under the eyes 
of the crew, Laurence sat down with a thump in his chair and stared at the sleeping dragon, as at an 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (17 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
instrument of doom. 
He had two brothers and three nephews standing between himself and his father’s estate, and his own 
capital was invested in the Funds, requiring no great management on his part; that at least would not be a 
matter of difficulty. He had gone over the rails a score of times in battle, and he could stand in the tops 
in a gale without a bit of queasiness: he did not fear he would prove shy aboard a dragon. 
But for the rest—he was a gentleman and a gentleman’s son. Though he had gone to sea at the age of 
twelve, he had been fortunate enough to serve aboard first- or second-rate ships-of-the-line for the most 
part of his service, under wealthy captains who kept fine tables and entertained their officers regularly. 
He dearly loved society; conversation, dancing, and friendly whist were his favorite pursuits; and when 
he thought that he might never go to the opera again, he felt a very palpable urge to tip the laden cot out 
the windows. 
He tried not to hear his father’s voice in his head, condemning him for a fool; tried not to imagine what 
Edith would think when she heard of it. He could not even write to let her know. Although he had to 
some extent considered himself committed, no formal engagement had ever been entered upon, due first 
to his lack of capital and more recently to his long absence from England. 
He had done sufficiently well in the way of prize-money to do away with the first problem, and if he had 
been set ashore for any length of time in the last four years, he most likely would have spoken. He had 
been half in mind to request a brief leave for England at the end of this cruise; it was hard to deliberately 
put himself ashore when he could not rely upon getting another ship afterwards, but he was not so 
eligible a prospect that he imagined she would wait for him over all other suitors on the strength of a 
half-joking agreement between a thirteen-year-old boy and a nine-year-old girl. 
Now he was a poorer prospect indeed; he had not the slightest notion how and where he might live as an 
aviator, or what sort of a home he could offer a wife. Her family might object, even if she herself did 
not; certainly it was nothing she had been led to expect. A Navy wife might have to face with 
equanimity her husband’s frequent absences, but when he appeared she did not have to uproot herself 
and go live in some remote covert, with a dragon outside the door and a crowd of rough men the only 
society. 
He had always entertained a certain private longing for a home of his own, imagined in detail through 
the long, lonely nights at sea: smaller by necessity than the one in which he had been raised, yet still 
elegant; kept by a wife whom he could trust with the management of their affairs and their children both; 
a comfortable refuge when he was at home, and a warm memory while at sea. 
Every feeling protested against the sacrifice of this dream; yet under the circumstances, he was not even 
sure he could honorably make Edith an offer which she might feel obliged to accept. And there was no 
question of courting someone else in her place; no woman of sense and character would deliberately 
engage her affections on an aviator, unless she was of the sort who preferred to have a complacent and

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
absent husband leaving his purse in her hands, and to live apart from him even while he was in England; 
such an arrangement did not appeal to Laurence in the slightest. 
The sleeping dragon, swaying back and forth in his cot, tail twitching unconsciously in time with some 
alien dream, was a very poor substitute for hearth and home. Laurence stood and went to the stern 
windows, looking over the Reliant’s wake, a pale and opalescent froth streaming out behind her in the 
light from the lanterns; the ebb and flow was pleasantly numbing to watch. 
His steward Giles brought in his dinner with a great clatter of plate and silver, keeping well back from 
the dragon’s cot. His hands trembled as he laid out the service; Laurence dismissed him once the meal 
was served and sighed a little when he had gone; he had thought of asking Giles to come along with him, 
as he supposed even an aviator might have a servant, but there was no use if the man was spooked by the 
creatures. It would have been something to have a familiar face. 
In solitude, he ate his simple dinner quickly; it was only salt beef with a little glazing of wine, as the fish 
had gone into Temeraire’s belly, and he had little appetite in any case. He tried to write some letters, 
afterwards, but it was no use; his mind would wander back into gloomy paths, and he had to force his 
attention to every line. At last he gave it up, looked out briefly to tell Giles he would take no supper this 
evening, and climbed into his own cot. Temeraire shifted and snuggled deeper within the bedding; after 
a brief struggle with uncharitable resentment, Laurence reached out and covered him more securely, the 
night air being somewhat cool, and then fell asleep to the sound of the dragon’s regular deep breathing, 
like the heaving of a bellows. 
  
Chapter 2 
 
THE NEXT MORNING, Laurence woke when Temeraire proceeded to envelop himself in his cot, which 
turned round twice as he tried to climb down. Laurence had to unhook it to disentangle him, and he burst 
out of the unwound fabric in hissing indignation. He had to be groomed and petted back into temper, 
like an affronted cat, and then he was at once hungry again. 
Fortunately, it was not very early, and the hands had met with some luck fishing, so there were still eggs 
for his own breakfast, the hens being spared another day, and a forty-pound tunny for the dragon’s. 
Temeraire somehow managed to devour the entire thing and then was too heavy to get back into his cot, 
so he simply dropped in a distended heap upon the floor and slept there. 
The rest of the first week passed similarly: Temeraire was asleep except when he was eating, and he ate 
and grew alarmingly. By the end of it, he was no longer staying below, because Laurence had grown to 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (19 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
fear that it would become impossible to get him out of the ship: he had already grown heavier than a cart-
horse, and longer from tip to tail than the launch. After consideration of his future growth, they decided 
to shift stores to leave the ship heavier forward and place him upon the deck towards the stern as a 
counterbalance. 
The change was made just in time: Temeraire only barely managed to squeeze back out of the cabin with 
his wings furled tightly, and he grew another foot in diameter overnight by Mr. Pollitt’s measurements. 
Fortunately, when he lay astern his bulk was not greatly in the way, and there he slept for the better part 
of each day, tail twitching occasionally, hardly stirring even when the hands were forced to clamber over 
him to do their work. 
At night, Laurence slept on deck beside him, feeling it his place; as the weather held fair, it cost him no 
great pains. He was increasingly worried about food; the ox would have to be slaughtered in a day or so, 
with all the fishing they could do. At this rate of increase in his appetite, even if Temeraire proved 
willing to accept cured meat, he might exhaust their supplies before they reached shore. It would be very 
difficult, he felt, to put a dragon on short commons, and in any case it would put the crew on edge; 
though Temeraire was harnessed and might be in theory tame, even in these days a feral dragon, escaped 
from the breeding grounds, could and occasionally would eat a man if nothing more appetizing offered; 
and from the uneasy looks no one had forgotten it. 
When the first change in the air came, midway through the second week, Laurence felt the alteration 
unconsciously and woke near dawn, some hours before the rain began to fall. The lights of the Amitié 
were nowhere to be seen: the ships had drawn apart during the night, under the increasing wind. The sky 
grew only a little lighter, and presently the first thick drops began to patter against the sails. 
Laurence knew that he could do nothing; Riley must command now, if ever, and so Laurence set himself 
to keeping Temeraire quiet and no distraction to the men. This proved difficult, for the dragon was very 
curious about the rain, and kept spreading his wings to feel the water beating upon them. 
Thunder did not frighten him, nor lightning; “What makes it?” he only asked, and was disappointed 
when Laurence could offer him no answer. “We could go and see,” he suggested, partly unfolding his 
wings again, and taking a step towards the stern railing. Laurence started with alarm; Temeraire had 
made no further attempts to fly since the first day, being more preoccupied with eating, and though they 
had enlarged the harness three times, they had never exchanged the chain for a heavier one. Now he 
could see the iron links straining and beginning to come open, though Temeraire was barely exerting any 
pull upon it. 
“Not now, Temeraire, we must let the others work, and watch from here,” he said, gripping the nearest 
side-strap of the harness and thrusting his left arm through it; though he realized now, too late, that his 
weight would no longer be an impediment, at least if they went aloft together, he might be able to 
persuade the dragon to come back down eventually. Or he might fall; but that thought he pushed from 
his mind as quickly as it came.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Thankfully, Temeraire settled again, if regretfully, and returned to watching the sky. Laurence looked 
about with a faint idea of calling for a stronger chain, but the crew were all occupied, and he could not 
interrupt. In any case, he wondered if there were any on board that would serve as more than an 
annoyance; he was abruptly aware that Temeraire’s shoulder topped his head by nearly a foot, and that 
the foreleg which had once been as delicate as a lady’s wrist was now thicker around than his thigh. 
Riley was shouting through the speaking-trumpet to issue his orders. Laurence did his best not to listen; 
he could not intervene, and it could only be unpleasant to hear an order he did not like. The men had 
already been through one nasty gale as a crew and knew their work; fortunately the wind was not 
contrary, so they might go scudding before the gale, and the topgallant masts had already been struck 
down properly. So far all was well, and they were keeping roughly on their eastern heading, but behind 
them an opaque curtain of whirling rain blotted out the world, and it was outpacing the Reliant. 
The wall of water crashed upon the deck with the sound of gunfire, soaking him through to the skin 
immediately despite his oilskin and sou’wester. Temeraire snorted and shook his head like a dog, 
sending water flying, and ducked down beneath his own hastily opened wings, which he curled about 
himself. Laurence, still tucked up against his side and holding to the harness, found himself also 
sheltered by the living dome. It was exceedingly strange to be so snug in the heart of a raging storm; he 
could still see out through the places where the wings did not overlap, and a cool spray came in upon his 
face. 
“That man who brought me the shark is in the water,” Temeraire said presently, and Laurence followed 
his line of sight; through the nearly solid mass of rain he could see a blur of red-and-white shirt some six 
points abaft the larboard beam, and something like an arm waving: Gordon, one of the hands who had 
been helping with the fishing. 
“Man overboard,” he shouted, cupping his hands around his mouth to make it carry, and pointed out to 
the struggling figure in the waves. Riley gave one anguished look; a few ropes were thrown, but already 
the man was too far back; the storm was blowing them before it, and there was no chance of retrieving 
him with the boats. 
“He is too far from those ropes,” Temeraire said. “I will go and get him.” 
Laurence was in the air and dangling before he could object, the broken chain swinging free from 
Temeraire’s neck beside him. He seized it with his loose arm as it came close and wrapped it around the 
straps of the harness a few times to keep it from flailing and striking Temeraire’s side like a whip; then 
he clung grimly and tried only to keep his head, while his legs hung out over empty air with nothing but 
the ocean waiting below to receive him if he should lose his grip. 
Instinct had sufficed to get them aloft, but it might not be adequate to keep them there; Temeraire was 
being forced to the east of the ship. He kept trying to fight the wind head-on; there was a hideous 
dizzying moment where they went tumbling before a sharp gust, and Laurence thought for an instant that

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
they were lost and would be dashed into the waves. 
“With the wind,” he roared with every ounce of breath developed over eighteen years at sea, hoping 
Temeraire could hear him. “Go with the wind, damn you!” 
The muscles beneath his cheek strained, and Temeraire righted himself, turning eastwards. Abruptly the 
rain stopped beating upon Laurence’s face: they were flying with the wind, going at an enormous rate. 
He gasped for breath, tears whipping away from his eyes with the speed; he had to close them. It was as 
far beyond standing in the tops at ten knots as that experience was beyond standing in a field on a hot, 
still day. There was a reckless laughter trying to bubble out of his throat, like a boy’s, and he only barely 
managed to stifle it and think sanely. 
“We cannot come straight at him,” he called. “You must tack—you must go to north, then south, 
Temeraire, do you understand?” 
If the dragon answered, the wind took the reply, but he seemed to have grasped the idea. He dropped 
abruptly, angling northwards with his wings cupping the wind; Laurence’s stomach dived as on a 
rowboat in a heavy swell. The rain and wind still battered them, but not so badly as before, and 
Temeraire came about and changed tacks as sweetly as a fine cutter, zigzagging through the air and 
making gradual progress back in a westerly direction. 
Laurence’s arms were burning; he thrust his left arm through the breast-band against losing his grip, and 
unwound his right hand to give it a respite. As they drew even with and then passed the ship, he could 
just see Gordon still struggling in the distance; fortunately the man could swim a little, and despite the 
fury of the rain and wind, the swell was not so great as to drag him under. Laurence looked at 
Temeraire’s claws dubiously; with the enormous talons, if the dragon were to snatch Gordon up, the 
maneuver might as easily kill the man as save him. Laurence would have to put himself into position to 
catch Gordon. 
“Temeraire, I will pick him up; wait until I am ready, then go as low as you can,” he called; then he 
lowered himself down the harness slowly and carefully to hang down from the belly, keeping one arm 
hooked through a strap at every stage. It was a terrifying progress, but once he was below, matters 
became easier, as Temeraire’s body shielded him from the rain and wind. He pulled on the broad strap 
which ran around Temeraire’s middle; there was perhaps just enough give. One at a time he worked his 
legs between the leather and Temeraire’s belly, so he might have both his hands free, then slapped the 
dragon’s side. 
Temeraire stooped abruptly, like a diving hawk. Laurence let himself dangle down, trusting to the 
dragon’s aim, and his fingers made furrows in the surface of the water for a couple of yards before they 
hit sodden cloth and flesh. He blindly clutched at the feel, and Gordon grabbed at him in turn. Temeraire 
was lifting back up and away, wings beating furiously, but thankfully they could now go with the wind 
instead of fighting it. Gordon’s weight dragged on Laurence’s arms, shoulders, thighs, every muscle

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
straining; the band was so tight upon his calves that he could no longer feel his legs below the knee, and 
he had the uncomfortable sensation of all the blood in his body rushing straight into his head. They 
swung heavily back and forth like a pendulum as Temeraire arrowed back towards the ship, and the 
world tilted crazily around him. 
They dropped onto the deck ungracefully, rocking the ship. Temeraire stood wavering on his hind legs, 
trying at the same time to fold his wings out of the wind and keep his balance with the two of them 
dragging him downwards from the belly-strap. Gordon let go and scrambled away in panic, leaving 
Laurence to extract himself while Temeraire seemed about to fall over upon him at any moment. His 
stiff fingers refused to work on the buckles, and abruptly Wells was there with a knife flashing, cutting 
through the strap. 
His legs thumped heavily to the deck, blood rushing back into them; Temeraire similarly dropped down 
to all fours again beside him, the impact sending a tremor through the deck. Laurence lay flat on his 
back and panted, for the moment not caring that rain was beating full upon him; his muscles would obey 
no command. Wells hesitated; Laurence waved him back to his work and struggled back onto his legs; 
they held him up, and the pain of the returning sensation eased as he forced them to move. 
The gale was still blowing around them, but the ship was now set to rights, scudding before the wind 
under close-reefed topsails, and there was less of a feel of crisis upon the deck. Turning away from 
Riley’s handiwork with a sense of mingled pride and regret, Laurence coaxed Temeraire to shift back 
towards the center of the stern where his weight would not unbalance the ship. It was barely in time; as 
soon as Temeraire settled down once again, he yawned enormously and tucked his head down beneath 
his wing, ready to sleep for once without making his usual demand for food. Laurence slowly lowered 
himself to the deck and leaned against the dragon’s side; his body still ached profoundly from the strain. 
He roused himself for only a moment longer; he felt the need to speak, though his tongue felt thick and 
stupid with fatigue. “Temeraire,” he said, “that was well done. Very bravely done.” 
Temeraire brought his head out and gazed at him, eye-slits widening to ovals. “Oh,” he said, sounding a 
little uncertain. Laurence realized with a brief stab of guilt that he had scarcely given the dragonet a kind 
word before this. The convulsion of his life might be the creature’s fault, in some sense, but Temeraire 
was only obeying his nature, and to make the beast suffer for it was hardly noble. 
But he was too tired at the moment to make better amends than to repeat, lamely, “Very well done,” and 
pat the smooth black side. Yet it seemed to serve; Temeraire said nothing more, but he shifted himself a 
little and tentatively curled up around Laurence, partly unfurling a wing to shield him from the rain. The 
fury of the storm was muffled beneath the canopy, and Laurence could feel the great heartbeat against 
his cheek; he was warmed through in moments by the steady heat of the dragon’s body, and thus 
sheltered he slid abruptly and completely into sleep.

“Are you quite sure it is secure?” Riley asked anxiously. “Sir, I am sure we could put together a net, 
perhaps you had better not.” 
Laurence shifted his weight and pulled against the straps wrapped snugly around his thighs and calves; 
they did not give, nor did the main part of the harness, and he remained stable in his perch atop 
Temeraire’s back, just behind the wings. “No, Tom, it won’t do, and you know it; this is not a fishing-
boat, and you cannot spare the men. We might very well meet a Frenchman one of these days, and then 
where would we be?” He leaned forward and patted Temeraire’s neck; the dragon’s head was doubled 
back, observing the proceedings with interest. 
“Are you ready? May we go now?” he asked, putting a forehand on the railing. Muscles were already 
gathering beneath the smooth hide, and there was a palpable impatience in his voice. 
“Stand clear, Tom,” Laurence said hastily, casting off the chain and taking hold of the neck-strap. “Very 
well, Temeraire, let us—” A single leap, and they were airborne, the broad wings thrusting in great 
sweeping arcs to either side of him, the whole long body stretched out like an arrow driving upwards 
into the sky. He looked downwards over Temeraire’s shoulder; already the Reliant was shrinking to a 
child’s toy, bobbing lonely in the vast expanse of the ocean; he could even see the Amitié perhaps twenty 
miles to the east. The wind was enormous, but the straps were holding, and he was grinning idiotically 
again, he realized, unable to prevent himself. 
“We will keep to the west, Temeraire,” Laurence called; he did not want to run the risk of getting too 
close to land and possibly encountering a French patrol. They had put a band around the narrow part of 
Temeraire’s neck beneath the head and attached reins to this, so Laurence might more easily give 
Temeraire direction; now he consulted the compass he had strapped into his palm and tugged on the 
right rein. The dragon pulled out of his climb and turned willingly, leveling out. The day was clear, 
without clouds, and a moderate swell only; Temeraire’s wings beat less rapidly now they were no longer 
going up, but even so the pace was devouring the miles: the Reliant and the Amitié were already out of 
sight. 
“Oh, I see one,” Temeraire said, and they were plummeting down with even more speed. Laurence 
gripped the reins tightly and swallowed a yell; it was absurd to feel so childishly gleeful. The distance 
gave him some more idea of the dragon’s eyesight: it would have to be prodigious to allow him to sight 
prey at such a range. He had barely time for the thought, then there was a tremendous splash, and 
Temeraire was lifting back away with a porpoise struggling in his claws and streaming water. 
Another astonishment: Temeraire stopped and hovered in place to eat, his wings beating perpendicular 
to his body in swiveling arcs; Laurence had had no idea that dragons could perform such a maneuver. It 
was not comfortable, as Temeraire’s control was not very precise and he bobbed up and down wildly, 
but it proved very practical, for as he scattered bits of entrails onto the ocean below, other fish began to 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (24 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
rise to the surface to feed on the discards, and when he had finished with the porpoise he at once 
snatched up two large tunnys, one in each forehand, and ate these as well, and then an immense 
swordfish also. 
Having tucked his arm under the neck-strap to keep himself from being flung about, Laurence was free 
to look around himself and consider the sensation of being master of the entire ocean, for there was not 
another creature or vessel in sight. He could not help but feel pride in the success of the operation, and 
the thrill of flying was extraordinary: so long as he could enjoy it without thinking of all it was to cost 
him, he could be perfectly happy. 
Temeraire swallowed the last bite of the swordfish and discarded the sharp upper jaw after inspecting it 
curiously. “I am full,” he said, beating back upwards into the sky. “Shall we go and fly some more?” 
It was a tempting suggestion; but they had been aloft more than an hour, and Laurence was not yet sure 
of Temeraire’s endurance. He regretfully said, “Let us go back to the Reliant, and if you like we may fly 
a bit more about her.” 
And then racing across the ocean, low to the waves now, with Temeraire snatching at them playfully 
every now and again; the spray misting his face and the world rushing by in a blur, but for the constant 
solid presence of the dragon beneath him. He gulped deep draughts of the salt air and lost himself in 
simple enjoyment, only pausing every once and again to tug the reins after consulting his compass, and 
bringing them at last back to the Reliant. 
Temeraire said he was ready to sleep again after all, so they made a landing; this time it was a more 
graceful affair, and the ship did not bounce so much as settle slightly lower in the water. Laurence 
unstrapped his legs and climbed down, surprised to find himself a little saddle-sore; but he at once 
realized that this was only to be expected. Riley was hurrying back to meet them, relief written clearly 
on his face, and Laurence nodded to him reassuringly. 
“No need to worry; he did splendidly, and I think you need not worry about his meals in future: we will 
manage very well,” he said, stroking the dragon’s side; Temeraire, already drowsing, opened one eye 
and made a pleased rumbling noise, then closed it again. 
“I am very glad to hear it,” Riley said, “and not least because that means our dinner for you tonight will 
be respectable: we took the precaution of continuing our efforts in your absence, and we have a very fine 
turbot which we may now keep for ourselves. With your consent, perhaps I will invite some members of 
the gunroom to join us.” 
“With all my heart; I look forward to it,” Laurence said, stretching to relieve the stiffness in his legs. He 
had insisted on surrendering the main cabin once Temeraire had been shifted to the deck; Riley had at 
last acquiesced, but he compensated for his guilt at displacing his former captain by inviting Laurence to 
dine with him virtually every night. This practice had been interrupted by the gale, but that having blown 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (25 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
itself out the night before, they meant to resume this evening. 
It was a good meal and a merry one, particularly once the bottle had gone round a few times and the 
younger midshipmen had drunk enough to lose their wooden manners. Laurence had the happy gift of 
easy conversation, and his table had always been a cheerful place for his officers; to help matters along 
further, he and Riley were fast approaching a true friendship now that the barrier of rank had been 
removed. 
The gathering thus had an almost informal flavor to it, so that when Carver found himself the only one at 
liberty, having devoured his pudding a little more quickly than his elders, he dared to address Laurence 
directly, and tentatively said, “Sir, if I may be so bold as to ask, is it true that dragons can breathe fire?” 
Laurence, pleasantly full of plum duff topped by several glasses of a fine Riesling, received the question 
tolerantly. “That depends upon the breed, Mr. Carver,” he answered, putting down his glass. “However, 
I think the ability extremely rare. I have only ever seen it once myself: in a Turkish dragon at the battle 
of the Nile, and I was damned glad the Turks had taken our part when I saw it work, I can tell you.” 
The other officers shuddered all around and nodded; few things were as deadly to a ship as uncontrolled 
fire upon her deck. “I was on the Goliath myself,” Laurence went on. “We were not half a mile distant 
from the Orient when she went up, like a torch; we had shot out her deck-guns and mostly cleared her 
sharpshooters from the tops, so the dragon could strafe her at will.” He fell silent, remembering: the sails 
all ablaze and trailing thick plumes of black smoke; the great orange-and-black beast diving down and 
pouring still more fire from its jaws upon them, its wings fanning the flames; the terrible roaring which 
was only drowned out at last by the explosion, and the way all sound had been muted for nearly a day 
thereafter. He had been in Rome once as a boy, and there seen in the Vatican a painting of Hell by 
Michelangelo, with dragons roasting the damned souls with fire; it had been very like. 
There was a general moment of silence, imagination drawing the scene for those who had not been 
present. Mr. Pollitt cleared his throat and said, “Fortunately, I believe that the ability to spit poison is 
more common among them, or acid; not that those are not formidable weapons in their own right.” 
“Lord, yes,” Wells said, to this. “I have seen dragon-spray eat away an entire mainsail in under a minute. 
But still, it will not set fire to a magazine and make your ship burst into flinders under you.” 
“Will Temeraire be able to do that?” Battersea asked, a little round-eyed at these stories, and Laurence 
started; he was sitting at Riley’s right hand, just as if he had been invited to the gunroom for dinner, and 
for a moment he had almost forgotten that instead he was a guest in his former cabin, and upon his 
former ship. 
Fortunately, Mr. Pollitt answered, so Laurence could take a moment to cover his confusion. “As his 
breed is not one of those described in my books, we must wait for the answer until we reach land and 
can have him properly identified; even if he is of the appropriate kind, most likely there would be no 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (26 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
manifestation of such an ability until he has his full growth, which will not be for some months to 
come.” 
“Thank heavens,” Riley said, to a general round of laughing agreement, and Laurence managed to smile 
and raise a glass in Temeraire’s honor with the rest of the table. 
Afterwards, having said his good nights in the cabin, Laurence walked a little unsteadily back towards 
the stern, where Temeraire lay in solitary splendor, the crew having mostly abandoned that part of the 
deck to him as he had grown. He opened a gleaming eye as Laurence approached and lifted a wing in 
invitation. Laurence was a little surprised at the gesture, but he took up his pallet and ducked under into 
the comfortable warmth. He unrolled the pallet and sat down upon it, leaning back against the dragon’s 
side, and Temeraire lowered the wing again, making a warm sheltered space around him. 
“Do you think I will be able to breathe fire or spit poison?” Temeraire asked. “I am not sure how I could 
tell; I tried, but I only blew air.” 
“Did you hear us talking?” Laurence asked, startled; the stern windows had been open, and the 
conversation might well have been audible on deck, but somehow it had not occurred to him that 
Temeraire might listen. 
“Yes,” Temeraire said. “The part about the battle was very exciting. Have you been in many of them?” 
“Oh, I suppose so,” Laurence said. “Not more than many other fellows.” This was not entirely true; he 
had an unusually large number of actions to his credit, which had seen him to the post-list at a relatively 
young age, and he was accounted a fighting-captain. “But that is how we found you, when you were in 
the egg; you were aboard the prize when we took her,” he added, indicating the Amitié, her stern lanterns 
presently visible two points to larboard. 
Temeraire looked out at her with interest. “You won me in a battle? I did not know that.” He sounded 
pleased by the information. “Will we be in another one soon? I would like to see. I am sure I could help, 
even if I cannot breathe fire yet.” 
Laurence smiled at his enthusiasm; dragons notoriously had a great deal of fighting spirit, part of what 
made them so valuable in war. “Most likely not before we put into port, but I dare say we will see 
enough of them after; England does not have many dragons, so we will most likely be called on a great 
deal, once you are grown,” he said. 
He looked up at Temeraire’s head, presently raised up to gaze out to sea. Relieved of the pressing 
concern of feeding him, Laurence could give thought now to the other meaning of all that strength 
behind his back. Temeraire was already larger than some full-grown dragons of other breeds, and, in his 
inexperienced judgment, very fast. He would indeed be invaluable to the Corps and to England, fire-
breath or no. It was not without pride that he thought to himself there was no fear Temeraire would ever 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (27 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
prove shy; if he had a difficult duty ahead of him, he could hardly have asked for a worthier partner. 
“Will you tell me some more of the battle of the Nile?” Temeraire said, looking down. “Was it just your 
ship and the other one, and the dragon?” 
“Lord, no, there were thirteen ships-of-the-line for our side, with eight dragons from the Third Division 
of the Aerial Corps in support, and another four dragons from the Turks,” Laurence said. “The French 
had seventeen and fourteen for their part, so we were outnumbered, but Admiral Nelson’s strategy left 
them wholly taken aback,” and as he continued, Temeraire lowered his head and curled more closely 
about him, listening with his great eyes shining in the darkness, and so they talked quietly together, long 
into the night. 
  
Chapter 3 
 
THEY ARRIVED AT Funchal a day short of Laurence’s original three-week estimate, having been sped 
along their way by the gale, with Temeraire sitting up in the stern and eagerly watching from the 
moment the island had come into view. He caused something of an immediate sensation on land, 
dragons not ordinarily to be seen riding into harbor upon small frigates, and there was a small crowd of 
spectators gathered upon the docks as they came into port, although by no means coming very close to 
the vessel. 
Admiral Croft’s flagship was in port; the Reliant was nominally sailing under his command, and Riley 
and Laurence had privately agreed that the two of them should report together to acquaint him with the 
unusual situation. The signal Captain report aboard flag went up on the Commendable almost the 
instant they had dropped anchor, and Laurence paused for only a moment to speak with Temeraire. 
“You must remain aboard until I return, remember,” he said, anxiously, for while Temeraire was never 
willfully disobliging, he was easily distracted by anything new and of interest, and Laurence did not 
have a great deal of confidence in his restraint while surrounded by so much of a new world to explore. 
“I promise you we shall fly over the whole island when I come back; you shall see all you like, and in 
the meantime Mr. Wells will bring you a nice fresh veal and some lamb, which you have never had.” 
Temeraire sighed a little, but inclined his head. “Very well, but do hurry,” he said. “I would like to go up 
to those mountains. And I could just eat those,” he added, looking at a team of carriage horses standing 
nearby; the horses stamped nervously as though they had heard and understood perfectly well. 
“Oh, no, Temeraire, you cannot just eat anything you see on the streets,” Laurence said in alarm. “Wells 
will bring you something straightaway.” Turning, he caught the third lieutenant’s eye, and conveyed the

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
urgency of the situation; then with a final dubious glance, he went down the gangplank and joined Riley. 
Admiral Croft was waiting for them impatiently; he had evidently heard something of the fuss. He was a 
tall man and a striking one, the more so for a raking scar across his face and the false hand which was 
attached to the stump of his left arm, its iron fingers operated by springs and catches. He had lost the 
limb shortly before his promotion to flag rank, and since had put on a great deal of weight; he did not 
rise when they came into his stateroom, but only scowled a little and waved them to chairs. “Very well, 
Laurence, explain yourself; I suppose this has something to do with the feral you have down there?” 
“Sir, that is Temeraire; he is not feral,” Laurence said. “We took a French ship, the Amitié, three weeks 
ago yesterday; we found his egg in their hold. Our surgeon had some knowledge of dragonkind; he 
warned us that it would hatch shortly, and so we were able to arrange—that is to say, I harnessed him.” 
Croft sat up abruptly and squinted at Laurence, then at Riley, only then taking notice of the change in 
uniform. “What, yourself? And so you— Good Lord, why didn’t you put one of your midshipmen to the 
thing?” he demanded. “This is taking duty a little far, Laurence; a fine thing when a naval officer 
chooses to jump ship for the Corps.” 
“Sir, my officers and I drew lots,” Laurence said, suppressing a flare of indignation; he had not desired 
to be lauded for his sacrifice, but it was a little much to be upbraided for it. “I hope no one would ever 
question my devotion to the service; I felt it only fair to them that I should share the risk, and in the 
event, though I did not draw the lot, there was no avoiding it; he took a liking to me, and we could not 
risk him refusing the harness from another hand.” 
“Oh, hell,” Croft said, and relapsed into his chair with a sullen expression, tapping the fingers of his 
right hand against the metal palm of the left, a nervous gesture, and sat silently except for the small 
clinking noise which his fingernails made upon the iron. The minutes dragged, while Laurence 
alternated between imagining a thousand disasters which Temeraire might precipitate in his absence, and 
worrying what Croft might do with the Reliant and Riley. 
At last Croft started, as if waking up, and waved his good hand. “Well, there must be some sort of 
bounty; they can hardly give less for a harnessed creature than a feral one, after all,” he said. “The 
French frigate, a man-of-war, I suppose, no merchantman? Well, she looks likely enough, I am sure she 
will be brought into the service,” he added, good humor apparently restored, and Laurence realized with 
mingled relief and irritation that the man had only been calculating his admiral’s share in his head. 
“Indeed, sir, she is a very trim craft; thirty-six guns,” he said politely, keeping several other things which 
he might have said to himself; he would never have to report to this man again, but Riley’s future still 
hung in the balance. 
“Hm. You have done as you ought, Laurence, I am sure; though it is a pity to lose you. I suppose you 
shall like to be an aviator,” Croft said, in tones that made it quite plain he supposed no such thing. “We

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
have no division of the Corps locally, though; even the dispatch-carrier only comes through once a 
week. You will have to take him to Gibraltar, I imagine.” 
“Yes, sir, though the trip must wait until he has more growth; he can stay aloft for an hour or so without 
much trouble, but I do not like to risk him on a long flight just yet,” Laurence said firmly. “And in the 
meantime, he must be fed; we have only managed to get by so long with fishing, but of course he cannot 
hunt here.” 
“Well, Laurence, that is no lookout of the Navy’s, I am sure,” Croft said, but before Laurence could be 
really taken aback by this petty remark, the man seemed to realize how ill it sounded, and amended his 
words. “However, I will speak to the governor; I am sure we can arrange something. Now then, the 
Reliant, and of course the Amitié, we must take some thought for them.” 
“I should like to point out that Mr. Riley has been in command of the Reliant since the harnessing, and 
that he has handled her exceptionally well, bringing her safely to port through a two-days’ gale,” 
Laurence said. “He fought very bravely in the action which won us the prize, as well.” 
“Oh, I am sure, I am sure,” Croft said, turning his finger in circles again. “Who do you have in the 
Amitié?” 
“My first lieutenant, Gibbs,” Laurence said. 
“Yes, of course,” Croft said. “Well, it is a bit much of you to hope to make both your first and second 
lieutenants post in such a way, Laurence, you must see that. There are not so many fine frigates out 
there.” 
Laurence had great difficulty in keeping his countenance; the man was clearly looking for some excuse 
to give himself a plum to deal out to one of his own favorites. “Sir,” he said, icily, “I do not quite take 
your meaning; I hope you are not suggesting that I had myself put in harness in order to open a vacancy. 
I assure you my only motive was to secure to England a very valuable dragon, and I would hope that 
their Lordships will see it in such a way.” 
It was as close as he would come to harping on his own sacrifice, and a good deal closer than he would 
have preferred to come, without Riley’s welfare at stake. But it had its effect; Croft seemed struck by the 
reminder, and the mention of the Admiralty; at least he hemmed and hawed and retreated, and dismissed 
them without saying anything final about removing Riley from command. 
“Sir, I am deeply indebted to you,” Riley said, as they walked together back towards the ship. “I only 
hope you will not have caused difficulties for yourself by pressing the matter so; I suppose he must have 
a great deal of influence.” 
Laurence at the moment had little room for any emotion but relief, for they had come to their own dock,

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
and Temeraire was still sitting on the deck of the ship; although that looked more like an abattoir at the 
moment, and the area around his chops more red than black. The crowd of spectators had entirely 
dispersed. “If there is any blessing to the whole business, Tom, it is that I no longer need to give much 
thought to influence; I do not suppose it can make any difference to an aviator,” he answered. “Pray 
have no concern for me. Should you mind if we were to walk a little faster? I think he has finished 
eating.” 
  
Flying did a great deal more to soothe his ruffled temper; it was impossible to be angry with the whole 
island of Madeira spread out before him and the wind in his hair, and Temeraire excitedly pointing out 
new things of interest, such as animals, houses, carts, trees, rocks, and anything else which might catch 
his eye; he had lately worked out a method of flying with his head partly turned round, so that he might 
talk to Laurence even while they flew. By mutual agreement, he perched at last upon an empty road that 
ran along at the edge of a deep valley; a bank of clouds was rolling thickly down the green southern 
slopes, clinging to the ground in a peculiar way, and he sat to watch their movement in fascination. 
Laurence dismounted; he was still growing used to riding and was glad to stretch his legs after an hour 
in the air. He walked about for a while now, enjoying the view, and thought to himself that the next 
morning he would bring something to eat and drink on their flight; he would rather have liked a 
sandwich, and a glass of wine. 
“I would like another one of those lambs,” Temeraire said, echoing his own thoughts. “They were very 
tasty. Can I eat those over there? They look even larger.” 
There was a handsome flock of sheep grazing placidly on the far side of the valley, white against the 
green. “No, Temeraire; those are sheep, mutton,” Laurence said. “They are not as good, and I think they 
must be someone’s property, so we cannot go snatching them. But perhaps I will see if I cannot arrange 
for the shepherd to set one aside for you for tomorrow, if you would like to come back here.” 
“It seems very strange that the ocean is full of things that one can eat as one likes, and on land 
everything seems to be spoken for,” Temeraire said, disappointed. “It does not seem quite right; they are 
not eating those sheep themselves, after all, and I am hungry now.” 
“At this rate, I suppose I shall be arrested for teaching you seditious thinking,” Laurence said, amused. 
“You sound positively revolutionary. Only think, perhaps the fellow who owns those is the same one we 
will ask to give us a nice lamb for your dinner tonight; he will hardly do so if we steal his sheep.” 
“I would rather have a nice lamb now,” Temeraire muttered, but he did not go after one of the sheep, and 
instead returned to examining the clouds. “May we go over to those clouds? I would like to see why they 
are moving like that.”

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Laurence looked at the shrouded hillside dubiously, but he more and more disliked telling the dragon no 
when he did not have to; it was so often necessary. “We may try it if you like,” he said, “but it seems a 
little risky; we could easily run up against the mountainside and be brought by the lee.” 
“Oh, I will land below them, and then we may walk up,” Temeraire said, crouching low and putting his 
neck to the ground so Laurence could scramble back aboard. “That will be more interesting in any case.” 
It was a little odd to go walking with a dragon, and very odd to outdistance one; Temeraire might take 
one step to every ten paces of Laurence’s, but he took them very rarely, being more occupied in looking 
back and forth to compare the degree of cloud cover upon the ground. Laurence finally walked some 
distance ahead and threw himself down upon the slope to wait; even under the heavy fog, he was 
comfortable, thanks to the heavy clothing and oilskin cloak which he had learned from experience to 
wear while flying. 
Temeraire continued to creep very slowly up the hill, interrupting his studies of the clouds now and 
again to look at a flower, or a pebble; to Laurence’s surprise, he paused at one point and dug a small 
rock out of the ground, which he then brought up to Laurence with apparent excitement, pushing it along 
with the tip of a talon, as it was too small for him to pick up in his claws. 
Laurence hefted the thing, which was about the size of his fist; it certainly was curious, pyrite 
intergrown with quartz crystal and rock. “How did you come to see it?” he said with interest, turning it 
over in his hands and brushing away more of the dirt. 
“A little of it was out of the ground and it was shining,” Temeraire said. “Is that gold? I like the look of 
it.” 
“No, it is just pyrite, but it is very pretty, is it not? I suppose you are one of those hoarding creatures,” 
Laurence said, looking affectionately up at Temeraire; many dragons had an inborn fascination with 
jewels or precious metals. “I am afraid I am not rich enough a partner for you; I will not be able to give 
you a heap of gold to sleep on.” 
“I should rather have you than a heap of gold, even if it were very comfortable to sleep on,” Temeraire 
said. “I do not mind the deck.” 
He said it quite normally, not in the least as though he meant to deliver a compliment, and immediately 
went back to looking at his clouds; Laurence was left gazing after him in a sensation of mingled 
amazement and extraordinary pleasure. He could scarcely imagine a similar feeling; the only parallel he 
could conceive from his old life would be if the Reliant had spoken to say she liked to have him for her 
captain: both praise and affection, from the highest source imaginable, and it filled him with fresh 
determination to prove worthy of the encomium.

“I am afraid I cannot help you, sir,” the old fellow said, scratching behind his ear as he straightened up 
from the heavy volume before him. “I have a dozen books of draconic breeds, and I cannot find him in 
any of them. Perhaps his coloration will change when he gets older?” 
Laurence frowned; this was the third naturalist he had consulted over the past week since landing in 
Madeira, and none of them had been able to give him any help whatsoever in determining Temeraire’s 
breed. 
“However,” the bookseller went on, “I can give you some hope; Sir Edward Howe of the Royal Society 
is here on the island, taking the waters; he came by my shop last week. I believe he is staying in Porto 
Moniz, at the north-western end of the island, and I am sure he will be able to identify your dragon for 
you; he has written several monographs on rare breeds from the Americas and the Orient.” 
“Thank you very much indeed; I am glad to hear it,” Laurence said, brightening at this news; the name 
was familiar to him, and he had met the man in London once or twice, so that he need not even scramble 
for an introduction. 
He went back out into the street in good humor, with a fine map of the island and a book on mineralogy 
for Temeraire. The day was particularly fine, and the dragon was presently sprawled out in the field 
which had been set aside for him some distance outside the city, sunning himself after a large meal. 
The governor had been more accommodating than Admiral Croft, perhaps due to the anxiety of his 
populace over the presence of a frequently hungry dragon in the middle of their port, and had opened the 
public treasury to provide Temeraire with a steady supply of sheep and cattle. Temeraire was not at all 
unhappy with the change in his diet, and he was continuing to grow; he would no longer have fit on the 
Reliant’s stern, and he was bidding fair to become longer than the ship itself. Laurence had taken a 
cottage beside the field, at small expense due to its owner’s sudden eagerness to be nowhere nearby, and 
the two of them were managing quite happily. 
He regretted his own final removal from the ship’s life when he had time to think of it, but keeping 
Temeraire exercised was a great deal of work, and he could always go into the town for his dinner. He 
often met Riley or some of his other officers; too, he had some other naval acquaintances in the town, 
and so he rarely passed a solitary evening. The nights were comfortable as well, even though he was 
obliged to return to the cottage early due to the distance; he had found a local servant, Fernao, who, 
although wholly unsmiling and taciturn, was not disturbed by the dragon and could prepare a reasonable 
breakfast and supper. 
Temeraire generally slept during the heat of the day, while he was gone, and woke again after the sun 
had set; after supper Laurence would go to sit outside and read to him by the light of a lantern. He had 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (33 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
never been much of a reader himself, but Temeraire’s pleasure in books was so great as to be infectious, 
and Laurence could not but think with satisfaction of the dragon’s likely delight in the new book, which 
spoke in great detail about gemstones and their mining, despite his own complete lack of interest in the 
subject. It was not the sort of life which he had ever expected to lead, but so far, at least, he had not 
suffered in any material way from his change of status, and Temeraire was developing into uncommonly 
good company. 
Laurence stopped in a coffeehouse and wrote Sir Edward a quick note with his direction, briefly 
explaining his circumstances and asking for permission to call. This he addressed to Porto Moniz, then 
sent off with the establishment’s post-boy, adding a half-crown to speed it along. He could have flown 
across the island much more quickly, of course, but he did not feel he could simply descend upon 
someone with no warning with a dragon in tow. He could wait; he still had at least a week of liberty left 
to him before a reply would come from Gibraltar with instructions on how to report for duty. 
But the dispatch-rider was due tomorrow, and the thought recalled him to an omitted duty: he had not 
yet written to his father. He could not let his parents learn of his altered circumstances from some 
secondhand account, or in the Gazette notice which should surely be printed, and with a sense of 
reluctant obligation he settled himself back down with a fresh pot of coffee to write the necessary letter. 
It was difficult to think what to say. Lord Allendale was not a particularly fond parent and was 
punctilious in his manners. The Army and Navy he thought barely acceptable alternatives to the Church 
for an impoverished younger son; he would no more have considered sending a son to the Corps than to 
a trade, and he would certainly neither sympathize nor approve. Laurence was well aware that he and his 
father disagreed on the score of duty; his father would certainly tell him it had been his duty to his name 
to stay well away from the dragon, and to leave some misguided idea of service out of the matter. 
His mother’s reaction he dreaded more; for she had real affection for him, and the news would make her 
unhappy for his sake. Then, also, she was friendly with Lady Galman, and what he wrote would 
certainly reach Edith’s ears. But he could not write in such terms as might reassure either of them 
without provoking his father extremely; and so he contented himself with a stilted, formal note that laid 
out the facts without embellishment, and avoided all appearance of complaint. It would have to do; still 
he sealed it with a sense of dissatisfaction before carrying it to the dispatch post by hand. 
This unpleasant task completed, he turned back for the hotel in which he had taken a room; he had 
invited Riley and Gibbs along with several other acquaintances to join him for dinner, in recompense of 
earlier hospitality from them. It was not yet two o’clock, and the shops were still open; he looked in the 
windows as he walked to distract himself from brooding upon the likely reaction of his family and 
nearest friends, and paused outside a small pawnbroker’s. 
The golden chain was absurdly heavy, the sort of thing no woman could wear and too gaudy for a man: 
thick square links with flat disks and small pearl drops hanging from them, alternated. But for the metal 
and gems alone he imagined it must be expensive; most likely far more than he should spend, for he was 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (34 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
being cautious with his funds now that he had no future prospect of prize-money. He stepped inside 
anyway and inquired; it was indeed too dear. 
“However, sir, perhaps this one would do?” the proprietor suggested, offering a different chain: it looked 
very much the same, only with no disks, and perhaps slightly thinner links. It was nearly half the price of 
the first; still expensive, but he took it, and then felt a little silly for it. 
He gave it to Temeraire that night anyway, and was a little surprised at the happiness with which it was 
received. Temeraire clutched the chain and would not put it aside; he brooded over it in the candlelight 
while Laurence read to him, and turned it this way and that to admire the light upon the gold and the 
pearls. When he slept at last, it remained entwined with his talons, and the next day Laurence was 
obliged to attach it securely to the harness before Temeraire would consent to fly. 
The curious reaction made him even more glad to find an enthusiastic invitation from Sir Edward 
awaiting him when they returned from their morning flight. Fernao brought the note out to him in the 
field when they landed, and Laurence read it aloud to Temeraire: the gentleman would receive them 
whenever they liked to come, and he could be found at the seashore near the bathing pools. 
“I am not tired,” Temeraire said; he was as curious to know his breed as Laurence. “We may go at once, 
if you like.” 
He had indeed been developing more and more endurance; Laurence decided they could easily stop and 
rest if needed, and climbed back aboard without even having shifted his clothing. Temeraire put out an 
unusual effort and the island whipped by in great sweeps of his wings, Laurence crouching low to his 
neck and squinting against the wind. 
They spiraled down to the shore less than an hour after lifting away, scattering bathers and seashore 
vendors as they landed upon the rocky shore. Laurence gazed after them in dismay for a moment, then 
frowned; if they were foolish enough to imagine that a properly harnessed dragon would hurt them, it 
was hardly his fault, and he patted Temeraire’s neck as he unstrapped himself and slid down. “I will go 
and see if I can find Sir Edward; stay here.” 
“I will,” said Temeraire absently; he was already peering with interest into the deep rocky pools about 
the shore, which had odd stone outcroppings and very clear water. 
Sir Edward did not prove very difficult to find; he had noticed the fleeing crowd and was already 
approaching, the only person in view, by the time Laurence had gone a quarter of a mile. They shook 
hands and exchanged pleasantries, but both of them were impatient to come to the real matter at hand, 
and Sir Edward assented eagerly as soon as Laurence ventured to suggest they should walk back to 
Temeraire. 
“A most unusual and charming name,” Sir Edward said, as they walked, unconsciously making

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Laurence’s heart sink. “Most often they are given Roman names, extravagant ones; but then most 
aviators go into harness a great deal younger than you, and have a tendency to puff themselves up. There 
is something quite absurd about a two-ton Winchester called Imperatorius. Why, Laurence, however did 
you teach him to swim?” 
Startled, Laurence looked, then stared: in his absence, Temeraire had gone into the water and was now 
paddling himself about. “Lord, no; I have never seen him do it before,” he said. “How can he not be 
sinking? Temeraire! Do come out of the water,” he called, a little anxious. 
Sir Edward watched with interest as Temeraire swam towards them and climbed back up onto shore. 
“How extraordinary. The internal air-sacs which permit them to fly would, I imagine, make a dragon 
naturally buoyant, and having grown up on the ocean as he has, perhaps he would have no natural fear of 
the element.” 
This mention of air-sacs was a piece of new information to Laurence, but the dragon was joining them, 
so he saved the further questions that immediately sprang to mind. “Temeraire, this is Sir Edward 
Howe,” Laurence said. 
“Hello,” said Temeraire, peering down with interest equal to that with which he was observed. “I am 
very pleased to meet you. Can you tell me what breed I am?” 
Sir Edward did not seem nonplussed by this direct approach, and he made a bow in reply. “I hope I will 
be able to give you some information, indeed; may I ask you to be so kind as to move some distance up 
the shore, perhaps by that tree which you see over there, and spread your wings, so we may better see 
your full conformation?” 
Temeraire went willingly, and Sir Edward observed his motion. “Hm, very odd, not characteristic at all, 
the way he holds his tail. Laurence, you say his egg was found in Brazil?” 
“As to that, I cannot properly tell you, I am afraid,” Laurence said, studying Temeraire’s tail; he could 
see nothing unusual, but of course he had no real basis for comparison. Temeraire carried his tail off the 
ground, and it lashed the air gently as he walked. “We took him from a French prize, and she was most 
recently come from Rio, judging by the markings on some of her water casks, but more than that I 
cannot say. The logs were thrown overboard as we took her, and the captain very naturally refused to 
give us any information about where the egg was discovered. But I assume it could not have come from 
much further, due to the length of the journey.” 
“Oh, that is by no means certain,” Sir Edward said. “There are some subspecies which mature in the 
shell for upwards of ten years, and twenty months is a common average. Good Lord.” 
Temeraire had just spread out his wings; they were still dripping water. “Yes?” Laurence asked 
hopefully. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (36 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Laurence, my God, those wings,” Sir Edward cried, and literally ran across the shore towards 
Temeraire. Laurence blinked and went after him, and caught up to him only by the dragon’s side. Sir 
Edward was gently stroking one of the six spines that divided the sections of Temeraire’s wings, gazing 
at it with greedy passion. Temeraire had craned his head about to watch, but was keeping otherwise still, 
and did not seem to mind having his wing handled. 
“Do you recognize him, then?” Laurence asked Sir Edward tentatively; the man looked quite 
overwhelmed. 
“Recognize? Not, I assure you, in the sense of ever having seen his kind before; there can scarcely be 
three living men in Europe who have, and on the strength of this one glance I am already furnished with 
enough material for an address to the Royal Society,” Sir Edward answered. “But the wings are 
irrefutable, and the number of talons: he is a Chinese Imperial, although of which line I certainly cannot 
tell you. Oh, Laurence, what a prize!” 
Laurence gazed at the wings, bemused; it had not occurred to him before that the fan-like divisions were 
unusual, nor the five talons which Temeraire had upon each foot. “An Imperial?” he said, with an 
uncertain smile; he wondered for a moment if Sir Edward was practicing a joke on him. The Chinese 
had been breeding dragons for thousands of years before the Romans had ever domesticated the wild 
breeds of Europe; they were violently jealous of their work, and rarely permitted even grown specimens 
of minor breeds to leave the country. It was absurd to think that the French had been trundling an 
Imperial egg across the Atlantic in a thirty-six-gun frigate. 
“Is that a good breed?” Temeraire asked. “Will I be able to breathe fire?” 
“Dear creature, the very best of all possible breeds; only the Celestials are more rare or valuable, and 
were you one of those, I suppose the Chinese would go to war over our having put you into harness, so 
we must be glad you are not,” Sir Edward said. “But though I will not rule it out entirely, I think it 
unlikely you will be able to breathe fire. The Chinese breed first for intelligence and grace; they have 
such overwhelming air superiority they do not need to seek such abilities in their lines. Japanese dragons 
are far more likely among the Oriental breeds to have any special offensive capabilities.” 
“Oh,” said Temeraire glumly. 
“Temeraire, do not be absurd, it is the most famous news anyone could imagine,” Laurence said, 
beginning to believe at last; this was too far to carry a joke. “You are quite certain, sir?” he could not 
help asking. 
“Oh yes,” Sir Edward said, returning to his examination of the wings. “Only look at the delicacy of the 
membrane; the consistency of the color throughout the body, and the coordination between the color of 
the eyes and the markings. I should have seen he was a Chinese breed at once; it is quite impossible that 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (37 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
he should have come from the wild, and no European or Incan breeder is capable of such work. And,” he 
added, “this explains the swimming as well: Chinese beasts often have an affinity for water, if I recall 
correctly.” 
“An Imperial,” Laurence murmured, stroking Temeraire’s side in wonder. “It is incredible; they ought to 
have convoyed him with half their fleet, or sent a handler to him rather than the reverse.” 
“Perhaps they did not know what they had,” Sir Edward said. “Chinese eggs are notoriously difficult to 
categorize by appearance, other than having the texture of fine porcelain. I do not suppose, by the by, 
that you have any of the eggshell preserved?” he asked wistfully. 
“Not I, but perhaps some of the hands may have saved a bit,” Laurence said. “I would be happy to make 
inquiry for you; I am deeply indebted to you.” 
“Not at all; the debt is entirely on my side. To think that I have seen an Imperial—and spoken with one!” 
He bowed to Temeraire. “In that, I may be unique among Englishmen, although le Comte de la Pérouse 
wrote in his journals of having spoken with one in Korea, in the palace of their king.” 
“I would like to read that,” Temeraire said. “Laurence, can you get a copy?” 
“I will certainly try,” Laurence said. “And sir, I would be very grateful if you could recommend some 
texts to my attention; I would be glad of any knowledge of the habits and behaviors of the breed.” 
“Well, there are precious few resources, I am afraid; you will shortly be more of an expert than any other 
European, I imagine,” Sir Edward said. “But I will certainly give you a list, and I have several texts I 
would be happy to lend you, including the journals of La Pérouse. If Temeraire does not mind waiting 
here, perhaps we can walk back to my hotel and retrieve them; I am afraid he would not fit very 
comfortably in the village.” 
“I do not mind at all; I will go swimming again,” Temeraire said. 
  
Having taken tea with Sir Edward and collected a number of books from him, Laurence found a 
shepherd in the village willing to take his money, so he could feed Temeraire before their return journey. 
He was forced to drag the sheep down to the shore himself, however, with the animal bleating wildly 
and trying to get away long before Temeraire even came into view. Laurence ended up having to carry it 
bodily, and it took its final revenge by defecating upon him just before he flung it down at last in front of 
the eager dragon. 
While Temeraire feasted, he stripped to the skin and scrubbed his clothing as best he could in the water, 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (38 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
then left the wet things on a sunny rock to dry while the two of them bathed together. Laurence was not 
a particularly good swimmer himself, but with Temeraire to hold on to, he could risk the deeper water 
where the dragon could swim. Temeraire’s delight in the water was infectious, and in the end Laurence 
too succumbed to playfulness, splashing the dragon and plunging under the water to come up on his 
other side. 
The water was beautifully warm, and there were many outcroppings of rock to crawl out upon for a rest, 
some large enough for both of them; when he at last led Temeraire back onto the shore, several hours 
had gone by, and the sun was sinking rapidly. He was guiltily glad the other bathers had stayed away; he 
would have been ashamed to be seen frolicking like a boy. 
The sun was warm on their backs as they winged across the island back to Funchal, both of them 
brimming with satisfaction, with the precious books wrapped in oilskin and strapped to the harness. “I 
will read to you from the journals tonight,” Laurence was saying, when he was interrupted by a loud, 
bugling call ahead of them. 
Temeraire was so startled he stopped in mid-air, hovering for a moment; then he roared back, a strangely 
tentative sound. He launched himself forwards again, and in a moment Laurence saw the source of the 
call: a pale grey dragon with mottled white markings upon its belly and white striations across its wings, 
almost invisible against the cloud cover; it was a great distance above them. 
It swooped down very quickly and drew alongside them; he could see that it was smaller than 
Temeraire, even at his present size, but it could glide along on a single beat of its wings for much longer. 
Its rider was wearing grey leather that matched its hide, and a heavy hood; he unhooked several clasps 
on this and pushed it to hang back off his head. “Captain James, on Volatilus, dispatch service,” he said, 
staring at Laurence in open curiosity. 
Laurence hesitated; a response was obviously called for, but he was not quite sure how to style himself, 
for he had not yet been formally discharged from the Navy, nor formally inducted into the Corps. 
“Captain Laurence of His Majesty’s Navy,” he said finally, “on Temeraire; I am at present unassigned. 
Are you headed for Funchal?” 
“Navy—? Yes, I am, and I expect you had better be as well, after that introduction,” James said; he had 
a pleasant-looking long face, but Laurence’s reply had marred it by a deep frown. “How old is that 
dragonet, and where did you get him?” 
“I am three weeks and five days out of the shell, and Laurence won me in a battle,” Temeraire said, 
before Laurence could reply. “How did you meet James?” he asked, addressing the other dragon. 
Volatilus blinked large milky blue eyes and said, in a bright voice, “I was hatched! From an egg!” 
“Oh?” said Temeraire, uncertainly, and turned his head around to Laurence with a startled look.

Laurence shook his head quickly, to keep him silent. 
“Sir, if you have questions, they can be best answered on the ground,” he said to James, a little coldly; 
there had been a peremptory quality he did not like in the other man’s tone. “Temeraire and I are staying 
just outside the town; do you care to accompany us, or shall we follow you to your landing grounds?” 
James had been looking with surprise at Temeraire, and he answered Laurence with a little more 
warmth, “Oh, let us go to yours; the moment I set down officially, I will be mobbed with people wanting 
to send parcels; we will not be able to talk.” 
“Very well; it is a field to the south-west of the city,” Laurence said. “Temeraire, pray take the lead.” 
The grey dragon had no difficulty keeping up, though Laurence thought Temeraire was secretly trying to 
pull away; Volatilus had clearly been bred, and bred successfully, for speed. English breeders were 
gifted at working with their limited stocks to achieve specific results, but evidently intelligence had been 
sacrificed in the process of achieving this particular one. 
They landed together, to the anxious lowing of the cattle that had been delivered for Temeraire’s dinner. 
“Temeraire, be gentle with him,” Laurence said quietly. “Some dragons do not have very good 
understanding, like some people; you remember Bill Swallow, on the Reliant.” 
“Oh, yes,” Temeraire said, equally low. “I understand now; I will be careful. Do you think he would like 
one of my cows?” 
“Would he care for something to eat?” Laurence asked James, as they both dismounted and met on the 
ground. “Temeraire has already eaten this afternoon; he can spare a cow.” 
“Why, that is very kind of you,” James said, thawing visibly. “I am sure he would like it very much, 
wouldn’t you, you bottomless pit,” he went on affectionately, patting Volatilus’s neck. 
“Cows!” Volatilus said, staring at them with wide eyes. 
“Come and have some with me, we can eat over here,” Temeraire said to the little grey, and sat up to 
snatch a pair of the cows over the wall of the pen. He laid them out in a clean grassy part of the field, 
and Volatilus eagerly trotted over to share when Temeraire beckoned. 
“It is uncommonly generous of you, and of him,” James said, as Laurence led him to the cottage. “I have 
never seen one of the big ones share like that; what breed is he?” 
“I am not myself an expert, and he came to us without provenance; but Sir Edward Howe has just today 
identified him as an Imperial,” Laurence said, feeling a little embarrassed; it seemed like showing off, 
but of course it was just plain fact, and he could not avoid telling people.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
James stumbled over the threshold on the news and nearly fell into Fernao. “Are you—oh, Lord, you are 
not joking,” he said, recovering and handing his leather coat off. “But how did you find him, and how 
did you come to put him into harness?” 
Laurence himself would never have dreamed of interrogating a host in such a way, but he concealed his 
opinion of James’s manners; the circumstances surely warranted some leeway. “I will be happy to tell 
you,” he said, showing the other man into the sitting room. “I should like your advice, in fact, on how I 
am to proceed. Will you have some tea?” 
“Yes, although coffee if you have it,” James said, pulling a chair closer to the fire; he sprawled into it 
with his leg slung over the arm. “Damn, it’s good to sit for a minute; we have been in the air for seven 
hours.” 
“Seven hours? You must be shattered,” Laurence said, startled. “I had no idea they could stay aloft that 
long.” 
“Oh, bless you, I have been on fourteen-hour flights,” James said. “I shouldn’t try it with yours, though; 
Volly can stay up beating his wings once an hour, in fine weather.” He yawned enormously. “Still, it’s 
no joke, not with the air currents over the ocean.” 
Fernao came in with coffee and tea, and once they were both served, Laurence briefly described 
Temeraire’s acquisition and harnessing for James, who listened in open amazement while drinking five 
cups of coffee and eating through two platefuls of sandwiches. 
“So as you see, I am at something of a loss; Admiral Croft has written a dispatch to the Corps at 
Gibraltar asking for instructions regarding my situation, which I trust you will carry, but I confess I 
would be grateful for some idea of what to expect,” he finished. 
“You’re asking the wrong fellow, I’m afraid,” James said cheerfully, draining a sixth cup. “Never heard 
of anything like it, and I can’t even give you advance warning about training. I was told off for the 
dispatch service by the time I was twelve, and on Volly by fourteen; you’ll be doing heavy combat with 
your beauty. But,” he added, “I’ll spare you any more waiting: I’ll pop over to the landing grounds, get 
the post, and take your admiral’s dispatch over tonight. I shouldn’t be surprised if you have a senior cap 
over to see you before dinnertime tomorrow.” 
“I beg your pardon, a senior what?” Laurence said, forced to ask in desperation; James’s mode of 
speaking had grown steadily looser with the coffee he consumed. 
“Senior captain,” James said. He grinned, swung his leg down, and climbed out of the chair, standing up 
on his toes to stretch. “You’ll make an aviator; I almost forget I’m not talking to one.”

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Thank you; that is a handsome compliment,” Laurence said, though privately he wished James would 
have made more of an effort to remember. “But surely you will not fly through the night?” 
“Of course; no need to lie about here, in this weather. That coffee has put the life back in me, and on a 
cow Volly could fly to China and back,” he said. “We’ll have a better berth over on Gibraltar anyway. 
Off I go,” and with this remark he walked out of the sitting room, took his own coat from the closet, and 
strolled out the door whistling, while Laurence hesitated, taken aback, and only belatedly went after him. 
Volly came bounding up to James with a couple of short fluttering hops, babbling to him excitedly about 
cows and “Temrer,” which was the best he could do at Temeraire’s name; James petted him and climbed 
back up. “Thanks again; will see you on my rounds if you do your training at Gibraltar,” he said, waved 
a hand, and with a flurry of grey wings they were a quickly diminishing figure in the twilight sky. 
“He was very happy to have the cow,” Temeraire said after a moment, standing looking after them 
beside Laurence. 
Laurence laughed at this faint praise and reached up to scratch Temeraire’s neck gently. “I am sorry 
your first meeting with another dragon was not very auspicious,” he said. “But he and James will be 
taking Admiral Croft’s message to Gibraltar for us, and in another day or two I expect you will be 
meeting more congenial minds.” 
 
 
James had evidently not been exaggerating in his estimate, however; Laurence had just set out for town 
the next afternoon when a great shadow crossed over the harbor, and he looked up to see an enormous 
red-and-gold beast sailing by overhead, making for the landing grounds on the outskirts of the town. He 
at once set out for the Commendable, expecting any communication to reach him there, and none too 
soon; halfway there a breathless young midshipman tracked him down, and told him that Admiral Croft 
had sent for him. 
Two aviators were waiting for him in Croft’s stateroom: Captain Portland, a tall, thin man with severe 
features and a hawksbill nose, who looked rather dragon-like himself, and Lieutenant Dayes, a young 
man scarcely twenty years of age, with a long queue of pale red hair and pale eyebrows to match, and an 
unfriendly expression. Their manner was as aloof as reputation made that of all aviators, and unlike 
James they showed no signs of unbending towards him. 
“Well, Laurence, you are a very lucky fellow,” Croft said, as soon as Laurence had suffered through the 
stilted introductions, “We will have you back in the Reliant after all.” 
Still in the process of considering the aviators, Laurence paused at this. “I beg your pardon?” he said. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (42 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Portland gave Croft a swift contemptuous glance; but then the remark about luck had certainly been 
tactless, if not offensive. “You have indeed performed a singular service for the Corps,” he said stiffly, 
turning to Laurence, “but I hope we will not have to ask you to continue that service any further. 
Lieutenant Dayes is here to relieve you.” 
Laurence looked in confusion at Dayes, who stared back with a hint of belligerence in his eye. “Sir,” he 
said slowly; he could not quite think, “I was under the impression that a dragon’s handler could not be 
relieved: that he had to be present at its hatching. Am I mistaken?” 
“Under ordinary circumstances, you are correct, and it is certainly desirable,” Portland said. “However, 
on occasion a handler is lost, to disease or injury, and we have been able to convince the dragon to 
accept a new aviator in more than half of such cases. I expect here that his youth will render Temeraire,” 
his voice lingered on the name with a faint air of distaste, “even more amenable to the replacement.” 
“I see,” Laurence said; it was all he could manage. Three weeks ago, the news would have given him the 
greatest joy; now it seemed oddly flat. 
“Naturally we are grateful to you,” Portland said, perhaps feeling some more civil response was called 
for. “But he will do much better in the hands of a trained aviator, and I am sure that the Navy cannot 
easily spare us so devoted an officer.” 
“You are very kind, sir,” Laurence said formally, bowing. The compliment had not been a natural one, 
but he could see that the rest of the remark was meant sincerely enough, and it made perfect sense. 
Certainly Temeraire would do better in the hands of a trained aviator, a fellow who would handle him 
properly, the same way a ship would do better in the hands of a real seaman. It had been wholly an 
accident that Temeraire had been settled upon him, and now that he knew the truly extraordinary nature 
of the dragon, it was even more obvious that Temeraire deserved a partner with an equal degree of skill. 
“Of course you would prefer a trained man in the position if at all possible, and I am happy if I have 
been of any service. Shall I take Mr. Dayes to Temeraire now?” 
“No!” Dayes said sharply, only to fall silent at a look from Portland. 
Portland answered more politely, “No, thank you, Captain; on the contrary, we prefer to proceed exactly 
as if the dragon’s handler had died, to keep the procedure as close as possible to the set methods which 
we have devised for accustoming the creature to a new handler. It would be best if you did not see the 
dragon again at all.” 
That was a blow. Laurence almost argued, but in the end he closed his mouth and only bowed again. If it 
would make the process of transition easier, it was only his duty to keep away. 
Still, it was very unpleasant to think of never seeing Temeraire again; he had made no farewell, said no 
last kind words, and to simply stay away felt like a desertion. Sorrow weighed on him heavily as he left 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (43 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
the Commendable, and it had not dissipated by evening; he was meeting Riley and Wells for dinner, and 
when he came into the parlor of the hotel where they were waiting for him, it was an effort to give them 
a smile and say, “Well, gentlemen, it seems you are not to be rid of me after all.” 
They looked surprised; shortly they were both congratulating him enthusiastically, and toasting his 
freedom. “It is the best news I have heard in a fortnight,” Riley said, raising a glass. “To your health, 
sir.” He was very clearly sincere despite the promotion it would likely cost him, and Laurence was 
deeply affected; consciousness of their true friendship lifted the grief at least a little, and he was able to 
return the toast with something approaching his usual demeanor. 
“It does seem they went about it rather strangely, though,” Wells said a little later, frowning over 
Laurence’s brief description of the meeting. “Almost like an insult, sir, and to the Navy, too; as though a 
naval officer were not good enough for them.” 
“No, not at all,” Laurence said, although privately he did not feel very sure of his interpretation. “Their 
concern is for Temeraire, I am sure, and rightly so, as well as for the Corps; one could scarcely expect 
them to be glad at the prospect of having an untrained fellow on the back of so valuable a creature, any 
more than we would like to see an Army officer given command of a first-rate.” 
So he said, and so he believed, but that was not very much of a consolation. As the evening wore on, he 
grew more rather than less conscious of the grief of parting, despite the companionship and the good 
food. It had already become a settled habit with him to spend the nights reading with Temeraire, or 
talking to him, or sleeping by his side, and this sudden break was painful. He knew that he was not 
perfectly concealing his feelings; Riley and Wells gave him anxious glances as they talked more to 
cover his silences, but he could not force himself to a feigned display of happiness which would have 
reassured them. 
The pudding had been served and he was making an attempt to get some of it down when a boy came 
running in with a note for him: it was from Captain Portland; he was asked in urgent terms to come to 
the cottage. Laurence started up from the table at once, barely making a few words of explanation, and 
dashed out into the street without even waiting for his overcoat. The Madeira night was warm, and he 
did not mind the lack, particularly after he had been walking briskly for a few minutes; by the time he 
reached the cottage he would have been glad of an excuse to remove his neckcloth. 
The lights were on inside; he had offered the use of the establishment to Captain Portland for their 
convenience, as it was near the field. When Fernao opened the door for him, he came in to find Dayes 
with his head in his hands at the dinner table, surrounded by several other young men in the uniform of 
the Corps, and Portland standing by the fireplace and gazing into it with a rigid, disapproving 
expression. 
“Has something happened?” Laurence asked. “Is Temeraire ill?” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (44 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“No,” Portland said shortly, “he has refused to accept the replacement.” 
Dayes abruptly pushed up from the table and took a step towards Laurence. “It is not to be borne! An 
Imperial in the hands of some untrained Navy clodpole—” he cried. He was stifled by his friends before 
anything more could escape him, but the expression had still been shockingly offensive, and Laurence at 
once gripped the hilt of his sword. 
“Sir, you must answer,” he said angrily, “that is more than enough.” 
“Stop that; there is no dueling in the Corps,” Portland said. “Andrews, for God’s sake put him to bed and 
get some laudanum into him.” The young man restraining Dayes’s left arm nodded, and he and the other 
three pulled the struggling lieutenant out of the room, leaving Laurence and Portland alone, with Fernao 
standing wooden-faced in the corner still holding a tray with the port decanter upon it. 
Laurence wheeled on Portland. “A gentleman cannot be expected to tolerate such a remark.” 
“An aviator’s life is not only his own; he cannot be allowed to risk it so pointlessly,” Portland said flatly. 
“There is no dueling in the Corps.” 
The repeated pronouncement had the weight of law, and Laurence was forced to see the justice in it; his 
hand relaxed minutely, though the angry color did not leave his face. “Then he must apologize, sir, to 
myself and to the Navy; it was an outrageous remark.” 
Portland said, “And I suppose you have never made nor listened to equally outrageous remarks made 
about aviators, or the Corps?” 
Laurence fell silent before the open bitterness in Portland’s voice. It had never before occurred to him 
that aviators themselves would surely hear such remarks and resent them; now he understood still more 
how savage that resentment must be, given that they could not even make answer by the code of their 
service. “Captain,” he said at last, more quietly, “if such remarks have ever been made in my presence, I 
may say that I have never been responsible for them myself, and where possible I have spoken against 
them harshly. I have never willingly heard disparaging words against any division of His Majesty’s 
armed forces; nor will I ever.” 
It was now Portland’s turn to be silent, and though his tone was grudging, he did finally say, “I accused 
you unjustly; I apologize. I hope that Dayes, too, will make his apologies when he is less distraught; he 
would not have spoken so if he had not just suffered so bitter a disappointment.” 
“I understood from what you said that there was a known risk,” Laurence said. “He ought not have built 
his expectations so high; surely he can expect to succeed with a hatchling.” 
“He accepted the risk,” Portland said. “He has spent his right to promotion. He will not be permitted to 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (45 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
make another attempt, unless he wins another chance under fire; and that is unlikely.” 
So Dayes was in the same position which Riley had occupied before their last voyage, save perhaps with 
even less chance, dragons being so very rare in England. Laurence still could not forgive the insult, but 
he understood the emotion better; and he could not help feeling pity for the fellow, who was after all 
only a boy. “I see; I will be happy to accept an apology,” he said; it was as far as he could bring himself 
to go. 
Portland looked relieved. “I am glad to hear it,” he said. “Now, I think it would be best if you went to 
speak to Temeraire; he will have missed you, and I believe he was not pleased to be asked to take on a 
replacement. I hope we may speak again tomorrow; we have left your bedroom untouched, so you need 
not shift for yourself.” 
Laurence needed little encouragement; moments later he was striding to the field. As he drew near, he 
could make out Temeraire’s bulk by the light of the half-moon: the dragon was curled in small upon 
himself and nearly motionless, only stroking his gold chain between his foreclaws. “Temeraire,” he 
called, coming through the gate, and the proud head lifted at once. 
“Laurence?” he said; the uncertainty in his voice was painful to hear. 
“Yes, I am here,” Laurence said, crossing swiftly to him, almost running at the end. Making a soft 
crooning noise deep in his throat, Temeraire curled both forelegs and wings around him and nuzzled him 
carefully; Laurence stroked the sleek nose. 
“He said you did not like dragons, and that you wanted to be back on your ship,” Temeraire said, very 
low. “He said you only flew with me out of duty.” 
Laurence went breathless with rage; if Dayes had been in front of him he would have flown at the man 
bare-handed and beaten him. “He was lying, Temeraire,” he said with difficulty; he was half-choked by 
fury. 
“Yes; I thought he was,” Temeraire said. “But it was not pleasant to hear, and he tried to take away my 
chain. It made me very angry. And he would not leave, until I put him out, and then you still did not 
come; I thought maybe he would keep you away, and I did not know where to go to find you.” 
Laurence leaned forward and laid his cheek against the soft, warm hide. “I am so very sorry,” he said. 
“They persuaded me it was in your best interests to stay away and let him try; but I should have seen 
what kind of a fellow he was.” 
Temeraire was quiet for several minutes, while they stood comfortably together, then said, “Laurence, I 
suppose I am too large to be on a ship now?” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (46 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Yes, pretty much, except for a dragon transport,” Laurence said, lifting his head; he was puzzled by the 
question. 
“If you would like to have your ship back,” Temeraire said, “I will let someone else ride me. Not him, 
because he says things that are not true; but I will not make you stay.” 
Laurence stood motionless for a moment, his hands still on Temeraire’s head, with the dragon’s warm 
breath curling around him. “No, my dear,” he said at last, softly, knowing it was only the truth. “I would 
rather have you than any ship in the Navy.” 
  
  
Chapter 4 
 
“NO, THROW YOUR chest out deeper, like so.” Laetificat stood up on her haunches and 
demonstrated, the enormous barrel of her red-and-gold belly expanding as she breathed in. 
Temeraire mimicked the motion; his expansion was less visually dramatic, as he lacked the vivid 
markings of the female Regal Copper and was of course less than a fifth of her size as yet, but this time 
he managed a much louder roar. “Oh, there,” he said, pleased, dropping back down to four legs. The 
cows were all running around their pen in manic terror. 
“Much better,” Laetificat said, and nudged Temeraire’s back approvingly. “Practice every time you eat; 
it will help along your lung capacity.” 
“I suppose it is hardly news to you how badly we need him, given how our affairs stand,” Portland said, 
turning to Laurence; the two of them were standing by the side of the field, out of range of the mess the 
dragons were about to make. “Most of Bonaparte’s dragons are stationed along the Rhine, and of course 
he has been busy in Italy; that and our naval blockades are all that is keeping him from invasion. But if 
he gets matters arranged to his satisfaction on the Continent and frees up a few aerial divisions, we can 
say hail and farewell to the blockade at Toulon; we simply do not have enough dragons of our own here 
in the Med to protect Nelson’s fleet. He will have to withdraw, and then Villeneuve will go straight for 
the Channel.” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (47 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Laurence nodded grimly; he had been reading the news of Bonaparte’s movements with great alarm 
since the Reliant had put into port. “I know Nelson has been trying to lure the French fleet out to battle, 
but Villeneuve is not a fool, even if he is no seaman. An aerial bombardment is the only hope of getting 
him out of his safe harbor.” 
“Which means there is no hope, not with the forces we can bring to it at present,” Portland said. “The 
Home Division has a couple of Longwings, and they might be able to do it; but they cannot be spared. 
Bonaparte would jump on the Channel Fleet at once.” 
“Ordinary bombing would not do?” 
“Not precise enough at long range, and they have poisoned shrapnel guns at Toulon. No aviator worth a 
shilling would take his beast close to the fortifications.” Portland shook his head. “No, but there is a 
young Longwing in training, and if Temeraire will be kind enough to hurry up and grow, then perhaps 
together they might shortly be able to take the place of Excidium or Mortiferus at the Channel, and even 
one of those two might be sufficient at Toulon.” 
“I am sure he will do everything in his power to oblige you,” Laurence said, glancing over; the dragon in 
question was on his second cow. “And I may say that I will do the same. I know I am not the man you 
wished in this place, nor can I argue with the reasoning that would prefer an experienced aviator in so 
critical a role. But I hope that naval experience will not prove wholly useless in this arena.” 
Portland sighed and looked down at the ground. “Oh, hell,” he said. It was an odd response to make, but 
Portland looked anxious, not angry, and after a moment he added, “There is just no getting around it; 
you are not an aviator. If it were simply a question of skill or knowledge, that would mean difficulties 
enough, but—” He stopped. 
Laurence did not think, from the tone, that Portland meant to question his courage. The man had been 
more amiable this morning; so far, it seemed to Laurence that aviators simply took clannishness to an 
extreme, and once having admitted a fellow into their circle, their cold manners fell away. So he took no 
offense, and said, “Sir, I can hardly imagine where else you believe the difficulty might lie.” 
“No, you cannot,” Portland said, uncommunicatively. “Well, and I am not going to borrow trouble; they 
may decide to send you somewhere else entirely, not to Loch Laggan. But I am running ahead of myself: 
the real point is that you and Temeraire must get to England for your training soonest; once you are 
there, Aerial Command can best decide how to deal with you.” 
“But can he reach England from here, with no place to stop along the way?” Laurence asked, diverted by 
concern for Temeraire. “It must be more than a thousand miles; he has never flown further than from 
one end of the island to the other.” 
“Closer to two thousand, and no; we would never risk him so,” Portland said. “There is a transport 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (48 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
coming over from Nova Scotia; a couple of dragons joined our division from it three days ago, so we 
have its position pretty well fixed, and I think it is less than a hundred miles away. We will escort you to 
it; if Temeraire gets tired, Laetificat can support him for long enough to give him a breather.” 
Laurence was relieved to hear the proposed plan, but the conversation made him aware how very 
unpleasant his circumstances would be until his ignorance was mended. If Portland had waved off his 
fears, Laurence would have had no way of judging the matter for himself. Even a hundred miles was a 
good distance; it would take them three hours or more in the air. But that at least he felt confident they 
could manage; they had flown the length of the island three times just the other day, while visiting Sir 
Edward, and Temeraire had not seemed tired in the least. 
“When do you propose leaving?” he asked. 
“The sooner, the better; the transport is headed away from us, after all,” Portland said. “Can you be 
ready in half an hour?” 
Laurence stared. “I suppose I can, if I have most of my things sent back to the Reliant for transport,” he 
said dubiously. 
“Why would you?” Portland said. “Laet can carry anything you have; we shan’t weigh Temeraire 
down.” 
“No, I only mean that my things are not packed,” Laurence said. “I am used to waiting for the tide; I see 
I will have to be a little more beforehand with the world from now on.” 
Portland still looked puzzled, and when he came into Laurence’s room twenty minutes later he stared 
openly at the sea-chest that Laurence had turned to this new purpose. There had hardly been time to fill 
half of it; Laurence paused in the act of putting in a couple of blankets to take up the empty space at the 
top. “Is something wrong?” he asked, looking down; the chest was not so large that he thought it would 
give Laetificat any difficulty. 
“No wonder you needed the time; do you always pack so carefully?” Portland said. “Could you not just 
throw the rest of your things into a few bags? We can strap them on easily enough.” 
Laurence swallowed his first response; he no longer needed to wonder why the aviators looked, to a 
man, rumpled in their dress; he had imagined it due to some advanced technique of flying. “No, thank 
you; Fernao will take my other things to the Reliant, and I can manage perfectly well with what I have 
here,” he said, putting the blankets in; he strapped them down and made all fast, then locked the chest. 
“There; I am at your service now.” 
Portland called in a couple of his midwingmen to carry the chest; Laurence followed them outside, and 
was witness, for the first time, to the operation of a full aerial crew. Temeraire and he both watched with

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
interest from the side as Laetificat stood patiently under the swarming ensigns, who ran up and down her 
sides as easily as they hung below her belly or climbed upon her back. The boys were raising up two 
canvas enclosures, one above and one below; these were like small, lopsided tents, framed with many 
thin and flexible strips of metal. The front panels which formed the bulk of the tent were long and 
sloped, evidently to present as little resistance to the wind as possible, and the sides and back were made 
of netting. 
The ensigns all looked to be below the age of twelve; the midwingmen ranged more widely, just as 
aboard a ship, and now four older ones came staggering with the weight of a heavy leather-wrapped 
chain they dragged in front of Laetificat. The dragon lifted it herself and laid it over her withers, just in 
front of the tent, and the ensigns hurried to secure it to the rest of the harness with many straps and 
smaller chains. 
Using this strap, they then slung a sort of hammock made of chain links beneath Laetificat’s belly. 
Laurence saw his own chest tossed inside along with a collection of other bags and parcels; he winced at 
the haphazard way in which the baggage was stowed, and was doubly grateful that he had been careful 
in his packing: he was confident they might turn his chest completely about a dozen times without 
casting his things into disarray. 
A large pad of leather and wool, perhaps the thickness of a man’s arm, was laid on top of all, then the 
hammock’s edges were drawn up and hooked to the harness as widely as possible, spreading the weight 
of the contents and pressing them close to the dragon’s belly. Laurence felt a sense of dissatisfaction 
with the proceedings; he privately thought he would have to find a better arrangement for Temeraire, 
when the time came. 
However, the process had one significant advantage over naval preparations: from beginning to end it 
took fifteen minutes, and then they were looking at a dragon in full light-duty rig. Laetificat reared up on 
her legs, shook out her wings, and beat them half a dozen times; the wind was strong enough to nearly 
stagger Laurence, but the assembled baggage did not shift noticeably. 
“All lies well,” Laetificat said, dropping back down to all fours; the ground shook with the impact. 
“Lookouts aboard,” Portland said; four ensigns climbed on and took up positions at the shoulders and 
hips, above and below, hooking themselves on to the harness. “Topmen and bellmen.” Now two groups 
of eight midwingmen climbed up, one going into the tent above, the other below: Laurence was startled 
to perceive how large the enclosures really were; they seemed small only by virtue of comparison with 
Laetificat’s immense size. 
The crews were followed in turn by the twelve riflemen, who had been checking and arming their guns 
while the others rigged out the gear. Laurence noticed Lieutenant Dayes leading them, and frowned; he 
had forgotten about the fellow in the rush. Dayes had offered no apology; now most likely they would 
not see one another for a long time. Perhaps it was for the best; Laurence was not sure that he could have

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
accepted the apology, after hearing Temeraire’s story, and as it was impossible to call the fellow out, the 
situation would have been uncomfortable to say the least. 
The riflemen having boarded, Portland walked a complete circuit around and beneath the dragon. “Very 
good; ground crew aboard.” The handful of men remaining climbed into the belly-rigging and strapped 
themselves in; only then did Portland himself ascend, Laetificat lifting him up directly. He repeated his 
inspection on the top, maneuvering around on the harness with as much ease as any of the little ensigns, 
and finally came to his position at the base of the dragon’s neck. “I believe we are ready; Captain 
Laurence?” 
Laurence belatedly realized he was still standing on the ground; he had been too interested in the process 
to mount up himself. He turned, but before he could clamber onto the harness, Temeraire reached out 
carefully and put him aboard, mimicking Laetificat’s action. Laurence grinned privately and patted the 
dragon’s neck. “Thank you, Temeraire,” he said, strapping himself in; Portland had pronounced his 
improvised harness adequate for the journey, although with a disapproving air. “Sir, we are ready,” he 
called to Portland. 
“Proceed, then; smallest goes aloft first,” Portland said. “We will take the lead once in the air.” 
Laurence nodded; Temeraire gathered himself and leapt, and the world fell away beneath them. 
  
Aerial Command was situated in the countryside just south-east of Chatham, close enough to London to 
permit daily consultation with the Admiralty and the War Office; it had been an easy hour’s flight from 
Dover, with the rolling green fields he knew so well spread out below like a checkerboard, and London a 
suggestion of towers in the distance, purple and indistinct. 
Although the dispatches had long preceded him to England and he must have been expected, Laurence 
was not called to the office until the next morning. Even then he was kept waiting outside Admiral 
Powys’s office for nearly two hours. At last the door opened; stepping inside, he could not help glancing 
curiously from Admiral Powys to Admiral Bowden, who was sitting to the right of the desk. The precise 
words had not been intelligible out in the hall, but he could not have avoided overhearing the loud 
voices, and Bowden was still red-faced and frowning. 
“Yes, Captain Laurence, do come in,” Powys said, waving him in with a fat-fingered hand. “How 
splendid Temeraire looks; I saw him eating this morning: already close on nine tons, I should say. You 
are to be most highly commended. And you fed him solely on fish the first two weeks, and also while on 
the transport? Remarkable, remarkable indeed; we must consider amending the general diet.” 
“Yes, yes; this is beside the point,” Bowden said impatiently. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (51 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Powys frowned at Bowden, then continued, perhaps a little too heartily, “In any case, he is certainly 
ready to begin training, and of course we must do our best to bring you up to the mark as well. Of course 
we have confirmed you in your rank; as a handler, you would be made captain anyway. But you will 
have a great deal to do; ten years’ training is not to be made up in a day.” 
Laurence bowed. “Sir, Temeraire and I are both at your service,” he said, but with reserve; he perceived 
in both men the same odd constraint about his training that Portland had displayed. Many possible 
explanations for that constraint had occurred to Laurence during the two weeks aboard the transport, 
most of them unpleasant. A boy of seven, taken from his home before his character had been truly 
formed, might easily be forced to accept treatment which a grown man would never endure, and yet of 
course the aviators themselves would consider it necessary, having gone through it themselves; 
Laurence could think of no other cause that would make them all so evasive about the subject. 
His heart sank further as Powys said, “Now then; we must send you to Loch Laggan,” for it was the 
place Portland had mentioned, and been so anxious about. “There is no denying that it is the best place 
for you,” Powys went on. “We cannot waste a moment in making you both ready for duty, and I would 
not be surprised if Temeraire were up to heavy-combat weight by the end of the summer.” 
“Sir, I beg your pardon, but I have never heard of the place, and I gather it is in Scotland?” Laurence 
asked; he hoped to draw Powys out. 
“Yes, in Inverness-shire; it is one of our largest coverts, and certainly the best for intensive training,” 
Powys said. “Lieutenant Greene outside will show you the way, and mark a covert along the route for 
you to spend the night; I am sure you will have no difficulty in reaching the place.” 
It was clearly a dismissal, and Laurence knew he could not make any further inquiry. In any event, he 
had a more pressing request. “I will speak to him, sir,” he said. “But if you have no objection, I would be 
glad to stop the night at my family home in Nottinghamshire; there is room enough for Temeraire, and 
deer for him to eat.” His parents would be in town at this time of year, but the Galmans often stayed in 
the country, and there might be some chance of seeing Edith, if only briefly. 
“Oh, certainly, by all means,” Powys said. “I am sorry I cannot give you a longer furlough; you have 
certainly deserved it, but I do not think we can spare the time: a week might make all the difference in 
the world.” 
“Thank you, sir, I perfectly understand,” Laurence said, and so bowed and departed. 
Armed by Lieutenant Greene with an excellent map showing the route, Laurence began his preparations 
at once. He had taken some time in Dover to acquire a collection of light bandboxes; he thought that 
their cylindrical shape might better lie against Temeraire’s body, and now he transferred his belongings 
into them. He knew he made an unusual sight, carrying a dozen boxes more suitable for ladies’ hats out 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (52 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
to Temeraire, but when he had strapped them down against Temeraire’s belly and seen how little they 
added to his profile, he could not help feeling somewhat smug. 
“They are quite comfortable; I do not notice them at all,” Temeraire assured him, rearing up on his back 
legs and flapping to make certain they were well seated, just as Laetificat had done back in Madeira. 
“Can we not get one of those tents? It would be much more comfortable for you to ride out of the wind.” 
“I have no idea how to put it up, though, my dear,” Laurence said, smiling at the concern. “But I will do 
well enough; with this leather coat they have given me, I will be quite warm.” 
“It must wait until you have your proper harness, in any case; the tents require locking carabiners. 
Nearly ready to go, then, Laurence?” Bowden had come upon them and interjected himself into the 
conversation without any notice. He joined Laurence standing before Temeraire’s chest and stooped a 
little to examine the bandboxes. “Hm, I see you are bent on turning all our customs upside down to suit 
yourself.” 
“No, sir, I hope not,” Laurence said, keeping his temper; it could not serve to alienate the man, for he 
was one of the senior commanders of the Corps, and might well have a say in what postings Temeraire 
received. “But my sea-chest was awkward for him to bear, and these seemed the best replacement I 
could manage on short notice.” 
“They may do,” Bowden said, straightening up. “I hope you have as easy a time putting aside the rest of 
your naval thinking as your sea-chest, Laurence; you must be an aviator now.” 
“I am an aviator, sir, and willingly so,” Laurence said. “But I cannot pretend that I intend to put aside the 
habits and mode of thinking formed over a lifetime; whether I intended it or no, I doubt it would even be 
possible.” 
Bowden fortunately took this without anger, but he shook his head. “No, it would not. And so I told—
well. I have come to make something clear: you will oblige me by refraining from discussing, with those 
not in the Corps, any aspects of your training. His Majesty sees fit to give us our heads to achieve the 
best performance of our duty; we do not care to entertain the opinions of outsiders. Do I make myself 
clear?” 
“Perfectly,” Laurence said grimly; the peculiar command bore out all his worst suspicions. But if none 
of them would come out and make themselves plain, he could hardly make an objection; it was 
infuriating. “Sir,” he said, making up his mind to try again to draw out the truth, “if you would be so 
good as to tell me what makes the covert in Scotland more suitable than this for my training, I would be 
grateful to know what to expect.” 
“You have been ordered to go there; that makes it the only suitable place,” Bowden said sharply. Yet 
then he seemed to relent, for he added, in a less harsh tone, “Laggan’s training master is especially adept

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
at bringing inexperienced handlers along quickly.” 
“Inexperienced?” Laurence said, blankly. “I thought an aviator had to come into the service at the age of 
seven; surely you do not mean that there are boys already handling dragons at that age.” 
“No, of course not,” Bowden said. “But you are not the first handler to come from outside the ranks, or 
without as much training as we might care for. Occasionally a hatchling will have a fit of distemper, and 
we must take anyone we can get it to accept.” He gave a sudden snorting laugh. “Dragons are strange 
creatures, and there is no understanding them; some of them even take a liking to sea-officers.” He 
slapped Temeraire’s side, and left as abruptly as he had come; without a word of parting, but in 
apparently better humor, and leaving Laurence hardly less perplexed than before. 
  
The flight to Nottinghamshire took several hours, and afforded him more leisure than he liked to 
consider what awaited him in Scotland. He did not like to imagine what Bowden and Powys and 
Portland all expected him to disapprove so heartily, and he still less liked to try to imagine what he 
should do if he found the situation unbearable. 
He had only once had a truly unhappy experience in his naval service: as a freshly made lieutenant of 
seventeen he had been assigned to the Shorewise, under Captain Barstowe, an older man and a relic of 
an older Navy, where officers had not been required to be gentlemen as well. Barstowe was the 
illegitimate son of a merchant of only moderate wealth and a woman of only moderate character; he had 
gone to sea as a boy in his father’s ships and been pressed into the Navy as a foremast hand. He had 
displayed great courage in battle and a keen head for mathematics, which had won him promotion first 
to master’s-mate, then to lieutenant, and even by a stroke of luck to post-rank, but he had never lost any 
of the coarseness of his background. 
What was worse, Barstowe had been conscious of his own lack of social graces, and resentful of those 
who, in his mind, made him feel that lack. It was not an unmerited resentment: there were many officers 
who looked askance and murmured at him; but he had seen in Laurence’s easy and pleasing manners a 
deliberate insult, and he had been merciless in punishing Laurence for them. Barstowe’s death of 
pneumonia three months into the voyage had possibly saved Laurence’s own life, and at the least had 
freed him from an endless daze of standing double or triple watches, a diet of ship’s biscuit and water, 
and the perils of leading a gun-crew composed of the worst and most unhandy men aboard. 
Laurence still had an instinctive horror when he thought of the experience; he was not in the least 
prepared to be ruled over by another such man, and in Bowden’s ominous words about the Corps taking 
anyone a hatchling would accept, he read a hint that his trainer or perhaps his fellow trainees would be 
of such a stamp. And while Laurence was not a boy of seventeen anymore, nor in so powerless a 
position, he now had Temeraire to consider, and their shared duty. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (54 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
His hands tightened on the reins involuntarily, and Temeraire looked around. “Are you well, Laurence?” 
he asked. “You have been so quiet.” 
“Forgive me, I have only been woolgathering,” Laurence said, patting Temeraire’s neck. “It is nothing. 
Are you tiring at all? Should you like to stop and rest awhile?” 
“No, I am not tired, but you are not telling the truth: I can hear you are unhappy,” Temeraire said 
anxiously. “Is it not good that we are going to begin training? Or are you missing your ship?” 
“I find I am become transparent before you,” Laurence said ruefully. “I am not missing my ship at all, 
no, but I will admit I am a little concerned about our training. Powys and Bowden were very odd about 
the whole thing, and I am not sure what sort of reception we will meet in Scotland, or how we shall like 
it.” 
“If we do not care for it, surely we can just go away again?” Temeraire said. 
“It is not so easy; we are not at liberty, you know,” Laurence said. “I am a King’s officer, and you are a 
King’s dragon; we cannot do as we please.” 
“I have never met the King; I am not his property, like a sheep,” Temeraire said. “If I belong to anyone, 
it is you, and you to me. I am not going to stay in Scotland if you are unhappy there.” 
“Oh dear,” Laurence said; this was not the first time Temeraire had showed a distressing tendency to 
independent thought, and it seemed to only be increasing as he grew older and started to spend more of 
his time awake. Laurence was not himself particularly interested in political philosophy, and he found it 
sadly puzzling to have to work out explanations for what to him seemed natural and obvious. “It is not 
ownership, exactly; but we owe him our loyalty. Besides,” he added, “we would have a hard time of it 
keeping you fed, were the Crown not paying for your board.” 
“Cows are very nice, but I do not mind eating fish,” Temeraire said. “Perhaps we could get a large ship, 
like the transport, and go back to sea.” 
Laurence laughed at the image. “Shall I turn pirate king and go raiding in the West Indies, and fill a 
covert with gold from Spanish merchant ships for you?” He stroked Temeraire’s neck. 
“That sounds exciting,” Temeraire said, his imagination clearly caught. “Can we not?” 
“No, we are born too late; there are no real pirates anymore,” Laurence said. “The Spanish burned the 
last pirate band out of Tortuga last century; now there are only a few independent ships or dragon-crews, 
at most, and those always in danger of being brought down. And you would not truly like it, fighting 
only for greed; it is not the same as doing one’s duty for King and country, knowing that you are 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (55 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
protecting England.” 
“Does it need protecting?” Temeraire asked, looking down. “It seems all quiet, as far as I can see.” 
“Yes, because it is our business and the Navy’s to keep it so,” Laurence said. “If we did not do our work, 
the French could come across the Channel; they are there, not very far to the east, and Bonaparte has an 
army of a hundred thousand men waiting to come across the moment we let him. That is why we must 
do our duty; it is like the sailors on the Reliant, who cannot always be doing just as they like, or the ship 
will not sail.” 
In response to this, Temeraire hummed in thought, deep in his belly; Laurence could feel the sound 
reverberating through his own body. Temeraire’s pace slowed a little; he glided for a while and then beat 
back up into the air in a spiral before leveling out again, very much like a fellow pacing back and forth. 
He looked around again. “Laurence, I have been thinking: if we must go to Loch Laggan, then there is 
no decision to be made at present; and because we do not know what may be wrong there, we cannot 
think of something to do now. So you should not worry until we have arrived and seen how matters 
stand.” 
“My dear, this is excellent advice, and I will try to follow it,” Laurence said, adding, “but I am not 
certain that I can; it is difficult not to think of.” 
“You could tell me again about the Armada, and how Sir Francis Drake and Conflagratia destroyed the 
Spanish fleet,” Temeraire suggested. 
“Again?” Laurence said. “Very well; although I will begin to doubt your memory at this rate.” 
“I remember it perfectly,” Temeraire said with dignity. “But I like to hear you tell it.” 
What with Temeraire making him repeat favorite sections and asking questions about the dragons and 
ships which Laurence thought even a scholar could not have answered, the rest of the flight passed 
without giving him leisure to worry any further. Evening was far advanced by the time they finally 
closed in upon his family’s home at Wollaton Hall, and in the twilight all the many windows glowed. 
Temeraire circled over the house a few times out of curiosity, his pupils open very wide; Laurence, 
peering down himself, made a count of lit windows and realized that the house could not be empty; he 
had assumed it would be, the London Season being still in full train, but it was now too late to seek 
another berth for Temeraire. “Temeraire, there ought to be an empty paddock behind the barns, to the 
south-east there; can you see it?” 
“Yes, there is a fence around it,” Temeraire said, looking. “Shall I land there?” 
“Yes, thank you; I am afraid I must ask you to stay there, for the horses would certainly have fits if you 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (56 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
came anywhere near the stables.” 
When Temeraire had landed, Laurence climbed down and stroked his warm nose. “I will arrange for you 
to have something to eat as soon as I have spoken with my parents, if they are indeed home, but that may 
take some time,” he said apologetically. 
“You need not bring me food tonight; I ate well before we left, and I am sleepy. I will eat some of those 
deer over there in the morning,” Temeraire said, settling himself down and curling his tail around his 
legs. “You should stay inside; it is colder here than Madeira was, and I do not want you to fall sick.” 
“There is something very curious about a six-week-old creature playing nursemaid,” Laurence said, 
amused; yet even as he spoke, he could hardly believe Temeraire was so young. Temeraire had seemed 
in most respects mature straight out of the shell, and ever since hatching he had been drinking up 
knowledge of the world with such enthusiasm that the gaps in his understanding were vanishing with 
astonishing speed. Laurence no longer thought of him as a creature for whom he was responsible, but 
rather as an intimate friend, already the dearest in his life, and one to be depended upon without 
question. The training lost a little of its dread for Laurence as he looked up at the already-drowsing 
Temeraire, and Barstowe he put aside in his memory as a bugbear. Surely there could be nothing ahead 
which they could not face together. 
But his family he would have to face alone. Coming to the house from the stable side, he could see that 
his first impression from the air had been correct: the drawing room was brightly lit, and many of the 
bedrooms had candlelight in them. It was certainly a house party, despite the time of year. 
He sent a footman to let his father know he was home, and went up to his room by the back stairs to 
change. He would have liked a bath, but he thought he had to go down at once to be civil; anything else 
might smack of avoidance. He settled for washing his face and hands in the basin; he had brought his 
evening rig, fortunately. He looked strange to himself in the mirror, wearing the new bottle-green coat of 
the Corps with the gold bars upon the shoulders in place of epaulettes; it had been bought in Dover, 
having been partly made for another man and adjusted hastily while Laurence waited, but it fit well 
enough. 
More than a dozen people were assembled in the drawing room, besides his parents; the idle 
conversation died down when he entered, then resumed in hushed voices and followed him through the 
room. His mother came to meet him; her face was composed but a little fixed in its expression, and he 
could feel her tension as he bent to kiss her cheek. “I am sorry to descend on you unannounced in this 
fashion,” he said. “I did not expect to find anyone at home; I am only here for the night, and bound for 
Scotland in the morning.” 
“Oh, I am sorry to hear it, my dear, but we are very happy to have you even briefly,” she said. “Have 
you met Miss Montagu?” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (57 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
The company were mostly long-standing friends of his parents whom he did not know very well, but as 
he had suspected might be the case, their neighbors were among the party, and Edith Galman was there 
with her parents. He was not sure whether to be pleased or unhappy; he felt he ought to be glad to see 
her, and for the opportunity which would otherwise not have come for so long; yet there was a sense of a 
whispering undercurrent in the glances thrown his way by the whole company, deeply discomfiting, and 
he felt wholly unprepared to face her in so public a setting. 
Her expression as he bowed over her hand gave him no hint of her feelings: she was of a disposition not 
easily ruffled, and if she had been startled by the news of his coming, she had already recovered her 
poise. “I am glad to see you, Will,” she said, in her quiet way, and though he could not discover any 
particular warmth in her voice, he thought at least she did not seem angry or upset. 
Unfortunately, he had no immediate opportunity to exchange a private word with her; she had already 
been engaged in conversation with Bertram Woolvey, and with her customary good manners, she turned 
back once they had completed their greetings. Woolvey made him a polite nod, but did not make any 
move to yield his place. Though their parents moved in the same circles, Woolvey had not been required 
to pursue any sort of occupation, being his father’s heir, and lacking any interest in politics, he spent his 
time hunting in the country or playing for high stakes in town. Laurence found his conversation 
monotonous, and they had never become friends. 
In any event, he could not avoid paying his respects to the rest of the company; it was difficult to meet 
open stares with equanimity, and the only thing less welcome than the censure in many voices was the 
note of pity in others. By far the worst moment was coming to the table where his father was playing 
whist; Lord Allendale looked at Laurence’s coat with heavy disapproval and said nothing to his son at 
all. 
The uncomfortable silence which fell upon their corner of the room was very awkward; Laurence was 
saved by his mother, who asked him to make up a fourth in another table, and he gratefully sat down and 
immersed himself in the intricacies of the game. His table companions were older gentlemen, Lord 
Galman and two others, friends and political allies of his father; they were dedicated players and did not 
trouble him with much conversation beyond what was polite. 
He could not help glancing towards Edith from time to time, though he could not catch the sound of her 
voice. Woolvey continued to monopolize her company, and Laurence could not help but dislike seeing 
him lean so close and speak to her so intimately. Lord Galman had to gently call his attention back to the 
cards after his distraction delayed them; Laurence apologized to the table in some embarrassment and 
bent his head over his hand again. 
“You are off to Loch Laggan, I suppose?” Admiral McKinnon said, giving him a few moments in which 
to recapture the thread of play. “I lived not far from there, as a boy, and a friend of mine lived near 
Laggan village; we used to see the flights overhead.”

“Yes, sir; we are to train there,” Laurence said, making his discard; Viscount Hale, to his left, continued 
the play, and Lord Galman took the trick. 
“They are a queer lot over there; half the village goes into service, but the locals go up, the aviators 
don’t come down, except now and again to the pub to see one of the girls. Easier than at sea for that, at 
least, ha, ha!” Having made this coarse remark, McKinnon belatedly recalled his company; he glanced 
over his shoulder in some embarrassment to see if any of the ladies had overheard, and dropped the 
subject. 
Woolvey took Edith in to supper; Laurence unbalanced the table by his presence and had to sit on the far 
side, where he could have all the pain of seeing their conversation with none of the pleasure of 
participating in it. Miss Montagu, on his left, was pretty but sulky-looking, and she neglected him almost 
to the point of rudeness to speak to the gentleman on her other side, a heavy gamester whom Laurence 
knew by name and reputation rather than personally. 
To be snubbed in such a manner was a new experience for him and an unpleasant one; he knew he was 
no longer a marriageable man, but he had not expected this to have so great an impact upon his casual 
reception, and to find himself valued less than a wastrel with blown hair and mottled red cheeks was 
particularly shocking. Viscount Hale, on his right, was only interested in his food, so Laurence found 
himself sitting in almost complete silence. 
Still more unpleasantly, without conversation of his own to command his attention, Laurence could not 
help overhearing while Woolvey spoke at length and with very little accuracy on the state of the war and 
England’s readiness for invasion. Woolvey was ridiculously enthusiastic, speaking of how the militia 
would teach Bonaparte a lesson if he dared to bring across his army. Laurence was forced to fix his gaze 
upon his plate to conceal his expression. Napoleon, master of the Continent, with a hundred thousand 
men at his disposal, to be turned back by militia: pure foolishness. Of course, it was the sort of folly that 
the War Office encouraged, to preserve morale, but to see Edith listening to this speech approvingly was 
highly unpleasant. 
Laurence thought she might have kept her face turned away deliberately; certainly she made no effort to 
meet his eye. He kept his attention for the most part fixed upon his plate, eating mechanically and sunk 
into uncharacteristic silence. The meal seemed interminable; thankfully, his father rose very shortly after 
the women had left them, and on returning to the drawing room, Laurence at once took the opportunity 
to make his apologies to his mother and escape, pleading the excuse of the journey ahead. 
But one of the servants, out of breath, caught him just outside the door of his room: his father wanted to 
see him in the library. Laurence hesitated; he could send an excuse and postpone the interview, but there 
was no sense in delaying the inevitable. He went back downstairs slowly nevertheless, and left his hand 
on the door just a moment too long: but then one of the maids came by, and he could not play the 
coward anymore, so he pushed it open and went inside.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“I wonder at your coming here,” Lord Allendale said the moment the door had shut: not even the barest 
pleasantry. “I wonder at it indeed. What do you mean by it?” 
Laurence stiffened but answered quietly, “I meant only to break my journey; I am on my way to my next 
posting. I had no notion of your being here, sir, or having guests, and I am very sorry to have burst in 
upon you.” 
“I see; I suppose you imagined we would remain in London, with this news making a nine days’ wonder 
and spectacle of us? Next posting, indeed.” He surveyed Laurence’s new coat with disdain, and 
Laurence felt at once as poorly dressed and shabby as when he had suffered such inspections as a boy 
brought in fresh from playing in the gardens. “I am not going to bother reproaching you. You knew 
perfectly well what I would think of the whole matter, and it did not weigh with you: very well. You will 
oblige me, sir, by avoiding this house in future, and our residence in London, if indeed you can be 
spared from your animal husbandry long enough to set foot in the city.” 
Laurence felt a great coldness descend on him; he was very tired suddenly, and he had no heart at all to 
argue. He heard his own voice almost as if from a distance, and there was no emotion in it at all as he 
said, “Very good, sir; I shall leave at once.” He would have to take Temeraire to the commons to sleep, 
undoubtedly scaring the village herd, and buy him a few sheep out of his own pocket in the morning if 
possible or ask him to fly hungry if not; but they would manage. 
“Do not be absurd,” Lord Allendale said. “I am not disowning you; not that you do not deserve it, but I 
do not choose to enact a melodrama for the benefit of the world. You will stay the night and leave 
tomorrow, as you declared; that will do very well. I think nothing more needs to be said; you may go.” 
Laurence went back upstairs as quickly as he was able; closing the door of his bedroom behind him felt 
like allowing a burden to slip off his shoulders. He had meant to call for a bath, but he did not think he 
could bear to speak to anyone, even a maid or a footman: to be alone and quiet was everything. He 
consoled himself with the reminder that they could leave early in the morning, and he would not have to 
endure another formal meal with the company, nor exchange another word with his father, who rarely 
rose before eleven even in the country. 
He looked at his bed a moment longer; then abruptly he took an old frock coat and a worn pair of 
trousers from his wardrobe, exchanged these for his evening dress, and went outside. Temeraire was 
already asleep, curled neatly about himself, but before Laurence could slip away again, one of his eyes 
half-opened, and he lifted his wing in instinctive welcome. Laurence had taken a blanket from the 
stables; he was as warm and comfortable as he could wish, stretched upon the dragon’s broad foreleg. 
“Is all well?” Temeraire asked him softly, putting his other foreleg protectively around Laurence, 
sheltering him more closely against his breast; his wings half-rose, mantling. “Something has distressed 
you. Shall we not go at once?”

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
The thought was tempting, but there was no sense in it; he and Temeraire would both be the better for a 
quiet night and breakfast in the morning, and in any case he was not going to creep away as if ashamed. 
“No, no,” Laurence said, petting him until his wings settled again. “There is no need, I assure you; I 
have only had words with my father.” He fell silent; he could not shake the memory of the interview, his 
father’s cold dismissiveness, and his shoulders hunched. 
“Is he angry about our coming?” Temeraire asked. 
Temeraire’s quick perception and the concern in his voice were like a tonic for his weary unhappiness, 
and it made Laurence speak more freely than he meant to. “It is an old quarrel at heart,” he said. “He 
would have had me go into the Church, like my brother; he has never counted the Navy an honorable 
occupation.” 
“And is an aviator worse, then?” Temeraire said, a little too perceptive now. “Is that why you did not 
like to leave the Navy?” 
“In his eyes, perhaps, the Corps is worse, but not in mine; there is too great a compensation.” He reached 
up to stroke Temeraire’s nose; Temeraire nuzzled back affectionately. “But truly, he has never approved 
my choice of career; I had to run away from home as a boy for him to let me go to sea. I cannot allow 
his will to govern me, for I see my duty differently than he does.” 
Temeraire snorted, his warm breath coming out as small trails of smoke in the cool night air. “But he 
will not let you sleep inside?” 
“Oh, no,” Laurence said, and felt a little embarrassed to confess the weakness that had brought him out 
to seek comfort in Temeraire. “I only felt I would rather be with you, than sleep alone.” 
But Temeraire did not see anything unusual in it. “So long as you are quite warm,” he said, resettling 
himself carefully and sweeping his wings forward a little, to encircle them from the wind. 
“I am very comfortable; I beg you to have no concern,” Laurence said, stretching out upon the broad, 
firm limb, and drawing the blanket around himself. “Good night, my dear.” He was suddenly very tired, 
but with a natural physical fatigue: the bone-deep, painful weariness was gone. 
  
He woke very early, just before sunrise, as Temeraire’s belly rumbled strongly enough for the sound to 
rouse them both. “Oh, I am hungry,” Temeraire said, waking up bright-eyed, and looked eagerly over at 
the herd of deer milling nervously in the park, clustered against the far wall. 
Laurence climbed down. “I will leave you to your breakfast, and go to have my own,” he said, giving

Temeraire’s side one final pat before turning back to the house. He was in no fit state to be seen; 
fortunately, with the hour so early, the guests were not yet about, and he was able to gain his bedroom 
without any encounter which might have rendered him still more disreputable. 
He washed briskly, put on his flying dress while a manservant repacked his solitary piece of baggage, 
and went down as soon as he thought acceptable. The maids were still laying the first breakfast dishes 
out upon the sideboard, and the coffeepot had just been laid upon the table. He had hoped to avoid all 
the party, but to his surprise, Edith was at the breakfast table already, though she had never been an early 
riser. 
Her face was outwardly calm, her clothing in perfect order and her hair drawn up smoothly into a golden 
knot, but her hands betrayed her, clenched together in her lap. She had not taken any food, only a cup of 
tea, and even that sat untouched before her. “Good morning,” she said, with a brightness that rang false; 
she glanced at the servants as she spoke. “May I pour for you?” 
“Thank you,” he said, the only possible reply, and took the place next to her; she poured coffee for him 
and added half a spoonful of sugar and cream each, exactly to his tastes. They sat stiffly together, neither 
eating nor speaking, until the servants finished the preparations and left the room. 
“I hoped I might have a chance to speak with you before you left,” she said quietly, looking at him at 
last. “I am so very sorry, Will; I suppose there was no other alternative?” 
He needed a moment to understand she meant his going into harness; despite his anxieties on the subject 
of his training, he had already forgotten to view his new situation as an evil. “No, my duty was clear,” he 
said, shortly; he might have to tolerate criticism from his father on the subject, but he would not accept it 
from any other quarter. 
But in the event, Edith only nodded. “I knew as soon as I heard that it would be something of the sort,” 
she said. She bowed her head again; her hands, which had been twisting restlessly over each other, 
stilled. 
“My feelings have not altered with my circumstances,” Laurence said at last, when it was clear she 
would say nothing more. He felt he already had received his answer, by her lack of warmth, but she 
would not say, later on, that he had not been true to his word; he would let her be the one to put an end 
to their understanding. “If yours have, you need merely say a word to silence me.” Even as he made the 
offer, he could not help but feel resentment, and he could hear an unaccustomed coldness creeping into 
his voice: a strange tone for a proposal. 
She drew a quick, startled breath, and said almost fiercely, “How can you speak so?” For a moment he 
hoped again; but she went on at once to say, “Have I ever been mercenary; have I ever reproached you 
for following your chosen course, with all its attendant dangers and discomforts? If you had gone into 
the Church, you would certainly have had any number of good livings settled upon you; by now we

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
could have been comfortable together in our own home, with children, and I should not have had to 
spend so many hours in fear for you away at sea.” 
She spoke very fast, with more emotion than he was used to seeing in her, and spots of color standing 
high on her cheeks. There was a great deal of justice in her remarks; he could not fail to see it, and be 
embarrassed at his own resentment. He half-reached out his hand to her, but she was already continuing: 
“I have not complained, have I? I have waited; I have been patient; but I have been waiting for 
something better than a solitary life, far from the society of all my friends and family, with only a very 
little share of your attention. My feelings are just as they have always been, but I am not so reckless or 
sentimental as to rely on feeling alone to ensure happiness in the face of every possible obstacle.” 
Here at last she stopped. “Forgive me,” Laurence said, heavy with mortification: every word seemed a 
just reproach, when he had been pleased to think himself ill-used. “I should not have spoken, Edith; I 
had better have asked your pardon for having placed you in so wretched a position.” He rose from the 
table and bowed; of course he could not stay in her company now. “I must beg you to excuse me; pray 
accept all my best wishes for your happiness.” 
But she was rising also, and shaking her head. “No, you must stay and finish your breakfast,” she said. 
“You have a long journey ahead of you; I am not hungry in the least. No, I assure you, I am going.” She 
gave him her hand and a smile that trembled very slightly. He thought she meant to make a polite 
farewell, but if that was her intention, it failed at the last moment. “Pray do not think ill of me,” she said, 
very low, and left the room as quickly as she might. 
She need not have worried; he could not. On the contrary, he felt only guilt for having felt coldly 
towards her even for a moment, and for having failed in his obligation to her. Their understanding had 
been formed between a gentleman’s daughter with a respectable dowry and a naval officer with few 
expectations but handsome prospects. He had reduced his standing through his own actions, and he 
could not deny that nearly all the world would have disagreed with his own assessment of his duty in the 
matter. 
And she was not unreasonable in asking more than an aviator could give. Laurence had only to think of 
the degree of his attention and affection which Temeraire commanded to realize he could have very little 
left to offer a wife, even on those rare occasions when he would be at liberty. He had been selfish in 
making the offer, asking her to sacrifice her own happiness to his comfort. 
He had very little heart or appetite left for his breakfast, but he did not want to stop along his way; he 
filled his plate and forced himself to eat. He was not left in solitude long; only a little while after Edith 
had gone, Miss Montagu came downstairs, dressed in a too-elegant riding habit, something more 
suitable for a sedate canter through London than a country ride, which nevertheless showed her figure to 
great advantage. She was smiling as she came into the room, which expression turned instantly to a 
frown to see him the only one there, and she took a seat at the far end of the table. Woolvey shortly 
joined her, likewise dressed for riding; Laurence nodded to them both with bare civility and paid no

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
attention to their idle conversation. 
Just as he was finishing, his mother came down, showing signs of hurried dressing and lines of fatigue 
around her eyes; she looked into his face anxiously. He smiled at her, hoping to reassure, but he could 
see he was not very successful: his unhappiness and the reserve with which he had armored himself 
against his father’s disapproval and the curiosity of the general company was visible in his face, with all 
he could do. 
“I must be going shortly; will you come and meet Temeraire?” he asked her, thinking they might have a 
private few minutes walking, at least. 
“Temeraire?” Lady Allendale said blankly. “William, you do not mean you have your dragon here, do 
you? Good Heavens, where is he?” 
“Certainly he is here; how else would I be traveling? I left him outside behind the stables, in the old 
yearling paddock,” Laurence said. “He will have eaten by now; I told him to make free of the deer.” 
“Oh!” said Miss Montagu, overhearing; curiosity evidently overcame her objections to the company of 
an aviator. “I have never seen a dragon; pray may we come? How famous!” 
It was impossible to refuse, although he would have liked to, so when he had rung for his baggage, the 
four of them went out to the field together. Temeraire was sitting up on his haunches, watching the 
morning fog gradually burn away over the countryside; against the cold grey sky he loomed very large, 
even from a considerable distance. 
Laurence stopped for a moment to pick up a bucket and rags from the stables, then led his suddenly 
reluctant party on with a certain relish at Woolvey and Miss Montagu’s dragging steps. His mother was 
not unalarmed herself, but she did not show it, save by holding Laurence’s arm a little more tightly, and 
stopping several paces back as he went to Temeraire’s side. 
Temeraire looked at the strangers with interest as he lowered his head to be washed; his chops were gory 
with the remains of the deer, and he opened his jaws to let Laurence clean away the blood from the 
corners of his mouth. There were three or four sets of antlers upon the ground. “I tried to bathe in that 
pond, but it is too shallow, and the mud came into my nose,” he told Laurence apologetically. 
“Oh, he talks!” Miss Montagu exclaimed, clinging to Woolvey’s arm; the two of them had backed away 
at the sight of the rows of gleaming white teeth: Temeraire’s incisors were already larger than a man’s 
fist, and with a serrated edge. 
Temeraire was taken aback at first; but then his pupils widened and he said, very gently, “Yes, I talk,” 
and to Laurence, “Would she perhaps like to come up on my back, and see around?” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (64 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Laurence could not repress an unworthy flash of malice. “I am sure she would; pray come forward, Miss 
Montagu, I can see you are not one of those poor-spirited creatures who are afraid of dragons.” 
“No, no,” she said palely, drawing back. “I have trespassed on Mr. Woolvey’s time enough, we must be 
going for our ride.” Woolvey stammered a few equally transparent excuses as well, and they escaped at 
once together, stumbling in their haste to be away. 
Temeraire blinked after them in mild surprise. “Oh, they were just afraid,” he said. “I thought she was 
like Volly at first. I do not understand; it is not as though they were cows, and anyway I have just eaten.” 
Laurence concealed his private sentiment of victory and drew his mother forward. “Do not be afraid at 
all, there is not the least cause,” he said to her softly. “Temeraire, this is my mother, Lady Allendale.” 
“Oh, a mother, that is special, is it not?” Temeraire said, lowering his head to look at her more closely. 
“I am honored to meet you.” 
Laurence guided her hand to Temeraire’s snout, and once she made the first tentative touch to the warm 
hide, she soon began petting the dragon with more confidence. “Why, the pleasure is mine,” she said. 
“And how soft! I would never have thought it.” 
Temeraire made a pleased low rumble at the compliment and the petting, and Laurence looked at the 
two of them with a great deal of his happiness restored; he thought how little the rest of the world should 
matter to him, when he was secure in the good opinion of those he valued most, and in the knowledge 
that he was doing his duty. “Temeraire is a Chinese Imperial,” he told his mother, with unconcealed 
pride. “One of the very rarest of all dragons: the only one in all Europe.” 
“Truly? How splendid, my dear; I do recall having heard before that Chinese dragons are quite out of the 
common way,” she said. But she still looked at him anxiously, and there was a silent question in her 
eyes. 
“Yes,” he said, trying to answer it. “I count myself very fortunate, I promise you. Perhaps we will take 
you flying someday, when we have more time,” he added. “It is quite extraordinary; there is nothing to 
compare to it.” 
“Oh, flying, indeed,” she said indignantly, yet she seemed satisfied on a deeper level. “When you know 
perfectly well I cannot even keep myself on a horse. What I should do on a dragon’s back, I am sure I do 
not know.” 
“You would be strapped on quite securely, just as I am,” Laurence said. “Temeraire is not a horse, he 
would not try to have you off.” 
Temeraire said earnestly, “Oh yes, and if you did fall off, I dare say I could catch you,” which was

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
perhaps not the most reassuring remark, but his desire to please was very obvious, and Lady Allendale 
smiled up at him anyway. 
“How very kind you are; I had no idea dragons were so well-mannered,” she said. “You will take 
prodigious care of William, will you not? He has always given me twice as much anxiety as any of my 
other children, and he is forever getting himself into scrapes.” 
Laurence was a little indignant to hear himself described so, and to have Temeraire say, “I promise you, 
I will never let him come to harm.” 
“I see I have delayed too long; shortly the two of you will have me wrapped in cotton batting and fed on 
gruel,” he said, bending to kiss her cheek. “Mother, you may write to me care of the Corps at Loch 
Laggan covert, in Scotland; we will be training there. Temeraire, will you sit up? I will sling this 
bandbox again.” 
“Perhaps you could take out that book by Duncan?” Temeraire asked, rearing up. “The Naval Trident? 
We never finished reading about the battle of the Glorious First, and you might read it to me as we go.” 
“Does he read to you?” Lady Allendale asked Temeraire, amused. 
“Yes; you see, I cannot hold them myself, for they are too small, and also I cannot turn the pages very 
well,” Temeraire said. 
“You are misunderstanding; she is only shocked to learn that I am ever to be persuaded to open a book; 
she was forever trying to make me sit to them when I was a boy,” Laurence said, rummaging in one of 
his other boxes to find the volume. “You would be quite astonished at how much of a bluestocking I am 
become, Mother; he is quite insatiable. I am ready, Temeraire.” 
She laughed and stepped back to the edge of the field as Temeraire put Laurence up, and stood watching 
them, shading her eyes with one hand, as they drove up into the air; a small figure, vanishing with every 
beat of the great wings, and then the gardens and the towers of the house rolled away behind the curve of 
a hill. 
  
Chapter 5 
 
THE SKY OVER Loch Laggan was full of low-hanging clouds, pearl grey, mirrored in the black water 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (66 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
of the lake. Spring had not yet arrived; a crust of ice and snow lay over the shore, ripples of yellow sand 
from an autumn tide still preserved beneath. The crisp cold smell of pine and fresh-cut wood rose from 
the forest. A gravel road wound up from the northern shores of the lake to the complex of the covert, and 
Temeraire turned to follow it up the low mountain. 
A quadrangle of several large wooden sheds stood together on a level clearing near the top, open in the 
front and rather like half a stable in appearance; men were working outside on metal and leather: 
obviously the ground crews, responsible for the maintenance of the aviators’ equipment. None of them 
so much as glanced up at the dragon’s shadow crossing over their workplace, as Temeraire flew on to 
the headquarters. 
The main building was a very medieval sort of fortification: four bare towers joined by thick stone walls, 
framing an enormous courtyard in the front and a squat, imposing hall that sank directly into the 
mountaintop and seemed to have grown out of it. The courtyard was almost entirely overrun. A young 
Regal Copper, twice Temeraire’s size, sprawled drowsing over the flagstones with a pair of brown-and-
purple Winchesters even smaller than Volatilus sleeping right on his back. Three mid-sized Yellow 
Reapers were in a mingled heap on the opposite side of the courtyard, their white-striped sides rising and 
falling in rhythm. 
As Laurence climbed down, he discovered the reason for the dragons’ choice of resting place: the 
flagstones were warm, as if heated from below, and Temeraire murmured happily and stretched himself 
on the stones beside the Yellow Reapers as soon as Laurence had unloaded him. 
A couple of servants had come out to meet him, and they took the baggage off his hands. He was 
directed to the back of the building, through narrow dark corridors, musty smelling, until he came out 
into another open courtyard that emerged from the mountainside and ended with no railing, dropping off 
sheer into another ice-strewn valley. Five dragons were in the air, wheeling in graceful formation like a 
flock of birds; the point-leader was a Longwing, instantly recognizable by the black-and-white ripples 
bordering its orange-tipped wings, which faded to a dusky blue along their extraordinary length. A 
couple of Yellow Reapers held the flanking positions, and the ends were anchored by a pale greenish 
Grey Copper to the left, and a silver-grey dragon spotted with blue and black patches to the right; 
Laurence could not immediately identify its breed. 
Though their wings beat in wholly different time, their relative positions hardly changed, until the 
Longwing’s signal-midwingman waved a flag; then they switched off smoothly as dancers, reversing so 
the Longwing was flying last. At some other signal Laurence did not see, they all backwinged at once, 
performing a perfect loop and coming back into the original formation. He saw at once that the 
maneuver gave the Longwing the greatest sweep over the ground during the pass while retaining the 
protection of the rest of the wing around it; naturally it was the greatest offensive threat among the 
group. 
“Nitidus, you are still dropping low in the pass; try changing to a six-beat pattern on the loop.” It was the

deep resounding voice of a dragon, coming from above; Laurence turned and saw a golden-hued dragon 
with the Reaper markings in pale green and the edges of his wings deep orange, perched on an 
outcropping to the right of the courtyard: he bore no rider and no harness, save, if it could be called so, a 
broad golden neck-ring studded with rounds of pale green jade stone. 
Laurence stared. Out in the valley, the wing repeated its looping pass. “Better,” the dragon called 
approvingly. Then he turned his head and looked down. “Captain Laurence?” he said. “Admiral Powys 
said you would be arriving; you come in good time. I am Celeritas, training master here.” He spread his 
wings for lift and leapt easily down into the courtyard. 
Laurence bowed mechanically. Celeritas was a mid-weight dragon, perhaps a quarter of the size of a 
Regal Copper; smaller even than Temeraire’s present juvenile size. “Hm,” he said, lowering his head to 
inspect Laurence closely; the deep green irises of his eyes seemed to turn and contract around the 
narrowed pupil. “Hm, well, you are a good deal older than most handlers; but that is often all to the good 
when we must hurry along a young dragon, as in Temeraire’s case I think we must.” 
He lifted his head and called out into the valley again, “Lily, remember to keep your neck straight on the 
loop.” He turned back to Laurence. “Now then. He has no special offensive capabilities showing, as I 
understand it?” 
“No, sir.” The answer and the address were automatic; tone and attitude alike both declared the dragon’s 
rank, and habit carried Laurence along through his surprise. “And Sir Edward Howe, who identified his 
species, was of the opinion that it was unlikely he should develop such, though not out of the question
—” 
“Yes, yes,” Celeritas interrupted. “I have read Sir Edward’s work; he is an expert on the Oriental breeds, 
and I would trust his judgment in the matter over my own. It is a pity, for we could well do with one of 
those Japanese poison-spitters, or waterspout-makers: now that would be useful against a French 
Flamme-de-Gloire. But heavy-combat weight, I understand?” 
“He is at present some nine tons in weight, and it is nearly six weeks since he was hatched,” Laurence 
said. 
“Good, that is very good, he ought to double that,” Celeritas said, and he rubbed the side of a claw over 
his forehead thoughtfully. “So. All is as I had heard. Good. We will be pairing Temeraire with Maximus, 
the Regal Copper currently here in training. The two of them together will serve as a loose backing arc 
for Lily’s formation—that is the Longwing there.” He gestured with his head out at the formation 
wheeling in the valley, and Laurence, still bewildered, turned to watch it for a moment. 
The dragon continued, “Of course, I must see Temeraire fly before I can determine the specific course of 
your training, but I need to finish this session, and after a long journey he will not show to advantage in 
any case. Ask Lieutenant Granby to show you about and tell you where to find the feeding grounds; you

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
will find him in the officers’ club. Come back with Temeraire tomorrow, an hour past first light.” 
This was a command; an acknowledgment was required. “Very good, sir,” Laurence said, concealing his 
stiffness in formality. Fortunately, Celeritas did not seem to notice; he was already leaping back up to 
his higher vantage point. 
Laurence was very glad that he did not know where the officers’ club was; he felt he could have used a 
quiet week to adjust his thinking, rather than the fifteen minutes it took him to find a servant who could 
point him in the right direction. Everything which he had ever heard about dragons was turned upon its 
head: that dragons were useless without their handlers; that unharnessed dragons were only good for 
breeding. He no longer wondered at all the anxiety on the part of the aviators; what would the world 
think, to know they were trained—given orders—by one of the beasts they supposedly controlled? 
Of course, considered rationally, he had long possessed proofs of dragon intelligence and independence, 
in Temeraire’s person; but these had developed gradually over time, and he had unconsciously come to 
think of Temeraire as a fully realized individual without extending the implication to the rest of 
dragonkind. The first surprise past, he could without too much difficulty accept the idea of a dragon as 
instructor, but it would certainly create a scandal of extraordinary proportions among those who had no 
similar personal experience. 
It had not been so long, only shortly before the Revolution in France had cast Europe into war again, 
since the proposal had been made by Government that unharnessed dragons ought to be killed, rather 
than supported at the public expense and kept for breeding; the rationale offered had been a lack of need 
at that present time, and that their recalcitrance likely only hurt the fighting bloodlines. Parliament had 
calculated a savings of more than ten million pounds per annum; the idea had been seriously considered, 
then dropped abruptly without public explanation. It was whispered, however, that every admiral of the 
Corps stationed in range of London had jointly descended upon the Prime Minister and informed him 
that if the law were passed, the entire Corps would mutiny. 
He had previously heard the story with disbelief; not for the proposal, but for the idea that senior officers
—any officers—would behave in such a way. The proposal had always seemed to him wrong-minded, 
but only as the sort of foolish short-sightedness so common among bureaucrats, who thought it better to 
save ten shillings on sailcloth and risk an entire ship worth six thousand pounds. Now he considered his 
own indifference with a sense of mortification. Of course they would have mutinied. 
Still preoccupied with his thoughts, he walked through the archway to the officers’ club without 
attention, and only caught the ball that hurtled at his head by reflex. A mingled cheer and cry of protest 
both went up at once. 
“That was a clear goal, he’s not on your team!” A young man, barely out of boyhood, with bright yellow 
hair, was complaining.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Nonsense, Martin. Certainly he is; aren’t you?” Another of the participants, grinning broadly, came up 
to Laurence to take the ball; he was a tall, lanky fellow, with dark hair and sunburnt cheekbones. 
“Apparently so,” Laurence said, amused, handing over the ball. He was a little astonished to find a 
collection of officers playing children’s games indoors, and in such disarray. In his possession of coat 
and neckcloth, he was more formally dressed than all of them; a couple had even taken off their shirts 
entirely. The furniture had been pushed pell-mell into the edges of the room, and the carpet rolled up and 
thrust into a corner. 
“Lieutenant John Granby, unassigned,” the dark-haired man said. “Have you just arrived?” 
“Yes; Captain Will Laurence, on Temeraire,” Laurence said, and was startled and not a little dismayed 
to see the smile fall off Granby’s face, the open friendliness vanishing at once. 
“The Imperial!” The cry was almost general, and half the boys and men in the room disappeared past 
them, pelting towards the courtyard. Laurence, taken aback, blinked after them. 
“Don’t worry!” The yellow-haired young man, coming up to introduce himself, answered his look of 
alarm. “We all know better than to pester a dragon; they’re only going to have a look. Though you might 
have some trouble with the cadets; we have a round two dozen of ’em here, and they make it their 
mission to plague the life out of everyone. Midwingman Ezekiah Martin, and you can forget my first 
name now that you have it, if you please.” 
Informality was so obviously the usual mode among them that Laurence could hardly take offense, 
though it was not in the least what he was used to. “Thank you for the warning; I will see Temeraire 
does not let them bother him,” he said. He was relieved to see no sign of Granby’s attitude of dislike in 
Martin’s greeting, and wished he might ask the friendlier of the two for guidance. However, he did not 
mean to disobey orders, even if given by a dragon, so he turned to Granby and said formally, “Celeritas 
tells me to ask you to show me about; will you be so good?” 
“Certainly,” Granby said, trying for equal formality; but it sat less naturally on him, and he sounded 
artificial and wooden. “Come this way, if you please.” 
Laurence was pleased when Martin fell in with them as Granby led the way upstairs; the midwingman’s 
light conversation, which did not falter for an instant, made the atmosphere a great deal less 
uncomfortable. “So you are the naval fellow who snatched an Imperial out of the jaws of France. Lord, it 
is a famous story; the Frogs must be gnashing their teeth and tearing their hair over it,” Martin said 
exultantly. “I hear you took the egg off an hundred-gun ship; was the battle very long?” 
“I am afraid rumor has magnified my accomplishments,” Laurence said. “The Amitié was not a first-rate 
at all, but a thirty-six, a frigate; and her men were nearly falling down for thirst. Her captain offered a 
very valiant defense, but it was not a very great contest; ill fortune and the weather did our work for us. I

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
can claim only to have been lucky.” 
“Oh! Well, luck is nothing to sneeze at, either; we would not get very far if luck were against us,” 
Martin said. “Hullo, have they put you at the corner? You will have the wind howling at all hours.” 
Laurence came into the circular tower room and looked around his new accommodation with pleasure; 
to a man used to the confines of a ship’s cabin, it seemed spacious, and the large, curved windows a 
great luxury. They looked out over the lake, where a thin grey drizzle had started; when he opened them, 
a cool wet smell came blowing in, not unlike the sea, except for the lack of salt. 
His bandboxes were piled a little haphazardly together beside the wardrobe; he looked inside this with 
some concern, but his things had been put away neatly enough. A writing desk and chair completed the 
furnishings, beside the plain but ample bed. “It seems perfectly quiet to me; I am sure it will do nicely,” 
he said, unbuckling his sword and laying it upon the bed; he did not feel comfortable taking off his coat, 
but he could at least reduce the formality of his appearance a little by this measure. 
“Shall I show you to the feeding grounds now?” Granby said stiffly; it was his first contribution to the 
conversation since they had left the club. 
“Oh, we ought to show him the baths first, and the dining hall,” Martin said. “The baths are something to 
see,” he added to Laurence. “They were built by the Romans, you know; and they are why we are all 
here at all.” 
“Thank you; I would be glad to see them,” Laurence said; although he would have been happy to let the 
obviously unwilling lieutenant escape, he could not say otherwise now without being rude; Granby 
might be discourteous, but Laurence did not intend to stoop to the same behavior. 
They passed the dining hall on the way; Martin, chattering away, told him that the captains and 
lieutenants dined at the smaller round table, then midwingmen and ensigns at the long rectangle. 
“Thankfully, the cadets come in and eat earlier, for the rest of us would starve if we had to hear them 
squalling throughout our meals, and then the ground crews eat after us,” he finished. 
“Do you never take your meals separately?” Laurence asked; the communal dining was rather odd, for 
officers, and he thought wistfully that he would miss being able to invite friends to his own table; it had 
been one of his greatest pleasures, ever since he had won enough in prize-money to afford it. 
“Of course, if someone is sick, a tray will be sent up,” Martin said. “Oh, are you hungry? I suppose you 
had no dinner. Hi, Tolly,” he called, and a servant crossing the room with a stack of linens turned to look 
at them, an eyebrow raised. “This is Captain Laurence; he has just flown in. Can you manage something 
for him, or must he wait until supper?” 
“No, thank you; I am not hungry. I was speaking only from curiosity,” Laurence said. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (71 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Oh, there’s no trouble about it,” the man Tolly said, answering directly. “I dare say one of the cooks 
can cut you a fair slice or two and dish up some potatoes; I will ask Nan. Tower room on the third floor, 
yes?” He nodded and went on his way without even waiting for a reply. 
“There, Tolly will take care of you,” Martin said, evidently without the least consciousness of anything 
out of the ordinary. “He is one of the best fellows; Jenkins is never willing to oblige, and Marvell will 
get it done, but he will moan about it so that you wish you hadn’t asked.” 
“I imagine that you have difficulty finding servants who are not bothered by the dragons,” Laurence 
said; he was beginning to adjust to the informality of the aviators’ address among themselves, but to find 
a similar degree in a servant had bemused him afresh. 
“Oh, they are all born and bred in the villages hereabouts, so they are used to it and us,” Martin said, as 
they walked through the long hall. “I suppose Tolly has been working here since he was a squeaker; he 
would not bat an eye at a Regal Copper in a tantrum.” 
A metal door closed off the stairway leading down to the baths; when Granby pulled it open, a gust of 
hot, wet air came out and steamed in the relative cold of the corridor. Laurence followed the other two 
down the narrow, spiraling stair; it went down for four turns and opened abruptly into a large bare room, 
with shelves of stone built out of the walls and faded paintings upon the walls, partly chipped away: 
obvious relics of Roman times. One side held heaps of folded and stacked linens, the other a few piles of 
discarded clothes. 
“Just leave your things on the shelves,” Martin said. “The baths are in a circuit, so we come back out 
here again.” He and Granby were already stripping. 
“Have we time to bathe now?” Laurence asked, a little dubiously. 
Martin paused in taking off his boots. “Oh, I thought we would just stroll through; no, Granby? It is not 
as though there is a need to rush; supper will not be for a few hours yet.” 
“Unless you have something urgent to attend to,” Granby said to Laurence, so ungraciously that Martin 
looked between them in surprise, as if only now noticing the tension. 
Laurence compressed his lips and held back a sharp word; he could not be checking every aviator who 
might be hostile to a Navy man, and to some extent he understood the resentment. He would have to win 
through it, just like a new midwingman fresh on board. “Not in the least” was all he said. Though he was 
not sure why they had to strip down merely to tour the baths, he followed their example, save that he 
arranged his clothes with more care into two neat stacks, and laid his coat atop them rather than creasing 
it by folding.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Then they left the room by a corridor to the left, and passed through another metal door at its end. He 
saw the sense in undressing as soon as they were through: the room beyond was so full of steam he 
could barely see past arm’s length, and he was dripping wet instantly. If he had been dressed, his coat 
and boots would have been ruined, and everything else soaked through; on naked skin the steam was 
luxurious, just shy of being too hot, and his muscles unwound gratefully from the long flight. 
The room was tiled, with benches built out of the walls at regular intervals; a few other fellows were 
lying about in the steam. Granby and Martin nodded to a couple of them as they led the way through and 
into a cavernous room beyond; this one was even warmer, but dry, and a long, shallow pool ran very 
nearly its full length. “We are right under the courtyard now, and there is why the Corps has this place,” 
Martin said, pointing. 
Deep niches were built into the long wall at regular intervals, and a fence of wrought-iron barred them 
from the rest of the room while leaving them visible. Perhaps half the niches were empty; the other half 
were padded with fabric, and each held a single massive egg. “They must be kept warm, you see, since 
we cannot spare the dragons to brood over them, or let them bury them near volcanoes or suchlike, as 
they would in nature.” 
“And there is no space to make a separate chamber for them?” Laurence said, surprised. 
“Of course there is space,” Granby said rudely; Martin glanced at him and leapt in hastily, before 
Laurence could react. 
“You see, everyone is in and out of here often, so if one of them begins to look a bit hard we are more 
likely to notice it,” he said hurriedly. 
Still trying to rein in his temper, Laurence let Granby’s remark pass and nodded to Martin; he had read 
in Sir Edward’s books how unpredictable dragon egg hatching was, until the very end; even knowing the 
species could only narrow the process down to a span of months or, for the larger breeds, years. 
“We think the Anglewing over there may hatch soon; that would be famous,” Martin went on, pointing 
at a golden-brown egg, its sides faintly pearlescent and spotted with flecks of brighter yellow. “That is 
Obversaria’s get; she is the flag-dragon at the Channel. I was signal-ensign aboard her, fresh out of 
training, and no beast in her class can touch her for maneuvering.” 
Both of the aviators looked at the eggs with wistful expressions, longingly; of course each of those 
represented a rare chance of promotion, and one even more uncertain than the favor of the Admiralty, 
which might be courted or won by valor in the field. “Have you served with many dragons?” Laurence 
asked Martin. 
“Only Obversaria and then Inlacrimas; he was injured in a skirmish over the Channel a month ago, and 
so here I am on the ground,” Martin said. “But he will be fit for duty again in a month, and I got a

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
promotion out of it, so I shouldn’t complain; I am just made midwingman,” he added proudly. “And 
Granby here has been with more; four, is that not right? Who before Laetificat?” 
“Excursius, Fluitare, and Actionis,” Granby answered, very briefly. 
But the first name had been enough; Laurence finally understood, and his face hardened. The fellow 
likely was friend to Lieutenant Dayes; at any rate, the two of them had been the equivalent of shipmates 
until recently, and it was now clear to him that Granby’s offensive behavior was not simply the general 
resentment of an aviator for a naval officer shoehorned into his service, but also a personal matter, and 
thus in some sense an extension of Dayes’s original insult. 
Laurence was far less inclined to tolerate any slight for such a cause, and he said abruptly, “Let us 
continue, gentlemen.” He allowed no further delays during the remainder of the tour, and let Martin 
carry the conversation as he would, without giving any response that might draw it out. They came back 
to the dressing room after completing the circuit of the baths, and once dressed again, Laurence said 
quietly but firmly, “Mr. Granby, you will take me to the feeding grounds now; then I may set you at 
liberty.” He had to make it clear to the man that the disrespect would not be tolerated; if Granby were to 
make another fling, he would have to be checked, and better by far were that to occur in private. “Mr. 
Martin, I am obliged to you for your company, and your explanations; they have been most valuable.” 
“You are very welcome,” Martin said, looking between Laurence and Granby uncertainly, as if afraid of 
what might happen if he left them alone. But Laurence had made his hint quite unmistakable, and 
despite the informality Martin seemed able to see that it had nearly the weight of an order. “I will see 
you both at supper, I imagine; until then.” 
In silence Laurence continued with Granby to the feeding grounds, or rather to a ledge that overlooked 
them, at the far end of the training valley. The mouth of a natural cul-de-sac was visible at the far end of 
the valley, and Laurence could see several herdsmen there on duty; Granby explained, in a flat voice, 
that when signaled from the ledge, these would pick out the appropriate number of beasts for a dragon 
and send them into the valley, where the dragon might hunt them down and eat, so long as no training 
flight was in progress. 
“It is straightforward enough, I trust,” Granby said, in conclusion; his tone was highly disagreeable, and 
yet another step over the line, as Laurence had feared. 
“Sir,” Laurence said quietly. Granby blinked in momentary confusion, and Laurence repeated, “It is 
straightforward enough, sir.” 
He hoped it would be enough to warn Granby off from further disrespect, but almost unbelievably, the 
lieutenant answered back, saying, “We do not stand on ceremony here, whatever you may have been 
used to in the Navy.” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (74 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“I have been used to courtesy; where I do not receive it, I will insist at the least on the respect due to 
rank,” Laurence said, his temper breaking loose; he glared savagely at Granby, and felt the color coming 
into his face. “You will amend your address immediately, Lieutenant Granby, or by God I shall have 
you broken for insubordination; I do not imagine that the Corps takes quite so light a view of it as one 
might gather from your behavior.” 
Granby went very pale; the sunburn across his cheeks stood out red. “Yes, sir,” he said, and stood 
sharply at attention. 
“Dismissed, Lieutenant,” Laurence said at once, and turned away to gaze out over the field with arms 
clasped behind his back until Granby had left; he did not want to even look at the fellow again. With the 
sustaining flush of righteous anger gone, he was tired, and miserable to have met with such treatment; in 
addition he now had to anticipate with dismay the consequences he knew would follow on his having 
checked the man. Granby had seemed on their first instant of meeting to be friendly and likable by 
nature; even if he were not, he was still one of the aviators, and Laurence an interloper. Granby’s fellows 
would naturally support him, and their hostility could only make Laurence’s circumstances unpleasant. 
But there had been no alternative; open disrespect could not be borne, and Granby had known very well 
that his behavior was beyond the pale. Laurence was still downcast when he turned back inside; his 
spirits rose only as he walked into the courtyard and found Temeraire awake and waiting for him. “I am 
sorry to have abandoned you so long,” Laurence said, leaning against his side and petting him, more for 
his own comfort than Temeraire’s. “Have you been very bored?” 
“No, not at all,” Temeraire said. “There were a great many people who came by and spoke to me; some 
of them measured me for a new harness. Also, I have been talking to Maximus here, and he tells me we 
are to train together.” 
Laurence nodded a greeting to the Regal Copper, who had acknowledged the mention of his name by 
opening a sleepy eye; Maximus lifted his massive head enough to return the gesture, and then sank back 
down. “Are you hungry?” Laurence asked, turning back to Temeraire. “We must be up early to fly for 
Celeritas—that is the training master here,” he added, “so you will likely not have time in the morning.” 
“Yes, I would like to eat,” Temeraire said; he seemed wholly unsurprised to have a dragon as training 
master, and in the face of his pragmatic response, Laurence felt a little silly for his own first shock; of 
course Temeraire would see nothing strange in it. 
Laurence did not bother strapping himself back on completely for the short hop to the ledge, and there 
he dismounted to let Temeraire hunt without a passenger. The uncomplicated pleasure of watching the 
dragon soar and dive so gracefully did a great deal to ease Laurence’s mind. No matter how the aviators 
should respond to him, his position was secure in a way that no sea captain could hope for; he had 
experience in managing unwilling men, if it came to that in his crew, and at least Martin’s example 
showed that not all the officers would be prejudiced against him from the beginning.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
There was some other comfort also: as Temeraire swooped and snatched a lumbering shaggy-haired cow 
neatly off the ground and settled down to eat it, Laurence heard enthusiastic murmuring and looked up 
to see a row of small heads poking out of the windows above. “That is the Imperial, sir, is he not?” one 
of the boys, sandy-haired and round-faced, called out to him. 
“Yes, that is Temeraire,” Laurence answered. He had always made an effort towards the education of his 
young gentlemen, and his ship had been considered a prime place for a squeaker; he had many family 
and service friends to do favors for, so he had fairly extensive experience of boys, most of it favorable. 
Unlike many grown men, he was not at all uncomfortable in their company, even if these were younger 
than most of his midshipmen ever had been. 
“Look, look, how smashing,” another one, smaller and darker, cried and pointed; Temeraire was 
skimming low to the ground and collecting up all three sheep that had been released for him, before 
stopping to eat again. 
“I dare say you all have more experience of dragonflight than I; does he show to advantage?” he asked 
them. 
“Oh, yes,” was the general and enthusiastic response. “Corners on a wink and a nod,” the sandy-haired 
boy said, adopting a professional tone, “and splendid extension; not a wasted wingbeat. Oh, ripping,” he 
added, dissolving back into a small boy, as Temeraire backwinged to take the last cow. 
“Sir, you haven’t picked your runners yet, have you?” another dark-haired one asked hopefully, which at 
once set up a clamor among all the others; all of them announcing their worthiness for what Laurence 
gathered was some position to which particularly favored cadets were assigned, in a dragon-crew. 
“No; and I imagine when I do it will be on the advice of your instructors,” he said, with mock severity. 
“So I dare say you ought to mind them properly the next few weeks. There, have you had enough?” he 
asked, as Temeraire rejoined him on the ledge, landing directly on the edge with perfect balance. 
“Oh yes, they were very tasty; but now I am all over blood, may we go and wash up?” Temeraire said. 
Laurence realized belatedly this had been omitted from his tour; he glanced up at the children. 
“Gentlemen, I must ask you for direction; shall I take him to the lake for bathing?” 
They all stared down at him with round surprised eyes. “I have never heard of bathing a dragon,” one of 
them said. 
The sandy-haired one added, “I mean, can you imagine trying to wash a Regal? It would take ages. 
Usually they lick their chops and talons clean, like a cat.” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (76 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“That does not sound very pleasant; I like being washed, even if it is a great deal of work,” Temeraire 
said, looking at Laurence anxiously. 
Laurence suppressed an exclamation and said equably, “Certainly it is a great deal of work, but so are 
many other things that ought to be done; we shall go to the lake at once. Only wait here a moment, 
Temeraire; I will go and fetch some linens.” 
“Oh, I will bring you some!” The sandy-haired boy vanished from the windows; the rest immediately 
followed, and scarcely five minutes later the whole half a dozen of them had come spilling out onto the 
ledge with a pile of imperfectly folded linens whose provenance Laurence suspected. 
He took them anyway, thanking the boys gravely, and climbed back aboard, making a mental note of the 
sandy-haired fellow; it was the sort of initiative he liked to see and considered the making of an officer. 
“We could bring our carabiner belts tomorrow, and then we could ride along and help,” the boy added 
now, with a too-guileless expression. 
Laurence eyed him and wondered if this was forwardness to discourage, but he was secretly cheered by 
the enthusiasm, so he contented himself with saying firmly, “We shall see.” 
They stood watching from the ledge, and Laurence saw their eager faces until Temeraire came around 
the castle and they passed out of sight. Once at the lake, he let Temeraire swim about to clean off the 
worst of the gore, then wiped him down with particular care. It was appalling to a man raised to daily 
holystoning of the deck that aviators should leave their beasts to keep themselves clean, and as he 
rubbed down the sleek black sides, he suddenly considered the harness. “Temeraire, does this chafe you 
at all?” he asked, touching the straps. 
“Oh, not very often now,” Temeraire said, turning his head to look. “My hide is getting a great deal 
tougher; and when it does bother me I can shift it a little, and then it is better straightaway.” 
“My dear, I am covered with shame,” Laurence said. “I ought never have kept you in it; from now on 
you shall not wear it for an instant while it is not necessary for our flying together.” 
“But is it not required, like your clothing?” Temeraire said. “I would not like anyone to think I was not 
civilized.” 
“I shall get you a larger chain to wear about your neck, and that will serve,” Laurence said, thinking of 
the golden collar Celeritas wore. “I am not going to have you suffering for a custom that so far as I can 
tell is nothing but laziness; and I am of a mind to complain of it in the strongest terms to the next 
admiral I see.” 
He was as good as his word and stripped the harness from Temeraire the moment they landed in the

courtyard. Temeraire looked a little nervously at the other dragons, who had been watching with interest 
from the moment the two of them had returned with Temeraire still dripping from the lake. But none of 
them seemed shocked, only curious, and once Laurence had detached the gold-and-pearl chain and 
wrapped it around one of Temeraire’s talons, rather like a ring, Temeraire relaxed entirely and settled 
back down on the warm flagstones. “It is more pleasant not to have it on; I had not realized how it would 
be,” he confided quietly to Laurence, and scratched at a darkened spot on his hide where a buckle had 
rested and crushed together several scales into a callus. 
Laurence paused in cleaning the harness and stroked him in apology. “I do beg your forgiveness,” he 
said, looking at the galled spot with remorse. “I will try and find a poultice for these marks.” 
“I want mine off, too,” chirped one of the Winchesters suddenly, and flitted down from Maximus’s back 
to land in front of Laurence. “Will you, please?” 
Laurence hesitated; it did not seem right to him to handle another man’s beast. “I think perhaps your 
own handler is the only one who ought to remove it,” he said. “I do not like to give offense.” 
“He has not come for three days,” the Winchester said sadly, his small head drooping; he was only about 
the size of a couple of draft horses, and his shoulder barely topped Laurence’s head. Looking more 
closely, Laurence could see his hide was marked with streaks of dried blood, and the harness did not 
look particularly clean or well-kept, unlike those of the other dragons; it bore stains and rough patches. 
“Come here, and let me have a look at you,” Laurence said quietly, as he took up the linens, still wet 
from the lake, and began to clean the little dragon. 
“Oh, thank you,” the Winchester said, leaning happily into the cloth. “My name is Levitas,” he added 
shyly. 
“I am Laurence, and this is Temeraire,” Laurence said. 
“Laurence is my captain,” Temeraire said, the smallest hint of belligerence in his tone, and an emphasis 
on the possessive; Laurence looked up at him in surprise, and paused in his cleaning to pat Temeraire’s 
side. Temeraire subsided, but watched with his pupils narrowed to thin slits while Laurence finished. 
“Shall I see if I cannot find what has happened to your handler?” he told Levitas with a final pat. 
“Perhaps he is not feeling well, but if so I am sure he will be well soon.” 
“Oh, I do not think he is sick,” Levitas said, with that same sadness. “But that feels much better 
already,” he added, and rubbed his head gratefully against Laurence’s shoulder. 
Temeraire gave a low displeased rumble and flexed his talons against the stone; with an alarmed chirp, 
Levitas flew straightaway up to Maximus’s back and nestled down small against the other Winchester

again. Laurence turned to Temeraire. “Come now, what is this jealousy?” he said softly. “Surely you 
cannot begrudge him a little cleaning when his handler is neglecting him.” 
“You are mine,” Temeraire said obstinately. After a moment, however, he ducked his head in a 
shamefaced way and added in a smaller voice, “He would be easier to clean.” 
“I would not give up an inch of your hide were you twice Laetificat’s size,” Laurence said. “But perhaps 
I will see if some of the boys would like to wash him, tomorrow.” 
“Oh, that would be good,” Temeraire said, brightening. “I do not quite understand why his handler has 
not come; you would never stay away so long, would you?” 
“Never in life, unless I was kept away by force,” Laurence said. He did not understand it himself; he 
could imagine that a man harnessed to a dim beast would not necessarily find the creature’s company 
satisfying intellectually, but at the least he would have expected the easy affection with which he had 
seen James treat Volatilus. And though even smaller, Levitas was certainly more intelligent than Volly. 
Perhaps it was not so strange that there would be less dedicated men among aviators as well as in any 
other branch of the service, but with the shortage of dragons, it seemed a great pity to see one of them 
reduced to unhappiness, which could not help but affect the creature’s performance. 
Laurence carried Temeraire’s harness with him out of the castle yard and over to the large sheds where 
the ground crews worked; though it was late in the day, there were several men still sitting out in front, 
smoking comfortably. They looked at him curiously, not saluting, but not unfriendly, either. “Ah, you’d 
be Temeraire’s,” one of them said, reaching out to take the harness. “Has it broken? We’ll be having a 
proper harness ready for you in a few days, but we can patch it up in the meantime.” 
“No, it merely needs cleaning,” Laurence said. 
“You haven’t a harness-tender yet; we can’t be assigning you your ground crew till we know how he’s 
to be trained,” the man said. “But we’ll see to it; Hollin, give this a rub, would you?” he called, catching 
the attention of a younger man who was working on a bit of leatherwork inside. 
Hollin came out, wiping grease off onto his apron, and took the harness in big, capable-looking hands. 
“Right you are; will he give me any trouble, putting it back on him after?” he asked. 
“That will not be necessary, thank you; he is more comfortable without it, so merely leave it beside 
him,” Laurence said firmly, ignoring the looks this won him. “And Levitas’s harness requires attention 
as well.” 
“Levitas? Well now, I’d say that’s for his captain to speak to his crew about,” the first man said, sucking 
on his pipe thoughtfully. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (79 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
That was perfectly true; nevertheless, it was a poor-spirited answer. Laurence gave the man a cold, 
steady look, and let silence speak for him. The men shifted a little uncomfortably under his glare. He 
said, very softly, “If they need to be rebuked to do their duty, then it must be arranged; I would not have 
thought any man in the Corps would need to hear anything but that a dragon’s well-being was at risk to 
seek to amend the situation.” 
“I’ll do it along of dropping off Temeraire’s,” Hollin said hurriedly. “I don’t mind; he’s so small it won’t 
take me but a few shakes.” 
“Thank you, Mr. Hollin; I am glad to see I was not mistaken,” Laurence said, and turned back to the 
castle; he heard the murmur behind him of “Regular Tartar, he is; wouldn’t fancy being on his crew.” It 
was not a pleasant thing to hear, at all; he had never been considered a hard captain, and he had always 
prided himself on ruling his men by respect rather than fear or a heavy hand; many of his crew had been 
volunteers. 
He was conscious, too, of guilt: by speaking so strongly, he had indeed gone over the head of Levitas’s 
captain, and the man would have every right to complain. But Laurence could not quite bring himself to 
regret it; Levitas was clearly neglected, and it in no way fit his sense of duty to leave the creature in 
discomfort. The informality of the Corps might for once be of service to him; with any luck the hint 
might not be taken as direct interference, or as truly outrageous as it would have been in the Navy. 
It had not been an auspicious first day; he was both weary and discouraged. There had been nothing 
truly unacceptable as he had feared, nothing so bad he could not bear it, but also nothing easy or 
familiar. He could not help but long for the comforting strictures of the Navy which had encompassed 
all his life, and wish impractically that he and Temeraire might be once again on the deck of the Reliant, 
with all the wide ocean around them. 
  
Chapter 6 
 
THE SUN WOKE him, streaming in through the eastern windows. The forgotten cold plate had been 
waiting for him the night before when he had finally climbed back up to his room, Tolly evidently being 
as good as his word. A couple of flies had settled on the food, but that was nothing to a seaman; 
Laurence had waved them off and devoured it to the crumbs. He had meant only to rest awhile before 
supper and a bath; now he blinked stupidly up at the ceiling for the better part of a minute before getting 
his bearings. 
Then he remembered the training; he scrambled up at once. He had slept in his shirt and breeches, but 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (80 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
fortunately he had a second of each, and his coat was reasonably fresh. He would have to remember to 
find a tailor locally where he could order another. It was a bit of a struggle to get into it alone, but he 
managed, and felt himself in good order when at last he descended. 
The senior officers’ table was nearly empty. Granby was not there, but Laurence felt the effect of his 
presence in the sideways glances the two young men sitting together at the lower end of the table gave 
him. Nearer the head of the room, a big, thickset man with a florid face and no coat on was eating 
steadily through a heaped plate of eggs and black pudding and bacon; Laurence looked around 
uncertainly for a sideboard. 
“Morning, Captain; coffee or tea?” Tolly was at his elbow, holding two pots. 
“Coffee, thank you,” Laurence said gratefully; he had the cup drained and held out for more before the 
man even turned away. “Do we serve ourselves?” he asked. 
“No, here comes Lacey with eggs and bacon for you; just mention if you like something else,” Tolly 
said, already moving on. 
The maidservant was wearing coarse homespun, and she said, “Good morning!” cheerfully instead of 
staying silent, but it was so pleasant to see a friendly face that Laurence found himself returning the 
greeting. The plate she was carrying was so hot it steamed, and he had not a fig to give for propriety 
once he had tasted the splendid bacon: cured with some unfamiliar smoke, and full of flavor, and the 
yolks of his eggs almost bright orange. He ate quickly, with an eye on the squares of light traveling 
across the floor where the sun struck through the high windows. 
“Don’t choke,” said the thickset man, eyeing him. “Tolly, more tea,” he bellowed; his voice was loud 
enough to carry through a storm. “You Laurence?” he demanded, as his cup was refilled. 
Laurence finished swallowing and said, “Yes, sir; you have the advantage of me.” 
“Berkley,” the man said. “Look here, what sort of nonsense have you been filling your dragon’s head 
with? My Maximus has been muttering all morning about wanting a bath, and his harness removed; 
absurd stuff.” 
“I do not find it so, sir, to be concerned with the comfort of my dragon,” Laurence said quietly, his 
hands tightening on the cutlery. 
Berkley glared straight back at him. “Why damn you, are you suggesting I neglect Maximus? No one 
has ever washed dragons; they don’t mind a little dirt, they have hide.” 
Laurence reined in his temper and his voice; his appetite was gone, however, and he set down knife and 
fork. “Evidently your dragon disagrees; do you suppose yourself a better judge than he of what gives 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (81 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
him discomfort?” 
Berkley scowled at him fiercely, then abruptly he snorted. “Well, you are a fire-breather, make no 
mistake; and here I thought you Navy fellows were all so stiff and cautious-like.” He drained his teacup 
and stood up from the table. “I will be seeing you later; Celeritas wants to pace Maximus and Temeraire 
out together.” He nodded, apparently in all friendliness, and left. 
Laurence was a little dazed by this abrupt reversal; then he realized he was near to being late, and he had 
no more time to think over the incident. Temeraire was waiting impatiently, and now Laurence found 
himself paying for his virtue, as the harness had to be put back on; even with the help of two ground 
crewmen he called over, they barely reached the courtyard in time. 
Celeritas was not yet in the courtyard as they landed, but only a short while after their arrival, Laurence 
saw the training master emerge from one of the openings carved into the cliff wall: evidently these were 
private quarters, perhaps for older or more honored dragons. Celeritas shook out his wings and flew over 
to the courtyard, landing neatly on his rear legs, and he looked Temeraire over thoroughly. “Hm, yes, 
excellent depth of chest. Inhale, please. Yes, yes.” He sat back down on all fours. “Now then. Let us 
have a look at you. Two full circuits of the valley, first circuit horizontal turns, then backwing on the 
second. Go at an easy pace, I wish to assess your conformation, not your speed.” He made a nudging 
gesture with his head. 
Temeraire leapt back aloft at full speed. “Gently,” Laurence called, tugging at the reins to remind him, 
and Temeraire slowed reluctantly to a more moderate pace. He soared easily through the turns, and then 
the loops; Celeritas called out, “Now again, at speed,” as they came back around. Laurence bent low to 
Temeraire’s neck as the wings beat with great frantic thrusts about him, and the wind whistled at a high 
pitch past his ears. It was faster than they had ever gone before, and as exhilarating; he could not resist, 
and gave a small whoop for Temeraire’s ears only as they went racing into the turn. 
The second circuit completed, they winged back towards the courtyard again; Temeraire was scarcely 
breathing fast. But before they crossed half the valley there came a sudden tremendous roaring from 
overhead, and a vast black shadow fell over them: Laurence looked up in alarm to see Maximus 
barreling down towards their path as though he meant to ram them. Temeraire jerked to an abrupt stop 
and hovered in place, and Maximus went flying past and swept back up just short of the ground. 
“What the devil do you mean by this, Berkley?” Laurence roared at the top of his lungs, standing in the 
harness; he was in a fury, his hands shaking but for his grip on the reins. “You will explain yourself, sir, 
this instant—” 
“My God! How can he do that?” Berkley was shouting back at him, conversationally, as though they had 
not done anything out of the ordinary at all; Maximus was flying sedately back up towards the 
courtyard. “Celeritas, do you see that?” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (82 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“I do; pray come in and land, Temeraire,” Celeritas said, calling out from the courtyard. “They were 
flying at you on orders, Captain; do not be agitated,” he said to Laurence as Temeraire landed neatly on 
the edge. “It is of utmost importance to test the natural reaction of a dragon to being startled from above, 
where we cannot see; it is an instinct that often cannot be overcome by any training.” 
Laurence was still very ruffled, and Temeraire as well: “That was very unpleasant,” he said to Maximus 
reproachfully. 
“Yes, I know, it was done to me also when we started training,” Maximus said, cheerful and 
unrepentant. “How do you just hang in the air like that?” 
“I never gave it much thought,” Temeraire said, mollified a little; he craned his neck over to examine 
himself. “I suppose I just beat my wings the other way.” 
Laurence stroked Temeraire’s neck comfortingly as Celeritas peered closely at Temeraire’s wing-joints. 
“I had assumed it was a common ability, sir; is it unusual, then?” Laurence asked. 
“Only in the sense of it being entirely unique in my two hundred years’ experience,” Celeritas said 
dryly, sitting back. “Anglewings can maneuver in tight circles, but not hover in such a manner.” He 
scratched his forehead. “We will have to give some thought to the applications of the ability; at the least 
it will make you a very deadly bomber.” 
  
Laurence and Berkley were still discussing it as they went in to dinner, as well as the approach to 
matching Temeraire and Maximus. Celeritas had kept them working all the rest of the day, exploring 
Temeraire’s maneuvering capabilities and pacing the two dragons against each other. Laurence had 
already felt, of course, that Temeraire was extraordinarily fast and handy in the air; but there was a great 
deal of pleasure and satisfaction at hearing Celeritas say so, and to have Temeraire easily outdistance the 
older and larger Maximus. 
Celeritas had even suggested they might try and have Temeraire fly double-pace, if he proved to retain 
his maneuverability even as he grew: that he might be able to fly a strafing run along the length of the 
entire formation and come back to his position in time to fly a second along with the rest of the dragons. 
Berkley and Maximus had taken it in good part to have Temeraire fly rings around them. Of course 
Regal Coppers were the first-rates of the Corps, and Temeraire would certainly never equal Maximus for 
sheer weight and power, so there was no real basis for jealousy; still, after the tension of his first day, 
Laurence was inclined to take an absence of hostility as a victory. Berkley himself was an odd character, 
a little old to be a new captain and very queer in his manners, with a normal state of extreme stolidity 
broken by occasional explosions. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (83 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
But in his strange way he seemed a steady and dedicated officer, and friendly enough. He told Laurence 
abruptly, as they sat at the empty table waiting for the other officers to join them, “You will have to face 
down a damned sight of jealousy, of course, for not having to wait for a prime ’un as much as anything. 
I was six years waiting for Maximus; it was well worth it, but I don’t know that I would be able not to 
hate you if you were prancing about in front of me with an Imperial while he was still in the shell.” 
“Waiting?” Laurence said. “You were assigned to him before he was even hatched?” 
“The moment the egg was cool enough to touch,” Berkley said. “We get four or five Regal Coppers in a 
generation; Aerial Command don’t leave it to chance who mans ’em. I was grounded the moment I said 
yes-thank-you, and here I sat staring at him in the shell and lecturing squeakers, hoping he wouldn’t take 
too much bloody time about it, which by God he did.” Berkley snorted and drained his glass of wine. 
Laurence had already formed a high opinion of Berkley’s skill in the air after their morning’s work, and 
he did indeed seem the sort of man who could be entrusted with a rare and valuable dragon; certainly he 
was very fond of Maximus and showed it in a bluff way. As they had parted from Maximus and 
Temeraire in the courtyard, Laurence had overheard him telling the big dragon, “I suppose I will get no 
peace until you have your harness taken off too, damn you,” while ordering his ground crew to see to it, 
and Maximus nearly knocking him over with a caressing nudge. 
The other officers were beginning to file into the room; most of them were much younger than himself 
or Berkley, and the hall quickly grew noisy with their cheerful and often high-pitched voices. Laurence 
was a little tense at first, but his fears did not materialize; a few more of the lieutenants did look at him 
dubiously, and Granby sat as far away as possible, but other than this no one seemed to pay him much 
notice. 
A tall, blond man with a sharp nose said quietly, “I beg your pardon, sir,” and slipped into the chair 
beside him. Though all the senior officers were in coats and neckcloths for dinner, the newcomer was 
noticeably different in having his neckcloth crisply folded, and his coat pressed. “Captain Jeremy 
Rankin, at your service,” he said courteously, offering a hand. “I believe we have not met?” 
“No, I am just arrived yesterday; Captain Will Laurence, at yours,” Laurence answered. Rankin had a 
firm grip, and a pleasant and easy manner; Laurence found him very easy to talk to, and learned without 
surprise that Rankin was a son of the Earl of Kensington. 
“My family have always sent third sons to the Corps, and in the old days before the Corps were formed 
and dragons reserved to the Crown, my however-many-great-grandfather used to support a pair,” Rankin 
said. “So I have no difficulties going home; we still maintain a small covert for fly-overs, and I was 
often there even during my training. It is an advantage I wish more aviators could have,” he added, low, 
glancing around the table. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (84 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Laurence did not wish to say anything that might be construed as critical; it was all right for Rankin to 
hint at it, being one of them, but from his own lips it could only be offensive. “It must be hard on the 
boys, leaving home so early,” he said, with more tact. “In the Navy we—that is, the Navy does not take 
lads before they are twelve, and even then they are set on shore between cruises, and have time at home. 
Did you find it so, sir?” he added, turning to Berkley. 
“Hm,” Berkley said, swallowing; he looked a little hard at Rankin before answering Laurence. “Can’t 
say that I did; squalled a little, I suppose, but one gets used to it, and we run the squeakers about to keep 
them from getting too homesick.” He turned back to his food with no attempt to keep the conversation 
going, and Laurence was left to turn back and continue his discussion with Rankin. 
“Am I late—oh!” It was a slim young boy, his voice not yet broken but tall for that age, hurrying to the 
table in some disarray; his long red hair was half coming out of his plaited queue. He halted abruptly at 
the table’s edge, then slowly and reluctantly took the seat on Rankin’s other side, which was the only 
one left vacant. Despite his youth, he was a captain: the coat he wore had the double golden bars across 
the shoulders. 
“Why, Catherine, not at all; allow me to pour you some wine,” Rankin said. Laurence, already looking 
in surprise at the boy, thought for a moment he had misheard; then saw he had not, at all: the boy was 
indeed a young lady. Laurence looked around the table blankly; no one else seemed to think anything of 
it, and it was clearly no secret: Rankin was addressing her in polite and formal tones, serving her from 
the platters. 
“Allow me to present you,” Rankin added, turning. “Captain Laurence of Temeraire, Miss—oh, no, I 
forget; that is, Captain Catherine Harcourt of, er, Lily.” 
“Hello,” the girl muttered, not looking up. 
Laurence felt his face going red; she was sitting there in breeches that showed every inch of her leg, with 
a shirt held closed only by a neckcloth; he shifted his gaze to the unalarming top of her head and 
managed to say, “Your servant, Miss Harcourt.” 
This at least caused her to raise her head. “No, it is Captain Harcourt,” she said; her face was pale, and 
her spray of freckles stood out prominently against it, but she was clearly determined to defend her 
rights; she gave Rankin a strangely defiant look as she spoke. 
Laurence had used the address automatically; he had not meant to offend, but evidently he had. “I beg 
your pardon, Captain,” he said at once, bowing his head in apology. It was indeed difficult to address her 
so, however, and the title felt strange and awkward on his tongue; he was afraid he sounded unnaturally 
stiff. “I meant no disrespect.” And now he recognized the dragon’s name as well; it had struck him as 
unusual yesterday, but with so much else to consider, that one detail had slipped his mind. “I believe you 
have the Longwing?” he said politely. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (85 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Yes, that is my Lily,” she said, an involuntary warmth coming into her voice as she spoke her dragon’s 
name. 
“Perhaps you were not aware, Captain Laurence, that Longwings will not take male handlers; it is some 
odd quirk of theirs, for which we must be grateful, else we would be deprived of such charming 
company,” Rankin said, inclining his head to the girl. There was an ironic quality to his voice that made 
Laurence frown; the girl was very obviously not at ease, and Rankin did not seem to be making her more 
so. She had dropped her head again, and was staring at her plate with her lips pale and pressed together 
into an unhappy line. 
“It is very brave of you to undertake such a duty, M—Captain Harcourt; a glass—that is to say, to your 
health,” Laurence said, amending at the last moment and making the toast a sip; he did not think it 
appropriate to force a slip of a girl to drink an entire glass of wine. 
“It is no more than anyone else does,” she said, muttering; then belatedly she took her own glass and 
raised it in return. “I mean: and to yours.” 
Silently he repeated her title and name to himself; it would be very rude of him to make the mistake 
again, having been corrected once, but it was so strange he did not entirely trust himself yet. He took 
care to look at her face and not elsewhere. With her hair pulled back so tightly she did look boyish, 
which was some help, along with the clothes that had allowed him to mistake her initially; he supposed 
that was why she went about in male dress, appalling and illegal though it was. 
He would have liked to talk to her, although it would have been difficult not to ask questions, but he 
could not be steadily talking over Rankin. He was left to wonder at it in the privacy of his own thoughts; 
to think that every Longwing in service was captained by a woman was shocking. Glancing at her slight 
frame, he wondered how she supported the work; he himself felt battered and tired after the day’s flying, 
and though perhaps a proper harness would reduce the strain, he still found it hard to believe a woman 
could manage it day after day. It was cruel to ask it of her, but of course Longwings could not be spared. 
They were perhaps the most deadly English dragons, to be compared only with Regal Coppers, and 
without them the aerial defenses of England would be hideously vulnerable. 
With this object of curiosity to occupy his thoughts, and Rankin’s civil conversation as well, his first 
dinner passed more pleasantly than he had to some extent expected, and he rose from the table 
encouraged, even though Captain Harcourt and Berkley had been silent and uncommunicative 
throughout. As they stood, Rankin turned to him and said, “If you are not otherwise engaged, may I 
invite you to join me in the officers’ club for some chess? I rarely have the chance of a game, and I 
confess that since you mentioned that you play, I have been eager to seize upon the opportunity.” 
“I thank you for the invitation; it would give me great pleasure as well,” Laurence said. “For the moment 
I must beg to be excused, however; I must see to Temeraire, and then I have promised to read to him.”

“Read to him?” Rankin said, with an expression of amusement that did not hide his surprise at the idea. 
“Your dedication is admirable, and all that is natural in a new handler. However, allow me if I may to 
assure you that for the most part dragons are quite capable of managing on their own. I know several of 
our fellow captains are in the habit of spending all their free time with their beasts, and I would not wish 
you based on their example to think it a necessity, or a duty to which you must sacrifice the pleasure of 
human company.” 
“I thank you kindly for your concern, but I assure you it is misplaced in my case,” Laurence said. “For 
my own part, I could desire no better society than Temeraire’s, and it is as much for my own sake as for 
his that we are engaged. But I would be very happy to join you later this evening, unless you keep early 
hours.” 
“I am very happy to hear it, on both counts,” Rankin said. “As for my hours, not at all; I am not in 
training, of course, only here on courier duty, so I need not keep to a student’s schedule. I am ashamed 
to admit that on most days I am not to be found downstairs until shortly before noon, but on the other 
hand that grants me the pleasure of expecting to see you this evening.” 
With this they parted, and Laurence set out to find Temeraire. He was amused to find three of the cadets 
lurking just outside the dining hall door: the sandy-haired boy and two others, each clutching a fistful of 
clean white rags. “Oh, sir,” the boy said, jumping up as he saw Laurence coming out. “Would you need 
any more linens, for Temeraire?” he asked eagerly. “We thought you might, so we brought some, when 
we saw him eating.” 
“Here now, Roland, what d’you think you’re about, there?” Tolly, carrying a load of dishes from the 
dining hall, stopped on seeing the cadets accost Laurence. “You know better’n to pester a captain.” 
“I’m not, am I?” the boy said, looking hopefully at Laurence. “I only thought, perhaps we could help a 
little. He is very big, after all, and Morgan and Dyer and I all have our carabiners; we can lock on 
without any trouble at all,” he said earnestly, displaying an odd harness that Laurence had not even 
noticed before: it was a thick leather belt laced tightly around his waist, with an attached pair of straps 
ending in what looked at first glance like a large chain link made of steel. On closer examination, 
Laurence saw that this had a piece which could be folded in, and thus open the link to be hooked on to 
something else. 
Straightening, Laurence said, “As Temeraire does not yet have a proper harness, I do not think you can 
lock on to the straps with these. However,” he added, hiding a smile at their downcast looks, “come 
along, and we shall see what can be done. Thank you, Tolly,” he said, nodding to the servant. “I can 
manage them.” 
Tolly was not bothering to hide his grin at this exchange. “Right you are,” he said, carrying on with his 
duties.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Roland, is it?” Laurence asked the boy, as he walked on to the courtyard with the three children trotting 
to keep up. 
“Yes, sir, Cadet Emily Roland, at your service.” Turning to her companions, and thus remaining blithely 
unconscious of Laurence’s startled expression, she added, “And these are Andrew Morgan and Peter 
Dyer; we are all in our third year here.” 
“Yes, indeed, we would all like to help,” Morgan said, and Dyer, smaller than the other two and with 
round eyes, only nodded. 
“Very good,” Laurence managed, looking surreptitiously down at the girl. Her hair was cut bowl-
fashion, just like the two boys’, and she had a sturdy, stocky build; her voice was scarcely pitched higher 
than theirs: his mistake had not been unnatural. Now that he gave a moment’s thought to the matter, it 
made perfect sense; the Corps would naturally train up a few girls, in anticipation of needing them as 
Longwings hatched, and likely Captain Harcourt was herself the product of such training. But he could 
not help wondering what sort of parent would hand over a girl of tender years to the rigor of the service. 
They came out into the courtyard and were met by a scene of raucous activity: a great confusion of 
wings and dragon voices filling the air. Most if not all of the dragons had just come from feeding and 
were now being attended by members of their crews, who were busy cleaning the harnesses. Despite 
Rankin’s words, Laurence scarcely saw a dragon whose captain was not standing by its head and petting 
or talking to it; this evidently was a common interlude during the day when dragons and their handlers 
were at liberty. 
He did not immediately see Temeraire; after searching the busy courtyard for a few moments, he 
realized that Temeraire had settled outside the exterior walls, likely to avoid the bustle and noise. Before 
going out to him, Laurence took the cadets over to Levitas: the little dragon was curled up alone just 
inside the courtyard walls, watching the other dragons with their officers. Levitas was still in his harness, 
but it looked much better than it had on the previous day: the leather looked as though it had been 
worked over and rubbed with oil to make it more supple, and the metal rings joining the straps were 
brightly polished. 
Laurence now guessed that the rings were intended to provide a place for the carabiners to latch on; 
though Levitas was small compared with Temeraire, he was still a large creature, and Laurence thought 
he could easily sustain the weight of the three cadets for the short journey. The dragon was eager and 
happy for the attention, his eyes brightening as Laurence made the suggestion. 
“Oh yes, I can carry you all easily,” he said, looking at the three cadets, who looked back at him with no 
less eagerness. They all scrambled up as nimbly as squirrels, and each of them locked on to two separate 
rings in an obviously well-practiced motion. 
Laurence tugged on each strap; they seemed secure enough. “Very well, Levitas; take them down to the

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
shore, and Temeraire and I will meet you there shortly,” he said, patting the dragon’s side. 
Having seen them off, Laurence wove through the other dragons and made his way out of the gate. He 
stopped short on his first clear look at Temeraire; the dragon looked strangely downcast, a marked 
difference from his happy attitude at the conclusion of the morning’s work, and Laurence hurried to his 
side. “Are you not feeling well?” Laurence asked, inspecting his jaws, but Temeraire was bloodstained 
and messy from his meal, and looked to have eaten well. “Did something you ate disagree with you?” 
“No, I am perfectly well,” Temeraire said. “It is only— Laurence, I am a proper dragon, am I not?” 
Laurence stared; the note of uncertainty in Temeraire’s voice was wholly new. “As proper a dragon as 
there is in the world; what on earth would make you ask such a question? Has anyone said anything 
unkind to you?” A quick surge of temper was rising in him already at the mere possibility; the aviators 
might look at him askance and say what they liked, but he was not going to tolerate anyone making 
remarks to Temeraire. 
“Oh, no,” Temeraire said, but in a way that made Laurence doubt the words. “No one was unkind, but 
they could not help noticing, while we were all feeding, that I do not look quite like the rest of them. 
They are all much more brightly colored than I am, and their wings do not have so many joins. Also, 
they have those ridges along their backs, and mine is plain, and I have more talons on my feet.” He 
turned and inspected himself as he catalogued these differences. “So they looked at me a little oddly, but 
no one was unkind. I suppose it is because I am a Chinese dragon?” 
“Yes, indeed, and you must recall that the Chinese are counted the most skilled breeders in the world,” 
Laurence said firmly. “If anything, the others should look to you as their ideal, not the reverse, and I beg 
you will not for a moment doubt yourself. Only consider how well Celeritas spoke of your flying this 
morning.” 
“But I cannot breathe fire, or spit acid,” Temeraire said, settling back down, still with an air of dejection. 
“And I am not as big as Maximus.” He was quiet for a moment, then added, “He and Lily ate first; the 
rest of us had to wait until after they were done, and then we were allowed to hunt as a group.” 
Laurence frowned; it had not occurred to him that dragons would have a system of rank among 
themselves. “My dear, there has never been a dragon of your breed in England, so your precedence has 
not yet been established,” he said, trying to find an explanation which would console Temeraire. “Also, 
perhaps it has something to do with the rank of their captains, for you must recall that I have less 
seniority than any other captain here.” 
“That would be very silly; you are older than most of them are, and have a great deal of experience,” 
Temeraire said, losing some of his unhappiness in indignation over the idea of a slight to Laurence. 
“You have won battles, and most of them are only still in training.” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (89 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Yes, though at sea, and things are very different aloft,” Laurence said. “But it is quite true that 
precedence and rank are not guarantors of wisdom or good breeding; pray do not take it so to heart. I am 
sure that when we have been in service a year or two, you will be acknowledged as you deserve. But for 
the moment, did you get enough to eat? We shall return to the feeding grounds at once if not.” 
“Oh, no, there was no shortage,” Temeraire said. “I was able to catch whatever I wanted, and the others 
did not get in my way very much at all.” 
He fell silent, and was clearly still inclined to be dismal; Laurence said, “Come, we must see about 
getting you bathed.” 
Temeraire brightened at the prospect, and after the better part of an hour spent playing with Levitas in 
the lake and then being scrubbed by the cadets, his spirits were greatly restored. Afterwards, he curled 
happily about Laurence in the warm courtyard when they settled down together to read, apparently much 
happier. But Laurence still saw Temeraire looking at his gold-and-pearl chain more often, and touching 
it with the tip of his tongue; he was beginning to recognize the gesture as a desire for reassurance. He 
tried to put affection in his voice as he read, and stroked the foreleg on which he was comfortably 
seated. 
He was still frowning with concern later that evening, as he came into the officers’ club; a left-handed 
blessing, for the momentary hush that fell when he came into the room bothered him far less than it 
might otherwise have done. Granby was standing at the pianoforte near the door, and he pointedly 
touched his forehead in salute and said, “Sir,” as Laurence came in. 
It was an odd sort of insolence that could hardly be reprimanded; Laurence chose to answer as if it had 
been sincere, and said politely, “Mr. Granby,” with a nod that he made a general gesture to the room, 
and walked on with what haste was reasonable. Rankin was sitting far back in a corner of the room by a 
small table, reading a newspaper; Laurence joined him, and in a few moments the two of them had set 
up the chessboard which Rankin had taken down from a shelf. 
The buzz of conversation had already resumed; between moves, Laurence observed the room as well as 
he could without making himself obvious. Now that his eyes were opened, he could see a few female 
officers scattered in the crowd here, also. Their presence seemed to place no restraint on the general 
company; the conversation though good-natured was not wholly refined, and it was made noisy and 
confused by interruptions. 
Nevertheless there was a clear sense of good-fellowship throughout the room, and he could not help 
feeling a little wistful at his natural exclusion from it; both by their preference and his own he did not 
feel that he was fitted for participation, and it could not but give him a pang of loneliness. But he 
dismissed it almost at once; a Navy captain had to be used to a solitary existence, and often without such 
companionship as he had in Temeraire. And also, he might now look forward to Rankin’s company as 
well; he returned his attention to the chessboard, and looked no more at the others.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Rankin was perhaps out of practice a little, but not unskilled, and as the game was not one of Laurence’s 
favorite pastimes they were reasonably well-matched. While they played, Laurence mentioned his 
concern for Temeraire to Rankin, who listened with sympathy. “It is indeed shameful that they should 
have not given him precedence, but I must counsel you to leave the remedy to him,” Rankin said. “They 
behave that way in the wild; the deadlier breeds demand first fruits of the hunt, and the weaker give way. 
He must likely assert himself among the other beasts to be given more respect.” 
“Do you mean by offering some sort of challenge? But surely that cannot be a wise policy,” Laurence 
said, alarmed at the very idea; he had heard the old fantastic stories of wild dragons fighting among 
themselves, and killing one another in such dueling. “To allow battle among such desperately valuable 
creatures, for so little purpose?” 
“It rarely comes to an actual battle; they know one another’s capabilities, and I promise you, once he 
feels certain of his strength, he will not tolerate it, nor will he meet with any great resistance,” Rankin 
said. 
Laurence could not have great confidence in this; he was certain it was no lack of courage that prevented 
Temeraire from taking precedence, but a more delicate sensibility, which had unhappily enabled him to 
sense the lack of approbation of the other dragons. “I would still like to find some means of reassuring 
him,” Laurence said sadly; he could see that henceforth all the feedings would be a source of fresh 
unhappiness to Temeraire, and yet they could not be avoided, save by feeding him at different times, 
which would only make him feel still more isolated from the others. 
“Oh, give him a trinket and he will settle down,” Rankin said. “It is amazing how it restores their spirits; 
whenever my beast becomes sulky, I bring him a bauble and he is at once all happiness again; just like a 
temperamental mistress.” 
Laurence could not help smiling at the absurdity of this joking comparison. “I have been meaning to get 
him a collar, as it happens,” he said, more seriously, “such as the one Celeritas wears, and I do believe it 
would make him very happy. But I do not suppose there is anywhere here where such an item may be 
commissioned.” 
“I can offer you a remedy for that, at any rate. I go to Edinburgh regularly on my courier duties, and 
there are several excellent jewelers there; some of them even carry ready-made items for dragons, as 
there are many coverts here in the north within flying distance. If you care to accompany me, I would be 
happy to bear you there,” Rankin said. “My next flight will be this Saturday, and I can easily have you 
back by suppertime if we leave in the morning.” 
“Thank you; I am very much obliged to you,” Laurence said, surprised and pleased. “I will apply to 
Celeritas for permission to go.” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (91 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Celeritas frowned at the request, made the next morning, and looked at Laurence narrowly. “You wish to 
go with Captain Rankin? Well, it will be the last day of liberty you have for a long time, for you must 
and will be here for every moment of Temeraire’s flight training.” 
He was almost fierce about it, and Laurence was surprised by his vehemence. “I assure you I have no 
objection,” he said, wondering in astonishment if the training master thought he meant to shirk his 
duties. “Indeed, I had not imagined otherwise, and I am well aware of the need for urgency in his 
training. If my absence would cause any difficulty, I beg you to have no hesitation in refusing the 
request.” 
Whatever the source of his initial disapproval, Celeritas was mollified by this statement. “As it happens, 
the ground crewmen will need a day to fit Temeraire out with his new gear, and it will be ready by 
then,” he said, in less stern tones. “I suppose we can spare you, as long as Temeraire is not finicky about 
being harnessed without you there, and you may as well have a final excursion.” 
Temeraire assured Laurence he did not mind, so the plan was settled, and Laurence spent part of the next 
few evenings making measurements of his neck, and of Maximus’s, thinking the Regal Copper’s current 
size might be a good approximation for what Temeraire could reach in future. He pretended to 
Temeraire that these were for the harness; he looked forward to giving the present as a surprise, and 
seeing it take away some of the quiet distress that lingered, casting a pall over the dragon’s usually high 
spirits. 
Rankin looked with amusement at his sketches of possible designs. The two of them had already formed 
the settled habit of playing chess together in the evenings, and sitting together at dinner. Laurence so far 
had little conversation with the other aviators; he regretted it, but could see little point in trying to push 
himself forward when he was comfortable enough as he was, and in the absence of any sort of invitation. 
It seemed clear to him that Rankin was as outside the common life of the aviators as he was, perhaps set 
aside by the elegance of his manners, and if they were both outcast for the same reason, they might at 
least have the pleasure of each other’s society for compensation. 
He and Berkley met at breakfast and training every day, and he continued to find the other captain an 
astute airman and aerial tactician; but at dinner or in company Berkley was silent. Laurence was not sure 
either that he wished to draw the man into intimacy, or that a gesture in that direction would be 
welcome, so he contented himself with being civil, and discussing technical matters; so far they had 
known each other only a few days, and there would be time enough to take a better measure of the man’s 
real character. 
He had steeled himself to react properly on meeting Captain Harcourt again, but she seemed shy of his 
company; he saw her almost only at a distance, though Temeraire was soon to be flying in company with 
her dragon, Lily. One morning however she was at table when he arrived for breakfast, and in an attempt 
to make natural conversation, he asked how her dragon came to be called Lily, thinking it might be a 
nickname like Volly’s. She flushed to her roots again and said very stiffly, “I liked the name; pray how 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (92 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
did you come to name Temeraire?” 
“To be perfectly honest, I did not have any idea of the proper way of naming a dragon, nor any way of 
finding out at the time,” Laurence said, feeling he had made a misstep; no one had remarked on 
Temeraire’s unusual name before, and only now that she had brought him to task for it did he guess that 
perhaps he had raised a sore point with her. “I called him after a ship: the first Téméraire was captured 
from the French, and the one presently in service is a ninety-eight-gun three-decker, one of our finest 
line-of-battle ships.” 
When he had made this confession, she seemed to grow more easy, and said with more candor, “Oh; as 
you have said as much, I do not mind admitting that it was nearly the same with me. Lily was not 
properly expected to hatch for another five years at the earliest, and I had no notion of a name. When her 
egg hardened, they woke me in the middle of the night at Edinburgh covert and flung me on a 
Winchester, and I barely managed to reach the baths before she broke the shell. I simply gaped when she 
invited me to give her a name, and I could not think of anything else.” 
“It is a charming name, and perfectly suits her, Catherine,” Rankin said, joining them at the table. “Good 
morning, Laurence; have you seen the paper? Lord Pugh has finally managed to marry off his daughter; 
Ferrold must be desperately hard up.” This piece of gossip, concerning as it did people whom Harcourt 
did not know at all, left her outside the conversation. Before Laurence could change the subject, 
however, she excused herself and slipped away from the table, and he lost the opportunity to further the 
acquaintance. 
The few days remaining in the week before the excursion passed swiftly. The training as yet was still 
more a matter of testing Temeraire’s flying abilities, and seeing how best he and Maximus could be 
worked into the formation centered on Lily. Celeritas had them fly endless circuits around the training 
valley, sometimes trying to minimize the number of wingbeats, sometimes trying to maximize their 
speed, and always trying to keep them in line with one another. One memorable morning was spent 
almost entirely upside down, and Laurence found himself dizzy and red-faced at the end of it. The 
stouter Berkley was huffing as he staggered off Maximus’s back after the final pass, and Laurence leapt 
forward to ease him down to the ground as his legs gave out from under him. 
Maximus hovered anxiously over Berkley and rumbled in distress. “Stop that moaning, Maximus; 
nothing more ridiculous than a creature of your size behaving like a mother hen,” Berkley said as he fell 
into the chair that the servants had hurriedly brought. “Ah, thank you,” he said, taking the glass of 
brandy Laurence offered him, and sipped at it while Laurence loosened his neckcloth. 
“I am sorry to have put you under such a strain,” Celeritas said, when Berkley was no longer gasping 
and scarlet. “Ordinarily these trials would be spread over half a month’s time. Perhaps I am pressing on 
too quickly.” 
“Nonsense, I will be well in a trice,” Berkley said at once. “I know damned well we cannot spare a

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
moment, Celeritas, so do not be holding us back on my account.” 
“Laurence, why are matters so urgent?” Temeraire asked that evening after dinner, as they once again 
settled down together outside the courtyard walls to read. “Is there to be a great battle soon, and we are 
needed for it?” 
Laurence folded the book closed, keeping his place with a finger. “No; I am sorry to disappoint you, but 
we are too raw to be sent by choice directly into a major action. Still, it is very likely that Lord Nelson 
will not be able to destroy the French fleet without the help of one of the Longwing formations presently 
stationed in England; our duty will be to take their place, so they may go. That will indeed be a great 
battle, and though we will not participate in it directly, I assure you our part is by no means 
unimportant.” 
“No, though it does not sound very exciting,” Temeraire said. “But perhaps France will invade us, and 
then we will have to fight?” He sounded rather more hopeful than anything else. 
“We must hope not,” Laurence said. “If Nelson destroys their fleet, it will pretty well put paid to any 
chance of Bonaparte’s bringing his army across. Though I have heard he has something like a thousand 
boats to carry his men, they are only transports, and the Navy would sink them by the dozens if they 
tried to come across without the protection of the fleet.” 
Temeraire sighed and put his head down over his forelegs. “Oh,” he said. 
Laurence laughed and stroked his nose. “How bloodthirsty you are,” he said with amusement. “Do not 
fear; I promise you we will see enough action when your training is done. There is a great deal of 
skirmishing over the Channel, for one thing; and then we may be sent in support of a naval operation, or 
perhaps sent to harass the French shipping independently.” This heartened Temeraire greatly, and he 
turned his attention to the book with restored good humor. 
Friday they spent in an endurance trial, trying to see how long both dragons could stay aloft. The 
formation’s slowest members would be the two Yellow Reapers, so both Temeraire and Maximus had to 
be kept to that slower pace for the test, and they went around and around the training valley in an endless 
circle, while above them the rest of the formation performed a drill under Celeritas’s supervision. 
A steady rain blurred all the landscape below into a grey monotony and made the task still more boring. 
Temeraire often turned his head to inquire, a little plaintively, how long he had been flying, and 
Laurence was generally obliged to inform him that scarcely a quarter of an hour had passed since the last 
query. Laurence at least could watch the formation wheeling and diving, their bright colors marked 
against the pale grey sky; poor Temeraire had to keep his head straight and level to maintain the best 
flying posture. 
After perhaps three hours, Maximus began to fall off the pace, his great wings beating more slowly and

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
his head drooping; Berkley took him back in, and Temeraire was left all alone, still going around. The 
rest of the formation came spiraling down to land in the courtyard, and Laurence saw the dragons 
nodding to Maximus, inclining their heads respectfully. At this distance he could not make out any 
words, but it was clear they were all conversing easily among themselves while their captains milled 
about and Celeritas gathered them together to review their performance. Temeraire saw them as well, 
and sighed a little, though he said nothing; Laurence leaned forward and stroked his neck, and silently 
vowed to bring him back the most elegant jewels he could find in the whole of Edinburgh, if he had to 
draw out half his capital to do so. 
  
Laurence came out into the courtyard early the next morning to say farewell to Temeraire before his trip 
with Rankin. He stopped short as he emerged from the hall: Levitas was being put under gear by a small 
ground crew, with Rankin at his head reading a newspaper and paying little attention to the proceedings. 
“Hello, Laurence,” the little dragon said to him happily. “Look, this is my captain, he has come! And we 
are flying to Edinburgh today.” 
“Have you been talking with him?” Rankin said to Laurence, glancing up. “I see you were not 
exaggerating, and that you do indeed enjoy dragon society; I hope you will not find yourself tiring of it. 
You will be taking Laurence along with myself today; you must make an effort to show him a good 
pace,” he told Levitas. 
“Oh, I will, I promise,” Levitas said at once, bobbing his head anxiously. 
Laurence made some civil answer and walked quickly to Temeraire’s side to cover his confusion; he did 
not know what to do. There was no possible way to avoid the journey now without being truly insulting; 
but he felt almost ill. Over the last few days he had seen more evidence than he liked of Levitas’s 
unhappiness and neglect: the little dragon watched anxiously for a handler who did not come, and if he 
or his harness had been given more than a cursory wipe, it was because Laurence had encouraged the 
cadets to see to him, and asked Hollin to continue attending to his harness. To find Rankin the one 
responsible for such neglect was bitterly disappointing; to see Levitas behaving with such servility and 
gratitude for the least cold attention was painful. 
Perceived through the lens of his neglect of his dragon, Rankin’s remarks on dragons took on a character 
of disdain that could only be strange and unpleasant in an aviator; and his isolation from his fellow 
officers also, rather than an indication of nice taste. Every other aviator had introduced himself with his 
dragon’s name ready to his lips; Rankin alone had considered his family name of more importance, and 
left Laurence to find out only by accident that Levitas was assigned to him. But Laurence had not seen 
through any of this, and now he found he had, in the most unguarded sort of way, encouraged the 
acquaintance of a man he could never respect.

He petted Temeraire and made him some reassurances meant mostly for his own comfort. “Is anything 
wrong, Laurence?” Temeraire said, nosing at him gently with concern. “You do not seem well.” 
“No, I am perfectly well, I assure you,” he said, making an effort to sound normal. “You are quite 
certain you do not mind my going?” he asked, with a faint hope. 
“Not at all, and you will be back by evening, will you not?” Temeraire asked. “Now that we have 
finished Duncan, I was hoping perhaps you could read me something more about mathematics; I thought 
it was very interesting how you explained that you could tell where you are, when you have been sailing 
for a long time, only through knowing the time and some equations.” 
Laurence had been very glad to leave behind mathematics after having forced the basics of trigonometry 
into his head. “Certainly, if you like,” he said, trying to keep dismay out of his voice. “But I thought 
perhaps you would enjoy something about Chinese dragons?” 
“Oh, yes, that would be splendid too; we could read that next,” Temeraire said. “It is very nice how 
many books there are, indeed; and on so many subjects.” 
If it would give Temeraire something to think about and keep him from becoming distressed, Laurence 
was prepared to go as far as to bring his Latin up to snuff and read him Principia Mathematica in the 
original; so he only sighed privately. “Very well, then I leave you in the hands of the ground crew; I see 
them coming now.” 
Hollin was leading the party; the young crewman had attended so well to Temeraire’s harness and seen 
to Levitas with such goodwill that Laurence had spoken of him to Celeritas, and asked to have him 
assigned to lead Temeraire’s ground crew. Laurence was pleased to see the request had been granted; 
because this step was evidently a promotion of some significance, there had been some uncertainty 
about the matter. He nodded to the young man. “Mr. Hollin, will you be so good as to present me to 
these other men?” he asked. 
When he had been given all their names and repeated them silently over to fix them in his memory, he 
deliberately met their eyes in turn and said firmly, “I am sure Temeraire will give you no difficulty, but I 
trust you will make a point of consulting his comfort as you make the adjustments. Temeraire, please 
have no hesitation about informing these men if you notice the least discomfort or restriction upon your 
movement.” 
Levitas’s case had provided him with evidence that some crewmen might neglect their assigned 
dragon’s gear if a captain was not watchful, and indeed anything else was hardly to be expected. Though 
he had no fear of Hollin’s neglecting his work, Laurence meant to put the other men on notice that he 
would not tolerate any such neglect where Temeraire was concerned; if such severity fixed his 
reputation as a hard captain, so be it. Perhaps in comparison with other aviators he was; he would not 
neglect what he considered his duty for the sake of being liked.

A murmur of “Very good” and “Right you are” came in response; he was able to ignore the raised 
eyebrows and exchanged glances. “Carry on, then,” he said with a final nod, and turned away with no 
small reluctance to join Rankin. 
All his pleasure in the expedition was gone; it was distasteful in the extreme to stand by while Rankin 
snapped at Levitas and ordered him to hunch down uncomfortably for them to board. Laurence climbed 
up as quickly as he could, and did his best to sit where his weight would give Levitas the least difficulty. 
The flight was brief, at least; Levitas was very swift, and the ground rolled away at a tremendous pace. 
He was glad to find the speed of their passage made conversation nearly impossible, and he was able to 
give brief answers to the few remarks Rankin ventured to shout. They landed less than two hours after 
they had left, at the great walled covert which spread out beneath the watchful looming eye of 
Edinburgh Castle. 
“Stay here quietly; I do not want to hear that you have been pestering the crew when I return,” Rankin 
said sharply to Levitas, after dismounting; he threw the reins of his harness around a post, as if Levitas 
were a horse to be tethered. “You can eat when we return to Loch Laggan.” 
“I do not want to bother them, and I can wait to eat, but I am a little thirsty,” Levitas said in a small 
voice. “I tried to fly as fast as I could,” he added. 
“It was very fast indeed, Levitas, and I am grateful to you. Of course you must have something to 
drink,” Laurence said; this was as much as he could bear. “You there,” he called to the ground crewmen 
lounging around the edges of the clearing; none of them had stirred when Levitas had landed. “Bring a 
trough of clean water at once, and see to his harness while you are about it.” 
The men looked a little surprised, but they set to work under Laurence’s hard eye. Rankin did not make 
any objection, although as they climbed up the stairs away from the covert and onto the streets of the 
city he said, “I see you are a little tender-hearted towards them. I am hardly surprised, as that is the 
common mode among aviators, but I must tell you that I find discipline answers far better than the sort 
of coddling more often seen. Levitas for instance must always be ready for a long and dangerous flight; 
it is good for him to be used to going without.” 
Laurence felt all the awkwardness of his situation; he was here as Rankin’s guest, and he would have to 
fly back with the man in the evening. Nevertheless, he could not restrain himself from saying, “I will not 
deny having the warmest sentiments towards dragons as a whole; in my experience thus far I have found 
them uniformly appealing and worthy of nothing but respect. However, I must disagree with you very 
strongly that providing ordinary and reasonable care in any way constitutes coddling, and I have always 
found that deprivation and hardship, when necessary, can be better endured by men who have not been 
subjected to them previously for no cause.”

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Oh, dragons are not men, you know; but I will not argue with you,” Rankin said easily. Perversely it 
made Laurence even angrier; if Rankin had been willing to defend his philosophy, it could have been a 
sincere if wrongheaded position. But clearly it was not; Rankin was only consulting his own ease, and 
these remarks were merely excuses for the neglect he performed. 
Fortunately they were at the crossroads where their paths were to diverge. Laurence did not have to 
endure Rankin’s company any longer, as the man had to go on rounds to the military offices in the city; 
they had agreed to meet back at the covert before their departure, and he escaped gladly. 
He wandered around the city for the next hour without direction or purpose, solely to clear his mind and 
temper. There was no obvious way to ameliorate Levitas’s situation, and Rankin was clearly inured to 
disapproval: Laurence now recalled Berkley’s silence, Harcourt’s evident discomfort, the avoidance of 
the other aviators in general, and Celeritas’s disapproval. It was unpleasant to think that by showing 
such an evident partiality for Rankin’s company, he had given himself the character of approving the 
man’s behavior. 
Here was something for which he had rightly earned the cold looks of the other officers. It was of no use 
to say he had not known: he ought to have known. Instead of putting himself to the trouble of learning 
the ways of his new comrades-in-arms, he had been happy enough to throw himself into the company of 
one they avoided and looked at askance. He could hardly excuse himself by saying he had not consulted 
or trusted their general judgment. 
He calmed himself only with difficulty. He could not easily undo the damage he had done in a few 
unthinking days, but he could and would alter his behavior henceforth. By putting forth the dedication 
and effort that was only Temeraire’s due in any case, he could prove that he neither approved nor 
intended to practice any sort of neglect. By courtesy and attention to those aviators with whom he would 
be training, like Berkley and the other captains of the formation, he could show that he did not hold 
himself above his company. These small measures would take a great deal of time to repair his 
reputation, but they were all he could do. The best he could do was resolve upon them at once, and 
prepare to endure however long it would take. 
Having finally drawn himself from his self-recrimination, he now took his bearings and hurried on to the 
offices of the Royal Bank. His usual bankers were Drummonds, in London, but on learning that he was 
to be stationed at Loch Laggan, he had written to his prize-agent to direct the funds from the capture of 
the Amitié here. As soon as he had given his name, he at once saw that the instructions had been 
received and obeyed; for he was instantly conducted to a private office and greeted with particular 
warmth. 
The banker, a Mr. Donnellson, was happy to inform him, on his inquiry, that the prize-money for the 
Amitié had included a bounty for Temeraire equal to the value that would have been placed on an 
unhatched egg of the same breed. “Not that a number could easily be settled upon, as I understand it, for 
we have no notion of what the French paid for it, but at length it was held equal to a Regal Copper egg 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (98 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
in value, and I am happy to say that your two-eighths share of the entire prize comes to nearly fourteen 
thousand pounds,” he finished, and struck Laurence dumb. 
Having recovered over a glass of excellent brandy, Laurence soon perceived the self-serving efforts of 
Admiral Croft behind this extraordinary assessment. But he hardly objected; after a brief discussion 
which ended in his authorizing the Bank to invest perhaps half of the money into the Funds for him, he 
shook Mr. Donnellson’s hand with enthusiasm and took away a handful of banknotes and gold, along 
with a generously offered letter which he might show to merchants to establish his credit. The news 
restored his spirits to some extent, and he soothed them further by purchasing a great many books and 
examining several different pieces of valuable jewelry, and imagining Temeraire’s happiness at 
receiving them both. 
He settled finally upon a broad pendant of platinum almost like a breastplate, set with sapphires around a 
single enormous pearl; the piece was designed to fasten about the dragon’s neck with a chain that could 
be extended as Temeraire grew. The price was enough to make him swallow, but he recklessly signed 
the cheque regardless, and then waited while a boy ran to certify the amount with the Bank so he could 
immediately bear away the well-wrapped piece, with some difficulty due to its weight. 
From there he went straight back to the covert, even though there was another hour to the appointed 
meeting time. Levitas was lying unattended in the same dusty landing ground, his tail curled around 
himself; he looked tired and lonely. There was a small herd of sheep kept penned in the covert; Laurence 
ordered one killed and brought for him, then sat with the dragon and talked to him quietly until Rankin 
returned. 
The flight back was a little slower than the one out, and Rankin spoke coldly to Levitas when they 
landed. Past the point of caring if it seemed rude, Laurence interrupted with praise and patted Levitas. It 
was little enough, and he felt miserable to see the little dragon huddled silently in a corner of the 
courtyard after Rankin had gone inside. But Aerial Command had given Levitas to Rankin; Laurence 
had no authority to correct the man, who was senior to him. 
Temeraire’s new harness was neatly assembled upon a couple of benches by the side of the courtyard, 
the broad neck-brace marked with his name in silver rivets. Temeraire himself was sitting outside again, 
looking over the quiet lake valley that was gradually fading into shadow as the late-afternoon sun sank 
in the west, his eyes thoughtful and a little sad. Laurence went to his side at once, carrying the heavy 
packages. 
Temeraire’s joy in the pendant was so great as to rescue Laurence’s mood as well as his own. The silver 
metal looked dazzling against his black hide, and once it was on he tilted the piece up with a forehand to 
look at the great pearl in enormous satisfaction, his pupils widening tremendously so he could better 
examine it. “And I do so like pearls, Laurence,” he said, nuzzling at him gratefully. “It is very beautiful; 
but was it not dreadfully expensive?”

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“It is worth every penny to see you looking so handsome,” Laurence said, meaning that it was worth 
every penny to see him so happy. “The prize-money for the Amitié has come in, so I am well in pocket, 
my dear. Indeed, it is quite your due, you know, for the better part of it comes from the bounty for our 
having taken your egg from the French.” 
“Well, that was none of my doing, although I am very glad it happened,” Temeraire said. “I am sure I 
could not have liked any French captain half so much as you. Oh, Laurence, I am so very happy, and 
none of the others have anything nearly so nice.” He cuddled himself around Laurence with a deep sigh 
of satisfaction. 
Laurence climbed into the crook of one foreleg and sat there petting him and enjoying his continued 
quiet gloating over the pendant. Of course, if the French ship had not been so delayed and then captured, 
some French aviator would have had Temeraire by now; Laurence had previously given little thought to 
what might have been. Likely the man was somewhere cursing his luck; the French certainly would have 
learned that the egg had been captured by now, even if they did not know that it had hatched an 
Imperial, or that Temeraire had been successfully harnessed. 
He looked up at his preening dragon and felt the rest of his sorrow and anxiety leave him; whatever else 
happened, he could hardly complain of the turn fate had served him, in comparison with that poor 
fellow. “I have brought you some books as well,” he said. “Shall I begin on Newton for you? I have 
found a translation of his book on the principles of mathematics, although I will warn you at once that I 
am wholly unlikely to be able to make sense of what I read for you; I am no great hand at mathematics 
beyond what my tutors got into my head for sailing.” 
“Please do,” Temeraire said, looking away from his new treasure for a moment. “I am sure we will be 
able to puzzle it out together, whatever it is.” 
  
Chapter 7 
 
LAURENCE ROSE EARLY the next morning and breakfasted alone, to have a little time before the 
training would begin. He had examined the new harness carefully last night, looking over each neat 
stitch and testing all the solid rings; Temeraire had also assured him that the new gear was very 
comfortable, and that the crewmen had been attentive to his wishes. He felt some gesture was due, and 
so having made some calculations in his head, he now walked out to the workshops. 
Hollin was already up and working in his stall, and he stepped out at once on catching sight of Laurence. 
“Morning to you, sir; I hope there is nothing wrong with the harness?” the young man asked. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (100 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“No; on the contrary, I commend you and your colleagues highly,” Laurence said. “It looks splendid, 
and Temeraire tells me he is very happy in it; thank you. Kindly tell the others for me that I will be 
having an additional half-crown for each man disbursed with their pay.” 
“Why, that is very kind of you, sir,” Hollin said, looking pleased but not terribly surprised; Laurence 
was very glad to see his reaction. An extra ration of rum or grog was of course not a desirable reward to 
men who could buy liquor easily from the village below, and soldiers and aviators were paid better than 
sailors, so he had puzzled over an appropriate amount: he wanted to reward their diligence, but he did 
not want to seem as though he were trying to purchase the men’s loyalty. 
“I also wish to commend you personally,” Laurence added, more relaxed now. “Levitas’s harness looks 
in much better order, and he seems more comfortable. I am obliged to you: I know it was not your duty.” 
“Oh! Nothing to it,” Hollin said, smiling broadly now. “The little fellow was made so happy, I was right 
glad to have done it. I’ll give him a look over now and again to make sure he’s staying in good order. 
Seems to me he’s a little lonely,” he added. 
Laurence would never go so far as to criticize another officer to a crewman; he contented himself with 
saying merely, “I think he was certainly grateful for the attention, and if you should have the time, I 
would be glad of it.” 
It was the last moment that he had time to spare concern for Levitas, or anything beyond the tasks 
immediately before him. Celeritas had satisfied himself that he understood Temeraire’s flying 
capabilities, and now that Temeraire had his fine new harness, their training began in earnest. From the 
beginning, Laurence was staggering straight to bed after supper, and having to be woken by the servants 
at the first light of morning; he could barely muster any sort of conversation at the dinner table, and he 
spent every free moment either dozing with Temeraire in the sun or soaking in the heat of the baths. 
Celeritas was merciless and tireless both. There were countless repetitions of this wheeling turn, or that 
pattern of swoops and dives; then flying short bombing runs at top speed, during which the bellmen 
hurled practice bombs down at targets on the valley floor. Long hours of gunnery-practice, until 
Temeraire could hear a full volley of eight rifles go off behind his ears without so much as blinking; 
crew maneuvers and drills until he no longer twitched when he was clambered upon or his harness 
shifted; and to close every day’s work, another long stretch of endurance training, sending him around 
and around until he had nearly doubled the amount of time he could spend aloft at his quickest pace. 
Even while Temeraire was sprawled panting in the training courtyard and getting his wind back, the 
training master had Laurence practice moving about the harness both on Temeraire’s back and upon 
rings hung over the cliff wall, to increase his skill at a task that other aviators had been doing from their 
earliest years in the service. It was not too unlike moving about the tops in a gale, if one imagined a ship 
moving at a pace of thirty miles in an hour and turning completely sideways or upside down at any 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (101 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
moment; his hands slipped free constantly during the first week, and without the paired carabiners he 
would have plummeted to his death a dozen times over. 
And as soon as they were released from the day’s flight training, they were handed straight over to an 
old captain, Joulson, for drilling in aerial signaling. The flag and flare signals for communicating general 
instructions were much the same as in the Navy, and the most basic gave Laurence no difficulty; but the 
need to coordinate quickly between dragons in mid-air made the usual technique of spelling out more 
unusual messages impractical. As a result, there was a vastly longer list of signals, some requiring as 
many as six flags, and all of these had to be beaten into their heads, for a captain could not rely solely 
upon his signal-officer. A signal seen and acted upon even a moment more quickly might make all the 
difference in the world, so both captain and dragon must know them all; the signal-officer was merely a 
safeguard, and his duty more to send signals for Laurence and call his attention to new signals in battle 
than to be the sole source of translation. 
To Laurence’s embarrassment, Temeraire proved quicker to learn the signals than himself; even Joulson 
was more than a little taken aback at the dragon’s proficiency. “And he is old to be learning them, 
besides,” he told Laurence. “Usually we start them on the flags the very day after hatching. I did not like 
to say so before, not to be discouraging, but I expected him to have a good deal of trouble. If a dragonet 
is a bit slow and does not learn all the signals by the end of their fifth or sixth week, he struggles with 
the last ones sadly; but here Temeraire is already older than that, and learning them as though he were 
fresh from the egg.” 
But though Temeraire had no exceptional difficulty, the effort of memorization and repetition was still 
as tiring as their more physical duties. Five weeks of rigorous work passed this way, without even a 
break on Sundays; they progressed together with Maximus and Berkley through the increasingly 
complex maneuvers that had to be learned before they could join the formation, and all the time the 
dragons were growing enormously. By the end of this period, Maximus had almost reached his full adult 
size, and Temeraire was scarcely one man’s height less in the shoulder, though much leaner, and his 
growth was now mostly in bulk and in his wings rather than his height. 
He was beautifully proportionate throughout: his tail was long and very graceful; his wings fit elegantly 
against his body and looked precisely the right size when fanned out. His colors had intensified, the 
black hide turning hard and glossy save for the soft nose, and the blue and pale grey markings on the 
edges of his wings spreading and becoming opalescent. To Laurence’s partial eye, he was the 
handsomest dragon in the entire covert, even without the great shining pearl blazoned upon his chest. 
The constant occupation, along with the rapid growth, had at least temporarily eased Temeraire’s 
unhappiness. He was now larger than any of the other dragons but Maximus; even Lily was shorter than 
he was, though her wingspan was still greater. Though Temeraire did not push himself forward and was 
not given precedence by the feeders, Laurence saw on the occasions when he observed that most of the 
other dragons did unconsciously give way to him at feeding times, and if Temeraire did not come to be 
friendly with any of them, he seemed too busy to pay it mind, much as Laurence himself with the other 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (102 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
aviators. 
For the most part, they were company for each other; they were rarely apart except while eating or 
sleeping, and Laurence honestly felt little need of other society. Indeed, he was glad enough for the 
excuse, which enabled him to avoid Rankin’s company almost entirely. By answering with reserve on all 
occasions when he was not able to do so, he felt he had at least halted the progress of their acquaintance, 
if not partly undone it. His and Temeraire’s acquaintance with Maximus and Berkley progressed, at 
least, which kept them from being wholly isolated from their fellows, though Temeraire continued to 
prefer sleeping outside on the grounds, rather than in the courtyard with the other dragons. 
They had already been assigned Temeraire’s ground crew: besides Hollin as the head, Pratt and Bell, 
armorer and leatherworker respectively, formed the core, along with the gunner Calloway. Many 
dragons had no more, but as Temeraire continued to grow, the masters were somewhat grudgingly 
granted assistants: first one and then a second for each, until Temeraire’s complement was only a few 
men short of Maximus’s. The harness-master’s name was Fellowes; he was a silent but dependable man, 
with some ten years of experience in his line, and more to the point skillful at coaxing additional men 
out of the Corps; he managed to get Laurence eight harness-men. They were badly wanted, as Laurence 
persisted in having Temeraire out of the gear whenever possible; he needed the full harness put on and 
off far more often than most dragons. 
Save for these hands, the rest of Temeraire’s crew would be composed entirely of officers, gentlemen 
born; and even the hands were the equivalent of warrant officers or their mates. It was strange to 
Laurence, used to commanding ten raw landsmen to every able seaman. There was none of the bosun’s 
brutal discipline here; such men could not be struck or started, and the worst punishment was to turn a 
man off. Laurence could not deny he liked it better, though he felt unhappily disloyal at admitting of any 
fault in the Navy, even to himself. 
Nor was there any fault to be found in the caliber of his officers, as he had imagined; at least, not more 
than in his prior experience. Half of his riflemen were completely raw midwingmen who had barely yet 
learned which end of a gun to hold; however, they seemed willing enough, and were improving quickly: 
Collins was overeager but had a good eye, and if Donnell and Dunne still had some difficulty in finding 
the target, they were at least quick in reloading. Their lieutenant, Riggs, was somewhat unfortunate: 
hasty-tempered and excitable, given to bellowing at small mistakes; he was himself a fine shot, and 
knew his work, but Laurence would have preferred a steadier man to guide the others. But he did not 
have free choice of men; Riggs had seniority and had served with distinction, so at least merited his 
position, which made him superior to several officers with whom Laurence had been forced to serve in 
the Navy. 
The permanent aerial crew, the topmen and bellmen responsible for managing Temeraire’s equipage 
during flight, and the senior officers and lookouts, were not yet settled. Most of the currently unassigned 
junior officers at the covert would first be given a chance to take positions upon Temeraire during the 
course of his training before final assignment was made; Celeritas had explained that this was a common 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (103 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
technique used to ensure that the aviators practiced handling as many types of dragon as possible, as the 
techniques varied greatly depending on the breed. Martin had done well in his stint, and Laurence had 
hopes that he might be able to get the young midwingman a permanent berth; several other promising 
young men had also recommended themselves to him. 
The only matter of real concern to him was the question of his first lieutenant. He had been disappointed 
in the first three candidates assigned him: all were adequate, but none of them struck him as gifted, and 
he was particular for Temeraire’s sake, even if he would not have been for his own. More unpleasantly, 
Granby had just been assigned in his turn, and though the lieutenant was executing his duties in perfect 
order, he was always addressing Laurence as “sir” and pointedly making his obedience at every turn; it 
was an obvious contrast with the behavior of the other officers, and made them all uneasy. Laurence 
could not help but think with regret of Tom Riley. 
That aside, he was satisfied, though increasingly eager to be done with maneuver drills; fortunately 
Celeritas had pronounced Temeraire and Maximus almost ready to join the formation. There were only 
the last complex maneuvers to be mastered, those flown entirely upside down; the two dragons were in 
the midst of practicing these in a clear morning when Temeraire remarked to Laurence, “That is Volly 
over there, coming towards us,” and Laurence lifted his head to see a small grey speck winging its way 
rapidly to the covert. 
Volly sailed directly into the valley and landed in the training courtyard, a violation of the covert rules 
when a practice was in session, and Captain James leapt off his dragon’s back to talk to Celeritas. 
Interested, Temeraire righted himself and stopped in mid-air to watch, tumbling about all the crew 
except Laurence, who was by now used to the maneuver; Maximus kept going a little longer until he 
noticed that he was alone, then turned and flew back despite Berkley’s roared protests. 
“What do you suppose it is?” Maximus asked in his rumbling voice; unable to hover himself, he was 
obliged to fly in circles. 
“Listen, you great lummox; if it is any of your affair you will be told,” Berkley said. “Will you get back 
to maneuvers?” 
“I do not know; perhaps we could ask Volly,” Temeraire said. “And there is no sense in our doing 
maneuvers anymore; we already know all of these,” he added. He sounded so mulish that Laurence was 
startled; he leaned forward, frowning, but before he could speak, Celeritas called them in, urgently. 
“There has been an air battle in the North Sea, off Aberdeen,” he said with no preliminaries, when they 
had scarcely landed. “Several dragons of the covert outside Edinburgh responded to distress signals from 
the city; though they drove off the French attack, Victoriatus was wounded. He is very weak and having 
difficulty staying in the air: the two of you are large enough to help support him and bring him in more 
quickly. Volatilus and Captain James will lead you; go at once.”

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Volly took the lead and flew off at a tearing speed, showing them his heels easily: he kept only just 
within the limits of their sight. Maximus could not keep up even with Temeraire, however, so with flag-
signals and some hasty shouting back and forth through the speaking-trumpets, Berkley and Laurence 
agreed that Temeraire would go on ahead, and his crew would send up regular flares to mark the 
direction for Maximus. 
The arrangements made, Temeraire pulled away very rapidly; going, Laurence thought, a little too fast. 
The distance was not very great as the dragon flew; Aberdeen was some 120 miles distant, and the other 
dragons would be coming towards them, closing the distance from the other side. Still, they would need 
to be able to fly the same distance again to bring Victoriatus in, and even though they would be flying 
over land, not ocean, they could not land and rest with the wounded dragon leaning upon them: there 
would be no getting him off the ground again. Some moderation of speed would be necessary. 
Laurence glanced down at the chronometer strapped down to Temeraire’s harness, waited for the minute 
hand to shift, then counted wingbeats. Twenty-five knots: too high. “Gently, if you please, Temeraire,” 
he called. “We have a good deal of work ahead of us.” 
“I am not tired at all,” Temeraire said, but he slowed regardless; Laurence made his new speed as fifteen 
knots: a good pace, and one that Temeraire could sustain almost indefinitely. 
“Pass the word for Mr. Granby,” Laurence said; shortly, the lieutenant clambered forward to Laurence’s 
position at the base of Temeraire’s neck, swapping carabiners quickly to move himself along. “What is 
your estimate of the best rate the injured dragon can be maintaining?” Laurence asked him. 
For once, Granby did not respond with cold formality, but thoughtfully; all the aviators had immediately 
become very grave on the moment of hearing of the injured dragon. “Victoriatus is a Parnassian,” he 
said. “A large mid-weight: heavier than a Reaper. They don’t have heavy-combat dragons at Edinburgh, 
so the others supporting him must be mid-weights; they cannot be making more than twelve miles per 
hour.” 
Laurence paused to convert between knots and miles, then nodded; Temeraire was going almost twice as 
quickly, then. Taking into account Volly’s speed in bringing the message, they had perhaps three hours 
before they would need to start looking for the other party. “Very good. We may as well use the time; 
have the topmen and bellmen exchange places for practice, and then I think we will try some gunnery.” 
He felt quite calm and settled himself, but he could feel Temeraire’s excitement transmitting itself 
through a faint twitching along the back of his neck; of course this was Temeraire’s first action, of any 
sort, and Laurence stroked the twitching ridge soothingly. He swapped around his carabiners and turned 
to observe the maneuvers he had ordered. In sequence, a topman climbed down to the belly-rigging at 
the same time as a bellman climbed up to the back on the other side, the two weights balancing each 
other. As the man who had just climbed up locked himself into place, he tugged on the signal-strap, 
colored in alternating sections of black and white, and pulled it ahead a section; in a moment it advanced

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
again, indicating that the man below had locked himself in as well. All went smoothly: Temeraire was 
presently carrying three topmen and three bellmen, and the exchange took less than five minutes all told. 
“Mr. Allen,” Laurence said sharply, calling one of the lookouts to order: an older cadet, soon to be made 
ensign, neglecting his duty to watch the other men at their work. “Can you tell me what is in the upper 
north-west? No, do not turn round and look; you must be able to answer that question the moment it is 
asked. I will speak with your instructor; mind your work now.” 
The riflemen took up their positions, and Laurence nodded to Granby to give the order; the topmen 
began throwing out the flat ceramic disks used for targeting, and the riflemen took turns attempting to 
shoot them out of the air as they flew past. Laurence watched and frowned. “Mr. Granby, Mr. Riggs, I 
make twelve targets out of twenty; you concur? Gentlemen, I hope I need not say that this will not do 
against French sharpshooters. Let us begin again, at a slower rate: precision first, speed second, Mr. 
Collins, so pray do not be so hasty.” 
He kept them at it for a full hour, then had the hands go through the complicated harness adjustments for 
storm flying; afterwards he himself went down below and observed the men stationed below while they 
reverted to fair-weather rigging. They did not have the tents aboard, so he could not have them practice 
going to quarters and breaking down full gear, but they did well enough at the rigging changes, and he 
thought they would have done well even with the additional equipment. 
Temeraire occasionally glanced around to watch throughout these maneuvers, his eyes bright; but for the 
most part he was intent on his flying, rising and falling in the air to catch the best currents, driving 
himself forward with great steady beats, each thrust fully carried through. Laurence laid his hand upon 
the long, ropy muscles of Temeraire’s neck, feeling them move smoothly as though oiled beneath the 
skin, and was not tempted to distract him with conversation; there was no need. He knew without 
speaking that Temeraire shared his satisfaction at putting their joint training to real purpose at last. 
Laurence had not wholly realized his own sense of quiet frustration to have been in some sense demoted 
from a serving officer to a schoolboy, until he now found himself again engaged in active duty. 
The three hours were nearly up by the chronometer, and it was time to begin preparing to give support to 
the injured dragon; Maximus was perhaps half an hour behind them, and Temeraire would have to carry 
Victoriatus alone until the Regal Copper caught up. “Mr. Granby,” Laurence said, as he latched himself 
back in to his normal position at the base of the neck, “let us clear the back; all the men below, save for 
the signal-ensign and the forward lookouts.” 
“Very good, sir,” Granby said, nodding, and turned at once to arrange it. Laurence watched him work 
with mingled satisfaction and irritation. For the first time in the past week, Granby had been going about 
his duties without that air of stiff resentment, and Laurence could easily perceive the effects: the speed 
of nearly every operation improved; myriad small defects in harness placement and crew positioning, 
previously invisible to his own inexperienced eye, now corrected; the atmosphere among the men more 
relaxed. All the many ways in which an excellent first lieutenant could improve the life of a crew, and

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Granby was now proven capable of them all, but that only made his earlier attitude more regrettable. 
Volatilus turned and came flying back towards them only shortly after they had cleared the top; James 
pulled him about and cupped his hands around his mouth to call to Laurence. “I’ve sighted them, two 
points to the north and twelve degrees down; you’ll need to drop to come up under them, for I don’t 
think he can get any more elevation.” He signaled the numbers with hand gestures as he spoke. 
“Very good,” Laurence called back, through his speaking-trumpet, and had the signal-ensign wave a 
confirmation with flags; Temeraire was large enough now that Volly could not get so close as to make 
verbal communication certain. 
Temeraire stooped into a dive at his quick signal, and very soon Laurence saw a speck on the horizon 
rapidly enlarge into the group of dragons. Victoriatus was instantly identifiable; he was larger by half 
than either of the two Yellow Reapers struggling to keep him aloft. Though the injuries were already 
under thick bandages applied by his crew, blood had seeped through showing the slashing marks where 
the dragon had evidently taken blows from the enemy beasts. The Parnassian’s own claws were 
unusually large, and stained with blood as well; his jaws also. The smaller dragons below looked 
crowded, and there was no one aboard the injured dragon but his captain and perhaps half a dozen men. 
“Signal the two supporters: prepare to stand aside,” Laurence said; the young signal-ensign waved the 
colored flags in rapid sequence, and a prompt acknowledgment came back. Temeraire had already flown 
around the group and positioned himself properly: he was just below and to the back of the second 
supporting dragon. 
“Temeraire, are you quite ready?” Laurence called. They had practiced this maneuver in training, but it 
would be unusually difficult to carry out here: the injured dragon was barely beating his wings, and his 
eyes were half-shut with pain and exhaustion; the two supporters were clearly worn out themselves. 
They would have to drop out of the way smoothly, and Temeraire dart in very quickly, to avoid having 
Victoriatus collapse into a deadly plummet that would be impossible to arrest. 
“Yes; please let us hurry, they look so very tired,” Temeraire said, glancing back. His muscles were 
tightly gathered, they had matched the others’ pace, and nothing more could be gained by waiting. 
“Signal: exchange positions on lead dragon’s mark,” Laurence said. The flags waved; the 
acknowledgment came. Then on both sides of the foremost of the two supporting dragons, the red flags 
went out, and then were swapped for the green. 
The rear dragon dropped and peeled aside swiftly as Temeraire lunged. But the forward dragon went a 
little too slowly, his wings stuttering, and Victoriatus began to tilt forward as the Reaper tried to descend 
away and make room. “Dive, damn you, dive!” Laurence roared at the top of his lungs; the smaller 
dragon’s lashing tail was dangerously near Temeraire’s head, and they could not move into place. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (107 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
The Reaper gave up the maneuver and simply folded his wings; he dropped out of the way like a stone. 
“Temeraire, you must get him up a little so you can come forward,” Laurence shouted again, crouched 
low against the neck; Victoriatus’s hindquarters had settled over Temeraire’s shoulders instead of further 
back, and the great belly was less than three feet overhead, barely kept up by the injured dragon’s 
waning strength. 
Temeraire showed with a bob of his head that he had heard and understood; he beat up rapidly at an 
angle, pushing the slumping Parnassian back up higher through sheer strength, then snapped his wings 
closed. A brief, sickening drop: then his wings fanned out again. With a single great thrust, Temeraire 
had himself properly positioned, and Victoriatus came heavily down upon them again. 
Laurence had a moment of relief; then Temeraire cried out in pain. He turned and saw in horror that in 
his confusion and agony, Victoriatus was scrabbling at Temeraire, and the great claws had raked 
Temeraire’s shoulder and side. Above, muffled, he heard the other captain shouting; Victoriatus stopped, 
but Temeraire was already bleeding, and straps of the harness were hanging loose and flapping in the 
wind. 
They were losing elevation rapidly; Temeraire was struggling to keep flying under the other dragon’s 
weight. Laurence fought with his carabiners, yelling at the signal-ensign to let the men below know. The 
boy scrambled partway down the neck-strap, waving the white-and-red flag wildly; in a moment 
Laurence gratefully saw Granby climbing up with two other men to bandage the wounds, reaching the 
gashes more quickly than he could. He stroked Temeraire, called reassurance to him in a voice that 
struggled not to break; Temeraire did not spare the effort to turn and reply, but bravely kept beating his 
wings, though his head was drooping with the strain. 
“Not deep,” Granby shouted, from where they worked to pad the gashes, and Laurence could breathe 
and think clearly again. The harness was shifting upon Temeraire’s back; aside from a great deal of 
lesser rigging, the main shoulder-strap had been nearly cut through, saved only by the wires that ran 
through it. But the leather was parting, and as soon as it went the wires would break under the strain of 
all the men and gear currently riding below. 
“All of you; take off your harnesses and pass them to me,” Laurence said to the signal-ensign and the 
lookouts; the three boys were the only ones left above, besides him. “Take a good grip on the main 
harness and get your arms or legs tucked beneath.” The leather of the personal harnesses was thick, 
solidly stitched, well-oiled; the carabiners were solid steel: not quite as strong as the main harness, but 
nearly so. 
He slung the three harnesses over his arm and clambered along the back-strap to the broader part of the 
shoulders. Granby and the two midwingmen were still working on the injuries to Temeraire’s side; they 
spared him a puzzled look, and Laurence realized they could not see the nearly severed shoulder-band: it 
was hidden from their view by Temeraire’s foreleg. There was no time to call them forward to help in 
any case; the band was rapidly beginning to give way. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (108 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
He could not come at it normally; if he tried to put his weight on any of the rings along the shoulder-
band, it would certainly break at once. Working as quickly as he could under the roaring pressure of the 
wind, he hooked two of the harnesses together by their carabiners, then looped them around the back-
strap. “Temeraire, stay as level as you can,” he shouted; then, clinging to the ends of the harnesses, he 
unlocked his own carabiners and climbed carefully out onto the shoulder, held by nothing more secure 
than his grip on the leather. 
Granby was shouting something at him; the wind was tearing it away, and he could not make out the 
words. Laurence tried to keep his eyes fixed on the straps; the ground below was the beautiful, fresh 
green of early spring, strangely calm and pastoral: they were low enough that he could see white dots of 
sheep. He was in arm’s reach now; with a hand that shook slightly, he latched the first carabiner of the 
third loose harness onto the ring just above the cut, and the second onto the ring just below. He pulled on 
the straps, throwing his weight against them as much as he dared; his arms ached and trembled as if with 
high fever. Inch by inch, he drew the small harness tighter, until at last the portion between the 
carabiners was the same size as the cut portion of the band and was taking much of its weight: the 
leather stopped fraying away. 
He looked up; Granby was slowly climbing towards him, snapping onto rings as he came. Now that the 
harness was in place, the strain was not an immediate danger, so Laurence did not wave him off, but 
only shouted, “Call up Mr. Fellowes,” the harness-master, and pointed to the spot. Granby’s eyes 
widened as he came over the foreleg and saw the broken strap. 
As Granby turned to signal below for help, bright sunlight abruptly fell full on his face; Victoriatus was 
shuddering above them, wings convulsing, and the Parnassian’s chest came heavily down on 
Temeraire’s back. Temeraire staggered in mid-air, one shoulder dipping under the blow, and Laurence 
was sliding along the linked harness straps, wet palms giving him no purchase. The green world was 
spinning beneath him, and his hands were already tired and slick with sweat; his grip was failing. 
“Laurence, hold on!” Temeraire called, head turned to look back at him; his muscles and wing-joints 
were shifting as he prepared to snatch Laurence out of the air. 
“You must not let him fall,” Laurence shouted, horrified; Temeraire could not try to catch him except by 
tipping Victoriatus off his back, and sending the Parnassian to his death. “Temeraire, you must not!” 
“Laurence!” Temeraire cried again, his claws flexing; his eyes were wide and distressed, and his head 
waved back and forth in denial. Laurence could see he did not mean to obey. He struggled to keep hold 
of the leather straps, to try and climb up; if he fell, it was not only his own life which would be forfeit, 
but the injured dragon and all his crew still aboard. 
Granby was there suddenly, seizing Laurence’s harness in both his hands. “Lock onto me,” he shouted. 
Laurence saw at once what he meant. With one hand still clinging to the linked harnesses, he locked his 
loose carabiners onto the rings of Granby’s harness, then transferred his grip to Granby’s chest-straps. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (109 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Then the midwingmen reached them; all at once there were many strong hands grabbing at them, 
drawing Laurence and Granby back up together to the main harness, and they held Laurence in place 
while he locked his carabiners back onto the proper rings. 
He could scarcely breathe yet, but he seized his speaking-trumpet and called urgently, “All is well.” His 
voice was hardly audible; he pulled in a deep breath and tried again, more clearly this time: “I am fine, 
Temeraire; only keep flying.” The tense muscles beneath them unwound slowly, and Temeraire beat up 
again, regaining a little of the elevation they had lost. The whole process had lasted perhaps fifteen 
minutes; he was shaking as if he had been on deck throughout a three-day gale, and his heart was 
thundering in his breast. 
Granby and the midwingmen looked scarcely more composed. “Well done, gentlemen,” Laurence said 
to them, as soon as he trusted his voice to remain steady. “Let us give Mr. Fellowes room to work. Mr. 
Granby, be so good as to send someone up to Victoriatus’s captain and see what assistance we can 
provide; we must take what precautions we can to keep him from further starts.” 
They gaped at him a moment; Granby was the first to recover his wits, and began issuing orders. By the 
time Laurence had made his way, very cautiously, back to his post at the base of Temeraire’s neck, the 
midwingmen were wrapping Victoriatus’s claws with bandages to prevent him from scratching 
Temeraire again, and Maximus was coming into sight in the distance, hurrying to their assistance. 
  
The rest of the flight was relatively uneventful, if the effort involved in supporting a nearly unconscious 
dragon through the air were ever to be considered ordinary. As soon as they landed Victoriatus safely in 
the courtyard, the surgeons came hurrying to see to both him and Temeraire; to Laurence’s great relief, 
the cuts indeed proved quite shallow. They were cleaned and inspected, pronounced minor, and a loose 
pad placed over them to keep the torn hide from being irritated; then Temeraire was set loose and 
Laurence told to let him sleep and eat as much as he liked for a week. 
It was not the most pleasant way to win a few days of liberty, but the respite was infinitely welcome. 
Laurence immediately walked Temeraire to an open clearing near the covert, not wanting to strain him 
by another leap aloft. Though the clearing was upon the mountain, it was relatively level, and covered in 
soft green grass; it faced south, and the sun came into it nearly the entire day. There the two of them 
slept together from that afternoon until late in the next, Laurence stretched out upon Temeraire’s warm 
back, until hunger woke them both. 
“I feel much better; I am sure I can hunt quite normally,” Temeraire said; Laurence would not hear of it. 
He walked back up to the workshops and roused the ground crew instead. Very shortly they had driven a 
small group of cattle up from the pens and slaughtered them; Temeraire devoured every last scrap and 
fell directly back to sleep. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (110 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Laurence a little diffidently asked Hollin to arrange for the servants to bring him some food; it was 
enough like asking the man for personal service to make Laurence uncomfortable, but he was reluctant 
to leave Temeraire. Hollin took no offense; but when he returned, Lieutenant Granby was with him, 
along with Riggs and a couple of the other lieutenants. 
“You should go and have something hot to eat, and a bath, and then sleep in your own bed,” Granby said 
quietly, having waved the others off a little distance. “You are all over blood, and it is not warm enough 
yet for you to sleep outside without risk to your health. I and the other officers will take it in turns to stay 
with him; we will fetch you at once if he wakes, or if any change should occur.” 
Laurence blinked and looked down at himself; he had not even noticed that his clothes were spattered 
and streaked with the near-black of dragon blood. He ran a hand over his unshaven face; he was clearly 
presenting a rather horrible picture to the world. He looked up at Temeraire; the dragon was completely 
unaware of his surroundings, sides rising and falling with a low, steady rumble. “I dare say you are 
right,” he said. “Very well; and thank you,” he added. 
Granby nodded; and with a last look up at the sleeping Temeraire, Laurence took himself back to the 
castle. Now that it had been brought to mind, the sensation of dirt and sweat was unpleasant upon his 
skin; he had gotten soft, with the luxury of daily bathing at hand. He stopped by his room only long 
enough to exchange his stained clothes for fresh, and went straight to the baths. 
It was shortly after dinner, and many of the officers had a habit of bathing at this hour; after Laurence 
had taken a quick plunge into the pool, he found the sweat-room very crowded. But as he came in, 
several fellows made room for him; he gladly took the opened place, and returned the nods of greeting 
around the room before he laid himself down. He was so tired that it only occurred to him after his eyes 
were closed in the blissful heat that the attention had been unusual, and marked; he almost sat up again 
with surprise. 
“Well flown; very well flown, Captain,” Celeritas told him that evening, approvingly, when he belatedly 
came to report. “No, you need not apologize for being tardy. Lieutenant Granby has given me a 
preliminary account, and with Captain Berkley’s report I know well enough what happened. We prefer a 
captain be more concerned for his dragon than for our bureaucracy. I trust Temeraire is doing well?” 
“Thank you, sir, yes,” Laurence said gratefully. “The surgeons have told me there is no cause for alarm, 
and he says he is quite comfortable. Have you any duties for me during his recovery?” 
“Nothing other than to keep him occupied, which you may find enough of a challenge,” Celeritas said, 
with the snort that passed for a chuckle with him. “Well, that is not quite true; I do have one task for 
you. Once Temeraire is recovered, you and Maximus will be joining Lily’s formation straightaway. We 
have had nothing but bad news from the war, and the latest is worse: Villeneuve and his fleet have 
slipped out of Toulon under cover of an aerial raid against Nelson’s fleet; we have lost track of them. 
Under the circumstances, and given this lost week, we cannot wait any longer. Therefore it is time to 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (111 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
assign your flight crew, and I would like your requests. Consider the men who have served with you 
these last weeks, and we will discuss the matter tomorrow.” 
Laurence walked slowly back out to the clearing after this, deep in thought. He had begged a tent from 
the ground crews and brought along a blanket; he thought he would be quite comfortable once he had 
pitched it by Temeraire’s side, and he liked the idea better than spending the whole night away. He 
found Temeraire still sleeping peacefully, the flesh around the bandaged area only ordinarily warm to 
the touch. 
Having satisfied himself on this point, Laurence said, “A word with you, Mr. Granby,” and led the 
lieutenant some short distance away. “Celeritas has asked me to name my officers,” he said, looking 
steadily at Granby; the young man flushed and looked down. Laurence continued, “I will not put you in 
the position of refusing a post; I do not know what that means in the Corps, but I know in the Navy it 
would be a serious mark against you. If you would have the least objection, speak frankly; that will be 
an end to the matter.” 
“Sir,” Granby began, then shut his mouth abruptly, looking mortified: he had used the term so often in 
veiled insolence. He started over again. “Captain, I am well aware I have done little enough to deserve 
such consideration; I can only say that if you are willing to overlook what my past behavior has been, I 
would be very glad of the opportunity.” This speech was a little stilted in his mouth, as if he had tried to 
rehearse it. 
Laurence nodded, satisfied. His decision had been a near thing; if it had not been for Temeraire’s sake, 
he was not sure he could have borne to thus expose himself to a man who had behaved disrespectfully 
towards him, despite Granby’s recent heroics. But Granby was so clearly the best of the lot that 
Laurence had decided to take the risk. He was well-pleased with the reply; it was fair enough and 
respectful even if awkwardly delivered. “Very good,” he said simply. 
They had just begun walking back when Granby suddenly said, “Oh, damn it; I may not be able to word 
it properly, but I cannot just leave things at that: I have to tell you how very sorry I am. I know I have 
been playing the scrub.” 
Laurence was surprised by his frankness, but not displeased, and he could never have refused an apology 
offered with so much sincerity and feeling as was obvious in Granby’s tone. “I am very happy to accept 
your apology,” he said, quietly but with real warmth. “For my part, all is forgotten, I assure you, and I 
hope that henceforth we may be better comrades than we have been.” 
They stopped and shook hands; Granby looked both relieved and happy, and when Laurence tentatively 
inquired for his recommendations for other officers, he answered with great enthusiasm, as they made 
their way back towards Temeraire’s side.

Chapter 8 
 
EVEN BEFORE THE pad of bandages had come off, Temeraire began to make plaintive noises about 
wanting to be bathed again; by the end of the week, the cuts were scabbed over and healing, and the 
surgeons gave grudging approval. Having rounded up what he already thought of as his cadets, Laurence 
came out to the courtyard to take the waiting Temeraire down, and found him talking with the female 
Longwing whose formation they would be joining. 
“Does it hurt when you spray?” Temeraire was asking inquisitively. Laurence could see that Temeraire 
was inspecting the pitted bone spurs on either side of her jaw, evidently where the acid was ejected. 
“No, I do not feel it in the least,” Lily answered. “The spray will only come out if I am pointing my head 
down, so I do not splash myself, either; although of course you all must be careful to avoid it when we 
are in formation.” 
The enormous wings were folded against her back, looking brown with the translucent folds of blue and 
orange overlapping each other; only the black-and-white edges stood out against her sides. Her eyes 
were slit-pupiled, like Temeraire’s, but orange-yellow, and the exposed bone spurs showing on either 
side of her jaw gave her a very savage appearance. But she stood with perfect patience while her ground 
crew scrambled over her, polishing and cleaning every scrap of harness with great attention; Captain 
Harcourt was walking back and forth around her and inspecting the work. 
Lily looked down at Laurence as he came to Temeraire’s side; her alarming eyes gave her stare a baleful 
quality, although she was only curious. “Are you Temeraire’s captain? Catherine, shall we not go to the 
lake with them? I am not sure I want to go in the water, but I would like to see.” 
“Go to the lake?” Captain Harcourt was drawn from her inspection of the harness by the suggestion, and 
she stared at Laurence in open astonishment. 
“Yes; I am taking Temeraire to bathe,” Laurence said firmly. “Mr. Hollin, let us have the light harness, 
if you please, and see if we cannot rig it to keep the straps well away from these cuts.” 
Hollin was working on cleaning Levitas’s harness; the little dragon had just come back from eating. 
“You’ll be going along?” he asked Levitas. “If so, sir, maybe there’s no need to put any gear on 
Temeraire?” he added to Laurence. 
“Oh, I would like to,” Levitas said, looking at Laurence hopefully, as if for permission.

“Thank you, Levitas,” Laurence said, by way of answer. “That will be an excellent solution; gentlemen, 
Levitas will take you down again this time,” he told the cadets; he had long since given up trying to alter 
his address on Roland’s behalf; as she seemed perfectly able to count herself included regardless, it was 
easier to treat her just as the others. “Temeraire, shall I ride with them, or will you carry me?” 
“I will carry you, of course,” Temeraire said. 
Laurence nodded. “Mr. Hollin, are you otherwise occupied? Your assistance would be helpful, and 
Levitas can certainly manage you if Temeraire carries me.” 
“Why, I would be happy, sir, but I haven’t a harness,” Hollin said, eyeing Levitas with interest. “I have 
never been up before; I mean, not outside the ground-crew rigging, that is. I suppose I can cobble 
something together out of a spare, though, if you give me a moment.” 
While Hollin was working on rigging himself out, Maximus descended into the courtyard, shaking the 
ground as he landed. “Are you ready?” he asked Temeraire, looking pleased; Berkley was on his back, 
along with a couple of midwingmen. 
“He has been moaning about it so long I have given in,” Berkley said, in answer to Laurence’s amused 
and questioning look. “Damned foolish idea if you ask me, dragons swimming; great nonsense.” He 
thumped Maximus’s shoulder affectionately, belying his words. 
“We are coming also,” Lily said; she and Captain Harcourt had held a quiet discussion while the rest of 
the party assembled, and now she lifted Captain Harcourt aboard onto her harness. Temeraire picked 
Laurence up carefully; despite the great talons Laurence had not the least concern. He was perfectly 
comfortable in the enclosure of the curving fingers; he could sit in the palm and be as protected as in a 
metal cage. 
Once down by the shore, only Temeraire went directly into the deep water and began to swim. Maximus 
came tentatively into the shallows, but went no further than he could stand, and Lily stood on the shore 
watching, nosing at the water but not going in. Levitas, as was his habit, first wavered on the shore, and 
then dashed out all at once, splashing and flapping wildly with his eyes tightly shut until he got out to 
the deeper water and began to paddle around enthusiastically. 
“Do we need to go in with them?” one of Berkley’s midwingmen asked, with a certain tone of alarm. 
“No, do not even contemplate it,” Laurence said. “This lake is runoff from the mountain snows, and we 
would turn blue in a moment. But the swim will take away the worst of the dirt and blood from their 
feeding, and the rest will be much easier to clean once they have soaked a little.” 
“Hm,” Lily said, listening to this, and very slowly crept out into the water.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Are you quite sure it is not too cold for you, dearest?” Harcourt called after her. “I have never heard of 
a dragon catching an ague; I suppose it is out of the question?” she said to Laurence and Berkley. 
“No, cold just wakes ’em up, unless it is freezing weather; that they don’t care for,” Berkley said, then 
raised his voice to bellow, “Maximus, you great coward, go in if you mean to; I am not going to stand 
here all day.” 
“I am not afraid,” Maximus said indignantly, and lunged forward, sending out a great wave that briefly 
swamped Levitas and washed over Temeraire. Levitas came up with a splutter, and Temeraire snorted 
and ducked his head into the water to splash at Maximus; in a moment the two were engaged in a royal 
battle that bid fair to make the lake look like the Atlantic in a full gale. 
Levitas came fluttering out of the lake, dripping cold water onto all of the waiting aviators. Hollin and 
the cadets set to wiping him down, and the little dragon said, “Oh, I do like swimming so; thank you for 
letting me come again.” 
“I do not see why you cannot come as often as you like,” Laurence said, glancing at Berkley and 
Harcourt to see how they would take this; neither of them seemed to give it the slightest thought, or to 
think his interference officious. 
Lily had at last gone in deep enough to be mostly submerged, or at least as much as her natural 
buoyancy would allow. She stayed well away from the splashing pair of younger dragons, and scrubbed 
at her own hide with the side of her head. She came out next, more interested in being washed than in 
the swimming, and rumbled in pleasure as she pointed out spots and had them carefully cleaned by 
Harcourt and the cadets. 
Maximus and Temeraire finally had enough, and came out to be wiped down as well. Maximus required 
all the exertions of Berkley and his two grown midwingmen. Working on the delicate skin of 
Temeraire’s face while the cadets scrambled all over his back, Laurence could not hide a smile at 
Berkley’s grumbling over his dragon’s size. 
He stepped back from his work a moment to simply enjoy the scene: Temeraire was speaking with the 
other dragons freely, his eyes bright and his head held proudly, with no more signs of self-doubt; and 
even if this strange, mixed company was not anything Laurence would once have sought out for himself, 
the easy camaraderie warmed him through. He was conscious of having proven himself and having 
helped Temeraire to do the same, and of the deep satisfaction of having found a true and worthy place, 
for the both of them. 
  
The pleasure lasted until their return to the courtyard. Rankin was standing by the side of the courtyard, 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (115 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
wearing evening dress and tapping the straps of his personal harness against the side of his leg in very 
obvious irritation, and Levitas gave a little alarmed hop as he landed. “What do you mean by flying off 
like this?” Rankin said, not even waiting for Hollin and the cadets to climb down. “When you are not 
feeding, you are to be here and waiting, do you understand me? And you there, who told you that you 
could ride him?” 
“Levitas was kind enough to bear them to oblige me, Captain Rankin,” Laurence said, stepping out of 
Temeraire’s hand and speaking sharply to draw the man’s attention away. “We have only been down at 
the lake, and a signal would have fetched us in a moment.” 
“I do not care to be running after signal-men to have my dragon available, Captain Laurence, and I will 
thank you to mind your own beast and leave mine to me,” Rankin said, very coldly. “I suppose you are 
wet now?” he added to Levitas. 
“No, no; I am sure I am mostly dry, I was not in for very long at all, I promise,” Levitas said, hunching 
himself very small. 
“Let us hope so,” Rankin said. “Bend down, hurry up about it. And you lot are to stay away from him 
from now on,” he told the cadets as he climbed up in their place, nearly shouldering Hollin aside. 
Laurence stood watching Levitas fly away with Rankin on his back; Berkley and Captain Harcourt were 
silent, as were the other dragons. Lily abruptly turned her head and made an angry spitting noise; only a 
few droplets fell, but they sizzled and smoked upon the stone, leaving deep black pockmarks. 
“Lily!” Captain Harcourt said, but there was a quality of relief in her voice at the break in the silence. 
“Pray bring some harness oil, Peck,” she said to one of her ground crewmen, climbing down; she poured 
it liberally over the acid droplets, until smoke ceased rising. “There, cover it with some sand, and 
tomorrow it should be safe to wash.” 
Laurence was also glad for the small distraction; he did not immediately trust himself to speak. 
Temeraire nuzzled him gently, and the cadets looked at him in worry. “I oughtn’t ever have suggested it, 
sir,” Hollin said. “I’m sure I beg your pardon, and Captain Rankin’s.” 
“Not in the least, Mr. Hollin,” Laurence said; he could hear his own voice, cold and very stern, and he 
tried to mitigate the effect by adding, “You have done nothing wrong whatsoever.” 
“I don’t see any reason why we ought to stay away from Levitas,” Roland said, low. 
Laurence did not hesitate for a moment in his response; it was as strong and automatic as his own 
helpless anger against Rankin. “Your superior officer has given you orders to do so, Miss Roland; if that 
is not reason enough you are in the wrong service,” he snapped. “Let me never hear you make another 
such remark. Take these linens back to the laundry at once, if you please. You will pardon me, 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (116 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
gentlemen,” he added to the others, “I will go for a walk before supper.” 
Temeraire was too large to successfully creep after him, so the dragon resorted instead to flying past and 
waiting for him in the first small clearing along his path. Laurence had thought he wanted to be alone, 
but he found he was very glad to come into the dragon’s encircling forearms and lean upon his warm 
bulk, listening to the almost musical thrumming of his heart and the steady reverberation of his 
breathing. The anger slipped away, but it left misery in its place. He would have desperately liked to call 
Rankin out. 
“I do not know why Levitas endures it; even if he is small, he is still much bigger than Rankin,” 
Temeraire said eventually. 
“Why do you endure it when I ask you to put on a harness, or perform some dangerous maneuver?” 
Laurence said. “It is his duty, and it is his habit. From the shell he has been raised to obey, and has 
suffered such treatment. He likely does not contemplate any alternative.” 
“But he sees you, and the other captains; no one else is treated so,” Temeraire said. He flexed his claws; 
they dug furrows in the ground. “I do not obey you because it is a habit and I cannot think for myself; I 
do it because I know you are worthy of being obeyed. You would never treat me unkindly, and you 
would not ask me to do something dangerous or unpleasant without cause.” 
“No, not without cause,” Laurence said. “But we are in a hard service, my dear, and we must sometimes 
be willing to bear a great deal.” He hesitated, then added gently, “I have been meaning to speak to you 
about it, Temeraire: you must promise me in future not to place my life above that of so many others. 
You must surely see that Victoriatus is far more necessary to the Corps than I could ever be, even if 
there were not his crew to consider also; you should never have contemplated risking their lives to save 
mine.” 
Temeraire curled more closely around him. “No, Laurence, I cannot promise such a thing,” he said. “I 
am sorry, but I will not lie to you: I could not have let you fall. You may value their lives above your 
own; I cannot do so, for to me you are worth far more than all of them. I will not obey you in such a 
case, and as for duty, I do not care for the notion a great deal, the more I see of it.” 
Laurence was not sure how to answer this; he could not deny that he was touched by the degree to which 
Temeraire valued him, yet it was also alarming to have the dragon express so plainly that he would 
follow orders or not as his own judgment decreed. Laurence trusted that judgment a great deal, but he 
felt again that he had made an inadequate effort to teach Temeraire the value of discipline and duty. “I 
wish I knew how to explain it to you properly,” he said, a little despairingly. “Perhaps I will try and find 
you some books on the subject.” 
“I suppose,” Temeraire said, for once dubious about reading something. “I do not think anything would 
persuade me to behave differently. In any case, I would much rather just avoid it ever happening again. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (117 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
It was very dreadful, and I was afraid I might not be able to catch you.” 
Laurence could smile at this. “On that point at least we are agreed, and I will gladly promise you to do 
my best to avoid any repetition.” 
  
Roland came running to fetch him the next morning; he had slept by Temeraire’s side again in the little 
tent. “Celeritas wants you, sir,” she said, and went back to the castle by his side, once he had put his 
neckcloth back on and restored his coat. Temeraire gave him a sleepy murmur of farewell, barely 
opening one eye before going back to sleep. As they walked, she ventured, “Captain, are you still angry 
at me?” 
“What?” he said, blankly; then he remembered, and said, “No, Roland; I am not angry with you. You do 
understand why you were wrong to speak so, I hope.” 
“Yes,” she said, and he was able to ignore that it came out a little doubtfully. “I did not speak to Levitas; 
but I could not help seeing he does not look very well this morning.” 
Laurence glanced at the Winchester as they walked through the courtyard; Levitas was curled in the 
back corner, far from the other dragons, and despite the early hour, he was not sleeping but staring dully 
at the ground. Laurence looked away; there was nothing to be done. 
“Run along, Roland,” Celeritas said, when she had brought Laurence to him. “Captain, I am sorry to 
have called you so early; first, is Temeraire well enough to resume his training, do you think?” 
“I believe so, sir; he is healing very quickly, and yesterday he flew down to the lake and back with no 
difficulty,” Laurence said. 
“Good, good.” Celeritas fell silent, and then he sighed. “Captain, I am obliged to order you not to 
interfere with Levitas any further,” he said. 
Laurence felt hot color come to his face. So Rankin had complained of him. And yet it was no more than 
he deserved; he would never have brooked such officious involvement in the running of his ship, or his 
management of Temeraire. The thing had been wrong, whatever justifications he had given himself, and 
anger was quickly subsumed in shame. “Sir, I apologize that you should have been put to the necessity 
of telling me so; I assure you it will not arise again.” 
Celeritas snorted; having delivered his rebuke, he seemed at no great pains to reinforce it. “Give me no 
assurances; you would lower yourself in my eyes if you could mean them with real honesty,” he said. “It 
is a great pity, and I am at fault as much as anyone. When I could not tolerate him myself, Aerial 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (118 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Command thought he might do as a courier, and set him to a Winchester; for his grandfather’s sake I 
could not bring myself to speak against it, though I knew better.” 
Comforting as it was to have the reprimand softened, Laurence was curious to understand what Celeritas 
meant by not being able to tolerate him; surely Aerial Command would never have proposed a fellow 
like Rankin as a handler to a dragon as extraordinary as the training master. “Did you know his 
grandfather well?” he asked, unable to resist making the tentative inquiry. 
“My first handler; his son also served with me,” Celeritas said briefly, turning his head aside; his head 
drooped. He recovered after a moment and added, “Well, I had hopes for the boy, but at his mother’s 
insistence he was not raised here, and his family gave him strange notions; he ought never have been an 
aviator, much less a captain. But now he is, and while Levitas obeys him, so he remains. I cannot allow 
you to interfere. You can imagine what it would mean if we allowed officers to meddle with one 
another’s beasts: lieutenants desperate to be captains could hardly resist the temptation to seduce away 
any dragon who was not blissfully happy, and we would have chaos.” 
Laurence bowed his head. “I understand perfectly, sir.” 
“In any case, I will be giving you more pressing matters to attend to, for today we will begin your 
integration into Lily’s formation,” Celeritas said. “Pray go and fetch Temeraire; the others will be here 
shortly.” 
Walking back out, Laurence was thoughtful. He had known, of course, that the larger breeds would 
outlive their handlers, when they were not killed in battle together; he had not considered that this would 
leave the dragons alone and without a partner afterwards, nor how they or Aerial Command would 
manage the situation. Of course it was in Britain’s best interests to have the dragon continue in service, 
with a new handler, but he also could not help but think the dragon himself would be happier so, with 
duties to occupy his thoughts and keep him from the kind of sorrow that Celeritas obviously still felt. 
Arriving once again at the clearing, Laurence looked at the sleeping Temeraire with concern. Of course 
there were many years before them, and the fortunes of war might easily make all such questions moot, 
but Temeraire’s future happiness was his responsibility, heavier by far to him than any estate could have 
been, and some time soon he would have to consider what provisions he could make to ensure it. A well-
chosen first lieutenant, perhaps, might step into his place, with Temeraire brought to the notion over the 
course of several years. 
“Temeraire,” he called, stroking the dragon’s nose; Temeraire opened his eyes and made a small rumble. 
“I am awake; are we flying again today?” he said, yawning enormously up at the sky and twitching his 
wings a little. 
“Yes, my dear,” Laurence said. “Come, we must get you back into your harness; I am sure Mr. Hollin 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (119 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
will have it ready for us.” 
  
The formation ordinarily flew in a wedge-shaped block that resembled nothing more than a flock of 
migrating geese, with Lily at the head. The Yellow Reapers Messoria and Immortalis filled the key 
flanking positions, providing the protective bulk to keep Lily from close-quarters attack, while the ends 
were held by the smaller but more agile Dulcia, a Grey Copper, and a Pascal’s Blue called Nitidus. All 
were full-grown, and all but Lily had previous combat experience; they had been especially chosen for 
this critical formation to support the young and inexperienced Longwing, and their captains and crews 
were rightly proud of their skill. 
Laurence had cause to be thankful for the endless labor and repetition of the last month and a half; if the 
maneuvers they had practiced for so long had not become by now second nature for Temeraire and 
Maximus, they could never have kept up with the practiced, effortless acrobatics of the others. The two 
larger dragons had been added into position so as to form a back row behind Lily, closing the formation 
into a triangle shape. In battle, their place would be to fend off any attempts to break up the formation, to 
defend it against attack from other heavy-combat-class dragons, and to carry the great loads of bombs 
that their crews would drop below upon those targets that had already been weakened by Lily’s acid. 
Laurence was very glad to see Temeraire admitted fully to the company of the other dragons of the 
formation, although none of the older dragons had the energy for much play outside their work. For the 
most part they lazed about during the scant idle hours, and only observed in tolerant amusement while 
Temeraire and Lily and Maximus talked and occasionally went aloft for a game of aerial tag. For his 
own part, Laurence also felt a great deal more welcome among the other aviators now, and discovered 
that he had without noticing it adjusted to the informality of their relations: the first time he found 
himself addressing Captain Harcourt as simply “Harcourt,” in a post-training discussion, he did not even 
realize he had done so until after the words were out of his mouth. 
The captains and first lieutenants generally held such discussions of strategy and tactics at dinnertime, or 
during the late evenings after the dragons had all fallen asleep. Laurence’s opinion was rarely solicited 
in these conversations, but he did not take that greatly to heart: though he was quickly coming to grasp 
the principles of aerial warfare, he still considered himself a newcomer to the art, and he could hardly 
take offense at the aviators doing the same. Save when he could contribute some information about 
Temeraire’s particular capabilities, he remained quiet and made no attempt to insinuate himself into the 
conversations, rather listening for the purpose of educating himself. 
The conversation did turn, from time to time, to the more general subject of the war; out of the way as 
they were, their information was several weeks out of date, and speculation irresistible. Laurence joined 
them one evening to find Sutton saying, “The French fleet could be bloody well anywhere.” Sutton was 
Messoria’s captain and the senior among them, a veteran of four wars, and somewhat given to both 
pessimism and colorful language. “Now they have slipped out of Toulon, for all we know the bastards 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (120 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
are already on their way across the Channel; I wouldn’t be surprised to find the army of invasion on our 
doorstep tomorrow.” 
Laurence could hardly let this pass. “You are mistaken, I assure you,” he said, taking his seat. 
“Villeneuve and his fleet have slipped out of Toulon, yes, but he is not engaged in any grand operation, 
only in flight: Nelson has been in steady pursuit all along.” 
“Why, have you heard something, Laurence?” Chenery, Dulcia’s captain, asked, looking up from the 
desultory game of vingt-et-un that he and Little, Immortalis’s captain, were playing. 
“I have had some letters, yes; one from Captain Riley, of the Reliant,” Laurence said. “He is with 
Nelson’s fleet: they have chased Villeneuve across the Atlantic, and he writes that Lord Nelson has 
hopes of catching the French in the West Indies.” 
“Oh, and here we are without any idea of what is going on!” Chenery said. “For Heaven’s sake, fetch it 
here and read it to us; you are not very good to be keeping this all to yourself while we are all in the 
dark.” 
He spoke with too much eagerness for Laurence to take offense; as the sentiments were repeated by the 
other captains, he sent a servant to his room to bring him the scant handful of letters he had received 
from former colleagues who knew his new direction. He was obliged to omit several passages 
commiserating with him on his change in situation, but he managed to elide them gracefully enough, and 
the others listened with great hunger to his bits and pieces of news. 
“So Villeneuve has seventeen ships, to Nelson’s twelve?” Sutton said. “I don’t think much of the 
blighter for running, then. What if he turns about? Racing across the Atlantic like this, Nelson cannot 
have any aerial force; no transport could keep up the pace, and we do not have any dragons stationed in 
the West Indies.” 
“I dare say the fleet could take him with fewer ships still,” Laurence said, with spirit. “You are to 
remember the Nile, sir, and before that the battle of Cape St. Vincent: we have often been at some 
numerical disadvantage and still carried the day; and Lord Nelson himself has never lost a fleet action.” 
With some difficulty, he restrained himself and stopped here; he did not wish to seem an enthusiast. 
The others smiled, but not in any patronizing manner, and Little said in his quiet way, “We must hope he 
can bring them to account, then. The sad fact of the matter is, while the French fleet remains in any way 
intact, we are in deadly danger. The Navy cannot always be catching them, and Napoleon only need 
hold the Channel for two days, perhaps three, to ferry his army across.” 
This was a lowering thought, and they all felt its weight. Berkley at last broke the resulting silence with 
a grunt and took up his glass to drain it. “You can all sit about glooming; I am for bed,” he said. “We 
have enough to do without borrowing trouble.” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (121 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“And I must be up early,” Harcourt said, sitting up. “Celeritas wants Lily to practice spraying upon 
targets in the morning, before maneuvers.” 
“Yes, we all ought to get to sleep,” Sutton said. “We can hardly do better than to get this formation into 
order, in any case; if any chance of flattening Bonaparte’s fleet offers, you may be sure that one of the 
Longwing formations will be wanted, either ours or one of the two at Dover.” 
The party broke up, and Laurence climbed to his tower room thoughtfully. A Longwing could spit with 
tremendous accuracy; in their first day of training Laurence had seen Lily destroy targets with a single 
quick spurt from nearly four hundred feet in the air, and no cannon from the ground could ever fire so 
far straight up. Pepper guns might hamper her, but her only real danger would come from aloft: she 
would be the target of every enemy dragon in the air, and the formation as a whole was designed to 
protect her. The group would be a formidable presence upon any battlefield, Laurence could easily see; 
he would not have liked to be beneath them in a ship, and the prospect of doing so much good for 
England gave him fresh interest for the work. 
Unfortunately, as the weeks wore on, he saw plainly that Temeraire found it harder going to keep up his 
own interest. The first requirement of formation flying was precision, and holding one’s position relative 
to the others. Now that Temeraire was flying with the group, he was limited by the others, and with 
speed and maneuverability so far beyond the general, he soon began to feel the constraint. One 
afternoon, Laurence overheard him asking, “Do you ever do more interesting flying?” to Messoria; she 
was an experienced older dragon of thirty years, with a great many battle-scars to render her an object of 
admiration. 
She snorted indulgently at him. “Interesting is not very good; it is hard to remember interesting in the 
middle of a battle,” she said. “You will get used to it, never fear.” 
Temeraire sighed and went back to work without anything more like a complaint; but though he never 
failed to answer a request or to put forth an effort, he was not enthusiastic, and Laurence could not help 
worrying. He did his best to console Temeraire and provide him with other subjects to engage his 
interest; they continued their practice of reading together, and Temeraire listened with great interest to 
every mathematical or scientific article that Laurence could find. He followed them all without 
difficulty, and Laurence found himself in the strange position of having Temeraire explain to him the 
material which he was reading aloud. 
Even more usefully, perhaps a week after they had resumed training a parcel arrived for them in the mail 
from Sir Edward Howe. It was addressed somewhat whimsically to Temeraire, who was delighted to 
receive a piece of mail of his very own; Laurence unwrapped it for him and found within a fine volume 
of dragon stories from the Orient, translated by Sir Edward himself, and just published. 
Temeraire dictated a very graceful note of thanks, to which Laurence added his own, and the Oriental

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
tales became the set conclusion to their days: whatever other reading they did, they would finish with 
one of the stories. Even after they had read them all, Temeraire was perfectly happy to begin over again, 
or occasionally request a particular favorite, such as the story of the Yellow Emperor of China, the first 
Celestial dragon, on whose advice the Han dynasty had been founded; or the Japanese dragon Raiden, 
who had driven the armada of Kublai Khan away from the island nation. He particularly liked the last 
because of the parallel with Britain, menaced by Napoleon’s Grande Armée across the Channel. 
He listened also with a wistful air to the story of Xiao Sheng, the emperor’s minister, who swallowed a 
pearl from a dragon’s treasury and became a dragon himself; Laurence did not understand his attitude, 
until Temeraire said, “I do not suppose that is real? There is no way that people can become dragons, or 
the reverse?” 
“No, I am afraid not,” Laurence said slowly; the notion that Temeraire might have liked to make a 
change was distressing to him, suggesting as it did a very deep unhappiness. 
But Temeraire only sighed and said, “Oh, well; I thought as much. It would have been nice, though, to 
be able to read and write for myself when I liked, and also then you could fly alongside me.” 
Laurence laughed, reassured. “I am sorry indeed we cannot have such a pleasure; but even if it were 
possible, it does not sound a very comfortable process from the story, nor one which could be reversed.” 
“No, and I would not like to give up flying at all, not even for reading,” Temeraire said. “Besides, it is 
very pleasant to have you read to me; may we have another one? Perhaps the story about the dragon who 
made it rain, during the drought, by carrying water from the ocean?” 
The stories were obviously myths, but Sir Edward’s translation included a great many annotations, 
describing the realistic basis for the legends according to the best modern knowledge. Laurence 
suspected even these might be exaggerated slightly; Sir Edward was very clearly enthusiastic towards 
Oriental dragons. But they served their purpose admirably: the fantastic stories made Temeraire only 
more determined to prove his similar merit, and gave him better heart for the training. 
The book also proved useful for another reason, for only a little while after its arrival, Temeraire’s 
appearance diverged yet again from the other dragons, as he began to sprout thin tendrils round his jaws, 
and a ruff of delicate webbing stretched between flexible horns around his face, almost like a frill. It 
gave him a dramatic, serious look, not at all unbecoming, but there was no denying he looked very 
different from the others, and if it had not been for the lovely frontispiece of Sir Edward’s book, an 
engraving of the Yellow Emperor which showed that great dragon in possession of the same sort of ruff, 
Temeraire would certainly have been unhappy at being yet again marked apart from his fellows. 
He was still anxious at the change in his looks, and shortly after the ruff had come in, Laurence found 
him studying his reflection in the surface of the lake, turning his head this way and that and rolling his 
eyes back in his head to see himself and the ruff from different angles.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Come now, you are like to make everyone think you are a vain creature,” Laurence said, reaching up to 
pet the waving tendrils. “Truly, they look very well; pray give them no thought.” 
Temeraire made a small, startled noise, and leaned in towards the stroking. “That feels strange,” he said. 
“Am I hurting you? Are they so tender?” Laurence stopped at once, anxious. Though he had not said as 
much to Temeraire, he had noticed from reading the stories that the Chinese dragons, at least the 
Imperials and Celestials, did not seem to do a great deal of fighting, except in moments of the greatest 
crisis for their nations. They seemed more famed for beauty and wisdom, and if the Chinese bred for 
such qualities first, it would not be impossible that the tendrils might be of a sensitivity which could 
make them a point of vulnerability in battle. 
Temeraire nudged him a little and said, “No, they do not hurt at all. Pray do it again?” When Laurence 
very carefully resumed the stroking, Temeraire made an odd purring sort of sound, and abruptly shivered 
all over. “I think I quite like it,” he added, his eyes growing unfocused and heavy-lidded. 
Laurence snatched his hand away. “Oh, Lord,” he said, glancing around in deep embarrassment; 
thankfully no other dragons or aviators were about at the moment. “I had better speak to Celeritas at 
once; I think you are coming into season for the first time. I ought to have realized, when they sprouted; 
it must mean you have reached your full growth.” 
Temeraire blinked. “Oh, very well; but must you stop?” he asked plaintively. 
  
“It is excellent news,” Celeritas said, when Laurence had conveyed this intelligence. “We cannot breed 
him yet, for he cannot be spared for so long, but I am very pleased regardless: I am always anxious when 
sending an immature dragon into battle. And I will send word to the breeders; they will think of the best 
potential crosses to make. The addition of Imperial blood to our lines can only be of the greatest 
benefit.” 
“Is there anything—some means of relief—” Laurence stopped, not quite sure how to word the question 
in a way which would not seem outrageous. 
“We will have to see, but I think you need not worry,” Celeritas said dryly. “We are not like horses or 
dogs; we can control ourselves at least as well as you humans.” 
Laurence was relieved; he had feared that Temeraire might find it difficult now to be in close company 
with Lily or Messoria, or the other female dragons, though he rather thought Dulcia was too small to be 
a partner of interest to him. But he expressed no interest of that sort in them; Laurence ventured to ask 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (124 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
him, once or twice, in a hinting way, and Temeraire seemed mostly baffled at the notion. 
Nevertheless there were some changes, which became perceptible by degrees. Laurence first noticed that 
Temeraire was more often awake in the mornings without having to be roused; his appetites changed 
also, and he ate less frequently, though in greater quantities, and might voluntarily go so long as two 
days without eating at all. 
Laurence was somewhat concerned that Temeraire was starving himself to avoid the unpleasantness of 
not being given precedence, or the sideways looks of the other dragons at his new appearance. However, 
his fears were relieved in dramatic fashion, scarcely a month after the ruff had developed. He had just 
landed Temeraire at the feeding grounds and stood off from the mass of assembled dragons to observe, 
when Lily and Maximus were called onto the grounds. But on this occasion, another dragon was called 
down with them: a newcomer of a breed Laurence had never before seen, its wings patterned like 
marble, veins of orange and yellow and brown shot through a nearly translucent ivory, and very large, 
but not bigger than Temeraire. 
The other dragons of the covert gave way and watched them go down, but Temeraire unexpectedly made 
a low rumbling noise, not quite a growl, from deep in his throat; very like a croaking bullfrog if a frog of 
some twelve tons might be imagined, and he leapt down after them uninvited. 
Laurence could not see the faces of the herders, so far below, but they milled about the fences as if taken 
aback; it was quite clear however that none of them liked to try and shoo Temeraire away, not surprising 
considering that he was already up to his chops in the gore of his first cow. Lily and Maximus made no 
objection, the strange dragon of course did not even notice it as a change, and after a moment the herders 
released half a dozen more beasts into the grounds, that all four dragons might eat their fill. 
“He is of a splendid conformity; he is yours, is he not?” Laurence turned to find himself addressed by a 
stranger, wearing thick woolen trousers and a plain civilian’s coat, both marked with dragon-scale 
impressions: he was certainly an aviator and an officer besides, his carriage and voice gentleman-like, 
but he spoke with a heavy French accent, and Laurence was puzzled momentarily by his presence. 
The Frenchman was not alone; Sutton was keeping him company, and now he stepped forward to make 
the introductions: the Frenchman’s name was Choiseul. 
“I have come from Austria only last night, with Praecursoris,” Choiseul said, gesturing at the marbled 
dragon below, who was daintily taking another sheep, neatly avoiding the blood spurting from 
Maximus’s third victim. 
“He has some good news for us, though he makes a long face over it,” Sutton said. “Austria is 
mobilizing; she is coming into the war with Bonaparte again, and I dare say he will have to turn his 
attention to the Rhine instead of the Channel, soon enough.” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (125 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Choiseul said, “I hope I do not discourage your hopes in any way; I would be desolate to give you 
unnecessary concern. But I cannot say that I have great confidence in their chances. I do not wish to 
sound ungrateful; the Austrian corps was generous enough to grant myself and Praecursoris asylum 
during the Revolution, and I am most deeply in their debt. But the archdukes are fools, and they will not 
listen to the few generals of competence they have. Archduke Ferdinand to fight the genius of Marengo 
and Egypt! It is an absurdity.” 
“I cannot say that Marengo was so brilliantly run as all that,” Sutton said. “If the Austrians had only 
brought up their second aerial division from Verona in time, we would have had a very different ending; 
it was as much luck as anything.” 
Laurence did not feel himself sufficiently in command of land tactics to offer his own comment, but this 
seemed perilously close to bravado; in any case, he had a healthy respect for luck, and Bonaparte 
seemed to attract a greater share than most generals. 
For his part, Choiseul smiled briefly and did not contradict, saying only, “Perhaps my fears are 
excessive; still, they have brought us here, for our position in a defeated Austria would be untenable. 
There are many men in my former service who are very savage against me for having taken so valuable 
a dragon as Praecursoris away,” he explained, in answer to Laurence’s look of inquiry. “Friends warned 
me that Bonaparte means to demand our surrender as part of any terms that might be made, and to place 
us under a charge of treason. So again we have had to flee, and now we cast ourselves upon your 
generosity.” 
He spoke with an easy, pleasant manner, but there were deep lines around his eyes, and they were 
unhappy; Laurence looked at him with sympathy. He had known French officers of his sort before, naval 
men who had fled France after the Revolution, eating their hearts out on England’s shores; their position 
was a sad and bitter one: worse, he felt, than the merely dispossessed noblemen who had fled to save 
their lives, for they felt all the pain of sitting idle while their nation was at war, and every victory 
celebrated in England was a wrenching loss for their own service. 
“Oh yes, it is uncommon generous of us, taking in a Chanson-de-Guerre like this,” Sutton said, with 
heavy but well-meant raillery. “After all, we have so very many heavyweights we can hardly squeeze in 
another, particularly so fine and well-trained a veteran.” 
Choiseul bowed slightly in acknowledgment and looked down at his dragon with affection. “I gladly 
accept the compliment for Praecursoris, but you have already many fine beasts here; that Regal Copper 
looks prodigious, and I see from his horns he is not yet at his full growth. And your dragon, Captain 
Laurence, surely he is some new breed? I have not seen his like.” 
“No, nor are you likely to again,” Sutton said, “unless you go halfway round the world.” 
“He is an Imperial, sir, a Chinese breed,” Laurence said, torn between not wishing to show off and an 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (126 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
undeniable pleasure in doing just so. Choiseul’s astonished reaction, though decently restrained, was 
highly satisfying, but then Laurence was obliged to explain the circumstances of Temeraire’s 
acquisition, and he could not help but feel somewhat awkward when relating the triumphant capture of a 
French ship and a French egg to a Frenchman. 
But Choiseul was clearly used to the situation and heard the story with at least the appearance of 
complaisance, though he offered no remark. Though Sutton was inclined to dwell on the French loss a 
little smugly, Laurence hurried on to ask what Choiseul would be doing in the covert. 
“I understand there is a formation in training, and that Praecursoris and I are to join in the maneuvers: 
some notion I believe of our serving as a relief, when circumstances allow,” Choiseul said. “Celeritas 
hopes also that Praecursoris may be of some assistance in the training of your heaviest beasts for 
formation flying: we have always flown in formation, for close on fourteen years now.” 
A thundering rush of wings interrupted their conversation as the other dragons were called to the hunting 
grounds, the first four having finished their meal, and Temeraire and Praecursoris both made an attempt 
to land at the same convenient outcropping nearby: Laurence was startled to see Temeraire bare his teeth 
and flare his ruff at the older dragon. “I beg you to excuse me,” he said hastily, and hurried to find 
another place, calling Temeraire, and with relief saw him wheel away and follow. 
“I would have come to you,” Temeraire said, a little reproachfully, casting a narrowed eye at 
Praecursoris, who was now occupying the contested perch and speaking quietly with Choiseul. 
“They are guests here; it is only courteous to give way,” Laurence said. “I had no notion that you were 
so fierce in matters of precedence, my dear.” 
Temeraire furrowed the ground before him with his claws. “He is not any bigger than I am,” he said. 
“And he is not a Longwing, so he does not spit poison, and there are no fire-breathing dragons in 
Britain; I do not see why he is any better than I am.” 
“He is not one jot better, not at all,” Laurence said, stroking the tensed foreleg. “Precedence is merely a 
matter of formality, and you are perfectly within your rights to eat with the others. Pray do not be 
quarrelsome, however; they have fled the Continent, to be away from Bonaparte.” 
“Oh?” Temeraire’s ruff smoothed out gradually against his neck, and he looked at the strange dragon 
with more interest. “But they are speaking French; if they are French, why are they afraid of 
Bonaparte?” 
“They are royalists, loyal to the Bourbon kings,” Laurence said. “I dare say they left after the Jacobins 
put the King to death; it was very dreadful in France for a while, I am afraid, and though Bonaparte is at 
least not chopping people’s heads off anymore, he is scarcely much better in their eyes; I assure you they 
despise him worse than we do.”

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Well, I am sorry if I was rude,” Temeraire murmured, and straightened up to address Praecursoris. 
“Veuillez m’excuser, si je vous ai dérangé,” he said, to Laurence’s astonishment. 
Praecursoris turned around. “Mais non, pas du tout,” he answered mildly, and inclined his head. 
“Permettez que je vous présente Choiseul, mon capitaine,” he added. 
“Et voici Laurence, le mien,” Temeraire said. “Laurence, pray bow,” he added, in an undertone, when 
Laurence only stood staring. 
Laurence at once made his leg; he of course could not interrupt the formal exchange, but he was bursting 
with curiosity, and as soon as they were winging their way down to the lake for Temeraire’s bath, he 
demanded, “But how on earth do you come to speak French?” 
Temeraire turned his head about. “What do you mean? Is it very unusual to speak French? It was not at 
all difficult.” 
“Well, it is prodigious strange; so far as I know you have never heard a word of it: certainly not from 
me, for I am lucky if I can say my bonjours without embarrassing myself,” Laurence said. 
“I am not surprised that he can speak French,” Celeritas said, when Laurence asked him later that 
afternoon, at the training grounds, “but only that you should not have heard him do so before; do you 
mean to say Temeraire did not speak French when he first cracked the shell? He spoke English 
directly?” 
“Why, yes,” Laurence said. “I confess we were surprised, but only to hear him speak at all so soon. Is it 
unusual?” 
“That he spoke, no; we learn language through the shell,” Celeritas said. “And as he was aboard a 
French vessel in the months before his hatching, I am not surprised at all that he should know that 
tongue. I am far more surprised that he was able to speak English after only a week aboard. Fluently?” 
“From the first moment,” Laurence said, pleased at this fresh evidence of Temeraire’s unique gifts. 
“You have been forever surprising me, my dear,” he added, patting Temeraire’s neck, making him preen 
with satisfaction. 
But Temeraire continued somewhat more prickly, particularly where Praecursoris was concerned: no 
open animosity, nor any particular hostility, but he was clearly anxious to show himself an equal to the 
older dragon, particularly once Celeritas began to include the Chanson-de-Guerre in their maneuvers. 
Praecursoris was not, Laurence was secretly glad to see, as fluid or graceful in the air as Temeraire; but 
his experience and that of his captain counted for a great deal, and they knew and had mastered many of 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (128 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
the formation maneuvers already. Temeraire grew very intent on his work; Laurence sometimes came 
out from dinner and found his dragon flying alone over the lake, practicing the maneuvers he had once 
found so boring, and on more than one occasion he even asked to sacrifice part of their reading time to 
additional work. He would have worked himself to exhaustion daily if Laurence had not restrained him. 
At last Laurence went to Celeritas to ask his advice, hoping to learn some way of easing Temeraire’s 
intensity, or perhaps persuading Celeritas to separate the two dragons. But the training master listened to 
his objections and said calmly, “Captain Laurence, you are thinking of your dragon’s happiness. That is 
as it should be, but I must think first of his training, and the needs of the Corps. Do you argue he is not 
progressing quickly, and to great levels of skill, since Praecursoris arrived?” 
Laurence could only stare; the idea that Celeritas had deliberately promoted the rivalry to encourage 
Temeraire was first startling, then almost offensive. “Sir, Temeraire has always been willing, has always 
put forth his best efforts,” he began angrily, and only stopped when Celeritas snorted to interrupt him. 
“Pull up, Captain,” he said, with a rough amusement. “I am not insulting him. The truth is, he is a little 
too intelligent to be an ideal formation fighter. If the situation were different, we would make him a 
formation leader or an independent, and he would do very well. But as matters stand, given his weight, 
we must have him in formation, and that means he must learn rote maneuvers. They are simply not 
enough to hold his attention. It is not a very common complaint, but I have seen it before, and the signs 
are unmistakable.” 
Laurence unhappily could offer no argument; there was perfect truth in Celeritas’s remarks. Seeing that 
Laurence had fallen silent, the training master continued, “This rivalry adds enough spice to overcome a 
natural boredom which would shortly progress to frustration. Encourage him, praise him, keep him 
confident in your affection, and he will not suffer from a bit of squabbling with another male; it is very 
natural, at his age, and better he should set himself against Praecursoris than Maximus; Praecursoris is 
old enough not to take it seriously.” 
Laurence could not be so sanguine; Celeritas did not see how Temeraire fretted. Yet neither could 
Laurence deny that his remarks were motivated from a selfish perspective: he disliked seeing Temeraire 
driving himself so hard. But of course he needed to be driven hard; they all did. 
Here in the placid green north, it was too easy to forget that Britain was in great danger. Villeneuve and 
the French navy were still on the loose; according to dispatches, Nelson had chased them all the way to 
the West Indies only to be eluded again, and now was desperately seeking them in the Atlantic. 
Villeneuve’s intention was certainly to meet with the fleet out of Brest and then attempt to seize the 
straits of Dover; Bonaparte had a vast number of transports cramming every port along the French coast, 
waiting only for such a break in the Channel defenses to ferry over the massive army of invasion. 
Laurence had served on blockade-duty for many long months, and he knew well how difficult it was to 
maintain discipline through the endless, unvarying days with no enemy in sight. The distractions of more 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (129 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
company, a wider landscape, books, games: these things made the duty of training more pleasant by far, 
but he now recognized that in their own way they were as insidious as monotony. 
So he only bowed, and said, “I understand your design, sir; thank you for the explanation.” But he 
returned to Temeraire still determined to curb the almost obsessive practicing, and if possible to find an 
alternative means of engaging the dragon’s interest in the maneuvers. 
These were the circumstances which first gave him the notion of explaining formation tactics to 
Temeraire. He did so more for Temeraire’s sake than his own, hoping to give the dragon some more 
intellectual interest in the maneuvers. But Temeraire followed the subject with ease, and shortly the 
lessons became real discussion, as valuable to Laurence as to Temeraire, and more than compensating 
for his lack of participation in the debates which the captains held among themselves. 
Together they embarked on designing a series of their own maneuvers, taking advantage of Temeraire’s 
unusual flying capabilities, which could be fitted into the slower and more methodical pace of the 
formation. Celeritas himself had spoken of designing such maneuvers, but the pressing need for the 
formation had forced him to put aside the plan for the immediate future. 
Laurence salvaged an old flight-table from the attics, recruited Hollin’s help to repair its broken leg, and 
set it up in Temeraire’s clearing under his dragon’s interested eyes. It was a sort of vast diorama set 
upon a table, with a latticework on top; Laurence did not have a set of the proper scale figures of 
dragons to hang from it, but he substituted whittled and colored bits of wood, and by tying these with 
bits of thread from the lattice, they were able to display three-dimensional positions for each other’s 
consideration. 
Temeraire from the beginning displayed an intuitive grasp of aerial movement. He could instantly 
declare whether a maneuver was feasible or not, and describe the movements necessary to bring it about 
if so; the initial inspiration for a new maneuver was most often his. Laurence in turn could better assess 
the relative military strengths of various positions, and suggest such modifications as would improve the 
force which might be brought to bear. 
Their discussions were lively and vocal, and attracted the attention of the rest of his crew; Granby 
tentatively asked to observe, and when Laurence gave leave, was shortly followed by the second 
lieutenant, Evans, and many of the midwingmen. Their years of training and experience gave them a 
foundation of knowledge which both Laurence and Temeraire lacked, and their suggestions further 
refined the design. 
“Sir, the others have asked me to propose to you that perhaps we might try some of the new maneuvers,” 
Granby said to him, some few weeks into the project. “We would be more than happy to sacrifice our 
evenings to the work; it would be infamous not to have a chance of showing what he can do.” 
Laurence was deeply moved, not merely by their enthusiasm, but by seeing that Granby and the crew 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (130 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
felt the same desire to see Temeraire acknowledged and approved. He was very glad indeed to find the 
others as proud of and for Temeraire as he himself was. “If we have enough hands present tomorrow 
evening, perhaps we may,” Laurence said. 
Every officer from his three runners on up was present ten minutes early. Laurence looked over them a 
little bemused as he and Temeraire descended from their daily trip to the lake; he only now realized, 
with all of them lined up and waiting, that his aerial crew wore their full uniforms, even now in this 
impromptu session. The other crews were often to be seen without coats or neckcloths, particularly in 
the recent heat; he could not help but take this as a compliment to his own habit. 
Mr. Hollin and the ground crew were also ready and waiting; even though Temeraire was inclined to 
fidget in his excitement, they swiftly had him in his combat-duty harness, and the aerial crew came 
swarming aboard. 
“All aboard and latched on, sir,” Granby said, taking up his own launch position on Temeraire’s right 
shoulder. 
“Very well. Temeraire, we will begin with the standard clear-weather patrol pattern twice, then shift to 
the modified version on my signal,” Laurence said. 
Temeraire nodded, his eyes bright, and launched himself into the air. It was the simplest of their new 
maneuvers, and Temeraire had little difficulty following it; the greater problem, Laurence saw at once, 
as Temeraire pulled out of the last corkscrewing turn and back into his standard position, would be in 
accustoming the crew. The riflemen had missed at least half their targets, and Temeraire’s sides were 
stained where the lightly weighted sacks full of ash that stood for bombs in practice had hit him instead 
of falling below. 
“Well, Mr. Granby, we have some work ahead of us before we can make a creditable showing of it,” 
Laurence said, and Granby nodded ruefully. 
“Indeed, sir; perhaps if he flew a little slower at first?” Granby said. 
“I think perhaps we must adjust our thinking as well,” Laurence said, studying the pattern of ash marks. 
“We cannot be hurling bombs during these quick turns he makes, there is no way we can be sure of 
missing him. So we cannot work steadily: we must wait and release the equivalent of a full broadside in 
the moments when he is level. We will be at greater risk of missing a target entirely, but that risk can be 
borne; the other cannot.” 
Temeraire flew in an easy circuit while the topmen and bellmen hastily adjusted their bombing gear; this 
time, when they attempted the maneuver again, Laurence saw the sacks falling away, and there were no 
fresh marks to be seen on Temeraire’s sides. The riflemen, also waiting for the level parts of the run, 
improved their record as well, and after half a dozen repetitions, Laurence was well-satisfied with the 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (131 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
results. 
“When we can deliver our full allotment of bombs and achieve perhaps an eighty percent success rate in 
our gunnery, on this and the other four new maneuvers, I will consider our work worth bringing to 
Celeritas’s attention,” Laurence said, when they had all dismounted and the ground crew were stripping 
Temeraire and polishing the dust and grime off his hide. “And I think it eminently achievable: I 
commend all of you, gentlemen, on a most creditable performance.” 
Laurence had previously been sparing with his praise, not wishing to seem as though he was courting the 
crew’s affections, but now he felt he could scarcely be overly enthusiastic, and he was pleased to see the 
heartfelt response of his officers to the approval. They were uniformly eager to continue, and after 
another four weeks of practice, Laurence was indeed beginning to think them ready to perform for a 
wider audience when the decision was taken from his hands. 
“That was an interesting variation you were flying last evening, Captain,” Celeritas said to him at the 
end of the morning session, as the dragons of the formation landed and the crews disembarked. “Let us 
see you fly it tomorrow in formation.” With that he nodded and dismissed them, and Laurence was left 
to call together his crew and Temeraire for a hasty final practice. 
Temeraire was inclined to be anxious, late that evening, after the others had gone back inside and he and 
Laurence were sitting quietly together in the dark, too tired to do more than rest in each other’s 
company. 
“Come, do not let yourself fret,” Laurence said. “You will do very well tomorrow; you have mastered all 
of the maneuvers from beginning to end. We have been holding back only to give the crew better 
mastery.” 
“I am not very worried about the flying, but what if Celeritas does not approve of the maneuvers?” 
Temeraire said. “We would have wasted all our time to no purpose.” 
“If he thought the maneuvers wholly unwise, he would never have solicited us,” Laurence said. “And in 
any case our time has not been wasted in the least; the crew have all learned their work a good deal 
better for having to give more attention and thought to their tasks, and even if Celeritas disapproved 
entirely I would still count all these evenings of ours profitably spent.” 
He at last soothed Temeraire to sleep and himself dozed off by the dragon’s side; though it was early 
September, the summer’s warmth was lingering, and he took no chill. Despite all his reassurances to 
Temeraire, Laurence himself was up and alert by first light, and he could not wholly repress a degree of 
anxiety in his own breast. Most of his crew were at the breakfast table as early as he was, so he made a 
point of speaking with several of them, and eating heartily; he would rather have not taken anything but 
coffee.

When he came out into the training courtyard he found Temeraire there already in his gear and looking 
over the valley; his tail was lashing the air uneasily. Celeritas was not yet there; fifteen minutes passed 
before any of the other dragons of the formation arrived, and by then Laurence had taken Temeraire and 
his crew out to fly a few circuits of the area. The younger ensigns and midwingmen were particularly 
inclined to be shrill, and he had the hands go through exchanging places to settle their nerves. 
Dulcia landed, and Maximus after her; the full formation was now assembled, and Laurence brought 
Temeraire back in to the courtyard. Celeritas had still not yet arrived. Lily was yawning widely; 
Praecursoris was quietly speaking with Nitidus, the Pascal’s Blue, who also spoke French, his egg 
having been purchased from a French hatchery many years before the start of the war, when relations 
had been amicable enough to permit such exchanges. Temeraire still looked at Praecursoris with a 
brooding eye, but for once Laurence did not mind, if it would provide some distraction. 
A bright flurry of wings caught his eye; looking up, he saw Celeritas coming in to land, and beyond him 
the rapidly dwindling forms of several Winchesters and Greylings, going away in various directions. 
Lower in the sky, two Yellow Reapers were heading south in company with Victoriatus, though the 
wounded Parnassian’s convalescence was not properly over. All the dragons came alert, sitting up; the 
captains’ voices died away; the crews fell into a heavy and expectant silence, all before Celeritas even 
reached the ground. 
“Villeneuve and his fleet have been caught,” Celeritas said, raising his voice to be heard over the noise. 
“They have been penned up in the port of Cadiz, with the Spanish navy also.” Even as he spoke, the 
servants were running out of the hall, carrying hastily packed bags and boxes; even the maids and cooks 
had been pressed into duty. Without being ordered, Temeraire rose to all four legs, just as did the other 
dragons; the ground crews were already unrolling the belly-netting and climbing up to rig the tents. 
“Mortiferus has been sent to Cadiz; Lily’s formation must go to the Channel at once to take the place of 
his wing. Captain Harcourt,” Celeritas said, turning to her, “Excidium remains at the Channel, and he 
has eighty years’ experience; you and Lily must train with him in every free moment you have. I am 
giving Captain Sutton command of the formation for the moment; this is no reflection upon your work, 
but with this abbreviation of your training, we must have more experience in the role.” 
It was more usual for the captain of the lead dragon of a formation to be the commander, largely because 
that dragon had to lead off every maneuver, but she nodded without any sign of offense. “Yes, 
certainly,” she said; her voice came out a little high, and Laurence glanced at her with quick sympathy: 
Lily had hatched unexpectedly early, and Harcourt had become a captain barely out of her own training; 
this might well be her first action, or very nearly so. 
Celeritas gave her an approving nod. “Captain Sutton, you will naturally consult with Captain Harcourt 
as far as possible.” 
“Of course,” Sutton said, bowing to Harcourt from his position aboard Messoria’s back.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
The baggage was already pulled down tight, and Celeritas took a moment to inspect each of the 
harnesses in turn. “Very good: try your loads. Maximus, begin.” 
One by one, the dragons all rose to their hind legs, wind tearing across the courtyard as they beat their 
wings and tried to shake the rigging loose; one by one they dropped and reported, “All lies well.” 
“Ground crews aboard,” Celeritas said, and Laurence watched while Hollin and his men hurried into the 
belly-rigging and strapped themselves in for the long flight. The signal came up from below, indicating 
they were ready, and he nodded to his signal-ensign, Turner, who raised the green flag. Maximus’s and 
Praecursoris’s crews raised their flags only a moment later; the smaller dragons were already waiting. 
Celeritas sat back onto his haunches, surveying them all. “Fly well,” he said simply. 
There was nothing more, no other ceremony or preparation; Captain Sutton’s signal-ensign raised the 
flag for formation go aloft, and Temeraire sprang into the air with the others, falling into position beside 
Maximus. The wind was in the north-west, almost directly behind them, and as they rose through the 
cloud cover, far to the east Laurence could see the faint glimmer of sunlight on water. 
  
  
Chapter 9 
 
THE RIFLE-BALL PASSED so close it stirred Laurence’s hair; the crack of return fire sounded behind 
him, and Temeraire slashed out at the French dragon as they swept past, raking the deep blue hide with 
long gashes even as he twisted gracefully to avoid the other dragon’s talons. 
“It’s a Fleur-de-Nuit, sir, the coloring,” Granby shouted, wind whipping away at his hair, as the blue 
dragon pulled away with a bellow and wheeled about for another attempt at the formation, its crew 
already clambering down to stanch the bleeding: the wounds were not disabling. 
Laurence nodded. “Yes. Mr. Martin,” he called, more loudly, “get the flash-powder ready; we will give 
them a show on their next pass.” The French breed were heavily built and dangerous, but they were 
nocturnal by nature, and their eyes sensitive to sudden flashes of bright light. “Mr. Turner, the flash-
powder warning signal, if you please.”

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
A quick confirmation came from Messoria’s signal-ensign; the Yellow Reaper was herself engaged in 
fending off a spirited attack against the front of the formation by a French middleweight. Laurence 
reached out to pat Temeraire’s neck, catching his attention. “We are going to give the Fleur-de-Nuit a 
dose of flash-powder,” he shouted. “Hold this position, and wait for the signal.” 
“Yes, I am ready,” Temeraire said, a deep note of excitement ringing in his voice; he was almost 
trembling. 
“Pray be careful,” Laurence could not help adding; the French dragon was an older one, judging by its 
scars, and he did not want Temeraire to be hurt through overconfidence. 
The Fleur-de-Nuit arrowed towards them, trying once again to barrel between Temeraire and Nitidus: 
the goal was clearly to split apart the formation, injuring one or the other dragon in the process, which 
would leave Lily vulnerable to attack from behind on a subsequent pass. Sutton was already signaling a 
new maneuver which would bring them about and give Lily an angle of attack against the Fleur-de-Nuit, 
which was the largest of the French assailants, but before it could be accomplished this next run had to 
be deflected. 
“All hands at the ready; stand by on the powder,” Laurence said, using the speaking-trumpet to amplify 
his orders, as the massive blue-and-black creature came roaring towards them. The speed of the 
engagement was far beyond anything Laurence had ever before experienced. In the Navy, an exchange 
of fire might last five minutes; here a pass was over in less than one, and then a second came almost 
immediately. This time the French dragon was angling closer towards Nitidus, wanting nothing more to 
do with Temeraire’s claws; the smaller Pascal’s Blue would not be able to hold his position against the 
great bulk. “Hard to larboard; close with him!” he shouted to Temeraire. 
Temeraire answered at once; his great black wings abruptly swiveled and tilted them towards the Fleur-
de-Nuit, and Temeraire closed more swiftly than a typical heavy-combat dragon would have been able 
to do. The enemy dragon jerked and looked at them in reflex, and Laurence shouted, “Light the 
powder,” as he caught a glimpse of the pale white eyes. 
He only just closed his own eyes in time; the brilliant flash was visible even through his eyelids, and the 
Fleur-de-Nuit bellowed in pain. Laurence opened his eyes again to find Temeraire slashing fiercely at 
the other dragon, carving deep strokes into its belly, and his riflemen strafing the bellmen on the other 
side. “Temeraire, hold your position,” Laurence called; Temeraire was in danger of falling behind in his 
enthusiasm for fighting off the other dragon. 
With a start, Temeraire beat his wings in a flurry and lunged back into his place in the formation; 
Sutton’s signal-ensign raised the green flag, and as a unit they all wheeled around in a tight loop, Lily 
already opening her jaws and hissing: the Fleur-de-Nuit was still flying blind, and streaming blood into 
the air as its crew tried to guide it away. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (135 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Enemy above! Enemy above!” Maximus’s larboard lookout was pointing frantically upwards; even as 
the boy shrilled, a terrible thick roaring like thunder sounded in their ears and drowned him out: a Grand 
Chevalier came plummeting down towards them. The dragon’s pale belly had allowed it to blend into 
the heavy cloud cover undetected by the lookouts, and now it descended towards Lily, great claws 
opening wide; it was nearly twice her size, and outweighed even Maximus. 
Laurence was shocked to see Messoria and Immortalis both suddenly drop; he realized belatedly it was 
the reflex which Celeritas had warned them of, so long ago: a reaction to being startled from above. 
Nitidus had given a startled jerk of his wings, but recovered, and Dulcia had kept her position, but 
Maximus had put on a burst of speed and overshot the others, and Lily herself was wheeling around in 
instinctive alarm. The formation had dissolved into chaos, and she was wholly exposed. 
“Ready all guns; straight at him!” he roared, signaling frantically to Temeraire; it was unnecessary, for 
after a moment’s hovering, Temeraire had already launched himself to Lily’s defense. The Chevalier 
was too close to deflect him entirely, but if they could strike him before he was able to latch on to Lily, 
they could still save her from a fatal mauling, and give her time to strike back. 
The four other French dragons were all coming about again. Temeraire put on a burst of sudden speed 
and just barely slid past the reaching claws of the Pêcheur-Couronné, and collided with the great French 
beast with all his claws outstretched even as the Chevalier slashed at Lily’s back. 
She shrieked in pain and fury, thrashing; the three dragons were all entangled now, beating their wings 
furiously in opposite directions, clawing and slashing. Lily could not spit upwards; they had to somehow 
get her loose, but Temeraire was much smaller than the Chevalier, and Laurence could see the enormous 
dragon’s claws sinking deeper into Lily’s flesh, even though her crew were hacking at the iron-hard 
talons with axes. 
“Get a bomb up here,” Laurence snapped to Granby; they would have to try and hurl one into the 
Chevalier’s belly-rigging, despite the danger of missing and striking Temeraire or Lily. 
Temeraire kept slashing away in a blind passion, his sides belling out for breath; he roared so 
tremendously that his body vibrated with the force and Laurence’s ears ached. The Chevalier shuddered 
with pain; somewhere on his other side, Maximus also roared, blocked from Laurence’s sight by the 
French dragon’s bulk. The attack had its effect: the Chevalier bellowed in his deep hoarse voice, and his 
claws sprang free. 
“Cut loose,” Laurence shouted. “Temeraire, cut loose; get between him and Lily.” In answer, Temeraire 
pulled himself free and dropped. Lily was moaning, streaming blood, and she was losing elevation 
rapidly. Having driven off the Chevalier was not enough: the other dragons were now as great a danger 
to her until she could get back aloft into fighting position. Laurence heard Captain Harcourt calling 
orders whose words he could not make out; abruptly Lily’s belly-rigging fell away like a great net 
sinking down through the clouds, and bombs, supplies, baggage, all went tumbling down and vanished 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (136 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
into the waters of the Channel below; her ground crew were all tying themselves to the main harness 
instead. 
Thus lightened, Lily shuddered and made a great effort, beating back up into the sky; the wounds were 
being packed with white bandages, but even at a distance Laurence could see she would need stitching. 
Maximus had the Chevalier engaged, but the Pêcheur-Couronné and the Fleur-de-Nuit were falling into 
a small wedge formation with the other French middle-weight, preparing to take a dash at Lily again. 
Temeraire maintained position just above Lily and hissed threateningly, his bloody claws flexing; but 
she was climbing too slowly. 
The battle had turned into a wild melee; though the other British dragons had now recovered from their 
initial fright, they were in no sort of order. Harcourt was wholly occupied with Lily’s difficulties, and 
the last French dragon, a Pêcheur-Rayé, was fighting Messoria far below. Clearly the French had 
identified Sutton as the commander, and were keeping him out of the way; a strategy Laurence could 
grimly admire. He had no authority to take command, he was the most junior captain in the party, but 
something had to be done. 
“Turner,” he said, catching his signal-ensign’s attention; but before he gave any order, the other British 
dragons were already wheeling around and in motion. 
“Signal, sir, form up around leader,” Turner said, pointing. 
Laurence looked back and saw Praecursoris swinging into Maximus’s usual place with signal-flags 
waving: not being limited to the formation’s pace, Choiseul and the big dragon had gone on ahead of 
them, but his lookouts had evidently caught sight of the battle and he had now returned. Laurence tapped 
Temeraire’s shoulder to draw his attention to the signal. “I see it,” Temeraire called back, and at once 
backwinged and settled into his proper position. 
Another signal flashed out, and Laurence brought Temeraire up and in closer; Nitidus also pulled in 
more tightly, and together they closed the gap in the formation where Messoria would normally have 
been. Formation rise together, the next signal came, and with the other dragons around her, Lily took 
heart and was able to beat up more strongly: the bleeding had stopped at last. The trio of French dragons 
had separated; they could no longer hope to succeed with a collective charge, not straight into Lily’s 
jaws, and the formation would be up to the level of the Chevalier in a moment. 
Maximus break away, the signal flashed: Maximus was still engaged in close quarters with the 
Chevalier, and rifles were cracking away on both sides. The great Regal Copper gave a final slash of his 
claws and pushed away: just a fraction too soon, for the formation was not yet high enough, and another 
few moments were necessary before Lily would be able to strike. 
The Chevalier’s crew now saw his fresh danger and sent the big dragon back aloft, a great deal of 
shouting going on aboard in French. Though he was bleeding from many wounds, the Chevalier was so 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (137 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
large that these did not hamper him severely, and he was still able to climb quicker than the injured Lily. 
After a moment, Choiseul signaled, Formation hold elevation, and they gave up the pursuit. 
The French dragons came together at a distance into a loose cluster, wheeling around as they considered 
their next attack. But then they all turned as one and fled rapidly north-east, the Pêcheur-Rayé 
disengaging from Messoria also. Temeraire’s lookouts were all calling out and pointing to the south, and 
when Laurence looked over his shoulder he saw ten dragons flying towards them at great speed, British 
signals flashing out from the Longwing in the lead. 
  
The Longwing was indeed Excidium; he and his formation accompanied them along the rest of the 
journey to the Dover covert, the two heavyweight Chequered Nettles among them taking it in turn to 
support Lily on the way. She was making reasonable progress, but her head was drooping, and she made 
a very heavy landing, her legs trembling so that the crew only barely managed to scramble off before she 
crumpled to the ground. Captain Harcourt’s face was streaked with unashamed tears, and she ran to 
Lily’s head and stood there caressing her and murmuring loving encouragement while the surgeons 
began their work. 
Laurence directed Temeraire to land on the very edge of the covert’s landing ground, so the injured 
dragons might have more room. Maximus, Immortalis, and Messoria had all taken painful if not 
dangerous wounds in the battle, though nothing like what Lily had suffered, and their low cries of pain 
were very difficult to hear. Laurence repressed a shudder and stroked Temeraire’s sleek neck; he was 
deeply grateful for Temeraire’s quickness and grace, which had preserved him from the others’ fate. 
“Mr. Granby, let us unload at once, and then if you please, let us see what we can spare for the comfort 
of Lily’s crew; they have no baggage left, it looks to me.” 
“Very good, sir,” Granby said, turning to give the orders at once. 
It took several hours to settle the dragons down and get them unpacked and fed; fortunately the covert 
was a very large one, covering perhaps one hundred acres when including the cattle pastures, and there 
was no difficulty about finding a comfortably large clearing for Temeraire. Temeraire was wavering 
between excitement at having seen his first battle and deep anxiety for Lily’s sake; for once he ate only 
indifferently, and Laurence finally told the crew to take away the remainder of the carcasses. “We can 
hunt in the morning, there is no need to force yourself to eat,” he said. 
“Thank you; I truly do not feel very hungry at the moment,” Temeraire said, settling down his head. He 
was quiet while they cleaned him, until the crewmen had gone and left him alone with Laurence. His 
eyes were closed to slits, and for a moment Laurence wondered if he had fallen asleep; then he opened 
them a little more and asked softly, “Laurence, is it always so, after a battle?” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (138 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Laurence did not need to ask what he meant; Temeraire’s weariness and sorrow were apparent. It was 
hard to know how to answer; he wanted so very much to reassure. Yet he himself was still tense and 
angry, and while the sensation was familiar, its lingering was not. He had been in many actions, no less 
deadly or dangerous, but this one had differed in the crucial respect: when the enemy took aim at his 
charge, they were threatening not his ship, but his dragon, already the dearest creature to him in the 
world. Nor could he contemplate injury to Lily or Maximus or any of the members of the formation with 
any sort of detachment; they might not be his own Temeraire, but they were full comrades-in-arms as 
well. It was not at all the same, and the surprise attack had caught him unprepared in his mind. 
“It is often difficult afterwards, I am afraid, particularly when a friend has been injured, or perhaps 
killed,” he said finally. “I will say that I find this action especially hard to bear; there was nothing to be 
gained, for our part, and we did not seek it out.” 
“Yes, that is true,” Temeraire said, his ruff drooping low upon his neck. “It would be better if I could 
think we had all fought so hard, and Lily had been hurt, for some purpose. But they only came to hurt us, 
so we did not even protect anyone.” 
“That is not true at all; you protected Lily,” Laurence said. “And consider: the French made a very 
clever and skillful attack, taking us wholly by surprise, with a force equal to our own in numbers and 
superior in experience, and we defeated it and drove them off. That is something to be proud of, is it 
not?” 
“I suppose that is true,” Temeraire said; his shoulders settled as he relaxed. “If only Lily will be all 
right,” he added. 
“Let us hope so; be sure that all that can be done for her, will be,” Laurence said, stroking his nose. 
“Come now, you must be tired. Will you not sleep? Shall I read to you a little?” 
“I do not think I can sleep,” Temeraire said. “But I would like you to read to me, and I will lie quietly 
and rest.” He yawned as soon as he had finished saying this, and was asleep before Laurence had even 
taken the book out. The weather had finally turned, and the warm, even breaths rising from his nostrils 
made small puffs of fog in the crisp air. 
Leaving him to sleep, Laurence walked quickly back to the covert headquarters; the path through the 
dragon-fields was lit with hanging lanterns, and in any case he could see the windows up ahead. An 
easterly wind was carrying the salt air in from the harbor, mingled with the coppery smell of the warm 
dragons, already familiar and hardly noticed. He had a warm room on the second floor, with a window 
that looked out onto the back gardens, and his baggage had already been unpacked. He looked at the 
wrinkled clothes ruefully; evidently the servants at the covert had no more notion of packing than the 
aviators themselves did. 
There was a great noise of raised voices as he came into the senior officers’ dining room, despite the late 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (139 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
hour; the other captains of the formation were assembled at the long table where their own meal was 
going largely untouched. 
“Is there any word about Lily?” he asked, taking the empty chair between Berkley and Dulcia’s captain, 
Chenery; Captain Harcourt and Captain Little of Immortalis were the only ones not present. 
“He cut her to the bone, the great coward, but that is all we know,” Chenery said. “They are still sewing 
her up, and she hasn’t taken anything to eat.” 
Laurence knew that was a bad sign; injured dragons usually became ravenous, unless they were in very 
great pain. “Maximus and Messoria?” he asked, looking at Berkley and Sutton. 
“Ate well, and fast asleep,” Berkley said; his usually placid face was drawn and haggard, and he had a 
streak of dark blood running across his forehead into his bristly hair. “That was damned quick of you 
today, Laurence; we’d have lost her.” 
“Not quick enough,” Laurence said quietly, forestalling the murmur of agreement; he had not the least 
desire to be praised for this day’s work, though he was proud of what Temeraire had done. 
“Quicker than the rest of us,” Sutton said, draining his glass; from the looks of his cheeks and nose, it 
was not his first. “They caught us properly flat-footed, damned Frogs. What the devil they were doing to 
have a patrol there, I would like to know.” 
“The route from Laggan to Dover isn’t much of a secret, Sutton,” Little said, coming to the table; they 
dragged chairs about to make room for him at their end of the table. “Immortalis is settled and eating, by 
the by; speaking of which, please give me that chicken here.” He wrenched off a leg with his hands and 
tore into it hungrily. 
Looking at him, Laurence felt the first stirrings of appetite; the other captains seemed to feel the same 
way, and for the next ten minutes there was silence while they passed the plates around and concentrated 
on their food; they had none of them eaten since a hasty breakfast before dawn at the covert near 
Middlesbrough. The wine was not very good, but Laurence drank several glasses anyway. 
“I expect they’ve been lurking about between Felixstowe and Dover, just waiting to get a drop on us,” 
Little said after a while, wiping his mouth and continuing his earlier thought. “By God, if you ever catch 
me taking Immortalis that way again; overland it is for us from now on, unless we’re looking for a 
fight.” 
“Right you are,” Chenery said, with heartfelt agreement. “Hello, Choiseul; pull up a chair.” He shuffled 
over a little more, and the royalist captain joined them. 
“Gentlemen, I am very happy to say that Lily has begun to eat; I have just come from Captain Harcourt,” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (140 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
he said, and raised a glass. “To their health, may I propose?” 
“Hear, hear,” Sutton said, refilling his own glass; they all joined in the toast, and there was a general 
sigh of relief. 
“Here you all are, then; eating, I hope? Good, very good.” Admiral Lenton had come up to join them; he 
was the commander-in-chief of the Channel Division, and thus all those dragons at the Dover covert. 
“No, don’t be fools, don’t get up,” he said impatiently, as Laurence and Choiseul began to rise, and the 
others belatedly followed. “After the day you’ve had, for Heaven’s sake. Here, pass that bottle over, 
Sutton. So, you all know that Lily is eating? Yes, the surgeons hope she will be flying short distances in 
a couple of weeks, and in the meantime you have at least nicely mauled a couple of their heavy-combat 
beasts. A toast to your formation, gentlemen.” 
Laurence was at last beginning to feel his tension and distress ease; knowing Lily and the others were 
out of danger was a great relief, and the wine had loosened the tight knot in his throat. The others 
seemed to feel much the same way, and conversation grew slow and fragmented; they were all much 
inclined to nod over their cups. 
“I am quite certain that the Grand Chevalier was Triumphalis,” Choiseul was telling Admiral Lenton 
quietly. “I have seen him before; he is one of France’s most dangerous fighters. He was certainly at the 
Dijon covert, near the Rhine, when Praecursoris and I left Austria, and I must represent to you, sir, that it 
bears out all my worst fears: Bonaparte would not have brought him here if he was not wholly confident 
of victory against Austria, and I am sure more of the French dragons are on their way to assist 
Villeneuve.” 
“I was inclined to agree with you before, Captain; now I am sure of it,” Lenton said. “But for the 
moment, all we can do is hope Mortiferus reaches Nelson before the French dragons reach Villeneuve, 
and that he can do the job; we cannot spare Excidium if we do not have Lily. I would not be surprised if 
that was what they intended by this strike; it is the clever sort of way that damned Corsican thinks.” 
Laurence could not help thinking of the Reliant, perhaps even now under the threat of a full-scale French 
aerial attack, and the other ships of the great fleet currently blockading Cadiz. So many of his friends 
and acquaintances; even if the French dragons did not arrive first, there would be a great naval battle to 
be fought, and how many would be lost without his ever hearing another word from them? He had not 
devoted much time to correspondence in the last busy months; now he regretted the neglect deeply. 
“Have we had any dispatches from the blockade at Cadiz?” he asked. “Have they seen any action?” 
“Not that I have heard of,” Lenton said. “Oh, that’s right, you’re our fellow from the Navy, aren’t you? 
Well, I will be starting those of you with uninjured beasts on patrolling over the Channel Fleet anyway 
while the others recover; you can touch down for a bit by the flagship and hear the news. They’ll be 
damned glad to see you; we haven’t been able to spare anyone long enough to bring them the post in a

month.” 
“Will you want us tomorrow, then?” Chenery asked, stifling a yawn, not entirely successfully. 
“No, I can spare you a day. See to your dragons, and enjoy the rest while it lasts,” Lenton said, with a 
sharp, braying laugh. “I’ll be having you rousted out of bed at dawn the day after.” 
  
Temeraire slept very heavily and late the next morning, leaving Laurence to occupy himself for some 
hours after breakfast. He met Berkley at the table, and walked back with him to see Maximus. The Regal 
Copper was still eating, a procession of fresh-slaughtered sheep going down his gullet one after another, 
and he only rumbled a wordless, mouth-full greeting as they came to the clearing. 
Berkley brought out a bottle of rather terrible wine, and drank most of it himself while Laurence sipped 
at his glass to be polite, as they told over the battle again with diagrams scratched in the dirt and pebbles 
representing the dragons. “We would do very well to add a light-flyer, a Greyling if one can be spared, 
to fly lookout above the formation,” Berkley said, sitting back heavily upon a rock. “It is all our big 
dragons being young; when the big ones panic in that way, the little ones will have a start even if they 
know better.” 
Laurence nodded. “Although I hope this misadventure will at least have given them some experience in 
dealing with the fright,” he said. “In any event, the French cannot count on having such ideal 
circumstances often; without the cloud cover they should never have managed it.” 
“Gentlemen; are you looking over the plan of yesterday?” Choiseul had been walking past towards the 
headquarters; he joined them and crouched down beside the diagram. “I am very sorry to have been 
away at the beginning.” His coat was dusty and his neckcloth was stained badly with sweat: he looked as 
though he had not shifted his clothes since yesterday, and a thin tracery of red veins stood out in the 
whites of his eyes; he rubbed his face as he looked down. 
“Have you been up all night?” Laurence asked. 
Choiseul shook his head. “No, but I took it in turns with Catherine—with Harcourt—to sleep a little, by 
Lily; she would not rest otherwise.” He shut his eyes in an enormous yawn, and nearly fell over. 
“Merci,” he said, grateful for Laurence’s steadying hand, and pushed himself slowly to his feet. “I will 
leave you; I must get Catherine some food.” 
“Pray go and get some rest,” Laurence said. “I will bring her something; Temeraire is asleep, and I am at 
liberty.”

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Harcourt herself was wide awake, pale with anxiety but steady now, giving orders to the crew and 
feeding Lily with chunks of still-steaming beef from her own hand, a constant stream of encouragement 
coming from her lips. Laurence had brought her some bread with bacon; she would have taken the 
sandwich in her bloody hands, unwilling to interrupt, but he managed to coax her away long enough to 
wash a little and eat while a crewman took her place. Lily kept eating, with one golden eye resting on 
Harcourt for reassurance. 
Choiseul came back before Harcourt had quite finished, his neckcloth and coat gone and a servant 
following with a pot of coffee, strong and hot. “Your lieutenant is looking for you, Laurence; Temeraire 
begins to stir,” he said, sitting down again heavily beside her. “I cannot manage to sleep; the coffee has 
done me well.” 
“Thank you, Jean-Paul, if you are not too tired, I would be very grateful for your company,” she said, 
already drinking her second cup. “Pray have no hesitation, Laurence, I am sure Temeraire must be 
anxious. I am obliged to you for coming.” 
Laurence bowed to them both, though he had a sense of awkwardness for the first occasion since he had 
grown used to Harcourt. She was leaning with no appearance of consciousness against Choiseul’s 
shoulder, and he was looking down at her with undisguised warmth; she was quite young, after all, and 
Laurence could not help feeling the absence of any suitable chaperone. 
He consoled himself that nothing could happen with Lily and the crew present, even if they had not both 
been so obviously done in; in any case, he could hardly stay under the circumstances, and he hurried 
away to Temeraire’s clearing. 
The rest of the day he spent gratefully in idleness, seated comfortably in his usual place in the crook of 
Temeraire’s foreleg and writing letters; he had formed an extensive correspondence while at sea, with all 
the long hours to fill, and now many of his acquaintance were owed responses. His mother, too, had 
managed to write him several hasty and short letters, evidently kept from his father’s knowledge; at least 
they were not franked, so Laurence was obliged to pay to receive them. 
Having gorged himself to compensate for his lack of appetite the night before, Temeraire then listened to 
the letters Laurence was writing and dictated his own contributions, sending greetings to Lady 
Allendale, and to Riley. “And do ask Captain Riley to give my best wishes to the crew of the Reliant,” 
he said. “It seems so very long ago, Laurence, does it not? I have not had fish in months now.” 
Laurence smiled at this measure of time. “A great deal has happened, certainly; it is strange to think it 
has not even been a year,” he said, sealing the envelope and writing the direction. “I only hope they are 
all well.” It was the last, and he laid it upon the substantial pile with satisfaction; he was a great deal 
easier in his conscience now. “Roland,” he called, and she came running up from where the cadets were 
playing a game of jacks. “Go take this to the dispatch post,” he said, handing her the stack.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Sir,” she said, a little nervously, accepting the letters, “when I am done, might I have liberty for the 
evening?” 
He was startled by the request; several of the ensigns and midwingmen had put in for liberty, and had it 
granted, that they might visit the city, but the idea of a ten-year-old cadet wandering about Dover alone 
was absurd, even if she were not a girl. “Would this be for yourself alone, or will you be going with one 
of the others?” he asked, thinking she might have been invited to join one of the older officers in a 
respectable excursion. 
“No, sir, only for me,” she said; she looked so very hopeful that Laurence thought for a moment of 
granting it and taking her himself, but he could not like to leave Temeraire alone to brood over the 
previous day. 
“Perhaps another time, Roland,” he said gently. “We will be here in Dover for a long time now, and I 
promise you will have another opportunity.” 
“Oh,” she said, downcast. “Yes, sir.” She went away drooping so that Laurence felt guilty. 
Temeraire watched her go and inquired, “Laurence, is there something particularly interesting in Dover, 
and might we go and see it? So many of our crew seem to be making a visit.” 
“Oh dear,” Laurence said; he felt rather awkward explaining that the main attraction was the abundance 
of harbor prostitutes and cheap liquor. “Well, a city has a great many people in it, and thus various 
entertainments provided in close proximity,” he tried. 
“Do you mean such as more books?” Temeraire said. “But I have never seen Dunne or Collins reading, 
and they were so very excited to be going: they talked of nothing else all yesterday evening.” 
Laurence silently cursed the two unfortunate young midwingmen for complicating his task, already 
planning their next week’s duties in a vengeful spirit. “There is also the theater, and concerts,” he said 
lamely. But this was carrying concealment too far: the sting of dishonesty was unpleasant, and he could 
not bear to feel he had been deceitful to Temeraire, who after all was grown now. “But I am afraid that 
some of them go there to drink, and keep low company,” he said more frankly. 
“Oh, you mean whores,” Temeraire said, startling Laurence so greatly he nearly fell from his seat. “I did 
not know they had those in cities, too, but now I understand.” 
“Where on earth had you heard of them?” Laurence asked, steadying himself; now relieved of the 
burden of explanation, he felt irrationally offended that someone else had chosen to enlighten Temeraire. 
“Oh, Victoriatus at Loch Laggan told me, for I wondered why the officers were going down to the 
village when they did not have family there,” Temeraire said. “But you have never gone; are you sure 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (144 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
you would not like to?” he added, almost hopefully. 
“My dear, you must not say such things,” Laurence said, blushing and shaking with laughter at the same 
time. “It is not a respectable subject for conversation, at all, and if men cannot be prevented from 
indulging the habit, they at least ought not to be encouraged. I shall certainly speak with Dunne and 
Collins; they ought not to be bragging about it, and especially not where the ensigns might hear.” 
“I do not understand,” Temeraire said. “Vindicatus said that it was prodigiously nice for men, and also 
desirable, for otherwise they might like to get married, and that did not sound very pleasant at all. 
Although if you very much wished to, I suppose I would not mind.” He made this last speech with very 
little sincerity, looking at Laurence sideways, as if to gauge the effect. 
Laurence’s mirth and embarrassment both faded at once. “I am afraid you have been given some very 
incomplete knowledge,” he said gently. “Forgive me; I ought to have spoken of these matters to you 
before. I must beg you to have no anxiety: you are my first charge and will always be, even if I should 
ever marry, and I do not suppose I will.” 
He paused a moment to reflect if speaking further would give Temeraire more worry, but in the end he 
decided to err on the side of full confidence, and added, “There was something of an understanding 
between myself and a lady, before you came to me, but she has since set me at liberty.” 
“Do you mean she has refused you?” Temeraire said, very indignantly, by way of demonstrating that 
dragons might be as contrary as men. “I am very sorry, Laurence; if you like to get married, I am sure 
you can find someone else, much nicer.” 
“This is very flattering, but I assure you, I have not the least desire to seek out a replacement,” Laurence 
said. 
Temeraire ducked his head a little, and made no further demurrals, quite evidently pleased. “But 
Laurence—” he said, then halted. “Laurence,” he asked, “if it is not a fit subject, does that mean I ought 
not speak of it anymore?” 
“You must be careful to avoid it in any wider company, but you may always speak of anything you like 
to me,” Laurence said. 
“I am merely curious, now, if that is all there is in Dover,” Temeraire said. “For Roland is too young for 
whores, is she not?” 
“I am beginning to feel the need of a glass of wine to fortify myself against this conversation,” Laurence 
said ruefully.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
  
Thankfully, Temeraire was satisfied with some further explanation of what the theater and concerts 
might be, and the other attractions of a city; he turned his attention willingly to a discussion of the 
planned route for their patrol, which a runner had brought over that morning, and even inquired about 
the possibility of catching some fish for dinner. Laurence was glad to see him so recovered in spirit after 
the previous day’s misfortunes, and had just decided that he would take Roland to the town after all, if 
Temeraire did not object, when he saw her returning in the company of another captain: a woman. 
He had been sitting upon Temeraire’s foreleg in what he was abruptly conscious was a state of disarray; 
he hurriedly climbed down on the far side so that he was briefly hidden by Temeraire’s body. There was 
no time to put back his coat, which was hung over a tree limb some distance away in any case, but he 
tucked his shirt back into his trousers and tied his neckcloth hastily back round his neck. 
He came around to make his bow, and nearly stumbled as he saw her clearly; she was not unhandsome, 
but her face was marred badly by a scar that could only have been made by a sword; the left eye drooped 
a little at the corner where the blade had just missed it, and the flesh was drawn along an angry red line 
all the way down her face, fading to a thinner white scar along her neck. She was his own age, or 
perhaps a little older; the scar made it difficult to tell, but in any case she wore the triple bars which 
marked her as a senior captain, and a small gold medal of the Nile in her lapel. 
“Laurence, is it?” she said, without waiting for any sort of introduction, while he was still busy striving 
to conceal his surprise. “I am Jane Roland, Excidium’s captain; I would take it as a personal favor if I 
might have Emily for the evening—if she can possibly be spared.” She glanced pointedly at the idle 
cadets and ensigns; her tone was sarcastic, and she was clearly offended. 
“I beg your pardon,” Laurence said, realizing his mistake. “I had thought she wanted liberty to visit the 
town; I did not realize—” And here he barely caught himself; he was quite sure they were mother and 
daughter, not only because of the shared name but also a certain similarity of feature and expression, but 
he could not simply make the assumption. “Certainly you may have her,” he finished instead. 
Hearing his explanation, Captain Roland unbent at once. “Ha! I see, what mischief you must have 
imagined her getting into,” she said; her laugh was curiously hearty and unfeminine. “Well, I promise I 
shan’t let her run wild, and to have her back by eight o’clock. Thank you; Excidium and I have not seen 
her in almost a year, and we are in danger of forgetting what she looks like.” 
Laurence bowed and saw them off; Roland hurrying to keep up with her mother’s long, mannish stride, 
speaking the whole time in obvious excitement and enthusiasm, and waving her hand towards her 
friends as she went away. Watching them go, Laurence felt a little foolish; he had at last grown used to 
Captain Harcourt, and should have been able to draw the natural conclusion. Excidium was after all 
another Longwing; presumably he too insisted on a female captain just as did Lily, and with his many 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (146 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
years of service, his captain could scarcely have avoided battle. Yet Laurence had to own he was 
surprised, and not a little shocked, to see a woman so cut about and so forward; Harcourt, his only other 
example of a female captain, was by no means missish, but she was still quite young and conscious of 
her early promotion, which perhaps made her less assured. 
With the subject of marriage so fresh in his mind after his discussion with Temeraire, he also could not 
help wondering about Emily’s father; if marriage was an awkward proposition for a male aviator, it 
seemed nearly inconceivable for a female one. The only thing he could imagine was that Emily was 
natural-born, and as soon as the idea occurred to him he scolded himself to be entertaining such thoughts 
about a perfectly respectable woman he had just met. 
But his involuntary guess proved entirely correct, in the event. “I am afraid I have not the slightest idea; 
I have not seen him in ten years,” she said, later that evening; she had invited him to join her for a late 
supper at the officers’ club after bringing Emily back, and after a few glasses of wine he had not been 
able to resist making a tentative inquiry after the health of Emily’s father. “It is not as though we were 
married, you know; I do not believe he even knows Emily’s name.” 
She seemed wholly unconscious of any shame, and after all Laurence had privately felt any more 
legitimate situation would have been impossible. But he was uncomfortable nevertheless; thankfully, 
though she noticed, she did not take any offense at it for herself, but rather said kindly, “I dare say our 
ways are still odd to you. But you can marry, if you like, it is not held against you at all in the Corps. It 
is only that it is rather hard on the other person, always taking second place to a dragon. For my own 
part, I have never felt anything wanting; I should never have desired children if it were not for 
Excidium’s sake, although Emily is a dear, and I am very happy to have her. But it was sadly 
inconvenient, for all that.” 
“So Emily is to follow you as his captain?” Laurence said. “May I ask you, are the dragons, the long-
lived ones, I mean, always inherited this way?” 
“When we can manage it; they take it very hard, you see, losing a handler, and they are more likely to 
accept a new one if it is someone they have some connection to, and whom they feel shares their grief,” 
she said. “So we breed ourselves as much as them; I expect they will be asking you to manage one or 
two for the Corps yourself.” 
“Good Lord,” he said, startled by the idea; he had discarded the thought of children with his plans of 
marriage, from the very moment of Edith’s refusal, and still further gone now that he was aware of 
Temeraire’s objections; he could not immediately imagine how he might arrange the matter. 
“I suppose it must be rather shocking to you, poor fellow. I am sorry,” she said. “I would offer, but you 
ought to wait until he is at least ten years old; and in any case I cannot be spared just now.” 
Laurence required a moment to understand what she meant, then he snatched up his wineglass with an 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (147 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
unsteady hand and endeavored to conceal his face behind it; he could feel color rising in his cheeks 
despite all the will in the world to prevent it. “Very kind,” he said into the cup, strangled half between 
mortification and laughter; it was not the sort of offer he had ever envisioned receiving, even if it had 
only half been made. 
“Catherine might do for you by then, however,” Roland went on, still in that appallingly practical tone. 
“That might do nicely, indeed; you could have one each for Lily and Temeraire.” 
“Thank you!” he said, very firmly, in desperation trying to change the subject. “May I bring you a glass 
of something to drink?” 
“Oh, yes; port would be splendid, thank you,” she said. By this time he was beyond being shocked; and 
when he returned with two glasses and she offered him an already-lit cigar, he shared it with her 
willingly. 
He stayed talking with her for several hours more, until they were the only ones left in the club and the 
servants were beginning to pointedly stop concealing their yawns. They climbed the stairs together. “It is 
not so very late as all that,” she said, looking at the handsome great clock at the end of the upper 
landing. “Are you very tired? We might have a hand or two of piquet in my rooms.” 
By this time he had begun to be so easy with her that he thought nothing of the suggestion. When he left 
her at last, very late, to return to his own rooms, a servant was walking down the hall and glanced at 
him; only then did he consider the propriety of his behavior and suffer a qualm. But the damage, if any, 
had already been done; he put it from his mind, and sought his bed at last. 
  
Chapter 10 
 
HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY experienced to no longer be very surprised, the next morning, when he found 
that their late night had led to no gossip. Instead, Captain Roland hailed him warmly at breakfast and 
introduced him to her lieutenants without the slightest consciousness, and they walked out to their 
dragons together. 
Laurence saw Temeraire finishing off a hearty breakfast of his own, and took a moment to have a private 
and forceful word with Collins and Dunne about their indiscretion. He did not mean to go on like a blue-
light captain, preaching chastity and temperance all day; still, he did not think it prudish if he preferred 
his youngsters to have a respectable example before them in the older officers. “If you must keep such 
company, I do not propose to have you making whoremongers of yourselves, and giving the ensigns and 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (148 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
cadets the notion that this is how they ought to behave,” he said, while the two midwingmen squirmed. 
Dunne even opened his mouth and looked as though he would rather like to protest, but subsided under 
Laurence’s very cold stare: that was a degree of insubordination he did not intend to permit. 
But having finished the lecture and dismissed them to their work, he found himself a trifle uneasy as he 
recalled that his own behavior of the previous night was not above reproach. He consoled himself by the 
reminder that Roland was a fellow-officer; her company could hardly be compared to that of whores, 
and in any case they had not created any sort of public spectacle, which was at the heart of the matter. 
However, the rationalization rang a little hollow, and he was glad to distract himself with work: Emily 
and the two other runners were already waiting by Temeraire’s side with the heavy bags of post that had 
accumulated for the blockading fleet. 
The very strength of the British fleet left the ships on the blockade in strangely isolated circumstances. It 
was rarely necessary for a dragon to be sent to their assistance; they received all but their most urgent 
dispatches and supplies by frigate, and so had little opportunity to hear recent news or receive their post. 
The French might have twenty-one ships in Brest, but they did not dare come out to face the far more 
skilled British sailors. Without naval support, even a full French heavy-combat wing would not risk a 
strafing run with the sharpshooters always ready in the tops and the harpoon and pepper guns primed 
upon the deck. Occasionally there might be an attack at night, usually made by a single nocturnal-breed 
dragon, but the riflemen often gave as good as they got in such circumstances, and if a full-scale attack 
were ever launched, a flare signal could easily be seen by the patrolling dragons to the north. 
Admiral Lenton had decided to reorder the uninjured dragons of Lily’s formation as necessary from day 
to day, to both keep the dragons occupied and patrol a somewhat greater extent. Today he had ordered 
Temeraire to fly point, with Nitidus and Dulcia flanking him: they would trail Excidium’s formation on 
the first leg of Channel patrol, then break off for a pass over the main squadron of the Channel Fleet, 
currently just off Ushant and blockading the French port of Brest. Aside from the more martial benefits, 
their visit would furnish the ships of the fleet with at least a little break in the lonely monotony of their 
blockade-duty. 
The morning was so cold and crisp no fog had gathered, the sky sharply brilliant and the water below 
almost black. Squinting against the glare, Laurence would have liked to imitate the ensigns and 
midwingmen, who were rubbing black kohl under their eyes, but as point-leader, he would be in 
command of the small group while they were detached, and he would likely be asked aboard to see 
Admiral Lord Gardner when they landed at the flagship. 
Thanks to the weather, it was a pleasant flight, even if not a very smooth one: wind currents seemed to 
vary unpredictably once they had moved out over the open water, and Temeraire followed some 
unconscious instinct in rising and falling to catch the best wind. After an hour’s patrol, they reached the 
point of separation; Captain Roland raised a hand in farewell as Temeraire angled away south and swept 
past Excidium; the sun was nearly straight overhead, and the ocean glittered beneath them. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (149 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Laurence, I see the ships ahead,” Temeraire said, perhaps half an hour later, and Laurence lifted his 
telescope, having to cup a hand around his eye and squint against the sun before he could see the sails on 
the water. 
“Well sighted,” Laurence called back, and said, “Give them the private signal if you please, Mr. 
Turner.” The signal-ensign began running up the pattern of flags that would mark them as a British 
party; less of a formality in their case, thanks to Temeraire’s unusual appearance. 
Shortly they were sighted and identified; the leading British ship fired a handsome salute of nine guns, 
more perhaps than was strictly due to Temeraire, as he was not an official formation leader. Whether it 
was misunderstanding or generosity, Laurence was pleased by the attention, and had the riflemen fire off 
a return salute as they swept by overhead. 
The fleet was a stirring sight, with the lean and elegant cutters already leaping across the water to cluster 
around the flagship in anticipation of the post, and the great ships-of-the-line tacking steadily into the 
northerly wind to keep their positions, white sails brilliant against the water, colors flying in proud 
display from every mainmast. Laurence could not resist leaning forward to watch over Temeraire’s 
shoulder, so far that the carabiner straps drew taut. 
“Signal from the flagship, sir,” Turner said, as they drew near enough for the flags to be readable. 
“Captain come aboard on landing.” 
Laurence nodded; no less than he had anticipated. “Pray acknowledge, Mr. Turner. Mr. Granby, I think 
we will do a pass over the rest of the fleet to the south, while they make ready for us.” The crew of the 
Hibernia and the neighboring Agincourt had begun casting out the floating platforms that would be 
lashed together to form a landing surface for the dragons, and a small cutter was already moving among 
them, gathering up the tow-lines. Laurence knew from experience that the operation required some time, 
and would go no quicker with the dragons circling directly overhead. 
By the time they had completed their sweep and returned, the platforms were ready. “Bellmen up above, 
Mr. Granby,” Laurence ordered; the crew of the lower rigging quickly came scrambling up onto 
Temeraire’s back. The last few sailors hastily cleared off the deck as Temeraire made his descent, with 
Nitidus and Dulcia following close upon him; the platform bobbed and sank lower in the water as 
Temeraire’s great weight came upon it, but the lashings held secure. Nitidus and Dulcia landed at 
opposite corners once Temeraire had settled himself, and Laurence swung himself down. “Runners, 
bring the post,” he said, and himself took the sealed envelope of dispatches from Admiral Lenton to 
Admiral Gardner. 
Laurence climbed easily into the waiting cutter, while his runners Roland, Dyer, and Morgan hurried to 
hand the bags of post over to the outstretched hands of the sailors. He went to the stern; Temeraire was 
sprawled low to better preserve the balance of the platform, with his head resting upon the edge of the 
platform very close to the cutter, much to the discomfort of that vessel’s crew. “I will return presently,”

Laurence told him. “Pray give Lieutenant Granby the word if you require anything.” 
“I will, but I do not think I will need to; I am perfectly well,” Temeraire answered, to startled looks from 
the cutter’s crew, which only increased as he added, “But if we could go hunting afterwards, I would be 
glad of it; I am sure I saw some splendid large tunnys on our way.” 
The cutter was an elegant, clean-lined vessel, and she bore Laurence to the Hibernia at a pace which he 
would once have thought the height of speed; now he stood looking out along her bowsprit, running 
before the wind, and the breeze in his face seemed barely anything. 
They had rigged a bosun’s chair over the Hibernia’s side, which Laurence ignored with disdain; his sea-
legs had scarcely deserted him, and in any case climbing up the side presented him with no difficulty. 
Captain Bedford was waiting to greet him, and started in open surprise as Laurence climbed aboard: they 
had served together in the Goliath at the Nile. 
“Good Lord, Laurence; I had no notion of your being here in the Channel,” he said, formal greeting 
forgotten, and meeting him instead with a hearty handshake. “Is that your beast, then?” he asked, staring 
across the water at Temeraire, who was in his bulk not much smaller than the seventy-four-gun 
Agincourt behind him. “I thought he had only just hatched a sixmonth gone.” 
Laurence could not help a swelling pride; he hoped that he concealed it as he answered, “Yes, that is 
Temeraire. He is not yet eight months old, yet he does have nearly his full growth.” With difficulty he 
restrained himself from boasting further; nothing, he was sure, could be more irritating, like one of those 
men who could not stop talking of the beauty of their mistress, or the cleverness of their children. In any 
case, Temeraire did not require praising; any observer looking at him could hardly fail to mark his 
distinctive and elegant appearance. 
“Oh, I see,” Bedford said, looking at him with a bemused expression. Then the lieutenant at Bedford’s 
shoulder coughed meaningfully. Bedford glanced at the fellow and then said, “Forgive me; I was so 
taken aback to see you that I have been keeping you standing about. Pray come this way, Lord Gardner 
is waiting to see you.” 
Admiral Lord Gardner had only lately come to his position as commander in the Channel, on Sir 
William Cornwallis’s retirement; the strain of following so successful a leader in so difficult a position 
was telling upon him. Laurence had served in the Channel Fleet several years before, as a lieutenant; 
they had never been introduced previously, but Laurence had seen him several times, and his face was 
markedly aged. 
“Yes, I see, Laurence, is it?” Gardner said, as the flag-lieutenant presented him, and murmured a few 
words which Laurence could not hear. “Pray be seated; I must read these dispatches at once, and then I 
have a few words to give you to carry back for me to Lenton,” he said, breaking the seal and studying 
the contents. Lord Gardner grunted and nodded to himself as he read through the messages; from his

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
sharp look, Laurence knew when he reached the account of the recent skirmish. 
“Well, Laurence, you have already seen some sharp action, I gather,” he said, laying aside the papers at 
last. “It is just as well for you all to get some seasoning, I expect; it cannot be long before we see 
something more from them, and you must tell Lenton so for me. I have been sending every sloop and 
brig and cutter I dare to risk close in to the shore, and the French are busy as bees inland outside 
Cherbourg. We cannot tell with what, precisely, but they can hardly be preparing for anything but 
invasion, and judging by their activity, they mean it to be soon.” 
“Surely Bonaparte cannot have more news of the fleet in Cadiz than do we?” Laurence said, disturbed 
by this intelligence. The degree of confidence augured by such preparations was frighteningly high, and 
though Bonaparte was certainly arrogant, his arrogance had rarely proven to be wholly unfounded. 
“Not of immediate events, no, of that I am now thankfully certain. You have brought me confirmation 
that our dispatch-riders have been coming back and forth steadily,” Gardner said, tapping the sheaf of 
papers on his desk. “However, he cannot be so wild as to imagine he can come across without his fleet, 
and that suggests he expects them soon.” 
Laurence nodded; that expectation might still be ill-founded or wishful, but that Bonaparte had it at all 
meant Nelson’s fleet was in imminent danger. 
Gardner sealed the packet of returning dispatches and handed them over. “There; I am much obliged to 
you, Laurence, and for your bringing the post to us. Now I trust you will join us for dinner, and of course 
your fellow captains as well?” he said, rising from his desk. “Captain Briggs of the Agincourt will join 
us as well, I think.” 
A lifetime of naval training had inculcated in Laurence the precept that such an invitation from a 
superior officer was as good as a command, and though Gardner was no longer strictly his superior, it 
remained impossible to even think of refusing. But Laurence could not help but consider Temeraire with 
some anxiety, and Nitidus with even more. The Pascal’s Blue was a nervous creature who required a 
great deal of careful management from Captain Warren under ordinary circumstances, and Laurence was 
certain that he would be distressed at the prospect of remaining aboard the makeshift floating platform 
without his handler and no officer above the rank of lieutenant anywhere to be seen. 
And yet dragons did wait under such conditions all the time; if there had been a greater aerial threat 
against the fleet, several might even have been stationed upon platforms at all times, with their captains 
frequently called upon to join the naval officers in planning. Laurence could not like subjecting the 
dragons to such a wait for no better cause than a dinner engagement, but neither could he honestly say 
there was any actual risk to them. 
“Sir, nothing could give me greater pleasure, and I am sure I speak for Captain Warren and Captain 
Chenery as well,” he said: there was nothing else to be done. Indeed Gardner could hardly be said to be 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (152 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
waiting for an answer; he had already gone to the door to call in his lieutenant. 
However, only Chenery came over in response to the signaled invitation, bearing sincere but mild 
regrets. “Nitidus will fret if he is left alone, you see, so Warren thinks it much better if he does not leave 
him,” was all the explanation he offered, made to Gardner very cheerfully; he seemed unconscious of 
the deep solecism he was committing. 
Laurence privately winced at the startled and somewhat offended looks this procured, not merely from 
Lord Gardner but from the other captains and the flag-lieutenant as well, though he could not help but 
feel relieved. Still the dinner began awkwardly, and continued so. 
The admiral was clearly oppressed by thoughts of his work, and there were long periods between his 
remarks. The table would have been a silent and heavy one, save that Chenery was in his usual form, 
high-spirited and quick to make conversation, and he spoke freely in complete disregard of the naval 
convention that reserved the right of starting conversation to Lord Gardner. 
When addressed directly, the naval officers would pause very pointedly before responding to him, as 
briefly as possible, before dropping the subject. Laurence was at first agonized on his behalf, and then 
began to grow angry. It must have been clear to even the most sensitive temper that Chenery was 
speaking in ignorance; his chosen subjects were innocuous, and to sit in sullen and reproachful silence 
seemed to Laurence a far greater piece of rudeness. 
Chenery could not help but notice the cold response; as yet he was only beginning to look puzzled, not 
offended, but that would hardly last. When he gamely tried once more, this time Laurence deliberately 
volunteered a reply. The two of them carried the discussion along between them for several minutes, and 
then Gardner, his attention drawn from his brown study, glanced up and contributed a remark. The 
conversation was thus blessed, and the other officers joined in at last; Laurence made a great effort, and 
kept the topic running throughout the rest of the meal. 
What ought to have been a pleasure thus became a chore, and he was very glad when the port was taken 
off the table, and they were invited to step up on deck for cigars and coffee. Taking his cup, he went to 
stand by the larboard taffrail to better see the floating platform: Temeraire was sleeping quietly with the 
sun beating on his scales, one foreleg dangling over the side into the water, and Nitidus and Dulcia were 
resting against him. 
Bedford came to stand and look with him, in what Laurence took as companionable silence; after a 
moment Bedford said, “I suppose he is a valuable animal and we must be glad to have him, but it is 
appalling you should be chained to such a life, and in such company.” 
Laurence could not immediately command the power of speech in response to this remark so full of 
sincere pity; half a dozen answers all crowded to his lips. He drew a breath that shook in his throat and 
said in a low, savage voice, “Sir, you will not speak to me in such terms, either of Temeraire or of my 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (153 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
colleagues; I wonder that you could imagine such an address acceptable.” 
Bedford stepped back from his vehemence. Laurence turned away and left his coffee cup clattering upon 
the steward’s tray. “Sir, I think we must be leaving,” he said to Gardner, keeping his voice even. “As 
this is Temeraire’s first flight along this course, best were we to return before sunset.” 
“Of course,” Gardner said, offering a hand. “Godspeed, Captain; I hope we will see you again shortly.” 
  
Despite this excuse, Laurence did not find himself back at the covert until shortly after nightfall. Having 
seen Temeraire snatch several large tunnys from the water, Nitidus and Dulcia expressed the inclination 
to try fishing themselves, and Temeraire was perfectly happy to continue demonstrating. The younger 
crewmen were not entirely prepared for the experience of being on board while their dragon hunted; but 
after the first plummeting drop had accustomed them to the experience, the startled yells vanished, and 
they rapidly came to view the process as a game. 
Laurence found that his black mood could not survive their enthusiasm: the boys cheered wildly each 
time Temeraire rose up with yet another tunny wriggling in his claws, and several of them even sought 
permission to climb below, the better to be splashed as Temeraire made his catch. 
Thoroughly glutted and flying somewhat more slowly back towards the coast, Temeraire hummed in 
happiness and contentment, turned his head around to look at Laurence with bright-eyed gratitude, and 
said, “Has this not been a pleasant day? It has been a long time since we have had such splendid flying,” 
and Laurence found that he had no anger left to conceal in making his reply. 
The lamps throughout the covert were just coming alight, like great fireflies against the darkness of the 
scattered trees, the ground crews moving among them with their torches even as Temeraire made his 
descent. Most of the younger officers were still soaking wet and beginning to shiver as they climbed 
down from Temeraire’s warm bulk; Laurence dismissed them to their rest and stood watch with 
Temeraire himself while the ground crew finished unharnessing him. Hollin looked at him a little 
reproachfully as the men brought down the neck and shoulder harnesses, encrusted with fish scales, 
bones, and entrails, and already beginning to stink. 
Temeraire was too pleased and well-fed for Laurence to feel apologetic; he only said cheerfully, “I am 
afraid we have made some heavy work for you, Mr. Hollin, but at least he will not need feeding 
tonight.” 
“Aye, sir,” Hollin said gloomily, and marshaled his men to the task. 
The harness removed and his hide washed down by the crew, who by this time had formed the technique

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
of passing buckets along rather like a fire brigade to clean him after his meals, Temeraire yawned 
enormously, belched, and sprawled out upon the ground with so self-satisfied an expression that 
Laurence laughed at him. “I must go and deliver these dispatches,” he said. “Will you sleep, or shall we 
read this evening?” 
“Forgive me, Laurence, I think I am too sleepy,” Temeraire said, yawning again. “Laplace is difficult to 
follow even when I am quite awake, and I do not want to risk misunderstanding.” 
As Laurence had enough difficulty for his own part merely in pronouncing the French of Laplace’s 
treatise on celestial mechanics well enough for Temeraire to comprehend, without making any effort to 
himself grasp the principles he was reading aloud, he was perfectly willing to believe this. “Very well, 
my dear; I will see you in the morning, then,” he said, and stood stroking Temeraire’s nose until the 
dragon’s eyes had slid shut, and his breathing had evened out into slumber. 
  
Admiral Lenton received the dispatches and the verbal message with frowning concern. “I do not like it 
in the least, not in the least,” he said. “Working inland, is he? Laurence, could he be building more boats 
on shore, planning to add to his fleet without our knowing?” 
“Some awkward transports he might perhaps be able to make, sir, but never ships-of-the-line,” Laurence 
said at once, with perfect certainty on the subject. “And he already has a great many transports, in every 
port along the coastline; it is difficult to conceive that he might require more.” 
“And all this is around Cherbourg, not Calais, though the distance is greater, and our fleet is closer by. I 
cannot account for it, but Gardner is quite right; I am damned sure he means mischief, and he cannot 
very well do it until his fleet is here.” Abruptly he stood and walked straight from the office; unsure 
whether to take this as a dismissal, Laurence followed him through the headquarters and outside, to the 
clearing where Lily was lying in her recovery. 
Captain Harcourt was sitting by Lily’s head, stroking her foreleg, over and over; Choiseul was with her 
and reading quietly to them both. Lily’s eyes were still dull with pain, but in a more encouraging sign, 
she had evidently just eaten whole food at last, for there was a great heap of cracked bones still being 
cleared away by the ground crew. 
Choiseul put down his book and said a quiet word to Harcourt, then came to them. “She is almost asleep; 
I beg you not to stir her,” he said, very softly. 
Lenton nodded and beckoned him and Laurence both further away. “How does she progress?” he asked. 
“Very well, sir, according to the surgeons; they say she heals as quickly as could be hoped,” Choiseul 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (155 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
said. “Catherine has not left her side.” 
“Good, good,” Lenton said. “Three weeks, then, if their original estimate holds true. Well, gentlemen, I 
have changed my mind; I am going to send Temeraire out on patrol every day during her recovery, 
rather than giving him and Praecursoris turn and turn about. You do not need the experience, Choiseul, 
and Temeraire does; you will have to keep Praecursoris exercised independently.” 
Choiseul bowed, with no hint of dissatisfaction, if he felt any. “I am happy to serve in any way I can, sir; 
you need merely direct me.” 
Lenton nodded. “Well, and for now, stay with Harcourt as much as ever you can; I am sure you know 
what it is to have a wounded beast,” he said. Choiseul rejoined her by the now-sleeping Lily, and Lenton 
led Laurence away again, scowling in private thought. “Laurence,” he said, “while you patrol, I want 
you to try and run formation maneuvers with Nitidus and Dulcia; I know you have not been trained to 
small-formation work, but Warren and Chenery can help you there. I want him able to lead a pair of 
light-combatants in a fight independently, if need be.” 
“Very good, sir,” Laurence said, a little startled; he wanted badly to ask for some explanation, and 
repressed his curiosity with some difficulty. 
They came to the clearing where Excidium was just falling asleep; Captain Roland was speaking with 
her ground crewmen and inspecting a piece of the harness. She nodded to them both and came away 
with them; they walked back together towards the headquarters. 
“Roland, can you do without Auctoritas and Crescendium?” Lenton asked abruptly. 
She lifted an eyebrow at him. “If I have to, of course,” she said. “What’s this about?” 
Lenton did not seem to object to being so directly queried. “We must begin to think about sending 
Excidium to Cadiz once Lily is flying well,” he said. “I am not going to have the kingdom lost for want 
of one dragon in the right place; we can hold out against aerial raids a long time here, with the help of 
the Channel Fleet and the shore batteries, and that fleet must not be allowed to escape.” 
If Lenton did choose to send Excidium and his formation away, their absence would leave the Channel 
vulnerable to aerial attack; yet if the French and Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz and came north, to join 
with the ships in port at Brest and Calais, perhaps even a single day of so overwhelming an advantage 
would be enough for Napoleon to ferry over his invasion force. 
Laurence did not envy Lenton the decision; without knowing whether Bonaparte’s aerial divisions were 
halfway to Cadiz overland or still along the Austrian border, the choice could only be half guess. Yet it 
would have to be made, if only through inaction, and Lenton was clearly prepared instead to take the 
risk. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (156 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Now Lenton’s design with regard to Temeraire’s orders was clear: the admiral wanted the flexibility of 
having a second formation on hand, even if a small and imperfectly trained one. Laurence thought that 
he recalled that Auctoritas and Crescendium were middle-weight combat dragons, part of Excidium’s 
supporting forces; perhaps Lenton intended to match them with Temeraire, to make a maneuverable 
strike force of the three of them. 
“Trying to out-guess Bonaparte; the thought makes my blood run cold,” Captain Roland said, echoing 
Laurence’s sentiments. “But we will be ready to go whenever you want to send us; I will fly maneuvers 
without Auctor and Cressy as time allows.” 
“Good, see to it,” Lenton said, as they climbed the stairs to the foyer. “I will leave you now; I have 
another ten dispatches to read yet, more’s the pity. Goodnight, gentlemen.” 
“Goodnight, Lenton,” Roland said, and stretched out with a yawn when he was gone. “Ah well, 
formation flying would be deadly boring without a change-about every so often, any road. What do you 
say to some supper?” 
They had some soup and toasted bread, and a nice Stilton after, with port, and once again settled in 
Roland’s room for some piquet. After a few hands, and some idle conversation, she said, with the first 
note of diffidence he had ever heard from her, “Laurence, may I make so bold—” 
The question made him stare, as she had never before hesitated to forge ahead on any subject 
whatsoever. “Certainly,” he said, trying to imagine what she could possibly mean to ask him. Abruptly 
he was aware of his surroundings: the large and rumpled bed, less than ten steps away; the open throat of 
her dressing-gown, for which she had exchanged her coat and breeches, behind a screen, when they first 
came into the room. He looked down at his cards, his face heating; his hands trembled a little. 
“If you have any reluctance, I beg you to tell me at once,” she added. 
“No,” Laurence said at once, “I would be very happy to oblige you. I am sure,” he added belatedly, as he 
realized she had not yet asked. 
“You are very kind,” she said, and a wide flash of a smile crossed her face, lopsidedly, the right side of 
her mouth turning up more than the scarred left. Then she went on, “And I would be very grateful if you 
would tell me, with real honesty, what you think of Emily’s work, and of her inclination for the life.” 
He was hard-pressed not to turn crimson at his mistaken assumption, even as she added, “I know it is a 
wretched thing to ask you to speak ill of her to me, but I have seen what comes of relying too heavily 
upon the line of succession, without good training. If you have any cause to doubt her suitability, I beg 
you to tell me now, while there still may be time to repair the fault.” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (157 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Her anxiety was very plain now, and thinking of Rankin and his disgraceful treatment of Levitas, 
Laurence could well understand it; sympathy enabled him to recover from his self-inflicted 
embarrassment. “I have seen the consequences of what you describe as well,” he said, quick to reassure 
her. “I promise you I would speak frankly if I saw any such signs; indeed, I should never have taken her 
on as a runner if I were not entirely convinced of her reliability, and her dedication to her duty. She is 
too young for certainty, of course, but I think her very promising.” 
Roland blew out a breath gustily and sat back in her chair, letting her hand of cards drop as she stopped 
even pretending to be paying them attention. “Lord, how you relieve me,” she said. “I hoped, of course, 
but I find I cannot trust myself on the subject.” She laughed with relief, and went to her bureau for a new 
bottle of wine. 
Laurence held out his glass for her to fill. “To Emily’s success,” he proposed, and they drank; then she 
reached out, took the glass from his hand, and kissed him. He had indeed been wholly mistaken; on this 
matter, she proved not at all tentative. 
  
Chapter 11 
 
LAURENCE COULD NOT help wincing at the haphazard way in which Jane threw her things out of the 
wardrobe and into heaps upon the bed. “May I help you?” he asked finally, out of desperation, and took 
possession of her baggage. “No, I beg you, permit me the liberty; you may consider your flight path as I 
do this,” he said. 
“Thank you, Laurence, that is very kind of you.” She sat down with her maps instead. “It will be a 
straightforward flight, I hope,” she went on, scribbling calculations and moving the small bits of wood 
which she was using to represent the scattered dragon transport ships that would provide Excidium and 
his formation with resting places on their way to Cadiz. “So long as the weather holds, less than two 
weeks should see us there.” With so much urgent need, the dragons would not be going by a single 
transport, but rather would fly from one transport to another, attempting to predict their locations based 
on the current and the wind. 
Laurence nodded, though a little grimly; they were only a day shy of October, and there was every 
likelihood at this time of year that the weather would not hold. Then she would be faced with the 
dangerous choice of trying to find a transport that might easily have been blown off-course, or seeking 
shelter inland in the face of Spanish artillery. Presuming, of course, that the formation was not itself 
brought down by a storm: dragons were from time to time cast down by lightning or heavy winds, and if 
flung into a heavy ocean, they could easily drown with all their crew. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (158 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
But there was no choice. Lily had recovered with great speed over the intervening weeks; she had led the 
formation through a full patrol only yesterday, and landed without pain or stiffness. Lenton had looked 
her over, spoken a few words with her and Captain Harcourt, and gone straightaway to give Jane her 
orders for Cadiz. Laurence had been expecting as much, of course, but he could not help feeling 
concern, both for the dragons going and for those remaining behind. 
“There, that will do,” she said, finishing her chart and throwing down her pen; he looked up from the 
baggage in surprise: he had fallen into a brown study and packed mechanically, without marking what 
he did; now he realized that he had been silent for nearly twenty minutes together, and that he had one of 
her stays in his hands. He hastily dropped it atop the neatly packed things in her small case, and closed 
the lid. 
The sunlight was beginning to come in at the window; their time was gone. “There, Laurence, do not 
look so glum; I have made the flight to Gibraltar a dozen times,” she said, coming to kiss him soundly. 
“You will have a worse time of it here, I am afraid; they will undoubtedly try some mischief once they 
know we are gone.” 
“I have every confidence in you,” Laurence said, ringing the bell for the servants. “I only hope we have 
not misjudged.” It was as much as he would say critical of Lenton, particularly on a subject where he 
could not be unbiased. Yet he felt that even if he had not had a personal objection to make to placing 
Excidium and his formation in danger, he would still have been concerned by the lack of further 
intelligence. 
Volly had arrived three days before with a report full of fresh negatives. A handful of French dragons 
had arrived in Cadiz: enough to keep Mortiferus from forcing out the fleet, but not a tenth of the dragons 
which had been stationed along the Rhine. And in cause for more concern, even though nearly every 
light and quick dragon not wholly involved in dispatch service had been pressed into scouting and 
spying, they still knew nothing more of Bonaparte’s work across the Channel. 
He walked with her to Excidium’s clearing and saw her aboard; it was strange, for he felt as though he 
ought to feel more. He would have put a bullet in his brains sooner than let Edith go to face danger while 
he remained behind himself, yet he could say his adieus to Roland without much more of a pang than in 
bidding farewell to any other comrade. She blew him a friendly kiss from atop Excidium’s back, once 
her crew were all aboard. “I will see you in a few months, I am sure, or sooner if we can chase the Frogs 
out of harbor,” she called down. “Fair winds, and mind you don’t let Emily run wild.” 
He raised a hand to her. “Godspeed,” he called, and stood watching as the enormous wings carried 
Excidium up, the other dragons of his formation rising to join him, until they had all dwindled out of 
sight to the south.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Although they kept a wary eye on the Channel skies, the first weeks after Excidium’s departure were 
quiet. No raids came, and Lenton was of the opinion that the French still thought Excidium was in 
residence, and were correspondingly reluctant to make any venture. “The longer we can keep them 
thinking it, the better,” he said to the assembled captains after another uneventful patrol. “Aside from the 
benefit to us, just as well if they don’t realize another formation is nearing their precious fleet at Cadiz.” 
They all took a great measure of comfort from the news of Excidium’s safe arrival, which Volly brought 
almost two weeks to the day from his departure. “They’d already begun when I left,” Captain James told 
the other captains the next day, taking a hurried breakfast before setting out on his return journey. “You 
could hear the Spaniards howling for miles: their merchantmen are as quick to fall apart under dragon-
spray as any ship-of-the-line, and their shops and houses as well. I expect they’ll fire on the Frenchmen 
themselves if Villeneuve doesn’t come out soon, alliance or not.” 
The atmosphere grew lighter after this encouraging news, and Lenton cut their patrol a little short and 
granted them all liberty for celebration, a welcome respite to men who had been working at a frenetic 
pace. The more energetic went into town; most seized a little sleep, as did the weary dragons. 
Laurence took the opportunity to enjoy a quiet evening’s reading with Temeraire; they stayed together 
late into the night, reading by the light of the lanterns. Laurence woke out of a light doze some time after 
the moon had risen: Temeraire’s head was dark against the illuminated sky, and he was looking 
searchingly to the north of their clearing. “Is something the matter?” Laurence asked him. Sitting up, he 
could hear a faint noise, strange and high. 
Even as they listened, the sound stopped. “Laurence, that was Lily, I think,” Temeraire said, his ruff 
standing up stiffly. 
Laurence slid down at once. “Stay here; I will return as quickly as I may,” he said, and Temeraire 
nodded without ever looking away. 
The paths through the covert were largely deserted and unlit: Excidium’s formation gone, all the light 
dragons out on scouting duty, and the night cold enough to send even the most dedicated crews into the 
barracks buildings. The ground had frozen three days before; it was packed and hard enough for his 
heels to drum hollowly upon it as he walked. 
Lily’s clearing was empty; a faint murmur of noise from the barracks, whose lit windows he could see 
distantly, through the trees, and no one about the buildings. Lily herself was crouched motionless, her 
yellow eyes red-rimmed and staring, and she was clawing the ground silently. Low voices, and the 
sound of crying; Laurence wondered if he was intruding untimely, but Lily’s evident distress decided 
him: he walked into the clearing, calling in a strong voice, “Harcourt? Are you there?” 
“No further” came Choiseul’s voice, low and sharp: Laurence came around Lily’s head and halted in

dreadful surprise: Choiseul was holding Harcourt by the arm, and there was an expression of complete 
despair on his face. “Make no sound, Laurence,” he said; there was a sword in his hand, and behind him 
on the ground Laurence could see a young midwingman stretched out, dark bloodstains spreading over 
the back of his coat. “No sound at all.” 
“For God’s sake, what do you think you are about?” Laurence said. “Harcourt, is it well with you?” 
“He has killed Wilpoys,” she said thickly; she was wavering where she stood, and as the torchlight came 
on her face he could see a bruise already darkening across half her forehead. “Laurence, never mind 
about me, you must go and fetch help; he means to do Lily a mischief.” 
“No, never, never,” Choiseul said. “I mean no harm to her or you, Catherine, I swear it. But I will not be 
answerable if you interfere, Laurence; do nothing.” He raised the sword; blood gleamed on its edge, not 
far from Harcourt’s neck, and Lily made the thin eerie noise again, a high-pitched whining that grated 
against the ear. Choiseul was pale, his face taking on a greenish cast in the light, and he looked desperate 
enough to do anything; Laurence kept his position, hoping for a better moment. 
Choiseul stood staring at him a moment longer, until satisfied Laurence did not mean to go, and then 
said, “We will go all of us together to Praecursoris; Lily, you will stay here, and follow when you see us 
go aloft: I promise you no harm will come to Catherine so long as you obey.” 
“Oh, you miserable, cowhearted traitor dog,” Harcourt said, “do you think I am going to go to France 
with you, and lick Bonaparte’s boots? How long have you been planning this?” She struggled to pull 
away from him, even staggering as she was, but Choiseul shook her and she nearly fell. 
Lily snarled, half-rising, her wings mantling: Laurence could see the black acid glistening at the edges of 
her bone spurs. “Catherine!” she hissed, the sound distorted through her clenched teeth. 
“Silence, enough,” Choiseul said, pulling Harcourt up and close to his body, pinning her arms: the sword 
still held steady in his other hand, Laurence’s eyes always upon it, waiting for a chance. “You will 
follow, Lily; you will do as I have said. We are going now; march, at once, monsieur, there.” He 
gestured with the sword. Laurence did not turn around, but stepped backwards, and once beneath the 
shadow of the trees he moved more slowly still, so that Choiseul came unknowingly closer than he 
meant to do. 
A moment of wild grappling: then they all three went to the ground in a heap, the sword flying and 
Harcourt caught between them. They struck the ground heavily, but Choiseul was beneath, and for a 
moment Laurence had the advantage; he was forced to sacrifice it to roll Harcourt free and out of harm’s 
way, and Choiseul struck him across the face as soon as she was clear, throwing him off. 
They rolled about on the ground, battering at each other awkwardly, both trying to reach for the sword 
even as they struggled. Choiseul was powerfully built and taller, and though Laurence had a far greater

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
experience of close combat, the Frenchman’s weight began to tell as they wrestled. Lily was roaring out 
loud now, voices calling in the distance, and despair gave Choiseul a burst of strength: he drove a fist 
into Laurence’s stomach and lunged for the sword while Laurence curled gasping about the pain. 
Then there was a tremendous roaring above them: the ground shuddered, branches tumbling down in a 
rain of dry leaves and pine needles, and an immense old tree was wrenched whole out of the ground 
beside them: Temeraire was above them, beating wildly as he tore away the cover. More bellowing, now 
from Praecursoris: the French dragon’s pale marbled wings were visible in the dark, approaching, and 
Temeraire writhed around to face him, claws stretching out. Laurence dragged himself up and threw 
himself onto Choiseul, bearing him down to the ground with all his weight: he was retching even as they 
struggled, but Temeraire’s danger spurred him on. 
Choiseul managed to turn them over and force an arm against Laurence’s throat, pressing hard; choking, 
Laurence caught only a glimpse of motion, and then Choiseul went limp: Harcourt had fetched an iron 
bar from Lily’s gear and struck him upon the back of the head. 
She was nearly fainting with the effort, Lily trying to crowd between the trees to reach her; the crew 
were rushing into the clearing now at last, however, and many hands helped Laurence up to his feet. 
“Stand over that man there, bring torches,” Laurence said, gasping. “And get a full-voiced man here, 
with a speaking-trumpet; hurry, damn you,” for above, Temeraire and Praecursoris were still circling 
each other, claws flashing. 
Harcourt’s first lieutenant was a big-chested man with a voice that needed no trumpet: as soon as he 
understood the circumstances he cupped his hands around his mouth and bellowed up at Praecursoris. 
The big French dragon broke off and flew in wild desperate circles for a moment as he peered down to 
where Choiseul was being secured, and then with drooping head he returned to the ground, Temeraire 
hovering watchfully until he had landed. 
Maximus was housed not far off, and Berkley had come to the clearing on hearing the noise: he took 
charge now, setting men to chain Praecursoris, and others to bear Harcourt and Choiseul to the surgeons; 
still others to take away poor Wilpoys to be buried. “No, thank you, I can manage,” Laurence said, 
shaking off the willing hands that would have carried him as well; his breath was returning, and he 
walked slowly over to the clearing where Temeraire had landed beside Lily, to comfort both the dragons 
and try to calm them. 
  
Choiseul did not rouse for the better part of a day, and when he first woke he was thick-tongued and 
confused in his speech. Yet by the next morning, he was once again in command of himself, and at first 
refused to answer any questions whatsoever. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (162 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Praecursoris had been ringed round by all the other dragons, and ordered to remain on the ground under 
pain of Choiseul’s death: a threat to the handler was the one thing which could hold an unwilling dragon, 
and the means by which Choiseul had intended to force Lily to defect to France were now used against 
him. Praecursoris made no attempt to defy the command, but huddled into a miserable heap beneath his 
chains, eating nothing, and occasionally keening softly. 
“Harcourt,” Lenton said at last, coming into the dining room and finding them all assembled and 
waiting, “I am damned sorry, but I must ask you to try: he has not spoken to anyone else, but if he has 
the honor of a yellow rat he must feel some explanation owed you. Will you ask him?” 
She nodded, and then she drained her glass, but her face stayed so very pale that Laurence asked quietly, 
“Should you like me to accompany you?” 
“Yes, if you please,” she said at once, gratefully, and he followed her to the small, dark cell where 
Choiseul was incarcerated. 
Choiseul could not meet her gaze, nor speak to her; he shook his head and shuddered, and even wept as 
she asked him questions in an unsteady voice. “Oh damn you,” she cried at last, crackling with anger. 
“How could—how could you have a heart to do this? Every word you have said to me was a lie; tell me, 
did you even arrange that first ambush, on our way here? Tell me!” 
Her voice was breaking, and he had dropped his face into his hands; now he raised it and cried to 
Laurence, “For God’s sake, make her go; I will tell you anything you like, only send her out,” and 
dropped it back down again. 
Laurence did not in the least want to be his interrogator, but he could not prolong Harcourt’s suffering 
unnecessarily; he touched her on the shoulder, and she fled at once. It was deeply unpleasant to have to 
ask Choiseul questions, still more unpleasant to hear that he had been a traitor since coming from 
Austria. 
“I see what you think of me,” Choiseul added, noting the look of disgust on Laurence’s face. “And you 
have a right; but for me, there was no choice.” 
Laurence had been keeping himself strictly to questions, but this paltry attempt at excuse inflamed him 
beyond his resistance. With contempt, he said, “You might have chosen to be honest, and done your 
duty in the place you begged of us.” 
Choiseul laughed, with no mirth in the sound. “Indeed; and when Bonaparte is in London this 
Christmastime, what then? You may look at me that way if you like; I have no doubt of it, and I assure 
you if I thought any deed of mine could alter that outcome, I would have acted.” 
“Instead you have become a traitor twice over and helped him, when your first betrayal could only be

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
excused if you had been sincere in your principles,” Laurence said; he was disturbed by Choiseul’s 
certainty, though he would never conceive of giving any sign as much. 
“Ah, principles,” Choiseul said; all his bravado had deserted him, and he seemed now only weary and 
resigned. “France is not so under-strength as are you, and Bonaparte has executed dragons for treason 
before. What do principles matter to me when I see the shadow of the guillotine hanging upon 
Praecursoris, and where was I to take him? To Russia? He will outlive me by two centuries, and you 
must know how they treat dragons there. I could hardly fly him to America without a transport. My only 
hope was a pardon, and Bonaparte offered it only at a price.” 
“By which you mean Lily,” Laurence said coldly. 
Surprisingly, Choiseul shook his head. “No, his price was not Catherine’s dragon, but yours.” At the 
blank look upon Laurence’s face, he added, “The Chinese egg was sent as a gift for him from the 
Imperial Throne; he meant me to retrieve it. He did not know Temeraire was already hatched.” Choiseul 
shrugged and spread his hands. “I thought perhaps if I killed him—” 
Laurence struck him full across the face, with such force as to knock him onto the stone floor of the cell; 
his chair rocked and fell over with a clatter. Choiseul coughed and blotted blood from his lip, and the 
guard opened the door and looked inside. “Everything all right, sir?” he asked, looking straight at 
Laurence; he paid not the slightest mind to Choiseul’s injury. 
“Yes, you may go,” Laurence said flatly, wiping blood from his hand onto his handkerchief as the door 
closed once again. He would ordinarily have been ashamed to strike a prisoner, but in this moment he 
felt not the slightest qualm; his heart was still beating very quickly. 
Choiseul slowly set his chair back upright and sat down once more. More quietly, he said, “I am sorry. I 
could not bring myself to it, in the end, and I thought instead—” He stopped, seeing the color rise again 
in Laurence’s face. 
The very notion that for all these months such malice had been lurking so close to Temeraire, averted 
only by some momentary quirk of conscience on Choiseul’s part, was enough to make his blood run 
cold. With loathing, he said, “And so instead you tried to seduce a girl barely past her schoolroom years 
and abduct her.” 
Choiseul said nothing; indeed, Laurence could hardly imagine what defense he could have offered. After 
a moment’s pause, Laurence added, “You can have no further pretensions to honor: tell me what 
Bonaparte plans, and perhaps Lenton will have Praecursoris sent to the breeding grounds in 
Newfoundland, if indeed your motive is for his life, and not your own miserable hide.” 
Choiseul paled, but said, “I know very little, but what I know I will tell you, if he gives his word to do as 
much.” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (164 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“No,” Laurence said. “You may speak and hope for a mercy you do not deserve if you choose; I will not 
bargain with you.” 
Choiseul bowed his head, and when he spoke he was broken, so faint Laurence had to strain to hear him. 
“I do not know what he intends, precisely, but he desired me to urge the weakening of the covert here 
most particularly, to have as many sent south to the Mediterranean as could be arranged.” 
Laurence felt sick with dismay; this goal at least had been brilliantly accomplished. “Does he have some 
means for his fleet to escape Cadiz?” he demanded. “Does he suppose he can bring them here without 
facing Nelson?” 
“Do you imagine Bonaparte confided in me?” Choiseul said, not lifting his head. “To him also I was a 
traitor; I was told the tasks I was to accomplish, nothing more.” 
Laurence satisfied himself with a few more questions that Choiseul truly knew nothing else; he left the 
room feeling both soiled and alarmed, and went at once to Lenton. 
  
The news cast a heavy pall upon the whole covert. The captains had not broadcast the details, but even 
the lowliest cadet or crewman could tell that a shadow lay upon them. Choiseul had timed his attempt 
well: the dispatch-rider would not reach them again for six days, and from there two weeks or more 
would be required to see any portion of the forces from the Mediterranean restored to the Channel. 
Militia forces and several Army detachments had already been sent for; they would arrive within a few 
days, to begin emplacing additional artillery along the coastline. 
Laurence, with additional cause for anxiety, had spoken to Granby and Hollin to raise their caution on 
Temeraire’s behalf. If Bonaparte were jealous enough of having so personal a prize taken away, he 
might well send another agent, this one more willing to slay the dragon he could no longer claim. “You 
must promise me to be careful,” he told Temeraire as well. “Eat nothing unless one of us is by, and has 
approved it; and if anyone whom I have not presented to you seeks to approach you, do not under any 
circumstances permit it, even if you must fly to another clearing.” 
“I will have a care, Laurence, I promise,” said Temeraire. “I do not understand, though, why the French 
Emperor should want to have me killed; how could that improve his circumstances? He would do better 
to ask them for another egg.” 
“My dear, the Chinese would hardly condescend to give him a second where the first went so badly 
astray while in the keeping of his own men,” he said. “I am still puzzled at their having given him even 
one, indeed; he must have some prodigiously gifted diplomat at their court. And I suppose his pride may 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (165 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
be hurt, to think that a lowly British captain stands in the place which he had meant to occupy himself.” 
Temeraire snorted with disdain. “I am sure I would never have liked him in the least, even if I had 
hatched in France,” he said. “He sounds a very unpleasant person.” 
“Oh, I cannot truly say. One hears a great deal of his pride, but there is no denying that he is a very great 
man, even if he is a tyrant,” Laurence said reluctantly; he would have been a great deal happier to be 
able to convince himself that Bonaparte was a fool. 
Lenton gave orders that patrols now were to be flown only by half the formation at a time, the rest kept 
back at the covert for intensive combat training. Under cover of night, several additional dragons were 
secretly flown down from the coverts at Edinburgh and Inverness, including Victoriatus, the Parnassian 
whom they had rescued what now seemed a long time ago. His captain, Richard Clark, made a nice 
point of coming to greet Laurence and Temeraire. “I hope you can forgive me for not paying you my 
respects and my gratitude sooner,” he said. “I confess at Laggan I had very little thought for anything 
but his recovery, and we were shipped out again without warning, as I believe were you.” 
Laurence shook his hand heartily. “Pray do not give it a thought,” he said. “I hope he is wholly 
recovered?” 
“Entirely, thank Heaven, and none too soon, either,” Clark said grimly. “I understand the assault is 
expected at any moment.” 
And yet the days stretched out, painfully long with anticipation, and no attack came. Three more 
Winchesters were brought down for additional scouting, but one and all they returned from their 
dangerous forays to the French shores to report heavy patrols at all hours along the enemy’s coastline; 
there was no chance of penetrating far enough inland to acquire more information. 
Levitas was among them, but the company was large enough that Laurence was not obliged to see much 
of Rankin, for which he was grateful. He tried not to see the signs of that neglect which he could do no 
more to cure; he felt he could not visit the little dragon further without provoking a quarrel which might 
be disastrous to the temper of the whole covert. However, he compromised with his conscience so far as 
to say nothing when he saw Hollin coming to Temeraire’s clearing very early the next morning with a 
bucket full of dirty cleaning rags and a guilty expression. 
A great coldness settled over the camp as night came on Sunday, the first week of waiting gone: 
Volatilus had not arrived as expected. The weather had been clear, certainly no cause for delay; it stayed 
so for two further days, and then a third; still he did not come. Laurence tried not to look to the skies, 
and ignored his men doing the same, until that night he found Emily crying quietly outside the clearing, 
having crept away from the barracks for a little privacy. 
She was very ashamed to be caught at it, and pretended there was only some dust in her eyes. Laurence

took her to his rooms and had some cocoa brought; he told her, “I was two years older than you are now 
when I first went to sea, and I blubbered at night for a week.” She looked so very skeptical at this 
account that a laugh was drawn from him. “No, I am not inventing this for your benefit,” he said. “When 
you are a captain, and find one of your own cadets in similar circumstances, I imagine you will tell them 
what I have just told you.” 
“I am not really afraid,” she said, weariness and cocoa having combined to make her drowsy and 
unguarded. “I know Excidium will never let anything happen to Mother, and he is the finest dragon in 
all Europe.” She woke up at having made this slip, and added anxiously, “Temeraire is very nearly as 
good, of course.” 
Laurence nodded gravely. “Temeraire is a great deal younger. Perhaps he will equal Excidium some 
day, when he has more experience.” 
“Yes, just so,” she said, very relieved, and he concealed his smile. Five minutes later she was asleep; he 
laid her on the bed and went to sleep with Temeraire. 
  
“Laurence, Laurence.” He stirred and blinked upwards; Temeraire was nudging him awake urgently, 
though the sky was still dark. Laurence was dimly aware of a low roaring noise, a crowd of voices, and 
then the crack of gunfire. He started up at once: none of his crew were in the clearing, nor his officers. 
“What is it?” Temeraire asked, rising to his feet and unfurling his wings as Laurence climbed down. 
“Are we being attacked? I do not see any dragons aloft.” 
“Sir, sir!” Morgan came running into the clearing, nearly falling over himself in his haste and eagerness. 
“Volly is here, sir, and there has been a great battle, and Napoleon is killed!” 
“Oh, does that mean the war is over already?” Temeraire asked, disappointed. “I have not even been in 
any real battles yet.” 
“Perhaps the news may have grown in the telling; I should be surprised to learn that Bonaparte is truly 
dead,” Laurence said, but he had identified the noise as cheering, and certainly some good news had 
arrived, if not of quite such an absurd caliber. “Morgan, go and rouse Mr. Hollin and the ground crew 
with my apologies for the hour, and ask them to bring Temeraire his breakfast. My dear,” he said, 
turning to Temeraire, “I will go and learn what I can, and return with the news soonest.” 
“Yes, please, and do hurry,” Temeraire said urgently, rearing up on his back legs to see above the trees 
what might be in progress. 
The headquarters was blazing with light; Volly was sitting on the parade grounds before the building 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (167 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
tearing ravenously into a sheep, a couple of groundsmen with the dispatch service keeping off the 
growing crowd of men streaming from the barracks. Several of the young Army and militia officers 
were firing off their guns in their excitement, and Laurence was forced to nearly push his way through to 
reach the doors. 
The doors to Lenton’s office were closed, but Captain James was sitting in the officers’ club, eating with 
scarcely less ferocity than his dragon, and already all the other captains were with him, having the news. 
“Nelson told me to wait; said they’d come out of port before I had time to make another circuit,” James 
was saying, out of the corner of his mouth and somewhat muffled by toast, while Sutton attempted to 
sketch the scene on a piece of paper. “I hardly believed him, but sure enough, by Sunday morning out 
they came, and we met them off Cape Trafalgar early on Monday.” 
He swallowed down a cup of coffee, all the company waiting impatiently for him to finish, and pushed 
his plate aside for a moment to take the paper from Sutton. “Here, let me,” he said, drawing little circles 
to mark the positions of the ships. “Twenty-seven and twelve dragons of ours, against thirty-three and 
ten.” 
“Two columns, breaking their line twice?” Laurence asked, studying the diagram with satisfaction: just 
the sort of strategy to throw the French into disarray, from which their ill-trained crews could hardly 
have recovered. 
“What? Oh, the ships, yes, with Excidium and Laetificat over the weather column, Mortiferus over the 
lee,” James said. “It was hot work at the head of the divisions, I can tell you; I couldn’t see so much as a 
spar from above for the clouds of smoke. At one time I thought for sure Victory had blown up; the 
Spanish had one of those blasted little Flecha-del-Fuegos over there, dashing about quicker than our 
guns could answer. He had all her sails on fire before Laetificat sent him running with his tail between 
his legs.” 
“What were our losses?” Warren asked, his quiet voice cutting through the high spirits of their 
excitement. 
James shook his head. “It was a proper bloodbath and no mistake,” he said somberly. “I suppose we 
have near a thousand men killed; and poor Nelson himself came in a hairsbreadth of it: the fire-breather 
set alight one of Victory’s sails, and it came down upon him where he stood on the quarterdeck. A 
couple of quick-thinking fellows doused him with the scuttlebutt, but they say his medals were melted to 
his skin, and he will wear them all the time, now.” 
“A thousand men; God rest their souls,” Warren said; conversation ceased, and when finally resumed it 
was at first subdued. 
But excitement, joy gradually overcame what perhaps were the more proper sentiments of the moment. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (168 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“I hope you will excuse me, gentlemen,” Laurence said, nearly shouting as the noise climbed to a fresh 
pitch; it precluded any chance of acquiring further intelligence for the moment. “I promised Temeraire 
to return at once. James, I suppose that the report of Bonaparte’s demise is a false one?” 
“Yes, more’s the pity: unless he falls down in an apoplexy over the news,” James called back, which 
roused a general shout of laughter that continued by natural progression into a round of “Hearts of Oak,” 
and the singing followed Laurence out the door and even through the covert, as the song was taken up 
by the men outside. 
  
By the time the sun rose, the covert was half empty. Scarcely a man had slept; the prevailing mood could 
not help but be joyful almost to the point of hysteria, as nerves which had been drawn to their limits 
abruptly relaxed. Lenton did not even attempt to call the men to order and looked the other way as they 
poured out of the covert into the city, to carry the news to those who had not yet heard and mingle their 
voices into the general rejoicing. 
“Whatever scheme of invasion Bonaparte has been working towards, this must surely have put paid to 
it,” Chenery said exultantly, later that evening, as they stood together on the balcony and watched the 
returning crowd still milling more slowly about in the parade grounds below, all the men thoroughly 
drunk but too happy for quarreling, snatches of song bursting out occasionally to float up towards them. 
“How I should like to see his face.” 
“I think we have been giving him too much credit,” Lenton said; his cheeks were red with port and 
satisfaction, as well they might be: his judgment to send Excidium had proven sound and contributed 
materially to the victory. “I think it clear he does not understand the navy so well as the army and the 
aerial corps. An uninformed man might well imagine that thirty-three ships-of-the-line had no excuse to 
lose so thoroughly to twenty-seven.” 
“But how can it have taken his aerial divisions so long to reach them?” Harcourt said. “Only ten 
dragons, and from what James said, more than half of those Spanish—that is not a tenth of the strength 
he had in Austria. Perhaps he has not moved them from the Rhine after all?” 
“I have heard the passes over the Pyrenees are damned difficult, though I have never tried them myself,” 
Chenery said. “But I dare say he never sent them, thinking Villeneuve had what forces he needed, and 
they have all been lolling about in covert and getting fat. No doubt he has been thinking all this time that 
Villeneuve would sail straight through Nelson, perhaps losing one or two ships in the process: expecting 
them daily, and wondering where they were, and we here biting our nails meanwhile for no good 
reason.” 
“And now his army cannot come across,” Harcourt said.

“Quoth Lord St. Vincent, ‘I don’t say they cannot come, but they cannot come by sea,’ ” Chenery said, 
grinning. “And if Bonaparte thinks to take Britain with forty dragons and their crews, he is very 
welcome to try, and we can give him a taste of those guns the militia fellows have been so busily 
digging-in. It would be a pity to waste all their hard work.” 
“I confess I would not mind a chance to give that rascal yet another dose of medicine,” Lenton said. 
“But he will not be so foolish; we must be content with having done our duty, and let the Austrians have 
the glory of polishing him off. His hope of invasion is done.” He swallowed the rest of his port and said 
abruptly, “There is no more putting it off, though, I am afraid; we cannot need anything more from 
Choiseul now.” 
In the silence that fell among them, Harcourt’s drawn breath was almost a sob, but she made no protest, 
and her voice remained admirably steady as she merely asked, “Have you decided what you will do with 
Praecursoris?” 
“We will send him to Newfoundland if he will go; they need another breeding sire there to fill out their 
complement, and it is not as though he were vicious,” Lenton said. “The fault is with Choiseul, not him.” 
He shook his head. “It is a damned pity, of course, and all our beasts will be creeping about miserable 
for days, but there is nothing else for it. Best to get it done with quickly; tomorrow morning.” 
Choiseul was given a few moments with Praecursoris, the big dragon nearly draped with chains and 
watched closely by Maximus and Temeraire on either side. Laurence felt the shudders go through 
Temeraire’s body as they stood their unpleasant guard, forced to observe while Praecursoris swung his 
head from side to side in denial, and Choiseul made a desperate attempt to persuade him to accept the 
shelter Lenton had offered. At last the great head drooped in the barest hint of a nod, and Choiseul 
stepped close to lay his cheek against the smooth nose. 
Then the guards stepped forward; Praecursoris tried to lash at them, but the entangling chains pulled him 
back, and as they led Choiseul away the dragon screamed: a dreadful sound. Temeraire hunched himself 
away from it, his wings flaring, and moaned softly; Laurence leaned forward and stretched himself fully 
against his neck, stroking over and over. “Do not look, my dear,” he said, the words struggling to come 
through the thickening of his throat. “It will be over in a moment.” 
Praecursoris screamed once more, at the end; then he fell to the ground heavily, as if all vital force had 
gone from his body. Lenton signaled that they might go, and Laurence touched Temeraire’s side. 
“Away, away,” he said, and Temeraire launched himself far from the scaffold at once, striking out over 
the clean, empty sea. 
  
“Laurence, may I bring Maximus over here, and Lily?” Berkley asked, in his usual abrupt way, having

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
come upon him without warning. “Your clearing is big enough, I think.” 
Laurence raised his head and stared at him dully. Temeraire was still huddled in misery, head hidden 
beneath his wings, inconsolable: they had flown for hours, just the two of them and the ocean below, 
until Laurence had at last begged him to turn back to land, out of fear that he would become exhausted. 
He himself felt almost bruised and ill, as if feverish. He had attended at hangings before, a grim reality 
of naval life, and Choiseul had been far more deserving of the fate than many a man Laurence had seen 
at the end of a rope; he could not say why he felt such anguish now. 
“If you like,” he said, without enthusiasm, letting his head sink again. He did not look up at the rush of 
wings and shadows as Maximus came over the clearing, his enormous bulk blotting out the sun until he 
landed heavily beside Temeraire; Lily followed after him. They huddled at once around each other and 
Temeraire; after a few moments, Temeraire unwound himself enough to entwine more thoroughly with 
them both, and Lily spread her great wings over them all. 
Berkley led Harcourt over to where Laurence sat leaning against Temeraire’s side, and pushed her 
unresisting to sit beside him; he lowered his stout frame awkwardly to the ground opposite them and 
handed about a dark bottle. Laurence took it and drank without curiosity: strong, unwatered rum, and he 
had not eaten anything all day; it went to his head very quickly, and he was glad for the muffling of all 
sensation. 
Harcourt began to weep after a little while, and Laurence was horrified to find his own face wet even as 
he reached to grip her shoulder. “He was a traitor, nothing but a lying traitor,” Harcourt said, scrubbing 
tears away with the back of her hand. “I am not sorry in the least; I am not sorry at all.” She spoke with 
an effort, as though she were trying to convince herself. 
Berkley handed her the bottle again. “It is not him; damned rotter, deserved it,” he said. “You are sorry 
on account of the dragon, and so are they. They don’t think much of King and country, you know; 
Praecursoris never knew a damned thing about it but where Choiseul told him to go.” 
“Tell me,” Laurence said abruptly, “would Bonaparte have really executed the dragon for treason?” 
“Likely enough; the Continentals do, once in a great while. More to scare the riders off the notion than 
because they blame the beasts,” Berkley said. 
Laurence was sorry to have asked; sorry to know that Choiseul had been telling the truth so far at least. 
“Surely the Corps would have granted him shelter in the colonies, if he had asked,” he said angrily. 
“There is still no possible excuse. He desired his place in France restored; he was willing to risk 
Praecursoris to have it back, for we might just as easily have chosen to put his dragon to death.” 
Berkley shook his head. “Knew we are too hard up for breeders to do as much,” he said. “Not to excuse 
the fellow; I dare say you are right. He thought Bonaparte was going to roll us up, and he did not like to 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (171 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
go and live in the colonies.” Berkley shrugged. “Still damned hard on the dragon, and he has not done 
anything wrong.” 
“That is not true; he has,” Temeraire put in unexpectedly, and they looked up at him; Maximus and Lily 
raised their heads as well to listen. “Choiseul could not have forced him to fly away from France, nor to 
come here bent on hurting us. It does not seem to me that he is any less guilty at all.” 
“I suppose it is likely he did not understand what was being asked of him,” Harcourt said tentatively to 
this challenge. 
Temeraire said, “Then he ought to have refused until he did understand: he is not simple, like Volly. He 
might have saved his rider’s life, then, and his honor too. I would be ashamed to let my rider be 
executed, and not me too, if I had done as much.” He added venomously, his tail lashing the air, “And I 
would not let anyone execute Laurence anyway; I should like to see them try.” 
Maximus and Lily both rumbled in agreement. “I will never let Berkley commit treason, ever,” 
Maximus said, “but if he did, I would step on anyone who tried to hang him.” 
“I would just take Catherine and go away, I think,” Lily said. “But perhaps Praecursoris would have 
liked to do the same. I suppose he could not break all those chains, for he is smaller than either of you, 
and he cannot spray. Also, there was only one of him, and he was being guarded. I do not know what I 
would do, if I could not have escaped.” 
She finished softly, and they all began to slump down in fresh misery, huddling together again, until 
Temeraire stopped and said with sudden decision, “I will tell you what we shall do: if ever you need to 
rescue Catherine, or you Berkley, Maximus, I will help you, and you will do as much for me. Then we 
do not need to worry; I do not suppose anyone could stop all three of us, at least not before we could 
escape.” 
All three of them appeared immeasurably cheered by this excellent scheme; Laurence was now 
regretting the amount of rum he had consumed, for he could not properly form the protest he felt had to 
be made, and urgently. 
“Enough of that, you damned conspirators; you will have us hanged a great deal sooner than we will,” 
Berkley said, thankfully, on his behalf. “Will you have something to eat, now? We are not going to eat 
until you do, and if you are so busy to protect us, you may as well begin by saving us from starvation.” 
“I do not think you are in any danger of starving,” Maximus said. “The surgeon said only two weeks ago 
that you are too fat.” 
“The devil!” Berkley said indignantly, sitting up, and Maximus snorted in amusement at having 
provoked him; but shortly the three dragons did allow themselves to be persuaded to take some food, 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (172 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
and Maximus and Lily returned to their own clearings to be fed. 
“I am still sorry for Praecursoris, even though he acted badly,” Temeraire said presently, having finished 
his meal. “I do not see why they could not let Choiseul go off to the colonies with him.” 
“There must be a price for such things, or else men would do them more often, and in any case he 
deserved to be punished for it,” Laurence said; his own head had cleared with some food and strong 
coffee. “Choiseul meant to make Lily suffer as much as Praecursoris does; only imagine if the French 
had me prisoner, and demanded that you fly for them against your friends and former comrades to save 
my life.” 
“Yes, I do see,” Temeraire said, but with dissatisfaction in his tone. “Yet it still seems to me they might 
have punished him differently. Would it not have been better to keep him a prisoner and force 
Praecursoris to fly for us?” 
“I see you have a nice sense of the appropriate,” Laurence said. “But I do not know that I can see any 
lesser punishment for treason; it is too despicable a crime to be punished by mere imprisonment.” 
“And yet Praecursoris is not to be punished the same way, only because it is not practical, and he is 
needed for breeding?” Temeraire said. 
Laurence considered the matter and could not find an answer for this. “I suppose, in all honesty, being 
aviators ourselves we cannot like the idea of putting a dragon to death, and so we have found an excuse 
for letting him live,” he said finally. “And as our laws are meant for men, perhaps it is not wholly fair to 
enforce them upon him.” 
“Oh, that I can well agree with,” Temeraire said. “Some of the laws which I have heard make very little 
sense, and I do not know that I would obey them if it were not to oblige you. It seems to me that if you 
wish to apply laws to us, it were only reasonable to consult us on them, and from what you have read to 
me about Parliament, I do not think any dragons are invited to go there.” 
“Next you will cry out against taxation without representation, and throw a basket of tea into the 
harbor,” Laurence said. “You are indeed a very Jacobin at heart, and I think I must give up trying to cure 
you of it; I can but wash my hands and deny responsibility.” 
  
Chapter 12

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
BY THE NEXT morning Praecursoris had already gone, sent away to a dragon transport launching from 
Portsmouth for the small covert in Nova Scotia, whence he would be led to Newfoundland, and at last 
immured in the breeding grounds which had lately been started there. Laurence had avoided any further 
sight of the stricken dragon, and deliberately had kept Temeraire awake late the night before, so that he 
would sleep past the moment of departure. 
Lenton had chosen his time as wisely as he could; the general rejoicing over the victory at Trafalgar 
continued, and served to counter the private unhappiness to some extent. That very day a display of 
fireworks was announced by pamphlets, to be held over the mouth of the Thames; and Lily, Temeraire, 
and Maximus, being the youngest of the dragons at the covert and the worst affected, were sent to 
observe by Lenton’s orders. 
Laurence was deeply grateful for the word as the brilliant displays lit the sky and the music from the 
barges drifted to them across the water: Temeraire’s eyes were wide with excitement, the bright bursts of 
color reflecting in his pupils and his scales, and he cocked his head first one way then another, in an 
effort to hear more clearly. He talked of nothing but the music and the explosions and the lights, all the 
way back to the covert. “Is that a concert, then, the sort they have in Dover?” he asked. “Laurence, 
cannot we go again, and perhaps a little closer next time? I could sit very quietly, and I would not 
disturb anyone.” 
“I am afraid fireworks such as those are a special occasion, my dear; concerts are only music,” Laurence 
said, avoiding an answer; he could well imagine the reaction of the city’s inhabitants to a dragon’s 
coming to take in a concert. 
“Oh,” Temeraire said, but he was not greatly dampened. “I would still like that extremely; I could not 
hear very well tonight.” 
“I do not know that there is any suitable accommodation which could be made in the city,” Laurence 
said slowly and reluctantly, but happily a sudden inspiration came to him, and he added, “but perhaps I 
can hire some musicians to come to the covert and play for you, instead; that would be a great deal more 
comfortable, in any case.” 
“Yes, indeed, that would be splendid,” Temeraire said eagerly. He communicated this idea to Maximus 
and Lily as soon as they had all once again landed, and the two of them professed equal interest. 
“Damn you, Laurence, you had much better learn to say no; you will forever be getting us into these 
absurd starts,” Berkley said. “Just see if any musicians will come here, for love or money.” 
“For love, perhaps not; but for a week’s wages and a hearty meal, I am quite certain most musicians 
could be persuaded to play in the heart of Bedlam,” Laurence said.

“It sounds a fine idea to me,” Harcourt said. “I would quite like it myself. I have not been to a concert 
except once when I was sixteen; I had to put on skirts for it, and after only half an hour a dreadful fellow 
sat next to me and whispered impolite remarks until I poured a pot of coffee into his lap. It quite spoiled 
my pleasure, even though he went away straight after.” 
“Christ above, Harcourt, if I ever have reason to offend you, I will make damned sure you have nothing 
hot at hand,” Berkley said; while Laurence struggled between nearly equal portions of dismay: at her 
having been subjected to such insult and at her means of repulsion. 
“Well, I would have struck him, but I would have had to get up. You have no notion how difficult it is to 
arrange skirts when sitting down; it took me five minutes together the first time,” she said reasonably. 
“So I did not want to have it all to do again. Then the waiter came by and I thought that would be easier, 
and anyway more like something a girl ought to do.” 
Still a little pale with the notion, Laurence bade them goodnight, and took Temeraire off to his rest. He 
slept once again in the small tent by his side, even though he thought Temeraire was well over his 
distress, and was rewarded in the morning by being woken early, Temeraire peering into the tent with 
one great eye and inquiring if perhaps Laurence would like to go to Dover and arrange for the concert 
today. 
“I would like to sleep until a civilized hour, but as that is evidently not to be, perhaps I will ask leave of 
Lenton to go,” Laurence said, yawning as he crawled from the tent. “May I have my breakfast first?” 
“Oh, certainly,” Temeraire said, with an air of generosity. 
Muttering a little, Laurence pulled his coat back on and began to walk back to the headquarters. Halfway 
to the building, he nearly collided with Morgan, running to find him. “Sir, Admiral Lenton wants you,” 
the boy said, panting with excitement, when Laurence had steadied him. “And he says, Temeraire is to 
go into combat rig.” 
“Very good,” Laurence said, concealing his surprise. “Go tell Lieutenant Granby and Mr. Hollin at once, 
and then do as Lieutenant Granby tells you; mind you speak of this to no one else.” 
“Yes, sir,” the boy said, and dashed off again to the barracks; Laurence quickened his pace. 
“Come in, Laurence,” Lenton said in reply to his knock; it seemed that every other captain in the covert 
was already crowded into the office as well. To Laurence’s surprise, Rankin was at the front of the 
room, sitting by Lenton’s desk. By wordless agreement, they had managed to avoid speaking to one 
another since Rankin’s transfer from Loch Laggan, and Laurence had known nothing of his and 
Levitas’s activities. These had evidently been more dangerous than Laurence might have imagined: a 
bandage around Rankin’s thigh was visibly stained with blood, and his clothes also; his thin face was 
pale and set with pain. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (175 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Lenton waited only until the door had closed behind the last few stragglers to begin; he said grimly, “I 
dare say you already realize, gentlemen: we have been celebrating too soon. Captain Rankin has just 
returned from a flight over the coast; he was able to slip past their borders, and caught a look at what 
that damned Corsican has been working on. You may see for yourselves.” 
He pushed across his desk a sheet of paper, smudged with dirt and bloodstains that did not obscure an 
elegantly drafted diagram in Rankin’s precise hand. Laurence frowned, trying to puzzle the thing out: it 
looked rather like a ship-of-the-line, but with no railings at all around her upper deck, and no masts 
shipped, with strange thick beams protruding from both sides fore and aft, and no gunports. 
“What is it for?” Chenery said, turning it around. “I thought he already had boats?” 
“Perhaps it will become clearer if I explain that he had dragons carrying them about over the ground,” 
Rankin said. Laurence understood at once: the beams were intended to give the dragons a place to hold; 
Napoleon meant to fly his troops over the Navy’s guns entirely, while so many of Britain’s aerial forces 
were occupied at the Mediterranean. 
Lenton said, “We are not certain how many men he will have in each—” 
“Sir, I beg your pardon; may I ask, how long are these vessels?” Laurence asked, interrupting. “And is 
this to scale?” 
“To my eye, yes,” Rankin said. “The one which I saw in mid-air had two Reapers to a side, and room to 
spare; perhaps two hundred feet from front to back.” 
“They will be three-deckers inside, then,” Laurence said grimly. “If they sling hammocks, he can fit as 
many as two thousand men apiece, for a short journey, if he means to carry no provisions.” 
A murmur of alarm went around the room. Lenton said, “Less than two hours to cross each way, even if 
they launch from Cherbourg, and he has sixty dragons or more.” 
“He could land fifty thousand men by midmorning, good God,” said one of the captains Laurence did 
not know, a man who had arrived only recently; the same calculation was running in all their heads. It 
was impossible not to look about the room and tally their own side: less than twenty men, a good quarter 
of whom were the scout and courier captains whose beasts could do very little in combat. 
“But surely the things must be hopeless to manage in the air, and can the dragons carry such a weight?” 
Sutton asked, studying the design further. 
“Likely he has built them from light wood; he only needs them to last a day, after all, and they need not 
be watertight,” Laurence said. “He needs only an easterly wind to carry him over; with that narrow 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (176 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
framing they will offer very little resistance. But they will be vulnerable in the air, and surely Excidium 
and Mortiferus are already on their way back?” 
“Four days away, at best, and Bonaparte must know that as well as do we,” Lenton said. “He has spent 
nearly his entire fleet and the Spanish as well to buy himself freedom from their presence; he is not 
going to waste the chance.” The obvious truth of this was felt at once; a grim and expectant silence fell 
upon the room. Lenton looked down at his desk, then stood up, uncharacteristically slow; Laurence for 
the first time noticed that his hair was grey and thin. 
“Gentlemen,” Lenton said formally, “the wind is in the north today, so we may have a little grace if he 
chooses to wait for a better wind. All of our scouts will be flying in shifts just off Cherbourg; we will 
have an hour’s warning at least. I do not need to tell you we will be hopelessly outnumbered; we can 
only do our best, and delay if we cannot prevent.” 
No one spoke, and after a moment he said, “We will need every heavy- and middleweight beast on 
independent duty; your task will be to destroy these transports. Chenery, Warren, the two of you will 
take midwing positions in Lily’s formation, and two of our scouts will take the wing-tip positions. 
Captain Harcourt, undoubtedly Bonaparte will reserve some dragons for defense; your task is to keep 
those defenders occupied as best you can.” 
“Yes, sir,” she said; the others nodded. 
Lenton took a deep breath and rubbed his face. “There is nothing else to be said, gentlemen; go to your 
preparations.” 
  
There was no sense in keeping it from the men; the French had nearly caught Rankin on his way back 
and already knew that their secret at last was out. Laurence quietly told his lieutenants, then sent them 
about their work; he could see the passage of the news through the ranks: men leaning in to hear from 
one another, their faces hardening as they grasped the situation, and the ordinary idle conversation of a 
morning vanishing quite away. He was proud to see even the youngest officers take it with great courage 
and go straight back to their work. 
This was the first time Temeraire would ever use the complete accoutrements of heavy combat outside 
of practice; for patrol a much lighter set of gear was used, and their previous engagement had been under 
traveling harness. Temeraire stood very straight and still, only his head turned about so he could watch 
with great excitement as the men rigged him out with the heaviest leather harness, triple-riveted, and 
began hooking in the enormous panels of chain-mesh that would serve as armor. 
Laurence began his own inspection of the equipment and belatedly realized that Hollin was nowhere to 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (177 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
be seen; he looked three times through the whole clearing before he quite believed the man’s absence, 
and then called the armorer Pratt away from his work on the great protective plates which would shield 
Temeraire’s breast and shoulders during the fighting. “Where is Mr. Hollin?” he asked. 
“Why, I don’t believe I’ve seen him this morning, sir,” Pratt said, scratching his head. “He was in last 
night, though.” 
“Very good,” Laurence said, and dismissed him. “Roland, Dyer, Morgan,” he called, and when the three 
runners came, he said, “Go and see if you can find Mr. Hollin, and then tell him I expect him here at 
once, if you please.” 
“Yes, sir,” they said almost in unison, and dashed off in different directions after a hurried consultation. 
He returned to watching the men work, a deep frown on his face; he was astonished and dismayed to 
find the man failing in his duty at all, and under these circumstances most particularly; he wondered if 
Hollin could have fallen ill and gone to the surgeons: it seemed the only excuse, but the man would 
surely have told one of his crewmates. 
More than an hour went by, and Temeraire was in full rig with the crew practicing boarding maneuvers 
under Lieutenant Granby’s severe eye, before young Roland came hurrying back to the clearing. “Sir,” 
she said, panting and unhappy. “Sir, Mr. Hollin is with Levitas, please do not be angry,” she said, all in 
one rushing breath. 
“Ah,” Laurence said, a little embarrassed; he could hardly admit to Roland that he had been turning a 
blind eye to Hollin’s visits, so she naturally was reluctant to be a tale-bearer on a fellow aviator. “He 
will have to answer for it, but that can wait; go and tell him he is needed at once.” 
“Sir, I told him so, but he said he cannot leave Levitas, and he told me to go away at once, and to tell 
you that he begs you to come, if only you can,” she said, very quickly, and eyeing him nervously to see 
how he would take this insubordination. 
Laurence stared; he could not account for the extraordinary response, but after a moment, his estimate of 
Hollin’s character decided him. “Mr. Granby,” he called, “I must go for a moment; I leave things in your 
hands. Roland, stay here and come fetch me at once if anything occurs,” he told her. 
He walked quickly, torn between temper and concern, and reluctance to once again expose himself to a 
complaint from Rankin, particularly under the circumstances. No one could deny the man had done his 
duty bravely, just now, and to offer him insult directly after would be an extraordinary piece of rudeness. 
And at the same time, Laurence could not help but grow angry at the man as he followed Roland’s 
directions: Levitas’s clearing was one of the small ones nearest the headquarters, undoubtedly chosen for 
Rankin’s convenience rather than his dragon’s; the grounds were poorly tended, and when Levitas came 
into view, Laurence saw he was lying in a circle of bare sandy dirt, with his head in Hollin’s lap. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (178 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“Well, Mr. Hollin, what’s all this?” Laurence said, irritation making his tone sharp; then he came around 
and saw the great expanse of bandages that covered Levitas’s flank and belly, hidden from the other 
side, and already soaked through with the near-black blood. “My God,” he said involuntarily. 
Levitas’s eyes opened a little at the sound and turned up to look at him hopefully; they were glazed and 
bright with pain, but after a moment recognition came into them, and the little dragon sighed and closed 
them again, without a word. 
“Sir,” Hollin said, “I’m sorry, I know I’ve my duty, but I couldn’t leave him. The surgeon’s gone; says 
there’s nothing more to be done for him, and it won’t be long. There is no one here at all, not even to 
send for some water.” He stopped, and said again, “I couldn’t leave him.” 
Laurence knelt beside him and put his hand on Levitas’s head, very lightly for fear of causing him more 
pain. “No,” he said. “Of course not.” 
He was glad now to find himself so close to the headquarters. There were some crewmen idling by the 
door talking of the news, so he could send them to Hollin’s assistance, and Rankin was in the officers’ 
club, easily found. He was drinking wine, his color already greatly improved and having shifted his 
bloodstained clothing for fresh; Lenton and a couple of the scout captains were sitting with him and 
discussing positions to hold along the coastline. 
Coming up to him, Laurence told him very quietly, “If you can walk, get on your feet; otherwise I will 
carry you.” 
Rankin put down his glass and stared at him coldly. “I beg your pardon?” he said. “I gather this is some 
more of your officious—” 
Laurence paid no attention, but seized the back of his chair and heaved. Rankin fell forward, scrabbling 
to catch himself on the floor; Laurence took him by the scruff of his coat and dragged him up to his feet, 
ignoring his gasp of pain. 
“Laurence, what in God’s name—” Lenton said in astonishment, rising to his feet. 
“Levitas is dying; Captain Rankin wishes to make his farewells,” Laurence said, looking Lenton 
squarely in the eye and holding Rankin up by the collar and the arm. “He begs to be excused.” 
The other captains stared, half out of their chairs. Lenton looked at Rankin, then very deliberately sat 
back down again. “Very good,” he said, and reached for the bottle; the other captains slowly sank back 
down as well. 
Rankin stumbled along in his grip, not even trying to free himself, shrinking a little from Laurence as

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
they went; outside the clearing, Laurence stopped and faced him. “You will be generous to him, do you 
understand me?” he said. “You will give him every word of praise he has earned from you and never 
received; you will tell him he has been brave, and loyal, and a better partner than you have deserved.” 
Rankin said nothing, only stared as if Laurence were a dangerous lunatic; Laurence shook him again. 
“By God, you will do all this and more, and hope that it is enough to satisfy me,” he said savagely, and 
dragged him on. 
Hollin was still sitting with Levitas’s head in his lap, a bucket now beside him; he was squeezing water 
from a clean cloth into the dragon’s open mouth. He looked at Rankin without bothering to hide his 
contempt, but then he bent over and said, “Levitas, come along now; look who’s come.” 
Levitas’s eyes opened, but they were milky and blind. “My captain?” he said uncertainly. 
Laurence thrust Rankin forward and down onto his knees, none too gently; Rankin gasped and clutched 
at his thigh, but he said, “Yes, I am here.” He looked up at Laurence and swallowed, then added 
awkwardly, “You have been very brave.” 
There was nothing natural or sincere in the tone; it was as ungraceful as could be imagined. But Levitas 
only said, very softly, “You came.” He licked at a few drops of water at the corner of his mouth. The 
blood was still welling sluggishly from beneath the dressing, thick enough to slightly part the bandages 
one from the other, glistening and black. Rankin shifted uneasily; his breeches and stockings were being 
soaked through, but he looked up at Laurence and did not try to move away. 
Levitas gave a low sigh, and then the shallow movement of his sides ceased. Hollin closed his eyes with 
one rough hand. 
Laurence’s hand was still heavy on the back of Rankin’s neck; now he lifted it away, rage gone, and 
only tight-lipped disgust left. “Go,” he said. “We who valued him will make the arrangements, not you.” 
He did not even look at the man as Rankin left the clearing. “I cannot stay,” he said quietly to Hollin. 
“Can you manage?” 
“Yes,” Hollin said, stroking the little head. “There can’t be anything, with the battle coming and all, but 
I’ll see he’s taken and buried proper. Thank you, sir; it meant a great deal to him.” 
“More than it ought,” Laurence said. He stood looking down at Levitas a short while longer; then he 
went back to the headquarters and found Admiral Lenton. 
“Well?” Lenton asked, scowling, as Laurence was shown into his office. 
“Sir, I apologize for my behavior,” Laurence said. “I am happy to bear any consequences you should 
think appropriate.”

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“No, no, what are you talking about? I mean Levitas,” Lenton said impatiently. 
Laurence paused, then said, “Dead, with a great deal of pain, but he went easily at the end.” 
Lenton shook his head. “Damned pity,” he said, pouring a glass of brandy for Laurence and himself. He 
finished his own glass in two great swallows and sighed heavily. “And a wretched time for Rankin to 
become unharnessed,” he said. “We have a Winchester hatching unexpectedly at Chatham: any day now, 
by the hardening of the shell. I have been scrambling to find a fellow in range worthy of the position and 
willing to be put to a Winchester; now here he is on the loose and having made himself a hero bringing 
us this news. If I don’t send him and the beast ends up unharnessed, we will have a yowl from his entire 
damned family, and a question taken up in Parliament, like as not.” 
“I would rather see a dragon dead than in his hands,” Laurence said, setting down his glass hard. “Sir, if 
you want a man who will be a credit to the service, send Mr. Hollin; I would vouch with my life for 
him.” 
“What, your ground-crew master?” Lenton frowned at him, but thoughtfully. “That is a thought, if you 
think him suited for the task; he could not feel he was hurting his career by such a step. Not a gentleman, 
I suppose.” 
“No, sir, unless by gentleman you mean a man of honor rather than breeding,” Laurence said. 
Lenton snorted at this. “Well, we are not so stiff-necked a lot we must pay that a great deal of mind,” he 
said. “I dare say it will answer nicely; if we are not all dead or captured by the time the egg cracks, at 
any rate.” 
  
Hollin stared when Laurence relieved him of his duties, and said a little helplessly, “My own dragon?” 
He had to turn away and hide his face; Laurence pretended not to see. “Sir, I don’t know how to thank 
you,” he said, whispering to keep his voice from breaking. 
“I have promised you will be a credit to the service; see to it you do not make me a liar, and I will be 
content,” Laurence said, and shook his hand. “You must go at once; the hatching is expected at almost 
any day, and there is a carriage waiting to take you to Chatham.” 
Looking dazed, Hollin accepted Laurence’s hand, and the bag with his few possessions which his 
fellows on the ground crew had hastily packed for him, then allowed himself to be led off towards the 
waiting carriage by young Dyer. The crew were beaming upon him as they went; he was obliged to 
shake a great many hands, until Laurence, fearing he would never get under way, said, “Gentlemen, the

wind is still in the north; let us get some of this armor off Temeraire for the night,” and put them to 
work. 
Temeraire watched him go a little sadly. “I am very glad that the new dragon will have him instead of 
Rankin, but I wish they had given him to Levitas sooner, and perhaps Hollin would have kept him from 
dying,” he said to Laurence, as the crew worked on him. 
“We cannot know what would have happened,” Laurence said. “But I am not certain Levitas could ever 
have been happy with such an exchange; even at the end he only wanted Rankin’s affection, as strange 
as that seems to us.” 
Laurence slept with Temeraire again that evening, close and sheltered in his arms and wrapped in 
several woolen blankets against the early frost. He woke just before first light to see the barren tree-tops 
bending away from the sunrise: an easterly wind, blowing from France. 
“Temeraire,” he called quietly, and the great head rose up above him to sniff the air. 
“The wind has changed,” Temeraire said, and bent down to nuzzle him. 
Laurence allowed himself the indulgence of five minutes, lying warm and embraced, with his hands 
resting on the narrow, tender scales of Temeraire’s nose. “I hope I have never given you cause for 
unhappiness, my dear,” he said softly. 
“Never, Laurence,” Temeraire said, very low. 
The ground crew came hurrying from the barracks the moment he touched the bell. The chain-mesh had 
been left in the clearing, under a cloth, and Temeraire had slept in the heavy harness for this once. He 
was quickly fitted out, while at the other side of the clearing Granby reviewed every man’s harness and 
carabiners. Laurence submitted to his inspection as well, then took a moment to clean and reload his 
pistols fresh, and belt on his sword. 
The sky was cold and white, a few darker grey clouds scudding like shadows. No orders had come yet. 
At Laurence’s request, Temeraire lifted him up to his shoulder and reared onto his hind legs; he could 
see the dark line of the ocean past the trees, and the ships bobbing in the harbor. The wind came strongly 
into his face, cold and salt. “Thank you, Temeraire,” he said, and Temeraire set him down again. “Mr. 
Granby, we will get the crew aboard,” Laurence said. 
The ground crew put up a great noise, more a roar than a cheer, as Temeraire rose into the air; Laurence 
could hear it echoed throughout the covert as the other great beasts beat up into the sky. Maximus was a 
great blazing presence in his red-gold brilliance, dwarfing the others; Victoriatus and Lily also stood out 
against the crowd of smaller Yellow Reapers. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (182 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Lenton’s flag was streaming from his dragon Obversaria, the golden Anglewing; she was only a little 
larger than the Reapers, but she cut through the crowd of dragons and took the lead with effortless grace, 
her wings rotating almost as did Temeraire’s. As the larger dragons had been set on independent duty, 
Temeraire did not need to keep to the formation’s speed; he quickly negotiated a position near the 
leading edge of the force. 
The wind was in their faces, cold and damp, and the low whistling shriek of their passage carried away 
all noise, leaving only the leathery snap of Temeraire’s wings, each beat like a sail going taut, and the 
creaking of the harness. Nothing else broke the unnatural, heavy silence of the crew. They were already 
drawn in sight: at this distance the French dragons seemed a cloud of gulls or sparrows, so many were 
they, and wheeling so in unison. 
The French were keeping at a considerable height, some nine hundred feet above the surface of the 
water, well out of range of even the longest pepper guns. Below them, a lovely and futile spread of white 
sail: the Channel Fleet, many of the ships wreathed in smoke where they had tried a hopeless shot. More 
of the ships had taken up positions nearer the land, despite the terrible danger of placing themselves so 
close to a leeward shore; if the French could be forced to land very near the edge of the cliffs, they might 
yet come into range of the long guns, if briefly. 
Excidium and Mortiferus were racing back from Trafalgar at frantic speed with their formations, but 
they could not hope to arrive before the end of the week. There was not a man among them but had 
known to a nicety the numbers which the French could muster against them. Rationally, there had never 
been any cause for hope. 
Even so, it was a different thing to see those numbers made flesh and wing: fully twelve of the light 
wooden transports which Rankin had spied out, each carried by four dragons, and defended by as many 
more besides. Laurence had never heard of such a force in modern warfare; it was the stuff of the 
Crusades, when dragons had been smaller and the country more wild, the more easily to feed them. 
This occurring to him, Laurence turned to Granby and said calmly, loud enough to carry back to the 
men, “The logistics of feeding so many dragons together must be impractical for any extended period; 
he will not be able to try this again soon.” 
Granby only stared at him a moment, then with a start he said hurriedly, “Just so; right you are. Should 
we give the men a little exercise? I think we have at least half an hour’s grace before we meet them.” 
“Very good,” Laurence said, pushing himself up to his feet; the force of the wind was great, but braced 
against his straps he was able to turn around. The men did not quite like to meet his eyes, but there was 
an effect: backs straightened, whispers stopped; none of them cared to show fear or reluctance to his 
face. 
“Mr. Johns, exchange of positions, if you please,” Granby called through his speaking-trumpet; shortly 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (183 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
the topmen and bellmen had run through their exchange under the direction of their lieutenants, and the 
men were warmed up against the biting wind; their faces looked a little less pinched. They could not 
engage in true gunnery-practice with the other crews so close, but with a commendable show of energy, 
Lieutenant Riggs had his riflemen fire blanks to loosen their fingers. Dunne had long, thin hands, at 
present bled white with cold; as he struggled to reload, his powder-horn slipped out of his fingers and 
nearly went over the side. Collins only saved it by leaning nearly straight out from Temeraire’s back, 
just barely catching the cord. 
Temeraire glanced back once as the shots went off, but straightened himself again without any reminder. 
He was flying easily, at a pace which he could have sustained for the better part of a day; his breathing 
was not labored or even much quickened. His only difficulty was an excess of high spirits: as the French 
dragons came more closely into view, he succumbed to excitement and put on a burst of speed; but at 
the touch of Laurence’s hand, he drew back again into the line. 
The French defenders had formed into a loosely woven line-of-battle, the larger dragons above, with the 
smaller ones beneath in a darting unpredictable mass, forming a wall shielding the transport vessels and 
their carriers. Laurence felt if only they could break through the line, there might be some hope. The 
carriers, most of them of the middle-weight Pêcheur-Rayé breed, were laboring greatly: the 
unaccustomed weight was telling on them, and he was sure they would be vulnerable to an attack. 
But they had twenty-three dragons to the French forty-and-more defenders, and almost a quarter of the 
British force was made up of Greylings and Winchesters, no proper match for the combat-weight 
dragons. Getting through the line would be nearly impossible; and once through, any attacker would 
immediately be isolated and vulnerable in turn. 
On Obversaria, Lenton sent up the flags for attack: Engage the enemy more closely. Laurence felt his 
own heart begin beating faster, with the tremble of excitement that would fade only after the first 
moments of battle. He raised the speaking-trumpet and called forward, “Choose your target, Temeraire; 
if ever you can get us alongside a transport, you cannot do wrong.” In the confusion of the enormous 
crowd of dragons, he trusted Temeraire’s instincts better than his own; if there was a gap in the French 
line, Laurence was sure that Temeraire would see it. 
By way of answer, Temeraire struck out immediately for one of the outlying transports, as if he meant to 
go straight at it; abruptly he folded his wings and dived, and the three French dragons who had closed 
ranks in front of him dashed in pursuit. Swiveling his wings, Temeraire halted himself in mid-air while 
the three went flashing past; with a few mighty wing-strokes he was now flying directly up towards the 
unprotected belly of the first carrier on the larboard side, and now Laurence could see that this dragon, a 
smaller female Pêcheur-Rayé, was visibly tired: her wings laboring, even though her pace was still 
regular. 
“Ready bombs,” Laurence shouted. As Temeraire came hurtling past the Pêcheur-Rayé and slashed at 
the French dragon’s side, the crew hurled the bombs onto the deck of the transport. The crack of gunfire 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (184 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
came from the Pêcheur’s back, and Laurence heard a cry behind him: Collins threw up his arms and 
went limp in his harness, his rifle tumbling away into the water below. A moment later the body 
followed: he was dead, and one of the others had cut him loose. 
There were no guns on the transport itself, but the deck was built slanting like a roof: three of the bombs 
rolled off before they could burst, drifting smoke as they fell uselessly. However, two exploded in time: 
the whole transport sagged in mid-air as the shock briefly threw the Pêcheur off her pace, gaping holes 
torn in the wooden planking. Laurence caught a single glimpse of a pale, staring face inside, smudged 
with dirt and inhuman with terror; then Temeraire was angling away. 
Blood was dripping from somewhere below, a thin black stream; Laurence leaned to check, but saw no 
injury; Temeraire was flying well. “Granby,” he shouted, pointing. 
“From his claws—the other beast,” Granby shouted back, after a moment, and Laurence nodded. 
But there was no opportunity for a second pass: two more French dragons were coming at them directly. 
Temeraire beat up quickly into the sky, the enemy beasts following; they had seen his trick of 
maneuvering and were coming at a more cautious pace so as not to overrun him. 
“Double back, straight down and at them,” Laurence called to Temeraire. 
“Guns ready,” Riggs shouted behind him, as Temeraire drew a deep, swelling breath and neatly turned 
back on himself in mid-air. No longer at war with gravity, he plummeted towards the French dragons, 
roaring furiously. The tremendous volume rattled Laurence’s bones even in the face of the wind; the 
dragon in the lead recoiled, shrieking, and entangled the head of the second in its wings. 
Temeraire flew straight down between them, through the bitter smoke of the enemy gunfire, the British 
rifles speaking in answer; several of the enemy dead were already cut loose and falling. Temeraire 
lashed out and carved a gash along the second dragon’s flank as they went past; the spurting blood 
splashed Laurence’s trousers, fever-hot against his skin. 
They were away, and the two attackers were still struggling to right themselves: the first was flying very 
badly and making shrill noises of pain. Even as Laurence glanced behind them he saw the dragon being 
turned back for France: with their advantage in numbers, Bonaparte’s aviators had no need to push their 
dragons past injury. 
“Bravely done,” Laurence called, unable to keep jubilation, pride out of his voice, as absurd as it was to 
indulge in such sentiments at the height of so desperate a battle. Behind him, the crew cheered wildly as 
the second of the French dragons pulled away to find another opponent, not daring to attempt Temeraire 
alone. At once Temeraire was winging back towards their original target, head raised proudly: he was 
still unmarked. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (185 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Their formation-partner Messoria was at the transport: thirty years of experience made her and Sutton 
wily, and they too had won past the line-of-battle, to continue the attack on the already-weakened 
Pêcheur whom Temeraire had injured. A pair of the smaller Poux-de-Ciel were defending the Pêcheur; 
together they were more than Messoria’s weight, but she was making use of every trick she had, 
skillfully baiting them forward, trying to make an opening for a dash at the Pêcheur. More smoke was 
pouring from the transport’s deck: Sutton’s crew had evidently managed to land a few more bombs upon 
it. 
Flank to larboard, Sutton signaled from Messoria’s back as they approached. Messoria made a dash at 
the two defenders to keep their attention on her, while Temeraire swept forward and lashed at the 
Pêcheur’s side, his claws tearing through the chain-mesh with a hideous noise; dark blood spurted. 
Bellowing, instinctively trying to lash out at Temeraire in defense, the Pêcheur let go the beam with one 
foreleg; it was secured to the dragon’s body by many heavy chains, but even so the transport listed 
visibly down, and Laurence could hear the men inside yelling. 
Temeraire made an ungraceful but effective fluttering hop and avoided the strike, still closely engaged; 
he tore away more of the chain-mesh and clawed the Pêcheur again. “Prepare volley,” Riggs bellowed, 
and the riflemen strafed the Pêcheur’s back cruelly. Laurence saw one of the French officers taking aim 
at Temeraire’s head; he fired his own pistols, and with the second shot, the man went down clutching his 
leg. 
“Sir, permission to board,” Granby called forward. The Pêcheur’s topmen and riflemen had suffered 
heavy losses; its back was largely cleared, and the opportunity was ideal; Granby was standing at the 
ready with a dozen of the men, all of them with swords drawn and hands ready to unlock their 
carabiners. 
Laurence had been dreading this possibility of all things; it was only with deep reluctance that he gave 
Temeraire the word and laid them alongside the French dragon. “Boarders away,” he shouted, waving 
Granby his permission with a low, sinking feeling in his belly; nothing could have been more unpleasant 
than to watch his men make that terrifying unharnessed leap into the waiting enemy’s hands, while he 
himself had to remain at his station. 
A terrible ululating cry in the near distance: Lily had just struck a French dragon full in the face, and it 
was scrabbling and clawing at its own face, jerking in one direction and then the next, frenzied with the 
pain. Temeraire’s shoulders hunched with sympathy just as the Pêcheur’s did; Laurence flinched himself 
from the intolerable sound. Then the screaming stopped, abruptly; a sickening relief: the captain had 
crept out along the neck and put a bullet into his own dragon’s head rather than see the creature die 
slowly as the acid ate through the skull and into the brain. Many of his crew had leapt to other dragons 
for safety, some even to Lily’s back, but he had sacrificed the opportunity; Laurence saw him falling 
alongside the tumbling dragon, and they plunged into the ocean together. 
He wrenched himself from the horrible fascination of the sight; the bloody struggle aboard the Pêcheur’s 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (186 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
back was going well for them, and he could already see a couple of the midwingmen working on the 
chains that secured the transport to the dragon. But the Pêcheur’s distress had not gone unnoticed: 
another French dragon was coming towards them at speed, and some exceptionally daring men were 
climbing out of the holes in the damaged transport, trying to make their way up the chains to the 
Pêcheur’s back to provide assistance. Even as Laurence caught sight of them, a couple of them slipped 
on the sloping deck and fell; but there were more than a dozen making the attempt, and if they were to 
reach the Pêcheur, they would certainly turn the tide of battle against Granby and the boarders. 
Messoria cried out then, a long shrill wail. “Fall back,” Laurence heard Sutton shouting. She was 
streaming dark blood from a deep cut across her breastbone, another wound on her flank already being 
packed with white bandage; she dropped and wheeled away, leaving the two Poux-de-Ciel who had been 
attacking her at liberty. Though they were much smaller than Temeraire, he could not engage the 
Pêcheur while under attack from two directions: Laurence had either to call back the boarding party, or 
abandon them and hope they could take the Pêcheur, securing its surrender by seizing its captain alive. 
“Granby!” Laurence shouted; the lieutenant looked around, wiping blood from a cut on his face, and 
nodded as soon as he saw their position, waving them off. Laurence touched Temeraire’s side and called 
to him; with a last parting slash across the Pêcheur’s flank that laid white bone bare, Temeraire spun 
away, gaining some distance, and hovered to permit them to survey. The two smaller French dragons did 
not pursue, but remained hovering close to the Pêcheur; they did not dare try to get close enough to send 
men over, for Temeraire could easily overwhelm them if they put themselves in so exposed a position. 
Yet Temeraire himself was also in some danger. The riflemen and half the bellmen had gone for the 
boarding party; well worth the risk, for if they took the Pêcheur, the transport could not very well 
continue on; if it did not fall entirely, at least the three remaining dragons would likely be forced to turn 
back for France. But that meant Temeraire was now undermanned, and they were vulnerable to boarding 
themselves: they could not risk another close engagement. 
The boarding party was making steady progress now against the last men resisting aboard the Pêcheur’s 
back; they would certainly outdistance the men from the transport. One of the Poux-de-Ciel dashed in 
and tried to lie alongside the Pêcheur; “At them,” Laurence called, and Temeraire dived instantly, his 
raking claws and teeth sending the smaller beast into a hurried retreat. Laurence had to send Temeraire 
winging away again, but it had been enough. The French had lost their chance, and the Pêcheur was 
crying out in alarm, twisting her head around: Granby was standing at the French dragon’s neck with a 
pistol aimed at a man’s head—they had taken the captain. 
At Granby’s order, the chains were flung off the Pêcheur, and they turned the captured French dragon’s 
head towards Dover. She flew unwillingly and slowly, head turning back every few moments in anxiety 
for her captain; but she went, and the transport was left hanging wildly askew, the three remaining 
dragons struggling desperately under its weight. 
Laurence had little opportunity to enjoy the triumph: two fresh dragons came diving at them: a Petit 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (187 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Chevalier considerably larger than Temeraire despite the name, and a middleweight Pêcheur-Couronné 
who dashed to seize the sagging support beam. The men still clinging to the roof threw the dangling 
chains to the fresh dragon’s crew, and in moments the transport was righted and under way again. 
The Poux-de-Ciel were coming at them again from opposite sides, and the Petit Chevalier was angling 
round from behind: their position was exposed, and growing rapidly hopeless. “Withdraw, Temeraire,” 
Laurence called, bitter though the order was to give. Temeraire turned away at once, but the pursuing 
dragons drew nearer; he had been fighting hard now for nearly half an hour, and he was tiring. 
The two Poux-de-Ciel were working in concert, trying to herd Temeraire towards the big dragon, darting 
across his path of flight to slow him. The Petit Chevalier suddenly put on a burst of speed, and as he 
drew alongside them a handful of men leapt over. “ ’Ware boarders,” Lieutenant Johns shouted in his 
hoarse baritone, and Temeraire looked round in alarm. Fear gave him fresh energy to draw away from 
the pursuit; the Chevalier fell behind, and after Temeraire lashed out and caught one of the Poux-de-
Ciel, they too abandoned the chase. 
However, there were eight men already crossed over and latched on; Laurence grimly reloaded his 
pistols, thrusting them into his belt, then lengthened his carabiner straps and stood. The five topmen 
under Lieutenant Johns were trying to hold the boarders at the middle of Temeraire’s back. Laurence 
made his way back as quickly as he dared. His first shot went wide, his second took a Frenchman 
directly in the chest; the man fell coughing blood and dangled limply from the harness. 
Then it was hot, frantic sword-work, with the sky whipping past too quickly to see anything but the men 
before him. A French lieutenant was standing in front of him; the man saw his gold bars and aimed a 
pistol at him; Laurence barely heard the speech the man tried to make him, and paid no attention, but 
knocked the gun away with his sword-arm and clubbed the Frenchman on the temple with his pistol-
butt. The lieutenant fell; the man behind him lunged, but the wind of their passage was against him, and 
the sword-thrust scarcely penetrated the leather coat Laurence wore. 
Laurence cut the man’s harness-straps and kicked him off with a boot to the middle, then looked around 
for more boarders; but by good fortune the others were all dead or disarmed, and for their part only 
Challoner and Wright had fallen, except for Lieutenant Johns, who was hanging from his carabiners, 
blood welling up furiously from a pistol-wound in his chest; before they could try to tend him, he gave a 
final rattling gasp and also was still. 
Laurence bent down and closed Johns’s dead, staring eyes, and hung his own sword back on his belt. 
“Mr. Martin, take command of the top, acting lieutenant. Get these bodies cleared away.” 
“Yes, sir,” Martin said, panting; there was a bloody gash across his cheek, and red splashes of blood in 
his yellow hair. “Is your arm all right, Captain?” 
Laurence looked; blood was seeping a little through the rent in the coat, but he could move the arm

easily, and he felt no weakness. “Only a scratch; I will tie it up directly.” 
He clambered over a body and back to his station at the neck and latched himself in tight, then pulled 
loose his neckcloth to wrap around the wound. “Boarders repelled,” he called, and the nervous tension 
left Temeraire’s shoulders. Temeraire had drawn away from the battlefield, as proper when boarded; 
now he turned back around, and when Laurence looked up he could see the whole extent of the field of 
battle, where it was not obscured by smoke and dragon wings. 
All but three of the transports were under no sort of attack at all: the British dragons were being heavily 
engaged by the French defenders. Lily was flying virtually alone; only Nitidus remained with her, the 
others of their formation nowhere in Laurence’s sight. He looked for Maximus and saw him engaged 
closely with their old enemy, the Grand Chevalier; the intervening two months of growth had brought 
Maximus closer to his size, and the two of them were tearing at each other in a terrible savagery. 
At this distance the sound of the battle was muffled; instead he could hear a more fatal one entirely: the 
crash of the waves, breaking upon the foot of the white cliffs. They had been driven nearly to shore, and 
he could see the red-and-white coats of the soldiers formed up on the ground. It was not yet midday. 
Abruptly a phalanx of six heavy-weight dragons broke off from the French line and dived towards the 
ground, all of them roaring at the top of their lungs while their crews threw bombs down. The thin ranks 
of redcoats wavered as in a breeze, and the mass of militia in the center almost broke, men falling to 
their knees and covering their heads, though scarcely any real damage was done. A dozen guns were 
fired off, wildly: shots wasted, Laurence thought in despair, and the leading transport could make its 
descent almost unmolested. 
The four carriers drew closer together, flying in a tight knot directly above the transport, and let the keel 
of the vessel carve a resting place in the ground with its own momentum. The British soldiers in the 
front ranks threw up their arms as an immense cloud of dirt burst into their faces, and then almost at 
once half of them fell dead: the whole front of the transport had unhinged like a barn door, and a volley 
of rifle-fire erupted from inside to mow down the front lines. 
A shout of “Vive l’Empereur!” went up as the French soldiers poured out through the smoke: more than 
a thousand men, dragging a pair of eighteen-pounders with them; the men formed into lines to protect 
the guns as the artillery-men hurried to bring their charges to bear. The redcoats fired off an answering 
volley, and a few moments later the militia managed a ragged one of their own, but the Frenchmen were 
hardened veterans; though dozens fell dead, the ranks shut tight to fill in their places, and the men held 
their ground. 
The four dragons who had carried the transport were flinging off their chains. Free of their burden, they 
rose again to join the fight, leaving the British aerial forces even more outnumbered than before. In a 
moment another transport would land under this increased protection, and its own carriers worsen the 
situation further. 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (189 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Maximus roared furiously, clawed free of the Grand Chevalier and made a sudden desperate stoop 
towards the next transport as it began to descend; no art or maneuver, he only flung himself down. Two 
smaller dragons tried to bar his way, but he had committed his full weight to the dive; though he took 
raking blows from their claws and teeth, he bowled them apart by sheer force. One was only knocked 
aside; the other, a red-and-blue-barred Honneur-d’Or, tumbled against the cliffs with one wing splayed 
helplessly. It scrabbled at the ragged stone face, sending powdery chalk flying as it tried to get purchase 
and climb up onto the cliff-top. 
A light frigate of some twenty-four guns, with a shallow draft, had been daring to stay near the coast; 
now she leapt at the chance: before the dragon could get up over the cliff’s edge, her full double-shotted 
broadside roared out like thunder. The French dragon screamed once over the noise and fell, broken; the 
unforgiving surf pounded its corpse and the remnants of its crew upon the rocks. 
Above, Maximus had landed on the second transport and was clawing at the chains; his weight was too 
much for the carriers to support, but they were struggling valiantly, and with a great heave in unison 
they managed to get the transport over the edge of the cliff as he finally broke the supports. The wooden 
shell fell twenty feet through the air and cracked open like an egg, spilling men and guns everywhere, 
but the distance was not great enough. Survivors were staggering to their feet almost at once, and they 
were safely behind their own already-established line. 
Maximus had landed heavily behind the British lines: his sides were steaming in the cold air, blood 
running freely from a dozen wounds and more, and his wings were drooped to the ground: he struggled 
to beat them again, to get aloft, and could not, but fell back onto his haunches trembling in every limb. 
Three or four thousand men already on the ground, and five guns; the British troops massed here only 
twenty thousand, and most of those militia, who were plainly unwilling to charge in the face of dragons 
above: many men were already trying to run. If the French commander had any sense at all, he would 
scarcely wait for another three or four transports to launch his own charge, and if his men overran the 
gun emplacements they could turn the artillery against the British dragons and clear the approaches 
completely. 
“Laurence,” Temeraire said, turning his head around, “two more of those vessels are going in to land.” 
“Yes,” Laurence said, low. “We must try and stop them; if they land, the battle on the ground is lost.” 
Temeraire was quiet a moment, even as he turned his path of flight onto an angle that would bring him 
ahead of the leading transport. Then he said, “Laurence, we cannot succeed, can we?” 
The two forward lookouts, young ensigns, were listening also, so that Laurence had to speak as much to 
them as to Temeraire. “Not forever, perhaps,” Laurence said. “But we may yet do enough to help protect 
England: if they are forced to land one at a time, or in worse positions, the militia may be able to hold 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (190 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
them for some time.” 
Temeraire nodded, and Laurence thought he understood the unspoken truth: the battle was lost, and even 
this was only a token attempt. “And we must still try, or we would be leaving our friends to fight 
without us,” Temeraire said. “I think this is what you have meant by duty, all along; I do understand, at 
least this much of it.” 
“Yes,” Laurence said, his throat aching. They had outstripped the transports and were over the ground 
now, with the militia a blurred sea of red below. Temeraire was swinging about to face the first of the 
transports head-on; there was only just enough time for Laurence to put his hand on Temeraire’s neck, a 
silent communion. 
The sight of land was putting heart into the French dragons: their speed was increasing. There were two 
Pêcheurs at the fore of the transport; roughly equal in size, and neither injured: Laurence left it to 
Temeraire to decide which would be his target, and reloaded his own pistols. 
Temeraire stopped and hovered in mid-air before the oncoming dragons, spreading his wings as if to bar 
the way; his ruff raised instinctively up, the webbed skin translucent grey in the sunlight. A slow, deep 
shudder passed along his length as he drew breath and his sides swelled out even further against his 
massive rib cage, making the bones stand out in relief: there was a strange stretched-tight quality to his 
skin, so that Laurence began to be alarmed: he could feel the air moving beneath, echoing, resonating, in 
the chambers of Temeraire’s lungs. 
A low reverberation seemed to build throughout Temeraire’s flesh, like a drum-beat rolling. 
“Temeraire,” Laurence called, or tried to; he could not hear himself speak at all. He felt a single 
tremendous shudder travel forward along Temeraire’s body, all the gathered breath caught up in that 
motion: Temeraire opened his jaws, and what emerged was a roar that was less sound than force, a 
terrible wave of noise so vast it seemed to distort the air before him. 
Laurence could not see for a moment through the brief haze; when his vision cleared, he at first did not 
understand. Ahead of them, the transport was shattering as if beneath the force of a full broadside, the 
light wood cracking like gunfire, men and cannon spilling out into the broken surf far below at the foot 
of the cliffs. His jaw and ears were aching as if he had been struck on the head, and Temeraire’s body 
was still trembling beneath him. 
“Laurence, I think I did that,” Temeraire said; he sounded more shocked than pleased. Laurence shared 
his sentiments: he could not immediately bring himself to speak. 
The four dragons were still attached to the beams of the ruined transport, and the fore dragon to larboard 
was bleeding from its nostrils, choking and crying in pain. Hurrying to save the dragon, its crew cast off 
the chains, letting the fragment fall away, and it managed the last quarter mile to land behind the French 
lines. The captain and crew leapt down at once; the injured dragon was huddled and pawing at its head, 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (191 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
moaning. 
Behind them, a wild cheer was going up from the British ranks, and gunfire from the French: the 
soldiers on the ground were shooting at Temeraire. “Sir, we are in range of those cannon, if they get 
them loaded,” Martin said urgently. 
Temeraire heard and dashed out over the water, for the moment beyond their reach, and hovered in 
place. The French advance had halted for a moment, several of the defenders milling about, wary of 
coming closer and as confused as Laurence and Temeraire himself were. But in a moment the French 
captains above might understand, or at least collect themselves; they would make a concerted attack on 
Temeraire and bring him down. There was only a little time left in which to make use of the surprise. 
“Temeraire,” he called urgently, “fly lower and try if you can striking at those transports from below, at 
cliff-height. Mr. Turner,” he said, turning to the signal-ensign, “give those ships below a gun and show 
them the signal for engage the enemy more closely; I believe they will take my meaning.” 
“I will try,” Temeraire said uncertainly, and dived lower, gathering himself and once again taking that 
tremendous swelling breath. Curving back upwards, he roared once again, this time at the underside of 
one of the transports still over the water. The distance was greater, and the vessel did not wholly shatter, 
but great cracks opened in the planks of the hull; the four dragons above were at once desperately 
occupied in keeping it from breaking open all the rest of the way. 
An arrow-head formation of French dragons came diving directly towards them, some six heavyweight 
dragons behind the Grand Chevalier in the lead. Temeraire darted away and at Laurence’s touch dropped 
lower over the water, where half a dozen frigates and three ships-of-the-line lay in wait. As they swept 
past their long guns spoke in a rolling broadside, one gun after another, scattering the French dragons 
into shrill confusion as they tried to avoid the flying grapeshot and cannonballs. 
“Now, quickly, the next one,” Laurence called to Temeraire, though the order was scarcely necessary: 
Temeraire had already doubled back upon himself. He went directly at the underside of the next 
transport in line: the largest, flown by four heavyweight dragons, and with ensigns of golden eagles 
flying from the deck. 
“Those are his flags, are they not?” Temeraire called back. “Bonaparte is on there?” 
“More likely one of his Marshals,” Laurence shouted over the wind, but he felt a wild excitement 
anyway. The defenders were forming up again at a higher elevation, ready to come after them once 
more; but Temeraire beat forward with ferocious zeal and outdistanced them. This larger transport, made 
of heavier wood, did not break as easily; even so, the wood cracked like the sound of pistol-shot, 
splinters flying everywhere. 
Temeraire dived down to attempt a second pass; suddenly Lily was flying alongside them, and

Obversaria on their other side, Lenton bellowing through his speaking-trumpet, “Go at them, just go at 
them; we will take care of those damned buggers—” and the two of them whirled to intercept the French 
defenders coming after Temeraire again. 
But even as Temeraire began his climb, fresh signals went up from the damaged transport. The four 
dragons who were carrying it together wheeled around and began to pull away; and across the battlefield 
all the transports still aloft gave way and turned, for the long and weary flight back in retreat to France. 
  
Epilogue 
 
“LAURENCE, BE A good fellow and bring me a glass of wine,” Jane Roland said, all but falling into 
the chair beside his, without the slightest care for the ruin she was making of her skirts. “Two sets is 
more than enough dancing for me; I am not getting up from this table again until I leave.” 
“Should you prefer to go at once?” he asked, rising. “I am happy to take you.” 
“If you mean I am so ungainly in a dress that you think I cannot walk a quarter of a mile over even 
ground without falling down, you may say so, and then I will knock you on the head with this charming 
reticule,” she said, with her deep laugh. “I have not got myself up in this fashion to waste it by running 
away so soon. Excidium and I will be back at Dover in a week, and then Lord knows how long it will be 
before I have another chance to see a ball, much less one supposedly in our honor.” 
“I will fetch and carry with you, Laurence. If they are not going to feed us anything more than these 
French tidbits, I am going to get more of them,” Chenery said, getting up from his chair as well. 
“Hear, hear,” Berkley said. “Bring the platter.” 
They were parted at the tables by the crush of the crowd, which was growing extreme as the hour drew 
on; London society was still nearly delirious with joy over the joint victories at Trafalgar and Dover, and 
temporarily as happy to enthuse over the aviators as it had been to disdain them before. His coat and 
bars won him enough smiles and gestures of precedence that Laurence managed to acquire the glass of 
wine without great difficulty. Reluctantly he gave up the notion of taking a cigar for himself; it would 
have been the height of rudeness to indulge while Jane and Harcourt could not. He took a second glass 
instead; he imagined someone at the table would care for it. 
Both his hands thus occupied, he was happily not forced to do more than bow slightly when he was

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
addressed on his way back to the table. “Captain Laurence,” Miss Montagu said, smiling with a great 
deal more friendliness than she had shown him in his parents’ house; she looked disappointed to not be 
able to give him her hand. “How splendid it is to see you again; it has been ages since we were all 
together at Wollaton Hall. How is dear Temeraire? My heart was in my throat when I heard of the news; 
I was sure you should be in the thick of the battle, and so of course it was.” 
“He is very well, thank you,” Laurence said, as politely as he could manage; dear Temeraire rankled 
extremely. But he was not going to be openly rude to a woman he had met as one of his parents’ guests, 
even if his father had not yet been softened by society’s new approbation; there was no sense in 
aggravating the quarrel and perhaps needlessly making his mother’s situation more difficult. 
“May I present you to Lord Winsdale?” she said, turning to her companion. “This is Captain Laurence; 
Lord Allendale’s son, you know,” she added, in an undertone that Laurence could barely hear. 
“Certainly, certainly,” Winsdale said, offering a very slight nod, what he appeared to think a piece of 
great condescension. “Quite the man of the hour, Laurence; you are to be highly commended. We must 
all count ourselves fortunate that you were able to acquire the animal for England.” 
“You are too kind to say so, Winsdale,” Laurence said, deliberately forward to the same degree. “You 
must excuse me; this wine will grow too warm shortly.” 
Miss Montagu could hardly miss the shortness of his tone now; she looked angry for a moment, then 
said, with great sweetness, “Of course! Perhaps you are going to see Miss Galman, and can bear her my 
greetings? Oh, but how absurd of me; I must say Mrs. Woolvey, now, and she is not in town any longer, 
is she?” 
He regarded her with dislike; he wondered at the combination of perception and spite that had enabled 
her to ferret out the former connection between himself and Edith. “No, I believe she and her husband 
are presently touring the lake country,” he said, and bowed himself away, deeply grateful that she had 
not had the opportunity of surprising him with the news. 
His mother had given him intelligence of the match in a letter sent only shortly after the battle, and 
reaching him still at Dover; she had written, after conveying the news of the engagement, “I hope what I 
write does not give you too much pain; I know you have long admired her, and indeed I have always 
considered her charming, although I cannot think highly of her judgment in this matter.” 
The true blow had fallen long before the letter came; news of Edith’s marriage to another man could not 
be unexpected, and he had been able to reassure his mother with perfect sincerity. Indeed, he could not 
fault Edith’s judgment: in retrospect he saw how very disastrous the match would have been, on both 
sides; he could not have spared her so much as a thought for the last nine months or more. There was no 
reason Woolvey should not make Edith a perfectly good husband. He himself certainly could not have, 
and he thought that he would truly be able to wish her happy, if he saw her again.

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
But he was still irritated by Miss Montagu’s insinuations, and his face had evidently set into somewhat 
forbidding lines; as he came back to the table, Jane took the glasses from him and said, “You were long 
enough about it; was someone pestering you? Do not pay them any mind; take a turn outside, and see 
how Temeraire is enjoying himself: that will put you in a better frame of mind.” 
The notion appealed immensely. “I think I will, if you will pardon me,” he said, with a bow to the 
company. 
“Look in on Maximus for me, see if he wants any more dinner,” Berkley called after him. 
“And Lily!” Harcourt said, then looked guiltily about to see if any of the guests at the nearby tables had 
overheard: naturally the company did not realize that the women with the aviators were themselves 
captains, and assumed them rather wives, though Jane’s scarred face had earned several startled looks, 
which she ignored with perfect ease. 
Laurence left the table to their noisy and spirited discussion, making his way outdoors. The ancient 
covert near London had long ago been encroached upon by the city and given up by the Corps, save for 
use by couriers, but for the occasion it had been briefly reclaimed, and a great pavilion established at the 
northern edge where the headquarters had once stood. 
By the aviators’ request, the musicians had been set at the very edge of the pavilion, where the dragons 
could gather around outside to listen. The musicians had been at first somewhat distressed by the notion 
and inclined to edge their chairs away, but as the evening wore on and the dragons proved a more 
appreciative audience than the noisy crowd of society, their fear was gradually overcome by their vanity. 
Laurence came out to find the first violinist having abandoned the orchestra entirely and playing 
snatches of various airs in a rather didactic manner for the dragons, demonstrating the work of different 
composers. 
Maximus and Lily were among the interested group, listening with fascination and asking a great many 
questions. Laurence saw after a moment, with some surprise, that Temeraire was instead curled up in a 
small clearing beyond the others, off to the side and talking with a gentleman whose face Laurence 
could not see. 
He skirted the group and approached, calling Temeraire’s name softly; the man turned, hearing him. 
With a start of pleasant surprise, Laurence recognized Sir Edward Howe, and hurried forward to greet 
him. 
“I am very happy indeed to see you, sir,” Laurence said, shaking his hand. “I had not heard that you 
were back in London, although I made a point of inquiring after you when we first arrived.” 
“I was in Ireland when the news reached me; I have only just come to London,” Sir Edward said, and 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (195 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Laurence only then noticed that he was still in traveling-clothes, and his boots were dust-stained. “I hope 
you will forgive me; I presumed on our acquaintance to come despite the lack of a formal invitation, in 
hopes of speaking with you at once. When I saw the crowd inside, I thought it best to come and stay 
with Temeraire until you appeared rather than try to seek you within.” 
“Indeed, I am in your debt for putting yourself to so much trouble,” Laurence said. “I confess I have 
been very anxious to speak with you ever since discovering Temeraire’s ability, which I expect is the 
news which has brought you. All he can tell us is that the sensation is the same as that of roaring; we 
cannot account for how mere sound might produce so extraordinary an effect, and none of us have ever 
heard of anything like.” 
“No, you would not have,” Sir Edward said. “Laurence—” He stopped and glanced at the crowd of 
dragons between them and the pavilion, all now rumbling in approval at the close of the first 
performance. “Might we speak somewhere in more privacy?” 
“We can always go to my own clearing, if you would like to be somewhere quieter,” Temeraire said. “I 
am happy to carry you both, and it will not take me a moment to fly there.” 
“Perhaps that would be best, if you have no objection?” Sir Edward asked Laurence, and Temeraire 
brought them over carefully in his foreclaws, setting them down in the deserted clearing before settling 
himself comfortably. “I must beg your pardon for putting you to such trouble, and interrupting your 
evening,” Sir Edward said. 
“Sir, I assure you I am very happy to have it interrupted in this cause,” Laurence said. “Pray have no 
concern on that score.” He was impatient to learn what Sir Edward might know; a concern over 
Temeraire’s safety from some possible agent of Napoleon’s lingered with him, perhaps even increased 
by the victory. 
“I will keep you in suspense no longer,” Sir Edward said. “Although I do not in the least pretend to 
understand the mechanical principles by which Temeraire’s ability operates, the effects are described in 
literature, and so I may identify it for you: the Chinese, and the Japanese, for that matter, call it by the 
name divine wind. This tells you little beyond what you already know from example, I am afraid, but the 
true importance lies in this: it is an ability unique to one breed and one breed alone—the Celestial.” 
The name hung in silence for long moments; Laurence did not immediately know what to think. 
Temeraire looked between them uncertainly. “Is that very different from an Imperial?” he asked. “Are 
they not both Chinese breeds?” 
“Very different indeed,” Sir Edward answered him. “Imperial dragons are rare enough; but the Celestials 
are given only to the Emperors themselves, or their nearest kin. I should be surprised if there were more 
than a few score in all the world.” 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (196 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
“The Emperors themselves,” Laurence repeated, in wonder and slowly growing comprehension. “You 
will not have heard this, sir, but we took a French spy at the covert in Dover shortly before the battle: he 
revealed to us that Temeraire’s egg was meant not merely for France, but for Bonaparte himself.” 
Sir Edward nodded. “I am not surprised to hear as much. The Senate voted Bonaparte the crown in May 
before last; the time of your encounter with the French vessel suggests the Chinese gave him the egg as 
soon as they learned. I cannot imagine why they should have made him such a gift; they have given no 
other signs of allying themselves with France, but the timing is too exact for any other explanation.” 
“And if they had some notion of when to expect the hatching, that might well explain the mode of 
transport as well,” Laurence finished for him. “Seven months from China to France, around Cape Horn: 
the French could hardly have hoped to manage it except with a fast frigate, regardless of the risk.” 
“Laurence,” Sir Edward said with pronounced unhappiness, “I must heartily beg your forgiveness for 
having so misled you. I cannot even plead the excuse of ignorance: I have read descriptions of 
Celestials, and seen many drawings of them. It simply never occurred to me that the ruff and tendrils 
might not develop save with maturity; in body and wing-shape they are identical to the Imperials.” 
“I beg you not to refine upon it, sir; no forgiveness is called for, in the least,” Laurence said. “It could 
scarcely have made much difference to his training, and in the event, we have learned of his ability in 
very good time.” He smiled up at Temeraire, and stroked the sleek foreleg beside him, while Temeraire 
snorted in happy agreement. “So, my dear, you are a Celestial; I should not be surprised at all. No 
wonder Bonaparte was in such a taking to lose you.” 
“I imagine he will continue angry,” Sir Edward said. “And what is worse, we may have the Chinese on 
our necks over it, when they learn; they are prickly to an extreme, where the Emperor’s standing may be 
said to be concerned, and I do not doubt they will be annoyed to see a British serving officer in 
possession of their treasure.” 
“I do not see how it concerns either Napoleon or them in the least,” Temeraire said, bristling. “I am no 
longer in the shell, and I do not care if Laurence is not an emperor. We defeated Napoleon in battle and 
made him fly away even though he is one; I cannot see that there is anything particularly nice about the 
title.” 
“Never fret, my dear; they have no grounds on which to make objection,” Laurence said. “We did not 
take you from a Chinese vessel, arguably a neutral, but from a French man-of-war; they chose to hand 
your egg to our enemy, and you were wholly lawful prize.” 
“I am glad to hear it,” Sir Edward said, though he looked doubtful. “They may still choose to be 
quarrelsome about it; their regard for the laws of other nations is very small, and vanishes entirely where 
it conflicts with their own notions of proper behavior. Pray have you any notion of how they stand with 
respect to us?”

“They could make a pretty loud noise, I suppose,” Laurence said uncertainly. “I know they have no navy 
to speak of, but one hears a great deal of their dragons. I will bring the news to Admiral Lenton, though, 
and I am sure he will know better than I do how to meet any possible difference of opinion with them 
over the matter.” 
A rushing sound of wings came overhead, and the ground shook with impact: Maximus had come flying 
back to his own clearing, only a short distance away; Laurence could see his red-gold hide visible 
through the trees. Several smaller dragons flew past overhead also, going back to their own resting 
places: the ball was evidently breaking up, and Laurence realized from the low-burning lanterns that the 
hour had grown late. 
“You must be tired from your journey,” he said, turning back to Sir Edward. “I am once again deeply 
obliged to you, sir, for bringing me this intelligence. May I ask you, as a further favor, to join me for 
dinner tomorrow? I do not wish to keep you standing about in this cold, but I confess I have a great 
many questions on the subject I should like to put to you, and I would be happy to learn anything more 
you know of Celestials.” 
“It will be my pleasure,” Sir Edward said, and bowed to both of them. “No, I thank you; I can find my 
own way out,” he said, when Laurence would have accompanied him. “I grew up in London, and would 
often come wandering about here as a boy, dreaming of dragons; I dare say I know the place better than 
do you, if you have only been here a few days.” He bade them farewell, having arranged the 
appointment. 
  
Laurence had meant to stay the night at a nearby hotel where Captain Roland had taken a room, but he 
found he was disinclined to leave Temeraire; instead he searched out some old blankets in the stable 
being used by the ground crew, and made himself a somewhat dusty nest in Temeraire’s arms, his coat 
rolled up to serve as a pillow. He would make his apologies in the morning; Jane would understand. 
“Laurence, what is China like?” Temeraire asked idly, after they had settled down together, his wings 
sheltering them from the wintry air. 
“I have never been, my dear; only to India,” he said. “But I understand it is very splendid; it is the oldest 
nation in the world, you know; it even predates Rome. And certainly their dragons are the finest in the 
world,” he added, and saw Temeraire preen with satisfaction. 
“Well, perhaps we may visit, when the war is over and we have won. I would like to meet another 
Celestial someday,” Temeraire said. “But as for their sending me to Napoleon, that is great nonsense; I 
am never going to let anyone take you from me.”

“Nor I, my dear,” Laurence said, smiling, despite all the complications which he knew might arise if 
China did object. In his heart he shared the simplicity of Temeraire’s view of the matter, and he fell 
asleep almost at once in the security of the slow, deep rushing of Temeraire’s heartbeat, so very much 
like the endless sound of the sea. 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
Selected extracts from 
Observations on the Order Draconia in Europe, with Notes on the Oriental 
Breeds 
By Sir Edward Howe, F.R.S. 
LONDON 
JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET 
1796 
Prefatory Note from the Author on the Measure of Dragon Weights 
INCREDULITY IS THE likely response of most of my readers to the figures which appear hereinafter to 
describe the weight of various dragon breeds, as being wholly disproportionate to those which have 
hitherto been reported. The estimate of 10 tonnes for a full-grown Regal Copper is commonly known, 
and such prodigious bulk must already strain the imagination; what then must the reader think, when I 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (199 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
report this a vast understatement and claim a figure closer to 30 tonnes, indeed reaching so high as 50 
for the largest of this breed? 
For explanation I must direct the reader to the recent work of M. Cuvier. In his latest anatomical studies 
of the air-sacs which enable draconic flight, M. Cuvier has drawn in turn upon the work of Mr. 
Cavendish and his successful isolation of those peculiar gases, lighter than the general composition of 
the air, which fill the sacs, and has correspondingly proposed a new system of measurement, which by 
compensating for the weight displaced by the air-sacs provides a better degree of comparison between 
the weight of dragons and that of other large land animals, lacking in these organs. 
Those who have never seen a dragon in the flesh, and most particularly never one of the very largest 
breeds, in whom this discrepancy shall appear the most pronounced, may be sceptical; those who have 
had the opportunity, as I have, of seeing a Regal Copper side by side with the very largest of the Indian 
elephants, who have been measured at some 6 tonnes themselves, will I hope join me in greatly 
preferring a scheme of measurement which does not ridiculously suggest that the one, who could devour 
the other nearly in a bite, should weigh less than twice as much.

Chapter V 
Breeds native to the British Isles—Common breeds—Relation to Continental breeds—The effect of 
modern diet upon size—Heredity of Regal Copper—Venomous and Vitriolic breeds. 
. . . IT IS AS well to recollect that Yellow Reapers, so often unjustly regarded with that contempt 
engendered by familiarity, are to be found everywhere because of their many excellent qualities: 
generally hardy and not fastidious in their diet, untroubled by all but the worst extremes of heat or cold, 
almost invariably good-humoured in character, they have contributed to almost every bloodline in these 
Isles. These dragons fall squarely into the middle-weight range, though they range more widely within 
the breed than most, from a weight of some 10 tonnes to as many as 17, in a recent large specimen. 
Ordinarily they fall between 12 and 15 tonnes, with a length generally of 50 feet, and a nicely 
proportioned wingspan of 80 feet. 
Malachite Reapers are most easily distinguished from their more common cousins by colouration: while 
Yellow Reapers are mottled yellow, sometimes with white tiger-striping along their sides and wings, 
Malachite Reapers are a more muted yellow-brown with pale green markings. They are generally 
believed to be the result of unguided interbreeding during the Anglo-Saxon conquests between Yellow 
Reapers and Scandinavian Lindorms. Preferring cooler climes, they are generally to be found in north-
eastern Scotland. 
From hunting records and bone collections, we know that the Grey Widowmaker breed was once very 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (200 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
nearly as common as the Reapers, though now they are rarely to be found; this breed being so violently 
intractable and given to stealing domesticated cattle has been made nearly extinct through hunting, 
though some individuals may be found living wild even to this day in isolated mountainous regions, 
particularly in Scotland, and a few more have been coaxed into breeding grounds to preserve as basic 
stock. They are small and aggressive by nature, rarely exceeding 8 tonnes, and their colouration of 
mottled grey is ideal for concealment while flying, which inspired their cross-breeding with the more 
even-tempered Winchesters to produce the Greyling breed. 
The most common French breeds, the Pêcheur-Couronné and Pêcheur-Rayé, are more closely related to 
the Widowmaker breed than to the Reapers, if we may judge by wing conformation and the structure of 
the breast-bone, which in both breeds is keeled and fused with the clavicle. This anatomical peculiarity 
renders them both more useful for breeding down into light-combat and courier breeds, rather than into 
heavy-combat breeds. . . . 
Cross-breeding with Continental species is also the source of all the heavy-weight breeds now to be 
found in Britain, none of which can be considered properly native to our shores. Most likely this is due 
to climate: heavier dragons greatly prefer warm environs, where their air-sacs can more easily 
compensate for their tremendous weight. It has been suggested that the British Isles cannot support herds 
vast enough to sustain the largest breeds; the flaws to this chain of reasoning may be shown by 
consideration of the very wide variations in diet to be tolerated among dragons insofar as quantity is 
concerned. 
In the wild, it is well known, dragons eat so infrequently as once every two weeks, particularly in 
summer when they prefer to sleep a great deal and their natural prey are at their fattest; it will then come 
as no surprise to learn that dragons in the wild do not begin to approach the sizes which can be found 
among their domesticated cousins, fed daily and more, particularly during the early years so critical to 
growth. 
By way of example we have only to consider the barren desert regions of Almería in the south-east of 
Spain, scantly inhabited by goats, which are the native grounds of the fierce Cauchador Real, part 
ancestor of our own Regal Copper; in domestication this breed reaches a fighting weight of some 25 
tonnes, but in the wild is scarcely to be found over 10 or 12 tonnes. . . . 
The Regal Copper exceeds in size all other breeds presently known, reaching in maturity as many as 50 
tonnes in weight and 120 feet in length. They are dramatic in colour, shading from red to yellow with 
much variation between individuals. The male of the species is on the average slightly smaller than the 
female and develops forehead horns in maturity; both sexes have a marked spiny column along the back, 
which renders them particularly hazardous targets for boarding operations. 
These great beasts are unquestionably the greatest triumph of the British breeding grounds, the product 
of some ten generations’ labour and careful cross-breeding, and illustrative of the unanticipated benefits 
which may be yielded by matings not perhaps of obvious value. It was Roger Bacon who first proposed 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (201 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
the notion of breeding females of the smaller Bright Copper species to the great sire Conquistador, 
brought to England as part of the dowry of Eleanor of Castile. Though his suggestions were founded in 
the erroneous supposition of the time, which thought colour to be indicative of some elemental 
influence, and the shared orange colour of the two breeds a sign of underlying congruence, the cross was 
a fruitful one, leading to offspring even larger than their prodigious sire, and better able to sustain flight 
over distance. 
Mr. Josiah Colquhoun of Glasgow has suggested that the disproportionate size of the air-sacs of the 
Bright Copper, relative to their frame, properly deserves the credit for this success, and it is certain that 
Regal Coppers share this trait of their female progenitors. M. Cuvier’s anatomical studies suggest that 
indeed the vast bulk of the Regal Copper would crush the very breath out of the dragons’ lungs, if 
unsupported by aught but their surprisingly delicate skeletal systems. . . . 
While no pyrogenic species are to be found in the British Isles, despite many attempts on the part of our 
breeders to induce this most valuable trait, so deadly to our shipping in the persons of the French 
Flamme-de-Gloire and the Spanish Flecha-del-Fuego, the native Sharpspitter breed is notable for 
producing a venom to incapacitate its prey. Though the Sharpspitter itself is too small and low-flying to 
be of great value as a fighting beast, cross-breeding with the French Honneur-d’Or, for size, and with the 
Russian Ironwing, another venomous species, yielded several valuable crosses: better fliers, middle-
weight in size, with more potent venom. 
Interbreeding among these, with frequent infusions from the parent breeds, culminated in the successful 
hatching of the first dragon which can properly be termed a Longwing, during the reign of Henry VII. In 
this breed, the venom had become so potent as to be more properly termed acid, and of a strength which 
could be turned not only against other beasts, but against targets upon the ground. The only other truly 
vitriolic breeds known to us at present are the Copacati, an Incan breed, and the Ka-Riu of Japan. 
Longwings are unfortunately instantly identifiable upon the battlefield and impossible to decoy, due to 
the unusual proportions for which they are named; though they rarely exceed 60 feet in length, 
wingspans of 120 feet are not uncommon among them, and their wing colouration is particularly 
dramatic, shading from blue to orange, with vivid black-and-white striations at the rims. They possess 
the same yellow-orange eyes as their progenitor the Sharpspitter, which are exceptionally good. Though 
the breed was first considered intractable, and indeed some consideration was given to their destruction, 
as too dangerous to be left unharnessed, during the reign of Elizabeth I new methods of harnessing were 
developed which secured the general domestication of the breed, and they were instrumental in the 
destruction of the Armada. . . .

. . . THE SECRETS OF the Imperial breeding programme are most jealously guarded, as the national 
treasures which they assuredly are, and transmitted strictly through word of mouth among a trusted line 
and through documents encoded by closely held ciphers. Very little is therefore known in the West, and 
indeed anywhere outside the precincts of the imperial capital, about these breeds. 
Brief observations by travellers have yielded only a handful of incomplete details; we know that the 
Imperial and Celestial are distinguished by the number of talons on their claws, which are five, unlike 
virtually every other draconic breed, being four-fingered; similarly, their wings have six spines rather 
than the five common to European breeds. In the Orient, these breeds are popularly supposed to be 
highly superior in intelligence, retaining into adulthood that remarkable facility of memory and 
linguistic ability which dragons ordinarily lose early in life. 
For the veracity of this claim we have but one recent witness, though a reliable one: M. le Comte de la 
Pérouse encountered an Imperial dragon at the Korean court, who through their close relations to the 
court of China have been often granted the privilege of an Imperial egg. The first Frenchman to attend at 
this court in recent memory, he was asked for lessons in his native tongue, and by his reports, the dragon 
though full-grown was well able to hold a conversation by the time of his departure, some one month 
later, an achievement hardly to be scorned even by a gifted linguist. . . . 
That the Celestial is closely related to the Imperial may be inferred from the few illustrations we in the 
West have managed to obtain of this breed, but very little else is known of them. The divine wind, that 
most mysterious of draconic abilities, is known to us only by hearsay, which would have us believe that 
the Celestials are able to produce earthquakes or storms, capable of leveling a city. Plainly the effects 
have been heartily exaggerated, but there is considerable practical respect for the ability among the 
Oriental nations, which cautions against any rash dismissal of this gift as pure phantasy. . . .

Praise for His Majesty’s Dragon 
“A splendid novel. Not only is it a new way to utilize dragons, it’s a very clever one and fits neatly into 
the historical niche this author has used. The plot was excellent, extraordinary in that the reader has no 
idea where it’s leading—which is always fun. Let’s hope this is the first of many from Naomi Novik. 
She’ll be one to watch.” 
—ANNE MCCAFFREY 
“One of the best books I’ve read in years—a truly new approach. Lots of fun and cleverly thought out 
ideas. His Majesty’s Dragon brings the Napoleonic era back to life with a delightful new twist.” 
—DAVID FEINTUCH, 
author of Midshipman’s Hope and the Nicholas Seafort series 
“Wow! His Majesty’s Dragon is a wonderful book, stylish, witty, engaging, thoughtful. The changes in 
social structure to accommodate dragons and aviators make good sense; the conflict Laurence has with 
his family and his onetime fiancée as a result adds a great deal to the depth of the story. There’s a 
reasonable approach to aerial tactics within dragon limitations, as well. As for Temeraire himself . . . the 
most engaging fictional dragon since MacAvoy’s Tea with the Black Dragon.” 
—ELIZABETH MOON, 
author of Marque and Reprisal 
“Readers with a penchant for Patrick O’Brian and Anne McCaffrey may have found their perfect match 
with His Majesty’s Dragon. Naomi Novik beautifully renders an eighteenth-century Europe in which 
both naval buffs and dragon lovers will be keen to immerse themselves.”

THE DAY WAS unseasonably warm for November, but in some misguided deference to the Chinese 
embassy, the fire in the Admiralty boardroom had been heaped excessively high, and Laurence was 
standing directly before it. He had dressed with especial care, in his best uniform, and all throughout the 
long and unbearable interview, the lining of his thick bottle-green broadcloth coat had been growing 
steadily more sodden with sweat. 
Over the doorway, behind Lord Barham, the official indicator with its compass arrow showed the 
direction of the wind over the Channel: in the north-north-east today, fair for France; very likely even 
now some ships of the Channel Fleet were standing in to have a look at Napoleon’s harbors. His 
shoulders held at attention, Laurence fixed his eyes upon the broad metal disk and tried to keep himself 
distracted with such speculation; he did not trust himself to meet the cold, unfriendly gaze fixed upon 
him. 
Barham stopped speaking and coughed again into his fist; the elaborate phrases he had prepared sat not 
at all in his sailor’s mouth, and at the end of every awkward, halting line, he stopped and darted a look 
over at the Chinese with a nervous agitation that approached obsequity. It was not a very creditable 
performance, but under ordinary circumstances, Laurence would have felt a degree of sympathy for 
Barham’s position: some sort of formal message had been anticipated, even perhaps an envoy, but no

one had ever imagined that the Emperor of China would send his own brother halfway around the world. 
Prince Yongxing could, with a word, set their two nations at war; and there was besides something 
inherently awful in his presence: the impervious silence with which he met Barham’s every remark; the 
overwhelming splendor of his dark yellow robes, embroidered thickly with dragons; the slow and 
relentless tapping of his long, jewel-encrusted fingernail against the arm of his chair. He did not even 
look at Barham: he only stared directly across the table at Laurence, grim and thin-lipped. 
His retinue was so large they filled the boardroom to the corners, a dozen guards all sweltering and 
dazed in their quilted armor and as many servants besides, most with nothing to do, only attendants of 
one sort or another, all of them standing along the far wall of the room and trying to stir the air with 
broad-paneled fans. One man, evidently a translator, stood behind the prince, murmuring when 
Yongxing lifted a hand, generally after one of Barham’s more involved periods. 
Two other official envoys sat to Yongxing’s either side. These men had been presented to Laurence only 
perfunctorily, and they had neither of them said a word, though the younger, called Sun Kai, had been 
watching all the proceedings, impassively, and following the translator’s words with quiet attention. The 
elder, a big, round-bellied man with a tufted grey beard, had gradually been overcome by the heat: his 
head had sunk forward onto his chest, mouth half-open for air, and his hand was barely even moving his 
fan towards his face. They were robed in dark blue silk, almost as elaborately as the prince himself, and 
together they made an imposing façade: certainly no such embassy had ever been seen in the West. 
A far more practiced diplomat than Barham might have been pardoned for succumbing to some degree 
of servility, but Laurence was scarcely in any mood to be forgiving; though he was nearly more furious 
with himself, at having hoped for anything better. He had come expecting to plead his case, and 
privately in his heart he had even imagined a reprieve; instead he had been scolded in terms he would 
have scrupled to use to a raw lieutenant, and all in front of a foreign prince and his retinue, assembled 
like a tribunal to hear his crimes. Still he held his tongue as long as he could manage, but when Barham 
at last came about to saying, with an air of great condescension, “Naturally, Captain, we have it in mind 
that you shall be put to another hatchling, afterwards,” Laurence had reached his limit. 
“No, sir,” he said, breaking in. “I am sorry, but no: I will not do it, and as for another post, I must beg to 
be excused.” 
Sitting beside Barham, Admiral Powys of the Aerial Corps had remained quite silent through the course 
of the meeting; now he only shook his head, without any appearance of surprise, and folded his hands 
together over his ample belly. Barham gave him a furious look and said to Laurence, “Perhaps I am not 
clear, Captain; this is not a request. You have been given your orders, you will carry them out.” 
“I will be hanged first,” Laurence said flatly, past caring that he was speaking in such terms to the First 
Lord of the Admiralty: the death of his career if he had still been a naval officer, and it could scarcely do 
him any good even as an aviator. Yet if they meant to send Temeraire away, back to China, his career as

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
an aviator was finished: he would never accept a position with any other dragon. None other would ever 
compare, to Laurence’s mind, and he would not subject a hatchling to being second-best when there 
were men in the Corps lined up six-deep for the chance. 
Yongxing did not say anything, but his lips tightened; his attendants shifted and murmured among 
themselves in their own language. Laurence did not think he was imagining the hint of disdain in their 
tone, directed less at himself than at Barham; and the First Lord evidently shared the impression, his face 
growing mottled and choleric with the effort of preserving the appearance of calm. “By God, Laurence; 
if you imagine you can stand here in the middle of Whitehall and mutiny, you are wrong; I think perhaps 
you are forgetting that your first duty is to your country and your King, not to this dragon of yours.” 
“No, sir; it is you who are forgetting. It was for duty I put Temeraire into harness, sacrificing my naval 
rank, with no knowledge then that he was any breed truly out of the ordinary, much less a Celestial,” 
Laurence said. “And for duty I took him through a difficult training and into a hard and dangerous 
service; for duty I have taken him into battle, and asked him to hazard his life and happiness. I will not 
answer such loyal service with lies and deceit.” 
“Enough noise, there,” Barham said. “Anyone would think you were being asked to hand over your 
firstborn. I am sorry if you have made such a pet of the creature you cannot bear to lose him—” 
“Temeraire is neither my pet nor my property, sir,” Laurence snapped. “He has served England and the 
King as much as I have, or you yourself, and now, because he does not choose to go back to China, you 
stand there and ask me to lie to him. I cannot imagine what claim to honor I should have if I agreed to it. 
Indeed,” he added, unable to restrain himself, “I wonder that you should even have made the proposal; I 
wonder at it greatly.” 
“Oh, your soul to the devil, Laurence,” Barham said, losing his last veneer of formality; he had been a 
serving sea-officer for years before joining Government, and he was still very little a politician when his 
temper was up. “He is a Chinese dragon, it stands to reason he will like China better; in any case, he 
belongs to them, and there is an end to it. The name of thief is a very unpleasant one, and His Majesty’s 
Government does not propose to invite it.” 
“I know how I am to take that, I suppose.” If Laurence had not already been half-broiled, he would have 
flushed. “And I utterly reject the accusation, sir. These gentlemen do not deny they had given the egg to 
France; we seized it from a French man-of-war; the ship and the egg were condemned as lawful prize 
out of hand in the Admiralty courts, as you very well know. By no possible understanding does 
Temeraire belong to them; if they were so anxious about letting a Celestial out of their hands, they ought 
not have given him away in the shell.” 
Yongxing snorted and broke into their shouting match. “That is correct,” he said; his English was thickly 
accented, formal and slow, but the measured cadences only lent all the more effect to his words. “From 
the first it was folly to let the second-born egg of Lung Tien Qian pass over sea. That, no one can now

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
dispute.” 
It silenced them both, and for a moment no one spoke, save the translator quietly rendering Yongxing’s 
words for the rest of the Chinese. Then Sun Kai unexpectedly said something in their tongue which 
made Yongxing look around at him sharply. Sun kept his head inclined deferentially, and did not look 
up, but still it was the first suggestion Laurence had seen that their embassy might perhaps not speak 
with a single voice. But Yongxing snapped a reply, in a tone which did not allow of any further 
comment, and Sun did not venture to make one. Satisfied that he had quelled his subordinate, Yongxing 
turned back to them and added, “Yet regardless of the evil chance that brought him into your hands, 
Lung Tien Xiang was meant to go to the French Emperor, not to be made beast of burden for a common 
soldier.” 
Laurence stiffened; common soldier rankled, and for the first time he turned to look directly at the 
prince, meeting that cold, contemptuous gaze with an equally steady one. “We are at war with France, 
sir; if you choose to ally yourself with our enemies and send them material assistance, you can hardly 
complain when we take it in fair fight.” 
“Nonsense!” Barham broke in, at once and loudly. “China is by no means an ally of France, by no 
means at all; we certainly do not view China as a French ally. You are not here to speak to His Imperial 
Highness, Laurence; control yourself,” he added, in a savage undertone. 
But Yongxing ignored the attempt at interruption. “And now you make piracy your defense?” he said, 
contemptuous. “We do not concern ourselves with the customs of barbaric nations. How merchants and 
thieves agree to pillage one another is not of interest to the Celestial Throne, except when they choose to 
insult the Emperor as you have.” 
“No, Your Highness, no such thing, not in the least,” Barham said hurriedly, even while he looked pure 
venom at Laurence. “His Majesty and his Government have nothing but the deepest affection for the 
Emperor; no insult would ever willingly be offered, I assure you. If we had only known of the 
extraordinary nature of the egg, of your objections, this situation would never have arisen—” 
“Now, however, you are well aware,” Yongxing said, “and the insult remains: Lung Tien Xiang is still 
in harness, treated little better than a horse, expected to carry burdens and exposed to all the brutalities 
of war, and all this, with a mere captain as his companion. Better had his egg sunk to the bottom of the 
ocean!” 
Appalled, Laurence was glad to see this callousness left Barham and Powys as staring and speechless as 
himself. Even among Yongxing’s own retinue, the translator flinched, shifting uneasily, and for once did 
not translate the prince’s words back into Chinese. 
“Sir, I assure you, since we learned of your objections, he has not been under harness at all, not a stitch 
of it,” Barham said, recovering. “We have been at the greatest of pains to see to Temeraire’s—that is, to

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Lung Tien Xiang’s—comfort, and to make redress for any inadequacy in his treatment. He is no longer 
assigned to Captain Laurence, that I can assure you: they have not spoken these last two weeks.” 
The reminder was a bitter one, and Laurence felt what little remained of his temper fraying away. “If 
either of you had any real concern for his comfort, you would consult his feelings, not your own 
desires,” he said, his voice rising, a voice which had been trained to bellow orders through a gale. “You 
complain of having him under harness, and in the same breath ask me to trick him into chains, so you 
might drag him away against his will. I will not do it; I will never do it, and be damned to you all.” 
Judging by his expression, Barham would have been glad to have Laurence himself dragged away in 
chains: eyes almost bulging, hands flat on the table, on the verge of rising; for the first time, Admiral 
Powys spoke, breaking in, and forestalled him. “Enough, Laurence, hold your tongue. Barham, nothing 
further can be served by keeping him. Out, Laurence; out at once: you are dismissed.” 
The long habit of obedience held: Laurence flung himself out of the room. The intervention likely saved 
him from an arrest for insubordination, but he went with no sense of gratitude; a thousand things were 
pent up in his throat, and even as the door swung heavily shut behind him, he turned back. But the 
Marines stationed to either side were gazing at him with thoughtlessly rude interest, as if he were a 
curiosity exhibited for their entertainment. Under their open, inquisitive looks he mastered his temper a 
little, and turned away before he could betray himself more fully. 
Barham’s words were swallowed by the heavy wood, but the inarticulate rumble of his still-raised voice 
followed Laurence down the corridor. He felt almost drunk with anger, his breath coming in short abrupt 
spurts and his vision obscured, not by tears, not at all by tears, except of rage. The antechamber of the 
Admiralty was full of sea-officers, clerks, political officials, even a green-coated aviator rushing through 
with dispatches. Laurence shouldered his way roughly to the doors, his shaking hands thrust deep into 
his coat pockets to conceal them from view. 
He struck out into the crashing din of late-afternoon London, Whitehall full of workingmen going home 
for their suppers, and the bawling of the hackney drivers and chair-men over all, crying, “Make a lane, 
there,” through the crowds. His feelings were as disordered as his surroundings, and he was navigating 
the street by instinct; he had to be called three times before he recognized his own name. 
He turned only reluctantly: he had no desire to be forced to return a civil word or gesture from a former 
colleague. But with a measure of relief he saw it was Captain Roland, not an ignorant acquaintance. He 
was surprised to see her; very surprised, for her dragon, Excidium, was a formation-leader at the Dover 
covert. She could not easily have been spared from her duties, and in any case she could not come to the 
Admiralty openly, being a female officer, one of those whose existence was made necessary by the 
insistence of Longwings on female captains. The secret was but barely known outside the ranks of the 
aviators, and jealously kept against certain public disapproval; Laurence himself had found it difficult to 
accept the notion, at first, but he had grown so used to the idea that now Roland looked very odd to him 
out of uniform: she had put on skirts and a heavy cloak by way of concealment, neither of which suited

her. 
“I have been puffing after you for the last five minutes,” she said, taking his arm as she reached him. “I 
was wandering about that great cavern of a building, waiting for you to come out, and then you went 
straight past me in such a ferocious hurry I could scarcely catch you. These clothes are a damned 
nuisance; I hope you appreciate the trouble I am taking for you, Laurence. But never mind,” she added, 
her voice gentling. “I can see from your face that it did not go well: let us go and have some dinner, and 
you shall tell me everything.” 
“Thank you, Jane; I am glad to see you,” he said, and let her turn him in the direction of her inn, though 
he did not think he could swallow. “How do you come to be here, though? Surely there is nothing wrong 
with Excidium?” 
“Nothing in the least, unless he has given himself indigestion,” she said. “No; but Lily and Captain 
Harcourt are coming along splendidly, and so Lenton was able to assign them a double patrol and give 
me a few days of liberty. Excidium took it as excuse to eat three fat cows at once, the wretched greedy 
thing; he barely cracked an eyelid when I proposed my leaving him with Sanders—that is my new first 
lieutenant—and coming to bear you company. So I put together a street-going rig and came up with the 
courier. Oh, hell: wait a minute, will you?” She stopped and kicked vigorously, shaking her skirts loose: 
they were too long, and had caught on her heels. 
He held her by the elbow so she did not topple over, and afterwards they continued on through the 
London streets at a slower pace. Roland’s mannish stride and scarred face drew enough rude stares that 
Laurence began to glare at the passersby who looked too long, though she herself paid them no mind; 
she noticed his behavior, however, and said, “You are ferocious out of temper; do not frighten those 
poor girls. What did those fellows say to you at the Admiralty?” 
“You have heard, I suppose, that an embassy has come from China; they mean to take Temeraire back 
with them, and Government does not care to object. But evidently he will have none of it: tells them all 
to go hang themselves, though they have been at him for weeks now to go,” Laurence said. As he spoke, 
a sharp sensation of pain, like a constriction just under his breastbone, made itself felt. He could picture 
quite clearly Temeraire kept nearly all alone in the old, worn-down London covert, scarcely used in the 
last hundred years, with neither Laurence nor his crew to keep him company, no one to read to him, and 
of his own kind only a few small courier-beasts flying through on dispatch service. 
“Of course he will not go,” Roland said. “I cannot believe they imagined they could persuade him to 
leave you. Surely they ought to know better; I have always heard the Chinese cried up as the very 
pinnacle of dragon-handlers.” 
“Their prince has made no secret he thinks very little of me; likely they expected Temeraire to share 
much the same opinion, and to be pleased to go back,” Laurence said. “In any case, they grow tired of 
trying to persuade him; so that villain Barham ordered I should lie to him and say we were assigned to

file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html
Gibraltar, all to get him aboard a transport and out to sea, too far for him to fly back to land, before he 
knew what they were about.” 
“Oh, infamous.” Her hand tightened almost painfully on his arm. “Did Powys have nothing to say to it? I 
cannot believe he let them suggest such a thing to you; one cannot expect a naval officer to understand 
these things, but Powys should have explained matters to him.” 
“I dare say he can do nothing; he is only a serving officer, and Barham is appointed by the Ministry,” 
Laurence said. “Powys at least saved me from putting my neck in a noose: I was too angry to control 
myself, and he sent me away.” 
They had reached the Strand; the increase in traffic made conversation difficult, and they had to pay 
attention to avoid being splashed by the questionable grey slush heaped in the gutters, thrown up onto 
the pavement by the lumbering carts and hackney wheels. His anger ebbing away, Laurence was 
increasingly low in his spirits. 
From the moment of separation, he had consoled himself with the daily expectation that it would soon 
end: the Chinese would soon see Temeraire did not wish to go, or the Admiralty would give up the 
attempt to placate them. It had seemed a cruel sentence even so; they had not been parted a full day’s 
time in the months since Temeraire’s hatching, and Laurence had scarcely known what to do with 
himself, or how to fill the hours. But even the two long weeks were nothing to this, the dreadful 
certainty that he had ruined all his chances. The Chinese would not yield, and the Ministry would find 
some way of getting Temeraire sent off to China in the end: they plainly had no objection to telling him 
a pack of lies for the purpose. Likely enough Barham would never consent to his seeing Temeraire now 
even for a last farewell. 
Laurence had not even allowed himself to consider what his own life might be with Temeraire gone. 
Another dragon was of course an impossibility, and the Navy would not have him back now. He 
supposed he could take on a ship in the merchant fleet, or a privateer; but he did not think he would have 
the heart for it, and he had done well enough out of prize-money to live on. He could even marry and set 
up as a country gentleman; but that prospect, once so idyllic in his imagination, now seemed drab and 
colorless. 
Worse yet, he could hardly look for sympathy: all his former acquaintance would call it a lucky escape, 
his family would rejoice, and the world would think nothing of his loss. By any measure, there was 
something ridiculous in his being so adrift: he had become an aviator quite unwillingly, only from the 
strongest sense of duty, and less than a year had passed since his change in station; yet already he could 
hardly consider the possibility. Only another aviator, perhaps indeed only another captain, would truly 
be able to understand his sentiments, and with Temeraire gone, he would be as severed from their 
company as aviators themselves were from the rest of the world. 
The front room at the Crown and Anchor was not quiet, though it was still early for dinner by town 
file:///K|/eMule/Incoming/Novik,%20Naomi%20-%20Temeraire%2001%20-%20His%20Majesty's%20Dragon.html (211 of 215)22-12-2006 15:57:34

standards. The place was not a fashionable establishment, nor even genteel, its custom mostly consisting 
of country-men used to a more reasonable hour for their food and drink. It was not the sort of place a 
respectable woman would have come, nor indeed the kind of place Laurence himself would have ever 
voluntarily frequented in earlier days. Roland drew some insolent stares, others only curious, but no one 
attempted any greater liberty: Laurence made an imposing figure beside her with his broad shoulders 
and his dress sword slung at his hip. 
Roland led Laurence up to her rooms, sat him in an ugly armchair, and gave him a glass of wine. He 
drank deeply, hiding behind the bowl of the glass from her sympathetic look: he was afraid he might 
easily be unmanned. “You must be faint with hunger, Laurence,” she said. “That is half the trouble.” She 
rang for the maid; shortly a couple of manservants climbed up with a very good sort of plain single-
course dinner: a roasted fowl, with greens and beef gravy sauce; some small cheese-cakes made with 
jam, calf’s feet pie, a dish of red cabbage stewed, and a small biscuit pudding for relish. She had them 
place all the food on the table at once, rather than going through removes, and sent them away. 
Laurence did not think he would eat, but once the food was before him he found he was hungry after all. 
He had been eating very indifferently, thanks to irregular hours and the low table of his cheap 
boardinghouse, chosen for its proximity to the covert where Temeraire was kept; now he ate steadily, 
Roland carrying the conversation nearly alone and distracting him with service gossip and trivialities. 
“I was sorry to lose Lloyd, of course—they mean to put him to the Anglewing egg that is hardening at 
Kinloch Laggan,” she said, speaking of her first lieutenant. 
“I think I saw it there,” Laurence said, rousing a little and lifting his head from his plate. “Obversaria’s 
egg?” 
“Yes, and we have great hopes of the issue,” she said. “Lloyd was over the moon, of course, and I am 
very happy for him; still, it is no easy thing to break in a new premier after five years, with all the crew 
and Excidium himself murmuring about how Lloyd used to do things. But Sanders is a good-hearted, 
dependable fellow; they sent him up from Gibraltar, after Granby refused the post.” 
“What? Refused it?” Laurence cried, in great dismay: Granby was his own first lieutenant. “Not for my 
sake, I hope.” 
“Oh, Lord, you did not know?” Roland said, in equal dismay. “Granby spoke to me very pretty; said he 
was obliged, but he did not choose to shift his position. I was quite sure he had consulted you about the 
matter; I thought perhaps you had been given some reason to hope.” 
“No,” Laurence said, very low. “He is more likely to end up with no position at all; I am very sorry to 
hear he should have passed up so good a place.” The refusal could have done Granby no good with the 
Corps; a man who had turned down one offer could not soon expect another, and Laurence would 
shortly have no power at all to help him along.

“Well, I am damned sorry to have given you any more cause for concern,” Roland said, after a moment. 
“Admiral Lenton has not broken up your crew, you know, for the most part: only gave a few fellows to 
Berkley out of desperation, he being so short-handed now. We were all so sure that Maximus had 
reached his final growth; shortly after you were called here, he began to prove us wrong, and so far he 
has put on fifteen feet in length.” She added this last in an attempt to recover the lighter tone of the 
conversation, but it was impossible: Laurence found that his stomach had closed, and he set down his 
knife and fork with the plate still half full. 
Roland drew the curtains; it was already growing dark outside. “Do you care for a concert?” 
“I am happy to accompany you,” he said mechanically, and she shook her head. 
“No, never mind; I see it will not do. Come to bed then, my dear fellow; there is no sense in sitting about 
and moping.” 
They put out the candles and lay down together. “I have not the least notion what to do,” he said quietly: 
the cover of dark made the confession a little easier. “I called Barham a villain, and I cannot forgive him 
asking me to lie; very ungentleman-like. But he is not a scrub; he would not be at such shifts if he had 
any other choice.” 
“It makes me quite ill to hear about him bowing and scraping to this foreign prince.” Roland propped 
herself up on her elbow on the pillows. “I was in Canton Harbor once, as a mid, on a transport coming 
back the long way from India; those junks of theirs do not look like they could stand a mild shower, 
much less a gale. They cannot fly their dragons across the ocean without a pause, even if they cared to 
go to war with us.” 
“I thought as much myself, when I first heard,” Laurence said. “But they do not need to fly across the 
ocean to end the China trade, and wreck our shipping to India also, if they liked; besides they share a 
border with Russia. It would mean the end of the coalition against Bonaparte, if the Tsar was attacked on 
his eastern borders.” 
“I do not see the Russians have done us very much good so far, in the war, and money is a low pitiful 
excuse for behaving like a bounder, in a man or a nation,” Roland said. “The State has been short of 
funds before, and somehow we have scraped by and still blacked Bonaparte’s eye for him. In any case, I 
cannot forgive them for keeping you from Temeraire. Barham still has not let you see him at all, I 
suppose?” 
“No, not for two weeks now. There is a decent fellow at the covert who has taken him messages for me, 
and lets me know that he is eating, but I cannot ask him to let me in: it would be a court-martial for us 
both. Though for my own part, I hardly know if I would let it stop me now.”

He could scarcely have imagined even saying such a thing, a year ago; he did not like to think it now, 
but honesty put the words into his mouth. Roland did not cry out against it, but then she was an aviator 
herself. She reached out to stroke his cheek, and drew him down to such comfort as might be found in 
her arms.
