About the Authors
Cheryl Chow has been a freelance writer, editor, and journalist for
more than 20 years, concentrating on health and social issues. She
has a diverse writing background, having written for magazines,
newspapers, webzines, and literary magazines. She and Dr. Chow
have coauthored a reference book on hepatitis and other liver 
diseases.
Coming from a family with a long line of medical doctors, Chow has
always been fascinated by medicine and science. After obtaining a
BA in psychology from Reed College, she pursued her own studies
into the effects of mind over body, and vice versa. She has con-
quered her own bouts with hypoglycemia, fatigue, and other health
issues through attention to lifestyle and diet. She has studied T’ai
Chi, chi kung, ba gua, and meditation from some world-renowned
teachers, and has also taught T’ai Chi exercises for health.
James H. Chow, MD, is the founder, CEO, and medical director of
multispecialty clinics offering integrative medicine and diverse
treatment modalities located in New York, Westchester, Chicago,
Atlanta, and San Diego. Dr. Chow specializes in emergency and
family medicine. Before he went into private practice almost 20
years ago, he was the director of the emergency department at Mt.
Sinai Hospital in Chicago for seven years. As an emergency doctor
at one of the busiest hospitals in the U.S., he has encountered and
treated almost every imaginable type of illness and injury. Dr. Chow
is licensed to practice medicine in Illinois, Georgia, and New York.
In 1996, Dr. Chow helped set up an American-style clinic in Beijing.
Dr. Chow is a member of American Academy of Emergency Medicine,
American Academy of Physician Executives, American Academy of
Sports Medicine, American Academy of General Medicine, American
Academy of Family Practice, Nippon Industrial Medicine Association,
and American Japanese Physicians Association. Having too much
time on his hands, Dr. Chow is currently involved with various med-
ical projects. He’s known among his friends and associates for his
unbounded energy, personal warmth, and sense of humor — had 
he not become a medical doctor, Dr. Chow could undoubtedly have
become a comedian.

Dedication
We dedicate this book to our mother, who has inspired us with her
indomitable spirit. Late in life she became a published novelist and
essayist (with fan mail from all over the world). Always young at
heart, most of her friends are half her age.
This book is also dedicated to our father, without whose foresight
and financial support neither of us would have been blessed with
the education and career opportunities that we have had.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
I would like to thank everyone, especially the various healthcare
practitioners whose knowledge, expertise, and experience helped
shape this book. Thanks especially to Dr. Carolyn Dean, MD; Dr.
Colleen Huber, NMD; Raymond Hinish, PharmD, CN; Dr. Michael T.
Murray, ND; Dr. Iljong Kim, MD; and EFT founder Gary Craig for
giving up their valuable time to answer my numerous questions. 
Dr. Huber in particular was more than generous in sharing her vast
knowledge.
Special thanks and much gratitude also to John Hartsell for his
expertise in wordsmithing and his critical eye for detail.
I would like to express my appreciation to my brother and coauthor,
Dr. James Chow, for his share of the work, and for his gift of a
MacBook, which was used in the writing of the manuscript. I also
want to thank the staff of the Nihon Clinic. And last, but certainly
not least, I want to thank my agent Elizabeth Frost-Knappman 
of New England Publishing Associates, and the staff at Wiley
Publishing, in particular Michael Lewis, the acquisitions editor,

Introduction
I
f you pick up this book, chances are you’ve been suffering from
the blues for a long time: the low blood sugar blues, that is. If
you’re hypoglycemic, you know that you don’t have to go to an
amusement park to experience the roller coaster effect; your blood
sugar does it for you automatically, thank you very much. In addi-
tion, you may often get the jitters (especially after a stretch of time
without food), and become nervous, edgy, and irritable. You’re
chronically tired, and you wake up in the morning not feeling the
least bit rested. Or maybe you have other complaints, such as
depression, that just don’t respond to medical treatments — or
any other remedies.
Your colleagues, friends, and family may be tired of your moods,
your chronic fatigue, and your various aches and illnesses, none of
which seems to have a clear, attributable cause. You’ve been to
many doctors. And what do they tell you? They tell you that all the
lab tests have come out “essentially negative.” You’re afraid that
the doctors regard you as neurotic or, at best, a hypochondriac. Or
perhaps you received a clear diagnosis. But now your real strug-
gles begin. No magic pills can instantly cure you.
The good news is that, with a better understanding of hypoglycemia
and the program of recovery outlined in this book, you can regain
your health, your wits, and your sense of humor. And who knows,
you may — depending on your genes and, aside from hypoglycemia,
whatever else may be going on with your body — appreciate life
more than many of your currently enviably healthier brethren.
About This Book
Since the first edition of Hypoglycemia For Dummies came out in
2002, many more studies have been published on how foods affect
your health. Although the basic hypoglycemia diet remains the
same, we know much more than we did about the effect of different
fats on the body. At the same time, more light has been cast on the
dangers of artificial sweeteners and monosodium glutamate (MSG).
When writing this second edition, we hope to provide you, our
readers, with the latest information on the subject of health and
diet. Thus, we expand many chapters, most noticeably Chapter 6,

which tells you what foods to eat and to avoid. You can find many
suggestions on various food substitutes throughout the book; we
also offer tips on how to make the transition to a hypoglycemic
diet. We try to make the book as user-friendly as possible for the
busy reader who’s not only pressed for time, but also has health
issues that may make it more difficult to read or to absorb new
information.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make everything as easy as possible, we use the following basic
conventions to help you:
 We italicize all medical terms and provide an immediate defi-
nition. We also attempt to explain any other words or con-
cepts that may be difficult to understand or may be subject to
misunderstanding.
 We use monofont to identify all Web sites and e-mail
addresses.
 We bold all key words in bulleted lists and all the steps in
numbered lists.
Furthermore, whenever we mention hypoglycemia, unless other-
wise indicated (and we’ll make that amply clear), we mean the
hypoglycemia related to one’s diet — the type that people refer to
when they feel weak from low blood sugar. We use the word recov-
ery because health is an ongoing process, not something that you
can attain with a quick-fix approach. Your challenge is to correct
not only the imbalances of your body but also the way you live,
work, play, and relate to others.
What You’re Not to Read
We have good news for you busy people! You don’t have to read
this book from cover to cover. Of course we want you to read
everything, but we understand that you may want to read just the
essential info. If that’s the case, feel free to skip
 The sidebars. They’re interesting info and appear in the little
gray boxes, but they’re not essential.
 The Library of Congress info. We’re required by law to
include this mumbo jumbo text, but it’s not important to you.

Foolish Assumptions
If you pick up this book, we assume that you
 Suffer from symptoms associated with hypoglycemia (or
someone close to you suffers from the symptoms) and you
want to alleviate the symptoms
 Aren’t a specialist in the medical field (You want just the basic
essential info so you can better grasp your condition.)
 Are aware of the controversy surrounding this syndrome but
accept — or at least suspect — that such a medical problem
indeed exists
How This Book Is Organized
This book has five parts to make navigating easier. It’s a handy ref-
erence for the busy person, because much of the relevant info is
compiled together under one cover for your convenience.

 Taking the road to radiant health
O
ver the years, researchers have coined different names for the
condition that people suffer from when they believe that they
have hypoglycemia, including functional hypoglycemia, relative
hypoglycemia, disinsulinism, hypoglycemic fatigue, and insulino-
genic hypoglycemia. Don’t get too hung up on the names, though.
Your attention should be on regaining your health, not worrying
about what your constellation of symptoms should be called.
No matter what you or your doctor calls your low blood sugar, this
chapter is a great starting point. This chapter gives you the low-
down on hypoglycemia, who’s prone to having it, and what you can
do to make this roller coaster ride not so rough.
Defining Hypoglycemia
Defining hypoglycemia is easy. It’s low (hypo) blood sugar (glycemia).
Modern medicine, or allopathic medicine, which is Western medi-
cine as it’s practiced in developed countries, recognizes two major
categories of hypoglycemia — organic and fasting, which both gen-
erally have clear-cut causes — as legitimate. Other types of hypo-
glycemia, which fall under the category of relative and reactive
hypoglycemia, aren’t usually recognized by mainstream medicine.
It’s still a controversial subject, although some studies indicate
that sensitive people can suffer from hypoglycemic-like symptoms

even when their blood sugar doesn’t drop to a level that’s med-
ically defined as hypoglycemia. (See Chapter 5 on how blood sugar
is measured.)
The diagnosis of idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia, or reactive hypo-
glycemia for short, isn’t universally accepted by allopathic doctors.
This is the type of hypoglycemia that people are referring to when
they complain of being hypoglycemic. Reactive hypoglycemia is
also this book’s focus. In the rest of this book, unless otherwise
stated, we’re talking about reactive hypoglycemia.
But before you get into the rest of the book, take a look at the fol-
lowing sections to discover more about the different types of hypo-
glycemia and see where your symptoms might fall.
Organic
With organic hypoglycemia, your blood sugar level when you’ve
been fasting is invariably low. (The fasting level is the amount of
sugar in your blood after fasting — not eating anything — for 10 to
12 hours.) The symptoms are usually continuous.
This type of hypoglycemia is very rare and may be caused by glan-
dular defects or tumors. If you have organic hypoglycemia, it war-
rants further investigation to determine whether you have an
enlarged pancreas, tumors of the pancreas, or other causes that
are unrelated to what you do or don’t eat.
Relative
Relative hypoglycemia is a condition where your blood sugar
declines from an elevated level to a low level quite rapidly. The
group of people most often misdiagnosed as normal suffer from rel-
ative hypoglycemia. For example, you’re said to have relative
hypoglycemia if
 Your blood sugar falls 20 milligrams (mg) or more below your
fasting level within six hours after eating, and you experience
symptoms.
 Your blood sugar falls 50 mg or more within one hour after
eating, and you experience symptoms.
 During the test that checks your blood sugar level, your blood
sugar increases by 20 mg or less after ingesting the glucose
that you’re given to drink for the test, and then falls to at least
20 mg below your fasting level. (Chapter 5 describes the test
you can take to check your blood sugar level.)

Reactive
Reactive hypoglycemia refers to how your body reacts after you
eat. How high or low does the blood sugar go? With this type of
hypoglycemia, symptoms fluctuate according to the food you eat,
the time of day when you eat, and so on. In reactive hypoglycemia,
the level of sugar in your blood when you’ve been fasting may be
normal or even a little above what’s considered normal. Your body
then overreacts to the glucose in the food you eat by producing
too much insulin, which causes the fall in blood sugar. (That’s why
it’s called reactive.) Even if the blood sugar doesn’t fall below
what’s considered the normal range, a person may experience
symptoms of hypoglycemia if the fall is fast enough.
Many health practitioners don’t differentiate between reactive
hypoglycemia and relative hypoglycemia. They lump the two
together and call it functional hypoglycemia. If you hear this term, it
refers to hypoglycemia that typically occurs because of an imbal-
ance in the body chemistry, probably due to an overactive pan-
creas producing too much insulin.
Fasting hypoglycemia is sometimes classified as being part of func-
tional hypoglycemia. It can occur when you haven’t eaten for a
while. How long that is depends on the individual, but it’s generally
several hours after a meal.
If your doctor uses the term idiopathic postprandial reactive hypo-
glycemia or idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia, he’s talking about reac-
tive hypoglycemia. Idiopathic is just a fancy word that doctors use to
say, “We haven’t got a clue what causes it.” (Now you know how to
profess ignorance and still sound smart!) Postprandial means “after a
meal.” Reactive relates to how your body responds to the food you
eat. Some researchers have proposed the term idiopathic postpran-
dial syndrome because many people who have the signs of reactive
hypoglycemia don’t necessarily have low blood sugar.
If you suffer from reactive hypoglycemia, your body generally
reacts negatively to sugar and simple starches, because it can’t
handle the excess sugar load. You usually start feeling the effect
about 2 to 4 hours after eating “bad” foods.
Like a Greased Pig: Easy to
Define, Tough to Pin Down
Because hypoglycemia is so easy to define, you’d think that deter-
mining who has low blood sugar would be a simple matter. All you
Chapter 1: Riding the Blood Sugar Roller Coaster Isn’t Any Fun 11

should have to do is measure the blood sugar and voilà! — you
have inconvertible proof that someone has hypoglycemia.
Alas, it’s not that cut and dried. Experts disagree on what consti-
tutes a hypoglycemic condition. Today’s standard medical practice
is to consider hypoglycemic levels of blood sugar lower than 45 mg
per deciliter of blood. The benchmark used to be higher, but it has
shifted downward over the years, and doctors still disagree with
one another in terms of finding and diagnosing the condition. For
instance, some health practitioners argue no range of blood sugar
is definitive in determining hypoglycemia; they believe instead that
the speed with which the blood sugar drops is more important
than how low it goes. (Chapter 5 gives you more detailed informa-
tion about diagnoses and measurements.)
And that’s not the only controversy surrounding hypoglycemia.
These bits add to the trouble:
 Symptoms are nonspecific. (You can read more in Chapter 3.)
 Symptoms don’t always correlate with blood glucose (sugar)
concentrations measured during an oral glucose test. (More
on this test in Chapter 5.) The rate at which the blood sugar
drops is just as important, but doctors often ignore this rate.
 Glucose levels are rarely measured when people develop
symptoms spontaneously (not easy to manage unless some-
one follows them around with a syringe).
 Hypoglycemia is a misnomer. Rather than low blood sugar, it’s
more a matter of the body being unable to effectively absorb
certain carbohydrates. Different people react differently to
ingested sugars and carbohydrates, with some having a
higher tolerance level than others. Thus, the condition may
be better described as carbohydrate intolerance or glucose
instability syndrome.
 Many symptoms of hypoglycemia are caused not by the drop
in blood sugar, but by the resulting glandular imbalances. For
example, to counter the emergency created by the blood
sugar falling too low or too rapidly, the body dumps adrena-
line (epinephrine).
In the 1970s, after several books popularized hypoglycemia, many
people jumped on the hypoglycemia bandwagon, and it became an
over-diagnosed condition — a fad disease that most respectable
healthcare practitioners strived to steer clear of. So it’s under-
standable that many doctors are skeptical. It’s also unfortunate,
because they’re unable to help patients who ask “If I’m so healthy,
why do I feel so bad?”
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
12

Although diagnosing hypoglycemia is difficult, you can still work
closely with your doctor to figure out what’s causing your symp-
toms. This section helps you (and your doctor) get a firmer grasp
on your symptoms in order to make the correct diagnosis.
Identifying key symptoms
The symptoms of hypoglycemia aren’t fatal, but they can seriously
detract from the quality of life. The immediate physical symptoms
of low blood sugar are
 Mental confusion (brain fog)
 Inability to think rationally
 Weakness
 Shakiness
These symptoms can be alleviated by eating. The more debilitating
symptoms of chronic hypoglycemia, however, are longer lasting
and not immediately relieved by eating. Chapter 3 talks more about
symptoms and syndromes that are often associated with hypo-
glycemia. We also discuss the various causes of low blood sugar in
people of different age groups.
The link between food and symptoms is undeniable. Face food
facts! This book can help you do that by offering alternatives to the
foods you currently eat. Flip to Chapter 6 for info on the foods you
can and can’t safely eat as a hypoglycemic. If you have a partner
and/or children, flip to Chapter 13 for help on setting up a diet
lifestyle with your family.
Arriving at a diagnosis
Some people may have low blood sugar levels without hypoglycemic
symptoms, while others may have symptoms of hypoglycemia,
even severe ones, even though their blood sugar is within normal
range. Therefore, measuring blood sugar is an unreliable way to
diagnose hypoglycemia. Doctors too often ignore the rate at which
the blood sugar drops, failing to recognize that some patients
develop symptoms when the blood sugar falls quickly.
For these and other reasons, hypoglycemia is often dismissed as
imaginary. Despite the protests of some medical organizations,
many nutritionally oriented physicians, naturopaths, and other
alternative practitioners assert that hypoglycemia is a real clinical
entity. Instead of over-relying on glucose tests, which are often

inaccurate, these health professionals diagnose their patients
through symptoms, and successfully treat the disorder by chang-
ing their patients’ diets. You can read more about these medical
practitioners in Chapter 4.
The best way to diagnose the disorder is through a combination of
various lab tests (which we discuss in detail in Chapter 5) and an
assessment of symptoms (which we discuss in Chapter 3). In addi-
tion, you can try eliminating foods from your diet to see whether
symptoms clear up. As we explain in Chapter 3, food allergies can,
at times, cause hypoglycemia. The food journal we talk about in
Chapter 6 can also help you determine which foods may affect you.
You should see a doctor before you do anything, especially if it’s
been several years since your last physical checkup.
Knowing Who’s Prone
Hypoglycemia can strike anyone at any age. Unlike diabetes, not
enough studies have been performed to create an accurate profile.
Nevertheless, because reactive hypoglycemia can be an early sign
of diabetes, it’s reasonable to believe that hypoglycemics and dia-
betics share a genetic predisposition for metabolic disorders and
similar risks for environmental triggers.
Research suggests that the following people are hypoglycemia’s
likeliest victims:
 Women suffering from premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
 People suffering from severe stress.
 People who are overweight (although some are underweight
due to their faulty carbohydrate metabolism).
 Alcoholics. Some researchers have concluded that alcoholism
is actually an unrecognized problem with body chemistry, and
that all alcoholics are, in fact, hypoglycemics.
This section discusses why hypoglycemia affects certain people
and briefly examines the relationship between hypoglycemia and
diabetes.
Prevailing problem: The pudge!
The sugar and refined carbohydrate-laden diet that the majority of
people in developed countries eat has led to a host of health prob-
lems, and hypoglycemia is one of them.
Chapter 1: Riding the Blood Sugar Roller Coaster Isn’t Any Fun 15

Although most medical and health organizations recommend that
no more than 10 percent of total caloric intake be derived from the
refined sugars added to foods, the fact is that most people in devel-
oped countries eat far more than that (possibly three times that
amount), and despite recommendations, the ideal amount is zero.
And what’s even more alarming is that some lesser-developed
Asian countries are getting a sweet tooth that rivals the richer
nations! Statistics show that the consumption of sugar worldwide
is increasing by 1 to 2 percent every year. Small wonder so many
people have a pudge of a problem.
Like a couple of hooligans: Linking
hypoglycemia and diabetes
You probably know someone who has diabetes. But you may not
know that hypoglycemia and diabetes are linked. Blood sugar
imbalance underlies both disorders. In the case of hypoglycemics,
experts theorize that over a prolonged period of time, too much
insulin (from eating sugar and simple starches) followed by a
blood sugar drop results in cells losing their sensitivity to insulin.
Thus, although hypoglycemia may seem to be the opposite of dia-
betes, it’s, in fact, considered to be a pre-diabetic condition.
Both diabetics and hypoglycemics should treat their condition
through dietary means. The recommended diet for diabetes and
hypoglycemia is, in fact, quite similar — although low blood sugar
sufferers are often advised to reduce their carbohydrate intake, at
least during the early part of treatment. Chapter 3 gives more infor-
mation about diabetes and hypoglycemia and how they’re related.
Chapter 6 gives the scoop about using your diet to your health’s
advantage.
Heading Toward Better Health
A paradigm shift has been taking place in recent years in most
Western countries, as more people are searching for alternative
practices for attaining good health — something that crisis-driven
Western medicine is unable to offer. The new paradigm holds a
high regard for the nutritional basis of disease. The new paradigm,
with its holistic, body-mind approach to health and healing, can
more fully address hypoglycemia’s spectrum of problems. A holis-
tic approach looks at the patient’s entire lifestyle, in addition to
diet, for clues to what’s causing the illness.
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
16

Think of this as a journey toward greater health — a journey of
transformation to a new approach to living and a greater sense of
well-being. In this book, we show you how the transition into a
healthy life can be smooth and not as painful as you may suspect.
The following list shows where you may be starting. If you follow
the physical and food advice given in this book, you can come out
on the other side looking and feeling a whole lot better.
 Not eating right — right now: You should be eating six small
meals, or three small meals and three light snacks, per day,
although you may eat more frequently if you need to when
you first embark on the program. This diet is very similar to a
diabetic diet and doesn’t include sweets or sugars.
If you want healthy recipes, the Internet is a great source.
Plenty of good diabetes cookbooks exist as well, including the
Diabetic Cookbook For Dummies, by Alan L. Rubin, MD, Alison
G. Acerra, RD, and Chef Denise Sharf (Wiley). You can safely
follow any recipes created for diabetics as long as you refrain
from using artificial sweeteners.
People are often surprisingly uninformed regarding diets and
facts about hypoglycemia. Chapter 15 sets the record straight
on commonly held misperceptions.
 Overweight: For various reasons, low blood sugar can lead to
weight gain. One reason is that you may be giving in to an
increased desire for sweets; Chapter 8 can help get you moti-
vated to get moving. In addition, overeating sweets and
starches overstimulates insulin production, and too much
insulin causes excess storage of fat.
 Underweight: You may have been gorging yourself on sugars
and starches in a futile attempt to gain weight. (And evoking
jealousy among your friends in the process.) If so, addressing
your underlying metabolism disorder can help you put on the
pounds that you want and need.
 Combating depression and mood disorders: When Abraham
Lincoln said, “People are as happy as they make up their
minds to be,” little knowledge existed about the basics of
depression. (Ironically, evidence suggests that Lincoln himself
was a generally depressed person, who never did fully “make
up his mind” to be happy. Could he have suffered from hypo-
glycemia? Or an associated condition?) Chapter 10 talks more
about depression.
 Lacking a solid support structure: When you have a condi-
tion that undermines your effectiveness in daily life and chips
Chapter 1: Riding the Blood Sugar Roller Coaster Isn’t Any Fun 17

away at your confidence and self-esteem, you need a bridge.
The support structure that you create for yourself is this
bridge. (See? It’s all up to you: Not only are you responsible
for food and exercise, but finding support is all about you, too.)
A support person or group can help guide you through, espe-
cially when you’re just beginning your recovery program.
Chapter 12 tells you how to get the support you need. In addi-
tion, we give you plenty of online resources that can help you.
Every individual is so different that predicting a time frame of
recovery is difficult, but in general, you should start to see a
noticeable improvement in your health in about three months.
Having an occasional bad food day won’t negate your progress —
but don’t kid yourself. Going off your food plan for several days,
not to mention weeks, will definitely impede your progress.

Digesting Hypoglycemia:
Your Body’s Role
In This Chapter
 Looking at what happens when you eat
 Examining potential causes of hypoglycemia
 Breaking the cycle: How too much sugar can lead to low blood sugar
B
efore you can completely understand hypoglycemia and how
it affects your body, you first need to know how and why
some individuals develop hypoglycemia. You needn’t get a medical
degree, but knowing some sweet and simple facts about sugar and
how the body strives to maintain blood sugar equilibrium can
most definitely help you take a proactive role in making sure that
you won’t have to suffer again from not having enough sugar in
your bloodstream to fuel you properly.
In this chapter, we don’t rhapsodize about the marvel of engineer-
ing that is the human body. We tell it like it is so that you know the
hormonal basics that take place whenever you chow down. That
way you can understand why diet is the cornerstone of treatment
for a hypoglycemic.
Absorbing Some Physical Food
Generally, a meal provides nutrients that reach your body over a
span of about four hours. However, your cells demand nutrients
around the clock. (They were the first to demand 24/7 service.)
Digestion begins in your mouth — this is why your parents and
other well-meaning people tell you to chew your food — and con-
tinues in your stomach. Your body has to break down the food
before it can use the nutrients. The process is complex and can be

a mouthful to describe in just a few words. This section breaks
down the way your body digests food to help you better digest 
the info.
Breaking down proteins
When you bite into your favorite food (or even those lima beans
you’re eating because your mom taught you well), your digestive
system is starting to work. The following steps show how your
body breaks down proteins, beginning with that first nibble.
G’head, take a bite:
1. Saliva comes into contact with food.
The salivary enzymes in the mouth partially break down
some of the starch into a simple sugar called glucose.
Glucose is the sugar in your bloodstream; it’s also your
body’s energy source.
2. Your body recognizes any alien proteins and breaks
them down into basic amino acids.
Amino acids are molecular units that make up all proteins.
For an example of an alien protein, think of steak. Steak is
composed of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. The protein
in the steak is in the form of beef protein, which doesn’t do
you a whole lot of good if you’re a Homo sapien. (We pre-
sume you are, because you’re reading this book, but if
you’re not — well, we’ve heard of stranger things!) Why?
Because it has to be converted into human protein before
your body can use it.
3. Your body reconstructs some of the amino acids into
human protein.
That protein is now available for growth, repair, and other
vital physical functions.
4. Some of the amino acids become human carbohydrates,
which are converted into basic sugars: glycogen and 
glucose.
Glycogen is the sugar your body stores, mostly in the liver
but also in muscle tissue. Hundreds of branches stick out
from glycogen, and on each branch is glucose, which is
attached to the next glucose. All are readily accessible to
the glycogen-splitting enzymes.
Your body normally converts excess glucose to glycogen 
or fatty acids. If you’re in the fasting state, however, the 
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
20

triacylglycerols (fat stores) and amino acids produce glu-
cose. Glycogen isn’t produced. The fasting state is reached
many hours after you’ve eaten, when the body has com-
pletely absorbed all the nutrients from the last food con-
sumed. When the body reaches a fasting state, your body
meets its energy needs by turning to nutrients that are
stored in the body.
5. The liver converts some of the excess energy into fat.
Excess fat is stored in the fat cells to meet long-term energy
needs.
Pancreas plays its part
After your liver converts excess energy into fat, your pancreas
begins its work. The pancreas is an organ that
 Manufactures enzymes to digest food
 Manufactures bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid
 Manufactures glucagon, a protein hormone that stimulates the
release of glucose into the blood
 Secretes insulin when alerted that you’re eating carbs (Insulin
is a powerful hormone that, among other things, chaperones
the glucose to the body’s cells, instructing the cells to take in
the glucose. That’s critical, because glucose is your body’s
fuel. For more info on insulin, check out the nearby sidebar,
“What’s in insulin?”)
Carbohydrates are basically chains of sugar molecules. The carbs
you eat are mostly chains of glucose molecules. The shorter the
chain, the sweeter the taste. Some chains are longer and more
complicated, having many links and even branches. Hence, short
chains are known as simple carbohydrates, and longer ones as com-
plex carbohydrates. Simple or complex, carbs are composed
entirely of sugar.
If the blood delivers more glucose than the cells can take in, the
liver and muscles take up the surplus.
Here’s what happens to the excess glucose:
 The muscles hog two-thirds of the body’s total store of glucose.
 The liver stores the other third and makes it available when
the brain or other organs need to draw on the supply.
Chapter 2: Digesting Hypoglycemia: Your Body’s Role 21

The following shows how the pancreas helps regulate your blood
sugar level:
1. You eat a meal, and insulin becomes the dominant hor-
mone in your body.
2. Insulin is suppressed four to six hours later when
glucagon shows up.
Glucagon shows up as your metabolism shifts gears.
Glucagon suppresses insulin by releasing glucose into 
the blood.
• When blood glucose levels drop too low, the pancreas
releases glucagon.
• Suppression of the insulin allows the liver to release
glucose.
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
22
What’s in insulin?
The pancreas releases insulin directly into the bloodstream to regulate the level of
glucose (sugar) in the blood. Cells can’t use glucose for energy or nourishment with-
out insulin, which is why insulin is critical to animal and human life. Without insulin,
organisms quickly die.
Insulin transports the glucose from the blood into the body’s cells. It forces the liver
and muscle cells to store glucose in the form of glycogen. When insulin levels are
lower, the liver cells convert glycogen to glucose and excrete it into the blood.
Conversely, when insulin is released, glucose in the blood is decreased. If the level
of glucose is too low, the person suffers from hypoglycemia. By definition, you have
hypoglycemia if your blood sugar is too low. (Flip to Chapter 1 for a definition of hypo-
glycemia.)
Within the body is a constant interplay of hormones that affects the level of glucose
in the blood. For instance, during periods of stress, the body releases the stress hor-
mones epinephrine and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which inhibit the release of
insulin and increase hepatic glycolysis, the conversion of glycogen to glucose in
the liver, thereby increasing the level of glucose available for energy.
Insulin has numerous other effects on cells, such as increased fatty acid synthe-
sis. Insulin forces fat cells to take in blood lipids (fatty acids). The lack of insulin
causes the reverse — a reduction in the uptake of blood fatty acids by cells. A
reduction can mean less available energy. Other effects of insulin include increased
amino acid and potassium uptake.

3. As long as the blood glucose levels are within normal
range, insulin regulates glucose metabolism.
If the blood glucose level dips too low, counter-regulatory
hormones (hormones that oppose insulin’s action) are
released.
Insulin stores the glucose in the liver and muscle cells, and
glucagon removes it from storage as needed.
Insulin gone awry
In order for your body’s check-and-balance mechanism to work
properly, the demand for insulin must subside at times. Assume
this nasty scenario:
1. You repeatedly chow down on snacks high in sugar and
starch.
2. Your body has to constantly pump out insulin.
As a result, your body has too much insulin!
3. The insulin receptors on the cells lose some of their 
sensitivity.
4. The pancreas secretes more insulin, hoping to get the
receptors to respond.
Now you have way too much insulin!
5. Insulin rounds up the glucose from the bloodstream and
drives it into the cells.
The result is hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. (Doctors
who don’t believe that hypoglycemia exists in so-called
healthy people — in other words, nondiabetic people —
would argue that hypoglycemia can’t occur as just
described.)
6. The insulin receptors become desensitized, and insulin
can’t deliver enough glucose into the cells.
The result is a condition known as insulin resistance. See
Chapter 3 for more on this condition and its link to 
hypoglycemia.
7. Eventually, more sugar remains in the bloodstream.
The result is type 2 diabetes.
Chapter 2: Digesting Hypoglycemia: Your Body’s Role 23

This list is an admittedly oversimplified picture and just one sce-
nario that can cause hypoglycemia in people who are genetically
susceptible. (Check out the next section for more on the causes.)
The point to remember is that when a person who’s sensitive to
carbs (see Chapter 3 for more) eats carbs, the blood sugar
increases more rapidly than it should. This situation results in a
rapid rise and fall in both insulin and blood sugar levels.
Bear in mind that carbs make up only part of the foods that directly
affect blood sugar levels. Protein and fats are slowly absorbed, so
the sensitive insulin apparatus is less likely to be triggered. Thus,
small, regular meals consisting of protein or fats and some carbs
keep the blood sugar stable, preventing sudden rises and falls in
glucose.
Now you can appreciate what a complex dance the chemicals and
hormones have to perform in order to keep your blood sugar level
within a narrow range. The picture isn’t yet complete, however.
The process includes more dancers and more steps, as you see
later in this chapter.
Tracing Cause and Effect
Hypoglycemia has many causes, some of which aren’t related to
what you eat, but this section only briefly covers them. Just remem-
ber that hypoglycemia treatment depends totally on the underly-
ing medical illnesses. So go see your doctor first — don’t diagnose
yourself!
Multiple causes
Numerous factors can cause hypoglycemia, some of which are too
technical for a lengthy discussion in this book. However, we do
want to at least briefly tell you about the potential causes. You can
check with your doctor for more scientific details.
The following are some of the causes of hypoglycemia:
 Genes: In some patients, low blood sugar occurs mainly
because of a defect in glucose production, while in others, the
problem is the result of an excessive use of glucose. Some-
times the low blood sugar level is the result of both reasons.
 An underlying medical illness: Although it’s a matter of
debate, most doctors argue that hypoglycemia doesn’t occur
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
24

without an underlying medical illness that’s unrelated to what
you eat. When a patient has no organic causes for hypo-
glycemia, the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) is likely
involved. It appears that insulin can stimulate epinephrine
release in some sensitive people.
 Profound malnutrition: If you’re severely deficient in nutri-
tion, you’re at risk for hypoglycemia because you don’t have
enough glucose in your blood.
 Prolonged exercise: Exercising intensely for too long without
eating causes hypoglycemia because the body uses up the
sugar that’s stored in your liver.
 Late pregnancy: Some women may experience hypoglycemia
in late pregnancy as the result of a drop in glucose production.
 Severe liver deficiency: Liver deficiencies, such as glycogen
storage disease in which the body lacks enzymes responsible
for forming glycogen, result in the body not being able to pro-
duce enough glucose in the blood.
 Liver diseases: These diseases include viral hepatitis and cir-
rhosis. Any kind of liver disease may result in a drop in blood
glucose levels, because the liver stores glucose (as glycogen).
The body taps into the glucose reserve in the liver for more
sugar, but if the liver is diseased, it can’t properly convert
glycogen to glucose.
People often suffer from many of the symptoms of hypoglycemia
even when their blood sugar isn’t particularly low. The term pseudo-
hypoglycemia refers to the symptoms of hypoglycemia that occur
without low blood sugar.
Exhausting your adrenals
It’s 11 p.m. Do you know where your adrenals are? Hopefully they’re
tucked away all safe and sound in bed. Seriously, if you reply that
the adrenals are located above your kidneys, you’re absolutely cor-
rect. The adrenals, which are no bigger than a walnut, rise up kind
of like mushrooms from the top of each kidney and are intimately
involved with normal blood sugar regulation — very important for
the glycemically challenged person.
The hormones these little guys secrete influence all the major
physiological processes in the body. For starters, they affect how
the body uses carbs and fats, converts fats and proteins into
energy, and distributes stored fat. (Remember that the next time
you’re in a bathing suit.)
Chapter 2: Digesting Hypoglycemia: Your Body’s Role 25

Some researchers even believe that excessive stress is what’s
mostly responsible for common hypoglycemic symptoms. You may
wonder how stress can have anything to do with blood sugar. The
following shows you how that happens:
1. You bounce the mortgage check, one of the kids gets the
flu, and the cat barfs on your new bedspread.
Now that’s what we call stress. (Or your average Monday.)
2. Your adrenals work too hard and become fatigued from
too much stress.
The adrenals react to any situation that they believe to be
an emergency by secreting the hormone adrenaline. In the
not-so-good-old-days, the fight-or-flight response was trig-
gered when a Neanderthal man saw a rabid buffalo charg-
ing at him. More adrenaline was pumped into his
bloodstream to get him ready to either fight the creature or
flee. Today an emergency is more likely to be a car that
cuts you off or a customer who calls you names.
3. Cortisol levels drop lower than normal.
The adrenal hormone cortisol keeps blood sugar at ade-
quate levels. A low level of cortisol makes maintaining
normal blood sugar levels pretty tough. If your adrenals are
sluggish, your liver is slow to convert glycogen to glucose.
Normally, your body can convert fats, proteins, and carbs
into glucose, but this process is more difficult when the
adrenals are fatigued. In this situation, one of the blood
sugar glitches can arise.
4. Your liver has difficulty converting glycogen back to 
glucose.
Glycogen, or stored sugar, has to be converted into glucose
(blood sugar) before the body can use it. When your liver
has difficulty converting glycogen to glucose, less blood
sugar is available, and your brain is deprived of fuel. When
your brain isn’t getting enough sugar, you can develop
hypoglycemic symptoms, such as lightheadedness and 
disorientation.
Ravaging your health: The couch
and the potato
In the not-so-distant past, you may have been programmed to think
that carbs were not only delectable but also good for you. In more
recent years, you may have gotten the impression that carbs are
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
26

the root of all evil. The truth, as usual, is somewhere in between.
Carbs are the most efficient fuel for the body to use, and the brain
can use only sugar for its primary fuel. That may sound as if every-
one should benefit from eating mega doses of carbs. But if you
suffer from hypoglycemia, it may well be that your body has diffi-
culty handling too much carbs. Even complex carbohydrates like
whole grains can be problematic if your body doesn’t metabolize
carbs properly.
Burp. You’ve eaten your fill; you’re stuffed to the gill. You’re lying
contentedly on the couch, remote in hand, relaxing after a hard
day of work. Well, you may be at rest, but check this out:
1. Your digestive tract is busier than the pizza man. It’s
delivering glucose to the bloodstream.
2. The blood carries this glucose to your liver.
3. The liver breaks the glucose down into small fragments
and puts them together into the more permanent energy
storage compound — in other words, fat.
4. The fat is released into the blood, carried to the body’s
fatty tissues, and deposited there.
Unlike the liver cells, which can store only about half a
day’s supply of glycogen, the fat cells — much to the cha-
grin of dieters — can store unlimited quantities of fat.
You can find out how fast carbs become glucose and enter the
bloodstream by checking out the glycemic index (GI) of food. (See
Chapter 6 for more on this topic.)
Sugar, sugar, everywhere — 
except where you need it
Sugar. Honey. Sweetie-pie. Terms of endearment reflect the desir-
ability of sweet tastes. Sugar is surprisingly prevalent in dishes you
may least suspect: soups, cured meats, salad dressings, and
sauces, for example. One tablespoon of regular ketchup contains a
teaspoon of sugar. Hoisin sauce, which you often find in Chinese
cooking, has just as much sugar, if not more. A can of soda pop
contains several tablespoons of sugar. Even diet foods contain
large amounts of rapidly acting carbohydrates or alternative
sweeteners like aspartame (which has been linked to cancer).
If you’re surrounded by sugar, how can anyone possibly be suffer-
ing from low blood sugar? That’s precisely the point. Because
everything is so sugar-laden, keeping a steady level of blood sugar
Chapter 2: Digesting Hypoglycemia: Your Body’s Role 27

has become difficult. If someone is suffering from low blood sugar,
it doesn’t mean that she should eat sugar. This statement may, at
first, appear to be a contradiction. The paradox is that the more
sugar you eat, the less sugar you have in your blood.
Your body can easily obtain the blood sugar it needs to function
through unrefined carbs, protein, and fats. The truth is that even if
you eat absolutely no glucose or refined sugar, you’ll still have
plenty of blood sugar as long as your body is functioning properly.
Chapter 6 explains why refined carbs are harmful, but unrefined
carbs are okay.
Addressing Addictions: The Link 
to Low Blood Sugar
A sweet link may exist between various forms of addictions and
low blood sugar. The connection may lie in feel-good hormones
called beta-endorphins, which are produced in the opioid system,
the reward pathway of the brain. Scientists are now working with
the hypothesis that the presence of beta-endorphins in the reward
pathway regions in the brain is key to the development of addic-
tion to opioids like heroin. Beta-endorphins give you a feeling of
euphoria, or a sense of being on top of the world.
Not surprisingly, other things can offer such addictive relation-
ships to varying degrees. The following may help you kick your
own bad habits:
 Saying sayonara to the sauce: The fact is, alcohol is a simple
carb that’s rapidly converted into sugar. It creates an addic-
tive high that’s quickly followed by a low. Hypoglycemia in
alcoholics usually occurs after a several-day alcohol binge or
in a malnourished state, which causes glycogen depletion in
the liver and blocks glucose synthesis.
Most treatment programs emphasize psychological factors
and neglect possible biochemical deficiencies and body chem-
istry. Many problems attributed to an alcoholic’s personality
or life history may actually be caused by faulty body chem-
istry. If you’re working toward a recovery from drinking, try
addressing both your body (with dietary changes like those
suggested in Chapter 6) and your mind (with support from
groups like AA).
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
28

 Conquering the carb crave: Always craving the carbo rush? If
so, you may be
• Getting less protein than you need
• Seeing an early warning sign that your stress level is 
too high (Chapter 9 shows you how to lower the boom
on stress)
• Eating an out-of-balance diet
• Unconsciously using self-medication to lift your mood
 Kicking caffeine in the coffeemaker: Caffeine has an effect
similar to sugar, although the results may not be so immedi-
ate. It triggers the release of stored glycogen to temporarily
increase the blood sugar level. Chapter 11 offers ideas on how
to kick your addiction to caffeine. Be aware that when you
drink sugared, caffeinated drinks, you’re essentially getting a
double whammy in terms of a sugar rush! But don’t be so
quick to switch to diet sodas — they’re not any better,
because recent studies show that the artificial sweeteners
used are damaging to your health. The solution? Kick your
soda habit!
 Knocking out nicotine: Enough has been said about the bad
effects of cigarettes and other tobacco products. But are you
aware of the effect that nicotine has on blood sugar? Light up
a cigarette and ping! You just boosted your blood sugar. You
suddenly feel euphoric. Why? Because nicotine stimulates the
adrenal glands. Unfortunately, smoking creates a desire for
caffeine, sweet foods, and alcohol.
Start by adjusting your diet and taking the necessary supple-
ments (which we describe in Chapter 7). Hypnosis, medita-
tion, and breathing techniques may also help (see Chapter 9).
If you continue to smoke, even if you follow the correct diet,
you may not notice an improvement in symptoms because
adrenal stimulation from the nicotine is constantly triggering
the release of glucose into the blood — and the sugar spike is
rapidly followed by a crash.

 Examining the link between hypoglycemia and diabetes
H
aving hypoglycemia certainly isn’t more fun than a barrel full
of monkeys — but sometimes you may feel like monkeys are
running around, keeping your mind edgy and unfocused. At times
you may feel cold, anxious, or nervous; or you may be so down
and depressed that you’re virtually digging in the ditches. (If that’s
the case, check out Chapter 10.) Then, before you know it, your
heart is racing so fast that you’d think you were running from a
herd of elephants. Meanwhile, you’re experiencing memory loss;
it’s getting so that you can’t remember what you’ve forgotten.
If you often experience these symptoms, you may have chronic
hypoglycemia. Or not. Determining whether you have this disorder
can be downright confusing, because the symptoms mimic so many
other illnesses. This chapter clarifies the muddy waters. (For infor-
mation about getting a proper medical diagnosis from a doctor,
turn to Chapter 5.) This chapter also makes clear the connection
between diabetes and hypoglycemia.
Jumping on Stage: No, You’re 
Not Faking It
Nothing’s clear cut about hypoglycemia. Why would its stages be
any different? Generally speaking, doctors can detect two basic
stages. Each stage can last anywhere from weeks to years, depend-
ing on the individual and the underlying cause. In fact, though,
these stages aren’t so clear-cut. They may come and go, and they
can possibly overlap.

 Stage 1: Depression, fatigue, lethargy, poor concentration, and
memory loss
 Stage 2: Agitation, fast heartbeat, cold and clammy hands,
and possibly full-blown panic attacks
That’s the fun part. The not-so-fun part is that most people are going
to label you a hypochondriac. As far as they’re concerned, the prob-
lem’s all in your mind. And no wonder; hypoglycemia has just too
many darn symptoms. (For more information on talking about the
disorder with those you know and love, check out Chapters 13 and
14.) When confronted with the long list of nonspecific complaints
that hypoglycemics generally present, many doctors may be tempted
to dismiss it as hogwash. (That’s the medical term for “I’d rather
scrub Porky Pig in a tub than deal with this.”) Don’t let the doctor’s
diagnosis deter you. Find a doctor or healthcare practitioner who
truly understands hypoglycemia. (See Chapter 4.)
If you suspect that you may have hypoglycemia, get a proper
checkup to rule out other causes for your symptoms. The kind of
chronic hypoglycemia we talk about in this book may be disabling,
but it’s not fatal. If something else is causing your low blood sugar,
you can end up harming yourself by not getting proper treatment.
(See “Unmasking Hypoglycemia’s Hidden Faces” later in this chap-
ter for various causes of hypoglycemia.)
Eying the Physical Symptoms
If you’re like most people with hypoglycemia, you wake up feeling
tired and exhausted, and your body may feel achy. You may not
feel good in the morning, but you usually feel much better in the
evening. (Generally, people have higher levels of blood sugar in the
evening.)
The long and short of it is that a long list of physical symptoms is
classically attributed to hypoglycemia. When checking out this list,
look for a group of symptoms that persist over time.
Here are just some of the symptoms associated with hypoglycemia:
 Accident prone
 Hot flashes
 Aching eye sockets
 Chronic indigestion
 Backache and muscle pain
 Internal trembling
 Bad breath
 Itching, crawling skin 
sensations
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
32

 Blurred vision
 Joint pain
 Chatterbox (talking a lot)
 Muscular twitching 
or cramps
 Chronically cold 
 Numbness
hands and feet
 Convulsions
 Obesity
 Dizziness
 Premenstrual symptoms
 Drowsiness
 Ringing in ears
 Fainting or blackouts
 Sensitivity to light and noise
 Family history of diabetes 
 Excessive sighing 
or low blood sugar
and yawning
 Fatigue or exhaustion
 Difficulty sleeping
 Headaches
 Excessive sweating
 Heart palpitations
How many of these symptoms do you have? If you’ve experienced
a few or more, congratulations: It proves that you’re not the living
dead. Everyone is bound to have some of these symptoms at some
time. If you have a few, especially of short duration, don’t worry.
Even if you experience the symptoms fairly regularly, other condi-
tions may be causing them. For instance, hot flashes may be due to
the fact that you’re a female of a certain age. And as for itching and
crawling sensations on the skin — don’t look now, but there’s a
spider on your arm. Not everything under the sun can be blamed
on low blood sugar.
Some symptoms can indicate a serious problem. See a doctor
immediately if you experience dizziness, numbness, fainting, or
convulsions.
Identifying the Emotional
Symptoms
People tend to behave in a bizarre manner when their tanks are
running on empty (or when their blood glucose is low). You can’t
run without fuel, and you accept that. So how can you expect your
brain to work without the proper fuel — and in the case of that
hefty gray matter (which we describe further in Chapter 2), the
fuel of choice is glucose. Starve your poor brain and you may have
bizarre behavioral symptoms that can look like dementia, para-
noia, or even schizophrenia.
Chapter 3: Symptoms without a Cause 33

Here’s an extensive (but by no means complete) list of mental
symptoms that can be induced by hypoglycemia:
 Antisocial behavior
 Lack of sex drive
 Circular thinking
 Low tolerance for stress
 Constant worrying
 Mental confusion 
(brain fog)
 Difficulty in concentration
 Moodiness
 Emotional fragility
 Negative thoughts 
and attitudes
 Exhaustion
 Nervousness
 Feeling on edge
 Night terrors, nightmares
 Feelings of going 
 Phobias
mad or insane
 Feelings of inadequacy
 Restlessness
 Forgetfulness
 Suicidal thoughts 
or tendencies
 Indecisiveness
 Temper tantrums
 Irritability
Of course, everyone experiences some of these emotional states at
some time or other. (If you’re convinced that you don’t, ask your

34
PMS? Yes!
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is often associated with increased appetite, a crav-
ing for sweets, headaches, fatigue, and heart palpitations — in fact, all the symp-
toms of hypoglycemia. It’s no wonder. Glucose tolerance tests given to premenstrual
subjects showed excess insulin in response to sugar consumption. It appears that
women who suffer from PMS have incidents of hypoglycemia that correlate with
their menstrual cycles.
If you’re a woman who has experienced PMS, you know that you often crave some-
thing sweet and simple, such as sugar and flour, just before your period. It’s the low
blood sugar talking. Most women who devour sugar and simple starches experi-
ence stress, anxiety, and moodiness just before their periods — 80 to 90 percent of
the sugar eaters, according to some research. The problem is easily rectified by
changing your diet. Try to follow the diet recommended for hypoglycemics (see
Chapter 6), especially when you feel an attack of PMS coming on.

loved ones: They’ll tell you otherwise!) What you should look out
for are regular and extended bouts with these symptoms. By fol-
lowing the dietary guidelines and keeping a food journal like the
one we discuss in Chapter 6, you can make correlations to the
foods, moods, and behaviors that affect you. If you suffer from
nightmares, night sweats, or sleeplessness, check out the nearby
sidebar, “Snacking before bed: It’s a go.”
Seek professional help immediately if you experience suicidal
thoughts/tendencies or mental confusion.
Unmasking Hypoglycemia’s
Hidden Faces
It may seem as though hypoglycemia is blamed for just about
every condition under the sun. Maybe the stock market dive will
eventually be attributed to low blood sugar. (The idea isn’t as far-
fetched as you may think. During the “bubble economy,” some
people speculated that the skyrocketing economy was caused in
part by investors feeling terribly optimistic after taking Prozac.)
What’s confounding about hypoglycemia is that practically every one
of its symptoms can be caused by other pathological conditions —
diseases and illnesses that have other causes. If you’re suffering
from symptoms that are suggestive of hypoglycemia, one of the fol-
lowing may be true:
Chapter 3: Symptoms without a Cause 35
Snacking before bed: It’s a go
Insulin regulation plays a role in your sleeping habits. If you’re prone to low blood
sugar, you may often have nightmares, night sweats, and sleeplessness. When you
go without eating for many hours during the night, your blood glucose can plunge.
This plunge in blood glucose levels dropkicks your adrenals into gear. Your adren-
als then release adrenaline as a secondary energy source. Because adrenaline is
a stimulatory hormone, it keeps you from having a sound, peaceful sleep.
To avoid the effects of adrenaline, have a light snack just before going to bed. Yogurt
and cottage cheese are good choices. If you have a weight problem, make sure that
the snack isn’t something that’s high in calories. Remember, you don’t need to eat
a lot — and avoid foods, such as simple starches, that will cause your body to pro-
duce too much insulin.

 Hypoglycemia may be the hidden cause. In other words, you
have these symptoms because you have hypoglycemia.
 The hypoglycemic symptom may indicate a different illness.
The symptoms you have are the result of a different condition,
not hypoglycemia.
 Hypoglycemia is paired with another condition. You have two
conditions, one of which is hypoglycemia. In these cases,
hypoglycemia may lead to the other condition, or the other
condition may lead to hypoglycemia. Or, in some cases, you
may be suffering from more than one syndrome in addition to
hypoglycemia. Sorting everything becomes terribly difficult.
You can safely follow virtually the same, basic hypoglycemic diet —
with perhaps some modifications based on individual needs and
circumstances — regardless of whether you suffer from one or
more of the other syndromes we discuss in the following sections.
But if you see little or no improvement in your condition after sev-
eral months of following a hypoglycemic diet (see Chapter 6), you
may need to get more specific treatment for your other conditions,
including fine-tuning your diet. In this case, follow the guidance of
an experienced health practitioner.
You don’t have to worry about harming yourself by following a hypo-
glycemic diet. It’s a safe and sound way of eating. Unlike fad diets, the
hypoglycemic diet can only improve your health, not hurt it.
Untangling what’s caused by what can be quite tricky, because the
symptoms can overlap. For example, persistent fatigue, mood dis-
orders, and brain dysfunctions, such as impaired memory and con-
centration — all hallmarks of hypoglycemia — are also symptoms
of hypothyroidism and chronic fatigue syndrome. We can’t cover
every single condition related to hypoglycemia, but the following
sections discuss a few of the major ones.
Reactions to food
If your doctor mentions food reactions, she’s not talking about
your food likes and dislikes. She’s referring to allergies, tolerances,
or sensitivities to certain foods. When you’re allergic or sensitive
to a food, eating it provokes a reaction, such as a rash or hives.
Even if you’re not truly allergic to a substance, your body may still
react to it. For instance, have you ever eaten at a Chinese restaurant
and hours later experienced headaches, nausea, dizziness, and other
uncomfortable symptoms? It could be a reaction to monosodium glu-
tamate (MSG), which is used in many Chinese dishes.
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
36

Food allergy
A food allergy is an adverse reaction of your body’s immune system
to a food. A true allergy, as defined by medicine, shows a certain
level of immune cells or antibodies on blood tests. An allergic
response is usually immediate. The reaction can range from mild to
serious, and is sometimes even life-threatening.
People are most often allergic to milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy,
wheat, fish, and shellfish. Alternative practitioners of integrative
medicine recognize a broader definition of allergies that includes
delayed reaction to foods.
Food intolerance
A food intolerance is an inability to properly digest various foods
due to lack of certain enzymes in your body. The best known exam-
ple is lactose intolerance. A lactose intolerant person can’t drink
milk without getting an unpleasant reaction.
Food sensitivity
Food sensitivity is a catch-all term that’s often used to cover any
adverse food reactions. You can be sensitive to foods without suf-
fering from an allergy or a food intolerance. Food sensitivities can
show up as physical, mental, or emotional symptoms. Reactions
are usually delayed; they may occur days or even weeks after you
eat the offending food. Symptoms, such as sinus congestion,
asthma, and headaches, may linger and recur.
Some researchers suspect that food sensitivities may be impli-
cated in hypoglycemia — as well as a host of other conditions,
including depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, candidiasis,
fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and so forth.
Food sensitivities may affect the brain and the central nervous
system, resulting in various syndromes. For example, chronic food
intolerances may lead to anxiety, irritability, and hyperactivity in
both adults and children. Sensitivities aren’t restricted to just food.
If you’re susceptible to food sensitivities, you may experience toxic
reactions to chemicals and pollutants in the environment as well.
These irritants include pesticides, carpeting, bleach, food color-
ings, and food additives, to name just a few.
Western, allopathic doctors may scoff at the notion that food reac-
tions could be responsible for such a wide array of conditions. But
many sufferers assert that they’ve found relief from symptoms by
eliminating offending foods or substances.
Chapter 3: Symptoms without a Cause 37

Coping with food reactions
If you suspect that you may be reacting adversely to certain foods,
then by all means keep a food journal. Chapter 6 tells you how.
After keeping a record for two to three weeks, review your journal.
Do you detect a pattern? Do you find a correlation between your
symptoms and certain foods? You may find that you’re sensitive to
foods that you often crave or eat frequently (if you commonly
crave bread or pasta, check out the nearby sidebar “Glutton for
gluten”). Try eliminating the suspected foods for at least five days
to see whether your symptoms clear.
Not sure where to start? Go on an elimination diet by trying the fol-
lowing for two weeks:
 Remove the most common offenders — milk, eggs, peanuts,
tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish.
 Remove corn and citrus foods; some people are bothered by
these foods.
 Consume only vegetables and boiled or broiled meat.
 Consume fresh fruits if your system can handle them.
 Drink plenty of water.
 Continue keeping your food journal.
At the end of the trial, add one food at a time back into your diet.
Eat this food for four days. Be sure to note in your food journal any
reactions to the food (check out Chapter 6 for more on keeping a
journal). Repeat the process with each food that you eliminated.
When symptoms return after reintroducing a certain food, then
you’ve likely identified a culprit.
After you identify offending foods, stop consuming them. Most
people start feeling better quite rapidly. You may find that after a
long period of abstaining from a particular food, you can eat it with
no problem. The method we describe here requires time, planning,
and effort, but it also has benefits; for example, this method
 Is regarded as one of the best ways of ferreting out food 
intolerances
 Costs much less than getting tests for food sensitivities, which
can be quite expensive and not necessarily any more accurate
 Helps you become better acquainted with your body’s 
unique needs
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
38

If at any time you start to experience severe reactions, such as
vomiting, wheezing, or a swollen throat, stop self-testing and con-
sult an allergist at once.
Overlapping syndromes
Teasing out different symptoms is rather like trying to untangle a
ball of yarn. A lot of syndromes overlap. This situation is particu-
larly true of fibromyalgia, candidiasis, and chronic fatigue syn-
drome, which share so many symptoms.
Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a disorder that affects mostly
women. The cause is still unknown. Patients typically suffer from
Chapter 3: Symptoms without a Cause 39
Glutton for gluten
Do you crave breads, pasta, and other wheat-based products? If so, you may have
a gluten sensitivity or allergy. Gluten is the protein that’s in wheat, rye, barley, and
perhaps oats as well. (Oats don’t contain gluten, but because they’re handled by
the same mills that process wheat, barley, and rye, they may be contaminated with
gluten. So avoid oats unless you buy them from companies that provide non-con-
taminated oats.) Gluten may be the most common food intolerance. Considering that
you can find it in such all-time favorite foods as bread, pasta, cakes, cookies, and
pizza crust, you can see that gluten sensitivity can be a serious problem.
This info may sound paradoxical, but people with food intolerances may actually
crave the very food that their body is unable to handle. The more you crave it, the
more you eat it, and the more havoc it plays in your system.
A genetic disorder called celiac disease, which results in damage to the intestine,
may be at the root of gluten intolerance in some people. Celiac disease can pro-
voke a complex range of different reactions, not all of them digestive issues like gas,
diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain. Symptoms may also include impaired
brain function, depression, joint pain, and fatigue. The disease can’t be cured, but
it can be managed by simply avoiding gluten.
Although only a small minority of people is diagnosed with this disease, suffering
from some degree of gluten sensitivity without actually having celiac disease is pos-
sible. If you’re one of these people, you can dramatically improve your health by
eliminating all gluten from your diet. As an added bonus, the gluten-free diet is highly

fatigue, irritability, nervousness, depression, anxiety, sleep disorder,
and cognitive and memory impairment. Fibromyalgia patients can
also have a blood sugar imbalance that exacerbates their condition.
How can you tell FMS from hypoglycemia? Through your pain.
Although hypoglycemia can cause some muscle aches and joint
pain, FMS patients generally ache all over: They experience pain in
the muscles, ligaments, and tendons. They have specific spots on
the body (called tender points) that hurt when pressed with
enough pressure to whiten the thumbnail. They may also have gen-
itourinary (cystitis, vaginal spasms, and so on) and gastrointesti-
nal complaints (bloating, gas, and constipation alternating with
diarrhea). Interested in knowing more? Check out Fibromyalgia For
Dummies, by Roland Staud, MD, and Christine Adamec (Wiley).
Candidiasis
Your immune system and the presence of beneficial bacteria in
your gut usually inhibit the overgrowth of candida albican, a fungi
normally found in the body, particularly in the mouth, vagina, and
intestinal tract.
If you’re stressed, have an infection, experience a nutritional imbal-
ance, or regularly use birth control pills, cortisone, or antibiotics
over a long period of time, candida can proliferate and change to a
fungoid form. Some people believe that this fungoid form can
damage the intestinal lining and produce a wide range of symp-
toms (many of which are the same as the symptoms caused by
hypoglycemia).
Candidiasis and hypoglycemia go hand in hand; if you have one of
these two conditions, you just may have the other, too. Why?
Because many people afflicted with hypoglycemia are also prone
to having a sweet-tooth or a carb-craving that contributes to their
blood sugar problems. (Okay, many of them are downright sugar
addicts!) And sweets and simple carbs — which turn into sugar in
the gut — spread yeast infections by feeding the candida!
Nothing proves that candidiasis exists as a disease state, and many
doctors, including Dr. Chow (this book’s co-author), are extremely
careful about making a diagnosis of candidiasis. Be wary of practi-
tioners who readily blame candidiasis for all kinds of health prob-
lems. Take a careful medical history and keep a meticulously
accurate food journal. (See Chapter 6 for information on how to
keep your own food journal.)
You may have reason to suspect candidiasis if you have a few of
the following conditions:
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
40

 Recurrent yeast infections
 Vaginal burning, itching, or discharge that proves resistant to
treatment
 History of cortisone or antibiotic therapy
 History of thrush or chronic cystitis
 Symptoms of hypoglycemia that are resistant to treatment
Going on a hypoglycemic diet can be very helpful if you think that
you have candidiasis. In addition, avoid foods that contain yeast or
are made with a fermentation process, including mature cheeses,
vinegar, mushrooms, yogurt, sauerkraut, soy sauce, honey,
oranges, and pickles.
Chronic fatigue syndrome
To make matters even more complex, chronic fatigue syndrome
(CFS) can coexist with fibromyalgia (and hypoglycemia can coexist
quite merrily with both these syndromes). In fact, CFS is quite simi-
lar to fibromyalgia.
A key CFS symptom is severe, unexplained fatigue that’s not
relieved by rest and that lasts for at least six or more consecutive
months. Other symptoms may include cognitive problems (lack of
concentration, memory loss), sore throat without signs of infec-
tion, unrestful sleep, muscle pain, and headaches.
Haggling with hypothyroidism
Are you overweight? Are you tired, irritable, and constipated? Do
you have headaches or a bad case of premenstrual syndrome?
Do you seem to be allergic to everything, and, for crying out loud,
are you losing your hair?
If you’re experiencing these symptoms, you may very well have
hypothyroidism, a condition where your thyroid gland doesn’t pro-
duce enough of the hormone that regulates your metabolism.
When you have too little thyroid hormone, you may experience
depression, chronic fatigue, circulatory problems, compulsive
overeating, and irritable bowel syndrome (whose symptoms
include gas with alternating constipation and diarrhea).
According to some practitioners, hypothyroidism is eight times
more common in women than in men, and it’s also an associated
condition of hypoglycemia. In other words, low blood sugar can be
caused by hypothyroidism, in which case you need to get your thy-
roid taken care of as soon as possible. You should change your diet,
as well. Eating wholesome, nourishing foods is always a good idea.
Chapter 3: Symptoms without a Cause 41

Joining the hypo bandwagon:
Hypoadrenalism
The adrenal glands are two very small glands above each kidney.
Although these glands are small, they’re very important, because
they produce various hormones. Hypoadrenalism (hypoadrenia),
or adrenal insufficiency, occurs when your adrenal glands become
depleted, causing a decrease in the output of adrenal hormones,
including cortisol, which is released in response to stress. Cortisol
increases blood pressure and blood sugar levels.
The extreme form of this condition, known as Addison’s disease,
can be life threatening if untreated. Fortunately it’s quite rare, but
if you do have it, you’re in good company. President John Kennedy
had adrenal insufficiency most of his life.
Less severe forms of low adrenal function (also called adrenal
fatigue) can cause weight gain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, depres-
sion, and panic attacks. And yes, these symptoms do sound dis-
turbingly similar to the hypoglycemic symptoms. Modern medicine
(mainstream Western medical practice) doesn’t recognize the low-
end, non-Addison’s adrenal fatigue as a distinct syndrome. But
many healthcare practitioners claim to have seen many patients
who suffer from diminished activity of the adrenal glands. And —
here’s the link to hypoglycemia — they believe that sluggish adre-
nal function can lead to low blood sugar.
Like sufferers of hypoglycemia, individuals whose adrenals are
exhausted often crave caffeine or carbs for a quick pick-me-up. You
may be suffering from either or both hypoglycemia and adrenal
fatigue. You can purchase salivary cortisol tests online to help you
see whether you have impaired adrenal function. You can take the
test at home and get the results from a lab. However, because cor-
tisol levels vary with the time of day, you’ll get more accurate read-
ings if you take four separate tests at different times.
In most cases, following the recommended dietary and lifestyle
changes we describe in this book can help with adrenal fatigue.
If those changes don’t help, go to a nutritionally oriented medical
doctor or naturopath. (Chapter 5 deals with lab tests, and Chapter 4
talks about alternative health practitioners.)
Because prolonged stress can lead to adrenal fatigue and exhaus-
tion, managing stress is critical to your health and well-being.
(Chapter 9 gives you tips on stress-busting.) Be sure to get plenty
of rest and exercise. And do something fun for yourself for 15 min-
utes or more every day.

Hypoglycemia and Diabetes —
Flip Sides of the Same Coin?
If you remember one thing from this book, make sure it’s this:
Insulin plays a critical role in your metabolism, which is directly
related to your health, energy, and well-being. Hormones such as
insulin, even a tiny amount, have incredibly powerful effects on the
body. (For more on insulin, flip to Chapter 2.)
Both diabetics and hypoglycemics have a glitch in their insulin func-
tioning. Because insulin sweeps away blood sugar, excess insulin
can lead to a drop in blood sugar. Sugars and simple starches trigger
a greater insulin response than other foods, which is one reason
why hypoglycemics are advised to stay away from them.
This section delves deeper into the connection between diabetes
and hypoglycemia so you can better understand the severity if you
suspect you have hypoglycemia.
Looking at the syndrome flowchart
Although it’s still a point of discussion, many researchers believe
that hypoglycemia can be seen as a pre-diabetic form of glucose
intolerance, which can eventually develop into full-blown diabetes
in people who are genetically predisposed to diabetes. In other
words, diabetes and hypoglycemia may fall on the continuum of
the same degenerative disease (see Figure 3-1).
Figure 3-1: The possible progression of syndromes.
Hypoglycemia starts with impaired glucose tolerance and then
develops into insulin resistance. People with insulin resistance
often also suffer from heart risk factors, such as elevated blood
pressure, low HDL cholesterol (the “good” kind), and abdominal
obesity. Some researchers have begun calling a collection of these
features Syndrome X. Bear in mind that there’s no clear-cut point
where one syndrome ends and the next one begins. If left untreated,
hypoglycemia may progress into other metabolic conditions that
culminate in type 2 diabetes.

Chapter 3: Symptoms without a Cause 43

 Impaired glucose tolerance: This is a pre-diabetic condition
in which the body is no longer able to use glucose well. The
cells are beginning to lose their sensitivity to insulin, and they
don’t readily respond when insulin tries to deliver glucose to
them, so the body produces more insulin.
 Insulin resistance: Even as the body is producing more
insulin, the cells are losing their sensitivity to insulin. The task
of insulin is to deliver blood sugar to cells but, in this stage,
blood sugar remains in the bloodstream even when the cells
stop responding. (Check out the nearby sidebar, “Insulin
resistance and the miracle ‘cure’” for more info.)
 Syndrome X: Sounds like a mystery novel, doesn’t it? Although
you’re not dealing with a murder mystery here, Syndrome X
can indeed be deadly. This pre-diabetic condition is also known
as insulin resistance syndrome or metabolic cardiovascular risk
syndrome (MCVS). The underlying problem in people with
Syndrome X is that their body is insensitive to insulin. (Think
of it as insulin resistance with a few other “baddies” thrown
in.) Other characteristics of Syndrome X include elevated
blood cholesterol and triglycerides (fatty acids that normally
circulate in the blood) and high blood pressure.
 Diabetes (type 2): This condition is a chronic syndrome of
impaired fat, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism due to
insufficient secretion of insulin or to insulin resistance. Blood
sugar level remains elevated after fasting.
Identifying the types of diabetes
Some researchers suspect that 60 percent of people who suffer
from hypoglycemia become diabetics. The two main types of dia-
betes are
 Type 1: This autoimmune disease develops when the pancreas
produces too little insulin or stops producing insulin altogether.
The disease may also be caused by a viral infection. Type 1
diabetes was previously known as juvenile diabetes because
it’s usually diagnosed in children and young adults.
 Type 2: This type of diabetes and hypoglycemia are like
mirror images of each other. You may think of diabetes and
hypoglycemia as part of the continuum of a progressive dis-
ease, with hypoglycemia at one end and diabetes at the other.
Many practitioners believe that hypoglycemia can develop
into type 2 diabetes, although this is a matter of debate. What
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
44

most people do agree on is that a poor diet is the contributing
factor — if not the cause — in both diabetes and hypo-
glycemia. Both are chronic degenerative diseases that
respond to dietary and lifestyle changes.
If you have a brother or sister with type 2 diabetes, you have 
about a 40 percent chance of getting the illness. If you have one
parent with the disease, you have a 10 percent chance of getting it.
Although genetic inheritance plays a part in the development of type 2
diabetes, diet and lifestyle can help prevent it. Excess weight —
obesity is a major contributing factor to type 2 diabetes — and
lack of exercise can trigger diabetes. Switching to a healthy diet
and working out regularly can considerably reduce your risk factor.
If you’re a low blood sugar sufferer, check into your family’s med-
ical history. When you look at the family medical history of hypo-
glycemics, you often find that they have close family members with
either hypoglycemia or type 2 diabetes. For more info about dia-
betes, check out Diabetes For Dummies, by Alan L. Rubin, MD
(Wiley). The book gives a thorough explanation of both types.
Chapter 3: Symptoms without a Cause 45
Insulin resistance and the miracle “cure”
What is insulin resistance? Your body’s cells stop responding to insulin, leading to
excess sugar remaining in the blood, which is a symptom of diabetes. Chronic hypo-
glycemia can lead to insulin resistance. (Flip to “Looking at the Syndrome flowchart”
earlier in this chapter.) Recent studies suggest that insulin resistance is an even
greater risk factor for heart attack than either HDL cholesterol or triglycerides levels.
If you happen to be one of the growing number of people with insulin resistance,
don’t despair. You can still beat the odds of developing diabetes with something as
simple and ordinary as regular exercise.
Scientists know that exercise improves insulin resistance and reduces the risk of
adult-onset type 2 diabetes. Apparently, exercise is effective in younger people as
well. A recent study focusing on 22 overweight teens found that after 16 weeks of
twice-weekly resistance training, insulin sensitivity significantly increased. During
the study, the adolescents’ body composition changed (body fat percentage
decreased and muscle mass increased), but even after adjusting for those changes
in body composition, insulin sensitivity improved considerably. The study surveyed
22 Latino youths. According to the American Diabetes Association, Latinos are 17
times more likely to be diabetic than white adolescents.

Nailing Down Hypoglycemia:
Symptoms throughout the Ages
No matter how old (or young) a person is, hypoglycemia can cause
irritating and even debilitating symptoms, but it can affect people
at different ages in different ways. Although the normal range of
blood sugar levels varies with age, some people exhibit symptoms
even with blood sugar levels well within the normal range. Others
remain free of symptoms even when the blood sugar drops below
that normal range. (Turn to Chapter 1 for more about the difficul-
ties of accurately identifying hypoglycemia.)
Don’t start worrying and don’t become preoccupied about what
might go wrong. Living a happy and healthy life is possible at any
age if you stick to a healthy diet (see Chapter 6) and a sensible
exercise program (see Chapter 8). A regular weight-bearing exer-
cise is particularly beneficial in regulating blood sugar.
The bottom line: Hypoglycemia can occur at any age. In this sec-
tion, we look at how this condition affects people at different
stages in their lives.
Hypoglycemia and newborns
Being able to tell when babies and toddlers are suffering from
hypoglycemia is difficult. Possible symptoms include jitteriness,
poor feeding, lethargy, and low body temperature.
A baby’s blood sugar may be low immediately after delivery if the
mother was diabetic during pregnancy. The fetal pancreas releases
more insulin to balance Mom’s excess blood sugar. Such a baby is
referred to as an IDM (infant of diabetic mother). Other causes for
hypoglycemia in newborn children include nutritional deficiency
during pregnancy; prolonged fasting, if something keeps the baby
from feeding properly; liver disease in the newborn; premature
birth; and unusually low birth weight.
Hypoglycemia is very common in association with certain congeni-
tal (since birth) hereditary disorders of metabolism. Babies in fam-
ilies with a history of genetically based metabolic disorders need
appropriate medical tests to screen for possible problems.
Part I: Addressing Your Ups and Downs 
46

Hypoglycemia and children
Children may suffer from hypoglycemia if they have diarrhea,
growth hormone deficiency, or some congenital disorder resulting
in the production of excess insulin. If a child suddenly shows
symptoms like those of hypoglycemia, make sure that she hasn’t
accidentally swallowed something potentially toxic, such as med-
ication meant for someone else.
Older children and teenagers may experience episodes of hypo-
glycemia if they skip meals or eat sugar-laden, high-carbohydrate
junk foods. As in adults, poor eating habits can lead to feelings of
shakiness, fatigue, and other problems.
Make sure your kids aren’t grabbing just donuts or candy bars —
which can lead to a blood sugar crash — for breakfast. Encourage
them to follow the diet outlined in Chapter 6 as much as possible.
Hypoglycemia and pregnant women
Even if you never had hypoglycemia before you got pregnant, if
you start experiencing fatigue, weakness, dizziness, nausea, and
other signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, you may well be suf-
fering from it. It’s most likely a temporary bout of hypoglycemia
that clears up after pregnancy, but be sure to let your doctor know.
Follow a healthy diet and you’ll give birth to a healthy baby. Of
course, it’s not quite that simple. But you’ll certainly improve the
odds of a healthy birth by sticking to a healthy diet. If your diet
hasn’t been quite so healthy, pregnancy may be a great motivation
for improvement. A proper diet is especially important during this
period because the changing hormone levels during pregnancy may
make you prone to blood sugar imbalance, either hypoglycemia or
diabetes. Appropriate exercise is also beneficial to pregnant women,
but if you’re prone to low blood sugar, make sure you eat a small
pre-exercise snack and another snack right after working out.
Be extra careful in keeping your blood sugar balanced. Consult
your gynecologist about how best to handle a hypoglycemic or dia-
betic sugar imbalance during your pregnancy.
Chapter 3: Symptoms without a Cause 47

Hypoglycemia and 
menopausal women
We hate to be the bearer of bad news. But the truth is, in some
cases, hypoglycemia can aggravate menopausal symptoms, and
vice versa. Symptoms such as depression, headaches, dizziness, and
heart palpitations may become more pronounced if you’re a hypo-
glycemic undergoing menopause. Imagine adding hypoglycemic
symptoms to the normal challenges of fluctuating hormone levels!
Sticking to your hypoglycemic diet is the key to remaining healthy.
After you reach middle age, you may find that you have to be even
more rigorous with your diet. Alcohol and sweets, always a no-no
for hypoglycemics, may cause more problems for you as your
body changes with age.
Hypoglycemia and older people
As you age, the risk of hypoglycemia may increase. Because older
people often take a number of different medications, they some-
times suffer from hypoglycemia brought on by complex drug inter-
actions. Other possible causes are hormone-related, such as
adrenal insufficiency (adrenal glands not producing enough corti-
sol in response to stress) or hypopituitarism (pituitary gland not
producing normal amounts of hormones).
A patient with type 2 diabetes is always at greater risk of hypo-
glycemia due to the insulin or other medication he takes to lower
his blood sugar. This risk may be heightened as the diabetic gets
older. If a diabetic who takes insulin also has chronic renal
(kidney) failure, the risk of hypoglycemia increases considerably.
If you’re a senior citizen, or if you’re taking care of one, know that
an older person’s awareness of hypoglycemia’s tell-tale signs may
be diminished. Therefore, even if the senior citizen doesn’t think
he has hypoglycemia, if he undergoes a sudden or profound change
of mental state, or if he becomes agitated without apparent cause,
make sure to screen for hypoglycemia in addition to any other
screening your physician recommends. His cognitive difficulties
may be caused by hypoglycemia and not senility.
Because older people sometimes have difficulty absorbing nutri-
ents properly, vitamins and other dietary supplements may benefit
them greatly. (Flip to Chapter 7 for information on herbs, vitamins,
and other kinds of supplements.) Always consult your healthcare
provider to see what may work best for you.

Diagnosing and
Treating Your
Hypoglycemia

In this part . . .
P
erhaps a chance remark or something you read gave
you some cause to suspect that you or your loved one
may be hypoglycemic. This part provides essential info to
help you ﬁnd a doctor who understands your symptoms
and determine whether you really do suffer from hypo-
glycemia (or some other related condition). We describe
and cover the underlying biochemistry behind hypo-
glycemia, as well as how to get tested. We help you sort
through all the complexities and permutations of this syn-
drome and rule out other possible causes for what’s ailing
you. Because hypoglycemia means low blood sugar, we talk
about sugar a lot: what it is, how your body metabolizes it,
and what it does to your health. Ah, such a sweet subject,
sugar. But it’s a bittersweet one, as this part tells you.
We also discuss the role of nutrition in health, particularly
the great signiﬁcance it has for the hypoglycemic person.
You discover that the only way you can recover from
hypoglycemia is by changing your diet. Nothing else you
do can have the same impact on your health. It doesn’t
matter how many ﬂower essences you inhale, herbs or
supplements you quaff, mantras you chant, or acupunc-
ture treatments you receive: The bottom line is that you
have to change your diet.
After you make the change, you may want to supplement
your diet with vitamins, herbs, and supplements. This part
has a chapter complete with different supplements that
may help relieve some of your symptoms.

 Finding the right doctor for you
 Deciding which specialist to see
 Preparing for doctor visits
 Considering alternative healing methods
You’d probably rather recline on a couch than trying to recline
in a clinic waiting room, right? But hey, everyone has to do it
sooner or later. Rather than jump to conclusions about your health,
you owe it to yourself to get a thorough physical check-up to make
sure that you get a proper diagnosis of your hypoglycemia symp-
toms. And you need to make sure that your low blood sugar isn’t
due to other causes or something totally unrelated. Only when
you’ve ruled out other illnesses can you begin the proper treat-
ment. The danger of self-diagnosis is that you may be treating
yourself for a problem that doesn’t even exist, while the real dis-
ease goes untreated.
This chapter discusses the importance of visiting a doctor on a
regular basis to monitor your hypoglycemia and how you can find
the right doctor for you. If you want to see a specialist, this chap-
ter helps you, and if you’re interested in alternative medicines, this
chapter provides helpful info to manage your hypoglycemia.
Why Seeing a Doc on a Regular
Basis Is Important
When dealing with your health, you have to be proactive and take
charge. If you’re too weak, fatigued, depressed, or whatever to
muster up the energy and clarity of mind, assign someone you

trust to take care of things for you. If no family member or friend
can help, consider paying a professional, or perhaps a therapist or
a life coach. Hiring a pro obviously costs more, but the expenses
are only temporary. And you’ll feel better.
After all is said and done, treating hypoglycemia is surprisingly
simple and low-tech. Avoid refined sugars and starches, eat high-
quality protein and whole, natural foods, and exercise regularly.
Get a good belly laugh every day. Most of your treatment plan
starts with your doctor, who can help you lead a healthier lifestyle
and monitor your progress.
You may avoid the doctor’s office because you’re afraid of needles.
We confess that some minor discomfort may be involved, depend-
ing on what tests your doctor administers, but standard physicals
are pretty much pain-free. And we promise you that the experience
is much less traumatic than that time you were abducted by space
aliens. The medical staff is much more human, for one thing; they’re
basically nice folks who want you to feel comfortable and relaxed.
Keeping on top of your health, with the help of your primary care
physician (PCP), is extremely important. You can identify problems —
and potential problems — earlier and nip them in the bud. Don’t
wait until you’re in dire need of medical attention before you see a
doctor; preventing problems is often easier than treating them.
Okay, okay — the lecture’s over. Now go make an appointment 
with a doctor. Do you know who you should see? Maybe you’re not
sure. In that case, read on; this chapter helps you determine who
you should hire (and maybe fire) and lets you know what to expect
when you get a physical. If you’d rather see an alternative health
practitioner, we have suggestions for finding one of those, too.
Paging Dr. Perfection
You may have to put forth some effort when trying to find a good
doctor for treating your symptoms of hypoglycemia. Aside from
being competent and having the proper credentials, your doctor
should be caring and compassionate.
We advocate finding a doctor who suits you, but you may not have
the time to search him out when you’re suffering from the symptoms
of hypoglycemia. Your first step has to be getting those symptoms
checked out, even if it means going to a doctor you’re not crazy
about. See your current physician, a referral from a friend, or who-
ever can fit you in at your local hospital. After an exam confirms
that you’re not suffering from something serious, such as a tumor,
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
52

for example, you can then take your time to choose a healthcare
provider who meets your needs and your expectations.
Knowing what to look for in a doc
Reactive hypoglycemia — the kind we discuss in this book — isn’t
life threatening by itself, although the symptoms and effects are
known to seriously affect careers, relationships, and lives. Organic
causes of hypoglycemia are a different story. Some of the underly-
ing diseases or conditions can potentially be life threatening and
can best be diagnosed during a thorough medical examination.
(Check out Chapter 1 for more info.)
You have several things to consider when choosing a doctor:
 Familiarity with hypoglycemia (or at least being open-minded
about it)
 Belief in the importance of nutrition for maintaining good health
 Willingness to work with alternative healthcare practitioners
 Taking your health complaints seriously
 Spending the time to thoroughly evaluate your condition
 Listening carefully to what you say
 Encouraging you to ask questions
 Asking you effective questions
 Explaining things clearly and fully
 Anticipating your health problems
 Welcoming your participation in the treatment
 Flexibility (no, not the kind that lets him do the splits)
Add anything else that’s truly important to you to this list. The
doctor’s office location, the hospital where the doctor treats
patients, and your health insurance may all factor into your con-
sideration. Avoid anyone who’s dismissive of you and your con-
cerns. Drop him back into the swamp for further evolution. You
deserve better than that.
More doctors are becoming open to discussion and treatment of
conditions such as chronic hypoglycemia, which still isn’t univer-
sally accepted as a valid diagnosis. Depending on your location,
however, you may have to work to find these doctors. If you can’t
find a good doctor, you may consider going to a highly regarded
alternative practitioner — but only after you’ve been cleared of
Chapter 4: Matching Up with the Right Doc 53

organic causes of hypoglycemia. Always consult your physician
before jumping to conclusions or consulting alternative healthcare
practitioners.
Finding the right doc
After you know the qualities you want your doctor to have, develop
a list of potential doctors in order to find the right doc for you.
Keep the following steps in mind:
1. Ask around.
Ask friends, coworkers, relatives, or any other health profes-
sionals you know who have been treated for hypoglycemia. If
you don’t know anyone who has hypoglycemia, contact a
local medical society, church, or university medical center.
(See the sidebar, “Cruise the Web for doctor-related mat-
ters” for online help.) Get several names, just in case the
doctor you select isn’t taking new patients or doesn’t par-
ticipate in your health insurance plan.
2. When someone recommends a doctor, ask that person
specific questions, such as:
• What is the doctor’s area of expertise?
• How would you describe the doctor’s bedside manner?
• What kind of experience did you have with the doctor?
3. Set up an appointment just to chat with the doctor.
Make sure you both understand that you’re trying to
decide on a doctor. You’ll have to pay for the visit, but you
may save yourself some money in the long run. (See
“Preparing Shows You’re Caring [about Yourself]” later in
this chapter for specific info.)
During this call, ask the office about the doctor’s fees, pay-
ment procedures, and insurance coverage.

Dealing with doubters
Unfortunately, many doctors think that the only hypoglycemia
that’s legitimate is the type of low blood sugar that’s induced by
diabetics who miscalculate the amount of insulin they need. If
you’re suffering from a chronic condition of hypoglycemia that
can’t be traced to an obvious cause, your doctor may be tempted
to dismiss your complaints. Should that happen, don’t take it 
personally. Western medicine is used to treating illnesses aggres-
sively with drugs and surgery rather than diet and lifestyle 
modifications.
Here are some reasons why a doctor may not believe hypoglycemia
is causing your symptoms:
 Hypoglycemia has been rampantly overdiagnosed.
 Experts disagree on exactly what constitutes hypoglycemia.
 Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) for hypoglycemia (see Chapter 5)
don’t always show abnormally low levels of blood sugar.
 The array of symptoms are nonspecific (fatigue, dizziness,
and depression, for example) and can have many different
causes other than hypoglycemia.
 Patients can too easily ascribe everything to hypoglycemia,
because it’s associated with so many different symptoms.
 The symptoms associated with hypoglycemia can’t be pin-
pointed to a specific dysfunction or damaged organs.
If your doctor doesn’t believe you have hypoglycemia, but you’re
convinced that there’s something physically wrong, then check out
alternative practitioners who are more open to treating nonspecific
health issues. (Check out “Putting Some Ohhhhmm into It:
Alternative Medicine” later in this chapter.)
Choosing a Specialist
So, have you confessed everything to your kind doctor? Are you
wondering whether you should see a specialist? Specialists offer
many options. Specialists have at least three years of specialty
training, under supervision, after getting their MD degree. Some
specialists are primary care doctors, such as family physicians or
internists (more on them in the next section). Other specialists con-
centrate on certain body systems, specific age groups, or complex
scientific techniques.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
56

A good way to find out about a doctor’s expertise is to ask about
her board certification. To be board certified after graduating from
medical school, doctors have to pass an exam certifying them as
specialists in certain fields of medicine. They also have to complete
150 hours of continuing medical education every three years and
pass a comprehensive exam every seven years. (At least you know
that they haven’t forgotten everything they learned in med school.)
Is a specialist right for you? You’re probably better off going to a
doctor who already has your medical history first. Spend some
time going over your symptoms and all your health concerns. Your
doctor can direct you to the proper specialist should you need one.
This section covers the main types of specialists that may help.
Internists and family doctors
Internists and family docs both can treat your hypoglycemia. So
how do you know whether you need a specialist? The differences
between an internist and a family physician are as follows:
 An internist is a doctor of adults who specializes in the diagnosis
and treatment of nonsurgical ailments. You can find internists in
hospitals and clinics. Some internists may specialize in other
areas and become the friendly specialist that your illness calls
for. These specialty areas may include arthritis, asthma, cancer,
diabetes, and most surgical procedures.
 A family doctor is basically a general practitioner (GP) who
has done residency in family practice. Family physicians pro-
vide healthcare to individuals regardless of their age. They
give you regular check-ups, and they diagnose and treat most
patient problems. You can visit a family doctor for a glucose
tolerance test, which doctors sometimes use to screen for
hypoglycemia. (See Chapter 5 to find out more about glucose
tolerance tests.) Family physicians can refer you to another
specialist if they can’t treat certain problems.
If you’re not sure what you have, or you suspect that you have
hypoglycemia, internists or family docs are probably your best bet.
Internists and family docs can schedule tests and refer you to hos-
pitals and other specialists as needed. They discuss your treat-
ment with your family (if appropriate) and anyone else involved in
your healthcare. Their role is that of team leader.
Endocrinologists
Endocrinologists specialize in diseases and disorders of the
endocrine system (hormones), which is involved in blood sugar
Chapter 4: Matching Up with the Right Doc 57

regulation. Endocrinologists also treat diabetes, a condition that’s
connected to blood sugar regulation. In fact, both diabetics and
hypoglycemics benefit from similar dietary restrictions and
approaches (check out Chapter 6 for more info).
Should you see an endocrinologist if you think that you have hypo-
glycemia? Unless you have a glowing personal recommendation for
an innovative endocrinologist with experience in hypoglycemia, an
endocrinologist probably isn’t your best bet. Why? Because, as
specialists, endocrinologists are more familiar with serious ill-
nesses and aren’t usually attuned to identifying hypoglycemia’s
chronic conditions. If you want someone who’s more attuned to
hypoglycemia, go to your family doctor first.
You may consider seeing an endocrinologist, though, if you’re obese,
and you fail to lose weight after following the hypoglycemic food
program for several months. (Keep a food journal to make sure
that you’re not subconsciously cheating! Flip to Chapter 6 to see
how to keep a journal.) You may be suffering from other metabolic
or hormonal imbalances. Endocrinologists are real pros at treating
these conditions, as well as at identifying genetic or other factors
(such as insulin resistance) that may be affecting your weight.
Preparing Shows You’re 
Caring (About Yourself)
So you’ve talked to your friends, made a short list of potential doc-
tors, and made an appointment with a prospective doctor. Before
you head to the doctor’s office, set aside 15–20 minutes a few days
beforehand and plan ahead.
This section discusses what you need to take to your doctor’s
appointment and how to evaluate your doctor’s visit to determine
whether this doctor is right for you.
What to take to your appointment
Before you visit your doctor, make sure that you take the time to
prepare for the visit. You can’t just walk in and wing it. You’re talk-
ing about your health right now, and you have the doctor’s full
attention, so make the most of it.
In order to have the most productive visit possible, prepare the fol-
lowing items before your first appointment:
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
58

 A list of all your symptoms. (Chapter 3 can help you in this
arena.) Don’t just leave your list of symptoms on the kitchen
table; bring it with you! Chronic hypoglycemia can make you a
wee bit forgetful, and the list can help jog your memory. You
can show the doctor the list, but flesh out your symptoms by
describing as completely as possible the timing, frequency,
intensity, and duration of your problems.
When relating your symptoms, go from the general to the spe-
cific. Describe the following:
• How it feels, followed by facts that you can see or touch,
such as body temperature
• When you first started to notice the symptom
• The time of the day that it occurs
• Whether you see a pattern
• How the various symptoms are affecting your life 
and work
 Your medical history (including dates for surgeries, hospi-
talizations, and major illnesses) and your family’s medical
history. Get copies of your medical records to show your
doctor. (Most clinics have a medical history form for you to
fill out. Bringing a copy of your medical records simplifies this
procedure and ensures accuracy.)
Consult your family beforehand, so that you can construct as
accurate and complete a medical history as possible. You may
think that you know your family’s medical history, but your
parents or grandparents may have had illnesses that you
aren’t aware of. Grill your parents and siblings if you have to.
 The names of medications you’re taking and the dosage.
(Give either the generic or brand name, but skip any pet names
you call them.) Your list should include any and all prescribed
and over-the-counter (OTC) meds (medications you don’t need a
prescription for), vitamins, herbal supplements (see Chapter 7
for more on these treatments), and birth control. (Take samples
of any herbs you’re taking if you’re unsure of the name. This is
particularly true if you’re also seeing a Chinese herbalist.)
 Your food diary containing a record of everything you eat
and any symptoms you have. (Chapter 6 tells you how.)
Showing what you’ve eaten may provide clues. However, don’t
expect your doctor to spend much time going over your diary.
She’ll likely just want a general idea. Some clinics provide you
with forms that ask questions about your typical diet.
 A list of any treatments that you’re receiving from other
practitioners. These healthcare practitioners may include 
Chapter 4: Matching Up with the Right Doc 59

chiropractors, acupuncturists, dietitians, homeopaths, natur-
opaths, and osteopaths (but no psychopaths, please!).
 A pen and paper for taking notes. Jot down the most impor-
tant points that your doctor covers, including advice or rec-
ommendations. Forgetting everything that was said is easy,
especially when you’re nervous. (When you find yourself
nervous, take a few deep breaths to calm down.)
 Insurance forms, cards, and other relevant data. Many
doctor’s offices make copies of your insurance card and
driver’s license, and many billing departments won’t file your
claim unless you provide them with a form. Ask about what
you need to bring before your appointment.
 A list of any questions for your doc. Ask your potential doctor
these types of questions to see whether she’s right for you:
• Why do you think I’m having these problems? Your
doctor should be able to offer some explanations. If 
he brushes you off, or immediately decides what you
have — without bothering to review your medical history
or ask you relevant questions — find someone else.
• If I don’t have hypoglycemia, what do I have? Be sure
to take notes if your doctor suggests the names of other
illnesses. If you don’t know what they are, ask her.
• When will you know what’s causing the problem? If
the doctor directs you to take a battery of tests, then
he’ll wait for the results before he can accurately diag-
nose you.
• Are you familiar with diagnosing and treating hypo-
glycemia patients? If so, how many have you treated?
Your doctor may not believe in hypoglycemia. If not, just
make a mental note to yourself to find another health
professional for this condition. All you’re doing now is
ensuring that you don’t have problems other than hypo-
glycemia for which you should obtain medical treatment.
• Do your patients with hypoglycemia improve with
treatment? Obviously, if the doctor doesn’t believe that
hypoglycemia is a clinical entity, then she’s likely not
even treating them.
• What course of action do you plan on taking? What is
the treatment plan? No drugs can cure hypoglycemia. If
the doctor recommends expensive treatment options,
you should probably find another doctor.
• What diet plan do you recommend? If your doctor says
that nutrition has no bearing or that you simply need to
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
60

eat a balanced meal, you’re seeing the wrong professional.
Find someone with more expertise in hypoglycemia.
• Can you refer me to a nutritionist, dietician, or other
alternative healthcare practitioner (someone other
than a doctor who practices traditional Western medi-
cine)? Chronic conditions such as hypoglycemia are
better treated by alternative healthcare practitioners or
doctors who practice integrative medicine. (These med-
ical doctors are also proficient in alternative healthcare,
such as acupuncture and herbal remedies.) Check out
the “Putting Some Ohhhhmm into It: Alternative
Medicine” section later in this chapter for more info.
In addition, coax a family member or friend into accompanying you
to the visit. This person can prod your memory or provide more
details about your illness, and she can give moral support to keep
you on track if you get nervous. (Or kick you in the shin if you’re
not making any sense.) Oh, one more thing: No visit to the doctor
is complete without nutritional snacks and reading materials (or
quiet hand-held computer games).
Following up after the appointment
After the appointment, you want to figure out whether the doctor
is a good fit. Ask yourself these questions:
 Did I feel comfortable with the doctor?
 Did I feel comfortable asking questions?
 Do I have confidence in this doctor?
 Did the doctor spend enough time answering all my questions?
 Did I actually understand what the doctor was saying? Did he
explain things in terms I understand?
If you aren’t reasonably satisfied, visit another doctor. If you feel
okay about everything, schedule a complete physical exam. A com-
plete exam includes tests for all your body’s systems (cardiovascu-
lar, gastrointestinal, and more), as well as disease screenings. As
you know, the doctor is going to take lots of things: a blood sample,
urine and/or stool samples, and X-rays. Make sure to follow all
instructions when preparing for the exam. If you’re asked to refrain
from eating or drinking anything other than water, do just as you’re
directed. If you don’t follow your doctor’s instructions, you can
invalidate your test results.
Chapter 4: Matching Up with the Right Doc 61

Putting Some Ohhhhmm into It:
Alternative Medicine
Two kinds of medical treatment can help alleviate your hypo-
glycemia. Earlier in this chapter, we talk about one kind: allopathic
(Western) medicine, which targets specific illnesses with drugs
and/or surgery. Allopathic treatment isn’t always well-suited to
addressing the numerous chronic complaints of a typical low
blood-sugar sufferer. In almost all cases, the other kind of medical
treatment — alternative or integrative medicine — may yield
noticeable benefits beyond those available through conventional
Western medicine.
This section focuses specifically on alternative medicine and how
you can use it to treat your hypoglycemia. This section also dis-
cusses the many options available to you, including herbal medi-
cine and acupuncture, and how you can use Western medicine and
alternative medicine together to treat your hypoglycemia.
Defining your alternatives
Today, patients can benefit from many acceptable alternatives. The
American Board of Holistic Medicine (ABHM) defines holistic medi-
cine as “the art and science that addresses the whole person, body,
mind and spirit.” A holistic approach to treatment of hypoglycemia,
with its focus on the interconnectedness of various factors (body,
mind, emotional, social, and environmental) may be of great bene-
fit as a supplement to conventional medical treatment, or even as a
treatment in its own right.
In addition to viewing the mind and body as inseparable, alternative
medicines use noninvasive (not requiring surgery), nonpharmaceuti-
cal (herbal or homeopathic remedies instead of prescription drugs)
techniques. Many symptoms and conditions that are unresponsive
to conventional treatment may yield to the application of nature’s
remedies. Although these techniques aren’t yet accepted by most
conventional medical doctors, an increasing number of such doc-
tors are beginning to offer both allopathic and holistic approaches.
More insurance plans are beginning to cover alternative treatment
approaches, but even if your insurance doesn’t cover the alterna-
tive therapy you choose, selecting an alternative medicine practi-
tioner can be worth the cost.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
62

Considering your alternatives
So what alternatives can you consider? The alternatives are too
numerous to list them all in this chapter. However, this section
covers a few that we believe may be especially helpful for 
hypoglycemia.
Nutritional counseling
Much of the treatment for hypoglycemia revolves around food. As
a result, you may want to consult a nutritional counselor or dieti-
tian regarding possibilities for changing your diet or taking advan-
tage of nutritional supplements.
A list of registered dietitians is available at the American Dietetic
Association’s Web site (www.eatright.org). Make sure the profes-
sional you consult is properly qualified and has a good track
record for treatment of hypoglycemia. When choosing a dietitian
or nutritionist, note that some professionals don’t recognize
chronic hypoglycemia as a bona fide diagnosis.
Herbal medicine
Herbal medicine is an alternative treatment that involves using
supplements, powders, and actual raw herbs. Herbal medicine
dates back to pre-history. People worldwide have used indigenous
plants as remedies for illnesses. These are the three major
approaches to herbal medicine:
 Western: The Western approach to herbal medicine has its
roots in Greece and Rome. North American herbal medicine 
is based on European and Native American folk tradition.
Plants or their extracts are used to treat specific symptoms
and illnesses.
 Indian (Ayurvedic): Ayurvedic herbal medicine is part of
Ayurvedic traditional medicine practiced in India for thou-
sands of years. Patients are treated holistically as body, mind,
and spirit. Herbs are used to balance the three main body
types (Vata, Pitta, and Kappa). Because some Ayurvedic 
herbs may contain heavy metals at unsafe levels, go to a
licensed Ayurvedic medical practitioner instead of buying
OTC remedies.
 Chinese: Chinese herbal medicine is part of a centuries-old
system of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Doctors pre-
scribe herbs (preparations sometimes include minerals or
animal products) to restore energy (Qi) balances. In China,
herbs are used in state hospitals along with allopathic medicine.
Chapter 4: Matching Up with the Right Doc 63

Just because something is natural doesn’t mean that it can’t also be
dangerous. Certain herbs don’t go well when taken with prescrip-
tion medicine. Consult your doctor before taking any herbal reme-
dies. (For additional info on taking herbs, flip to Chapter 7.) And
remember that herbs are meant to support you in your recovery —
making the necessary dietary and lifestyle changes is still up to
you. For hypoglycemics, the two pillars of recovery are diet (see
Chapter 6 for specific recommendations on what to eat and what to
avoid) and exercise (see Chapter 8 for tips on effective workouts).
Naturopathic medicine
Naturopathic medicine stresses health maintenance, disease 
prevention, and patient education and responsibility. It’s not identi-
fied with any particular type of therapy; it’s more a philosophy 
of life and health. You can find naturopathic doctors by visiting
The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians Web site
(www.naturopathic.org).
Orthomolecular psychiatry
Orthomolecular psychiatry is a treatment that’s also called the bio-
chemical approach. Orthomolecular psychiatry believes that when
the brain is biochemically disorganized, so is the mind. It also
believes in the existence of great individual differences in nutritional
needs and metabolic processes. Doctors who practice this treat-
ment use large, therapeutic doses of specific vitamins, nutrients,
amino acids, trace elements, or fatty acids to achieve healing. They
may also insist that you eliminate certain foods or food additives.
Acupuncture
An acupuncturist inserts very thin, sterile, stainless steel needles
into points along the body’s meridians. (Meridians are invisible
channels that form the body’s energy network.) Many acupunctur-
ists also use moxibustion, a procedure in which moxa (a dry, yellow,
fluffy material made from the herb mugwort) is rolled into a cone
or a tiny ball, placed on a meridian acupoint, and lit.
Acupuncture not only helps ease hypoglycemic symptoms but it
may also address the underlying blood sugar problem. To contact
a qualified acupuncturist, ask for recommendations from a trusted
physician or friend. You can also visit the American Academy of
Medical Acupuncture Web site at www.medicalacupuncture.org.
Therapeutic massage and bodywork
Hands-on manipulation for healing is one of the oldest healing
modalities in the world. Bodywork is an integral part of healthcare
in many traditional cultures, most notably China and India. You can
find some 80 different varieties of bodywork.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
64

Depending on patient need and therapist orientation, a patient can
take on a combination of massage and various types of structural
integrative bodywork. Bodywork can
 Reduce stress. One of the proven effects of massage and body-
work is the release of endorphins — the happy hormones —
and the reduction of stress hormones. Some studies suggest
that stress may have as much of an impact on hypoglycemic
symptoms as diet. But why is the release of stress and tension
so good for people suffering from low blood sugar? Well, you
end up with better blood circulation, which in turn improves the
transportation of oxygen and nutrients throughout the body.
 Ease physical pain. Bodywork can also ease the sensation of
physical pain — such as headaches and muscle stiffness —
that can often accompany hypoglycemia.
Energy medicine
Energy medicine has hundreds of styles and schools. It’s somewhat
loosely defined as any healing approach whose underlying premise
is that sickness and disease arise from imbalances in the vital energy
field of the body. Practitioners work on clearing blocks to get the
body’s energies into a good flow, harmony, and balance. The aim is
to promote overall health, vitality, and healing. Traditional Chinese
medicine can be considered a form of energy medicine, because it
views the body as an energy system (see the nearby sidebar “Releas-
ing the qi with Chinese medicine”). One school of energy medicine
that’s rapidly gaining popularity is EFT (Emotional Freedom Tech-
nique). See Chapter 9 for the ways EFT can reduce stress.
The usefulness of energy medicine in the treatment of blood sugar
imbalances is that it addresses the physical and emotional dysfunc-
tions that are fairly typical manifestations of hypoglycemia. Another
advantage is that patients can learn the many relatively simple
energetic techniques for self-treatment. You can save time and
money by treating yourself — and at your convenience — instead
of relying only on other practitioners who may not always be avail-
able at the exact time that you need them. Energy medicine can 
be used in conjunction with medical practices, other alternative
modalities, or as a complete system for self-care and self-help.
Working in tandem
Combining the Western and Eastern methods of healing may create
the best of all worlds. This combination of methods may sound like
something that’s not easy to accomplish, but it’s actually quite
possible. For instance, the clinics run by Dr. Chow (the co-author
Chapter 4: Matching Up with the Right Doc 65

of this book) offer integrated treatments to patients. Patients get
regular physical check-ups and conventional Western medical care,
which includes prescription medication, but they can also receive
chiropractic, acupuncture, and Chinese herb treatments. The
doctor can recommend alternative therapies that are appropriate
for the patient, or the patient may ask for integrated treatment.
These one-stop clinics are becoming more common in larger cities.
Ask your healthcare practitioner for a referral.
If you don’t have the opportunity to go to a one-stop clinic, however,
make sure that your alternative medicine practitioners work with
your primary physician. This way, you can avoid getting conflicting
advice or having an important aspect of your health overlooked.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
66
Releasing the qi with Chinese medicine
A growing body of research supports the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM). TCM particularly excels in conditions, such as chronic or nonspecific com-
plaints, that Western medicine is weak at treating. All TCM practices are aimed at
removing blockages to qi (or chi, or energy), as well as at restoring, rebalancing,
and increasing the qi of an affected organ or organs.
What can you expect from a visit to a practitioner of TCM? He will carefully exam-
ine your face and tongue, take your pulse, perhaps feel your abdomen, and ask you
detailed questions about your health, diet, lifestyle, and so on, before arriving at a
diagnosis. The practitioner won’t say that you’re suffering from hypoglycemia.
Instead, he may say, for instance, that you have too much dampness and cold in
your body, and some stagnation in the kidney areas. In fact, two people with hypo-
glycemia can get different descriptions of what’s ailing them, with the treatments
varying accordingly. These differing diagnoses don’t mean that the TCM doctors
are wrong, or that what they’re about to do doesn’t have a prayer’s chance of work-
ing. They simply mean that the causes of low blood sugar that are overlooked by
Western doctors may be picked up by TCM practitioners, who view health through
a different prism and attach different labels to dysfunctions of the body. TCM doc-
tors can adjust herbal formulas in infinitesimal ways to fit your body’s constitution.
Similarly, with acupuncture, a practitioner can vary needling techniques and points
of insertion to suit your body’s requirements.
With TCM, some people see immediate improvement, while others don’t. Realize
that because TCM tries to get to the root of an illness, you may have to undergo
many sessions before you see results. If you’re interested in TCM, check your insur-
ance plan to see whether it covers alternative healthcare, and make sure that the
practitioner is licensed and certified.

Here’s some additional advice to consider when you’re being
treated with alternative medicine:
 Don’t try too many different therapies. It’ll be confusing and
very expensive for you.
 Avoid doctor-hopping. Make sure that you give one doctor
and one approach sufficient time to work for you.
 Create a file for yourself. Keep an accurate record of all your
office visits, meds, vitamins, supplements, and anything else
that you’ve been given, and take notes at each session. Your
healthcare providers should be aware of everything you’re
doing in terms of your health.

Getting the Lowdown
on Low Blood Sugar
In This Chapter
 Determining whether you have hypoglycemia
 Figuring out what glucose tolerance tests can do
P
erhaps you’ve been suffering from vague symptoms, like those
we describe in Chapter 3, that you think may indicate hypo-
glycemia. Maybe you suspect that your body can’t metabolize carbs
properly. Or, maybe you’re just the curious type. This chapter may
provide a moment of truth: Here you find tools that help determine
whether you have hypoglycemia. Following the guidelines in this
chapter can help you make a good assessment of your symptoms.
(Of course, see your doctor for the best assessment.)
Diagnosing hypoglycemia isn’t as definitive as diagnosing diabetes.
There’s no absolute standard for determining hypoglycemia. You
can take the glucose tolerance test (GTT), but it’s not an infallible
tool. Your doctor should also review your medical history and
symptoms. In that sense, hypoglycemia is very much like other
controversial diagnoses, such as chronic fatigue syndrome and
fibromyalgia. (In fact, those syndromes may often be associated
with low blood sugar; see Chapter 3 for more info.) Unfortunately,
many people don’t take hypoglycemia seriously. They see it as “the
disease de jour” that hypochondriacs latch on to.
Taking the tests in this chapter doesn’t substitute for seeing a
doctor. Even if you test negatively here, see a doctor if you suspect
that you have hypoglycemia or any other disorder.
Poking and Prodding Yourself
Before you gallivant to your doctor, you can prepare to see
whether your symptoms truly indicate hypoglycemia. The best

way to start is to take the questionnaire from this section. In addi-
tion, you may want to consider going on the trial diet later in the
“Eating by trial” section, which can give you more info about your
health, making it easier for your doctor to arrive at a diagnosis.
Filling in the circles: A questionnaire
Before you fill out the questionnaire, photocopy it, or leave your-
self enough room to write down answers at a later date. Make sure
that you write down the date you’re taking the test; take the test
every three weeks to keep track of your progress. All right, now
you’re primed and prepped. Answer Yes or No to the following:
Date:
Yes
No
Do you often crave sweets?
Do you generally feel ravenously hungry between meals?
Do you worry constantly or experience unprovoked anxieties?
Do you have trouble sleeping?
Are you irritable if you miss a meal?
Do you feel tired, weak, or shaky if you miss a meal?
Do you feel tired an hour or so after eating?
Do you get dizzy when you stand suddenly?
Do you experience vertigo (dizziness)?
Do you usually feel fatigued or exhausted?
Do you experience internal trembling?
Are you often confused?
Do you have heart palpitations?
Do you get frequent headaches?
Are you often forgetful?
Do you have frequent crying spells?
Do you have difficulty concentrating?
Do you experience blurred vision?
Do you have depression or mood swings?
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
70

Date:
Yes
No
Do you feel as though you’re going crazy?
Do you have frequent backaches?
Do you often have problems with digestion?
Are you apt to engage in asocial or antisocial behavior?
Are you indecisive?
Do you get frequent leg cramps?
Do you often experience muscle pains or muscular twitching?
Do you often feel lightheaded?
Do you experience numbness?
Do you usually have cold hands and/or feet?
Do you have fainting spells or blackouts?
Do you have convulsions?
Do you experience bloating?
Are you overweight? (See the “Figuring out your BMI” 
sidebar to calculate.)
Scoring: Add 1 for each Yes answer.
<5: Probably not hypoglycemic.
6 to 19: Hypoglycemia is likely.
>20: Hypoglycemia is extremely likely.
This test is a general guideline. If you have diabetics or hypo-
glycemics in your family, you’re probably prone to blood sugar
imbalance and other manifestations of hypoglycemia. Even if you
have only a few severe or recurrent symptoms, you may be hypo-
glycemic. An excellent way to find out whether you’re hypo-
glycemic is to try this chapter’s diet and see whether your
symptoms diminish or clear. Following the diet gives your doc
more info to work with.
See a doctor immediately if you have symptoms such as vertigo,
blurred vision, numbness, blackouts, palpitations, or convulsions.
These symptoms can indicate another, more urgent, health matter.
Chapter 5: Getting the Lowdown on Low Blood Sugar 71

Eating by trial
Trying out the following diet for at least 20 days can give you a
fairly good indication of the likelihood of hypoglycemia. If you start
feeling at least a bit better and some of your symptoms subside
when you’re on this diet, then chances are pretty good that you
have low blood sugar. At this point, you may choose to get yourself
tested (check out the next section), or simply embark on the hypo-
glycemia diet in Chapter 6.
 Avoid all sugars, stimulants, and heavy starch foods — this
includes pasta, bread, corn, rice, and potatoes. (Be sure to
read labels on everything, because prepared foods often con-
tain hidden sugar.)
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
72
Figuring out your BMI
Calculating your body mass index (BMI), a number derived from your height and
weight, is one generally accepted method of finding out whether you’re overweight.
People prone to blood sugar imbalances sometimes have a more difficult time keep-
ing their weight under control. To calculate your BMI:
1. Divide your body weight by 2.2.
For a 150-pound person: 150 ÷ 2.2 = 68.2
2. Divide your height in inches by 39.4.
For a person who is 5’8” (68 inches): 68 ÷ 39.4 = 1.7
3. Multiply your answer for step 2 by itself.
1.7 × 1.7 = 2.9
4. Divide the number from step 1 by the number from step 3.
Your final number is an estimation of your BMI. 68.2 ÷ 2.9 = 23.5. This person’s
BMI is 23.5, which is in the healthy range.
In 1999, the National Institutes of Health issued these revised BMI guidelines:
 Below 18.5: Underweight
 18.5 to 24.9: Healthy
 25 to 29.9: Overweight
 30 or greater: Obese
Bear in mind that BMI measurements for extremely muscular athletes and preg-
nant women aren’t accurate.

 Don’t eat deep fried foods, breading, or sauces, and stay away
from all desserts and fruits.
 Don’t drink alcoholic beverages.
 If you smoke, try to at least cut back.
 You can eat as many vegetables as you like.
This diet is a test to help you find whether the seemingly unrelated
symptoms you have are due to hypoglycemia, which is basically an
underlying metabolic disorder that makes your body incapable of
handling carbs properly. (See Chapters 1 and 2 for more about
what hypoglycemia is.) This diet isn’t the prescribed diet for hypo-
glycemia (although similarities exist), and you don’t have to stay
on it forever. Your symptoms may temporarily worsen in the first
week or so, but they should ease eventually.
Fill out the questionnaire in the previous section again at the end
of the diet’s trial period. If you have fewer symptoms, or if your
symptoms become less intense or disappear, it’s a good indication
that you have hypoglycemia, particularly if you’ve already had all
kinds of medical tests and nothing was found to be wrong.
As with any task worth doing, going on the trial diet may be chal-
lenging, but you can make it easier by exercising (see Chapter 8),
using meditation and deep breathing techniques (see Chapter 9),
and following Chapter 16’s helpful hints for making life more man-
ageable. In fact, you may be pleasantly surprised by how much

Getting the 411 on Hypoglycemia
Testing
We have some bad news: No lab tests can conclusively diagnose
hypoglycemia. That’s because of the controversy over the criteria
for evaluating the test. Looking only at blood sugar values can give
skewed results, flagging healthy people as hypoglycemics; and con-
versely, hypoglycemics may be told they’re healthy — the latter is
a scenario that happens all too frequently. People commonly spend
hundreds or even thousands of dollars on tests that tell them noth-
ing conclusive. Some doctors may question whether your so-called
symptoms are just in your head. And some people have hypo
symptoms even with their lowest numbers in the normal range.
Chapter 5: Getting the Lowdown on Low Blood Sugar 73

Despite the drawbacks, doctors can use lab tests as part of the
diagnostic procedure. Two tests can help diagnose hypoglycemia:
the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and glucose insulin tolerance test
(G-ITT).
Although the GTT can diagnose diabetes and hypoglycemia, these
days, many doctors don’t even consider it the instrument of choice
for diagnosing hypoglycemia. The G-ITT is a standard GTT coupled
with the measurement of insulin levels; it’s much more sensitive in
spotting faulty sugar metabolism. Studies show that people with
suspected diabetes or hypoglycemia who test normal when only
the GTT is taken show up as abnormal on the G-ITT.
This section takes a closer look at these tests and the pros and
cons of your doctor conducting these tests. Furthermore, this sec-
tion walks you through the actual tests so you know what to
expect, and then it helps you interpret the results.
The pros and cons of these tests
The advantages to taking either the GTT or the G-ITT, should the
results indicate that you have an abnormality, include the following:
 If you need to convince your employer or your family and
friends that your hypoglycemia isn’t all in your head, you
have medical documentation for proving your case. (See
Chapter 11 for more about work.)
 The test is likely to motivate you to make dietary changes.
 You can use the results to predict when your blood sugar will
dip, and then you can schedule your snacks accordingly. (For
instance, you can try eating 20 minutes before the predicted
blood sugar drop.)
 The test can indicate whether you need further testing to
determine whether you have a serious organic cause for your
hypoglycemia, such as a tumor of the pancreas. Chances are
that you don’t have cancer of the pancreas, because it’s a rare
condition, but ruling out other causes is always a good idea.
The GTT (and G-ITT) is no picnic in the park. It’s long, it’s stressful,
and for those of you who have a severe case of hypoglycemia, your
symptoms will probably flare up during the test. When given the
GTT or G-ITT, some people may have hypoglycemic symptoms even
though their blood sugar level falls comfortably within the normal
range. An individual may go totally nuts and yet have a virtually
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
74

identical glucose tolerance test reading to someone who’s calm and
collected. Results that are considered normal may not necessarily
be normal for you. Your body may not be able to function properly
with a blood sugar level that doctors consider normal.
If you want to spare yourself the time and expense of taking the
tests, just try out the two-week trial diet in this chapter. Many
hypoglycemia veterans attest that how you feel while you’re on the
diet gives you at least as good a clue to whether you’re hypo-
glycemic as the tests do.
What to expect from the tests
Before you take either the GTT or the G-ITT, find out whether your
insurance will pick up the cost. Most insurance policies cover
GTTs for diabetics; they may also reimburse you if your doctor
confirms a diagnosis of hypoglycemia. But unless you’re enrolled
under a generous policy, chances are that you’ll have to pay 
out-of-pocket.
If you and your doctor decide that one of the glucose tolerance tests
is right for you, the following sections walk you through the tests so
you know what to expect.
Chapter 5: Getting the Lowdown on Low Blood Sugar 75
Surfing to find more testing info
When you’re wondering whether you have hypoglycemia, or if you’ve been recently
diagnosed, you may be curious about the tests your doctor will do, or has done. The
following Web sites explain a bit more about different types of testing your doctor
may perform:
 Genova Diagnostics (www.gdx.net): This lab, which was formerly named the
Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratories, can perform food-allergy tests. The
Web site offers information about the different tests the laboratory performs,
news about the latest lab developments, educational resources, an online book-
store, and a newsletter.
 Health Equations (www.healthequations.com): This site provides nutri-
tional blood testing and information about the testing, as well as articles on
topics such as cholesterol and heart disease.
 Reactive Hypoglycemia Home Page (www.fred.net/slowup/hypo.html):
This home page gives you information about treatments that can help relieve the
symptoms of hypoglycemia. It also provides a good list of resources for those
who want to find out more about the condition.

Pretest
The glucose tolerance tests are usually conducted in the morning,
after you’ve fasted (gone without food) for 10 to 12 hours. Ask a
friend or family member to take you to the clinic and pick you up
after the test. Because you may have severe reactions to the test,
driving home or taking public transportation can be dangerous.
Keep the following in mind:
 Tell your doctor about any prescription meds you’re currently
taking, especially diuretic drugs, anti-epileptic drugs, contra-
ceptives, and drugs containing cortisone or aspirin.
 Arrange to have extra blood samples taken while you’re
having obvious symptoms, such as rapid pulse, sweating, or
sudden weakness, at least 15 minutes before the next blood
sample is drawn. When you get these symptoms, call a nurse
immediately.
 Arrange to get a personal copy of your results.
 Make sure that you get the six-hour test and not the shorter
three-, four-, or even five-hour test. For some individuals,
blood sugar may not fall below the normal level until after the
fourth or fifth hour. Yes, this means that the test will be an all-
day affair. Here’s what you should prepare:
• Good reading materials (for helping pass the time)
• Food to eat when the test is over (to help level out your
blood sugar)
• A notebook or some papers (to help pass the time; also
good for adding to your food journal later)
• A pen (because trying to write with crayons is tough)
• A watch (so you can record your body’s rhythms and
see the light at the end of the testing tunnel)

More blood? Sure, we’ll take it
You can ask for blood to be drawn every half hour to increase the accuracy of the
test, but the test will cost more — and you’ll have many more lovely puncture
wounds on your arms. Something to consider: Instead of having your blood tested
every half hour, make a special request to have a specimen taken after 31⁄2 hours. (It’s
not normally done, so you have to ask.) This specimen can reveal abnormalities that
may be missed otherwise.

You can’t touch any food until the test is over. If you do, the results
are invalidated. You can drink only water.
During the test
So you have on your comfy clothes, you’re clutching a new book,
and your tummy is rumbling. Here’s what to expect when you
show up at the clinic:
1. Blood is drawn to take a baseline blood sugar measure-
ment (the amount of sugar in your bloodstream after an
overnight fast).
The doctor needs to have a baseline measurement in order
to find out what your body does with the sugar. If the
thought of needles freaks you out, refer to Chapter 9 and
practice some of the stress-relieving exercises.
2. You’re given a glucose solution to drink.
It’s presented in a bottle containing about 75 grams of glu-
cose (sugar) in 300 ml (milliliters) of water. You don’t have
to drink it in one gulp, but you want to swallow it reason-
ably quickly; don’t nurse it like a cup of latte. You drink
only this one bottle.
Don’t lie down during the test unless you’re very weak.
Blood sugar tends to remain high if you don’t move at all,
so lying down may skew the results. If possible, walk
around the clinic and stretch out your legs. Just get back in
time for the blood draw.
3. Blood is drawn again at 30 minutes and at 1 hour, and
then hourly for up to 6 hours.
The blood samples are examined for their actual sugar con-
tent at specific intervals. The samples show how your body
utilizes sugar.
4. You’re informed when the test is over.
5. You’re told the results after your doctor gets them from
the lab.
Some patients experience vertigo, disorientation, and other severe
symptoms during the test, although none of these are common.
Some start crying uncontrollably, get into an argument with the
nurse, or otherwise engage in bizarre behavior. If you experience
any of these symptoms, don’t be alarmed.
Write down any symptoms or adverse effects that you experience
during the test, such as dizziness, abdominal cramps, irritability,
depression, and so on, and the time that they occurred. Keeping
track of this info is crucial, because it can aid in interpreting your
Chapter 5: Getting the Lowdown on Low Blood Sugar 77

test results. You’ll be able to compare the reactions that you expe-
rienced during the test to your blood sugar levels at the time of the
reactions. This is a good reason to have someone there with you:
Your companion can note such incidences, even if you’re too far
gone to write anything down.
Post-test
You’re done. Take a breath. You’ll probably be tired after the test,
so don’t schedule anything demanding that night. You may want to
skip your kickboxing class. Of course, if you’re feeling bright and
chipper and raring to go, don’t hold back. Go challenge the neigh-
borhood wrestling champ if you want. As long as it’s legal, feel free
to do whatever you like.
How your doc interprets the results
To interpret the results of the GTT or the G-ITT test, you need to
understand how doctors measure the amount of sugar in the
blood. Results are shown per 100 milliliters (ml) of blood. Here are
the spans for fasting blood sugar levels:
 80–110 mg: The normal span
 110–125 mg: Impaired glucose tolerance
 >126 mg: Raises the suspicion of diabetes
After you swallow the glucose drink, you’re no longer considered to
be fasting. The blood sugar level rises slightly in the healthy indi-
vidual, perhaps to 120 mg, depending on where the fasting level
was, and then falls back to the fasting level. For a short period of
time, the blood sugar level drops slightly below the level it was at
during fasting, and then it returns to normal fairly quickly.
The nonfasting blood sugar levels are recorded after 30 minutes
and then every hour after you drink the glucose beverage:
 <140 mg: Normal
 140–199 mg: Impaired glucose tolerance
 >200 mg: Indicates diabetes
In the diabetic person, blood sugar comes down very slowly, return-
ing to the fasting level after six or more hours. And what about hypo-
glycemics? Unfortunately, the criteria for diagnosing hypoglycemia
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
78

aren’t so clear. Doctors can’t agree on a specific number. However,
hypoglycemia is officially recognized in an individual only if fasting
blood sugar falls below 45 mg during a 72-hour fast. Some doctors
adopt more stringent diagnostic criteria called the Whipple triad.
The patient must satisfy the following requirements before she can
be formally diagnosed as hypoglycemic:
 The glucose levels must fall to less than 40 mg.
 Symptoms of hypoglycemia.
 The hypoglycemic symptoms must be reversed when the glu-
cose levels are returned to normal.
To make an accurate assessment of either the GTT or the G-ITT,
your doctor should observe how fast your blood sugar drops
(rather than how low it drops). Basically, hypoglycemia is sus-
pected if the natural rise is followed by a rapid drop below the
normal fasting range. The lower and faster it drops, the more
severe the condition. A person may experience more problems if
his sugar level drops from 200 mg to 100 mg in one hour or less,
than if it drops from 100 mg to 45 mg in two or three hours.
So, when diagnosing hypoglycemia, consider these factors:
 How fast does the blood sugar level return to normal?
 How long does the sugar level remain at the low point?
For instance, the blood sugar level may drop to a low 45, but if it
recovers quickly and returns to the fasting level in about an hour,
you may not even notice it, or you may experience only mild symp-
toms. You may have more severe symptoms if, say, your blood sugar
drops to 65 mg and remains there for a few hours because it takes
a long time to return to your fasting level.
Chapter 5: Getting the Lowdown on Low Blood Sugar 79
G-ITT this test
In addition to testing your glucose level, we strongly recommend that you have your
insulin or epinephrine level measured at the same time (via the G-ITT), because hypo-
glycemic symptoms often correlate better with elevations of these hormones than
with blood sugar levels. People with hypoglycemia often have food sensitivities that
can contribute to their symptoms, but lab tests for food sensitivities can be quite
expensive. And because there’s so much disagreement about how valid they are, use
the elimination diet. It may clue you in on which foods are causing your problems.

Even if you don’t meet the official criteria to be diagnosed as hypo-
glycemic, you may still experience all the adverse effects due to
your body’s inability to metabolize carbohydrates properly.
Because hypoglycemics have so many different sugar curves, you
should select a doctor who is specifically trained to treat hypo-
glycemia. (Chapter 4 has info on selecting the right doctor.)
Figure 5-1 shows what a hypoglycemic’s curves may look like.
 Line A shows that the glucose level has fallen below 50 mg.
 Line B indicates that the level has fallen below the original
fasting level of 80 mg.
 Line C shows a severe percentage drop in the short term.
 Line D stays above the fasting level of 100 mg for an extended
time.
Graphing your own results
By graphing your own results, you get a pictorial representation of
exactly when your blood sugar falls. Your doctor doesn’t usually
give you a graph; she just tells you the results. If you have a graph,
it’s easier to see just when your blood sugar falls. Also, if you need
to convince someone that you have hypoglycemia, something
visual works better than using just words to explain.
After you have a GTT test performed
1. Ask your doctor to give you a copy of the results of
your test.
2. Chart a graph.
You can see examples in Figures 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, and 5-5.
3. Compare the notes you took during the test to your blood
sugar levels represented on the graph.
4. Go over the results with your doctor.

One picture is worth 1,000 words, so one graph should be good for

give you an idea of what the tests look like. See just how sexy these
glucose tolerance curves can be? You can tell how the rise and fall
of the blood sugar level for diabetes, relative hypoglycemia, and
flat glucose tolerance (considered a type of hypoglycemia) differ
significantly from one another.

 Understanding the importance of nutrition
 Following a specific diet plan
 Determining proper serving sizes
 Sticking with your vegetarian diet
 Keeping a food journal
You may not know it yet, but the road to radiant health is paved
with good foods. Granted, these foods may not be your number
one preference right now, but as you make your way through this
book, your palate and your taste buds will likely change.
Thankfully, treating hypoglycemia is directly linked to changing your
diet. Vitamins and dietary supplements can help (see Chapter 7 for
a complete list), but you don’t need expensive medication to get
results. Making changes to your diet does, however, take work and
commitment. Only you can make the day-to-day changes required to
turn your health around. But as you do so, you’ll be heartened by
the vitality you experience as you recover from the lifestyle that
made you ill. (For more on the concept of recovery, see Chapter 1.)
Depending on where you live, you may not find some of the foods
mentioned in this chapter in regular grocery stores. You can, how-
ever, easily obtain them in natural food stores or large, interna-
tional grocery stores. If you can’t find them, check out the “Using
the Web to help you eat healthy” sidebar in this chapter.
As you embark on your eating plan, try to think in terms of abun-
dance rather than restriction and limitation. Creating a food plan
that takes your biochemical individuality into account helps you
achieve optimum health. This chapter looks at the importance of
eating well and can help you develop an eating plan.

Of Food Pyramids and
Healthy Eating
Do you often get strong cravings for something sweet or starchy: a
candy bar, a bagel, mashed potatoes? Your low blood sugar is driv-
ing you toward something that will give you a boost of energy. If
you cave into your cravings, you can set off a chain of reactions
that culminates in a blood sugar crash — when the blood sugar
level falls below the optimum range in which the body functions.
The fact is that food with white sugar and white flour is absolutely
the worst for blood sugar control. (Check out Chapter 2 for the
scoop on how your body reacts when you eat carbs.) This section
explains the food pyramid and guides you to healthier eating.
Re-designing the familiar pyramid
Many Americans try to eat healthy by eating a high-carb, low-fat,
and low-protein diet or a high-protein, low-carb diet — or what-
ever diet happens to be the most popular. Part of the blame falls
on the old food pyramid recommended by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) and on diet gurus who make extravagant
weight loss claims.
Most Americans are familiar with the old food pyramid. At the base
of the old pyramid were grains, such as rice, wheat, oats, and cer-
eals. The USDA recommended six to eleven servings a day of this
group. Moving upward, the next section featured fruits (two to four
servings) and vegetables (three to five servings). The third section
had dairy products, meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dry beans, and nuts
(two to three servings). At the very top were the fats, oils, and
sweets, which were to be consumed sparingly.
The new dietary guidelines for Americans that were introduced
in 2005 better reflect current nutritional findings, but still remain
inadequate, especially for hypoglycemics. The revised pyramid
allows you to eat up to half of your total grain intake in the form 
of refined starch, and lets you eat sweets. Moreover, it lumps fruit
juices together with fruits. But fruit juices lack the fiber and min-
erals in whole fruits that slow down the release of blood sugar and
help the body absorb the sugar contained in fruits. Fruit juices are
therefore not the same as whole fruits, and are off limits to anyone
suffering from hypoglycemia.
As you can see, the USDA diet — the old one or the new one — is 
a no-no for the hypoglycemic person, because the consumption of
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
86

sweets and refined starch can set off a yo-yo blood sugar syn-
drome. (You can partially offset this yo-yo effect by eating enough
fat and protein, but that may add up to way too many calories!
Anyway, too many carbs aren’t good for you.) Many people who go
too low on fats and protein experience the following problems:
 Constant hunger
 Cravings for starch and sugar
 Deficiencies in calcium and vitamins A, D, E, and K
 A liver impairment for dealing with toxins
Despite these flaws, the USDA’s revised food pyramid is an improve-
ment over the old one because it shows a swath of six-colored rays
that indicate food groups to emphasize and to minimize, instead of a
fixed number of servings in each food group, which doesn’t take into
account individual differences. The pyramid also stresses the impor-
tance of exercise by drawing a person running up the steps of the
pyramid.
To help stabilize your blood sugar, eat some protein with every
meal or snack. (An exception to this rule is fruits. Some people
experience digestive discomfort when they mix fruit with protein.
Not everyone does, so experiment and see what works best for
you.) Carbs affect your blood sugar the most, because they’re
easily digested and transformed into glucose. By contrast, protein
is digested much slower. Eating some protein slows digestion and
helps stabilize blood sugar. When it comes to your blood sugar,
carbs really count. (We provide a list of foods that contain protein
later in this chapter.)
Building a hypoglycemic pyramid
If you’re hypoglycemic, and you want a healthy diet, just reshape
the old pyramid a bit as shown in Figure 6-1. Hypoglycemics have
their very own food pyramid! We use the old one as a model rather
than the new one, because the colored rays representing the differ-
ent food groups aren’t as easy to take in at a glance. MyPyramid
depends on the Web site for details and an interactive computer
game to help users understand the food recommendations. We’d
rather keep things as simple as possible.
So, at the base are fresh fruits and vegetables (more veggies than
fruits). The next section contains high-quality, low-fat protein (lean
cuts of beef or skinless chicken). These two groups should fill up
most of the pyramid. Dairy is there, if you can tolerate dairy. Stick
to two to three servings. Near the top are breads, grains, and pasta,
Chapter 6: Gorging on Good Health 87

which are to be seldom eaten. Fats and oils occupy the uppermost,
narrow portion of the pyramid. The majority of your carb needs are
met by fresh, nutrient-dense fruits and leafy-green veggies.
Figure 6-1: This pyramid is for the hypoglycemic.
If you use this hypoglycemic food pyramid as your guide, keep the
following things in mind:
 Carbohydrates should comprise 40 to 60 percent of your total
calories. Nutritionally speaking, eating complex carbs (whole
wheat bread) is better than eating simple carbs (white bread).
But before you go on an eating spree of all-organic, all-natural,
whole-wheat cakes and breads, consider this: Even complex
carbs have the tendency to raise your blood sugar and trigger
excess insulin production. Restrict your total carbohydrate
intake. And if you’re at all wheat sensitive, you have to elimi-
nate wheat-based foods, such as bread and pasta. (Flip to
Chapter 3 for details on food sensitivities.)
 Protein should comprise 15 to 30 percent of your total calo-
ries. Remember, though, that although protein occupies a sig-
nificant portion of your diet, it should by no means outstrip
your carbohydrate intake. Aim for regular and consistent pro-
tein intake, not a high protein intake.
 Unless your doctor puts you on a special diet, you should
strive to get about 15 to 20 percent of your calories from fats.

Keeping your diet in balance
The key to using the modified food pyramid for hypoglycemia is
keeping things balanced. Here are some clues that you may be get-
ting too much or too little of the different food groups and what
you can do to fix the situation.
Too much protein, too few carbs
Depending on body size, the maximum amount of protein a person
can tolerate is about 200 to 300 grams a day. If you experience the
following symptoms, you’re most likely eating too much protein
and not enough carbs:
 Nervousness
 Irritability
 Jitters
 Overall feeling of weakness
 Compulsion to overeat
If you do experience these symptoms, they’ll most likely clear up in
a few days (several weeks at most) after you add carbs to your diet.
Too much protein can pose these health problems:
 Damage to the liver, kidneys, and brain
 Calcium deficiency
 Gouty arthritis (a painful condition of the joints caused by
excess uric acid in certain tissues)
Too little fat (believe it or not)
Most people love fat. And no wonder — fat gives foods a pleasant
mouth feel and can taste pretty good too. Just look at the industry
sales of high-fat ice creams and other fatty foods like chips and
French fries. Although too much fat is unhealthy and can lead to
weight gain if consumed in excess, in general, fats
 Help your body function properly
 Slow down the rate at which carbs enter your bloodstream
 Give you the feeling of being full
 Release a hormone that signals your brain to stop eating
Chapter 6: Gorging on Good Health 89

If you’re hypoglycemic and you don’t consume enough fat (about
15 to 20 percent of your diet), you may start craving starches and
run the risk of eating too much. But wait! Don’t run out just yet for
your favorite fast food fix. First read the “The squeaky hypo-
glycemic gets the grease: Fats” section for more info.
Shunning problematic foods
Food has the ability not only to make you sick but also to heal. In
the case of hypoglycemia, the key to successful treatment is
through the elimination — not the addition — of certain foods.
Avoiding foods that wreak havoc on your system has the greatest
impact on your health — as much impact as (or more than) what
you eat or what supplements you take.
This section includes a list of foods and beverages that you should
avoid. After you follow this outline for awhile and your body
becomes stronger, you can expand your diet and even cheat occa-
sionally. When you’re transitioning to a healthier diet, be as careful
as possible. If you usually inhale the typical Western diet, many
familiar foods (perhaps your all-time favorites) may be included in
the huh-uh list. Don’t despair, though. You don’t have to follow the
recovery program perfectly for it to work.
These are the foods that you should shun:
 Sugar (including white, brown, raw, and turbinado).
 Refined flour (white, bleached, unbleached, and enriched)
and everything made from it. Generally speaking, if it looks
white, it’s white flour! Read labels, avoiding anything not
made from whole grains. And don’t be misled by white bread
colored brown masquerading as whole wheat. Wheat flour, for
instance, contains refined flour. If the first ingredient doesn’t
say whole wheat, the bread goes back on the shelf.
 Polished rice (white rice) and any kind of instant rice.
 Processed proteins (lunchmeats, sausages, bacon, hot dogs —
anything with additives or preservatives).
 Processed cheese (cheese made by combining one or more
natural cheeses with an emulsifying agent, and then heating
and mixing it; American cheese is processed).
 Coffee, black tea, and anything else with caffeine (including
chocolate).
 Soft drinks (carbonated drinks, including all colas).
 Alcohol.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia

 MSG (monosodium glutamate). Everyone, but especially meta-
bolically sensitive individuals like hypoglycemics, should
avoid this seasoning. Other names for MSG include hydrolyzed
protein, caseinate, soy extract, yeast extract, meat tenderizer,
Accent, and Ajinomoto.

After checking the list of foods to avoid, you may feel that you’re
forced to make the grim choice of either never enjoying eating
again, or living the rest of your life in compromised health. In fact,
you don’t have to do either. Eating a wide variety of foods — within
the constraints of your hypoglycemic diet — ensures that you’re
getting the proper balance of vitamins and minerals (which we dis-
cuss in depth in Chapter 7).
Most people forget that healthy food is also truly good-tasting
food. You can eat lots of delicious foods; moreover, when you
embark on your recovery program, unhealthy foods start losing
their appeal. Although you may always hear the siren call of your
favorite forbidden foods, it becomes more muted over time;
besides, you’ll have so much more zest for life that you’ll want to
get right back on course. This section looks at the healthful foods
that you want to eat to lessen your hypoglycemia symptoms.
Chapter 6: Gorging on Good Health 91
Darned if you do, darned if you donut
Donuts and danishes spell disaster when it comes to your blood sugar. Muffins (even
if they’re low-fat) and bagels, which seem to be healthy alternatives, spike your
blood sugar just as high and just as rapidly. This is also true for most breakfast cere-
als (if you’re going to eat sugar-coated cereal, you may as well have a candy bar)
and muesli, a Swiss breakfast cereal consisting of rolled oats, nuts, and fruits.
Health food stores carry all sorts of cereals that actually contain some good vitamins,
but these, too, are best avoided, especially in the early days of your recovery. If you
do eat these types of cereal, make sure that you choose the ones that have no added
sugar of any sort, no additives, and lots of fiber. Slow-cooked oatmeal is a healthy
choice, particularly if you throw in some crunchy, protein-rich nuts or seeds. (Steer
clear of instant oats and other instant foods, which convert almost instantly into blood
glucose.) Steel cut oats — the inner portion of the oat kernel — are best. They con-
tain more nutrients, because they’re less processed than quick, instant, or rolled oats.
Steel cut oats, which are also called Scotch oats or Irish oatmeal, are chewier, have
more texture, and are slower to cook. They’re available at health food stores.

Life’s a bowl of cherries: Fruits
Fruits are yummy, not to mention rich in nutrients and all kinds of
beneficial compounds. And they’re just the thing to eat if you want
something sweet.
The sugar in fruit is called fructose, and it appears that fructose
doesn’t cause as rapid a rise in blood sugar as simple sugars.
Fructose has to be changed to glucose in the liver before it can be
used by the body, so the rise in your blood sugar is more moderate
when you eat fruits. The fiber in fruits also helps keep the blood
sugar from rising too quickly. Besides, fruits can help control sugar
cravings (instead of triggering them, like processed snacks do). In
addition, fruits have vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that aid in
digestion. But don’t consume fructose alone, without the fruit,
because then it’s almost as bad as table sugar.

Fruits to avoid, especially when you’re in the initial stages of recov-
ery, include the following:
 Bananas
 Dates
 Figs
 Raisins and other dried fruits (After you’re feeling better, you
may occasionally eat small amounts after soaking them in
water or cooking with cereal. As a general rule, avoid dried
fruits.)
If you have digestive problems associated with eating fruits with
your meals, try eating fruit half an hour before a meal, or two to
three hours afterward. Fruit contains a lot of fiber, so it shouldn’t
cause a blood sugar spike even if you eat it by itself. (Melons don’t
seem to combine well with other foods or even other fruits. Eat
melons by themselves, separately from other foods.)
Try fruits that have a lower glycemic index (GI), because they won’t
raise your blood glucose as much. (Check out www.glycemicindex.
com for a list of fruits with a low GI.) If even the low GI fruits seem to
give you trouble, skip fruits altogether; some hypoglycemics in the
earliest part of recovery can’t metabolize them properly.
Vegging out isn’t a bad thing
Your mother was right: You need to eat your veggies. Do you want
to be free of distressing hypoglycemic symptoms? Eat your vegeta-
bles. Do you want to combat aging and look and feel young for as
long as possible? Eat your vegetables. Do you want your brain to
remain sharp, clear, and focused? Eat your vegetables.
Vegetables carry a greater nutritional wallop than most man-made
vitamins or supplements. They’re chock full of vitamins, minerals,
protein, high-quality carbs, essential fatty acids, antioxidants, fiber,
and a host of other health-promoting substances that scientists are
only beginning to unravel. Veggies, especially green ones, are a real
boon for people battling blood sugar imbalance because they’re rich
in essential fatty acids, such as Omega-3 oils. Vegetables are blood
sugar neutral, meaning they don’t trigger increases in insulin or
blood sugar.
Eating the best veggies in the best state (raw, that is)
Always try to eat fresh vegetables in their raw state, because
cooking destroys some of the nutrients. On the other hand, some
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
94

vegetables, such as asparagus, cauliflower, and cabbage, may pro-
mote better digestion when lightly cooked. Raw spinach can inter-
fere with calcium absorption, so if you do eat it raw, make sure that
you don’t consume it with calcium-rich foods. For variety, you can
steam, sauté, stir-fry, bake, boil, or grill your veggies. Just be care-
ful not to cook the life out of them. You can eat the following veg-
gies in their raw form as often as you like:
 Bell peppers
 Celery
 Cucumbers
 Iceberg lettuce
 Parsley
 Radishes
 Romaine lettuce
 Turnips
 Watercress
Other veggies vying for your attention include
 Garlic and onions: These veggies are of special interest to
hypoglycemics and diabetics because they contain special
sugar-regulating factors. They also reduce LDL (“bad”) choles-
terol and lower blood pressure. See Controlling Cholesterol For
Dummies, by Carol Ann Rinzler (Wiley), for more info on man-
aging your cholesterol.
 Artichokes and string beans: These vegetables are excellent
for both the hypoglycemic and the diabetic. Artichokes
improve blood circulation and mobilize energy reserves.
However, they contain 10 to 14 percent carbs, so eat about a
quarter of a whole artichoke, and never more than one a day.
String beans contain an insulin-like hormone and work as a
sugar balancer.
 Sprouts and sea vegetables: Sprouts make good convenience
foods, because they’re easy to grow and inexpensive, and you
can throw them in many dishes, such as soups and salads, to
suit your taste. If you want to grow sprouts, you can buy the
seeds at health food stores. You can use kelp in soups or for
making stock, and sheets of seaweeds (like the sheets of nori
that sushi rolls are wrapped in) are handy, versatile, and rich
in trace minerals. Make sure that you buy unsweetened sea-
weeds. They’re available in most health food stores and Asian
markets.
Chapter 6: Gorging on Good Health 95

Make sure you get enough veggies
Remember that a good minimum is eight servings of veggies daily.
However, the ideal amount is anywhere from 10 to 15 servings.
Some veggie-happy experts even recommend that for every 50
pounds of body weight, you should eat a pound of raw veggies.
(Check out the “Building a hypoglycemic pyramid” section earlier
for more specifics.)
How can anyone get such a high proportion of vegetables into
their daily diet? It’s easier than you may think. Try these ideas:
 Blend your vegetables into smoothies, possibly adding one or
two fresh fruits for a scrumptious taste treat.
 Make juice from your vegetables. You can mix different vegeta-
bles or add a fruit or two. (Avoid juicing only fruits because
fruit juices are too high in sugar and trigger a too-rapid
increase in your blood sugar.)
If your diet consists mainly of wilted lettuce, mashed potatoes, and
overcooked or canned vegetables, or if you think ketchup is a veg-
etable, you’re in for a culinary surprise. Try opening your taste
buds to a cornucopia of delights with the dark and leafy greens,
and the vivid reds, oranges, yellows, and purples. (The brightly
colored ones contain more antioxidants — substances that protect
you from the free radicals that damage cells.)
The squeaky hypoglycemic 
gets the grease: Fats
Fats have gotten an undeservedly bad rap in recent years. Too
much of the wrong kind of fats is bad, but you do need fats. Your
brain is, after all, approximately 70 percent fat. (So if someone calls
you a fathead, he’s merely stating the truth!) Without fats, you
suffer from nerve damage and decreased brain function, not to
mention other afflictions, such as hormonal abnormalities and car-
diovascular disease. Two fats you should know about are
 Saturated fats: These “bad” fats are found in red meat and
high-fat dairy products. You do need some saturated fats, but
not very much.
 Unsaturated fats: These “good” fats are found in things
like nuts.
The following sections detail which fats you do need and which
ones you don’t.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
96

Fats you need
In order to function properly, the body needs essential fatty acids
(EFAs). They’re essential because they have to come from outside
sources — the body can’t manufacture them. The long-chain
Omega-3 fats from fish and fish oil are particularly beneficial,
but they’re woefully deficient in the modern diet. Cold-water fish,
such as salmon, trout, tuna, and sardines, provide abundant
sources of Omega-3 fats. You can also get them from flaxseed oil,
chopped walnuts, or eggs that have been enriched with Omega-3.
However, fish oil can favorably change the metabolism of fats and
carbohydrates — a definite advantage for hypoglycemics who
don’t tolerate carbs very well.
Although fish is an excellent source of Omega-3 and full of impor-
tant nutrients, today’s fish supply is often contaminated with mer-
cury. This contamination means that larger, predatory fish such as
swordfish and shark have unacceptably high levels of mercury.
Pregnant women and children younger than 6 should avoid fish
altogether. Precaution is recommended for everyone else. A free,
online calculator (www.gotmercury.org) lets you see which par-
ticular seafood is safe to eat.
The best way to get good fats is to drizzle flaxseed oil on your
salads, eat fatty, cold-water fish like salmon, and eat avocados (in
moderation if you’re trying to lose weight). Don’t worry about get-
ting too much fat if you’re eating lean meats and limiting your con-
sumption of dairy products. The excess fat in most people’s diets
comes from junk food.
If you’re cooking, the best oil to use is coconut oil because high
temperatures don’t damage it. Coconut oil is a saturated fat that’s
coming back into favor after many years. Some naturopathic med-
ical doctors recommend coconut oil as particularly beneficial to
hypoglycemics because it has a normalizing effect on blood sugar.
Fats you don’t
Although too much saturated fat may be bad, trans fatty acids
(trans fat for short) and altered vegetable fats are extremely
destructive and should be avoided. Trans fats have been dubbed
metabolic poison because they not only elevate your total and LDL
(“bad”) cholesterol level, but also lower HDL (“good”) cholesterol.
Trans fatty acids are artificial fatty acids that block the natural
fatty acids. Margarine and many processed snack foods like cakes,
cookies, and fries contain these trans fats. (Read the labels and
stay away from them.)
Chapter 6: Gorging on Good Health 97

Powering up with proteins
Eat some protein at every meal. It ensures slow sugar absorption
and helps prevent hypoglycemic symptoms. We’re not talking
about a huge amount of protein; just a regular, consistent intake to
help balance your blood sugar. For a balanced diet, make sure that
you obtain your protein from different sources instead of confining
yourself to a handful of items that show up in different guises.
The preferred protein sources for hypoglycemics are
 Nuts (macadamia, hazelnut, walnut)
 Seeds (flax, sesame, pumpkin)
 Nut butter (also Tahini and sesame butter)
 Eggs (from free-range chickens)
 Fish and seafood
 Chicken (with the skin removed)
 Turkey (with the skin removed)
 Game meats (rabbit, venison, buffalo, game birds)
 Organ meats (chicken and beef liver)
 Lean meats (organic meats; occasionally pork, if at all)
Meat in the middle (of your whole-wheat bread)
Organic meat comes from livestock raised without hormones and
antibiotics. Antibiotics can precipitate hypoglycemia, and hor-
mones may have adverse effects on your health and are better
avoided. Try to find meat from grass-fed livestock; it’s richer in
Omega-3.
You can find organic and grass-fed meat at health food stores. If
you can’t find any health food stores near your home, check out
the sidebar “Using the Web to help you eat healthy” in this chapter.
(Of course, if you buy organic meat, you can’t just cook it any way
you want. Deep frying it or coating it with white flour won’t do
your hypoglycemia much good.)
Whaddaya, nuts?
Nuts and seeds provide high-quality protein in addition to min-
erals, fiber, and vitamins E and B-complex, which protect against
stress and are involved in mechanisms for blood sugar control.
(Chapter 7 has more on minerals and vitamins.)
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
98

Perhaps you’re afraid to eat nuts because you’re concerned about
weight. If so, the results of a study of a large group of Americans
should put your mind at rest. The study showed that the people
who ate the most nuts tended to be less obese (probably because
the high amounts of fat and protein in nuts produce a feeling of
fullness). Of course, no one is suggesting that eating as many nuts
as you want all day long is going to lead to weight reduction!
You can eat two to three servings of nuts per day. One serving is
roughly ten whole almonds or peanuts, six walnuts, or two pecans.
One serving of seeds is about one tablespoon. Choose nuts with-
out cracks, stains, or splits. Try to purchase them unshelled, raw,
and unsalted. If you have to get them shelled, buy whole nuts (not
crushed or slivered). Keep them in the fridge and eat them fresh.
Doing dairy
Don’t consume more than two to three servings of dairy per day.
Eliminate it completely if your hypoglycemic symptoms are severe.
Livestock are given antibiotics, which get into the dairy products
and encourage the growth of yeasts and fungi that can precipitate
allergies, sugar cravings, and hypoglycemia. You can resume eating
modest amounts of dairy products after your condition has stabi-
lized. Good sources of dairy are plain, unsweetened whole milk,
full-fat yogurt, and raw, organic cheeses.
Breaking the proverbial camel’s
back: Breads and grains
Carbohydrates are of great interest to hypoglycemics — and dia-
betics — because they bear the greatest impact on blood sugar
levels. Eating the right kinds of carbs in the right amounts is criti-
cal in blood sugar management.
Classifying carbs
Carbohydrates can be either simple or complex.
 Simple carbs — such as sugar, refined flour, and white rice —
are essentially sugars, and they spike your blood sugar rapidly.
Simply put, simple carbs are the worst foods for blood sugar
control. They’re quick burning fuel that skyrockets your blood
sugar, only to let it crash, leaving you with low energy and a
craving for more sugar and simple carbs. That’s why sugars fall
into the ugly category of foods that do more harm than good.
Chapter 6: Gorging on Good Health 99

The simple avoidance of simple carbs lessens the immediate
impact of hypoglycemic symptoms, but to enjoy long-term,
radiant good health, your body must obtain the proper nutri-
ents. In short, there is no substitute for wholesome foods.
 Complex carbs take longer for the body to break down into
glucose, and therefore they deliver sugar steadily, making it
more likely that blood sugar is stabilized. For the hypo-
glycemic, this point can’t be overemphasized. Whole grains
and legumes are slow carbs that release glucose at a slower
rate and let you down a little more gently. One caveat: Even
complex carbs cause problems if you consume too much.
Whole grains and legumes are complex carbohydrates. Refined
grains have their germ and bran removed, which partially or
totally eliminates at least 36 nutrients. Whole grains, by con-
trast, retain these nutrients.
Sticking to complex carbs
Because carbs have a profound effect on your blood sugar level,
choose your carbs as wisely as you choose your friends. Whenever
possible, choose complex carbs over simple carbs, and choose
fruits and vegetables over grains.
Whole grains include the following:
 Amaranth
 Brown rice
 Buckwheat
 Quinoa
 Unhulled millet
 Unpearled barley
 Whole oats
 Whole wheat
Legumes provide two to four times as much protein as grains.
They also help improve liver function and blood sugar control.
They include
 Black eyed peas
 Chickpeas
 Garbanzo beans
 Kidney beans
 Lentils
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
100

 Lima beans
 Pinto beans
You can find grains and legumes in natural food stores. They’re
often sold in bulk, so you can easily find the right ones by just
looking at the labels — or by asking a store clerk. (If you can’t find
them in bulk, look for them in packages or cartons with labels.)
Eating the Right Way
Eating right is the key to reducing your hypoglycemia symptoms
and possibly even eliminating them all together. We wager that
you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how good you feel after you
embark on your recovery program.
This section covers the importance of eating the right way, starting
with eating smaller meals, smaller serving sizes, and a healthy
breakfast. This section also gives you some helpful pointers that
provide just the essential info so you can start eating better.
Starting off on the right foot
The beginning of any program is crucial because it sets the founda-
tion. It can mean the difference between success and failure. For
the hypoglycemic in particular, starting right is important because
if you do, you’ll have the incentive to stay on track because your
symptoms are likely to start abating quite quickly.
What to do initially
When you begin your hypoglycemia-eating program, take the fol-
lowing steps to help ensure success:
 Limit fruits to two servings a day. As your condition
improves, you can eat four to five servings a day. (A serving is
one small orange or apple.) However, if you have a strong
craving for sweets, and you feel like you’re going to break
down and gorge on forbidden pastries (like chocolate cake),
grab a fruit — even if it means exceeding your daily quota.
 Exercise caution with the carbs from bread, cereal, rice, and
pasta. When you begin your dietary program, you can get faster
results by completely eliminating this group. After a month or
two, you can reintroduce these foods into your diet. Even then,
limit them to no more than four servings per day — two serv-
ings a day, ideally. If you start experiencing hypoglycemic
symptoms, cut back immediately.
Chapter 6: Gorging on Good Health 101

 Eat mostly raw foods. Gradually add more raw vegetables and
fruit to your diet until you’re consuming about one-third of
your foods raw. Doing so ensures that you’re getting enzymes
and essential micronutrients that cooking destroys.
 Consume more vegetables. Vegetables should be a regular
part of each meal. (Check out “Eating the best veggies in the
best state [raw, that is]” earlier in this chapter.) However, be
careful about which vegetables you eat. In the initial phase of
your recovery, eliminate potatoes and cut back on root veg-
etables that grow underground because they have a high
amount of starch.
 Drink enough water. How much depends on various factors
such as your weight, your health, how active you are, and
where you live. The more active you are, the more fluid you
need. You also need to drink more if you live in hot, humid
climates, or if you’re running a fever. In general, drink between
9 to 13 cups of water a day. If you rarely feel thirsty, and your
urine is colorless or slightly yellow, you’re probably drinking
enough.
 Maintain a regular sleep and wake schedule seven days a
week. Nothing sabotages your progress faster than lack of
sleep. Sleep deprivation can make you reach for a candy bar or
something equally sugary. When you have low blood sugar at
night, it keeps you from sleeping well and gives you nightmares.
To avoid such a scenario, eat a bit of protein before you go to
bed, but make sure it’s a very small portion that doesn’t pro-
mote weight gain. (Taking magnesium supplements can also
help promote sound sleep and help prevent diabetes.)
As a general rule, aim for at least 30 percent protein and 30 percent
fat early in your program. As you progress in your recovery, cut
back on protein and increase your consumption of carbs. Do so
gradually, noting any reappearance of symptoms.
Touching base: How are you doing?
If you stick to your food plan, by the end of the third or fourth
month, you should be generally clear of most hypoglycemic symp-
toms, although a more complete recovery may take six months or
longer. For some individuals, the improvements start within the
first month, or as early as the first couple of weeks. (Again, bear in
mind the individual differences among people.) When you’re clear
of most of your symptoms, you should be eating 25 percent pro-
tein, 50 percent carbs, and 25 percent good fats. One-third to one-
half of the fats in each meal should be in the form of essential fatty
acids, and you should have 35 to 45 grams of dietary fiber a day.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
102

Dr. Colleen Huber, a naturopath with extensive experience treating
hypoglycemics, believes that some symptoms of hypoglycemia
may, in fact, be caused by the lack of fiber in the diet. Therefore,
incorporate fiber into your diet. You may start out on the higher
end of the fat and protein consumption guidelines when you
embark on the program for recovery and then gradually begin cut-
ting back.
This dietary plan is for hypoglycemics. Diabetics can generally eat
diets designed for hypoglycemics. However, if you’re diabetic, you
must be vigilant about serving sizes and food exchanges. For more
information, see Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, by Alan L. Rubin,
MD (Wiley).
Eating six meals — or more — a day
The good news is that being hypoglycemic means never having to
say you’re hungry. That’s because you get to eat three small meals
and three snacks (or six small meals if you prefer) at two to three
hour intervals. Some individuals may need to eat even more fre-
quently, eight or more times a day. (See the nearby sidebar,
“Snacking it up,” if you need ideas for healthy snacks.)
Start out with six meals a day, and gauge how you feel. Do you feel
shaky and hungry? Then eat more often. Time yourself to work out
what best suits your needs. The object is to ensure that your blood
sugar never drops too low. Even if you don’t have much of an
appetite, you shouldn’t let too many hours go without eating —
except when you’re sleeping. But remember to make your meals
and snacks correspondingly smaller (or lower in calories), or you’ll
end up gaining weight!
The most important meal
A blood-sugar balanced day begins with a good breakfast. Don’t
omit eating a good breakfast if you suffer from hypoglycemia. You
want to eat either immediately or shortly after you wake up, prefer-
ably within an hour, and definitely not longer than two hours. (For
more on the dilemma, check out the sidebar, “Darned if you do,
darned if you donut” in this chapter.)
Breakfast seems to have the biggest impact on blood sugar. In addi-
tion, eating the right foods for breakfast sets the tone for the rest
of the day. Some good foods include plain, unsweetened, whole-fat
yogurt, a hard-boiled egg, or oatmeal cooked with an egg. Stay
away from traditional breakfast foods such as bacon, pancakes,
donuts, or bagels.
Chapter 6: Gorging on Good Health 103

If you’re in the habit of exercising and/or meditating for more than
an hour before breakfast, take some protein powder before your
workout to prevent a blood sugar drop. If you don’t, you may be
tempted to gobble down anything that gives you instant energy.
(Protein powder is a concentrated form of protein that you can
drink like a shake. Read labels to make sure that the protein
powder you choose doesn’t have any added sugars. You can get
powdered whey protein, soy protein, or an alternative vegetarian
protein powder at health food stores or on the Internet.)
Don’t feel like having breakfast? Then at least eat a small amount of
food, like a few tablespoons of plain, whole-fat yogurt immediately
after waking up.
Sizing up your servings
When you’re sticking to a healthy diet, you need to watch your serv-
ing sizes (for info on what you should eat, see “Of Food Pyramids
and Healthy Eating,” earlier in this chapter). You’re ahead of the
game if you’re familiar with serving sizes. Fear not if you haven’t a
clue what a serving platter is (much less a serving size).
You don’t have to measure your foods precisely: You’re not con-
ducting a chemical experiment! You probably won’t be able to stick
with a diet that requires you to accurately weigh or measure every-
thing you eat. Besides, you’d look pretty silly if you pulled out a
scale when eating out.
Think of one serving as roughly
 1 slice whole grain bread
 1⁄2 cup oatmeal or other cooked whole grains
 1 cup carrots
 1⁄2 cup beans, peas, or lentils
 1⁄2 cup corn
 1 small apple, orange, or pear
 1 medium peach or nectarine
 1⁄2 banana
 1⁄2 cup pineapple
 1⁄4 melon
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
104

To familiarize yourself with a serving size, measure some foods
you eat. That way, you’ll have a visual estimate of how much
you’re eating. According to the American Dietetic Association
(ADA), most people overestimate serving sizes. Table 6-1 offers
the ADA’s helpful visual comparisons for estimating one serving
size.

Getting back on the wagon
if you’ve fallen off
What if you’ve been down this primrose path before, eating six,
eight, even eleven times a day, and you’re still not finding the relief
you want? How can you get back on this diet and stick with it?
Remember these simple pointers:
 Make sure you’re eating regularly and not skipping any
meals or snacks. Don’t wait until you’re hungry to eat.
 Set up a timer or other reminders. You can easily get
immersed in whatever you’re doing and forget to eat at regu-
lar intervals.
 See whether eating even more frequently helps. Each
person is different. Perhaps you need to eat even more often
than most people in order to keep your blood sugar on an
even keel. The only way to find out is by experimenting.
 Review your diet to see whether you’ve really and truly
been following the basic hypoglycemia diet. Have you
eliminated all simple carbs? Are you getting enough fiber?
Protein? Vegetables? (This is why a food journal is so impor-
tant; refer to “Chewing on a Food Journal” later in this chapter
for more info.)

You may be slipping without even knowing. Be very honest. And
remember, your symptoms may persist for awhile. Although every
individual is different, you may notice a significant difference in six
weeks.
Adding helpful food substitutes
To reduce the intake of carbohydrates — especially that of grains —
substitute vegetables for grains. Try the following subs:
 Bread substitutes: Use greens such as romaine lettuce as
wraps. You can also use cabbage, celery, cucumber, and other
raw vegetables.
 Rice substitute: Steam a head of cauliflower until soft and
mash it up a bit.
 Soup thickeners: Powdered kuzu from kuzu root (good as
cooking starch; also soothes digestive disorders), arrow root,
and potato starch are good options.
 Milk substitutes: Try rice, almond, and hazelnut milk with no
added sweetener. You can also drink soy milk occasionally.
 Wheat flour substitutes for people with wheat allergies: Try
kamut, millet (makes baked goods coarse and dry), barley
(may contain some gluten), brown rice (tends to be crumbly),
corn, quinoa, amaranth, and spelt. Buckwheat and oat flour
may be used for variety, but they do contain some gluten.

Snacking it up
Most hypoglycemics benefit from eating every two to three hours. Here are some
ideas for snacks:
 Nut butter, miso, or hummus spread on celery, cucumber, or other vegetables.
Some people enjoy almond butter on apples.
 Plain nuts and seeds. These are good alone or combined.
 Japanese rice crackers.
 Baked apples with a dollop of butter.
 Baked sweet potato.
 Hot azuki soup sweetened with stevia (simply cook azuki beans in water, and
then add stevia).
 A small portion of leftovers from a meal.

When baking, experiment by adding more water. If the mixture
is too dry, add an egg. Some flours work well in combination.
For instance, kamut can be mixed with spelt.
 Coffee substitutes: Health food stores carry many delicious
grain coffees and other healthy substitutes. (Check out
Chapter 11 for more coffee substitutes.)
Hypoglycemia in Vegetarians:
What Can You Eat?
So you skip the animal flesh. No eggs or dairy, either? You have to
make sure that you get enough protein and avoid eating too many
grains and carbohydrates. Hypoglycemics may have a higher pro-
tein need in the initial stages of their recovery. Consider trying
some of the following to make sure you get enough protein:
 Legumes: A traditional source of protein is legumes (such as
beans and lentils), which were known as “the poor man’s
meat” in the early part of the 19th century. Be aware, however,
that they’re much higher in carbohydrates than they are in
protein, so they should be supplemented with other protein
sources; at the same time, you need to go easy on eating other
forms of carbs so that you don’t get a carb-overload.
 Fish: If you’re not a strict vegetarian, fish can be an excellent
way to complement your diet as long as you eat no more than
one serving per week, and you choose varieties that are rela-
tively free of mercury.
 Soy foods: Foods such as tofu (bean curd) and tempeh (cheese-
like cooked beans) are extremely versatile, and you can make
literally hundreds of dishes with various forms of soy. No
wonder it’s the preferred source of protein for many vegetar-
ians, as well as health-conscious meat-eaters. But too much 
of a good thing can compromise your health. Recent research
appears to show that soybeans may be a bit of a mixed bag.
Until the final verdict comes in, here’s what we recommend:
• Limit your intake to no more than two to three servings
of whole soy foods a day.
• Avoid eating soy every day of the week.
• Eat more fermented soy products, such as miso and
natto. Fermentation achieves a biochemical transforma-
tion that neutralizes the objectionable ingredients in soy.
 Raw seeds: Eat them with or without nuts.
Chapter 6: Gorging on Good Health 107

 Algae: Spirulina and chlorella are also sources of protein.
Chlorella in particular regulates blood sugar and helps to
reduce the craving for carbs.
Supplement your diet with fish oil capsules or flaxseed oil so that
you get enough essential fatty acids (EFAs). Walnuts are also good
sources of these EFAs. You may also add an occasional egg or natu-
ral cheese. To help end cruelty to animals, look for eggs from free-
range chickens (ones that aren’t cooped up).
Chewing on a Food Journal
Keeping a daily food journal is the backbone of your recovery
process and of personalizing the general plan. The object of the food
journal is to help you see exactly what you’re doing. It helps you
become aware of the foods and beverages you’re consuming. With a
journal, you can start to see the connection between what goes into
your mouth and your moods, feelings, and bodily sensations.
Find a notebook that you like and feel comfortable using. You can
get a regular notebook, or you can purchase something that’s con-
structed of handmade paper or bound in leather. If you prefer,
carry around large index cards or loose paper, and then staple
them together at the end of the week. Make sure that you write the
date clearly on each card or page. You can also use a micro-cas-
sette recorder; if you do, we still recommend that you transcribe
everything onto paper at the end of the day (or several days) so
you can reference it later and track your progress.
This section explains what a food journal can do for you and how
you can use it to keep focused on your diet.
Knowing what to record
When you keep your daily food journal, make sure that you write
down the following things:
 Exactly what you eat and drink.
 What exercises you engage in (check out Chapter 8).
 Your feelings, both physical and emotional. Rating your feel-
ings on a scale of 1 to 10, from the least to the most intense,
may be helpful. (Check out the next section for more info.)
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
108

 Anything else that seems relevant (you may also want to add
comments).
 An overall rating for the entire day, again on a scale of 1 to 10.
Doing so makes it easier to note any progress or setbacks.
By recording this information, you can make your journal a helpful
resource. You journal can also
 Keep you focused and aware of what you’re eating and
drinking and how you’re feeling. It can help keep you on
track. (Check out the section “Tracking your progress” later in
this chapter.)
 Prevent you from engaging your mental autopilot and con-
suming foods unconsciously. If you park yourself in front of
the TV, it’s very easy to eat a bag of chips or guzzle down an
entire six-pack without really being aware of what you’re
doing.
 Help you keep track of food-related symptoms and identify
any food sensitivities you have. When you experience any
symptoms, go back to your food journal and see what foods
you’ve eaten just before the symptoms started. You should
also track foods down as far back as 24 to 48 hours — some-
times maybe even longer. Over time, you can detect a pattern.
 Help you pay attention to yourself. It may even be the first
time in your adult life that you’ve taken the time to do so. As
you continue to write in your journal, you’ll begin to discover
your own needs and rhythms. You may be so accustomed to
taking your cues from others outside of yourself — your par-
ents, your peers, television commercials — that perhaps
you’ve forgotten how to listen to your own body.
Don’t worry if you forget to write things down, or if you don’t know
how to explain your feelings. Gradually, you’ll become adept at rec-
ognizing your feelings. It’s important to accept whatever you’re
feeling without blaming or criticizing yourself.
A food journal isn’t just for food
Write down any physical or emotional changes you may be experi-
encing. For instance, if you have more energy or you’re unusually
irritable, be sure to note it. Instead of jotting down your feelings
only after you eat, make a point of writing them down every hour
or two. Recording your feelings can make it easier to see how
Chapter 6: Gorging on Good Health 109

certain foods (or combinations of foods) affect your mood or phys-
ical symptoms. You don’t have to write lengthy essays — just a
word or two will suffice.
When you write what you’re feeling on a regular basis, you may
begin to uncover
 Connections between foods that you never suspected before
 Whether a recurrent feeling is triggered by something you eat
or by the stresses in your life
 What’s working or not working in terms of your diet
 Where and how you drifted from your eating program (if you
did drift; what are you, superhuman?)
The more you know about what’s going on with yourself, the easier
it is to make any necessary adjustments in your life. Highlight your
journal, and circle any links you see. Have fun while becoming your
own private investigator.
Tracking your progress
Look over your journal every week. If you can, look it over on the
same day of the week (Sunday, for example) so that you don’t
forget. After you start identifying the patterns and feeling more
confident about your food choices (perhaps in a month or two),
you can review every two weeks. But if you notice anything
unusual (like the appearance of certain symptoms), don’t wait
to refer to your journal.
If keeping a food journal seems too overwhelming for you right
now, don’t get discouraged. When you have chronic low blood
sugar, getting focused or motivated is hard. Just do the best you
can. It all starts coming together when you start feeling better.
Until then, try jotting any unusual symptoms or anything else of
note on your calendar. At the end of the day, give a numerical
rating to the day. This method may give you the momentum and
motivation to try the more complete version of the food diary.
Keeping a daily food journal helps you make refinements and get
better results. On the other hand, avoid straying too far from the
basic recommendations. You’ll know when you aren’t following
your diet correctly, because your hypoglycemic symptoms (see
Chapter 3 if you need a refresher on symptoms) will reappear.
Don’t sweat it if they do; just get right back to following your
healthy eating plan.

S
hould you take vitamin and mineral supplements? The next
time you’re bored in a meeting, bring up this question. Add to
the discussion a disorder that some people argue doesn’t even
exist, and there you have a fine debate.
Although dietary therapy is the cornerstone of hypoglycemia treat-
ment, anyone suffering from blood sugar imbalance has an
increased need for many nutrients that aren’t easy to obtain only
from food. Nutritional supplements handle many symptoms as well
as help improve blood sugar control.
This chapter shows you how to use herbs, vitamins, and minerals
to address specific hypoglycemic symptoms and discomforts.
Chapters 8, 9, and 10 show you additional ways you can cope and
survive — even thrive — with this metabolic disorder.
Getting Acquainted with Herb
When you get to know “Herb,” you find that he’s a pretty interest-
ing fellow. He’s been around for a long time, all over the world. Yes,
herbs have probably been used since the dawn of humankind, and
herbal medicine is no passing fad. Traditionally, people in Europe,
India, and China have relied on herbal medicine to prevent and
heal illnesses.

Humans treat a variety of complaints — from insomnia to
allergies — with herbal remedies. In some cases, herbs (roots,
flowers, and other parts of plants with medicinal properties)
can be just as (or more) effective in treating common ailments as
prescription and over-the-counter medications; they’re generally
safer, too.
This effectiveness in treating ailments doesn’t mean, however, that
herbs are completely safe. Being natural doesn’t mean that some-
thing is completely without side effects — some substances can be
“naturally poisonous,” after all. Also, before combining herbal
treatments with prescription medications, check with your physi-
cian and an experienced herbal practitioner.
As long as you use herbs as instructed and take them in the right
doses, they have a good safety record. Some herbalists warn that
certain herbs or formulas taken for a long time can lead to toxicity.
So don’t continue to take something for longer than you need it,
and take breaks from the products. Keep in mind that these are
just general guidelines; everyone reacts to herbs differently. What
works for your Aunt Ninny may not work for you.
Saying Hello to Supplements
and Vitamins
Not only did Mom tell you to eat your veggies, but she also made
you down those nasty-tasting vitamins. Who knew she was right?
And do you know what supplements really are? They’re nutrients,
such as vitamins and minerals, that you add to your regular diet in
the form of pills, powders, or liquids. This section takes a closer
look at what vitamins, minerals, and supplements are and their
roles in a balanced diet.
Vitamins and minerals
Vitamins, which are vital to the regulation of metabolic processes
(chemical changes in living cells by which energy is provided) are
generally classified as being one of the following:
 Water soluble: These aren’t stored in the body. Any excess
gets flushed into the urine — for this reason, some doctors
insist that all you get from taking vitamins is expensive urine.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
112

 Fat soluble: This type is stored in the body, so be careful not to
take too much. These vitamins can build up to a toxic level. The
fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and K. Some doctors discourage
supplementation, because they’re afraid that people will be
careless and take too much. This isn’t usually a problem, unless
you’re taking megadoses for an extended period of time.
The American Medical Association and the National Academy of
Sciences continue to maintain their official stance by saying that
supplementation has no benefits as long as you’re eating a proper,
well-balanced diet. Yet a large and growing body of evidence sug-
gests that you can gain significant health benefits from taking vita-
mins. Many medical doctors are beginning to recognize that
vitamins and minerals, often in amounts that are difficult to get
through food alone, can alleviate certain conditions.
If you take a daily vitamin, we recommend giving your body a
break from the vitamin pill, because your body can become habitu-
ated to it, decreasing its effectiveness. By stopping from time to
time, you’ll still enjoy the benefits of supplementation while reduc-
ing the costs. Take vitamins for one month straight and then go off
them for a week. Or you can take them for six days and break for
one day. For more information on vitamins, see Vitamins For
Dummies, by Christopher Hobbs, LAc, and Elson Haas, MD (Wiley).
Supplements
Nutritional supplements are vitamins in the form of tablets, cap-
sules, powders, or liquids, and they can be natural or synthetic.
Natural vitamins are derived from natural sources — from plant or
animal tissues — while synthetic vitamins are created artificially to
assume the same chemical structure as the natural vitamin.
Choose natural vitamins whenever you can, because they may con-
tain substances that scientists aren’t necessarily aware of yet that
may provide extra benefits. Besides, the substances found in natural
vitamins remain in their natural ratio, which works better. Synthetic
vitamins may also have added artificial colorings and flavorings that
you’re better off without. Always read the labels to make sure that
your vitamins contain no added sugar, yeast, or preservatives. The
label tells you whether the vitamin is natural or synthetic.
Never let taking supplements be an excuse for eating poorly. Aim
to get as many nutrients as possible from actual foods.
Chapter 7: Hanging with Herb and His Buddies 113

Taking the Hypoglycemia Mix
Table 7-1 shows the basic list of daily vitamins that nutritionists
and practitioners have found to be beneficial to people suffering
from hypoglycemia. Please note that the dosages listed in the table
are meant only as general guidelines. The recommended dosage
levels vary with a patient’s age, activity level, and current nutri-
tional status. You can easily get the recommended levels by taking
a good multiple vitamin and mineral formula (for resources on
where to buy them, see the sidebar, “Jumping on the Net for more
alternatives”) and then adding specific nutrients that may be miss-
ing or that aren’t provided in high enough amounts. (Note:
Multiple vitamin and mineral formulas sold at supermarkets and
drug stores are generally not the best kind.)
Although they’re higher than the Recommended Daily Allowance
(RDA), the following dosages aren’t considered megadoses, and
taking them shouldn’t result in any unwanted side effects.
However, consult your primary care physician before you begin.
All the ingredients in supplements should appear on the label. The
amounts in Table 7-1 are given in milligrams (mg), micrograms
(mcg), and international units (IU). These measurements are differ-
ent ways of expressing the amount of vitamins and minerals in a
tablet or capsule. A milligram is 1⁄1000 of a gram, while a microgram is
1⁄1000 of a milligram. IU is an international standard of measurement
for vitamins A, D, and E. There’s no fixed definition for IU; it’s differ-
ent for each substance.

taking 1,500 mg of calcium a day, you can take 500 mg in the morn-
ing, 500 at noon, and 500 in the evening. Take these vitamins in
divided doses for better overall absorption:
 Calcium
 Magnesium
 Vitamin C
 Thiamin

in Table 7-2. They’re particularly helpful because they support glu-
cose and insulin metabolism, facilitate glands involved in blood-
sugar regulation, raise blood sugar levels, and/or enhance mood.

then you’re going to have to be more stringent and careful with
your diet. Put all your available resources for healing into high-
quality foods. (Flip to Chapter 6 for complete instructions.)
Perhaps you’re in a tight spot financially because of your battle
with hypoglycemia. After you stabilize your blood sugar, you may
find your entire life — including your finances — changing for the
better. Begin taking all the recommended vitamins and supple-
ments then, when you have the financial means to do so without
breaking the bank.

If you do have any extras leftover for spending, get the following
supplements, because they’re likely to have the most direct impact
on stabilizing blood sugar and keeping your symptoms at bay:
 Chromium (GTF): Take a minimum of 200–500 micrograms in
the form of chromium picolinate per day. Some nutritionists
recommend at least 600 mcg daily or even as much as 1,000
mcg daily. If you find yourself frequently craving sugar, you
may have a low level of chromium in your body.
 The amino acid 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP): It’s said to be
effective for carbohydrate cravings. Take 50–100 mg three
times a day. 5-HTP is also the direct precursor to serotonin,
the neurotransmitter that plays a critical role in the regulation
of mood. It can be helpful for some people in the treatment of
depression. 5-HTP loses its effectiveness if taken continuously,
so refrain from taking it for one to two days each week.
 Omega-3 essential fatty acid: Take a minimum of 3,000 mg
daily, in the form of fish oil liquid or capsules. Omega-3s are
essential, but the body can’t make them — you must get them
through food. Unfortunately, the modern diet is woefully defi-
cient in Omega-3. Getting a supplement is important for
people with blood sugar problems because the amount of
Omega-3 you get is directly related to how sensitive the cells
are to insulin, the key hormone in balancing blood sugar.
Studies suggest that Omega-3 supplementation may help with
depression, aggression, eczema, attention deficit disorder
(ADD), and blood pressure.
Some nutritionists recommend that patients who want to
improve their carbohydrate metabolism should initially satu-
rate their system by taking a total of 6,000 mg Omega-3 daily.
Make sure that any product you’re taking is pure and
processed properly. For example, mercury and lead are
common contaminants in fish oil. If your product is tainted,
the supplement will damage rather than improve your health.
Matching Supplements to Ails:
Which Makes You Feel Better?
This section gets to the fun part: symptoms! Fortunately, you can
summon stalwart supporters to your aid. We list some of the most
common symptoms of hypoglycemia and things you can take to
alleviate them.
Chapter 7: Hanging with Herb and His Buddies 119

You’re not going to have all the symptoms listed in the following
sections, and even though the symptoms are associated with hypo-
glycemia, having one or more of them and not having the disorder
is possible. If you want to know more about the symptoms of hypo-
glycemia, flip to Chapter 3.
See your primary care physician before starting a supplemental
program. In addition, when you consult with any healthcare practi-
tioner, always let her know exactly what supplements you’re taking.
Anxiety
Are you anxious about everything? Are you just plain anxious
about nothing in particular? People are more prone to feeling
aches and pains when they’re suffering from anxiety.
Some supplements are good for helping control anxiety. They can
be too stimulating, making it hard for you to sleep, so be careful
not to take the following supplements at night:
 GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid): You can find this amino
acid and neurotransmitter in capsule form. Take the recom-
mended dosage described on the product.
 Inositol: This vitamin-like substance is often grouped with the
B vitamins. A study showed that its effects are similar to those
of mild tranquilizers. Therapeutic doses (amounts high enough
to have a medicinal effect on the person taking it) of inositol
range from 500–1,000 mg per day. In some sensitive individ-
uals, too high a dose can cause diarrhea.
 Kava kava: This herb can help you relax but remain alert.
Kava kava contains active ingredients that are thought to
work like aspirin. Look for it in tinctures (highly concentrated
liquid herbal extracts) and capsules at herbal shops.
Some studies have linked it with severe liver damage.
Although such cases are rare, the potential risk exists. Take
the herb only under the guidance of a qualified healthcare
practitioner. Furthermore, pregnant or nursing women are
strongly advised against taking it. Also, be aware that if you
take alcohol or barbiturates, kava kava will have a stronger
effect on you.
 Passionflower: This herb is especially effective if you have
anxiety attacks in the middle of the night. You can brew pas-
sionflower into a tea (steep two teaspoons of the dried herb
for 30 minutes in a cup of freshly boiled water), or you can
consume it in a tincture. Don’t use it for more than two weeks.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
120

 Skullcap: This herb, which contains minerals such as calcium,
iron, potassium, and magnesium, revitalizes the nervous
system. It eases stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as
alleviates premenstrual syndrome. Use as an extract.
 Vitamin B: Make sure that you’re getting enough of this vita-
min. Studies on both humans and animals suggest an associa-
tion between anxiety and deficiencies of vitamin B complex.
Take 25–100 mg of vitamin B complex a day, as a single dose
or in divided doses (the required dose split into two or three
doses).
If you have recurrent, long-standing anxiety problems that aren’t
caused by medical conditions, you should definitely make medita-
tion, deep breathing, and relaxation exercises a part of your daily
life. (Chapter 9 can help.) Because anxiety and depression often go
hand in hand, you may want to refer to the sections
“Depression/mood swings” and “Stress,” later in this chapter.
Asthma
People who suffer from asthma have labored breathing often
accompanied by wheezing, coughing, or gasping. They may experi-
ence a sense of constriction in the chest.
The following supplements can help reduce the severity of asthma
attacks; you shouldn’t, however, under any circumstances, substi-
tute these remedies for what your doctor prescribes you. In case of
a serious attack, call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
 Fish oil capsules: The oil should be from fish high in anti-
inflammatory Omega-3 fatty acids (salmon, mackerel, sar-
dines, and tuna). You have to take these capsules for ten
weeks or so before you start noticing benefits.
Avoid fish oils if you’re allergic to fish.
 Garlic: Garlic works as a mucus regulator for chronic bronchi-
tis. Garlic cooked with chicken soup is especially nourishing.
Inhaling the fumes while the soup is cooking can help alleviate
symptoms. Sip the soup throughout the day.
 Nettle: Nettle (in the form of root juice or leaves) can help
relieve asthma symptoms and allergies. Some very potent
ginger extracts naturally reduce inflammation throughout
the body.
 Turmeric: This Indian spice is a good anti-inflammatory. The
whole spice, however, isn’t potent enough. Instead, get cap-
sules with curcumin, and take at least 400 mg daily.
Chapter 7: Hanging with Herb and His Buddies 121

Chronic fatigue syndrome
If you have hypoglycemia associated with chronic fatigue syn-
drome, the following supplements may provide some relief:
 Ashwaganda root: It energizes by nourishing the kidneys.
 Astragalus: It strengthens the immune system by helping the
body produce antibodies and working in the bone marrow to
produce white blood cells.
 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): DHEA improves neurologi-
cal function, immune function, and stress disorders. Women
shouldn’t exceed 15mg per day, and men shouldn’t exceed
25mg per day, unless blood levels are monitored by a physi-
cian or other health professional.
 Echinacea: Good for fighting colds, flu, and infections, echi-
nacea boosts the immune system.
 Ginkgo biloba: It improves circulation, sharpens memory,
reduces anxiety, and boosts concentration.
 Hydrocortisone: Used in the treatment of chronically
stressed and weakened adrenals.
 Licorice: No, not the candy! Don’t take this supplement if you
have high blood pressure. Licorice has anti-inflammatory,
anti-allergic, and anti-arthritic properties.
 NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide): It’s found in all
living cells, and it’s essential for their development and energy
production. Helps fight fatigue.
 SAM-e (S-adenosyl-methionine): It’s an amino acid derivative
that’s normally synthesized in the body. Some evidence
suggests that it may be a fast-acting, safe, and effective
antidepressant.
 Siberian ginseng: Useful in fighting stress and fatigue,
Siberian ginseng protects the liver and helps prevent memory
loss and boosts energy.
Constipation
Who hasn’t suffered from constipation at one time or another?
Thanks to the modern diet, it’s become a common problem in the
so-called civilized world. Just staying away from sugar and refined
flour should soon relieve (indeed!) your problem. The following
remedies may help relieve constipation:
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
122

 Allicin: This substance found in garlic stimulates the contrac-
tions of the intestinal walls. Eating garlic by itself can upset
your stomach, so you may want to stir-fry it with onions or
mix it with yogurt to help buffer it.
 Radishes: Yes, that reddish root vegetable can help alleviate
constipation, too. Radishes in yogurt may be interesting, but
they’ll probably taste better in a salad.
 Whole grain barley: Try eating whole grain barley products
(the less processed, the better).
If you have chronic problems with constipation, or if you haven’t
produced a BM for a week or longer, see your doctor.
Depression/mood swings
After you stabilize your blood sugar, your depression should begin
to ease (unless underlying problems exist). If you’re hypoglycemic,
make sure that you follow the recommended dietary changes in
this book or the changes outlined by your healthcare practitioner.
That alone should make a significant difference. At any rate, with
all the pharmaceutical, vitamin, and herbal aids out there, not to
mention psychotherapy and counseling, no one should continue to
suffer the debilitating effects of depression.
People with clinical depression should seek professional help
immediately. If you’ve been feeling blue for more than a couple
weeks, get help. (See Chapter 10 for more info.)
Here are some supplements that can help elevate your mood and
even out your highs and lows:
 Acetyl L-tyrosine: Positive effects have been noted with acetyl
L-tyrosine. Take 1,000–2,000 mg daily on an empty stomach.
Take higher doses only under doctor supervision, because
they can raise your blood pressure or lead to rapid pulse.
Do not take acetyl L-tyrosine with MAO inhibitor drugs, or if
you tend to suffer from migraines. (Some MAO inhibitors
include Bupropion, Harmaline, and Nardil.)
 Black cohosh: This helper reduces mood swings, anxiety, and
depression, and hot flashes in postmenopausal women.
 Damiana: This medicinal plant is also supposed to be good
for depression and anxiety. Take it three times a day as an
infusion (herbal tea) or tincture.
 Dandelion tea: If you think suppressed anger is causing your
depression, sip dandelion tea.
Chapter 7: Hanging with Herb and His Buddies 123

 Folic acid: People with a dietary deficiency of folic acid, part
of the B vitamin complex, exhibit depressed mood, lethargy,
poor concentration, and irritability. But studies suggest that
taking folic acid supplements can help even if people aren’t
deficient. It seems to aid the response to antidepressant
drugs, even in people who were previously unresponsive to
medication. For some people, folic acid by itself may be
enough to relieve depression. Take 500 mcg daily.
 L-tryptophan: Leading health experts highly recommend this
amino acid. It helps the body increase its production of sero-
tonin, the feel-good neurotransmitter that’s often low in
depressed people. Blood levels of tryptophan are also usually
low in depressed people.
Take 2–4 grams of L-tryptophan daily. Take it before bedtime
on an empty stomach. It works best if you also take niaci-
namide. Do not take tryptophan if you have asthma, because
it can make your breathing problems worse.
 NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide): This coenzyme
(active form of an enzyme system) plays a pivotal role in the
body’s energy production and can be safely combined with
SAM-e. Start with 2.5 mg daily and increase your dosage by 2.5
mg each week until you find the right dose for you.
Don’t take NADH too late in the day, because it can overstimu-
late you and prevent you from sleeping. Take it first thing in
the morning on an empty stomach.
 SAM-e (S-adenosyl-methionine): Some evidence suggests that
SAM-e (pronounced “Sammy”) may be a fast-acting, safe, and
effective antidepressant. It’s an amino acid derivative that’s
normally synthesized in the body. It starts working in a week
or two (sometimes in just a few days), compared to two to six
weeks for prescription medication. Unlike medication, SAM-e
doesn’t come with a laundry list of side effects.
Start by taking one 200 mg tablet in the morning on an empty
stomach. (Take it with food if it upsets your stomach; it won’t
work quite as effectively with food, so you may need to take a
larger dose.) You can gradually increase the dosage up to 1,600
mg, depending on your needs. Generally, 400 mg seems to
work. Be sure that the tablets are enteric-coated; if they aren’t,
your body won’t absorb them properly. (Because the special
coating can withstand stomach acid, enteric-coated tablets dis-
solve in the small intestine for maximum absorption.) Studies
have shown that taking folic acid, B12, and B6 gives you even
better protection against depression. Don’t take SAM-e too late
in the day, because it may interfere with your sleep.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
124

 Selenium: This supplement is an essential mineral that should
be taken with vitamin E. Selenium makes vitamin E work
better, and medical trials have shown that it improves mood.
 St. John’s Wort: This supplement, which was widely used in
Europe before gaining popularity in the United States, has
received a lot of media play for its antidepressant effects. It’s
good for mild to moderate depression. You need to take it for
four to six weeks or longer before starting to see any beneficial
results. Make sure that you take capsules standardized to 0.3
percent hyperium. St. John’s Wort may cause sun sensitivity.
 Vitamin E: This supplement can reduce mood swings. Make
sure that you take the natural form, d-alpha (d’l-alpha is the
synthetic form). The recommended dosage ranges from
400–1,600 IU daily. If you’re diabetic or you have bleeding
problems, you should talk to your physician before taking
vitamin E in dosages more than 100 IU.
 5-HTP: This supplement may also be helpful in treating
depression. Take 100 mg daily, or as recommended by your
healthcare practitioner. See “Taking the Hypoglycemia Mix,”
earlier in this chapter for more information.
Digestive problems
You started eating the right foods, but your GI tract is throwing fits
anyway. What can you do? Check out the following sections for
some help.
Stomach
Eating the wrong foods, as well as eating them in far too large a
quantity, causes many digestive problems. As you eat less of the
foods that made you sick in the first place and turn to the recom-
mended hypoglycemic diet (see Chapter 6), your digestive system
will stop getting so overburdened.
Until this change in diet helps your condition improve, you can take
licorice capsules before meals. (Don’t confuse this supplement with
licorice candy, which does you no good!) Taking two or three cap-
sules about a half an hour before meals can prevent heartburn.
Digestive enzyme supplements can also help digestive problems.
Choose enzyme capsules that include the following:
 Amylase: To help break down carbohydrates
 Cellulose: To digest fruits and vegetables
Chapter 7: Hanging with Herb and His Buddies 125

 Lactase: To digest milk
 Lipase: To break down fat
 Protease: To metabolize complex proteins
Eating a lot of cooked and processed foods can deplete your
supply of natural digestive enzymes. This depletion may not
matter so much when you’re younger, but as you age and your
supply of natural digestive enzymes diminishes, you’ll find your
system unable to properly digest foods or absorb nutrients. You’re
more apt then to suffer from the hallmarks of low blood sugar,
such as decreased energy, headaches, and fatigue.
Liver
When considering digestion, you may have overlooked one organ:
the liver. It’s an underappreciated organ that slaves away each day,
detoxifying your blood and ridding your body of poisonous sub-
stances. It’s responsible for more than 500 functions. Secreting bile
to aid in fat digestion is just one of these many functions.
When you have indigestion, your stomach isn’t necessarily upset:
It’s often your liver. Well, you’d be upset, too, if no one ever
thanked you for the all the work you do!
The least you can do is to give your liver some assistance. Here are
some supplements to help:
 Artichoke plant: It isn’t exactly an herb, but it’s good for
improving digestion and liver function. The part that’s benefi-
cial is the large basal leaf (everything but the heart). Clinical
studies show that the basal leaves are good for digestion and
liver function — what the studies neglect to mention is that
they’re also really delicious! Of course, it may be hard to eat
an artichoke every day, even if you like them.
A convenient way to enjoy the benefits of artichokes is to take
an artichoke extract. (Black radish juice extract also encour-
ages the liver to produce bile.) You can take 300–600 mg of
standardized artichoke extract before, during, or after a meal.
If you eat six small meals a day, though, you don’t need to
take the extract at each meal. Just take the extract whenever
you need to, such as when you end up eating more than you
want to. You should refrain from taking artichoke extract if
you have gallstones or an obstruction of the bile duct.
 Barberry: Bitter compounds in barberry stimulate digestive
function. It can also help fight infections and stomach
problems.
 Dandelion: This herb aids digestion.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
126

 Elderflower: This herb assists with digestion. It’s also good
for coughs, sore throats, fever, and hay fever.
 Gentian: This herb increases the numerous secretions along
the entire digestive tract and helps get digestion back on track.
 Milk thistle: This herb has an active ingredient that’s one of
the strongest known liver protectors. It prevents toxins from
damaging liver cells and speeds the healing of liver damage.
 Peppermint: Herbs in the mint family are excellent for diges-
tion. Peppermint stimulates bile flow and the secretion of
digestive juices.
 Turmeric: This bitter herb forms the base of most Indian cur-
ries. It’s good for digestion, it helps build the blood, and it
eases menstruation. It contains ingredients that are anti-
inflammatory, antioxidant, and liver-protective.
Fatigue and energy drain
Everyone, especially people who have low blood sugar, experi-
ences fatigue. A general feeling of fatigue isn’t the same thing as
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). A diagnosis is critical but, gener-
ally speaking, you may have CFS if you have severe, unexplained
fatigue that’s not relieved by rest and that lasts for at least six or
more consecutive months. (For more on CFS, see Chapter 3. For
supplements that can help relieve the symptoms of CFS, see
“Chronic fatigue syndrome,” earlier in this chapter.)
For run-of-the-mill tiredness, you can try the following supplements:
 Acetyl L-tyrosine: This supplement is an amino acid. Take
1,000–2,000 mg daily.
Don’t take acetyl L-tyrosine if you’re taking MAO inhibitor
drugs or if you tend to suffer from migraines.
 Lemon balm: This herb calms, soothes, and revives energy.
 Mint: Herbs in the mint family can help revive energy.
 Oatstraw: This herb is a tonic that can relieve both physical
and emotional fatigue. It’s a good supplement to take when
you’re feeling frazzled and exhausted.
 NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide): This supplement
is known as the “energizing coenzyme.” It plays a crucial role
in producing energy. With regular supplementation, you can
expect to enjoy more energy and improved athletic perform-
ance. (See “Depression/mood swings,” earlier in this chapter.)
Chapter 7: Hanging with Herb and His Buddies 127

 Potassium: This supplement is known to enhance energy and
vitality. Take potassium aspartate with magnesium aspartate.
 Siberian ginseng: It can boost your energy but may be too
strong if you have a weak constitution. You may have to take
Siberian ginseng for several weeks before you feel an appre-
ciable difference. When you take it, avoid caffeine and other
stimulants.
 Stinging nettle: This herb is good for anemia, because it con-
tains iron. It can also help with midafternoon slumps.
If you suffer from fatigue, be sure to rule out any possible medical
causes. People with hypoglycemia sometimes have thyroid prob-
lems, so get your thyroid checked before trying the more potent
herbs, such as Siberian ginseng.
Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia is estimated to afflict between 6 and 12 million people
in the United States. It’s a painful, debilitating syndrome that
affects mostly women and bears a striking resemblance to chronic
fatigue syndrome. Some people with hypoglycemia may also suffer
from fibromyalgia. (Flip to Chapter 3 for more info.) For more on
fibromyalgia, check out Fibromyalgia For Dummies, by Roland
Staud, MD, and Christine Adamec (Wiley).
Intravenous vitamin and mineral injections may produce a signifi-
cant improvement in the symptoms of fibromyalgia. For this type
of treatment, consult a knowledgeable physician. The periodic use
of UltraClear or UltraInflam detox programs, which are available
through physicians, have also been known to help relieve the
symptoms of fibromyalgia.
SAM-e, which is an anti-inflammatory that helps relieve muscular
pain, and NADH (see “Depression/mood swings,” earlier in this
chapter) are also beneficial for treating the symptoms of fibromyal-
gia. If your condition is severe, you may want to try a gram dosage
of SAM-e daily.
Headaches
Hypoglycemics often experience various types of headaches, rang-
ing from mild to severe, in one or various parts of the head.
Migraines are one kind of headache that can sometimes be trig-
gered by a bout of low blood sugar. If you get headaches halfway
between meals, they may be the result of having too much insulin
in your bloodstream — which then leads to hypoglycemia.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
128

You may be able to alleviate your headaches with the following
remedies:
 Feverfew: This popular garden herb with its anti-inflamma-
tory properties is beneficial for both arthritis and migraine
headaches. Feverfew may help keep blood vessels from con-
stricting, which can stop a throbbing headache.
Feverfew stimulates the uterus, so don’t use it during
pregnancy.
 Fish oil capsules: These are beneficial for the prevention of
headaches. Unless you’re allergic to fish, you should eat more
cold-water fish, such as salmon, mackerel, and trout.
If you’re pregnant, avoid fish unless otherwise instructed by
your doctor.
 Ginger: Ginger prevents the release of substances that make
blood vessels dilate. Keeping blood flow even can help pre-
vent and relieve migraines. Use fresh or powdered ginger
when you cook. You can also grate fresh ginger into juice.
 Mullein: This herb eases many kinds of lung ailments and
strengthens the respiratory tract.
If correcting your blood sugar imbalance doesn’t help relieve your
headaches or if you have recurrent and/or severe headaches, get
an appointment with your doctor.
Insomnia
Everyone needs some good, restful Zs. If you don’t get them, you’re
bound to be listless, unfocused, and crabby. Inadequate or poor-
quality sleep counts as insomnia, an underdiagnosed and under-
treated sleep ailment. Insomnia can be a short-term (a single night
to a few weeks), intermittent (episodes occur from time to time),
or chronic (occurs most nights and lasts months or more) condi-
tion. If you suffer from insomnia, it may be caused by a serious ill-
ness, so don’t wait to go to your friendly doctor.
If your insomnia isn’t caused by an underlying illness, or if it’s one
of the symptoms of your hypoglycemia (and you should get a
proper diagnosis for that, too), here are some things that can help:
 Calcium: Take it along with magnesium at night (in a ratio of 2
to 1). Take anywhere from 150–800 mg of calcium per day.
Don’t rely on milk alone, because it won’t provide you with
the correct amount of calcium.
Chapter 7: Hanging with Herb and His Buddies 129

 Inositol: A relative of the B-complex family, inositol has a
calming effect and encourages sound sleep. For temporary
insomnia, take 500–1,500 mg at bedtime. (Don’t take any other
B-complex vitamins at bedtime because they may keep you
awake.)
 Kava kava: This herb is helpful for preventing insomnia.
Pregnant women should avoid kava kava, as should anyone
with a liver condition.
 Lettuce juice: Some people find that drinking this juice helps
them sleep better.
 Niacin (B3): This vitamin may be helpful if you fall asleep
easily but can’t go back to sleep after waking up in the middle
of the night. Take 25–100 mg a day. You may experience a
niacin flush (where you feel overheated and your face begins
to redden) in the first few minutes after taking it. If you notice
these flush symptoms, decrease your dosage or take no-flush
niacin, which doesn’t cause flushing.
 Valerian: Another herb that helps prevent insomnia. One
study suggests that valerian root improved sleep for 80 per-
cent of people with sleep problems.
Low sex drive
If you suffer from low blood sugar, you’re also likely to experience
low energy, which in turn leads to low sex drive. It’s certainly not
an uncommon symptom among hypoglycemics. Try the following:
 Damiana: This is reputed to amp up sexual interest for
women when they sip it before bed. (But why restrict it to
bedtime?) It’s also supposed to alleviate depression and anxi-
ety, two conditions that can dampen your sexual appetite.
Take damiana three times a day as an infusion or a tincture.
 Garlic: Garlic breath may not exactly be an aphrodisiac, but
eating garlic stimulates the hormone glands, which, in turn,
revs up your sexual powers. Are you interested in finding out
more? Garlic stimulates the central nerve of the penis and
helps cause an erection. Garlic also nourishes and strengthens
your entire body, giving you the stamina to romp a little longer
in the hay.
The health-conscious Chinese use a lot of garlic in their cook-
ing. (Come to think of it, maybe that’s why they have a prob-
lem with overpopulation!) The Koreans eat a lot of garlic, too,
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
130

and a low birth rate isn’t one of their problems. Try garlic in
your cooking and take garlic capsules so that you can main-
tain a consistent intake.
 Nettle: A highly concentrated extract from the nettle root is
known to increase levels of free testosterone, which stimu-
lates sex cell receptor sites in the brain.
 Red clover: The extract of this plant contains phytoestrogens,
which can help maintain adequate estrogen levels in
menopausal women, which in turn may improve the libido.
The Chinese regard the kidneys as the fountain of energy, and the
kidneys and adrenal glands as the seat of sexuality. Anything that
balances and strengthens the kidneys is good. Take daily doses of
the following as tinctures to help your kidneys and adrenal glands:
 Angelica: This herb is also known as dong quai or dang quai,
and is used in the East as a good female tonic. It’s believed to
help improve women’s libido.
 Chasteberry: There’s nothing chaste about this herb. It nor-
malizes activity of the female sex hormones, and is especially
beneficial during menopause.
 Ginseng: Ginseng has been used to boost energy and alert-
ness in Asia for thousands of years. It contains compounds
that invigorate sex drive and improve sex response and sex
energy.
 Saw palmetto: It’s been shown to be as effective in reducing a
man’s prostate gland as the prescription medication Proscar.
Memory problems/poor concentration
Problems with cognitive function are one of the key symptoms of
hypoglycemia because the brain’s only source of fuel is glucose.
And when glucose levels are low — as in hypoglycemia — the
brain doesn’t work well. Without the necessary fuel, you’re bound
to have problems remembering anything or concentrating.
The following supplements can help improve your memory and
concentration:
 Choline: The brain needs this substance to produce a major
neurotransmitter.
 Gingko tablets: Gingko leaf extracts contain antioxidant prop-
erties. They also improve memory and alertness, and show
promise in treating Alzheimer’s disease.
Chapter 7: Hanging with Herb and His Buddies 131

 Gotu kola: Evidence indicates that gotu kola energizes the
brain and improves concentration. Herbalists sometimes call
this plant a vitamin for the brain.
 Pantothenic acid: Like choline, the brain needs it to facilitate
the transmission of impulses between neurons.
 Rosemary tea: It’s a handy-dandy way to perk you up anytime
you’re feeling dragged out. Drinking this tea is also a good
way to start out the morning. Come to think of it, it’s a
good way to end the day, too.
Midafternoon slump
Grabbing some coffee and a sweet roll to help get out of the after-
noon doldrums is all too easy. The caffeine and sugar duo — a
double whammy — may perk you up, and you may even think that
you’re more productive, but don’t kid yourself; you’re only setting
yourself up for a blood sugar crash to rival Black Monday’s stock
market crash. You’ll be blue, and you’ll be sorry, as you pay dearly
for the teensy bit of indulgence. It’s not worth it, especially when
you have so many healthy alternatives.
For instance, you may want to try
 Dandelion root tea: This herb balances blood sugar and helps
support liver function.
 Ginseng: This root is a good adrenal tonic that boosts energy.
It’s especially popular for increasing vitality and sexual
energy. It also improves functioning of the lungs and stomach.
 Gotu kola: This herb accelerates the healing process, boosts
memory, eases anxiety, increases energy, and protects against
stress.
 Grapefruit oil: This supplement acts as a brisk refresher. It
boosts memory and increases energy and mental ability. You
can get it in teas, tinctures, and capsules.
 Reishi: This red mushroom strengthens the immune system
and calms the nervous system. It can also help regulate blood
sugar. Doctors often prescribe it for general weakness and
fatigue.
 Stinging nettle: This popular mineral tonic is rich in vitamins
and minerals. It can help heal inflamed mucous membranes
caused by colds and coughs.
 Yerba mate: This South American herb is a great antioxidant
that elevates mood and alertness without giving you the jit-
ters. (But some people may object to the strong taste.)
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia

Nausea
Ginger works well for nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness,
and dizziness. It quells an upset stomach, reduces cholesterol, and
strengthens the heart’s overall functioning. For related conditions,
see “Digestive problems,” earlier in this chapter.
Poor circulation
Are you an ice princess or prince because of poor circulation?
Remember to exercise regularly, because exercise (more than any-
thing else) helps improve your circulation. Chapter 8 can get you
moving in the right direction. In addition, you may also want to try
the following:
 Cinnamon and cayenne pepper: Sprinkle ground cinnamon
and cayenne pepper into your socks and gloves (they should
preferably be made of cotton) to increase circulation and help
warm cold hands and feet.
Be careful not to get cayenne in your eyes! Wash your hands
thoroughly before touching yourself — or anyone else. If your
skin is sensitive, don’t touch the pepper with bare hands.
 Garlic: Eat more garlic. (So what doesn’t garlic do?) If you
can’t eat garlic for any reason, then take it in the form of garlic
pills, but get it into your system somehow.
 Ginger: Add ginger to your cooking, or grind it up and steep it
as tea. Ground ginger in bottles is okay for cooking and flavor-
ing, but it’s generally not potent enough for healing purposes.
 Warming foods: Eating warming foods, such as healthy soups,
may help your circulation. Drink your beverages at room tem-
perature or warmer. (Try to avoid iced beverages.) Refrain
from eating raw vegetables until your body becomes hotter —
when it’s stronger and circulation has improved. (Not every-
one agrees with this view. Raw foodists — people who con-
sume mostly raw foods — believe that raw vegetables can
help heat up people who appear to be constitutionally cold.)
In traditional Chinese medicine, people with a weak constitu-
tion who tend to suffer from cold hands and feet are told to
avoid eating raw vegetables because they have a cooling
effect on the body. Instead of eating cold salads, try quickly
steaming your salads — for only a minute or two, so as not to
destroy the nutrients. Rather than eat fruits or yogurts
straight from the fridge, leave them out for awhile so they’re
not ice-cold to the touch. (But don’t leave them out so long
that they become spoiled. Making sure that food doesn’t spoil
is especially important in the summer.)
Chapter 7: Hanging with Herb and His Buddies 133

Stress
When it comes to vitamins, supplements, and herbs, just about
anything that improves your overall health or strengthens the
functioning of any organ helps combat stress.
An anti-stress vitamin regimen should include the B-complex
vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, magnesium, calcium, potassium,
chromium, manganese, selenium, and iron. Specifically, keep the
following supplements in mind (and mouth):
 Astral: This herb is a good tonic. It supports the immune
system and helps the adrenal glands deal with stress.
 Ginseng: This famous herb helps you adapt to just about any
physiological stress. It helps restore equilibrium when your
body has been thrown out of whack by stressors. Siberian gin-
seng enhances overall physical endurance. Korean ginseng is
good, too, but its effects may be a little too potent.
 Mugwort: This herb, available in liquid or tea form, is often
prescribed for stress. You can take it as a tincture or place 
1⁄2 ounce of dried herb in half a cup of water.
Use caution if you have hay fever or are allergic to hazelnuts.
Avoid it if you’re pregnant or on blood thinners.
 Pantothenic acid: This vitamin is required for the adrenal
glands to work properly. If you’re very stressed, take more
than 700 mg daily in single or divided doses.
 Pyridoxine (vitamin B6): This vitamin helps with the synthe-
sis of the neurochemicals important for counteracting stress.
Take the same dosage of other B-complex vitamins.
Don’t take more than 100 mg, however, because excessive
doses can cause nerve damage.
 Reishi mushrooms: These mushrooms are an excellent tonic.
They give you a sense of overall well-being.
Refrain from taking too many of these mushrooms, especially
if you’re still young, because their effect is very strong. As
with anything, you need to find a good balance.
You may also want to consider the relaxing herbs, such as the pop-
ular chamomile, lavender, valerian, lemon balm, passionflower,
hops, and California poppy.
Part II: Diagnosing and Treating Your Hypoglycemia 
134

Water retention
You may experience water retention as a result of your hypo-
glycemia (or for a variety of other reasons).
If water retention is so severe that pressing on a swollen spot
leaves indentations on your skin, go see your doctor immediately.
Otherwise, you may want to try one of the following remedies to
help relieve your discomfort:
 Diuretic herbs:
• Corn silk tea is a safe and effective diuretic. But don’t sip
it at night, because it’ll make you go to the bathroom.
• Nettle and dandelion also have diuretic properties.
 Water: Drinking more water can help relieve water retention,
especially if you also cut back on sodium.
Taking a Whiff: Aromatherapy
Because the limbic system (which includes the brain’s hypothala-
mus, hippocampus, and amygdala; the limbic system is especially
concerned with emotion and motivation) processes odor and emo-
tions, smells evoke powerful and immediate reactions.
Aromatherapy, using essential oils for therapeutic purposes, is a
good addition in soothing hypoglycemia’s physical and emotional
effects, and smoothing your transition to a healthier lifestyle.
Essential oils are the aromatic and volatile liquids derived from
herbs or plants. Because essential oils are highly aromatic, you can
get many of their benefits by simply inhaling or diffusing them into
the room. Buy only pure, natural essential oils if you want the full
range of physical and psychological benefits of aromatherapy.
After you get used to handling the oils, they’re quite safe. But as
with anything, including prescription medicine, treat them with
precaution. Be aware of the following essential oil don’ts:
 Don’t take essential oils by mouth, because they can be quite
toxic. If you accidentally swallow an essential oil, call your
local poison control center (keep the number in a handy
place) or 911 immediately.
 Don’t get the oil in your eyes or on other sensitive body parts.
Chapter 7: Hanging with Herb and His Buddies 135

 Don’t let children or pets near essential oils.
 Don’t ever apply any of the essential oils directly to your skin
without first diluting them. The oils are very concentrated,
and they will irritate your skin.
 Don’t forget to consult a knowledgeable healthcare practi-
tioner before using any essential oils. If you suffer from seri-
ous or chronic illnesses, such as cancer, epilepsy, heart
disease, or asthma, be very careful about using essential oils;
their potency is nothing to sniff at.
If you have very sensitive skin or allergies, do a patch test before
using an essential oil. Dab a 2-percent solution of the essential oil
and water on a small patch of skin, such as the underside of your
arm. Over the next 12 hours, check for any redness or itching. If
you notice either, don’t use the oil on your skin. Even if you can’t
apply the diluted oil to your skin, you can still dab it on a tissue,
hankie, or cotton ball and inhale it as needed. You can also put a
few drops in your bath.
If you really want to get into aromatherapy heavy duty, several
books on the subject are available, including Aromatherapy For
Dummies, by Kathi Keville (Wiley). You can also find out more from
a reputable aromatherapist. Ask for referrals for trained, certified
aromatherapists from people you trust.
Rocking Bach’s Flower Remedies
This is true flower power! The theory behind flower remedies is
that the energy of flowers contained in flower essences (the extract
from flowers) treats emotional patterns that result in the manifes-
tation of physical symptoms. One of the most popular formulas,
Bach’s Rescue Remedy, is reputed to be quite effective for stress.
Some people even use flower essences for their pets.
Right now, virtually no scientific studies back up the claims of
flower-essence healing, mostly because the essences don’t lend
themselves readily to scientific research. So, although they’re fun
to try, be careful and controlled in your experiments, and know
that essential oils and flower essences can’t replace advice from a
doctor. When in doubt, always consult a healthcare practitioner.

because many of the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia
are caused by disruptions in the stress hormones.

E
nergy is probably the last thing you feel when your body and
brain cells aren’t properly fueled, right? What’s more, as a
hypoglycemic, you’ve probably been chronically undernourished,
so the weakness lingers. You must balance your blood sugar to
properly fuel your body.
However, before you run out, buy a new exercise wardrobe, and sign
up for a lifetime gym membership, take a deep breath. You need to
start small and gradually incorporate exercise into your lifestyle.
This chapter can help you relieve some of your hypoglycemia symp-
toms with aerobic activities, yoga and T’ai Chi, weightlifting, and
other forms of exercise. You can make your life a little more manage-
able. Before you start exercising, first read this chapter.
Why Exercise Is Important When
Battling Hypoglycemia
Unfortunately, you can’t balance your blood sugar and properly
fuel your body by using a quick fix; permanent lifestyle changes are
the only way to go. Changing your diet is the first step. Chapter 6
helps you do that. The next step is getting regular exercise.
Exercise goes hand in hand with diet changes, and it’s crucial for
improved health and well-being. Exercise helps you
 Battle depression. Depression is a major hypoglycemia symp-
tom that endorphins, which are released when you’re active,

can work to fight. Endorphins are feel-good hormones pro-
duced by the body. They’re nature’s own painkillers.
 Gain insulin sensitivity. Increased sensitivity results in lower
blood insulin levels. (Chapter 2 gives you details about how
hypoglycemia works.)
 Boost self-confidence. This boost includes better body image
and more control over other aspects of life.
 Achieve and maintain your ideal weight. This is another crit-
ical issue for a hypoglycemic. (Chapter 6 has more info.)
 Stick to a healthy diet. After you get into shape, your body
will desire good carbs, protein, fruits, and vegetables.
 Become stronger and healthier. When you’re strong and
healthy, you don’t need to be quite as compulsive about your
diet. You can eat more carbs, and you can even eat forbidden
foods on occasion without suffering undue consequences.
Understanding why exercise is important doesn’t mean you can go
out tomorrow morning and run three miles. Before you start any
exercise program, keep the following points in mind:
 Always see a doctor before participating in a fitness pro-
gram. (Chapter 4 gives you doc-picking info.)
 Pick an activity that you’re suited for and that appeals to
you. No matter what the activity is, pick something that you
enjoy doing because it can keep you more motivated. If you
pick something that you dread, chances are you won’t stick
with it when you get bored.
 Enjoy many activities. Do a variety of exercises to keep from
getting bored. As a matter of fact, a variety is good because
you work different parts of your body.
 If you already have an exercise routine but you’re not getting
the results you want, review it. Keeping track of your progress
in your food journal (Chapter 6) is a good way to start. Write
down the activity along with the intensity and duration.
If you never vary your routine, your body adapts, and you
stop making progress. To avoid this plateau, make small, con-
tinual changes.
If you’re completely out of shape or haven’t exercised for years,
don’t suddenly start a vigorous program of exercise. You’re likely
to hurt yourself. Check with your doctor before you start any pro-
gram. If you want more general knowledge and comprehensive
guidance on how to get fit, check out Fitness For Dummies, 3rd
Edition, by Susanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent (Wiley).

Easing Your Way into Exercise
What if you can’t stomach the thought of exercise? Even if exercise
doesn’t excite you, gradually adding just a bit of exercise to your
daily routine can help relieve your hypoglycemia symptoms and
help you feel better.
No matter what exercise you decide to do, one possible solution is
to combine it with something you enjoy. For instance, if you like to
zone out in front of the tube, why not exercise while you’re watch-
ing TV? It may keep you more alert and better conditioned than
you’ve ever been. To ease into exercise, you can begin by walking
in place, and then gradually add running in place. Just imagine,
you’ll be getting a good workout while enjoying your favorite show!
Needless to say, you don’t have to stick to TV — you can just as
easily do your workouts while listening to books, lectures, or semi-
nars on CDs or media content players.
Not sure how to start? This section helps you make that transition
to exercise by first modifying your behavior and then finding the
time to exercise regularly. In no time at all, you can begin to feel
better.
Modifying your behavior
One way to gradually condition yourself to exercise is through a
behavior modification technique that psychologists call approxi-
mation. For example, if your objective is to exercise by walking on
the treadmill, then start by simply getting on the treadmill and
standing on it for five minutes every day. To make the activity
more appealing, try reading the paper or a magazine, or sipping an
unsweetened beverage while standing on the treadmill. After that,
walk for two minutes. Gradually increase the time on the treadmill
every week until you’re walking for at least 20 minutes.
When walking in place, bringing your knees up higher increases
the aerobic intensity. To vary the routine, you can jump from side
to side, add a few jumping jacks, or skip with an imaginary rope.
You can also alternate walking with jumping or running in place.
Working up quite a sweat is possible just by doing these simple
exercises — without ever losing sight of your TV! After you get
used to this special “couch potato” exercise routine, your body will
become better toned. At that time you may discover that you’re
ready — perhaps even eager — to go outside for a walk or a jog, or
join an exercise class or two. An interesting phenomenon about fit-
ness is that when you become more physically fit, you actually
start craving exercise.
Chapter 8: Easing Symptoms and Energizing with Exercise 141

Finding the time to exercise
You work 40-plus hours a week. You have two kids (or grandkids) to
run to volleyball practice and piano lessons. You have household
chores to do. Are you wondering how anyone can fit in exercise?
The optimum amount of exercise for people suffering from chronic
ailments, such as hypoglycemia, is an hour a day, for a minimum of
five days a week. That may sound daunting, but even ultra-fast
workouts of five to ten minutes a day, a couple times a day, can be
a great start. These speed workouts can be highly effective. If you
haven’t exercised much in the past, these exercises will undoubt-
edly invigorate you.
If you’re already in shape, you can most likely jump to the next
level of fitness by either adding the ultra-fast exercises to your
basic workout routine or incorporating them as modifications to
the basic regimen. Focused, intensive training for brief amounts of
time can be more effective than an hour or more of halfheartedly
dragging out a workout. And doing something — anything — for
even five to ten minutes a day is better than doing nothing. But the
truth is that if you want to obtain optimum health and fitness, five
to ten minutes a day isn’t enough.
After you incorporate short bursts of exercise into your day, look
for ways to add longer periods of exercise into your daily routine.
If you’re busy, you probably don’t have large chunks of idle time.
The easy solution is to break up your workout sessions. Do ten-to-
fifteen-minute workouts several times a day. For instance, exercise
for ten minutes when you first get up to rev you up and get you
going. Work out once more in the mid-morning or before lunch, and
then again immediately after work (this helps you unwind after a
long day), and so forth. (You can do light stretching late at night
but refrain from vigorous exercise because that can hinder sleep.)
Studies have shown that you can get the same benefits and similar
conditioning with these shorter bursts of exercise as long as they
add up to at least half an hour (ideally an hour) a day.
Timing Your Carbs
The subject of carbohydrates is of vital importance to anyone
who’s struggling with erratic blood sugar levels. That’s because
carbs most directly affect the sugar in your blood. (For a complete
discussion on carbs and blood sugar, see Chapters 2 and 6.) The
short version? When you begin exercising, hormones are released
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
142

into the bloodstream signaling the liver and fat cells to liberate
their stored energy nutrients, primarily glucose. How much glyco-
gen (the sugar your body stores) you have in store depends partly
on the amount of carbs in your diet. When you exercise, your body
uses up a lot of glucose, which needs replenishing. You need to
know what to eat and when to eat it to prevent a blood sugar crash.
Studies have shown that eating carbs an hour before exercising
can extend endurance and improve performance. If you’re going to
take part in a strenuous form of exercise for more than 90 minutes,
such as mountain climbing, cross-country skiing, aerobics, or gym
workouts, your best bet is to eat a meal containing carbs about
one to two hours before the event. Doing so allows time for the
food to leave the stomach and reach the small intestine. You don’t
want to eat too close to your workout; otherwise, food will still be
in your stomach, and you may get nauseated.
On the other hand, if you eat about two hours or more before
your workout, most of the carbs will have already been burned
up. The trick, therefore, is to eat something that’s very slowly
digested and absorbed so that it remains in the intestine hours
after consumption.
Which carbs should you choose? Select foods with a GI (glycemic
index) of less than 55. (Check out www.glycemicindex.com for
more info on food with a low GI.) The body needs carbs as fuel, but
eating foods with a lower GI will spare you problems. After an
intense workout, however, a high GI food can help to restore the
glycogen in muscles in time for the next event. If you’re not a par-
ticularly athletic person, and you don’t regularly participate in
events, you don’t need to worry so much about replenishing your
glycogen store. If you’re famished after exercise, eat something
that quickly restores your blood sugar, and follow that with a
lower-GI carbohydrate and a little bit of protein.
Improving Insulin and Feeling
the Burn: Aerobics
Aerobic literally means with air. Aerobic activity increases your
body’s air intake, allowing you to burn more calories. Aerobic exer-
cise is any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your
lungs taking in more oxygen. Walking, bicycling, swimming, stair
climbing — and yes, sex — count as aerobic exercise. But don’t
rely exclusively on sex as a fitness regimen.
Chapter 8: Easing Symptoms and Energizing with Exercise 143

Most fitness experts agree that the best workout combines aerobic
activity with some form of weight training. (For more info on
weightlifting, check out “Kicking Weakness with Weights” later in
this chapter.) For most people, the optimal amount of exercise is
one hour per day, five to seven days per week. Exercising for
longer than a one-hour period may be counterproductive because
your body may begin to produce cortisol, a stress hormone. In
addition, exercising for too long, especially without fueling up, may
itself result in a bout of low blood sugar.
So do you want to start the burning? This section is a good place
to begin. You can read more about walking, running, jogging, and
even dancing.
Strut your stuff and work that walk
Walking is a simple and easy activity that just about anybody can
do, which makes it one of the best exercises for improving your
health. Walking makes the body more sensitive to the effects of
insulin and thus allows more glucose to be absorbed by the cells.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
144
Fun in the sun
Did you know that a growing body of research suggests that exposure to natural
light for one and a half to two hours a day may activate the adrenal glands and
thereby support adrenal function? Because the adrenals are involved with normal
blood sugar regulation, people with low blood sugar may do well to get some sun
every day.
A really good way to get some sunlight is to exercise outdoors. Not only is it invig-
orating, but it also helps your body acclimatize to the changing seasons better.
Better overall health can also translate into better blood sugar regulation. But you
need to watch out for bad air days and remember the following tips to stay safe:
 If there’s a pollution alert, don’t needlessly expose yourself.
 Don’t jog in the smog.
 Apply sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays and has an SPF rating of
at least 15.
 Don’t wear perfume in the sun, because some perfumes contain ingredients
that can cause burns or rashes when exposed to sunlight. Besides, the mix of
perfume and sweat isn’t the most alluring scent.
 Wear a helmet if you’re participating in an activity that requires one (such as
biking), especially if you’re prone to dizzy spells from attacks of low blood sugar.

Any exercise that improves insulin function is good for people who
have problems metabolizing glucose or regulating blood sugar.
Walking has been proven to help people reduce their cravings for
addictive substances, such as nicotine, alcohol, and barbiturates. If
you’re hypoglycemic, one of the worst things you can do is abuse a
substance like liquor or tobacco, but when you’re addicted, quit-
ting is hard to do. Use walking as your tool for fighting those crav-
ings and keeping your hypoglycemia under control.
Walking, an aerobic workout, is especially good for the blood-sugar
challenged, because walking is easy to start and maintain (even if
you’re suffering from fatigue), and it doesn’t have complex routines
to memorize (if you’re suffering from brain fog). If you’re out of
shape, or if you’ve been otherwise inactive for a long time, walking
may be the best way for you to begin exercising. After you exercise
with walking for a while, you can simply continue with it, comple-
ment it with other activities, or use it as a transitional activity for
other sports.
Here are some walking do’s:
 Before a walk that will last an hour or more, do eat a snack
with some protein and a complex carb. For example, eat a
half a slice of whole grain bread with nut butter or raw (or
lightly steamed) broccoli dipped in miso paste. These snacks
ensure that your blood sugar doesn’t drop mid-track.
 Do carry a snack and a water bottle with you.
Hypoglycemics should always carry food in the event that
your blood sugar dips too low. You should also avoid getting
dehydrated.
 Do use exercise walking, which combines arm and leg
movements. Fitness Walking For Dummies, by Liz Neporent
(Wiley), informs you of every aspect of walking.
 Do get the right shoes. Your shoes should be flexible, have
breathable fabrics, and provide good traction. Look for cush-
ioning at the tongue, around the collar, and at the heel. If you
walk fast, look for cushioning at the ball of the foot, also.
 If you tend to get dizzy or tire easily, do walk at night rather
than in the morning. In the morning your blood sugar is lower.
 Do get a weighted vest. They’re specially designed for walk-
ing, and you can get one that allows you to increase the weight
as you become better conditioned. The weights increase
resistance and help you burn more calories. Most people can
start out with low weights in the vest, but if you’re very much
out of shape, don’t wear a vest until you’re in better shape.
Chapter 8: Easing Symptoms and Energizing with Exercise 145

Now that you know what to do, check out these walking don’ts to
make sure you stay safe:
 Don’t walk while wearing ankle or wrist weights. You may
injure yourself from the added strain. (Weighted vests apply
the weight more evenly and are therefore less likely to cause
problems.)
 Don’t wear weights (vest or otherwise) that are more than
10 percent of your body weight. You may otherwise develop
back problems.
 Don’t forget to replace your walking shoes every 400 miles
(or when they start showing wear). Worn-out shoes don’t
provide enough support to protect your knees or lower back.
What’s the difference, you ask?
Running and jogging
Running and jogging (a slower version of running) are good exer-
cises, and they’re darn good ways to get your blood circulating and
burn up calories. However, if you have low blood pressure — as
many hypoglycemics do — and if bouts of low blood sugar have
left you wearier than not, it may be too much to suddenly start
running. A good workout combination is running and walking. For
instance, walk fast for 10 minutes, run for 1 minute, and then walk
at a normal pace for another 10 minutes.
For maximum aerobic benefit, jog for at least 20 minutes at your
target heart rate. The target rate shows you how fast your heart
should beat per minute when you exercise. To calculate your indi-
vidual heart rate:
1. Subtract your age from 226 if you’re a woman, and 220 if
you’re a man.
For example, say that you’re a 96-year-old man. Take
220–96 to get 124.
2. Multiply the result by .70.
This is your maximum target heart rate. In the example, take
the 124×.70 to get 86.8, your maximum target heart rate.
3. Multiply the result by .80.
This is your minimum target heart rate. To finish the exam-
ple, take your maximum heart rate (86.8) and multiply it by
.80 to get 69.44, your minimum target heart rate.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
146

Don’t worry if you can’t maintain your target heart rate for 20 min-
utes. Recent studies have shown that you can get similar benefits
with even 5-minute workouts interspersed at various times of the
day. And if you can’t get outside to run, run in place; the intensity
won’t be the same, but anything is better than sitting on your butt.
As with most exercises that involve your feet, shoes are an
extremely important part of running. The proper shoes ensure that
you get the most out of your workout and avoid injury. You can
read more about what to look for in shoes in this chapter’s previ-
ous section, and you can also buy your running shoes from a store
that specializes in runners’ needs. With this type of store, you can
use the knowledge of the experts to be sure that you’re buying the
best shoes for your feet.
Shaking your groove thang: Dancing
You don’t need to boogie all night to get the benefits of dance. This
fantastic activity can make you chipper, dapper, and slimmer —
and it can lift you right up from the doldrums of the low blood
sugar blues. And you’re not limited to any one kind of dance. You
can choose from all different types of dance: jazz, modern, hip-hop,
African, belly, and folk, to name just a few. You can do it solo, in a
pair, or as a group. (For a specific example of how to incorporate
dance into your life, check out the nearby sidebar, “Bust a move
with a dance program.”)
Chapter 8: Easing Symptoms and Energizing with Exercise 147
Bust a move with a dance program
If you’re tired of dancing to the same old beat, or if you’re just looking for something
different, consider trying a dance program, such as the Neuromuscular Integrative
Action (NIA) dance program.
NIA is adaptable to every age and body type, and for all levels of physical fitness.
Practitioners describe NIA as “fusion fitness” because NIA combines nonimpact
aerobics, dance, yoga-like movement, and some elements of martial arts. NIA lends
itself easily to solo or group dancing.
NIA’s adherents believe that regular participation can help improve blood circula-
tion, strengthen the immune system, and even alleviate emotional problems and
anxiety disorders. Of course, many other exercise and activity programs may pro-
vide similar benefits. What’s important is that you choose an activity that you enjoy
doing and that’s right for your fitness level.
Find out more by visiting NIA’s Web site at http://nia-nia.com. You can find
NIA classes worldwide through this site.

Whether you’re married or single, you can add a little oomph into
your love life by dancing as a couple or getting your body revved
up with dance. But what does this oomph have to do with low
blood sugar? Plenty! When you’re so often weary, down in the
dumps, or crabby as a result of your hypoglycemia, love and lust
can leach away and fizzle down to a most unfortunate finale. So if
your hypoglycemic syndrome has put a strain in your relationship,
what better way to put the sparkle back than through dance?
(Chapters 13 and 14 address relationship issues at length.)
If you’ve been sidelined by hypoglycemia for a long time, don’t
overdo it; ease yourself into any new activity. Find a class that’s
appropriate to your fitness level. Ballroom dancing and folk dance
are generally pretty safe choices. Make sure that you tell your
instructor about any physical or medical problems you may have.
Regulating Blood Sugar
with Yoga and T’ai Chi
Yoga and T’ai Chi (and related forms) are specifically designed to
promote mental, emotional, and spiritual growth along with physical
fitness. Although quite different in practice, T’ai Chi and yoga do
have similarities. They’re both comprehensive forms of exercise that
work the entire body, tone and build muscles, strengthen the organs
and musculoskeletal structure, and improve circulation of the qi
(also spelled ch’i) — the life force that courses through the body.
Both T’ai Chi and yoga fit well into comprehensive treatment pro-
grams for diabetes and hypoglycemia that involve mind, body, and
spirit. These ailments have a genetic component, but other con-
tributing factors are diet, sedentary habits, and physical, emo-
tional, and mental stress. All these factors are addressed in a
holistic manner in the practices of T’ai Chi and yoga. (Chapter 4
talks more about holistic and Eastern approaches, as well.)
So which should you study? It depends on what you like, what feels
most comfortable to you, and the instructors you can find. This
section can help you.
Going yoga
Yoga, which started in India, consists of poses you hold from a few
seconds to several minutes. Many forms, such as Hatha yoga and
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
148

Iyengar yoga, exist. Most forms include the same fundamental
poses, but some classes focus more on sweating, some on breath-
ing, and some on spirituality.
Numerous studies have reported the beneficial effect of yoga on
regulating blood sugar control. Some even venture to claim that
some cases of type 1 diabetes (what used to be known as juvenile
diabetes) were controlled through yoga. (Chapter 3 has more info
on diabetes.) The direct stimulation of the pancreas by certain
yogic postures seems to stimulate and rejuvenate the pancreatic
cells, which are responsible for producing insulin. Although the
studies only dealt with the effect on diabetes, the findings suggest
by implication that yoga is beneficial for hypoglycemia.
If you’re interested in trying yoga, check out Yoga For Dummies, by
Georg Feuerstein, Larry Payne, and Lilias Folan for a good starter,
or Yoga with Weights For Dummies, by Sherri Baptiste and Megan
Scott (both by Wiley) if you want to discover how to safely com-
bine working out with free weights while practicing yoga poses.
Taking T’ai Chi
T’ai Chi Chuan (also spelled “Taiji”) has often been described as
Chinese yoga. Because T’ai Chi is a set of smooth, flowing exer-
cises, people tend to forget that it’s a martial art. Although T’ai Chi
actively discourages violence, you can learn fighting skills, such as
sparring and self-defense. T’ai Chi is a soft, or internal, form of mar-
tial arts (as opposed to the hard external schools, such as Shaolin,
karate, or Tae Kwon Do). Unlike the hard schools of martial arts,
T’ai Chi is accessible to elderly or frail people, but it can also be
rigorous and demanding.
Unless you already have a background in martial arts, don’t
attempt to learn T’ai Chi from a video. Unlike aerobics or dance,
learning T’ai Chi properly without the physical presence of a quali-
fied instructor is extremely difficult, if not impossible. If you try to
learn T’ai Chi without an instructor, you’ll likely pick up bad habits
that will be hard to correct later on. Do yourself a favor and find a
class and instructor who you really like.
The best way to find a class you like is to get recommendations
from people you trust. You can also visit the Guang Ping Yang Tai
chi Chuan Web site (www.guangpingyang.org) and find a listing of
certified instructors. For more specific suggestions, check out T’ai
Chi For Dummies, by Therese Iknoian (Wiley). For a good beginning
introduction to T’ai Chi, go to www2.gol.com/users/ddh where
you can read free articles.
Chapter 8: Easing Symptoms and Energizing with Exercise 149

Although hydration is important when exercising, don’t drink liq-
uids for at least 15 minutes before practicing T’ai Chi. Avoid eating
30 minutes before and after practice. Unless you’re extremely
dehydrated, avoid drinking water (especially if the water’s cold)
during the practice. Drinking liquids can cool your body and
damper the really good flow of qi that your workout sets in motion.
Kicking Weakness with Weights
Exercising with weights may be very effective and helpful for people
who have problems with blood sugar balance. Good muscle tone
seems to improve cell ability to make good use of insulin and to help
the body regulate blood sugar levels.
You don’t need to become a muscle-bound lifter to benefit from
weight training. Building and toning muscle is one of the most
effective ways to boost your metabolism, lose weight, and increase
bone density (which can help stave off osteoporosis) for hypo-
glycemics and non-hypoglycemics alike.
Despite the claims of some high-profile exercise gurus, bodyweight
exercises don’t necessarily yield the same or better results com-
pared to lifting free weights or using weight machines. Different
exercises and techniques will yield different results for different
people. One exercise, or one way of doing it, isn’t necessarily
better or worse than another.
If you’re interested in working with weights, this section can get
you started by first explaining how bodyweight workouts can help
and then by explaining how you can ease into using free weights.
For more info, you can also check out Weight Training For
Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Liz Neporent, Suzanne Schlosberg, and
Shirley J. Archer (Wiley).
Building endurance with
bodyweight workouts
Bodyweight exercises use your full body weight, or as much of it as
possible, for resistance. They build and tone muscles to increase
your stamina, and to improve your overall conditioning. You can do
bodyweight exercises anytime, anywhere, with no special equip-
ment or facilities. Although bodyweight exercises aren’t new,
they’re enjoying a recent surge of interest among people who want
the benefit of weight-bearing or weight-resistance exercises without
the hassle of buying and using free weights or going to the gym.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
150

If you’re suffering from chronic hypoglycemia, bodyweight exer-
cises are a good way to start building muscle mass and tone to
help body cells use insulin more effectively. This kind of exercise
will help keep your hypoglycemia from progressing to the next
stage, insulin resistance. (Flip to Chapter 3 for more.)
Bodyweight exercises are easier to get started with than traditional
weight-lifting regimens. In addition, they require no additional
equipment, and individuals may feel less resistance (no pun
intended) about doing these exercises.
Some examples of bodyweight exercises include
 Push-ups
 Pull-ups
 Squats
 Calisthenics
 Gymnastic movements, such as the planche (a movement
involving arching of the body) and the front lever (a move-
ment involving hollowing of the body)
 Yoga
If you’ve never worked out before, start with easy, basic exercises
such as push-ups or leg raises. Any one of the preceding exercises
is suitable. If you know nothing about exercise, enroll in a good
class so that you can discover how to do the movements properly,
without injuring yourself.
Advocates of bodyweight exercises typically emphasize the impor-
tance of repetition. For example, doing 100 or even 500 squats defi-
nitely teaches you something about endurance! As with any
exercise, the key is to start slow and gradually build up to the
desired number of repetitions. (Note: Some trainers advise against
doing more than 150 repetitions of any exercise on a regular basis.
Moderation helps avoid the possibility of causing a repetitive
stress or strain injury.)
Calisthenics typically involve movement against relatively little
weight resistance. Examples include swinging your arms in circles
or touching your toes. Calisthenics work against much less of your
body weight than typical bodyweight exercises.
Many people effectively combine calisthenics, gymnastic move-
ments, and even yoga with other exercises in their workout
routines. There’s little point in arguing about what is or isn’t
bodyweight exercise — if you have time to be arguing, you’re
better off exercising!
Chapter 8: Easing Symptoms and Energizing with Exercise 151

Easing into free weights
with body weights
When you’re feeling fitter and can bid adieu to hypoglycemic
symptoms, you can transition into actually working with free
weights or weight machines if you want to.
Before you start actually using free weights or weight machines,
make sure you get guidance from a professional. You can find a lot
of information and misinformation out there. For example, fitness
and weight-lifting magazine articles are frequently intended more
to sell products rather than to inform. In some cases, the buffed-up
models gracing the magazine pages may not have even tried the
product or program they’re selling. Don’t be fooled by the glossy
sales and marketing techniques.
Make sure you have a spotter (someone to help you lift the dumb-
bell on and off the rack) when you’re working with weights.
Spotters can help you if you have trouble completing a set and
keep you from getting hurt. And don’t be too cavalier when han-
dling dumbbells and other weights.
In addition to helping spot you, a personal trainer or qualified
person from your gym can ensure that you’re getting the proper
workout and that you’re correctly using the weights. Make sure
that you know how to lift weights correctly before lifting them solo
at home, unless you’re using only 1- to 5-pound dumbbells. Even
then, proper training is important.
Don’t be misled by high-profile exercise gurus or self-styled “fit-
ness celebrities” flogging expensive DVDs, CDs, books, Web sites
with hefty membership fees, and so on. The same information may
be available elsewhere for free (for example, try a simple Internet
search or visit your local public library). You don’t have to spend
big bucks to get into shape. Balancing and regulating your blood
sugar and keeping yourself healthy are more about sticking to your
diet and regular exercise program.
Incorporating free weights
into your exercise regimen
Make sure that you consult your doctor before you begin any exer-
cise regimen. This caveat is true for anyone, but particularly for
individuals who suffer from chronic health conditions like hypo-
glycemia. You can hurt yourself if you get dizzy during a workout
session.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
152

Proceed slowly when incorporating free weights. Start with dumb-
bells weighing about 1.5 to 3 pounds, depending on your gender
and fitness level. (Men can generally lift more weight than women.)
Using lighter weights is safer and can be just as effective as heavier
weights if you do enough repetitions. You can combine a few free
weight exercises (such as bicep curls) with your aerobic or other
exercise regimen. For example, you may do some resistance exer-
cises before or after an aerobic workout. In the beginning, don’t lift
weights for longer than 10 or 15 minutes.
You can gradually increase the time, as well as the weights.
Because each person is so different, we can’t map out an exercise
plan that will suit everyone. For best results, keep an exercise log
and vary your routine so you cover all parts of the body.
Clearing Brain Fog with Qigong
Brain fog is mental confusion, a feeling that often accompanies
hypoglycemia. (For more on brain fog, see Chapter 3.) And what is
qigong? Simply put, it’s a Chinese system of physical training, phi-
losophy, and comprehensive preventive and therapeutic health-
care that involves breathing exercises and meditation. It’s
somewhat related to T’ai Chi and other soft forms of martial arts,
but it doesn’t have any of the hard elements of martial arts, such
as kicks and strikes. (For more info on the various forms of martial
arts, see the nearby sidebar, “Mastering the martials.”)
The qi in qigong refers to breath, vital essence, and life force; gong
means skill, work, and self-discipline. Many scientific studies have
been done on the numerous benefits of qigong. Most importantly for
hypoglycemics, qigong has been found to help regulate blood sugar
by strengthening the endocrine system, blood sugar’s regulator.
You can use qigong to gain, attain, and maintain vibrant health,
helping to strengthen the body. Qigong can also strengthen the
blood and immune system and energize the brain. If you do it right,
you’ll be better able to sense your body, which can help you tune
in to the diet your body actually needs, rather than to what an out-
side authority or some school of thought tells you.
There are more than 3,000 varieties of qigong. Proper instruction is
important (just like T’ai Chi, you can’t really learn qigong through a
book or a video, although you can use those tools as supplements),
and so is regular practice. You need to have patience, persistence,
and commitment to enjoy the full benefits of qigong. Give qigong a
minimum of three months and up to a year before expecting to see
Chapter 8: Easing Symptoms and Energizing with Exercise 153

any changes. If you want to find out more information about qigong,
check out the National Qigong Association site (www.nqa.org), pur-
chase or rent qigong DVDs, or sit in on a qigong class.
Be aware that many charlatans claim to be qigong masters. We
can’t give you a formula for telling who’s legitimate and who’s not.
Try to get personal recommendations. Generally, beware of anyone
who claims to be able to heal everything under the sun with only a
few exercises, especially if the person charges an exorbitant fee for
his classes or services.
Avoid sexual intercourse for at least one hour before and after a
qigong session. Having sex an hour before or after a session may
interfere with your training because it can impede the flow of qi.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
154
Mastering the martials
Studying the fighting arts for your health is something you may want to consider.
Through the practice, you’ll cultivate discipline, commitment, self-confidence,
strength, and directness of purpose — the diametric opposite of how you are when
weak and debilitated by your system’s metabolic glitch. It’ll definitely clear any cob-
webs in your brain and make your thinking sharp. You’ll hardly remember what brain
fog was like. To start:
 Do a little research to find out which martial arts may appeal to you most.
 Make sure that you find a true master of the arts.
 Beware of anyone who claims that his particular style of martial arts is the one
and only, who claims to know all the answers, or who demands an inordinate
amount of your time and/or money. If anyone starts asking for your firstborn, it’s
a sure sign that you should bail out!
Strictly from a health standpoint, the soft, or internal, school of martial arts (like T’ai
Chi) is generally considered more effective. The internal school of martial arts
emphasizes the cultivation of qi (instead of brute force) and teaches you how to use
your opponent’s strength against him.
Then there’s kickboxing, which has found adherents among women, and Tae Bo,
which incorporates moves from martial arts for an aerobic workout — so it’s not
exactly a martial art per se. (Kickboxing and Tae Bo are considered hard forms.)
Then, of course, you have your traditional martial arts from China, Japan, Korea,
and other countries. Aside from T’ai Chi, other internal schools of martial arts include
Hsing Yi and Bagua Zhang.

H
ave you been swinging high, swinging low, singing the blood
sugar blues? Stress can do that to you. Ah, but don’t get
stressed-out over stress. Knowing how to handle stress can help
you handle your hypoglycemia. This chapter provides hands-on
info so you can relax and meditate.
How Stress Impacts Your
Hypoglycemia
Stress can hinder attempts to balance your blood sugar level.
When you’re stressed, a series of biochemical changes takes place
to prepare you to deal with your stressors: the old fight-or-flight
response. When primitive man saw a saber-toothed tiger, he
needed a burst of energy to fight or flee from the predator. Unless
you’re a big game hunter, you don’t often run into hungry tigers or
lions. Today, you’re more likely to encounter threats in the form of
job layoffs or work deadlines. But just like in the good ol’ days of
yore, the adrenal glands continue to pump you full of adrenaline so
that you can either hightail it out of there or do battle. When you
deal with stress day after day, your body begins to break down.
To compound the problem, many people turn to food when they’re
faced with continued stress. We sure don’t need to tell you that
most people aren’t grabbing a celery stick or a bowl of steamed

green beans to help themselves deal with stress. Alas, they use
sugar as a quick pick-me-up. In response to the sugar, the body
secretes too much insulin, as well as — guess what — more adren-
aline! And the vicious cycle is perpetuated. This cycle is even more
vicious if you happen to be hypoglycemic, because you already
have a problem balancing your blood sugar.
Stress may cause, or at least exacerbate, the symptoms of low
blood sugar. Some healthcare practitioners suspect that the body’s
inability to deal effectively with stress may be at the root of most
manifestations of hypoglycemia. Some even believe that stress is
one of the key factors, a hidden cause of not only hypoglycemia
but also all diseases. Not enough studies have been done to con-
clusively support this hypothesis. But you don’t need a whole lot
of science to convince most people that too much stress just doesn’t
agree with their system.
Determining Your Stress Level
If you know you’re already stressed, feel free to gloss over this sec-
tion. You can jump to the remaining sections in this chapter that
help you relax. Even if you’re stressed, you may be tempted to skip
this section because you think it’s “only stress.” After all, stress is
no big deal; it’s not like it’s a disease or anything, right? Wrong.
Stress is at the root of many illnesses. Even if it’s not the direct
cause of an ailment, it can be a contributing factor. At the very
least it makes life worse, not better, and the road to recovery from
an illness much rockier.
So if you can, we urge you to take a moment to discover how to de-
stress and de-compress. The little bit of time you spend busting
stress can pay dividends many times over.
Before you can discover how to relax your muscles, you need to
recognize when and why they’re tense. You can recognize the ten-
sion by consciously tuning in to your body. If you live primarily in
your head, you’re more likely to lend your ears to telemarketers
than to your own body. Now you have a chance to get in touch
with how your body feels.
Take the Life Stress Test, developed in 1997 by Dr. Tim Lowenstein
to help determine how stressed you are, at www.cliving.org/
lifestresstest.htm. The test is similar to the Holmes Rahe Social
Adjustment Rating Scale test, which you can find at: www.cop.ufl.
edu/safezone/doty/dotyhome/wellness/HolRah.htm. This
stress test is valid whether you have blood sugar imbalances or
not. You’ll notice that each life event has a number assigned to it,
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
156

from a low of 10 to a high of 100. (Just add up the points for what
you’re experiencing in your life.)
Knotting Off: Relaxing
Your Tight Muscles
Because stress can have an adverse effect on your body, figuring out
how to handle and get rid of it is critical. The art of relaxation — and
it truly is an art — is the key to healthy living. If you suffer from
hypoglycemia (and even other health conditions), you can alleviate
many hypoglycemic symptoms with proper relaxation techniques. If
you’re sugar-balance-challenged, you will find these techniques
indispensable as you transition to a healthier diet. Making healthy
changes doesn’t have to be a grin-and-bear-it situation. If you use
the methods outlined here and take the vitamins that help to curb
any food cravings (see Chapter 7 for supplements and other natural
remedies), you’ll be able to make a smooth transition to a healthy
lifestyle.
The following progressive muscle relaxation exercise helps you
feel the difference between relaxed and tense muscles. It also helps
you discover how to loosen up those tightly wound muscles. When
performing this exercise, avoid overstraining yourself. Simply
follow these instructions:
1. Go somewhere quiet where you won’t be disturbed.
2. Lie down on a bed (or wherever you can get comfortable).
3. Loosen any clothes that may be too tight.
4. Take a few breaths in and out.
5. Place your hand on your stomach and breathe in deeply
while you press down.
Feel how your stomach expands when you breathe deeply.
6. Tense your feet and curl your toes downward.
Hold for a few seconds and then release. Don’t hold your
breath. Breathe normally for the rest of the exercise.
7. Tense your calves so that your toes are bent toward your
face.
Don’t tighten so much that you get cramps. Hold for a few
seconds and then relax.
8. Tighten your sphincter muscles (in the anal region).
Hold and release.
Chapter 9: All Stressed Out and Nowhere to Go 157

9. Tighten your buttocks and thighs.
Hold and release. Feel the difference between tight and
relaxed muscles.
10. Clench your fists as you also tighten your forearms and
upper arms.
Hold for a few seconds and then release.
11. Shrug your shoulders and bring them up toward your ears.
Hold and release.
12. Tighten your stomach.
Hold and release.
13. Arch your back without straining.
Hold and release. Be very careful if you have a back problem.
14. Open your mouth wide and feel the tension in your jaw
and neck.
Be careful not to tense up too much, because you may hurt
yourself. Hold for a few seconds and then relax. Your lips
should be slightly parted.
15. Squeeze your eyes closed tight and then relax.
Keep your eyes closed and feel the warmth spread across
your eyelids.
16. Raise your eyebrows as high as they will go so that your
forehead gets wrinkled.
Hold and release. Smooth out your forehead completely.
17. Tense your entire body.
Hold for several seconds and then release. Repeat this step
two more times. When you’re finished, you should feel a
pleasant wave of relaxation sweep over you. All your mus-
cles will feel loose and soft. Try to remember this sensation.
With this exercise, you feel how the sensations of tension and
relaxation differ. It lets you know how you’re supposed to feel
when you’re relaxed. As you keep practicing, inducing this state of
relaxation becomes easier. For instance, assume that you agree to
go out to eat with your friends even though you feel somewhat
volatile. Then, someone suggests chipping in on a meal that’s defi-
nitely off-limits for you. You don’t want the situation to stress you
out. You need to be able to take care of yourself without antagoniz-
ing anyone. What should you do? At times like this, you can do a
mini-version of the muscle relaxation technique by tensing the
muscles of your arms and legs and then releasing them. This short-
ened version will help diffuse any tension you may feel.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
158

Although you may start noticing improvements almost immedi-
ately, it may be weeks or months before you’re free of the physical
and emotional problems associated with hypoglycemia. However,
you can gain immediate relief by the progressive relaxation of your
muscles. The relaxation exercises help with anxiety, depression,
and fatigue, among other things, and unlike medication, they don’t
cause any negative side effects.
Taking a Deep Breath to Relax
Do you want a quick, fast stress fix? Something that will deliver an
instant boost, get you turbocharged, and make you tingle with life
and energy? Okay, then take a deep breath. And then another.
There you have it: Breathing is the elixir of life. Breathing is some-
thing you can do at any time. And it costs absolutely nothing.
This section looks at how breathing can help your blood sugar. In
this section, we also provide two breathing exercises — one for
when you’re in a hurry and another for when you have extra time
to really inhale.
Breathing helps regulate
your blood sugar
Breathing helps you become less irritated, less depressed, and less
prone to such problems as panic attacks, anxiety, muscle tension,
headaches, and fatigue (all of which are symptoms of hypo-
glycemia). That’s right, deep breathing can help you alleviate many
distressing symptoms and at the same time help regulate your
blood sugar. It can also help you beat food addictions and food
cravings.
People have attested to giving up all kinds of addictions, such as
cigarette smoking and candy bars, just by deep breathing. Despite
all the benefits gained from deep breathing, most people are under-
breathers who are totally stingy about the way they breathe.
(You’d think that they were being charged by the minute or the
gallon.) Unless you’re the exception, you probably suffer from a
lack of serious breathing (especially if you have any health issues,
including hypoglycemia).
In addition to your regular deep-breathing sessions, you should
switch to your deep-breathing mode when you feel
 Dizzy
 Lightheaded
Chapter 9: All Stressed Out and Nowhere to Go 159

 Irritated
 Angry
 Anxious
 Fatigued
 Achy
 Cravings for sugar or simple starches (cakes, croissants,
colas, fries, and so on)
Trying some deep-breathing
exercises to relax
When you’re stressing over daily problems, you may feel like you
have no time to relax. Other times you may have an hour to wind
down, but you’re so worked up that you don’t know how to take
a chill pill. This section provides you with two deep breathing
techniques.
The great thing about these breathing exercises is that they make
you feel instantly revived. You’ll get the most benefit, though, if
you make these exercises a regular practice. After several months
of these breathing exercises, you may even be able to blow down
a brick house (although I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for that
to happen). At the very least, your friends will be impressed by
the dynamo that you’ve become. Just don’t try deep breathing
on the phone.
The quickie method
This technique is a handy-dandy way to perk you up anytime you’re
feeling dragged out. It can be a good way to start out the morning.
Come to think of it, you may want to use it to end the day, too.
Just follow these easy steps on your way to stress relief:
1. Inhale through your nose for a count of four to six (as
many you can manage comfortably).
2. Hold the air in your lungs for a count of four to six.
Hold for the same number of counts as your inhalation. In
other words, if you inhaled for a count of four, hold for a
count of four.
3. Exhale through your nose for a count of four to six.
If you inhaled for a count of four, exhale for a count of four.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
160

Feel free to use this technique as much as you want. Are you sitting
at a long traffic light and have two minutes? Waiting in the dentist’s
office before your appointment? Take a deep breath and relax.
The drawn-out method
When you have a bit more alone time, turn off your phone and tele-
vision, and practice the following deep-breathing technique.
Plan to spend up to 20 minutes breathing in and out, and follow
these steps for deep breathing:
1. Lie down on a rug or exercise mat on the floor and bend
your knees, keeping your feet about shoulder width apart.
2. Relax any areas of your body that are tight.
If you like, do the progressive muscle relaxation technique
that we describe earlier in this chapter.
3. Keep your mouth closed but relaxed.
4. Put one hand on your chest and the other on your
stomach.
5. Breathe in deeply through your nose to the count of five.
Your abdomen should push up into your hand as much as
possible. Your chest, however, should move only slightly.
The hand on your chest will allow you to determine
whether you’re moving your chest too much.
6. Exhale through your mouth.
7. Continue deep breathing for 5 to 20 minutes.
Surfing the Alpha Wave
with Meditation
Meditation occurs when you become relaxed and have a height-
ened sense of alertness. This effective antidote for stress and ten-
sion induces mental tranquility and physical relaxation, reduces
high blood pressure, and improves circulation. Studies also show
that meditating can boost the intensity of alpha waves, brain
waves associated with quiet, receptive states of the mind that are
conducive to relaxation and creativity.
For all you hyper-driven go-getters, rest assured that meditating
isn’t the same as vegetating. Nor does meditating have to be any-
thing quaint or mystical — you don’t have to sprout a beard and
sit in the lotus position in front of a temple. Think of meditation as
Chapter 9: All Stressed Out and Nowhere to Go 161

a way of focusing your mind on one thing. If you’re confused, dis-
tracted, or anxious — all side effects of low blood sugar — medita-
tion can help you to not only concentrate but also achieve
serenity. Countless studies have shown the benefit of regular medi-
tation in relieving stress and promoting good health. Meditation
helps alleviate high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, arthri-
tis, anxiety, depression, and so on. It can definitely aid you in regu-
lating your blood sugar and anything else that’s off kilter.
This section explains how you can use meditation in several differ-
ent ways to relax, get energized, and even kick food cravings to the
curb.
Balancing your blood and body
Some doctors suspect that the symptoms of hypoglycemia may be
caused more by the release of stress hormones than by low blood
sugar. If this theory is true, hypoglycemics should be able to dras-
tically reduce the frequency and severity of their symptoms
through the practice of meditation. It’s been scientifically proven
that meditating on a regular basis can relieve chronic pain, lower
levels of stress hormones, and improve circulation.
A smorgasbord of meditations is out there for you to choose from.
You can try Zen meditation, transcendental meditation, Tibetan
Buddhist meditation, Taoist meditation, and insight meditation
(also called Vipassana), to name just a few. Check out Meditation
For Dummies, by Stephan Bodian (Wiley), for further information.
Starting with some simple oms
To start off, meditate for just five minutes a day. If you make medi-
tation a habit, you’ll be able to gradually go longer. Experienced
practitioners meditate for an hour or even longer. Meditate for the
amount of time that fits your schedule, but do make meditation a
regular practice. The important thing is to meditate every day. As
with anything, practice, patience, and persistence are what count
the most.
Before you start meditating, turn off the TV, and if possible, put
yourself in a room where you can close the door — and put up a
“Do Not Disturb” sign. If you can’t lock yourself in a room, do the
best you can. Ask the people around you not to disturb you while
you meditate. Meditating can be a bit tricky if you have small chil-
dren. See if you can get a friendly neighbor to help you out. If not,
try meditating for five minutes at a time.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
162

Here’s a simple meditation using a mantra (a type of incantation or
affirmation):
1. Sit in a chair or on the floor.
Sit wherever is most comfortable for you. Keep your back
straight.
2. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, relax, and try
to quiet your mind.
3. Repeat the word om silently to yourself.
Or make up a hypo-specific mantra, such as “I’m becoming
healthier.” Don’t worry if you keep having distracting
thoughts. Just bring your awareness back to the mantra
and continue repeating it. Try it for anywhere from 5 to
20 minutes.
4. Take a few deep breaths and slowly open your eyes.
You may be aware of a lot of thoughts during this meditation. You
may even forget that you’re supposed to be meditating. (Don’t
worry if you do; most people have that experience.) Through regu-
lar meditation practice, you can discover how to train the monkey
mind, that unruly, undisciplined mind that flits from one thought to
the next. When your mind chatter is turned down to a reasonable
volume, you may find your mind becoming serene — more like the
surface of a quiet lake rather than a turbulent stream.
Focusing on your breathing to meditate
If you don’t like repeating words, you may want to try another
basic meditation where you pay attention to your breathing. This
meditation is great for toning the belly and helping relieve consti-
pation. It’s also a great way to relax before a test or an interview.
Here’s a variation from a Taoist form of meditation:
1. Sit in a chair or cross-legged on the floor.
Keep your back straight and your shoulders relaxed and
sloping downward. Avoid jutting out your chin: It should be
tucked in slightly, but not too much.
2. Relax your jaw and lightly touch your tongue on the
inside of your upper front teeth.
3. Close your eyes partially so that you’re gazing softly
downward, not focusing on anything.
Chapter 9: All Stressed Out and Nowhere to Go 163

4. Bring your attention to your Dan Tien, which is located
inside your abdomen about an inch below your belly
button.
Think of the Dan Tien as your energy center, the cauldron
in your belly. Dan Tien is the reservoir for your qi, or life
force. You can read more about Dan Tien in T’ai Chi For
Dummies, by Therese Iknoian (Wiley). There are other loca-
tions for the Dan Tien, but this spot suits the purposes of
this exercise.
5. Inhale deeply as you expand your abdomen.
6. Exhale as you contract your abdomen.
Keep your attention lightly centered on the Dan Tien as you
inhale and exhale.
Aside from your regular sessions, you can meditate whenever you
experience any pain or discomfort from the side effects of low
blood sugar. Meditation can help enormously as you change to
healthier eating habits. It can help lessen your mood swings; the
contrast between the hills and valleys that you experience won’t
be quite so sharp. If you find yourself going up and down emotion-
ally, try meditation, breathing exercises, or progressive muscle
relaxation. Or combine all three!
Energizing with EFT
One unusual way of beating stress — and hypoglycemia — is a
nontraditional psychotherapy called Emotional Freedom
Technique (EFT), also known as meridian therapy, or energy medi-
cine. EFT is like acupuncture without needles. It helps calm your
mind and balance your energy. It’s one of the more popular forms
of a healing modality based on energy medicine (see Chapter 4 for
more on alternative medicine). Practitioners claim that EFT can
provide quick relief from pain, diseases, and emotional issues.
Mental health professionals, alternative healthcare practitioners,
and even some medical doctors are increasingly utilizing EFT. One
reason EFT is becoming so popular is that it’s fast, easy to learn,
and you can do it on yourself.
What is EFT?
The term meridian therapy came about because EFT is based on
the same energy meridians used in traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM) to treat physical and emotional ailments. The premise is
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
164

that meridians are connected to bodily organs and functions, and
they act as channels through which the body’s vital energy (qi or
chi) circulates. Illnesses are caused by disruptions in this flow of
qi. Blockages in the meridians act like dams that keep the river-
water from nourishing the land it’s flowing through. Traditional
acupuncture attempts to treat illnesses by clearing such blocks
and restoring energetic balance.
EFT works in a manner similar to acupuncture — it attempts to
restore harmony by clearing energetic blockages. That’s why EFT is
sometimes described as psychological acupuncture. It brings the prin-
ciples of acupuncture into the practice of psychotherapy by treating
emotional as well as physical issues. But — and you’ll be relieved to
hear this — there are no needles involved. All that’s necessary are
your fingertips for tapping on the various meridian points.
EFT practitioners believe that unresolved negative emotions are the
major contributors to most physical pains and diseases. Negative
emotions impede and disrupt the body’s qi. Because the emotions
are connected to physical pains and diseases, when you clear them
out, the corresponding physical illness or discomfort is gone.
Using EFT to relax
According to EFT founder Gary Craig, clearing negative emotions
and residues of emotional trauma by digging into unresolved
issues from childhood may allow the body to heal itself. The body
will then become effective at maintaining a good blood sugar bal-
ance. The individual may even find that foods that used to put the
body into a tailspin no longer cause problems. (This doesn’t, of
course, negate the importance of eating a proper diet; it just means
that you have a little more leeway about what you do or don’t eat.)
EFT can also be used to reduce or eliminate any of the symptoms
of hypoglycemia, such as headaches and dizziness. Follow these
steps to try EFT treatment:
1. Focus on a disturbing memory, emotion, or specific issue
(such as a traumatic event or addiction).
You can use EFT also on specific hypoglycemic symptoms
such as dizziness, headaches, irritability, and so forth. If
there are emotional issues you believe may be triggering
your symptoms, you can address them with EFT.
This exercise is supposed to remove the emotional block
from the body’s energy system, thus restoring it to har-
mony and balance. This restoration then helps heal the
physical disease.
Chapter 9: All Stressed Out and Nowhere to Go 165

2. Start with a setup phrase that sets the stage for an EFT
treatment.
For example, if you’re trying to work on a hypoglycemic
symptom such as a headache, the setup phrase may go
something like this: “Even though I have a headache (or I
have a deep/dull/throbbing pain in the right/left/front/back
side of my head), I deeply and completely love and accept
myself.”
Apply this phrase to the specific event, emotion, or condi-
tion in question. Make an attempt to accept that experience
and reaffirm love and acceptance of yourself. You don’t
have to believe the setup phrase or subsequent statements
for EFT to work.
3. Repeat the setup phrase and tap the “karate chop” merid-
ian point at the side of the hand (see Figure 9-1).
Figure 9-1: Use the area outside the hand to deliver light karate taps.
4. Tap the following points (see Figure 9-2) using the
reminder phrase, which keeps your mind and body
tuned into the issue that you’re addressing:
• Top of the head (H)
• Toward the inside of the eyebrows and slightly above
them (EB)
• Outside corner of the eyes, on the side (SE)
• On opposite sides of the face; under the center of the
eyes (UE)
• Midway between the nose and the upper lip (UN)
• Midway between the lower lip and the chin (CH)

• Two points at the beginning of the collarbone at the
edge where it meets the breastbone (CB)
• Under the arms, about three to four inches below the
armpit, roughly level with the chest (UA)
You can tap three or more times on each point. There are no
hard and fast rules about this. There are a few other points
as well, but these are the most commonly used. An example
of a reminder phrase (if you’re working on a headache) is
“This headache (or this dull pain in the side of my head —
or whatever is true about what you’re experiencing).”
Figure 9-2: Tap these meridian points.
Identifying the pros and cons of using EFT
You can try EFT on any hypoglycemic symptom. But make sure
you’re eating at regular intervals. And, if you’re a diabetic who
experiences a sudden drop in blood sugar, you must follow your
doctor’s instructions on dealing with such emergencies. This may
mean taking glucose tablets or drinking orange juice to quickly
raise the blood sugar.

The following are advantages of EFT:
 Easy to learn
 Simple to use
 Quick
 Requires no special equipment
 You can do it anywhere
 Takes only a few minutes
Even if you’re in a public place, if you suddenly feel any physical or
emotional discomforts, or simply feel stressed, you can excuse
yourself to the bathroom to do a quick round or two of tapping.
The biggest disadvantage of EFT is that as a healing technique, it’s
currently controversial. A few studies have been done, but nothing
conclusively demonstrates that EFT works as its proponents claim.
All evidence for EFT benefits is anecdotal. No one has reported any
adverse effects from EFT.
Using EFT effectively and proficiently requires additional study;
watch DVDs, take a class or two, or read up on the subject. We
urge you to check out Gary Craig’s Web site at www.emofree.com
to discover how to use EFT properly.
If you suspect that you may be suffering from symptoms of chronic
hypoglycemia, always consult your physician and get a thorough
medical checkup before choosing a further course of action. Never
attempt to diagnose or treat yourself without the assistance of a
qualified medical practitioner.
Kicking food cravings in the gut
Because stress can trigger cravings for all the wrong foods —
sugar, sugar, and more sugar! — meditation, which alleviates
stress, can be especially beneficial. So are stress-busting exercises
like yoga and T’ai Chi. Just practicing them may help cut down on
your cravings. (See Chapter 8 for more info on yoga and T’ai Chi.)
Meditating away your cravings
As you develop mindfulness with meditation, you become more
aware of your eating habits. As much as people may be obsessed
with food, most don’t pay sufficient attention to what they’re eating.
In fact, many people seem to go almost unconscious when they eat.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
168

To become more conscious about your eating, try the following
meditation:
1. Pick a time when you’re home alone.
If you live with people, do the meditation in your room or
somewhere you can have privacy, and ask everyone not to
disturb you.
2. Place the food in front of you.
This can be any food (good, bad, or indifferent) that you’re
about to eat. The object is to become more aware of what
you’re eating.
3. Take several deep breaths.
4. Note the color, shape, and texture of the food.
• Note any reactions you have. How do you feel about
the food? Does it look appealing to you?
• Notice how your body reacts to the food. What phys-
ical sensations do you have?
5. Now bring the food to your mouth.
• Smell the food. What is your reaction to the smell?
• Take a bite. How does it feel to bite into the food?
• Chew the food. How does the food feel to your lips,
teeth, and tongue? What other sensations do you
notice?
• As you swallow the food, pay attention to how your
esophagus contracts and relaxes. Can you feel the
food traveling down to your stomach?
• Note how your stomach feels after you swallow
the food.
6. Put the food down between bites and breathe deeply.
7. Take another bite.
Again, pay attention to all the sensations.
This meditation helps you become more conscious of the act of
eating. You can also try this meditation when you’re eating a for-
bidden food. Rather than cram your food down in a rush or with a
feeling of guilt, be as fully conscious as you can when you eat. And
enjoy what you’re eating! If paying attention to all the details gets
tedious after awhile, just remain focused on the taste and smell of
the food, and relish it as much as you can.
Chapter 9: All Stressed Out and Nowhere to Go 169

Using EFT to fight food cravings
Many people report that with the help of EFT, they’ve been able
to reduce or eliminate cravings for sugar and other food. (Check
out “Energizing with EFT” earlier in this chapter for more info
about EFT.)
Consider the following when trying EFT with food cravings:
1. Judge the intensity of the craving, using a simple scale
of 0 to 10.
On this scale, 0 means least intense and 10 most intense.
2. Follow the steps that we describe in “Using EFT to relax,”
earlier in this chapter.
3. While tapping the karate chop meridian point, say the
following to yourself as a setup phrase:
• Even though I’m really craving this piece of cake and I
want to take a bite right now, I deeply and completely
love and accept myself.
4. Tap the sequence of meridian points, and repeat a
reminder phrase to yourself, such as:
• Craving this cake. (Choose any reminder phrase that
works well for you, such as “I really want to eat this,” “I
desire this cake intensely,” or “I really need this cake!”)
You may think that repeating a phrase like this will only
intensify the craving. In fact, by stating the truth of how
you’re feeling at the moment, you help to release it.
5. Rate the intensity of the craving again.
Is it less intense? Is it completely gone? Repeat the tapping
sequence until you no longer crave the food.
You can make up your own setup and reminder phrases according
to your own needs and your own situation. Do whatever works
best for you. For best results, combine EFT with other techniques
for reducing or eliminating food cravings. (Check out Chapter 16
for some additional self-help hints.)
Making the Ultimate Smoothie:
Hypno-Soothing
Self-hypnosis is another tool you can use if you hit rough patches
in your effort to transition to a hypoglycemic diet. You can use it to
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
170

help stick to your food plan or alleviate uncomfortable hypo-
glycemic symptoms.
Don’t be spooked by the word hypnosis. It’s not witchcraft, and it’s
not a séance. And you won’t be clucking around like a hen either,
because self-hypnosis isn’t the same as stage hypnosis, where the
focus is on showmanship rather than healing. You can find it very
relaxing, in fact. With self-hypnosis, you’re the one in charge. You
maintain total control. It’s not dangerous, and you can do it alone.
You can hypnotize yourself in many different ways. Here’s one
simple method:
1. Pick a quiet time and place where you won’t be disturbed.
2. Play soothing music if you think that it may help you,
especially if background noise is a problem.
3. Lie down where you can be comfortable.
If you find that you keep falling asleep when you try to hyp-
notize yourself, sit in a chair.
4. Inhale slowly and deeply.
Hold your breath and exhale slowly. Each time you exhale,
imagine that you’re releasing all your tension.
5. Use the progressive muscle relaxation technique
described in “Knotting off: Relaxing Your Tight Muscles”
earlier in this chapter to help release all your tensions.
Work from your toes up, relaxing each muscle group.
6. If your neck is stiff, do a few slow head rolls and really
work to get your muscles relaxed.
7. Take as much time as you need to get fully relaxed.
It will take longer in the beginning, but later you’ll achieve
relaxation quickly.
8. Imagine that you’re in an elevator.
The floor indicator shows that you’re on the 50th floor. The
elevator begins to go down at a steady pace, not too fast, not
too slow. You’re on the 49th floor, and you’re going down,
down, down. Continue breathing deeply and slowly as you
watch the numbers go down . . . 48th, 47th, and so on.
If thoughts or other images intrude, just gently brush them
aside.
With each breath, you’re going deeper and deeper.
Chapter 9: All Stressed Out and Nowhere to Go 171

9. When the elevator arrives at the first floor, you’re ready
to give yourself suggestions.
10. You should now give yourself autosuggestions.
Autosuggestions are statements that you repeat while in a
hypnotic state to influence your own attitudes and behav-
ior. Use words and statements that make sense to you,
because they’ll be more effective.
For example, you can say, “I naturally gravitate toward
healthy foods,” or “I’m finding it easier and easier to eat a
healthy diet with plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits,” or
“I can now easily pass up processed foods that are filled
with sugar and starch.”
You can also make up statements to help ease your symp-
toms, such as, “I am now happy and emotionally balanced,
and I’m becoming more and more energetic each day.”
Make all your statements affirmative and in the present
tense. Don’t say, “I will not eat dessert anymore.” Instead
try, “I no longer have a desire for desserts that are full of
sugar.”
After you make your suggestion, you’re ready to terminate
the session.
11. Terminate your session by counting to three.
Say, “I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of
three, I’ll be totally refreshed, wide awake, and completely
alert. One — I’m beginning to come out of it. Two — I’m
coming out more, ready to wake up. Three — I’m wide
awake, feeling refreshed and revitalized.”
As with anything, you need to set up a regular time of practice, and
you need to do it consistently, or you won’t get the results you
want. You won’t get instant results, but you should start to see
some changes in a few weeks. If you don’t notice changes during
this time, examine your suggestions and try different ones. If you
feel you need more support and advice on what to do, consider
trying one of the numerous books and tapes on self-hypnosis.
However, the information outlined here should be enough to get
you going.

Defanging the Depression
Demons

W
atch out for the demons of depression. If you have chronic
problems with low blood sugar, they’re sure to attack you
sooner or later. Of course, they’re not real demons with horns and
fangs. In a way, though, these demons are much more frightening,
because they’re invisible and they attack one of your most vulner-
able areas — your state of mind.
Why is depression one of hypoglycemia’s main symptoms?
Because its sisters — anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, feel-
ings of panic, and suicidal tendencies — are just a few things hypo-
glycemia can create. Hypoglycemics also tend to suffer from
temper tantrums, mood swings, and crying jags. (See Chapter 3 for
more symptom info.) These symptoms aren’t surprising, consider-
ing that the brain uses glucose as its fuel. When you don’t have
enough glucose circulating in your blood, your brain begins to
starve. At rest, the brain consumes a third of the body’s total glu-
cose requirement.
This chapter sheds light on how to deal with stresses that may be
keeping you hooked to the hypoglycemic cycle of eating the wrong
foods, making you feel even sicker and causing you to reach for
foods that trigger bouts of hypoglycemia . . . and on and on.

Revealing Another Epidemic
According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), an
estimated 6.7 million people in established market economies,
such as the United States, suffer from depression. That’s 6.8 per-
cent of the population. In fact, major depression (not just your
ordinary everyday blues, but a serious medical condition) is the
leading cause of disability worldwide. These statistics may seem
misleading, because many people are unaware of their depression,
and others resist seeking proper treatment. Depression still tends
to be regarded as a character defect or a weakness of will rather
than as a multifaceted illness.
Depression is not only the most undertreated medical illness, but
also the most treatable. Treatment is said to be effective in more
than 80 percent of cases. Perhaps most of the cases that have been
resistant to treatment can be affected through proper dietary
changes.
To help you recognize the symptoms of depression in yourself and
others, here are some questions adapted from the National
Institutes of Health:
 Are you persistently sad?
 Do you feel “empty” most of the time, and do you feel that life
is meaningless?
 Has your energy decreased lately? Do you feel tired most of
the time?
 Do you no longer find pleasure in activities you used to enjoy,
including sex?
 Have you been experiencing sleep disturbances? Is it hard for
you to sleep? Do you wake up in the middle of the night or
early in the morning? Do you oversleep?
 Have you recently lost or gained a lot of weight? Have you lost
your appetite? Do you overeat?
 Do you suffer from feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or help-
lessness?
 Have you been feeling more irritable than usual?
 Do you cry frequently?
 Do you have chronic aches and pains that don’t respond to
medical treatment?
 Do you have thoughts of death or suicide? Have you made any
suicide attempts?
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
174

If you answer yes to the last question, immediately call 911, a sui-
cide prevention hotline (whose number should be in the yellow
pages), or your company’s confidential employee assistance pro-
gram. You also need to call if you think that someone else is con-
sidering suicide.
In addition, you may have difficulty remembering, concentrating,
or making decisions. You may engage in destructive self-criticism
or experience low self-esteem, and you may abuse drugs or alco-
hol. Bear in mind that these are all hallmarks of low blood sugar.
Many unwitting sufferers become substance addicts in an uncon-
scious effort to medicate themselves.
If you’ve had five or more of these symptoms for two weeks or
longer, you may be suffering from depression. You owe it to your-
self to seek professional help.
Knowing What (Gray) Matters
The brain is that gray matter people so-matter-of-factly take for
granted. Brain cells, or neurons, communicate by releasing a chem-
ical called a neurotransmitter. To put it simply, your moods change
in response to the fluctuating levels of these neurotransmitters.
A deficiency or imbalance in any of these transmitters can cause
problems such as depression, sleeplessness, and irritability. It’s
Chapter 10: Defanging the Depression Demons 175
But how does sugar make you feel?
People often show affection and reward others by offering sugary treats. In most
Western cultures (and other cultures, as well), sugar has become its own reward
system. People have become conditioned to crave gooey desserts. As a result, so
many emotional issues (not to mention excess weight) revolve around excess sugar
consumption.
Sugar, therefore, can become a compulsive habit. For some, it becomes a true
addiction. (To read more about sugar and addiction, flip to Chapter 2.) You know if
you’re an addict. Your friends may be able to eat a few cookies and leave the rest;
get a few scoops of ice cream without devouring the entire tub; or eat just one
square of a chocolate bar. But you? If you’re a sugar junkie, you know what you do.
And it’s not pretty. If you’re addicted to sugar, you may need to completely abstain
from the substance, at least temporarily, to free yourself from your addiction. No
matter what’s causing your craving for sugar, you may be able to meet it by eating
fruits or an occasional natural dessert made without refined sugar.

believed that a deficiency or imbalance of these neurotransmitters
is the underlying cause of depression. As you can see from Table
10-1, many neurotransmitters perform various functions.

Getting Comfy on the Couch
Are you troubled, stressed, or depressed? If so, you may benefit
from psychotherapy — therapy of the mind and emotions.
Psychotherapists, professionals who administer psychotherapy, can
help you find healthier ways to relate to others and unlearn behav-
ior that leads to unwanted consequences.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy

Would you like some yin with your coffee?
From the point of view of traditional Chinese medicine, the desire for sweet flavor
is seen as a craving for comfort and security, and a longing for the mother, which is
a yin energy. Yin represents dark, female, cold, the earth, and so on. Its opposite,
yang, is regarded as light, male, warm, and heaven. The stressful urban setting is
seen as having a yang energy, and city dwellers may unconsciously seek to bal-
ance the excessive yang by turning to sweets and starches, which are yin.

If your depression is mainly a result of blood sugar imbalance, you
may find that no amount of talk therapy can keep the beast at bay
until the underlying disorder is corrected. So don’t use therapy as
an excuse to shirk your diet. A healthy diet and therapy work
hand-in-hand. Even if you choose not to see a therapist today, a
plethora of self-help techniques can help you deal with mood dis-
orders. Meditation, relaxation and progressive techniques, stress-
management, and self-hypnosis mean that you’ll never be bored.
See Chapter 9 for more information about these subjects.
If you do want to tackle bad habits that stem from hypoglycemia’s
physical causes (such as sugar addiction), or if you just want to
get yourself out of that funky depression (such as the one making
you cry every other day), therapy may benefit you. To pick a good
therapist, refer to Chapter 4; the suggestions for hooking up with
the right doctor apply to therapists, as well.
This section sheds some light on what therapy can do to battle
your depression. This section also explains how a therapist can
help you start thinking in a healthy manner.
Mastering new thinking skills
After years of suffering from low blood sugar, you or your loved
one may have fallen into the habit of distorted, negative thinking.
You may worry too much, anticipate the worst, discount your
achievements, get offended easily, and so on. You may feel as
though you have no control over your feelings.
The good news is that anyone can discover how to replace damaging
thoughts with more positive and realistic thoughts. When you tackle
these counterproductive thoughts, it becomes easier to choose a
lifestyle that supports your goals of maximum health and happiness.
What can therapists do for you to help you battle your depression?
They can:
 Teach you new ways of thinking and of looking at things by
questioning your assumptions and pointing out the thoughts
that lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, or other nega-
tives. If you’re like most people, you have a tendency to believe
all your thoughts. In other words, you accept your beliefs as
self-evident truths — when in fact, they’re nothing more than
assumptions that you’ve made about yourself or your life. For
example, if you’re depressed, you may tell yourself, “It’s just the
way things are; my symptoms are here to stay.” “Learning how
to eat a hypoglycemically correct diet is too daunting a task. I
can never do it.” These are unquestioned assumptions that can
Chapter 10: Defanging the Depression Demons 177

keep you from recovering from your health condition — or
attaining any other cherished desires.
 Help you regain control over your feelings by teaching you
how to define and set goals, and how to take small, incre-
mental steps toward achieving them. After you discover how
to break your goals into small steps, you’ll find it easier to
make steady progress.
 Help you deal better with hypoglycemic symptoms and tol-
erate the physical aches that are hypoglycemia’s hallmark.
At the same time, therapy can teach you to become more con-
sistent at treating the disorder (for instance, by eating better
and learning to incorporate exercise into your life). Ups and
downs are inevitable while you’re transitioning to a healthier
lifestyle, and the support of a good therapist can be indispen-
sable. Psychology For Dummies, by Adam Cash, PsyD (Wiley),
discusses the various types of therapy and takes on tough
therapy topics. Read it for more in-depth information.
If you don’t want to see a therapist, you may want to start with
self-help books. Books on changing your cognitive patterns can also
be very helpful. Negative patterns of thinking feed depression. For
instance, if you persistently think, “I’m a failure. There’s nothing I
can do to help myself,” you’re bound to feel helpless and hopeless.
When you change these negative, habitual ways of thinking, you lift
your mood. This is a useful therapy to try if you’ve been living with
hypoglycemia and all its distorted thinking. Check out your local
library or bookstore for good titles on the subject. Get books that
guide you through changing your negative thoughts, step by step,
and provide concrete examples.
Thinking healthy
According to a controlled study by the University of Pennsylvania,
people who maintain optimistic attitudes not only avoid depres-
sion but also improve their physical health. When students were
taught cognitive coping skills, they reported fewer physical prob-
lems. In other words, they replaced self-defeating thoughts (“I’m
too stupid to get good grades”) with more positive ones (“I’m intel-
ligent and can get good grades if I apply myself”).
Similar coping skills can be applied to hypoglycemia. For instance,
you may find yourself thinking, “How come everyone else gets to
have fun eating whatever, while I have to restrict my diet? And I’m
not even noticing any improvement.” Not only are these thoughts
negative, they’re generally not even true. These are all examples of
distorted thinking. Some reflection will tell you that these thoughts
don’t accurately describe reality. They’re unhelpful and can keep
you stuck in unhealthy patterns of behavior.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
178

You can discover how to challenge your thoughts and identify
what’s irrational or unhelpful about them. When you spot the dis-
tortions, replace them with more realistic and more positive alter-
native thoughts. “If it’s fun I want, there’s lots I can do. Besides, I’m
getting fewer headaches, and my mood swings aren’t as severe.
Even though I miss my favorite foods, becoming healthier is worth
giving up bad habits.” From this example, you can see how easily
you can discourage — or encourage — yourself.
Like any new skill, it may take you awhile to get the hang of replac-
ing negative thoughts with positive thoughts. You wouldn’t expect
to win a black belt overnight if you were learning judo. Be just as
patient with yourself when you’re learning to think healthy.
You also have the option of finding a psychotherapist trained in cog-
nitive therapy or cognitive behavior therapy to help you if you find
yourself struggling to master these new skills. The therapist can
help you recognize destructive patterns of thinking and reacting,
and then provide you with tools to help you modify or correct these
errors.
Easing through the transition
When you’ve tackled counterproductive thoughts, it’s easier to
choose a lifestyle that supports your goals. A faulty body chem-
istry makes it difficult to make rational choices. If your battle with
blood sugar imbalance has left you tired and weary, you can regain
control by learning how to define and set goals and take small,
Chapter 10: Defanging the Depression Demons 179
Does your life coach wear a whistle?
One alternative to therapy is to hire a life coach. A life coach acts like a personal
trainer for your life. Athletes have coaches who train, motivate, and help them per-
form, so why shouldn’t you have a coach to assist you in designing and creating a
better life? Life coaches can help you set goals, teach you necessary skills, and
keep you on track. Consultations are available in person, by phone, or by e-mail.
Just as with therapists, you need to carefully screen potential coaches. Because life
coaches aren’t required to undergo as rigorous a training program as psychother-
apists, you need to be extra careful that you hire a person of integrity who can effec-
tively guide you. Personal recommendations are probably the best.
Bear in mind that although coaches are supposed to honor confidentiality, they have
no medical training, and they can’t prescribe meds. Like sports coaches, they’re
good at motivating clients, but if you’re currently suffering from depression, they’ll
be the first ones to tell you to see a licensed psychotherapist.

incremental steps toward achieving them. If you don’t know how to
do this, read a book, take a course in goal-setting, or find a thera-
pist who can help you define your goals.
Transitions can be difficult. One big plus about going on a recovery
program for low blood sugar is that you start feeling so much
better, and hence you’re motivated to keep going. Of course, you
may have setbacks and plateaus (when things stay the same and
nothing seems to be happening), but if you honestly follow the
food and exercise program, your symptoms will start disappearing,
and you’ll feel healthier.
This is where competent therapists can play a vital role. They teach
you cognitive skills that you can use to address your transition. Also,
you’ll regain a sense of optimism knowing that you’re tackling your
problem head-on with a compassionate professional on your side.
Beating the Low Blood Sugar Blues
The best way out of the low blood sugar blues is simple — right
through your mouth. (We don’t mean singing, but you can try that,
too.) You can eat your way to hell or health, your choice. If you
truly want to beat the blues, start by looking at how your diet
affects your mood when you have hypoglycemia. You can then
make the necessary dietary changes to help battle the blues.
(Chapter 6 focuses on actual dietary changes; this section focuses
on the relationship of your diet and depression and how you can
overcome that depression.)
Stop being so SAD
The sort of food that most Americans — and increasingly, the rest of
the world — consume is called SAD (Standard American Diet) for a
good reason. Stick with it long enough and you’re likely to start feel-
ing sad and depressed. Why? The diet consists of too much refined
sugar and refined flour, has tons of hydrogenated oil and other bad
oils, and is high in calories and low in nutrients. Now, if that doesn’t
depress you, what would! If scientists went to their labs to deliber-
ately cook up (no pun intended) a diet designed to cause blood
sugar imbalance, they couldn’t come up with a better — or rather,
worse — diet than this one.
Sadly, SAD appears to have ignited an epidemic of diabetes in the
United States — and the rest of the world is following America’s
sad lead. Today, more than 20 million adults and children in the
United States have diabetes.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
180

So how does this relate to hypoglycemia? Oddly enough, chronic
problems with low blood sugar can lead to its opposite — high
blood sugar, or type 2 diabetes. (Check out Chapter 3 for more
info.) The underlying cause of both type 2 diabetes and hypo-
glycemia is poor nutrition. Poor diet leads to blood sugar imbal-
ances. Unbalanced blood sugar can ravage your health and cause
depression. (Check out Chapter 6 for ways to improve your diet.)
By some estimates, the incidence of major depression has increased
tenfold since a decade ago. That’s not too surprising, considering
that there seems to be a hidden link between diabetes and depres-
sion. If you consider that one of the symptoms of hypoglycemia is
depression, you can see how some depressed people may be prone
to developing diabetes. It also makes sense that individuals suffering
from a chronic disease like diabetes would have a tendency to
become depressed. Research suggests that diabetes increases the
risk of depression, and depression increases the risk of diabetes. It’s
not quite clear which comes first, diabetes or depression. But it
really doesn’t matter which comes first. What doctors are most
concerned about is that depression interferes with an individual’s
problem-solving ability and therefore his ability to manage diabetes.
Taking a swing at your mood
The same drugs that treat clinical depression can also help with
mood swings, one of the key symptoms of hypoglycemia. When
your blood sugar is erratic — rising fast in response to eating, and
then dropping too low shortly after — your moods are likely to
swing wildly too. Antidepressants may work to stabilize your
mood. (Check out the section “Feeling Out Antidepressants” for
more info.) But each individual is different, and a drug that works
for one person may not necessarily work for another.
A more natural approach using herbs and supplements may work
just as well as antidepressants, and without their side effects.
(Chapter 7 tells you more about this subject.) Because each
person’s biochemistry is different, try to find a healthcare provider
knowledgeable about hypoglycemia and depression to give you
suggestions.
So many factors are involved in depression that it’s too simplistic
to say that poor diet is its only cause. Nonetheless, evidence has
been mounting that depression and mood swings are linked to vita-
min and mineral deficiencies. The following can help you keep
your mood from swinging:
 Obtain more Omega-3 fatty acids. Good food sources are wal-
nuts, flaxseed, and oily fish like salmon. But if you’re fighting
Chapter 10: Defanging the Depression Demons 181

depression, start out by taking Omega-3 supplements in the
form of fish oil capsules. (For resources on high-quality sup-
plements, flip to Chapter 7.)
Here’s an added bonus: Unlike antidepressants that often lead
to decreased sex drive or the inability to experience orgasms,
Omega-3s appear to help boost sex drive.
 Get more folic acid. Cabbage is rich in folic acid — or folate,
when it occurs naturally in foods. It also has vitamin C and
lots of fiber, which slows down digestion and stabilizes blood
sugar. You can also take folic acid supplements.
 Get plenty of natural sunlight. Doing so can also help offset
mood swings. If you live in an area without adequate sun-
shine, try full-spectrum light bulbs in your house.
 Stay away from caffeine and tobacco smoke. Both sub-
stances contribute to blood sugar imbalance.
 Know about potential prescription drug side effects. Some
prescription medication, such as amphetamines, pain killers,
anticonvulsants, high blood pressure drugs, and so forth, can
also contribute to depression. But don’t quit taking them or
cut back on the dosage by yourself. Go talk to your doctor
and see whether he can recommend alternative approaches.
Discussing dietary plans
No matter what you do, if hypoglycemia is the root cause of your
depression or cravings, you have to change your diet — no way
around that! It doesn’t matter if you try talk therapy; over the long
haul, not much can change unless you revamp your diet.
For instance, a woman in her 40s sought help from various thera-
pists because she’d suffered from depression all her life. The thera-
pists were able to help clear up many long-standing problems, but
the depression didn’t budge. Finally, they discovered that she had
low blood sugar. When she changed her eating habits, her dark
moods promptly went away.
For quick help in balancing your blood sugar, try some of these tips:
 Replace simple carbs like white bread and white rice with
complex starches. For instance, brown rice has the following:
• More complex molecules that take longer for the body to
digest (helping you avoid the sugar-insulin spike).
• Vitamins B1, B3, and folic acid to help prevent mood
swings.

Going online to fight your depression
Are you battling some depression or anxiety? Do you feel blue or down in the
dumps? If you’re looking for additional help to deal with your depression and hypo-
glycemia, check out the following Web sites:
 All of Depression (www.allofdepression.com): This comprehensive Web
site offers a directory, articles, and resources on depression.
 The Anxiety & Hypoglycemia Relief Institute: This group was founded by
Professor J.H. Levitt in 1994. The group’s purpose is to help educate people
about the most common causes of biochemical imbalance. For questions
regarding anxiety and hypoglycemia and New York City classes, contact Prof.
Levitt at 212-479-7805 (voice mail) or jlevitt@pratt.edu (e-mail).
 Health Recovery Center (www.healthrecovery.com): This center was
founded in 1980 by Joan Matthews Larson, PhD, author of Seven Weeks to
Sobriety. Larson’s article explains the link between hypoglycemia and alcoholism.
This site provides comprehensive information about alcoholism, depression, and
anxiety, and biochemical solutions to overcome them. It offers nutritional sup-
plements suggested in her books, including a hypoglycemia formula. To contact
this organization, phone 800-554-9155 or e-mail hrc@healthrecovery.com.
 International Guide to the World of Alternative Mental Health (www.
alternativementalhealth.com):
This site advocates non-drug
approaches to mental health on the premise that underlying much of what are
commonly regarded as mental disorders are allergies, nutritional imbalances,
poor diets, lack of exercise, and other treatable physical conditions. It offers
more than 100 articles, testimonials, a comprehensive directory of alternative
mental health practitioners, support groups, e-mail lists, a free monthly newslet-
ter, and a bookstore.
 Eat whole grains like kamut, spelt, and quinoa, which con-
tain nutrients beneficial to the brain. Kamut contains more
protein and amino acids than common wheat. Spelt has more
vitamins B1 and B2 than other grains, and is also rich in mag-
nesium and iron. Quinoa provides complete protein because it
contains all eight essential amino aids. It’s considered the
best source of protein in the vegetable kingdom.
 Plan healthy snacks. Brazil nuts are easy to carry around
when you’re on the move and need a quick snack. Aside 
from being tasty, they’re high in selenium, which may help in
counteracting depression.
Some of the older antidepressants can increase sugar cravings, 
so tell your doctor that you need to avoid sweets. The newer anti-
depressant drugs don’t have this side effect.

Feeling Out Antidepressants
The hypoglycemic diet is your first and best line of offense for low
blood sugar. (Chapter 6 starts you on that journey.) Exercise, dis-
cussed in Chapter 8, is your next best bet. Following that, your
mental health is the place to focus.
Serotonin deficiency, a condition where the brain isn’t producing
enough of the neurotransmitter serotonin, responsible for feelings
of well-being, is correlated with depression, low self-esteem, sleep
problems, worry, and irritability. A wide range of medications
called antidepressants are used to treat clinical depression. These
meds have varying effects on serotonin, norepinephrine, and
dopamine. These same drugs help not only with depression but
also with mood swings and some obsessive-compulsive disorders.
If your dark moods are caused by underlying metabolic disorders,
antidepressants can generally work to stabilize your moods until you
start making progress with your new food plan. You should be aware
that when it comes to hypoglycemia, medication is not a substitute
for the correct diet. Taking antidepressants without treating the
underlying disorder that causes it is like banging your head against
the wall while taking pain medication to relieve the headache. Sure,
the drug will help, but shouldn’t you stop hitting yourself?
This section takes a closer look at the different antidepressants
available today and important pointers you need to remember if
you’re considering taking antidepressants.
Identifying the different drugs
Your psychiatrist can determine whether your depression may
benefit from antidepressants, as well as the type of medication and
dosage you need. (Psychologists aren’t licensed to prescribe med-
ications, so if you’re seeing such a doctor, she may team up with a
psychiatrist to make sure that you get the prescription you need.)
Table 10-2 lists some common antidepressants. New drugs are con-
tinually developed and tested; your doctor can give you the latest
information.

Bear in mind that relief may not come immediately. You may get
lucky and, right off the bat, find what works for you. If not, you may
need to go through a trial-and-error period before settling on the
right medication and dosage. This process may take a month or
longer. (To view a complete list of antidepressants, go to
www.fda.gov/cder/drug/antidepressants/MDD_all-
druglist.pdf.)
Mixing and matching clothes is fun, but you definitely don’t want
to recklessly combine drugs. Drugs and herbs can have serious
interactions with other medications. Tell your doctor about any-
thing you’re taking, including vitamins, herbs, and supplements.
Remember: Combination lunches may be an option in Chinese
restaurants, but don’t combine prescriptions without asking your
doctor! As an example, avoid taking SSRI antidepressants (such as
Prozac and Effexor) if you’re also taking drugs for migraine
headaches known as 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agnoists (trip-
tans). Taking these medicines together can sometimes result in
serotonin syndrome, a condition leading to serious changes in the
workings of your brain, muscles, and digestive system that can
sometimes be fatal.
Considering antidepressants?
Know both sides of the story
Although pharmaceutical companies heavily promote antidepres-
sants, these drugs have multiple side effects, and the long-term
effects on the brain and body haven’t yet been fully evaluated. It’s
too soon to say with certainty that the most popular psychotropic
drugs (drugs that act on your mind) on the market today are com-
pletely safe over the long haul. A debate has been raging over the
safety and efficacy of these drugs.
The good
Never take any drugs for trivial reasons. Thousands of people have
tried antidepressants without major side effects when taken as pre-
scribed. Many report that the medication has helped lift them out
of their melancholy and given them a new lease on life. One patient
compared antidepressants to “a splint for a broken spirit,” while
another likened them to wings that allowed her to fly.
Even if you get so chummy with your family physician that you
lose all respect for the poor doc, you should never, ever lose
respect for antidepressants. They must be treated with caution, if
not reverence. Be careful about the dosage; don’t forget to take
them (that can sometimes throw you off balance), and never take
more than prescribed.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
186

The bad
Before you make any decision to take or not to take antidepres-
sants, make sure that you’re fully aware of the potential risks that
exist with the use of any medication, particularly those as potent
as antidepressants.
Critics charge that many popular antidepressants are unsafe, inef-
fective, or both. Furthermore, they’re associated with side effects
that may range from merely uncomfortable to highly dangerous,
sometimes even lethal. For example, Wellbutrin (bupropion) can
trigger seizures in some patients.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a Public
Health Advisory on the use of popular antidepressants by children
and adults. Some patients, particularly children, experience
increased depression and suicidal thoughts after taking antidepres-
sants. Therefore, both adults and children should be closely moni-
tored, especially at the beginning of treatment, or when the doses
are either increased or decreased.
The FDA also cautions that both adults and children taking anti-
depressants can develop side effects, including anxiety, agitation,
panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, impulsivity, akathisia
(severe restlessness), hypomania, and mania. The antidepressants
in question include Prozac (fluoxetine); Zoloft (sertraline); Paxil
(paroxetine); Luvox (fluvoxamine); Celexa (citalopram); Lexapro
(escitalopram); Wellbutrin (bupropion); Effexor (venlafaxine);
Serzone (nefazodone); and Remeron (mirtazapine).
But wait, that’s not all. Another, lesser known side effect is tardive
dyskinesia, a medication-induced tic disorder. It most often shows
up as involuntary movements usually affecting the mouth, lips and
tongue. The tics may be quite disfiguring.
Working with a psychiatrist
If you want medical treatment for depression, we recommend seek-
ing out psychiatrists. Currently, some 70 percent of antidepressant
prescriptions are written out by general practitioners, but they
aren’t always as familiar or as up-to-date on antidepressants as
they should be. Besides, a reputable psychiatrist monitors her
patients closely for any warning symptoms and is more likely to
spot those warnings accurately than doctors who are more familiar
with physical ailments.
Chapter 10: Defanging the Depression Demons 187

Even if you don’t see a psychiatrist, if you suffer from depression,
seek help! Depression, with or without hypoglycemia, is an illness,
not a moral weakness. There’s absolutely no reason for anyone
today to suffer from the debilitating illness of depression without
seeking help.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
188
So you think you’re in a rat race . . .
In a study published by the American Psychological Association, Rod K. Dishman,
MD, of the University of Georgia used rats to compare exercise to the antidepres-
sant drug imipramine. First, he induced a depression-like condition in these rats by
using the drug clomipramine. Then he gave one group of rats 24-hour access to a
running-wheel for 12 weeks. Another group ran on a treadmill for an hour a day, six
days a week, for 12 weeks. A third group received imipramine for the last six days
of the experiment, and a fourth group received no treatment or exercise.
Dr. Dishman determined whether the rats experienced an improvement in depres-
sion by detecting an increase in brain concentration of norepinephrine and sero-
tonin metabolism, and an increase in sexual activity. The rats given imipramine and
both exercise groups showed the telltale changes in the balance of neurotransmit-
ters. But only the wheel-running rats showed both an improvement in their mood
and an increase in sexual activity.
The moral? Exercise is good; exercise that’s not forced is even better. (How’s your
sex life, by the way?)

 Dealing with long workdays
 Handling stressors at work
H
aving a metabolic disorder such as hypoglycemia doesn’t
have to unduly complicate your life. With just a few adjust-
ments and modifications, you can circumvent any potential prob-
lems that hypoglycemia may pose in your work life. Taking control
over hypoglycemia is all about planning and management.
Make your health a priority. You may think that putting your work
first is virtuous and will help you get ahead, but in the long run,
you’re only sabotaging yourself with health problems.
To better manage your health, you may need to let co-workers
know about your health challenges. (This doesn’t mean coming
across as a hypochondriac or someone who’s using health issues
as an excuse to get special treatment.) This chapter shows you
how to inform others of your health concerns in a professional,
respectful manner that doesn’t undermine your credibility.
We also address the issue of work stress in this chapter. No matter
what type of work you do, you’re bound to be confronted with
stressors, making it that much more difficult to deal with your
hypoglycemic symptoms. By taking proactive steps to deal with
workday stress, you can ease the symptoms and smooth out
potential problems. (For hints on dealing with other stress, flip to
Chapter 9.)

No Rings around Either: Blue
and White Collar Workers
Because so many different jobs are out there, we can’t cover every
angle of dealing with hypoglycemia at work. (For work-related legal
matters, see “Flying with the legal eagles,” later in this chapter.)
Whatever your field, whatever your collar color, all jobs offer dif-
ferent challenges, so we can offer only generalities. Only you know
the special circumstances and the particulars of your job. It
shouldn’t be that difficult to accommodate your needs, no matter
where you work.

Bad work habits don’t just include
surfing the Internet
Do you catch yourself working so hard that when you look at the clock you realize
that you missed lunch? You may be committed to your job, but when you have hypo-
glycemia, you need to make sure you take time for yourself at work.
Here are some things that will stress you out; unbalance you physically, mentally,
and emotionally; and ultimately lead to problems with blood sugar regulation:
 Skipping breakfast
 Skipping lunch (If you miss breakfast and/or lunch, you won’t be able to work
efficiently.)
 Shoveling food into your mouth
 Not taking enough breaks
 Continuing to work when exhausted
 Staying up late to finish the day’s work
 Being a perfectionist
 Making negative comments to yourself, like “No one appreciates the work I do.”
 Failing to communicate with colleagues
 Not trusting others to do their share of the work
 Needing to validate your self-worth through work
 Not asking for help when you need it
 Refusing to acknowledge that hypoglycemia is a problem that needs to be
treated
To discover how to better manage yourself, turn to Chapters 9 and 16.

Hard hat area
If you engage in physical labor, you have to be especially careful
about your blood sugar level. Symptoms such as tremors of the
hand, dizziness, and weakness can jeopardize your safety.
Other general rules for hard hat workers include the following:
 Eat something every two hours. This schedule helps you
maintain a constant blood sugar level.
 Get enough calories. Your body needs enough calories to
function properly. If you’re on a weight-reduction diet, you can
decrease your calorie intake a bit, but don’t overdo it. Eating
frequently helps stave off hunger and makes it easier to lose
weight.
 Consider adding more carbohydrates to your diet.
Depending on how vigorous your work is, you may want to eat
a lot more carbs. Consuming roughly 40 percent of your calo-
ries in carbohydrates is normally recommended for hypo-
glycemics. But if you engage in a great deal of physical labor,
you can consume up to 60 percent of your calories in carbs.
(Chapter 6 tells you more about percentages and portions.)
Start with a small increase in the amount of carbs you eat, and
then gradually increase the amount to see how it makes you
feel. If the increase triggers more hypoglycemic symptoms
and carbohydrate cravings, cut back.
 Eat only high-quality carbs, such as non-starchy veggies,
fruits, and whole grains. If you’re one of the many hypo-
glycemics who can’t handle whole grains, eliminate them from
your diet regardless of how many calories you burn.
 Limit bread to one slice a day, and eat more grains, such as
millet and quinoa. See Chapter 6 for info about healthy foods.
 Carry snacks with you wherever you go. Never, ever go any-
where without food.
Tie required
If you work regular hours in an office, you should be able to eat
every two to two-and-a-half hours during breaks and lunch. If your
break times aren’t regular, and you often forget to take them because
you’re concentrating on your work, it may be a good idea to
 Set a wristwatch with multiple alarms.
Chapter 11: Making It through Your Day at Work 191

 Have a family member or an answering service call you at pre-
arranged times.
 Make signs for your desk to remind you to eat.
Addressing Your Boss 
and Co-Workers
Where are you in terms of work? Are you barely holding your own?
Is your work record so spotty that you may be fired? Do you have
excessive absenteeism due to your health condition? Or, are you in
pretty good shape, just needing a little bit of help from your col-
leagues to function better?
Depending on your job and your relationship with your superiors,
you may be hesitant to approach them with what appears to be a
personal problem. You may be especially concerned if your com-
pany’s corporate culture is cutthroat, and any shortcomings on
your part, real or imagined, can be used as ammunition against you.
On the other hand, if your health is impacting your work perform-
ance, it’s not just your problem. You need to work out a solution.
No need to worry though. This section can help you talk to your
boss and co-workers. However, depending on your own circum-
stances, you may be better off not telling your boss the whole
story. This section shows you how to walk that fine line.
Knowing when (and how) to tell
your boss and co-workers
If your hypoglycemia is affecting your work and work relation-
ships, you may have already considered telling your boss and co-
workers why you’re taking extra time off or why you’re struggling
to stay focused in the afternoon.
You may want to discuss matters with Human Resources (HR)
before approaching your boss, because HR usually has to clear any
special arrangements. Of course, if you have a wonderful rapport
with your boss, you may want to go to her first; it helps to have
someone on your side.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
192

How do you know whether now is the best time? Discuss the
matter if you
 Work somewhere with a policy against eating at your desk,
and you can’t get away to a breakroom for a snack
 Need extra breaks
 Frequently travel for your job
 Are expected to put in long hours
 Often call in sick
 Have been unable to concentrate, and your performance has
suffered
Remember that you have certain rights, and if your health is a
matter that needs to be discussed, by all means, do so. You may
have more credibility if you get a diagnosis from a medical doctor or
other healthcare practitioner before coming out as a hypoglycemic.
Knowing when not to tell
If your condition isn’t very severe, and it hasn’t impacted your
work, then perhaps you don’t need to mention it to your supervi-
sor. Consider all your options and your particular situation. You
know where you are in the corporate hierarchy (assuming that you
work for a corporation) and what your corporate culture is like. If
it’s a nice, cozy, family-like atmosphere, you may have little to
worry about, although there are fewer work places like that today.
If you don’t feel comfortable or if your hypoglycemia isn’t impact-
ing your job performance, you don’t need to disclose anything to
your boss or co-workers. However, if your place of employment
has sticky rules about, for example, eating at your desk or work
space, you may be able to gently ask your supervisor for special
permission because of a health issue if you need to eat more often.
Even if you decide not to tell your boss or co-workers about your
condition, find at least one ally at work who is caring, trustworthy,
and dependable. Perhaps you can ask this person to help you
during times when your symptoms flare and you need some extra
help coping. When you’re in pain or suffering from brain fog and
can’t trust yourself to eat regularly, you may ask this person to help
you remember to eat at predetermined intervals until your condi-
tion improves. As an adult, asking someone to remind you to eat
Chapter 11: Making It through Your Day at Work 193

may seem weird. You’re not in kindergarten, after all! But the point
is that when your brain isn’t getting its fuel, your thinking function
starts to shut down. When your thinking shuts down, you probably
aren’t going to remember when you have to eat. Explain the physi-
cal condition that you have; emphasize that it won’t be a perma-
nent arrangement. When your condition stabilizes, you’ll be in good
enough shape that you won’t need these constant reminders.
Flying with the legal eagles
If you decide to tell your supervisor that you’re hypoglycemic, first
consider becoming familiar with your rights as an employee, espe-
cially as they pertain to your health. The Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) protects your rights as an employee if you’re
“a qualified individual with disabilities.” Who falls under this cate-
gory? Anyone with a physical or mental impairment that substan-
tially limits one or more major life activities, such as seeing,
hearing, speaking, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks,
learning, caring for oneself, and working. These disabilities include
such conditions as epilepsy, paralysis, HIV infection, and diabetes.
Sprains, broken limbs, or the flu won’t cut it.
In other words, even if you tell your employer that you have hypo-
glycemia or a related condition, he can’t fire you on the basis of
that alone. You have the right to ask your employer for any reason-
able accommodations you need to perform the duties assigned to
you. Of course, what’s reasonable is open to interpretation, but if
both parties are acting in good faith, you should be able to work
out an arrangement that’s satisfactory for everyone concerned.
To protect yourself, follow these steps:
1. Get a letter or memo, preferably from a medical doctor,
explaining your illness.
If you can’t get the note from a doctor, get it from another
health practitioner. Ask for a written diagnosis and medical
recommendations. At the very least, try to obtain a written
description of your condition for your employer’s benefit.
Go to someone who’s familiar with your symptoms and can
confirm the dates you suffered and the specific symptoms.
2. Ask to speak to your supervisor about your condition 
privately.
If the situation warrants it, you may want to wait until the
end of the workday to discuss the matter. Be forthright
about your physical condition, because your supervisor
needs to be aware of your symptoms.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
194

3. Keep a written record of any communication between
yourself and management, including the date(s) of your
meeting with your supervisor and what you talked about.
You may need to prove that you did your best to work
things out, so creating a paper trail is important. Don’t
announce that you’re keeping a file, however. If the meeting
with your supervisor doesn’t go well, don’t discuss it with
anyone else in the office, because people may think that
you’re complaining about management. You don’t want to
appear to be antagonistic.
If things get out of hand to the point that you receive disciplinary
action, you can ask to see what’s in your file. Finding out the con-
tent of your file is important so that you can figure out what to do.
If the information is accurate, try to correct any work problems
that have been pointed out. If the information is inaccurate, find a
way to correct it. Check with your union steward (if you have one)
to see how you can do this. If you aren’t in a union, bring up the
matter with your direct supervisor, HR rep, or whoever handles
such matters.
Finding practical solutions
Before you approach your boss, make a list of the topics you want
to discuss and the specific requests you’re making. Prepare alter-
natives for whatever requests you’re making.
Bring the supervisor into the process of finding solutions. Be open
to her suggestions, but don’t put the onus on her to come up with
ideas. Make it clear that you’re on the same side, trying to find
ways to help you be as productive as possible at work.
Some practical solutions to help you cope with hypoglycemia at
work include the following:
 Offer general information about hypoglycemia’s symptoms
and how you can prevent them. An understanding of the con-
dition and the possible need for regular work schedules and
meal breaks is usually helpful and appreciated.
 Keep a progress report for yourself. That way, if necessary,
you can point out that you’re following through on your com-
mitment to work things out responsibly.
 Talk privately to co-workers who you may have offended
with your mood swings or temper outbursts. Offer them a
sincere apology and tell them what low blood sugar can do to
one’s brain. It may take a little time, but after you show that
you’re getting more stable, they may be ready to trust you.
Chapter 11: Making It through Your Day at Work 195

 Eat a small snack before meetings so that you don’t have a
sudden blood sugar dip. Even with such precautions, people
with a blood sugar imbalance may feel fine one minute and
then, suddenly, without warning, feel faint or weak the next. If
you’re prone to such attacks, bring something to drink with
you, such as milk or unsweetened soy milk. These drinks
should be enough to forestall a hypoglycemic incident. If you
still have problems, ask your supervisor whether you can
leave briefly to get a snack.
Framing your condition positively
If you decide the best course of action is to tell your boss and you’re
ready to talk to him, make sure you plan the discussion and exactly
what you’re going to say. Come prepared with documentation from
your medical provider.
When speaking to your supervisor or management about your con-
dition, follow these simple guidelines:
 Be honest. Simply state that hypoglycemia is a condition
that’s related to diabetes, and that you’ve been advised that it
may progress into diabetes if you don’t treat it properly.
Therefore, you’re acting in a responsible manner by taking
whatever measures are necessary to prevent your condition
from becoming more of a problem.
One caveat: Don’t feel compelled to give a blow-by-blow
account of every pain and ache you have. Keep the discussion
brief and to the point.
 Apologize immediately for any problems or inconveniences
that your symptoms may have caused. Your tone should be
one of taking responsibility, not of self-pity or complaint. You
don’t want to make yourself sound like a hopeless invalid.
 Accept input about where you may have fallen short in your
work performance as a result of your physical condition. If
your boss gives no such input, simply point out things you’ll
do to make sure that your work improves.
 Don’t dwell on the problem. Whatever your challenges, rumi-
nating on them will only make you feel worse. You’re more
likely to come up with creative solutions if you take a break
from thinking about your problem.
 Focus on the positives, not the negatives. Because you have
become more knowledgeable about your condition and are
participating in a healthy lifestyle, you can be even more
productive than other employees. To effectively live with
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
196

hypoglycemia, you have to be self-disciplined, self-aware, and
self-responsible — all of which are invaluable characteristics
that companies look for in their employees.
 Emphasize that you know what the problem is and you’re
getting a handle on it. When you learn to control the prob-
lem, your condition will stabilize, and you’ll fulfill the essential
tasks of your employment position.
If you frame requests in a positive way, you’re more likely to be
heard. At the least, a positive attitude can keep any discussions
from turning ugly. Keep in mind that your employer hired you to
carry out a specific job; you have an obligation and responsibility
to fulfill your duties to the best of your ability.
Putting Up a Cot in the Cubicle?
Managing Long Work Hours
Do you work more than 40 hours a week? Surveys show that a
rising number of people in the United States are clocking in a
record number of hours at work. It’s not uncommon for people to
put in 18 to 20 hours a day. In fact, Americans are putting in longer
hours than most other nations, surpassing even workaholic Japan!
We’re talking about averages here, of course. Your country of resi-
dence doesn’t preclude you from working inordinately long hours.
It all depends on individual circumstances.
This section helps you understand a bit better your working style
and rhythm as well as gives you some ways to break up your work-
day so you aren’t slaving away without any reprieve.
Gettin’ in the groove with work
If you want to work efficiently, figure out your personal rhythm and
try to work in accordance with it. Different occupations have differ-
ent rhythms, tempos, and paces. If your natural rhythm isn’t in
accordance with your job’s rhythm, you’ll likely wear yourself out.
Ask yourself the following questions:
 Am I a morning person or a night owl? (Hypoglycemics tend
to do better at night, although there are exceptions.)
 Do I work better or worse under deadline pressure?
 Do I work in spurts or at an even, constant pace?
Chapter 11: Making It through Your Day at Work 197

Now, ask the following questions in relation to your work:
 Am I a team player or a lone wolf?
 Which tasks do I enjoy the most?
 Which tasks give me the most problems?
By understanding your personal style, you’ll be better able to
adapt to your working environment. You’ll not only feel healthier,
but you’ll also be able to work more effectively as well. Coping with
hypoglycemia means making lifestyle changes, which in turn
requires you to do a little soul searching.
Breaking up your work day
Do you work five hours straight without getting up to use the rest-
room or to snack on healthy food? Are you dragging and have no
energy when you need to complete the most important report of
the day? If so, taking small, frequent breaks gives you a chance to
re-fuel by eating a small snack. Doing so will increase your energy
and improve your concentration.
Consider tackling the most troublesome portion of your job when
you’re the most energetic, and reward yourself with the tasks that
you truly enjoy. If you don’t like anything about your work, make
plans to get into a different line of work. Even if you have to work
toward a distant goal, taking concrete action should make your
current circumstances easier.
You may want to incorporate the following schedule into your
workday:
 Take a mini-break every 45 to 60 minutes. (This is in addi-
tion to the official 10 to 15 minute breaks you may get.)
• Do a few neck rolls and eye rolls, and let your eyes rest
by looking out into the distance.
• Make sure that you blink frequently if you work on a
computer for most of the day. (The person who blinks
first is not the loser.)
• Do a few isometrics (exercises in which you contract cer-
tain muscles). For instance, tighten your thigh muscles
for a few seconds and then release.
• Stretch out a little every once in a while. Go to the water
cooler or the bathroom.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
198

Don’t worry, you’re not wasting time. These mini-breaks take
just a few minutes, and they make a big difference in your per-
formance and the way you feel. Your focus, concentration, and
thinking will be much sharper.
You may, at times, feel more lethargic or cloudy headed than
usual. Or you may notice an increase in the intensity of some
of your other symptoms. To help alleviate your symptoms, try
to schedule your main breaks so that you can physically lie
down for 15 minutes (or for a half an hour during lunch).
Lying down is much more restorative than sitting. If lying
down just isn’t possible, perhaps you can put your head down
on your desk and close your eyes. Even resting with your
head down on your desk can make a world of difference.
 Eat every 11⁄2 to 2 hours. This tip is especially important for
maintaining your blood sugar. You won’t lose any time. We’re
not talking a banquet here. You can snack while you’re work-
ing. Try nibbling on nuts or seeds. Or bring plain yogurt or
cottage cheese.
 Eat more protein for lunch. When you start your hypo-
glycemic diet, you may begin to notice that you don’t have
post-lunch drowsiness and mid-afternoon slumps like you
used to. If you still have problems, cut back drastically on
starches such as pasta and grains.
Preparing for those long hours when
you’re away from the office
On your days off or after a day on the job, take a moment for your-
self. Take care of your physical and emotional self in the following
ways:
 At the end of the day or on days off, allow yourself to rest
without guilt.
• Get other members of the family to do household
chores, such as cleaning or the laundry. Or hire help.
• Eat out instead of cooking at home (if you think it will
help). Just make sure that you order something within
your diet plan, such as salad, steamed vegetables, and
grilled fish or chicken.
 Work out at least three times a week but don’t overdo it.
Don’t become a weekend warrior who crams in hours of exer-
cise on days off. (Check out Chapter 8 for more on incorporat-
ing exercise into your daily routine.)
Chapter 11: Making It through Your Day at Work 199

 Ask yourself whether you really need to work all those
hours. Keep a written record of all your activities during the
day. When you review the account, you’ll be able to see where
the time wasters are, what can be eliminated or reduced, and
where you can improve efficiency. The idea is to work
smarter, not harder.
Diffusing Work-Related Stress
Work has stresses all its own — stresses different from those in
your personal life. Isn’t that nice? Here’s how you can deal with
these special stresses:
 It may sound trite, but live one day at a time. When some-
thing goes wrong at work, remind yourself that this too shall
pass. Will anyone care about it 100 years from now? Will you
care about it in a year?
 Eliminate the stressors that can be avoided, and learn to
handle everyday stress through meditation and exercise.
(See Chapter 9 for info on how to reduce stress.) Remember
that managing stress is a big part of attaining and maintaining
health.
 Go away for a mini-retreat if you can. Take an entire week-
end off where you aren’t interrupted and have time to relax,
pamper yourself, and perhaps review your work and career
goals. Where are you in your career right now? Where do you
want to be? Should you quit your current job? Play for a pro-
motion? Go into a different line of work? Go back to school?
Write your memoir? Become a mime?
 Have fun. This agenda item may not be on your radar screen
when you’re overworked, but scheduling some fun time into
every day is important, even if it’s for only 10 minutes. Have
lunch with someone you enjoy. Go window shopping. Read
the funnies. Sketch a drawing. Call a friend and shoot the
breeze. At least once a week, try to do something pleasurable
that takes a couple of hours or more. For extra enjoyment and
relaxation, get a weekly massage if you can afford it. If not,
trade massages with family or friends. It’s all about inner and
outer balance.
The following sections provide plenty of helpful pointers to sur-
vive work-related stress. First and foremost, we assist you in look-
ing inward at how your job really affects your life and health. We
also give you some ways to help you cope with a stressful job,
including staying away from caffeine and making your home away
from home a little cozier.

Evaluating your life: Does this job
impede your health?
If your work is seriously detracting from your quality of life and
contributing to your poor health, take this opportunity to do a
major life review. If you’re in poor health, or if you’re having a con-
stellation of symptoms (maybe even a galaxy of them), something’s
not right, whether it’s physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual.
Your body’s metabolic imbalance may be a reflection of an imbal-
ance in your life. To become completely well, you’re going to have
to address your health in a multi-faceted way, physically, mentally,
emotionally, and spiritually. Work occupies most of your waking
time; how healthy can you become if your job is a source of major
dissatisfaction? The stress of doing work you’re not suited for can
only exacerbate your hypoglycemia.
Postpone making any major decisions until you have your diet
under control and your symptoms have abated. Making sound
decisions is hard when your thinking is fuzzy and you’re not func-
tioning very well. You can get at least some of your symptoms
under control through herbs and supplements. (For a list of herbs
and supplements, refer to Chapter 7.) If your main problem is
Chapter 11: Making It through Your Day at Work 201
The 6:00 unwind
Unwinding after working a stressful day is hard. Be careful, because overwork can
cause your adrenals to become overactive and hypervigilant, thus triggering panic
attacks. To relax, instead of reaching for a stiff drink — which is taboo for
hypoglycemics — try doing one of the following:
 Practice deep breathing.
 Meditate.
 Participate in a yoga class.
 Take a long, relaxing bath with epsom salts.
 Listen to some music and read a good book. It has been discovered that watch-
ing TV or getting on the computer at night can interfere with sound sleep.
 Sleep well. When you’re working more than normal, you need to get as deep and
restful a sleep as possible. In order to get restorative sleep at night, sleep in a dark
room or wear eye shades. Remove all electrical appliances with flashing lights
from your bedroom; these appliances have been shown to impede deep sleep.

anxiety and depression, and natural remedies aren’t helping, try
medication. (To read about anxiety and depression, and medicine’s
role in treating these conditions, turn to Chapter 10.)
Of course, only you can decide what the best course of action is. If
you love your job, or if you desperately need the income, sit down
and figure out exactly how you need to change your work arrange-
ment. If a reasonable effort to change things on your part meets
with no results, you and your job may have to part ways. Make
sure that you get yourself a parachute before you take that leap,
though! Not having a job can be very stressful.
Passing up the caffeine
Java. The bean. Joe. Whatever you call it, it seems that everybody
is drinking coffee in the morning. Many people can’t even function
without caffeine as an eye-opener. But in fact, too much caffeine
actually adds to stress by making your body more prone to releas-
ing adrenaline, the stress hormone. Caffeine can also trigger hypo-
glycemic symptoms, which definitely add to any work stress you
may already experience.
Caffeine is detrimental to hypoglycemics. If you’re addicted to
coffee (you get a headache when you’ve gone awhile without a
mug, even if you drink only a cup a day), taper your use gradually.
If you try to stop cold turkey, you’ll get a headache. Although not
exactly like coffee, substitutes can provide you with the pleasure
and comfort of a nice, hot beverage. Try out different substitutes
to find the one you enjoy the most. The following list provides
some good ways to help you make the transition from coffee to
some healthy alternatives:
 Find good caffeine-free coffee substitutes. These may
include grain coffees or herbal teas. Decaffeinated coffee is
also a no-no because it still contains some caffeine.
 Drink green tea or herbal tea. You may want to try Japanese
barley tea (mugi-cha), which doesn’t have caffeine.
 Make a protein smoothie with protein powder, or create your
own favorite drink. Having protein helps stabilize your blood
sugar. Avoid using sugar or artificial sweeteners in your drink.
 Mix up some hot chocolate with carob powder and nut or
rice milk, and add some stevia to sweeten. Carob, a natural
chocolate substitute, doesn’t contain stimulants. It also helps
normalize hypoglycemia.
Part III: Emulating Lifestyles of the Well and Healthy 
202

 Drink the following morning elixir. If you really feel that you
can’t get going in the morning without that little zing of java,
try this morning elixir from IBS For Dummies, by Carolyn
Dean, MD, ND, and L. Christine Wheeler, MA (Wiley). Combine
a quart of water, the juice of one lemon, a pinch of cayenne,
and the contents of one capsule of ginger.
The ginger helps subdue any possible nausea that you may
feel from changing your diet, and the cayenne gets your circu-
lation going and keeps your hands and feet warm — a real
boon for hypoglycemics who tend to get cold hands and feet.
Some recipes for this drink use about 1⁄8 teaspoon of cayenne,
but to start, use just a pinch of this powerful healer. If you find
this drink too sour, add 1⁄8 teaspoon of stevia, if you’re able to
tolerate it.
If you absolutely must drink some coffee
 Don’t drink coffee on an empty stomach. It can be very hard
on your stomach; besides, it really wreaks havoc on your
blood sugar.
 Drink coffee with lots of cream or whole milk. The protein
and fat in the cream will help stabilize your blood sugar
(somewhat) and mitigate the negative effects of the caffeine.
(Remember, cream does add calories, and it’s not for you if
you’re allergic or lactose intolerant.)
 Take extra B-complex tabs. Coffee is believed to deplete the
vitamin B in your system.
 Cut way back. If you just can’t resist tasting coffee, take a few
sips and leave the rest.
Need a quick pick-me-up? Take deep, decaffeinated breaths. You
can go to the bathroom or the lounge and meditate for a few min-
utes, too. Or, if you have an official break time or lunch, walk
around the building. If you have enough time, you may even decide
to go to the gym. But don’t skip your lunch to do so.
Creating a cozy cubicle
Cubicles are just as much a part of some working cultures as coffee
drinking. Most people spend the majority of their waking time at
work, so you should create as healthy and as pleasant an environ-
ment as you can.
Chapter 11: Making It through Your Day at Work 203

To lessen a stressful work environment, you can make your cubicle
or work office a little cozier and a lot less stressful with the follow-
ing ideas:
 Reduce the noise. Noise pollution can add to stress, which in
turn can exacerbate hypoglycemic symptoms. If the noise in
your work environment bothers you, get a white noise genera-
tor. These machines can deflect unwanted sounds and mask
discordant noise by producing a smooth sound of rushing air
that creates a sense of calm. Some of them even produce a
variety of low frequency digital sounds, including the sounds
of a lakeshore, rain, surf, a brook, and a waterfall.
 Use environmentally sound cleaning products. People
whose bodies are very sensitive, like most low blood sugar
sufferers, are better off using only environmentally sound
cleaning products at home and in the office. Some particularly
susceptible people may become acutely ill if they work in
offices that suffer from sick building syndrome (buildings with
a high degree of indoor pollution). This often occurs in insu-
lated buildings with windows that don’t open. You may not
clean your own office, but if you discover anything at work
that you’re allergic to, find out how you can avoid exposure.
 Get an air purifier. If the quality of the air in your workplace is
a problem, an air purifier can help. Keeping plants on your desk
can also help; if nothing else, they can enliven your work space.
 Play some soft music. Music can have the same calming effect
as tranquilizers. Play relaxing music while you work. Just
make sure that you don’t bother your co-workers.
 Keep healthy snacks close by. Do you have a co-worker who
always sets out a bowl of candies for everyone? To avoid
temptation, don’t even get close to it. If you have some
healthy snacks nearby, chances are you won’t be as tempted.
 Ask your company to stock healthy snacks in vending
machines. Office vending machines are bad news. You’ll make
it easier for yourself if you make them off limits. If you can
think of a healthy food item you want that can be sold
through a vending machine, ask the vending company to
carry it. Call the company directly, or waylay the guy who
stocks the machines.
 Ask co-workers to bring in healthier snacks. Do they wheel
danishes and donuts into your office every morning? If so,
find out whether they can also start bringing in healthier
treats so that people have a choice. Because so many people
are on weight-reducing diets these days, you may find a lot of
supporters.

Part IV
Spinning a Network
of Support for
Yourself (and Others)

In this part . . .
W
hoever said that no man is an island unto himself
was certainly right. Everyone needs the support
of other people from time to time; nobody can make it
completely alone. In this part, we show you how to set
up a support network so that you don’t fall on your face
while you’re dealing with the side effects and aftereffects
of hypoglycemia. After all, everyone is bound to suffer at
times from low moods and self-doubts. When you’re feeling
down, you can open the book to this section and discover
how to get through those trying times.
This part also addresses those people closest to you.
They may not completely understand this condition, so
Chapter 14 gives them the support they need to better
ﬁgure out how hypoglycemia affects you the way it does.

Chapter 12
Jockeying for Support
In This Chapter
 Taking a self-inventory for your needs
 Joining a support group
 Relying on your buddy
S
upportive people in your life can help you live longer. Or
maybe they just make you feel like you live longer; either way,
it works. The fact is, humans are naturally social creatures —
homo sapiens would never have survived without banding
together in groups. In many, many ways, everyone is dependent on
everyone else. (Yes, even you, Mr. Macho Man.)
You need the support of others to help you deal with your hypo-
glycemia. Without it, you may end up wallowing when you could be
much happier. This chapter helps you garner that support from,
most importantly, yourself, support groups, and a buddy. (Check out
Chapter 13 for info on getting support from your friends and family.)
Grasping the Link between Support
and Hypoglycemia
Now this little exercise isn’t the least bit scientific (so don’t quote
us or shoot us), but think about what low blood sugar could mean
metaphorically: Sugar and sweets often symbolize love. So perhaps
you can link low blood sugar to lack of love (if you’re in love, and
your partner has hypoglycemia, check out Chapter 14), or at least
to the perception that you’re not getting the tender loving care
that you need. Perhaps you’re surrounded by loving people, but
you’ve walled yourself off from their love. Maybe you need to
mend some rifts in your relationships, or maybe you need to estab-
lish new relationships. Aside from the physiological basis for
addictions, a craving for sugar can mean a craving for love. (By the
way, we’re not suggesting that a high blood sugar level means that
you’re getting too much love — it means that you have sugar in

your blood, but your cells aren’t getting their share. So with both
conditions, you’re being effectively starved of fuel.)
Whatever your situation, you need to review your health and rela-
tionship history if you want to get your blood sugar under control.
A growing body of social and scientific evidence points to the vital
importance of social contact in the maintenance of your health.
You can start by first reviewing your health history. (Chapter 3
shows you how to observe your symptoms.) Then jot down the
names of all the people with whom you have important relation-
ships. This list should include family members, lovers, friends,
teachers, and social contacts who are significant to you. No need
to write long essays (unless you enjoy that); a few well-chosen
words will do. Write down how you feel about these people and
your interactions with them. If you’re feeling ambitious, see
whether you notice any connection between the foods you eat and
the people you hang out with. Maybe your mother loves to eat, and
she always entices you to eat forbidden foods. Or maybe your ex-
boyfriend loved to tempt you with chocolates.
Getting Yourself Out There
You can’t get support from your friends and family if you don’t ask
for it. And to ask for it, you have to make yourself accessible and
available to the people who matter most.
You’re thinking, but what if I live alone? What if I work 12-hour days
and am too pooped to go out? What if everyone dearest to me lives
in another state or even another country?
You can’t expect your family and friends to read your mind. (Check
out Chapter 13 for more on how you can ask your friends and family
to actually help.) You have to reach out to them and call them regu-
larly. Make yourself — and your phone company — happy. If you’re
cost-conscious, there are great long-distance deals available, as well
as cheap, pre-paid phone cards. And if you’re set up with broad-
band, you can call for free via the Internet. Explore your options.
If you don’t have a family — even a far-flung one — and you don’t
have a social network, take immediate action to start getting con-
nected to people. Start by getting involved with
 Community organizations (such as the YMCA)
 Social groups sponsored by your particular house of worship
 Classes that interest you (as opposed to those that don’t
interest you)
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
208

 Workshops and seminars
 Volunteer activities
 Professional or trade associations
 Support groups for hypoglycemics (more on this later in this
chapter)
 Health or fitness groups
You can find information about these types of groups in your local
newspaper or on the Internet.
Get a pet if you can, especially if you live alone and feel isolated.
You can get a cat, dog, rabbit, lizard, parakeet, finch, goldfish, or
whatever . . . anything that you can love and enjoy taking care of.
Studies show that owning and caring for a pet can not only relieve
isolation but also reduce family arguments and lead to lower levels
of anxiety and depression and fewer illnesses.
You may be wondering how any of this relates to low blood sugar.
It does! Because to properly treat yourself, you need to look at
every aspect of your life. Hypoglycemia is often called a lifestyle ill-
ness. Its treatment depends more on your diet and lifestyle than on
medication or any medical, surgical, or high-tech interventions.
Getting to Know Me
First things first. Get your food program in order (see Chapter 6).
Then write down exactly how you want to feel, and figure out ways
to rearrange your life to best support your journey back to health.
(Chapter 16 offers ideas to get you started.) For this purpose, sit
down and have a get-acquainted-with-yourself session. You can
have this session alone or with someone you trust.
Chapter 12: Jockeying for Support 209
Don’t pull the trigger
When it comes to hypoglycemia, what most often derails a treatment program?
Food! Food is the biggie, all right. So sit down and brainstorm on all the triggers that
can fire your craving for forbidden foods. Write down every single trigger — things,
people, or situations that can set off bad eating — that you can think of.
Triggers can be social situations, going to restaurants, losing your pet goldfish, win-
ning the lottery, and so on. Under each trigger, write down what you can do to avoid
getting derailed. Go on, wow everyone’s socks off with your creative solutions. (For
tips and ideas, see Chapter 16.)

If you decide to have a get-acquainted-with-yourself session with
someone at your side, make sure that you choose someone who’s
trustworthy and supportive. You don’t need negativity, criticism,
or put-downs. (“Oh hell, honey, you don’t have blood sugar prob-
lems, you just need a brain transplant.”)
To become better acquainted with yourself, follow these steps:
1. Get a notebook and write down everything you’re going
to do to get healthy.
Break the list down into the following categories:
• Physical goals
• How would you like to look and feel right now?
• How is your health?
• Diet
• Are you keeping a food journal? (See Chapter 6.)
• Are you keeping track of what foods you should eat
and what foods you should avoid? (See Chapter 6 for
a list.)
• Vitamins, supplements, and herbs
• What vitamins and supplements are you taking?
(Check out Chapter 7 for more info.)
• In what quantity are you taking them?
• Medication
• What medications are you taking?
• In what quantity are you taking them?
• Are you setting up and keeping appointments with
healthcare practitioners and therapists?
• Exercise plan
• What are your current measurements (chest, waist,
hips, and so on)?
• What is your current weight?
• What exercise plan are you going to follow?
• How many times a week will you exercise?
• How long will you exercise each time?
• Meditation, relaxation, and deep breathing
• How often are you meditating?
• How long do your sessions last?

2. Write exactly how the symptoms caused by your low
blood sugar have affected you in each of the following
areas:
• Health (see Chapter 3)
• Family
• Relationships
• Work/career (see Chapter 11)
• Short- and long-term goals
• Leisure activities
3. Write how you can avoid the problems caused by your
symptoms.
• Health and energy level
• Exercises (see Chapter 8)
• Meditation/breathing (see Chapter 9)
• Herbs, vitamins, and supplements (see Chapter 7)
• Job (see Chapter 11)
• How can you manage your symptoms at work?
• What can you tell your supervisors about your health
condition?
• Managing your moods (Chapter 10)
• Should you consider antidepressants?
• How can you deal with anger?
4. Write what you think life will be like when you’re free of
major symptoms.
• Family
• How much time are you spending with your family?
• How can you and your family have more fun together?
• Relationship goals
• What would you like your significant relationship to
be like?
• What can you do to achieve your ideal relationship?
• Support system choice
• What can you do to develop new friendships?
• How can you find groups with similar health goals?
Chapter 12: Jockeying for Support 211

• Spiritual needs
• What are you doing to meet your needs?
Religious/spiritual practices? Groups? Literature?
• How can you deepen your relationship with others
who have a similar spiritual bent?
• Career goals
• How do you feel about your job? Are you satisfied?
• Where would you like to be? How will you achieve
your goal?
• Educational goals
• Are you in school? Do you want to enroll in school?
• What would you like to accomplish?
• Others goals or concerns
• Do you want to start a new hobby?
• Do you want to improve another area of life that isn’t
listed here?
Choose three goals that you want to reach within the next year.
Pick something that’s easily attainable so that you can get a sense
of accomplishment. Every month, review what you’ve written so
that you can see how your objectives or perspectives may have
changed. Note whether you’re feeling more satisfied with life in
general as your health improves.
Joining the In-Crowd
Your family may be the best place to turn for help (check out
Chapter 13). However, sometimes your family just can’t or doesn’t
understand, and you need people who truly understand what
you’re going through. Because humans are social creatures, sup-
port groups give you the motivation to stick with a program that’s
not always easy. Over the long term, members of a group are often
much better at accomplishing their goals. Go to local community
centers or call hospitals to find groups specific to hypoglycemia.
Admittedly, groups for hypoglycemia aren’t as plentiful as those
for other ailments. If you can’t find a hypoglycemia-specific group,
sign up for groups that have informational or support meetings
about health and healing.
Or why not organize your own support group for hypoglycemia? If
you get involved with starting a support group, you may find it
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
212

easier to feel motivated. Okay, get the ball rolling! Don’t get bogged
down in details. You don’t have to wait until you find an ideal meet-
ing place for the group. Start with these steps:
1. Call up everyone you know who may be interested in
joining a support group for hypoglycemia.
Ask friends, neighbors, and colleagues whether they’re
interested in joining your group. You can also ask them
whether they know anyone else who may have low blood
sugar.
2. Put up flyers and ads promoting your group.
You can post messages on relevant Internet forums, or post
them in clinics, hospitals, universities, or churches. (Get
permission first.) You can also put them up in your neigh-
borhood supermarket, if there is a community bulletin
board.
3. Start your own Web site or newsletter.
For more info, check out Creating Web Pages For Dummies,
8th Edition, by Bud E. Smith and Arthur Bebak (Wiley).
4. Decide on a meeting place.
Consider meeting at the homes of members. If that isn’t fea-
sible, you can usually meet at libraries and bookstores for
free, and they may be more accessible for drop-ins. You
may even be able to get a group discount by purchasing
books on hypoglycemia or other related subjects at book-
stores where you frequently meet.
5. Consider charging a membership fee.
Discuss what you think is a fair amount to charge partici-
pants. You want to be able to cover expenses and have
some money left over for other purposes, such as inviting
speakers or financing creative events. Charging a member-
ship fee for the group may make people value it more.
Freebies just can’t get respect.
Netting some help
Finding online support groups — those you can contact through
the Internet — for hypoglycemics may be easier than finding
groups that meet in person. Key phrases to enter into a search
engine are hypoglycemia, support groups, or low blood sugar.
You can find numerous online support groups where you can dis-
cuss any issues you’re working through. (Check out the nearby
sidebar “Finding more support on the Web” for specific resources.)
Chapter 12: Jockeying for Support 213

Be careful when you post messages online. We’re not talking Big
Brother here, but unlike the spoken word, your written words are
stored, and the chance exists that someone, somewhere, can use
them against you. It’s not likely, but a little caution never hurt
anyone. Remember, too, that people you meet online can pretend
to be anyone they want to be. People can, and do, try on different
identities and different genders. Luckily, this practice is much
more common in groups devoted to the dating game; most of the
people involved in hypoglycemic groups are sincerely engaged in
getting their blood sugar levels under control and helping others
do the same.

Finding more support on the Web
The World Wide Web offers plenty of support if you feel like you’re fighting a never-
ending battle against hypoglycemia. Check out the following:
 eHealth Forum (http://ehealthforum.com/health/hypoglycemia.
html): An online community with a forum for health and medical questions,
including those related to hypoglycemia. Only registered members can post
messages, but anyone can read the messages. Membership is free. The site
also offers articles on popular health topics.
 HELP: Institute for Body Chemistry (http://home.earthlink.net/
~ekrimmel2): This national network was founded in 1979 by Edward and

features a comprehensive listing of articles and information about hypo-
glycemia, real-life stories of hypoglycemics, links to other sites, and a forum for
discussions related to hypoglycemia.
 Hypoglycemia 
Forum 
(http://hypoglycemia.itgo.com):
The
Hypoglycemia Forum Web site offers support and information to hypoglycemics

 The Hypoglycemia Support Foundation, Inc. (www.hypoglycemia.org):
This foundation was founded in 1980. The Web site provides book, audio, and
other products; diet information; surveys; and an online newsletter.

If you spend a great part of your time in front of the computer
already, try to participate in real flesh-and-blood groups in addition
to, or in lieu of, online support. You can’t substitute for face-to-face
experience. But chat groups, message boards, and e-mails are con-
venient ways to contact people. You may also be able to develop a
good rapport with people online.
Doing the 12-step
Twelve-step groups help members overcome various addictions by
following a series of (surprise!) 12 steps. If you can’t find a good
hypoglycemic group, and you don’t want to start one of your own,
12-stepping may be the solution for you. (If you’re looking for a
dance group, try classes.)
The following are some advantages to joining a 12-step program:
 They offer support to those who are desperate, whether that
desperation stems from illness, addiction, unhealthy relation-
ship dependencies, or other emotional issues. (Bring plenty of
tissues if you tend to get teary-eyed.)
 You can easily find a meeting in virtually any community.
There seem to be more 12-step groups than other types of
support groups. If you’d rather talk face to face, physically
attending a group is your best bet.
Chapter 12: Jockeying for Support 215
Eat before you type
Spending hours surfing the Internet can be all too easy. Before you go online, make
sure that you eat something. You may want to set a timer or alarm clock to remind
you to eat your next snack or meal. Keeping your blood sugar regulated is important.
You don’t want to get irritated and send nasty messages that you later regret. Some
otherwise sweet people can undergo a sudden transformation and lash out at noth-
ing in particular when their blood sugar is low. After they eat and restore themselves
to sanity, they then spend an inordinate amount of time apologizing to the hapless
recipients of their e-mail. If this pattern of behavior sounds familiar, post a reminder
note by your computer: Eat before you write. Don’t send messages when annoyed.
You may not see anyone’s face (unless you have a Web camera), and you may be
able to hide behind your computer screen, but that doesn’t mean you have a license
to be rude. Extend the same courtesy you show when interacting face to face. Don’t
spread rumors, send unsolicited ads, or insult people. Everyone is entitled to his
opinion. And when you’re involved with support groups, all your personal informa-
tion should be kept confidential.

 You don’t have to pay dues or fees. You may make voluntary
contributions.
You may feel isolated when trying to deal with your low blood sugar
problem. You may feel as though no one else has to face the same
challenges. But when you sit in these meetings, you’ll most likely
come away with the realization that everyone has her own cross to
bear. You may also come to realize that when the you-know-what
hits the fan, some people will help you clean it up. You’re not alone.
You can go to weekly meetings, and you can collect telephone num-
bers and personal contacts if you wish. You can also get a one-on-
one sponsor to help you overcome hurdles. The following sections
focus on some 12-step groups you may want to try.
Overeaters Anonymous
If you can’t find a group specific to hypoglycemia, Overeaters
Anonymous (OA) may be of value. A general misconception is that
you have to be overweight to join OA. Not so. Meetings are also
available for those suffering with bulimia or anorexia, two eating
disorders.
OA focuses on issues with food; it doesn’t necessarily focus on
weight loss or advocate any one type of diet. It addresses physical,
emotional, and spiritual well-being. OA can be a good choice for
hypoglycemics who may have some emotional issues with food. If,
no matter what you do, you can’t seem to curb your cravings, OA
may be a good forum for you. You can share with others the diffi-
culty of trying to adhere to a healthy diet.
Alcoholics Anonymous
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is for those who want to recover from,
or are in the process of recovering from, alcoholism. Alcoholism
isn’t unusual in hypoglycemics, because faulty glucose metabolism
may be at the root of the addiction in the first place. (See Chapter 2
for more on alcoholism and low blood sugar.) If you have parents
who are alcoholics, you’re likely to have either drinking problems
or hypoglycemia. Or maybe both.
If your drinking is getting out of hand, you should definitely con-
sider following the basic hypoglycemic diet and either enroll your-
self in a treatment program for alcoholics or join AA. Sticking to
your diet may also help you control your alcohol problems.
Emotions Anonymous
Emotions Anonymous (EA) is for people who have difficulty deal-
ing with their emotions. This group can help you deal with the
emotions and mood swings that may be caused, in part, by your
erratic blood sugar.
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
216

Don’t look for medical or psychiatric service from EA groups, and
don’t expect personal or family counseling. Just like all other 12-
step groups, EA groups aren’t professionally run organizations, but
the famous 12 steps give the groups structure and unity.
EA addresses a wide variety of emotional issues, including depres-
sion, anger, broken or strained relationships, grief, anxiety, low
self-esteem, panic, abnormal fears, resentment, jealousy, guilt,
despair, boredom, loneliness, withdrawal, obsessive and negative
Chapter 12: Jockeying for Support 217
Avoiding cults
When you’re in a physically and psychologically vulnerable state as a result of your
hypoglycemia, having some guidelines can help clarify matters. If you manage to
estrange everyone around you and are desperate to be admitted to a group — any
group — the possible danger rings even more true. And if it’s anything like the first
time you felt accepted and cared for, you’re wide open for manipulation.
So what’s a cult? Having a doctrine doesn’t make a group of people a cult. Even
claiming that drinking your own urine will heal you of hypoglycemia doesn’t make
a group of people a cult. (That just makes ’em wacky.) Although we have no hard and
fast rules for what officially constitutes a cult, watch out for certain signs. The fol-
lowing list provides some warnings you should be on the lookout for. The list isn’t
comprehensive, and not every cult displays all these characteristics, but if you
notice even a few of these signs, consider them a red flag:
 The group has a pyramid-type, authoritarian leadership structure.
 They claim to be the only way to truth, happiness, and healing from hypo-
glycemia or whatever else ails you.
 They use mind-control techniques on their members that may include subtle
brainwashing to make members feel that they’re the special “chosen” ones or
that the outside world is evil and dangerous.
 They use intimidation, such as belittling or actual threats of violence, to keep
members in line.
 They discourage or attempt to cut off your relationships with family and friends.
 They believe that they’re right and everyone else is wrong.
 They pressure you to give all that you can to the group — all your money and
possessions, for instance.
If you find yourself involved in a group like this, run, don’t walk! Cut off all contact
with them. Getting out is easier at the first warning sign than after you’ve been
involved for a long time. Don’t succumb to pressure to return. Go to a therapist who’s
knowledgeable about cults. Enlist the support of your family.

thinking, worry, and compulsive behavior. (Chapter 3 talks about
the symptoms of hypoglycemia.)
Buddying Up
With the buddy system, you pair up with a friend and help each
other attain a goal you both want. For instance, you may both want
to change your diet. The buddy system works by making you
accountable for what you’ve agreed to do for your own benefit.
Cheating or sliding can be all too easy if you’re the only one taking
account of your actions. When you have a friend who you have to
answer to, meeting your self-imposed goal (which may be to quit
eating sugar or start exercising) somehow becomes much more
important.
Keep a telephone handy so that you can call your buddy when the
following situations arise:
 You can’t stick to your exercise program.
 You’re tempted to go off your diet.
 You’re just having a bad day.
 You’re craving sugar because you’re lonely, angry, or
depressed.
Listening to your buddy’s problems will help you, as well. In fact,
you may begin to form a bond. When your buddy has a success,
you’ll feel as though you have had a success, as well. Your buddy’s
success may motivate you to reach your own health goals. When
you have someone pulling for you, you don’t want to let that
person down. And when you’re responsible for someone else,
you’re less likely to cheat.
This section helps you locate a suitable buddy and tells you what
you can do to start building a satisfying relationship with your
buddy.
Matching up with a buddy
Do you want a buddy to help you through the bad times and who
you can celebrate the good times? If so, the question is, “How can I
find a buddy?” Who should you pair up with?
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
218

The best place to start is to pair up with anyone who has a similar
goal or concern, and who you can trust to keep up the alliance.
Find someone else who’s concerned with low blood sugar. If you
can’t find someone who has hypoglycemia and wants to work on a
recovery program, remember that plenty of people want to lose
weight. So pair up with someone who’s trying to shed some
pounds or cut sugar from his diet.
Because your goals will be similar, you’ll probably work well
together. You’ll both need to exercise, and many foods that are 
off-limits for you are also banned from weight-reduction diets.
Differences are sure to occur, so you don’t need to follow the same
diet. Just explain to each other what you intend to do, and make
sure that your partner keeps his word. You need to be caring and
compassionate, but strict. Don’t let your partner slip up, and vice
versa. Be willing to scold each other in a caring, supportive way.
Starting off on the right foot
with your buddy
No matter who your buddy is, you want to make sure that you’re
both on the same page and that you both have the same expecta-
tions from each other.
At the initial meeting between you and your buddy, you need to
 Establish a meeting frequency.
• Depending on your schedule, agree to meet weekly or
biweekly. You’ll lose momentum if you go longer
between meetings.
• Determine what you want to do during your meetings.
Set time aside to meditate together or read quotes from
inspirational books.
• Agree on a time when you can call to check up on your
progress. Ideally, you should call every day; send an
e-mail instead if works better for you. You don’t have to
have a long-winded conversation — two to five minutes
will suffice for a daily check-in. When you’re experienc-
ing difficulties that can throw you off track, schedule a
longer conversation to discuss them with your buddy.
 Establish your goals. Be very clear on what you want to accom-
plish. For example, if your goal is to start keeping a food jour-
nal, put that down in writing. Tell your buddy your goal.
Chapter 12: Jockeying for Support 219

 Determine how you’ll meet your goals. You need a plan to get
where you want to go. Write out exactly how you’ll achieve
your goal. Your goal can be as simple as buying a notebook for
your food journal and carrying it around with you.
 Share literature so that you can better understand what the
other person needs. Ask your buddy to show you relevant
information on whatever he’s working on. For example, if his
goal is to quit smoking, agree to read any information he may
have about smoking and how to quit the habit. Likewise,
share any books you have about hypoglycemia. You don’t
have to read everything; just enough to get an understanding
of the issues your buddy is facing.
 Show your buddy everything you write down in terms of
your wants and needs. If you don’t write everything down,
you’ll forget. After you write it down, then share it with your
buddy so that you don’t have any misunderstandings.
 Explain your diet and the concept. (See Chapter 6 for diet
information.) Your buddy needs to understand the diet you’re
following and why so he can better support you in your
efforts to stick to your diet. He won’t be able to support you
effectively if he doesn’t understand how important your diet
is to your recovery.
 Discuss rewards. When you meet your goals, take turns
rewarding each other. You can give each other a massage, go
to a movie or for a hike, or do anything that you find pleasur-
able. (Don’t use food as a reward!) This is one sweet alliance
that won’t cause your blood sugar to come crashing down.
The downside of the buddy system is the possibility that one or
both of you may slip up on your commitments to yourselves and 
to each other. You can falter despite the best of intentions. Maybe
your hypoglycemic symptoms are too much for you to handle; or
you have other things going on that demand more of your time; or
you find that you’re paired up with the wrong person. If you slip
up, don’t despair. Discuss it with your buddy to see whether you
both want to give the buddy system another shot, change what
you’re doing, or just drop it. If you decide that the partnership 
isn’t working out, you may want to find someone else.

Chapter 13
Dealing with Family and
Friends: Eat and Let Eat
In This Chapter
 Talking to your loved ones about hypoglycemia
 Communicating your needs
 Sticking to your diet in the face of naysayers
T
he world would be fine and splendid if you could always count
on those nearest and dearest to you to be your most enthusias-
tic cheerleaders. They’re the ones who exert the most power over
you. Yet the sad truth is that, instead of inspiring you, your friends
and family often are the very ones who drag you down. They may
well be good, decent people who have the most honorable inten-
tions, but they can still thwart your attempt to regain your health.
Your first task, therefore, is to help your loved ones understand
this admittedly perplexing syndrome. After they understand it,
they may be much more willing to support your recovery process.
Then and only then can you proceed to ask them for help in chang-
ing your lifestyle and dealing with the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
Don’t assume that they’ll automatically know what to do; you have
to let them know exactly what you need from them. Present your
requests clearly and directly, and don’t place blame on anyone.
This chapter gives you the tools to communicate your wants effec-
tively — specifically in terms of changing your diet — and shows
you how to deal with your family and friends.
How Hypoglycemia Can Affect
Your Relationships
When it comes to hypoglycemia, most people, perhaps even those
individuals closest to you, may not be very sympathetic or helpful.

Why is this? Well, first of all, regardless of how wretched it may
make you feel, hypoglycemia is generally not life threatening.
Secondly, people still tend to believe that it’s all in your head or that
you’re just malingering. Perhaps in their opinion you were doing just
fine before, so why this sudden and drastic attempt to change?
The emotional repercussions of hypoglycemia can take a toll on
relationships. If you suffer from blood sugar imbalance, your brain
isn’t getting enough glucose, its primary fuel. It’s like sputtering
along in a car with an almost-empty tank. You’re not operating at
your best, and you’re not feeling your best. Studies have shown
that when a person is suffering from hypoglycemia, judgment
becomes clouded, and the person becomes easily irritable, even
irrational. Add to that depression and constant mood swings —
and you can see how difficult it can be for family and friends to
deal with a hypoglycemic (check out Chapter 14, which speaks
directly to your loved ones).
Explaining to Your
Significant Other
People who have normal metabolism sometimes can’t understand
the energy fluctuations your low blood sugar causes. These fluctu-
ations are one of the first things you need to help your loved ones
understand, and this section can help.
Starting with open dialog
You probably don’t need to be reminded that absolute and com-
plete honesty is critical in any relationship. And when you’re talk-
ing about something as important as your health, you owe it to
your partner to come completely clean. Even if you’re afraid of
being judged, if you don’t discuss your health issue openly, you’ll
never win your partner over to your side or at least help him gain
some understanding of what living with a metabolic syndrome like
hypoglycemia means.
To start off, try to make your conversation as simple as possible.
Don’t overwhelm your partner with a lot of unimportant or irrele-
vant information. Get to the point, be focused, and stay positive.
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
222

To convey information about your condition, take a cue from the
politicians:
 Prepare your statements in advance so that you don’t
become confused and forget the important points. Write out
exactly what you’re going to say and memorize it. Don’t simply
blurt out an explanation, or you may say the wrong things.
 Collect and present literature about hypoglycemia. People
tend to believe what’s in print. Gathering info shows that
you’ve done some homework and aren’t just giving a vapid
excuse as to why you’ve been encountering health challenges.
 Try not to look like you’re announcing a stock market
crash. A talk doesn’t need to be deadly serious. You can be
informal but informative. Or, conversely, you can ham it up —
go all out and type out written statements for everyone to
read. (You can also photocopy some pages from this book.)
 Let your loved ones understand that you’re nothing if not
serious about the lifestyle changes you’re going to make.
(Well, aren’t you?) But have a sense of humor about it. Don’t
make it sound as though you’re going to do yourself in if your
family doesn’t do what you want them to do.
The most important points to convey include the following:
 What hypoglycemia is
 The importance of regulating your blood sugar
 How the wrong foods can contribute to your condition
 The health impact of a blood sugar imbalance
 The food plan you need to follow
 Exercise and other lifestyle changes you want to make
Chapters 2, 6, and 8 provide the info everyone needs about the
particular topics listed here.
If this list seems like too much to discuss, simply inform your
family that you have hypoglycemia and you’re making dietary
changes. Then show them the list of foods you can and can’t eat.
Helping your significant other cope
You may feel as if you need to brace yourself for the worst after you
have the heart-to-heart with your partner. She may take it well. Or
she may not. Either way, there are things you can do to make it
easier for her to accept your blood sugar issue as a legitimate illness
Chapter 13: Dealing with Family and Friends: Eat and Let Eat 223

and to help her better cope with the dietary and lifestyle changes
that are ahead of you.
The following can help you help your significant other:
 Be open and willing to answer any questions she may have.
Your partner is bound to have many questions. You’re setting
the right tone by addressing any concerns she may have, and
demonstrating that you value her perceptions.
 Talk to each other regularly. Good communication is the key
to making a relationship work. When you encounter a major
life change, you have to negotiate the transition by discussing
any issues that come up.
 Regardless of what comes up, never blame your partner for
what ails you. Blame is a good way to kill good will in anyone,
especially someone close to you. By staying neutral and non-
judgmental, you’re more likely to get your partner’s under-
standing and cooperation.
 Take responsibility for your own condition. You may find
yourself getting cranky or depressed because of your blood
sugar imbalances. Be sure to apologize and make amends when
you’re feeling more stable. Doing so ensures that your partner
is more willing to support you during your difficult times.
 Try not to take anything too seriously. Schedule lots of fun
time together. Find the humor and the silver lining in any
situation.
Talking to Your Children
about Hypoglycemia
Your partner isn’t the only person who should be informed about
your metabolic syndrome. Children can sense when a parent is
sick — hiding your condition from them isn’t fair. You probably
can’t anyway, because you’ll need to change your diet and make
other adjustments that may have your children wondering what’s
going on.
This section provides some helpful ways to talk to your children
and help them understand that your condition isn’t life threatening.
Keep it simple
Even with adults, you need to keep things simple. Naturally, with
children, keeping your explanations as simple as possible is even
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
224

more important, because they may not be able to grasp the com-
plexity of a health issue such as hypoglycemia. Don’t hide your dis-
comfort behind technical terms. View things from the perspective
of a child.
Children have a shorter attention span than adults, so avoid long-
winded explanations. Drawings and other visual aids are especially
effective for children.
Be prepared for questions
Children are very curious (as if you didn’t already know!) and will
likely pepper you with questions. Answer every question to the
best of your ability. It’s important that children understand exactly
what’s going on with your health. Otherwise, they may become
prone to anxiety and may let their imagination get the best of them.
When answering their questions, keep the following in mind:
 Don’t patronize and don’t minimize their fears. Children
hate being talked down to. And when you shush them and dis-
count their fears, they’re likely to become even more afraid.
Simply tell them that you’re going to eat a healthier diet
because you want to be healthy to take better care of them.
 Address every concern your children may express. Don’t
get angry or snap at them if they’re resentful that they don’t
get to eat “fun” foods anymore. Tell them that they’ll still get
to enjoy some of their favorite foods, but it’ll be healthier for
the family to gradually change the diet so that everyone can
be healthy and energetic. Because hypoglycemia isn’t a life-
threatening condition, don’t make it a big deal.
 Be specific and clear. Don’t use medical jargon that they
don’t understand. Use plain English. If an older child wants to
understand more, you may be able to explain blood sugar
mechanisms. But for a very small child, keep it very simple.
All you have to say is that you’ll be eating more vegetables
and staying away from sweets.
Reiterate that they didn’t
make you sick
Some children may have a natural tendency to believe that they
caused their parents’ illnesses. Let them know that nothing they do
can cause any kind of illness, including hypoglycemia. The fact that
your body has a faulty mechanism for balancing blood sugar prop-
erly isn’t their fault.
Chapter 13: Dealing with Family and Friends: Eat and Let Eat 225

If you’ve been moody or depressed because of the hypoglycemia,
say something like this: “I’m sorry, it’s not your fault that I’ve been
feeling ill/unhappy. It’s not because you’re bad that I’ve been so
irritable with you. My doctor told me it’s because I have low blood
sugar. Now I’m changing to a healthier diet, and these problems
I’ve had will go away.”
Involving the Whole Family
Your family may ask you right off the bat what they can do to help.
Naaaah! That would never happen, right? Asking for help from the
people you love most (and who love you most) rests on your
shoulders.
This section approaches the different ways you can talk to your
family about your hypoglycemia, how you can get your family to
help you deal with your hypoglycemia, and how your family can
help with mealtime.
Can we talk?
If you want to involve the whole family, you have to talk. Set aside
a time to talk. Make the occasion relaxing by pouring some herbal
tea and playing soft music. Tell your loved ones that you want to
have a heart-to-heart talk about an important matter.
 Embrace your sweetheart or family members and make up
for whatever nasty behavior your hypoglycemia caused.
Maybe you’ve let your significant other feel very much
insignificant.
• Explain that a lot of the bad things — outbursts, fights,
and misunderstandings — were due to the effects of low
blood sugar.
• Accept full responsibility for your actions.
 Get your loved ones to understand the sincerity of your
intentions to redirect your lifestyle.
 Get your loved ones to understand your hypoglycemia.
• Teach them about hypoglycemia and faulty glucose
metabolism.
• Read them passages from this book.
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
226

• Create a list that describes who you are and what you’re
going through as you deal with your hypoglycemia (see
Chapter 12 to become better acquainted with yourself,
and then use that info to talk to your loved ones).
Sometimes people understand written things better.
Helping your loved ones help you
Changing your diet and entire lifestyle isn’t easy. Don’t make it
more difficult on yourself by being a lone ranger. Getting practical
and emotional support from your family and friends can make your
recovery easier. But sometimes those near and dear to you just
don’t understand that you need their help. You have to reach out
and ask for the help. When they understand what you’re striving
for and why, they’re more likely to be on your side.
Keep the following in mind when asking your family and friends for
help:
 Ask yourself first what your family can do to help. (Either
that or ask what you can do for your country.) Certain house-
hold chores may become difficult for you to do, for example,
when hypoglycemia is paired with other syndromes like
fibromyalgia.
 State your requests clearly and in a matter-of-fact way. For
example, you’re the cook, but you find that brain fog inter-
feres with your duties. Give explicit instructions for someone
else to make out a shopping list for you. Make meal planning a
joint, cooperative venture.
 Don’t turn requests into threats or demands. At the same
time, don’t sound apologetic.
 If stress is a problem — and it usually is — figure out how
you can tackle it together. Brainstorm ways to deal with this
and other issues.
 Use “I” statements. Statements that begin with “I” instead of
“you” sound less like accusations. For example, suppose you’re
hurt because your spouse refuses to support you. You shouldn’t
say, “You’re a real moron for not understanding how important
this is to me. You always were a &%*$ [fill in with any of your
favorite four-letter words].” A far better approach is, “I feel hurt
when you won’t listen to my explanations about how food can
seriously affect my body chemistry and my ability to function. I
tell myself then that you don’t care about my health.”
 Don’t interrupt, bring up unrelated elements, or change the
subject. Setting ground rules can go a long way toward
smoother communication.
Chapter 13: Dealing with Family and Friends: Eat and Let Eat 227

 Use any digressions to get back to the main point. Digression
can bring up significant issues. For instance, when you’re
trying to communicate the frustrations you experience with
hypoglycemia, and your partner complains that you never
come through with your promises, you have the chance to
point out that your failure to follow through is related to your
particular biochemical disorder, and now that you know
what’s causing these problems, you’re bound and determined
to change them — and you need all the support you can get.
Repeat or paraphrase what your loved one just said. This
approach is also useful if you suffer from brain fog and tend to
space out what someone’s saying. Some digressions may lead
to a whole different conversation. In that case, write it down
and promise to talk about it later. Set aside a specific time to
discuss the issue to make it clear that you’re not simply
making excuses to avoid the subject.
 Don’t keep your problem to yourself. You may think that keep-
ing your hypoglycemia to yourself will ensure harmony, but in
the long run, this plan can backfire. Rather than let health prob-
lems create difficulties in your relationships, use them as a
communication bridge to build a stronger foundation.
 Express appreciation for any support your family gives you.
Giving thanks for specific acts of consideration is also a good
idea. For instance, you may want to say, “Timothy, I really am
thankful that you agreed to do all the grocery shopping for us.
It helps me avoid foods I’m not supposed to have.”
 Express the love you feel. Don’t bottle it up; spread it around.
Show love to your family and friends every day. Spend time
having fun with them. Doing so works wonders with keeping
your body chemistry balanced.
When can we eat?
Family functions often center on food. Think of the major holidays
and special events from your life: cake on your birthday and turkey
on Thanksgiving, not to mention all those summer barbecues and
late-night pizzas. Then you have the daily grind. Someone has to
cook dinner. Mac and cheese, anyone?
After talking with your family about what you’re experiencing, tell
them what you need in terms of food. For more information about
food and diet, check out Chapter 6. In the meantime, try these
tactics:
 Tell your family that you need to eat certain foods, avoid
some foods, and eat frequently.
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
228

 Explain that you need their help in sticking to your food plan.
Their help may involve reminding you to eat at appropriate
times or helping with the preparation of the proper foods.
 Let them know what you don’t want from them. For instance,
you don’t need anyone to lay a guilt trip on you.
 Write down a list of items for your diet and go grocery shop-
ping with your spouse or other willing family members.
 If you’re not the house chef, sit down with the cook and
explain all your dietary requirements. Make a copy of your
requirements so that the cook can refer to them easily. You
can also offer to take turns cooking, if you aren’t already
doing so. Or you may want to cook together sometimes.
Do you have kiddies? Use this time to wean them off junk foods.
They’ll probably moan about not being able to eat the foods that
all their friends are eating. However, don’t force them to give up
everything they like. As long as the bulk of their meals are whole-
some, and they don’t have special health problems requiring a par-
ticular diet, you shouldn’t be overly strict. Simply stick with your
own diet. When you become fit, strong, and energetic — and more
balanced emotionally — they may become so impressed that
they’ll want to follow the example you set.
So you’ve created a food plan and now you’re talking to your family
about the do’s and don’ts of the hypoglycemically correct diet.
What better time to also discuss the when’s of eating — in other
words, good times for you to munch. If you’re like most hypo-
glycemics, you’ll have to eat fairly often — and you’ll always need
to have a snack within easy reach. Or, conversely, you may be the
minority who has to space your meals apart carefully and not eat
too frequently in order to stay symptom-free. Either way, planning
is essential. And getting the understanding, if not the help, of your
family is a good idea. You may try writing up an eating schedule
and taping it to the kitchen wall as a reminder for everyone. (And
carry a copy of it with you for easy referral.) When everyone is on
the same page, sticking to the timetable is much easier.
Chapter 13: Dealing with Family and Friends: Eat and Let Eat 229
When your loved one won’t help
What if your spouse won’t cooperate with your food needs? Well, for starters, you
may want to consider couples counseling! Meanwhile, get some help from good
friends and a support group. Consult an online hypoglycemia support group (see
Chapter 12) for suggestions on what you can do when family members won’t help.
You may also want to use your support group for developing relationships.

You can change cooking from a chore to a big, fun family affair. One
family, for instance, planned everything so that they could cook
enough food to last an entire month. (Hey, what are freezers for?)
They chose a day when they could all go grocery shopping together.
When they finished shopping, they lugged a humongous amount of
food to the car. They went wild the following day, cooking batch after
batch of wonderful food. Everyone chipped in, including the kids.
If you shudder at the thought of preparing a month’s worth of
meals, you can fix food for a few days or a week or two. When
hunger comes knocking at the door (actually, it shouldn’t if you eat
regularly like you’re supposed to), you won’t be tempted to gnaw
at the forbidden when you have a delectable and healthy meal
readily available.
Dealing with the Doubting
Thomases
It’s a fact of life. People may give you grief about your condition.
Many people don’t believe that diet and nutrition can have such a
profound effect on someone with a sensitive body chemistry. Such
people may think you’re off the wall. They may even accuse you of
malingering.
We want to say “Tough it out. Pump up your emotional defense
muscles. Deflect the verbal punches.” But that’s much easier said
than done, especially when you’re feeling out of balance.
Although you may encounter a few doubters, you don’t have to feel
any more pain because of their negative responses. This section
helps you stay clear of their negative behavior, avoid any
unneeded conflict, and figure out how to protect yourself.
Staying clear of negativity
The best way to deal with doubting Thomases? Don’t listen to them.
When possible, avoid negative exchanges with doubters or other
unsupportive people. Those exchanges can drive you back to emo-
tional eating habits, which can trigger or aggravate your symptoms.
The following can help you:
 Stop them in their tracks. Refuse to discuss hypoglycemia or
related topics with them. You can’t convert someone with a
heated exchange.
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
230

 Switch the subject. You can’t and won’t convert or convince
someone with a heated exchange, so change the subject. If the
doubter persists, be firm in telling him that you don’t care to
discuss it with him.
 Have some fun with them. You don’t have to defend yourself.
Instead of letting doubters get on your nerves, quibble over
absolute irrelevancies, throw back non-sequiturs, recite non-
sense poems, and confuse the heck out of them. As the saying
goes, if you can’t say anything nice, say something surreal.
If your family members give you grief when you speak to them
about changing your diet, they may be feeling threatened by the
prospect of change. You’re tampering with diet and nutrition, the
very foundation of family life — daily meals! If your family’s eating
habits are less than healthy, the prospect of change may trigger
feelings of anxiety or guilt. The best remedy is to offer as much
love and reassurance as you can. It may help to point out that
you’ll be a calmer, happier, more loving person as your blood sugar
becomes better regulated and more balanced.
If you’re without kith or kin, or your family simply doesn’t support
you, seek support elsewhere. Find advocates on your behalf and
create a support network for yourself. (Flip to Chapter 12 for sug-
gestions on setting that up.) Whenever possible and practical, get
together with those in your support network to chat, share meals,
and so on. Perhaps you can even host a get-together in your own
home.
Avoiding conflict
You shouldn’t be afraid of conflict; it’s unavoidable in any relation-
ship. You need to figure out how to work through disputes in a
healthy manner.
Avoiding those you don’t care about is one thing. With those
whose lives are closely intertwined with yours, however, wanting
to explain your side of the story is reasonable. If you’re unable to
resolve differences, however, take these tips to task:
 Let it slide. The best you can do in such cases is to agree to
disagree.
 Choose your battles carefully. Conserve your energy for get-
ting well. The erratic blood sugar syndrome may have drained
you of energy or left you feeling out of control, scrambling to
put the pieces of your life together.
Chapter 13: Dealing with Family and Friends: Eat and Let Eat 231

 Show consideration for others. Showing consideration helps
avoid misunderstandings or disagreements. In the case of
social situations, such as dinner invitations, you can show
consideration by alerting your host or hostess in advance.
(Check out Chapter 16 for more details.)
Maintaining your boundaries
When the poet Robert Frost wrote that good walls make good
neighbors, he was presenting sensible advice on living. By erecting
a wall (literally as well as figuratively), you ensure that your neigh-
bors respect your privacy and refrain from sticking their noses in
your business. Just as a wall around your house protects you from
prying eyes and trespassers, maintaining healthy emotional and
mental boundaries prevents people from meddling in your affairs
and keeps them from getting unwanted control of you.
Having healthy boundaries also means that you don’t let other
people’s doubts seep into your consciousness, undermining your
commitment to your recovery.

One man’s ham
Katie, an American expatriate living in Tokyo, is a vegetarian who prefers to eat
whole, natural, healthy foods. Finding restaurants in Japan that serve vegetarian
fare is very difficult, so she compromises when eating out with people. One evening
she went to a restaurant with a group of friends. She ordered a bowl of noodles that
the waitress assured her didn’t contain meat. When the noodles were brought to her
table, however, they were swimming in greasy meat — too much for her to pick
aside. She therefore reminded the waitress that she didn’t eat meat and sent the
bowl back to the kitchen. When the waitress brought back some more noodles, they
were smothered with strips of ham. At that point, Katie and her friends left the
restaurant without paying for their food, which they hadn’t touched.
Being hungry and crabby (with their blood sugar plummeting, no doubt), they hurled
insults at the restaurant staff before taking off. The incensed cook chased them
down, grabbed the most defenseless-looking woman, and beat her down. The
women called the police, who then forced them to pay for their meals. Why?
According to the policeman, the restaurant had acted in good faith by serving them
a vegetarian dish. Ham, he pointed out, isn’t meat. Food that’s generally accepted
as vegetarian in Japan differs from what Westerners regard as vegetarian.
When in doubt — particularly if you’re surrounded by hostile people — don’t press
the issue. Nibble on your snack if you’re hungry and don’t waste time arguing.

Boundary violations occur when people
 Tell you what you ought to be feeling
 Tell you what you ought to eat (unless they’re medical
professionals)
 Tell you how to run your life
 Suggest that you have no right to feel the way you do
 Make you feel guilty for having needs
 Make you feel guilty for needing reasonable accommodations
 Wonder out loud why you’re always this or that (sick or tired,
for example)
 Put you down or insult you in any way
Notice all the “oughts”? They ought not tell you how to be! But you
definitely ought to
 Be honest with yourself. Doing so helps you know very
clearly what you need and what’s destructive.
 Let others know when you reach your limits or they tres-
pass on your boundaries. Be confident when expressing your
limits and boundaries.
 Set very clear limits regarding what you’ll tolerate. When
others make demands on your time and energy that you can’t
comfortably honor because of your health issues, calmly tell
them so (in no uncertain terms).
 Offer choices when someone makes demands you can’t
honor comfortably. One way to handle the demands of others
is to give them a choice. For instance, you can say, “I can
either take the kids to the ball game or cook dinner, but not
both. Which do you want me to do?” Make sure that you pro-
vide a clear message that you want to do your share, but you
can’t be expected to do everything. You’ll be leaving room to
work out a compromise.
 Watch your tone. It’s not so much what you say but how you
say it. If you whine, people react negatively. If you sound
uncertain, others question you. Be as confident and upbeat as
you can. Make your requests sweet and simple. And smile.
Sabotaging the saboteurs
Your doubters and critics — inner and outer — try to sabotage your
best efforts. You’ll always find people who delight in criticizing you,
Chapter 13: Dealing with Family and Friends: Eat and Let Eat 233

tormenting you, and making you doubt that anything you do will
ever improve your health. Or maybe they don’t set out to destroy
you, but they whine about everything. Either way, these people are
negative because they’re unhappy with themselves. Remember that
their negativity has nothing to do with you or your blood sugar.
Others
Like alcoholics who discover that they need a different circle of
friends if they’re to stay sober, you may have to let go of some
friendships that are no longer serving your purpose. Bad friends
prod you to go off your food program or complain that you’re no
longer any fun because you don’t wash down a whole chocolate
cake with root beer, or chug-a-lug a jug of beer as you scarf down
mashed potatoes and deep-fried chicken.
Here are some suggestions for what to do when your critics start
harping on about your new lifestyle, and no amount of reasoning
on your part makes a dent. These suggestions are by no means a
staple of good communication. But they sure can be fun!
 Walk out of the room.
 Interrupt them repeatedly.
 Laugh hysterically and don’t explain why.
 Keep saying that you don’t understand, and ask them to
repeat themselves until you wear them down.
 Agree with them wholeheartedly and continue doing what you
have to do.
 Thank them for sharing.
 Pretend that they’re not there.
 Insist that health is now your new priority, and simply end the
discussion.
Yourself
If you’re your own personal saboteur, get guidance on positive self-
talk or cognitive therapy. These days you can find numerous good
books and audio programs that teach you how to change habitual,
negative, fear-based thinking into “real-based” thinking.
With this type of thinking, you don’t repeat mindless positive affir-
mations. Rather, you use affirming but realistic statements to steer
your behavior in a more productive direction. After you get the hang
of it, you’ll make radical changes in your thinking, which can help
you better control your diet and improve your blood sugar balance.

Your Sweetie?
In This Chapter
 Living with a hypoglycemic
 Offering support for a win-win relationship
 Helping your child deal with hypoglycemia
 Getting the whole family to support your battle against low blood sugar
 Cooking for your lifestyle
I
f you’re living with — or closely interacting with — a hypo-
glycemic, you know that it’s not exactly what you’d call a
Sunday picnic in the park. You may have discovered that your
family member, aside from any admirable qualities he may pos-
sess, isn’t exactly made of sugar, spice, and everything nice. He
may be the sweetest, most charming, and most considerate person
in the world one minute, purring along contentedly, and the next
minute, he may suddenly turn his fangs on you. Indeed, you may
wonder whether your family member isn’t suffering from a Jekyll-
and-Hyde–type personality. You’re right, in a sense.
Depending on how severe the symptoms are, a hypoglycemic is
probably taking quite a ride. He may be experiencing a roller
coaster of chaotic emotions and unpredictable mood shifts. Life
may have simply become unmanageable. If so, take heart. It can all
be turned around. If your loved one follows the eating program
outlined in this book, he will soon be restored to sanity. How soon
he finds relief from his symptoms depends on various factors, such
as age, body constitution, discipline, and so on. In most cases,
however, he can feel some relief after several weeks; you should
see major changes after several months.
Whether you’re the spouse, lover, parent, child, or friend of a hypo-
glycemic, your support can make all the difference in the world.
This chapter shows how you can support him by improving your
knowledge about the disease, using productive communication,
joining your love in the preparation of food, and improving your

own eating habits. You can make recovery from this pernicious
condition faster, smoother, and easier.
Introducing Mr. (or Ms.) Hyde
So you have a Hyde on your hands: Your loved one is lashing out,
and you’re bearing the brunt. You can run from Hyde, or you can
remember that Jekyll is in there. You’re already solidly on the road
to showing support: You’re here, aren’t you?
This section shows you where to turn so you can better grasp your
Mr. (or Ms.) Hyde’s hypoglycemia. It also discusses Hyde’s symp-
toms so you know what to expect.
Understanding Hyde’s condition
To offer the right kind of support, a solid understanding of hypo-
glycemia is useful. As with any illness, the more knowledge you
have, the better. For starters, you can
 Read this book. You aren’t surprised, are you?
 Check out other resources on hypoglycemia. This book
includes many Web sites and resources that provide more info.
You can also find books at your local library or bookstore.
 Talk to other hypoglycemics and their families. Other people
who’ve lived with the same situation you have can offer you
tips, examples, and moral support in a way that no one else
can. When you talk to someone who’s suffered through similar
problems, solutions or explanations offered can feel so much
more real and immediate than reading the same thing in a
book. Besides, you won’t feel so alone or isolated.
 Consult with knowledgeable healthcare practitioners.
Professionals can give you insight, as well as provide a med-
ical perspective that you or others may have missed. And
needless to say, consult with a healthcare practitioner to
make sure that your loved one is truly suffering from hypo-
glycemia and not some other condition.
 Discuss the disorder with the sufferer. Communication is the
key to resolving any difficulties, regardless of the problem. As
with any health condition, hypoglycemia can create tension
and misunderstandings.
 Put on headphones and sing as loud as you can. Okay, maybe
not the best idea, unless you want to get the local dogs barking.
Pursuing these paths to knowledge can lead you directly into the
gaping mouth of what you run up against during one of Hyde’s hor-
rible hissy fits: symptoms.

236

Identifying Hyde’s symptoms
Recognizing the typical signs of low blood sugar is crucial to help-
ing yourself and your loved one. Common symptoms (which we
discuss in more detail in Chapter 3) include
 Irritation
 Mental confusion
 Temper outbursts
 Crying jags
 Forgetfulness
 Excessive yawning (despite adequate sleep)
 Suddenly and inexplicably falling asleep (even when not in bed!)
The number, frequency, and severity of symptoms differ for each
individual. Some people may be only mildly affected by symptoms,
but it’s probably fair to say that, for most hypoglycemics, life is a
constant battle. They often struggle to get going and keep going
when the spirit is willing but the body is flagging. Far too many
have paid the price in checkered careers, strained interpersonal
relationships, and unfulfilled dreams. And you, too, as a family
member, have paid the price. Fortunately, you can do something
about the symptoms associated with hypoglycemia.
Knowing what to expect can lead you to talk with your family
member about what she’s going through. As you discuss the ways
that you can make it easier for her to change her diet and anything
else that may be impeding her progress, your supporting role
becomes clearer. The road to recovery starts with communication.
Talking It Over
Your loved one may act like a beast when she’s having an attack of
low blood sugar, but remember that she’s a human being, and so
are you. Use your tongue and teeth to talk to each other, not to
tear each other to shreds. Words can heal as much as they can
hurt; you just have to know the right words to say. When some-
one’s acting out, knowing what to say and what not to say can help
keep a volatile situation from getting out of control.
To help keep the dust down while your family member is calm, the
following sections give you some specific steps for communicating
with a hypoglycemic and some do’s and don’ts for talking with a
hypoglycemic who’s attempting to overhaul her diet and possibly
change her exercise and work habits, as well.
Chapter 14: Suffering Along with Your Sweetie? 237

Starting with the four Rs
Talking with your loved ones is an easy enough skill to develop,
but because it’s not something you’re likely to know instinctively,
we offer you the four Rs.
You can put the four Rs into action by following these steps:
1. Recognize that when your loved one has hissy fits, it’s the
low blood sugar talking.
Don’t take hypoglycemic symptoms personally. When a
person has a hypoglycemic episode, not enough sugar is
getting into the brain. The first area of the brain to shut
down is the neocortex (the “civilized” portion of the brain),
where higher learning and thinking take place. (Check out
Chapter 2 for more info.)
2. Refrain from getting involved in the drama.
Avoid these things:
• Criticizing
• Reasoning with the person
• Getting drawn into an argument
Of course, if someone snaps at you or behaves in an inap-
propriate fashion, reacting negatively is only human.
Delivering a comeback may feel most natural and satisfying
in the heat of the moment, but you end up only frustrating
yourself. Not only do you fail to accomplish anything, but
you may also make the battle escalate.
3. Respond with compassion.
The following sections tell you how to convey your sup-
portive feelings to the sufferer.
4. Remind the hypoglycemic to eat.
Offer high-quality snacks. The snacks should have some
protein and complex carbs: a boiled egg or a stick of celery
with nut butter, for example. Do not, under any circum-
stances, provide anything with sugar and refined flours. You
can rule out sodas, pastries, cookies, and ice cream, among
other common snacks. (See Chapter 6 for acceptable
snacks.) Remember that even a small amount of sugar or
simple carbs can trigger symptoms.
You can always walk away from the situation for awhile. After the
dust settles and your loved one’s blood sugar returns to normal
(whatever her optimal level may be), she’ll most likely apologize
profusely. When the reconciliation begins, you can at last attempt
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
238

to have a discussion. If you need to make a joint decision about
something, this is the time to do it. Don’t try to make important
decisions when her brain has shut down from lack of fuel.
Giving these words the green light
People are apt to think of low blood sugar sufferers as lazy and
undisciplined, or as hypochondriacs who dream up imaginary ill-
nesses in a desperate bid for attention. Low blood sugar sufferers
receive little, if any, sympathy or understanding — even from
themselves! They’re often met with blame, criticism, or irritation.
Hypoglycemia isn’t all in the mind, however. Recognized or not,
something is going on physiologically. Hypoglycemia isn’t some
unfortunate fad (such as a bad haircut) that people choose so that
they can stand apart from the crowd or gain sympathy. No wounds
or scars may be visible, but the suffering is all too real.
Because hypoglycemia is a legitimate condition, the sufferer needs
you to offer encouragement, sympathy, and support. You can show
your support in the following ways:
 Become an advocate. Your loved one needs you, especially
during hypoglycemic attacks, when the person is unable to
think clearly. (These attacks are usually a result of forgetting
to eat.) Again, remind yourself that it’s the low blood sugar,
not the sufferer, that’s the problem.
 Point out to your loved one which symptoms have disap-
peared. When hypoglycemics feel discouraged, feel that they
aren’t healing fast enough, or feel that their diet isn’t working,
forgetting how things used to be is easy. Because most people
have a tendency to concentrate on the negative — or on the
symptoms that they continue to have — they may not notice
that some of their symptoms have disappeared. Encourage
your loved one to fill out the self-questionnaire in Chapter 5 if
she hasn’t already done so. Keep a copy of her completed
questionnaire so that you can refer to it from time to time and
remind her of how she used to be (and of how far she’s come).
 Offer words of encouragement. The following list includes
some words of encouragement that you can give to someone
who’s working to control her hypoglycemia:
• “You’re on the right track.”
• “You’re doing great.”
• “I’m so proud of you.”
• “You’re so much better than you used to be.”
Chapter 14: Suffering Along with Your Sweetie? 239

• “Remember how you used to be? You’ve come a long
way (baby).”
• “Have you noticed that you’re no longer suffering from
[insert specific symptom here]?”
Stopping negative talk
One big drawback to suffering from hypoglycemia is that it’s just
not widely understood. It doesn’t seem quite as legitimate as some
of the more serious illnesses or disorders, such as cancer or dia-
betes, particularly because the medical profession generally doesn’t
recognize it. Lab tests, discussed in Chapter 5, can’t always give a
proper diagnosis of hypoglycemia. Because hypoglycemia has such
a vast array of puzzling symptoms, it can feel like an anything-goes,
catch-all syndrome — hardly something to take seriously.
If you want to show that you care and that you understand the full
ramifications of low blood sugar, avoid these negative statements:
 “Snap out of it.”
 “Grow up.”
 “You’re crazy.”
 “It’s all in your head.”
 “What’s your problem?”
 “Why can’t you be like everyone else?”
Low blood sugar or not, refrain from negative comments, because
they may make the other person defensive, leading her to shut down
communication. Negative comments definitely aren’t for nurturing a
relationship. But if you do slip, don’t be hard on yourself. The vast
majority hasn’t achieved sainthood yet, so just apologize and let it
go. Don’t let yourself engage in an escalating battle of blame.
Keep in mind that making dietary and lifestyle changes is difficult.
You’re bound to experience plateaus and what may appear to be
setbacks. Low blood sugar sufferers — who are probably prone to
be sensitive anyway — may feel quite discouraged.
To get everyone in the family on the same page, you may consider
calling a family meeting. Lay down some basic do’s and don’ts,
such as comments that should be avoided or things that family
members can do to support the hypoglycemic person. Make sure
that no one in the family makes comments such as these:
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
240

 “C’mon, one bite won’t hurt you.” (No, but it can trigger a full-
blown binge.)
 “Just start tomorrow.” (And tomorrow and tomorrow . . .)
 “It’s a holiday.” (Or your birthday, or your anniversary, or the
first day of the rest of your life. . . . The body doesn’t care
what occasion it is.)
 “What are you being so strict for? You don’t need to lose
weight.” (The diet isn’t about losing weight.)
 “You’ll get sick if you don’t eat.” (Eating the wrong foods will
make hypoglycemics sick, too.)
 “What a scrumptious dessert!” (It’s nothing compared to the
scrumptiously debilitating side effects the hypoglycemic will
get from eating it.)
 “Don’t tell me you’re still trying to follow that crazy diet!”
(What’s crazy is the persistence of eating foods that cause
distress to the hypoglycemic’s metabolism — not to mention
his life.)
 “What are you, some kind of health nut?” (Would you say that
to a diabetic who has to watch his diet?)
Offering Your Offspring Support
As a parent, it’s up to you to figure out whether your child is hypo-
glycemic. Children can’t be expected to accurately fill out the self-
survey questionnaire (see Chapter 5) for themselves. Observe
your child closely. Answer the questions on his behalf.
If your child shows symptoms of low blood sugar, consult a physi-
cian. (Chapter 3 gives a list of common symptoms. Flip to Chapter
4 for advice on choosing a healthcare professional.)
Keep in mind these do’s and don’ts when giving your child (or
grandchild) support with his hypoglycemia:
 Do encourage your child to stay on track. Children may need
more encouragement than adults to stay on a particular diet
and nutrition plan. Cutting out excess sugar and fat, and junk
foods in general, may be very difficult.
 Do make the changes gradually. Offer lots of love and sup-
port. Never threaten or belittle him, or make him feel like
hypoglycemia is somehow his fault. It isn’t.
 Do reward your child. Give children non-food rewards for
sticking to the plan. Once in a great while, it may be okay to
Chapter 14: Suffering Along with Your Sweetie? 241

go off that plan as a special treat. Use your best judgment
based on your child’s particular situation.
 Don’t assume that your child will eventually grow out of it.
If you leave the dysfunction uncorrected, it’s liable to get
worse. Low blood sugar in a child’s formative years can be
even more damaging than blood sugar imbalance in an adult.
Symptoms of hypoglycemia may impair your child’s ability
and motivation to learn and do well in school.
 Don’t make a hypoglycemic child feel isolated, different, or
“afflicted.” Explain why good eating habits are important.
Find healthy snacks the child can enjoy. (Flip to Chapter 6 for
some suggestions.) Find the time to bake some healthy
desserts for him if at all possible. It can boost morale enor-
mously if everyone in the family follows a (mostly) hypo-
glycemic diet. A hypoglycemia-aware diet can be very healthy
for everyone in the family, with only a few adjustments here
and there for individual differences among family members.
Jumping In with Both Feet (and
2.5 Kids, a Dog, and a Cat)
The lifestyle changes in this book can benefit anyone. Today, most
everyone suffers from stress and requires some form of exercise,
and no one can function forever without proper rest and relax-
ation. Having a low blood sugar sufferer in your family (or your
circle of friends) may be just the wake-up call you need. Take this
opportunity to review your life, your diet, and your priorities.
Part IV: Spinning a Network of Support for Yourself (and Others) 
242
Easy does it
Hey, don’t let the prospect of a “lifestyle review” overwhelm or intimidate you. Even
one or two small changes can work wonders when you consistently and diligently
apply them. Whatever you do, have compassion, both for yourself and for the suf-
ferer of low blood sugar. Just don’t stress yourself out even more in a Herculean
attempt to change everything at once. Easy does it.
Think of ways to make lifestyle changes pleasurable instead of treating them like
chores or duties. For example, have fun, spend time with your family, and get a good
workout by engaging in a group outdoor activity such as hiking or cycling. Or you can
motivate both yourself and the person with hypoglycemia by buddying up with him
and exercising together. (Flip to Chapter 8 for more about exercise and its benefits.)

Turn the healing and recovery project into a family affair. That may
bring you closer together and enable the affected person to recover
that much more quickly. For example, assign someone to remind the
hypoglycemic to eat regularly every one-and-a-half to two hours.
Here are some other possible ways to get the family involved:
 Openly discuss your feelings, especially if you have any con-
cerns or reservations. Do you feel threatened? Criticized?
Made to feel wrong? Share what you think and how you feel
among your friends and family, especially including others
who also suffer from low blood sugar.
 Turn the challenge of making dietary and lifestyle modifica-
tions into a game. The way back to health doesn’t have to be
solemn, painful, hard work. Brainstorm with family and
friends about ways to make the changes more fun, and there-
fore easier to stick to.
For example, you may have a drawing or lottery to determine
who does the different cooking and household chores. Or
whip up new recipes that fit into your new diet and nutrition
plan. Be creative! If you have kids, don’t leave them out.
 Show solidarity and support, but don’t let the hypoglycemic
act like a drama queen. If she does flaunt an air of unspeak-
able sorrow, gently remind her that everyone has a cross to
bear, but you’re happy to help share some of the burden.
 Have a sense of humor. Take the journey to health with
humor, and take it as lightly as you can, but don’t pull a long
face and become morbidly serious.
Family members often resist change out of ignorance or fear. This
resistance is very natural, and very human. Be as supportive as
possible to help everyone adapt to the situation.
You Be Betty Crocker and
I’ll Be Julia Child
When you live with a hypoglycemic, mealtime can’t be slapdash or
free-form. Don’t just veg out in front of the TV with a bag of chips.
And you shouldn’t just order a pizza (although you can make a
healthier homemade version).
To help make mealtime less stressful, we suggest you try the
following:
Chapter 14: Suffering Along with Your Sweetie? 243

 Make shopping for and cooking healthy food a family affair.
Eating junk food is never a good idea. You have to put more
thought into cooking and grocery shopping. Adults can take
turns shopping and cooking for healthy food. If you have chil-
dren, they can contribute according to their age and ability.
 Establish a regular routine. Figure out a schedule for perform-
ing all meal-related activities, such as buying groceries (you
may see whether you can have the groceries delivered if that
makes life easier), freezing appropriate food items, and cook-
ing. Also establish who’s responsible for what. Write out every-
thing on paper (try using a spreadsheet) and put it in the
kitchen or somewhere easily visible and accessible. After you
create and settle into a routine, meal preparation shouldn’t take
an unusually long time. Meals and meal preparation can be fun
if everyone in the family pitches in.
 Serve meals on a regular schedule. Otherwise, your family
member’s blood sugar may drop too low, and you may have
one easily upset person as a result.
 Have everyone in the family eat the same healthy food.
Adopting the same changes makes everything so much
simpler — not to mention healthier — for the whole family!
Of course, you don’t have to eat as frequently as the hypo-
glycemic. You may want to stick to three average-size meals,
and maybe one snack. Note that average-size meals aren’t
restaurant-size portions of food, which are typically too large.
You most likely share just one or two meals a day with the res-
ident hypoglycemic. (If you don’t suffer from low blood sugar,
you don’t have to restrict your carb intake quite as much. You
can consume 50 to 60 percent of your daily caloric intake in
the form of complex carbs.)
 If you, the non-hypoglycemic, decide to occasionally eat
foods that are off limits to your loved one, don’t flaunt it.
Don’t eat off-limit foods too often, and don’t do so in front of
the hypoglycemic. Remember, tempt not, taunt not, flaunt not.
Your beloved hypoglycemic will appreciate your considera-
tion, and you’ll likely enjoy peace of mind. Do unto others as
you would have them do unto you. Changing your diet and
sticking to a nutrition plan is hard enough without having
temptation thrust in your face!
 Be creative and ingenious. Use your imagination to find
arrangements that work best for all concerned. If you’re
adamant about sticking to your own diet, plan as much as
possible for some common mealtime together. For example,
everyone needs healthy helpings of greens, so include greens
(lots of greens!) among the dishes you both eat.

Hypoglycemia

H
ypoglycemia is a condition that many doctors don’t com-
pletely understand. In fact, some doctors even think that
hypoglycemia isn’t a real disease. Despite all the misunderstandings
about hypoglycemia, the condition is real. (You know it if you suffer
from it, right?)
This fun chapter debunks some common myths and misconcep-
tions people have about hypoglycemia. Arm yourself with this info
the next time some nonbeliever questions your condition.
Hypoglycemia Doesn’t Exist
The truth is that hypoglycemia is a very real condition — all too
real, in fact, for anyone who suffers from it. It should be taken seri-
ously and treated just like any other health issue. People who
assert that hypoglycemia doesn’t exist or who use a definition
that’s too narrow leave hundreds of sufferers out in the cold.
Perhaps “hypoglycemia” isn’t the best term to use because you may
not suffer from low blood sugar as defined by the medical profes-
sion. (The speed at which the blood sugar drops is just as impor-
tant. Chapter 5 provides details on how to diagnose hypoglycemia.)
Yet, despite what blood sugar measurements may indicate, the fact
is that people are afflicted with physical and emotional symptoms
characteristic of hypoglycemia. It isn’t a “fad disease” or a bogus
diagnosis.

If the word hypoglycemia seems to elicit a dismissive shrug or a
look of disbelief from most people, then feel free to use more
descriptive (if not necessarily more accurate) terms like blood
sugar imbalance caused by insulin dysfunction, carbohydrate intoler-
ance syndrome, or a metabolic dysfunction precipitated by inappro-
priate carbohydrate ingestion.
Hypoglycemics Lack Willpower
Even when people acknowledge that hypoglycemia is a physical
disorder, because it isn’t something that they can point at or see,
they have a tendency to regard its manifestations as simply the
result of your overactive imagination. If you have a headache or
feel weak, shaky, or dizzy, people may suspect you of malingering,
especially if you’re too ill to work.
People with hypertension can’t normalize their blood pressure
simply by willing their blood pressure to drop. By the same token,
no one can achieve good blood sugar or hormonal balance by dint
of sheer willpower. But some people have an assumption that you
should be able to turn off symptoms and discomforts — especially
if they’re of an emotional rather than physical nature — by the
strength of your mind power.
That’s not realistic, and it’s simply not possible. But you can take
control of your life by gradually changing to a better diet and
making any adjustments that you need to live a healthier, happier
life. (Check out Chapter 6 for how you can eat a better diet.)
Eating Sugar Is a Quick Fix
If you believe that eating sugar is a quick fix for hypoglycemia, we
want to offer you a training course guaranteed to make you a mil-
lionaire in just three months working from your home. That’s not a
likely scenario. And thinking that sugar will cure the low blood
sugar blues is just as fanciful.
But why can’t you just eat sugar if you don’t have enough of it
circulating in your bloodstream? In fact, eating something sweet
quickly elevates the blood sugar level. And in an emergency situa-
tion, that’s exactly what’s required. Diabetics suffering from hypo-
glycemic shock take glucose tablets, drink orange juice, or eat a
piece of candy — anything to pump up the blood sugar as quickly
as possible.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
248

However, an emergency situation is vastly different than a day-to-
day scenario. Living a healthy lifestyle is a totally different story.
You simply can’t recover from hypoglycemia and become truly
healthy if you continue to eat sugar and simple carbohydrates. If
you do, the same old tiresome symptoms will keep popping up on
your screen like bad reruns. Instead, choose complex, slow-release
carbohydrates over trigger-happy, simple starches to keep your
blood sugar balanced. (Check out Chapter 6 for more info on
eating a healthful diet.)
One Diet Fits All
A nutritional plan that says that everyone must eat exactly the
same way all the time isn’t a good plan. Each person has different
requirements, although just about everyone can make positive
changes in his or her nutritional plan.
Even for hypoglycemics, there isn’t one optimal diet that will put
your health back on track. Some people benefit from a low-carbo-
hydrate, high-protein diet, while others do much better eating a
high-carbohydrate, low-protein diet. People benefit from different
eating plans because everyone has a unique biochemistry.
Additionally, many people suffer from not only hypoglycemia, but
also other associated conditions. For example, people who are
allergic to wheat have to stay away from all foods containing
wheat. There are, however, some food commandments that every-
one must follow. Check out Chapter 6 for all the details. Stay away
from sugar in all forms. And eat your vegetables.
Eliminating the “Bad” Foods
Is All You Have to Do
Some people think that all you have to do is cut out the foods that
trigger an overproduction of insulin. By avoiding foods that jack up
the blood sugar too quickly, you won’t experience a calamitous
drop in blood sugar — it may seem as if your immediate problems
are resolved.
But without eating the right foods and getting the nutrients that
you need, you won’t experience optimal health or a sense of well-
being that comes from radiant health. Over the long term, you may
even discover some of your old symptoms returning.
Chapter 15: Ten Myths about Hypoglycemia 249

Speaking of elimination, another, often overlooked, ingredient
should be included in the diet for people with blood sugar imbal-
ances: fiber. Fiber helps with regular bowel movements. It’s impor-
tant in the prevention of constipation, varicose veins,
hemorrhoids, and possibly colon cancers. The recommended
intake is 25 to 35 grams (some experts suggest going as high as 50
grams), but the average person gets only about 11 grams per day.
Adding the right supplements is beneficial too, particularly as you
get older. (Chapter 7 has recommendations on what to take.)
You Can’t Be a Vegetarian if
You’re Hypoglycemic
People often say that being a vegetarian isn’t possible if you suffer
from hypoglycemia. They’re presumably thinking about the often-
heightened requirement for protein. But if you happen to be a vege-
tarian, you can still get enough protein. You don’t even have to
worry about combining the right foods to get all the amino acids
you need in one sitting. Just try to include the following in your diet:
 A wide variety of vegetables
 Nuts
 Seeds
 Unrefined grains
 Soy products. They make good meat substitutes, but don’t try
to meet your protein needs solely through soy. (Flip to
Chapter 6 for more on soy.)
 Natto. These sticky, fermented beans are a great vegetarian
source of protein that are also rich in B-12, a vitamin that’s
usually missing from the vegetarian diet. In Japan, natto is
often eaten over rice for breakfast. The one drawback to natto
is its strong odor, which takes some getting used to.
When you’re buying imitation meat products, be sure you check
the labels for MSG, because it can derail your recovery. And
depending on the brand, imitation meat may contain more carbs
than protein.
Having a “Cheat Day” Is Okay
Some people ask about having a “cheat” day — a day you can go
off your diet and eat anything you want. Because the hypoglycemia
Part V: The Part of Tens 
250

diet is designed to correct and prevent blood sugar imbalance, a
day where you go off the diet doesn’t make much sense. Unless of
course you want to have a day where you throw progress to the
wind and experience the joys of your body going haywire again.
After you have a solid recovery, you can occasionally eat foods
that are on the forbidden list. But an entire day where you eat any-
thing you want at all will likely make you very ill.
If you just have to have sweets, make sure you eat some protein
with them to slow down the sugar’s entry into your bloodstream.
And make sure that you’re exercising enough — studies have
shown that exercise can help reduce cravings for sugar.
Sugar Can Be Part
of a Healthful Diet
Sugar can and is part of many people’s diet — in fact, the vast
majority of people in developed countries eat sugar. But it most
definitely can’t be a part of a healthful diet. Humans (some individ-
uals more than others) are genetically predisposed to like sweet
taste. But people aren’t genetically built to consume several tons
of sugar a year. Nor are humans pre-programmed to require an
infusion of cookies or cream-filled cakes.
Sure, a little bit of sugar won’t kill you. When you’re in good health,
you can occasionally eat some sugar now and then, but you prob-
ably won’t even like sweets the way you used to. You have to watch
out if you’re a sugar addict, because even a little bit can hook you
back in. Saying that a little bit of sugar is okay is like telling an alco-
holic that one drink won’t hurt him.
If you continue to have cravings for sugar and other foods that are
off limits, you may be deficient in one or more nutrients. For exam-
ple, a craving for chocolate may indicate a lack of magnesium.
Refer to a table created by Dr. Colleen Huber showing what you
may be missing and what foods or supplements you can take at
www.naturopathyworks.com/pages/cravings.php.
Hypoglycemics Should Eat 
Low-Fat Diets
For most people, eating an extremely low-fat diet is difficult to sus-
tain and may lead to overeating. Fat is particularly important to
Chapter 15: Ten Myths about Hypoglycemia 251

anyone prone to low blood sugar. As Dr. Carolyn Dean, a physician
who treats patients with chronic conditions, explains, “Sugar and
fruit burn like paper; complex carbs burn like kindling; but fats burn
like coal — lasting the longest and keeping your blood sugar up.”
Dropping fat to lower than 20 percent of your total calorie intake
makes sustaining balanced blood sugar and athletic performance
more difficult. For most people, somewhere between 20 to 40 per-
cent is the right range. Rather than the amount of fat, what you
should be concerned about is the kind of fat you’re eating.
Experts advise getting a variety of different oils. Try to get some
monosaturates, like olive oil, and polyunsaturates, like flax oil.
Omega-3 fatty fish oil is particularly relevant to anyone with blood
sugar issues because the oil has a direct impact on how sensitive
the cells are to insulin.
The fats that cause the greatest problems are trans fats, or partially
hydrogenated oil. Trans fats appear in most packaged foods and
are often lurking in restaurant foods. So how much trans fats do
you need? Zero to none. Better cook at home, because most people
get their trans fats from restaurants.
Don’t be misled by labels that claim no trans fats. The ingredients
may show some hidden trans fats. Even small amounts can quickly
add up.
Blood Glucose Levels Remain the
Same throughout the Day
Many patients think that blood sugar levels are the same no matter
what time of the day it is — and that, moreover, they have to ensure
that their glucose levels stay exactly the same all the time. In fact,
everyone’s blood sugar level has normal variations. Your aim is to
keep your blood sugar fairly stable and avoid wide swings that can
cause uncomfortable symptoms. But you can’t — and don’t need
to — attempt to eliminate normal fluctuations in glucose levels.
You’ll find that your blood sugar is at the lowest before meals —
this is why doctors urge hypoglycemics to eat frequently, and not
go longer than three hours between meals and snacks. You should
also eat a small snack before going to bed so your blood sugar
doesn’t drop too low in the middle of the night. To avoid weight
gain, keep the calories low.

Hypoglycemics
In This Chapter
 Making changes to your diet and lifestyle
 Improving the performance of your brain
M
aybe you’re feeling like a sourpuss because, when it comes
to hypoglycemia, you have so much to be careful about.
Dealing with hypoglycemia may seem daunting, but it’s nothing
you can’t handle. You’ll see for yourself that “doing” is indeed
easier than “thinking about doing.”
With the tips compiled in this chapter, you don’t have to be hyper-
vigilant about your hypoglycemia. Besides, most of the dietary and
lifestyle changes are good for you regardless of whether you have
hypoglycemia.
Acting Practically at Home
Okay, so you have to work, eat, sleep, pay bills, do the laundry, and
spend some quality time with those you love. Try to incorporate
these things into what free time you have:
 Keep a list of foods to eat and foods to avoid on the fridge.
Carry a copy of the list with you wherever you go so that you
can refer to it often. Chapter 6 gives further food fodder.
 Be prepared for emergencies. Don’t go anywhere without
food. Keep utensils, paper towels, and several coolers in your
car, or bring a tote bag full of snacks. Keep the coolers supplied
with several days’ worth of food when you go on road trips.
 Review your food journal every week. Make any necessary
adjustments to your food plan. (Chapter 6 gives info on
journaling.)

 Ventilate your house. If the air in your house is stagnant, stir
it up with electric fans. You may also want to install an attic
fan. Avoid using air fresheners.
Testing for Sugar
To eat or not to eat? Ah, what a dilemma! When eating out, you
can’t always tell whether a dish has sugar; the server may not
know, either.
Diabetes expert Dr. Richard Bernstein recommends carrying some
Clinistix or Diastix (available at most pharmacies) to detect the
presence of sugar or flour in packaged or restaurant foods. They’re
actually marketed for testing urine — but not to fear, he’s not
asking you to pee right at the table. To use these test strips for
testing food, follow these steps:
1. Put a small amount of food in your mouth.
2. Swish it or chew it around a bit so that it mixes with your
saliva.
3. Spit a tiny bit onto a test strip.
The strip will change color if your food contains sugar. The
darker the color, the more sugar it contains. The test strips
will work on nearly all foods except milk products, which
contain lactose. They also won’t react with fructose.
Your loved ones are probably so used to your strange rituals involv-
ing food that they won’t even blink when you conduct this test. But
if you’re dining with business associates, perform the test in the
bathroom or just skip it altogether and order only tried-and-true
dishes. Grilled or broiled meat and fish are safe bets. You can order
some steamed vegetables, or you can have salad with oil and vin-
egar (because most dressings contain sugar). If you can’t have 
vinegar, sprinkle some lemon juice and a dash of salt on your salad.
Controlling Blood Sugar
Diabetics use glucose tablets to raise their blood sugar, but some 
low blood sugar sufferers report that glucose tabs help them, too. To
keep your blood sugar from dipping too low, eat more frequently —
and carry some snacks with you.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
254

Use glucose tabs with discretion. Taking them may put you in
danger of a rebound drop in blood sugar. In other words, your
body may produce too much insulin in response to the sugar,
which in turn can cause your blood sugar to fall too low. Carry the
tabs with you in case of emergencies and use them only
 When you have very severe symptoms
 If you eat some protein within 20 minutes of taking them
Because glucose doesn’t have to be digested, the tablets can raise
your blood sugar rapidly with a predictable outcome. Dr. Bernstein
recommends Dextrotabs because they’re inexpensive, conveniently
packaged, and very easy to chew. Dextrotabs begin raising your
blood sugar in about 3 minutes and stop raising it after about
40 minutes.
One point to bear in mind is that even if your blood sugar isn’t too
low, you may still have symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as a rapid
heart rate, anxiety, tremors, and so on. If you wait a bit, they
should abate.
Refrain from consuming too much during meals or snacks to avoid
triggering too large an insulin response, which plays havoc with
your blood sugar regulation. If you often feel hungry even after a rea-
sonable meal, try finishing your meal with something that contains
fat, because it tends to satisfy your appetite more. You may have a
few slices of avocado or salad with lots of dressing. (Read the labels!
Many brands contain sugar.) Also, if you’re constantly hungry, you
may not be getting enough of the right nutrients. You shouldn’t get
so hungry if you’re eating frequent snacks. Review your diet and
take some vitamins. (Check out Chapters 6 and 7 for more.)
Dining Out: The Do’s and Don’ts
Who doesn’t eat out once in a while? Eating at a restaurant or a
friend’s home doesn’t need to spell disaster. Although you can’t
have your cake and eat it too (no cake allowed on the food plan,
unless it’s homemade without sugar or refined flour), you can
follow these simple guidelines to help manage your diet:
 About half an hour before going to a restaurant, eat a light
snack. You never know how long you’ll have to wait.
 Tell the server about your allergies, sensitivities, and dietary
restrictions, and don’t be afraid to request modifications or
substitutions.
Chapter 16: Ten Hints for Helping Hypoglycemics 255

 Stay away from white rice, white bread, noodles, anything
with sauces, chips, bean paste, barbecued meats, sweet and
sour foods, meatloaf (it often contains sugar or sweetener),
casseroles (no telling what ingredients are in them), and any-
thing deep fried. (More on foods to avoid in Chapter 6.)
 Because you’re now eating smaller meals, most restaurant
servings will be too large. To prevent overeating, measure out
the amount you’re going to eat and put the rest away in a
doggie bag. Most restaurants in the United States serve such
humongous portions that you can easily get three meals out
of a single entrée. Think of all the money you’re saving!
 Try ordering several appetizers instead of an entrée. It’s a fun
way to create a balanced meal. When ordering soups, be
aware that they may be loaded with sugar.
 When your friends invite you to dinner, make your restrictions
known but be gracious about it. Don’t insist that they accom-
modate you.
• Offer to bring a dish to share — something you can defi-
nitely eat.
• Refuse politely when your host urges you to eat some-
thing you can’t.
• Don’t be uncertain or apologetic.
• Don’t moan about your food restrictions, or your host
may feel compelled to talk you into eating things that are
off-limits.
 If everyone’s having dessert and you’re tempted beyond
reason, order a sweet fruit (or bring some with you).
• If it’s winter and you’re cold, get a cup of tea and
sweeten it with stevia, a natural low-carbohydrate
sweetener. Carry several packets with you. (Some hypo-
glycemics can’t tolerate stevia, because it can lower
blood sugar. Try it out at home and see whether your
body can handle it.)
• If all else fails, and you have to have a “real” dessert, get
a bite from someone or share an order.
 You may find that there are times, such as special occasions,
when you just have to have forbidden foods. In this case, you
can go off your program, but make sure that you
• Plan ahead — and be willing to pay the consequences.
• Don’t go off your program at a stressful time in your
life — stress can aggravate hypoglycemia.
• Don’t go off your program for too long.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
256

• Always eat some protein to offset any sugar and concen-
trated carbs that you may eat.
 When staying with friends or relatives over a period of time,
you may be able to make special requests if you have a close
enough relationship with them. Otherwise, do what you can
without imposing. Chapter 6 tells you more about diet, and
Chapters 13 and 14 tell you how to live with a hypoglycemic.
No matter what, be a considerate, gracious guest.
Food Facts for Tasty Health
Research is turning up more hard-core data about just how good
certain foods (of course, we’re talking natural stuff, like veggies
and fruits, not prepackaged edibles) can be for your mind and
body. In some cases, food can work like medicine — and it’s prob-
ably the best-tasting medicine there is! The following facts about
food can help you create a healthier diet:
 Unless you’re cooking for an army, get smaller bottles of
cooking oil. Add a capsule of vitamin E to the oil to help pre-
vent oxidation, and throw out any oil that’s been sitting for
more than four months.
 Use potato flour, barley flour, arrow root flour, oat flour,
rice flour, or kuzu for thickening (replacing cornstarch). If
you’re allergic to corn, avoid cornstarch.
 Definitely add milled flaxseed to your diet. It promotes
healthy sugar metabolism by slowing down sugar absorption.
Its high fiber content helps keep you regular. It’s also a boon
to anyone at risk of type 2 diabetes. On top of that, it supports
your immune system.
 Remove starch from some of your favorite foods. To remove
some of the starch from potatoes, cut them up and soak them
in water overnight, and then drain them. To remove some
starch from your oatmeal, cook it in twice the amount of
water required, and then pour it through a strainer.
 Eat an apple (or onion) a day. Anyone with a blood sugar dis-
order should heed this advice. Apples and onions are rich in
quercetin (a flavonoid, potent antioxidants found in most
plants), which lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes,
stroke, lung cancer, heart disease, and asthma.
 Eat more fruits (if you can tolerate them). Fruits are good for
you. The darkest fruits, such as black or red grapes, are the
richest in antioxidants, which help detoxify the body. Berries
are also packed with antioxidants.
Chapter 16: Ten Hints for Helping Hypoglycemics 257

 Consume almonds and turkey. They not only provide protein,
but they’re also excellent sources of vitamin B6. This vitamin
plays an important role in the synthesis of serotonin (the neuro-
transmitter that makes you feel calmer and happier).
 Toast some seaweed. Toasted nori (seaweed), which is avail-
able in Asian markets, is high in nutrients and very low in
calories. It’s also good for sluggish thyroids. Eating kelp and
seaweed daily for at least a month will help regulate your
thyroid.
 Enjoy some sweet taste without unduly raising your blood
sugar. Add protein shake powder to plain, full-fat yogurt, and
sweeten with stevia, if you can tolerate this natural sweetener.
Or mix fruit-sweetened jam with some creamed cottage cheese.
Be sure to get yogurt and cottage cheese with active cultures,
because they may help grow beneficial bacteria in your 
intestines.
Noshing on Nourishment
Vegetables make excellent nutrient-packed snacks. Make sure that
you have a good supply of raw vegetables, such as broccoli, cauli-
flower, cucumbers, celery, and bell peppers, washed and cut into
finger-sized pieces. For added flavor, dip them in red or white miso
paste, or drizzle a little bit of salad dressing on them. You can
make a healthy salad dressing by combining extra virgin olive oil
with balsamic vinegar. Or try spreading nut butter, such as almond
or cashew, on the vegetables. Although not conclusive, some
research suggests that the unsaturated fats in nuts may help regu-
late blood sugar. However, be cautious about eating too much,
because nuts are high in calories and can cause weight gain. Seeds
are rich in protein, but somewhat less fattening than nuts. Some
vegetables, nuts, and seeds that you may want to try are
 Leafy vegetables (such as kale or collards): These vegetables
can be cooked very quickly. Put them in a pot with just
enough water to cover them. Boil for 3 or 4 minutes. Drain and
freeze individual portions in baggies.
You can also keep individual portions of leafy green salads
(also rich in vitamin E) in the fridge for snacking. Don’t add
the salad dressing until just before you eat.
 Salted green soybeans (edamame): They’re usually found
frozen in Asian supermarkets. Cook them in boiling water for
five minutes and drain. Cool them under running water before
eating, or refrigerate and serve chilled.
 Artichokes: Steam or boil for about 45 minutes. You may want
to try them with low-fat salsa or other dips you enjoy.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
258

 Brussels sprouts: Like other members of the cruciferous
family (like broccoli), they’re thought to fight cancer. You can
steam them, or boil them, covered, for eight to ten minutes,
until they’re slightly tender but still crisp.
 Almonds: They have vitamins that play an important role in
the synthesis of serotonin, the neurotransmitter that helps
you feel happy. Other good serotonin-boosters are tomatoes,
eggplants, and walnuts.
 Raw walnuts and pumpkin seeds: These are great sources of
Omega-3 fatty acids, which modern diets are very low in. If you
get tired of eating plain, raw pumpkin seeds, try Pumpkorn
(seasoned pumpkin seeds), found in natural food stores.
Eating Brainy Foods
Did you know that the brain is made up of 60 percent fat? No kid-
ding! If that was your body fat percentage, you’d be considered
obese! The following nutrients can help your gray matter:
 Vitamin E: The brain is susceptible to harmful oxidation (a
process that damages cells and genes). Taking plenty of vita-
min E helps slow down oxidation and reduce memory loss.
Brussels sprouts and avocados are good sources of vitamin E.
 Omega-3 fatty acids: You can find Omega-3 fatty acids in fatty
fish, such as salmon, sardines, herring, mackerel, and
anchovies. They help your body build more brain cells. Eating
fish three to four times a week not only boosts your brain
power but also lifts your mood. If you’re a vegan, take one or
two teaspoons of flax oil five times a week. Flax oil is also rich
in Omega-3, so use it instead of butter on your bread, or add it
to your salad.
 Folate: Legumes and green vegetables hold lots of folate,
which is a B vitamin. All the B vitamins are very important in
brain development and cognitive health.
Banishing Brain Fog
The fog that just rolled in isn’t outside the window. It’s in your
head. And the worst part is that because you can’t think clearly,
you can’t quite figure out what to do. Fortunately, you can take
action to alleviate the problem. Try the following suggestions and
see whether one, or a combination of them, works for you:
 Chew gum: Chewing gum may stimulate and improve your
short-term memory. Studies have shown an increase in the
Chapter 16: Ten Hints for Helping Hypoglycemics 259

activity of the hippocampus (the area of the brain where new
memories are stored) when people chew gum.
 Use ozone air-purification machines regularly: They’re a
boon to people who live or work in places with airborne pollu-
tants, fumes, mold, mildew, and so on. You can get a portable
machine for home use. You’ll start to notice the benefits after
two to three weeks.
 Eat nutritious foods: Nutritious foods not only enhance your
memory and learning but they may also help dispel brain fog.
Nutritious foods include most kinds of vegetables, fruits (if
you can tolerate them), and some lean protein such as organic
chicken and beef.
 Kick caffeine: It gives you a temporary buzz, but in the long-
run, it aggravates your health condition. Rather than drinking
coffee, you may want to try drinking the South American herb
yerba mate, which can give you a lift without the coffee jitters.
 Take oral DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): If you can say
the word five times without stumbling, your brain’s doing
pretty good! DHEA is a steroid hormone. The concentration of
DHEA in the human body plummets as people age. Studies
suggest that DHEA improves memory and increases physical
and psychological well-being. A daily dose of 30 to 90 mg may
enhance the brain’s ability to process and store information.
 Shake, shake, shake your bod: Let all your limbs go loose and
roll your head freely while breathing naturally. Do it for any-
where from one to five minutes. It’s an old qigong exercise
that helps you relax and sweep away any cobwebs from your
mind. (Chapter 8 talks more about qigong.) Here’s another
exercise you can try:
1. Stand with your knees slightly bent and your feet
shoulder-width apart.
2. Bring your arms up, as if carrying a ball.
Your elbows should be rounded, and your palms
should face you. Your right and left fingertips should
almost touch.
3. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.
Imagine that you’re standing in a waterfall. Water is
running down your head, face, and body, clearing
your mind and cleaning your body.
4. Do this exercise for five minutes to an hour.
 Exercise your hands: One exercise you can try is “dry wash-
ing.” All you have to do is wring your hands, as though you’re
washing them, for one to five minutes. You can also hold golf

balls in your palms and then roll them with your fingers; or
you can just go through the motions empty-handed.
 Give yourself a pat on the face: Here’s an exercise adapted
from the Luohan Patting System of Yin Style Bagua (a school of
Chinese martial arts and healing). Don’t hit yourself too hard!
You don’t need to use a lot of force, just make it rhythmical.
1. Using cupped palms, slap your head from the front
to the back, and to the sides above your ears.
2. Lightly strike your forehead, temples, and cheeks.
3. Count 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3, and then pause
slightly before repeating the sequence.
(Or you can repeat, “Hot cross buns, hot cross buns,
1-2-3-4, hot cross buns.”)
 Laugh: Laughing out loud releases endorphins, which makes
you more alert and clears that foggy feeling. You don’t actu-
ally have to have anything to laugh about. Going through the
motions of laughing can provide you with the same benefits.
Remembering How to Deal with
Short-Term Memory Loss
The brain has a higher metabolic rate than other organs, so if it
isn’t getting enough oxygen, glucose, and other substances that
the brain cells need to function, your thinking may get fuzzy. You
may find yourself spending several hours every day looking for
misplaced items or forgetting things that should be second nature
to you, such as remembering to take your wallet with you.
The best way to deal with this short-term memory loss is to
 Write down everything that’s important. Keep a written
record for everything, such as credit card payments, health-
care information, and so on.
 Put lists everywhere. Make sure that you place them some-
place visible. Write appointments, messages, and reminders
on a wall calendar and a day planner.
 Give directions aloud. You may want to make sure that you’re
alone — or else pretend that you’re speaking to a cellphone.
Repeat the info you want to remember out loud several times.
 Keep important items somewhere visible. Make sure that you
place your medication and vitamins someplace where you can
see them. If you have items that you want to take with you when
you go out, put them in your car, in your bag, or by the door.
Chapter 16: Ten Hints for Helping Hypoglycemics 261

 Keep everything well organized. Go through files, drawers,
and closets. Do you have so much clutter that you don’t know
where to begin? Hire a professional organizer. If money is an
issue, get a friend or family member to help you.
 Keep chores and errands to an absolute minimum. Conserve
your energy for the essentials: making sure that you’re getting
enough nutrients, eating small meals, and exercising.
Changing Successfully
First, you step into a phone booth, then you rip off your . . . No, not
that kind of change. We’re talking about modifying your behavior
to attain a goal that’s important to you. And you don’t have to
transform yourself into a superhero in the blink of an eye, or over-
haul your lifestyle overnight.
The problem? Staying with the status quo is easier than changing a
long-standing habit or trying something new. Fortunately, after
studying human behavior, psychologists have outlined a course of
action that helps most anyone change successfully.
What follows is a simplified version of steps you can take to make
revising your diet and lifestyle easier:
 Take baby steps. Break down the target behavior (the new
behavior that you want to develop) into smaller, self-contained
units. For example, you can write down each step that’s
entailed in changing your diet to a healthy one. It may be to
start keeping a food journal, shopping for the right foods,
cooking more at home, and so on. Approach each step as a
separate mission (smaller goals that work toward the ultimate
goal) and reward yourself whenever you accomplish them.
 Identify elements in your environment that interfere with
your target behavior. After identifying what helps and what
hinders, keep or increase what helps, and eliminate anything
that hinders.
 Eliminate the wrong foods. This step is crucial in getting over
hypoglycemia. Some people may be able to go cold turkey by
giving up all their favorite foods and overhauling their lives
overnight. For most people, it’s much easier to change in
degrees. See Chapter 6 for more info on maintaining a good diet.
 Write down the consequences of continuing your current
behavior. Then write down all the benefits of reaching your
goal. When you have a concrete picture of the positive results
the new behavior can bring, you’ll be more motivated to
change to a healthier lifestyle.
