ell, we're here! Months of
planning have ﬁnally payed
off as the ﬁrst YC hits the
news stands, And what hove
•  we got planned?
Apart from the umpteen pages
of reviews, news, features, regulars
and FREE cassette containing 4
complete games (Finders Keepers
and Kentilla from Virgin Mastertronic,
and Spots and Microdot, two original
pieces) that we offer you this
month, future issues hove a lot more
in store.
The free cassette is now a
permanent feature, with games and
demos offered EVERY month.
EXCLUSIVE reviews will come your
way, along with up-to-the-minute
games news and previews. You'll
ﬁnd a free poster in the middle of
YC every issue. Interviews with
incredibly famous people will be a
regular occurrence, as will features
on shows, ﬁlms and other wild and
wacky subjects. And wonderful
competitions will beg you to win
unbelievable goodies.
I would also like to take the
opportunity to welcome new
Games Editor Adrian Pumphrey to
our team. Adrian is the ex-Deputy
Editor of Amstrad Computer User,
and the ex-Games Editor of Popular
Computing Weekly, so you can be
assured he'll be ﬁlling YC with some
excellent games material.
This also brings me onto another
point. At YC we can't have too much
of a good thing, so we're looking for
a Games Assistant to help Pumpy
with his tasks. He/she must be over
16, bright, witty, willing to work in on
insane environment, and above all
else, must enjoy playing games. If
you're interested drop Stuart Cooke
(the Group Editor of this amazing
title) a note, with a copy of your CV
attached, you never know, you
might end up being mode coffee
by me.
That about wraps it up for now,
all I can say is enjoy what you are
about to experience. If you don't,
well I've heard that train spatting is
an interesting way to while away
the hours...
Rik Henderson.

SHOW
Last month we said that the question goes begging as to what will
happen to the PC Show? Has it disappeared without trace or will it still
go ahead on another date or at a new venue?
This month it would appear that PC Show is now a thing of the past
as Montbuild announces that the Business Computing 90 exhibition will
be held from September 25 to 28 next year at Earls Court. This
effectively cuts out Montbuild's PC Show sponsors, publishing company
VNU. Montbuild did tell VNLI that they would not be willing to stage the
Show again and VNU has replied by suing Montbuild for E5 million.
It seems that the new show will be so boring that only the trade will
be allowed to attend Gentlemen of the Press ore also invited so you
can be sure we won't be going.

Did you know that video screens may cause
cancer and early aging of the skin? Colour screens
give off radiation and ultra-violet rays which can
harm those who need to work close to the
screen.
Data Sound is the latest company to point out
these disadvantages as a vehicle to selling its
anti-glare VDU screen which sticks to the front of a
monitor and cuts back the harmful rays. Isn't it
about time that the Government acted to make
unprotected screens illegal? Until they do,
concerned users will have to shell Out 689 or so to
avoid eye-strain at the very least.

Microprose seem to be as busy as US Gold were in the old days. Release upon release
can be expected in the run up to Christmas and into the New Year.
This VIC:15 the US Gold policy in the old days until the powers that be decided that
the games were competing with each other and effectively cutting the company's
proﬁts. Part of Microprose's problem is having to support so many labels (in fact, more
labels than the Editors travel bag).
Almost as intricate as the inner workings of Microprose is the Rainbird label's
Betrayal which was previously ﬂagged as Epoch. The game is ideal for amateur
megalomaniacs who would like to get their minds attuned to economic, political and
military control of a small country with big aspirations. An investment of E14.99 for a
cassette or f-19.99 for disk will bring the world to your knees.
On the eponymous Microprose label Airborne Ranger's long awaited successor, Rot
Pack, is expected to appear in eady Spring and promises a weighty tome under the
guise of an instruction manual. If your 'situational awareness' needs an awakening, this
could be for you.
Just before Rat Pack we should be seeing the company's ﬁrst space simulation,
StarLord. based on a PBM (play by mail) game which Mike Singleton masterminded in
the early 19805 before he discovered programming.
Meanwhile, Firebird is working on Oriental Games which is a compendium of four
ﬁghting styles in one game: Kung Fu, Hollywood Rules, Sumo Wrestling, and Kenda

four ployers, although the game
allows the computer to play
any or all of these players.
Brief instructions are included in the
game and a more derailed
explanation is included below The
game is similar to some commercial
dice games but uses more dice and
slightly different rules that increase
the strategy element of the game.
Play involves initially rolling six
dice and subsequently choosing to
hold on to or roll, any or all of them
in up_to a maximum of three further
throws. The aim of each throw is to
try to use the dice to make one of a
number of scoring patterns. Thus the
skill lies partly in choosing which dice
to hold on to and which to rethrow,
and partly in deciding how best to
score the result.
There ore fourteen patterns or
categories that a player may aim
for and these are listed on a score-
card at the side of the playing area.
On completion of each throw a
score must be entered in one of
these categories, even if the dice do
not complete the chosen pattern in
which case the score for that
category will be zero. So a
complete game consists of fourteen
rounds, each player ﬁlling one
category on his score-card each
round,
The fourteen categories con be
broken down as folows. The ﬁrst six
are the number categories "ONES"
to "SIXES" and are used to score any
pattern of dice that contains any
dice of the selected value (ONES=1,
IWOS=2...) t he score in each case
is the sum of the spots on these dice.
For example the dice pattern 66 1
4 6 4 would score 1x1 =1 point in
"ONES", 2x4=8 points in "FOURS"
and 3x6=18 in "SIXES". If the pattern
contains no dice of the selected
value, then the category score
would be zero.
The next three categories ore
"SHORT", "LONG'
are used to score patterns that
121 YC
A I M &
include a number of dice whose
spots ore in order. "SHORT' requires
or least 4 dice in order so any of 1 2
3 4, 2 34 5 and 3 45 6 will score
the 10 points available. "LONG'
requires at least 5 dice in order so 1
23 45 or 2 345  6 will score the
20 points available. A "FULL"
requires all six dice to be in order so
only 1 2 3 4 5 6 will score the 30
points here. (Note: The dice do nor
have to be displayed in the given
order, the points will be scored as
long as each of the dice needed is
somewhere in the ﬁnal pattern.)
The four categories from "SET 3"
to "SET 6" are used to score patterns
which hove a number of dice
showing the same spot pattern. "SET
3" requires at least three of the dice
to be the some, "SET 4" requires 4
dice the same and so on up to "SET
6", in which all six dice should be
the dome (which does not happen
very often!) The scores for these
categories are 20, 30, 40, and 50
points respectively.
The ﬁnal category is called
"CHANCE" because it is a chance to
score ANY pattern of dice, the score
is simply the sum of all the spots
shown on the six dice, so 2 4 1 2 6 2
would score 2+4+1+2+6+2=17
points, the minimum score is 6 and
the maximum 36 so don't waste it.
In addition to these scores two
BONUSES are awarded, the ﬁrst if
concerned with the number
categories "ONES" to "SIXES"; if the
sum of the points in these six
categories is greater than 69 a
bonus of 50 points will be added to
the player's score. The second bonus
is awarded at the end of each
game, for each player it starts or 25
points and is reduced by 5 points for
each category with a zero score, so
if a player has more than four zeros
on his card he will get no points
from this bonus.
Control of the game is achieved
using a joystick in port number 2.
A  Let's ﬁnd out what's on the tape with
Ca ndyt
The joystick will control a "cursor" on
the screen, use the joystick to point
the cursor at the required function
and press the button. There are
several selections to be mode at the
beginning of each game, such cis
number of players, but these ore self
explanatory. On the main screen of
the game are several options;
The numbers "1" to "6" ore used
to move dice into a "rack" which
then may be kept whilst other dice
are re-thrown. To score a given die
in the rack, simply select the number
that is shown below that die.
The remaining three options ore:-
"ROLL" which is used to re-throw any
dice that ore not scored in the rock,
"DICE" which is used to empty all
the dice Out of the rack - in case
you change your mind or ﬁnd a
better pattern to keep, and "STOP"
which will move all of the dice into
the rock and end that turn.
In a similar way, scoring is done
by pointing the cursor at the
selected category on the score-card
and pressing the button. Choose
carefully as mistakes cannot be
taken back!
The only section not controlled
by the joystick is the entering of
player's names. This is done directly
through the keyboard. Names may
be any alphanumeric sequence of
up to ten characters, the names are
not checked in any way as they are
purely for the beneﬁt
As explained in the program, to
make the computer ploy for a
particular player, simply press the
Return key without entering any
name for that player The computer
will give its ﬁrst player the name CPU

1, second CPU 2, and so on.
For anyone interested, the
strategy of the computer players is
based simply on probability and loss
minimisation - the computer will
attempt to make the pattern it
thinks has the greatest probability of
success and will score the results so
as to lose the minimum number of
points. As the game is largely
Microdot
It is said that back in the 20th
Century there used to be people
who repaired computers when they
broke down. They said that
computer repair would be a thing of
the past way back in the 21st
Century - little did they know!
Of course now that the
impossible has happened and a
military satellite has passed through
a freak radioactive storm,
malfunctioned, and is getting itself
ready to blast us all to Kingdom
Come, it's my job to sort it out.
They've given me the
'MICRODOT', a tiny remote
controlled craft capable of entering
the satellite and absorbing all of the
99 radioactive particles that the
storm left scattered around. And of
course it's my job to pilot it around.
avoid the hazards, collect the
particles and save mankind, again!
Obviously that's not all they
expect of me. Once I've collected
all of the particles I've got to re-
activate the circuits inside the
satellite and get the Microdot out -
all before mankind resembles a
greasy fried egg. Why me?
Play The Game
MICRODOT is controlled by a joystick
in port 2.
Left and right move you
horizontally.
Fire causes microdot to jump.
For extra height use the SPACE
BAR to activate the jumpdrive, ﬁre
and up on the joystick performs the
some function. Watch out you can
only use the jumpdrive ﬁve times
per game - unless you ﬁnd more.
Watch out for the following on
your travels:
BONUS TRIANGLES - One of six
rondom bonuses;

on the dice this strategy is sufﬁcient
and the computer will play a
reasonable game. In general scores
during games rend to be close until
the later rounds and it is very easy
for the situation to change suddenly
- particularly when any bonuses are
added.

For players with creative
tendencies MICRODOT comes
complete with its own construction
set. This allows you to create a
whole new set of levels. To enter the
editor press 'E' while on the opening
screen.
Editing the Layout
The landscape in MICRODOT is
made up of blocks of 3*3
score cards will be shown along with
the ﬁnishing positions of the players
involved. Pressing the Return key as
indicated will return to the title
screen and the start of the game.
At any time between the title
screen and the ﬁnal scores the
game may be aborted and re-
started by pressing the Control
(CTRL) key.
characters: including the reset
triangles, rubber mats, etc. Each
level is o 13 by 7 matrix of 91
blocks; the main labyrinth is a 12 by
12 matrix of 144 levels.
A joystick is used to move the
cursor through the levels. If you
move out of the matrix you will
move out of the editor and back
into the opening screens of the
game, the back arrow key (top left
of keyboard) has the same effect.
The ﬁre button on the joystick is used
to lay the character that you ore
currently moving around. Press any
letter to change the character that
you ore going to place. The INST-DEL
key will display all of the blocks
available. The function keys ore
used to select which of the four
different block styles is selected.
if you wont to delete, the @ key
will select a character that allows
you to rub-out your mistakes.
To set the start point press the
key.
Two blocks (F and X) consist of
3*3 blobs of electricity and appear
to be identical. Well, they're not.
Always use F, except when the
blocks form a pool embedded in
the ground.
Each room has separate colours
for the blobs of static electricity, the
rubber mats and the four different
brick types, these are normally
changed with keys 1-6. Since these
keys are also used when editing the
objects a letter at the bottom
signiﬁes which mode these number
keys are in When C is displayed the
number keys change the colours.
when S is displayed they change the
objects or Sprites. Use the RERAN
key to change mode.
With spark traps use the N key to
lay the beam between the pointers.
Positioning Objects
The moving blocks of electricity,
radioactive particles, bonus triangles
and the ﬁnal electricity switch are all
sprites or objects. A maximum
YC 1 3

number of seven sprites is allowed
in each room, each with its own
reference number, To create a new
sprite use the lowest unallocated
number, eg. if there are 5 sprites on
the screen press key number 6
a screen with no sprites etc. To
change an existing sprite simply
press its number.
Alter the position of a sprite by
moving the joystick, alter its colour
by pressing C. Press T to move
through the four sprite types. Sprites
can be wiped using W or ﬁxed by
pressing ﬁre.
Moving sprites travel for a speciﬁc
time and then return. This time is
measured by the RU value shown or
the base of the screen. This is
changed with the + and keys. D is
used to change the stafﬁng
direction, 5 changes the speed of
movement and A changes the
animation speed.
To see what your sprite looks like
hold down the left shift key_ NB
Sprites must NEVER overlap.
Save It All
Pressing the CURL key while in the
editor produces the Input/Output
menu. From here you will be able
to LOAD or SAVE your creations to or
from cassette or disk. Note, if using
disk you will only be able to save
one level on each side of your disk.

used for seeing into containers. eg,
LOOK INTO CHEST. It con also be
used to look at adjacent locations,
eg: LOOK EAST will tell you what
objects and creatures (except
hidden ones) ore there.
When g n g  an object to a
character, it must be done in the
form; GIVE (object) TO (character).
Eg: GIVE SACK TO ELVA_
Talking to other choracters
To talk to another character you
must mention the character and use
quotes, eg; SAY TO OGERON "GIVE
ME THE SWORD". Friendly characters
will usually cooperate if they can -
others not necessarily!
Sentences are nor limited to
VERB/NOUN, although this is
sufﬁcient in many cases, eg: GET

In many cases longer sentences
are necessary. eg: PUT SWORD INTO
CHEST or UNLOCK RED DOOR \MTH

Many objects are described by
both noun and adjective, eg; LARGE
KEY or NASTY KNIFE. If you want to
get the large key you could try GET

The ﬁrst two might be accepted,
unless there are any other large
objects of keys around • this would
cause confusion.
Abbreviations
Most words con be abbreviated to
two letters, and some to one, eg;
OPEN DOOR can be OP D.
Ambiguity can arise, though (for
example) LOOK IN CHEST QS LO CH

will be taken as LOCK CHEST - LOO
CH would work.
HINTS
Kentilla is a richly devious
adventure. Collecting objects is not
an end, just a means to it. You may
have to revisit some locations a
number of times in order to make
overall progress, and time may be
of the essence. Much is hidden, and
nor revealed at ﬁrst examination.
Apparently useless things might
have curious effects on those who
threaten you. The very title of the
game is of grew importance in its
playing.. but you will ﬁnd that out_

one sword against
the entire Red Army
may not sound like a fair
match but when that man
is the iron strong, titanium
blade wielding Strider it
will be the Russians that
think they are
outnumbered! Your
mission is to inﬁltrate the
Reds and send back
secrets that could save the
world. Beware, this is not
the Russia of glasnost and
peristroika, it is set in the
future where the KGB
guards wield laser riﬂes
and ore joined by deadly
robot gorillas.
Srrider is without doubt
the most athletic hero you
will ever control as he
jumps and somersaults his
way through the game's
scrolling screens. After all,
the world's been saved
before, although this time
you'll do it in style. So as he
leaps over the walls of
Moscow's Red Square or
over the frozen peaks of
Siberia even the smallest
jump is replaced by a
perfectly executed triple
ﬂip.
When in battle, Strider's
sword sweeps in an arc of
death and ﬂashes so
quickly that human eyes

can only detect a blur as
yet another enemy falls_
The game helps you
get started by giving
Strider a droid that circles
him and acts like a
protective shield But very
soon you're on your own
and you must battle
through the heat of
lowland jungles - guarded
by poison dart spitting
rockmen before a ﬁnal
battle with the Grand
Master of the KGB.
During this epic struggle
you will confront a host of
enemies, including laser
gun emplacements,
heavily armed KGB
agents, sabre toothed
tigers, rockmen androids
and giant end of level
creatures (such as the
massive metal monkey
that guards the entrance to
level two).
US Gold and Capcom
have done it again and
have converted a coin-op
machine that's every bit as
good as Forgotten Worlds_
It's also just as fast and
graphically impressive as
the earlier 16 bit versions.
So if you want the best in

action stick with your C64.

Title: Wicked
Supplier: Acthlision
Price: £9.99 Tope, £14.99 Disk
You need hands... V
5  hoot-em-ups come
and shoot-em-ups go,
and some may stick
around for more than ﬁve
minutes. Wicked is no ﬁve
minute wonder because it
will probably take you fat
longer than that to
understand what the heck
is going on.
You've been out on
the booze again with the
Gods of icm/ and order
and during some foolish
bet, which your memory
fails to explain, you've
been turned into a ring of
ﬁre. This is not as bad as
one might think at ﬁrst, I
mean it makes barbecues
a lot easier to hold. The
only prob is that you've
got to complete a task
before you can settle
down to a quiet life on
Patsy Kensit's gas stove.
It's the Beast see (he
must've heard the joke
that you told in the pub
about the Juniper bush, the
Devil himself, and a rather
peculiar shaped carrot)
he's taken over the entire
constellation, and you - QS
the hunkiest ring of ﬁre in
existence - must save all
by rescuing each of the
zodiacal signs.
Now comes the
confusing part. You start
the game by choosing
which sign you wish to
clear ﬁrst. They ore all in
levels of difﬁculty and you
can only choose the
easiest three at the
beginning. And then it
comes down to the game
itself.

As the ring of ﬁre, you
can move around the
playing screen at will,
although there are many
meanies around that will
sop some of your energy
on contact. The
constellations are plagued
with small lumps(?) of
viruses which you must
eliminate with your own
particular yellower than
yellow virus. You can plant
more seeds (or spores)
when they become
available, and when the
spore is set in a position it
will grow and multiply into
a large mass of yellow
blobs,
The 'dark forces ore
also multiplying and
growing, and once you
have wiped out all of the
dark spores it is Time to
move onto the next
screen, and therefore the
next bade. There are
three 'bafﬂes' to be won in
each of the twelve
constellations and they fair
from easy to bloody
impossible.
There ore also extra
abilities to be collected
from the middle of the
screen in the form of Tarot
cards that pop up every
now and again, some
have bad properties, some
good. And there you have
the gameplay, easy in
principle, confusing to
watch, and absolutely
great fun to play (very
addictive too).
I was none too
impressed when I ﬁrst sow
this on the Amiga, and
thought it was some
programmers attempt at
trying to do something
novel (and foiling
abysmally), but my mind
has been totally altered by
the 64 version. The
graphics ore very close to
their 16-bit counterpart,
and possibly look even
clearer on the screen. The
controls are so simple that
even a ten year old
artichoke could grasp
them. Even the sound is
souped up to a degree
that it resembles 'real'
music.
Bring me sunshine! A
Wicked is, how do I put
this without sounding too
cliched or pretentious,
wicked! It is a game that
has me squealing for
more. A game with more
to it than the average
shoot-em-up. A game that
will rake in unbelievable
amounts of dosh, if I have
anything to say about it.

and the books that he
wrote soon became

would be judged. They still
are, and any epic
fantasy adventure always
has a small comparison

A long rime ago,
Melbourne House - a hairy

released a cute little
adventure based on The
Hobbit. It rapidly found
immense fame and
fortune, and was
acclaimed by most to be
the best adventure of all
time The fact that it wasn't
was sadly overlooked.
It rook several years
before a sequel was to
appear, but appear it did.
And then a third one to
make up the trilogy of
Tolkien adventures. And it
is only now that they see a
rerelease in the form of a

None of them ore
excellent adventures, but

lives in a hole. Not a dark,
damp hole, but a well
furnished hole t he sort of
place you would expect a

The adventure follows
his frollicks with
Gandalf and Morin (a
grumpy, but handy, dwarf)
and his quest for fame and
riches. All this is done in the
revolutionary (well, it was
all them years ago) Inglish
parser, which now seems
dated, but mill perfectly
usable.
Lord of the Rings and
Shadows of Mordor also
use Inglish, but not quite to
the some effect.
Communication with other
characters is the best
advantage of Inglish, and
apart from that bonus it's
very similar to any other
early adventure parser
(you'll ﬁnd you will have to
think for hours about the
right word to use).

only problem here is that
they ore both unfeasibly
slow in updating text (and
there isn't as much use of
graphics QS in The Hobbit).
The plot moves on to
Bilbo's nephew, Frodo,
who, with the aid of his
Hobbit chums, has a for
more daunting task to
perform. Frodo now bears
his uncle's ring, a magic
ring of power, which is

you may switch characters

continues the epic where

basically a simple shoot
'em up, but being pocked
with detail, and of an
accessible yet still
challenging difﬁculty level,
it becomes a very
satisfying game.
The object is to clear
various space stations,
moonbases etc. of lots of
nasty green aliens, who
seem to have managed
to get everywhere. There's
six different types, all with
different methods of
attack, but most of them
are fairly easy to zap. The
exception is o nasty little
sod called a Testa which
stands in the shadows and
stares at you, eventually
culminating with your little
man getting horribly fried.
It's a one or two player
game, with a horizontally
split screen. In the one
player version this means
that there's a rather ugly
blank bottom half, but this
doesn't affect the play_
You get a choice of one of
nine different characters to
take into action, and these
vary from scientists to
psychopaths, although
whoever you are, you still
have to spend most of
your time blasting the
monsters.

don't hove any idea
about football, and this
game shows this up. Not
that it's a bad game, it's
actually rather fun, but
some really odd little
features make it
somewhat curious.
It's on arcade
conversion of a Japanese
original, and the idea is to
try and win the Olympic
Soccer championship. The
Olympics? Yep, not the
World Cup or anything
groovy like that - the
Olympics. I suppose
somebody's got to do it...
The setting of course
doesn't affect the game,
and the fact that one's ﬁrst
game (taking on the role
of Great Britain, the well
known non-existent team)
is against Japan doesn't
change anything either. It's
a bit clumsy, but hey, I
can live with it.
The idea is that this ﬁrst
game is the Final of the
qualifying tournament and
if you win this, which is
quite easy, you progress to
the tournament proper. a
four round knock out
tournament. There's
supposed to be a total of
eleven teams, although
you are always pitched
against the some teams at
24 4 YC

each stage. It's probably
best to ignore the ludicrous
scenario and just think of
the object as being to
beat the computer.
Down to basics. The
gameplay is great, but the
graphics are lousy. This is a
bit unfair I suppose, I know
you can't perform miracles
with a C64, and there are
some nice touches -
particularly the animation
when a player jumps to
head the boll - but the
choice of colours for both
pitches and players leaves
a lot to be desired. It can
sometimes get very
confusing, trying to
decipher which are your
players and which are the
opposition. The play
however, is great. Very
responsive control, nice
and easy to turn or shoot,
Tackling is easy, but it does
show up the game's title
as a misnomer, There's no
way you can foul, or duff
up the opposition if that's
the bag you're into. Each
game lasts just over two
minutes, and each time
you, or the opposition
score there's a little fanfare
and a message comes up
- 'Goal! Nice Shooff. The
kips can't spell either.
It's a reasonably quick
game, but there are a few
tricks which once sussed
makes it pretty easy to
win, especially at the lower
levels. There's a one player
against the computer
option, a two player game
and, best of all a two
players against the
computer option. This
means two of your team
are under joystick control,
and you can actually start
to build up moves, rather
than just rely on the
computer providing you
somebody to pass to.
So, overall quite a nice
little game, that's bound to
be popular despite being
rather shallow. It's almost
worth playing just to see
the amazing contorting
cheerleaders that display
themselves whenever you
win a game. Freaky.

be damn good. It has to
have many elements to
grab a budding sport
enthusiast's attention, as
well as satisfying the more
experienced of the genre.
There has been no such
true simulation of cricket,
until now!
Cricket Master is the
second game to come
from newly formed
company Challenge
Software (the ﬁrst being
the excellent Treble
Champions) and as such
will be seen as a milestone
with which to judge future
product. No cricket fan of
any intensity will be
disappointed with this
milestone.
You play the port of
the Captain of a one-day
international squad, and
must use your abilities to
win against another
nation. And unlike other
cricket orientated games, it
is solely your tactics and
strategy that will
determine the result, not
your arcade skills.
First off, upon loading,
you must select your skill
level (Out of 3 varying
difﬁculty), the opponents
you wish to play against
(stuff those Aussies Er,
sorry to all of our Australian
friends!), and the number
of overs to participate in
(40-60). Then iris team
selection time, where you
get to choose the players
that will win the game for
you (surely not that
accurate where the real
England is concerned!).
There are different
categories of player in
both the batting and
bowling classes. Batsmen
are any of - opener,
stroke, middle order, and
tail - all of which perform
the task of their namesake.
The bowlers are a little
more restricted to types
fast, medium, and spin. To
determine how good a
player is or his speciﬁc
function, he has a form

the players on the other

These depend on the
weather or the time (it can

and all sorts of other very

set the position for your

You must also determine

play the part of a dolphin

pumping toxic crop

can embark on the second
mission, but all sorts of
mutated plants and sea

prevent you from
completing this task.
Then comes the
'Dumping at Sea'
campaign. You must stop
the nasty blokes on the

doing their dastardly deed
by taking over their three
crones. This is not easy, and
will only be completed by
the hardiest of

up, and the title carries
probably the biggest

twelve different sporting
categories as your
specialist subject, and hove
the option to set any
length of rime limit for
answering.
The game consists of
seven different rounds and
these are basically the
same as in the original
show. The ﬁrst two rounds
are Standard Question
rounds, with each player
getting a single question in
any of the three players'
specialist subjects, or
general sporting
knowledge, There's two
points for the correct
answer, but it's one of
those games that ﬁrst prints
the answer, and then asks
you to enter whether you
were right or wrong_ It's
therefore very easy to
cheat, and win every rime!
(I wondered why you
were so good at it! - Rik)
The next round is 'Hit for
Six', where you get six
goes to guess the answer,
after being given clues of
increasing obviousness_ The
quidcer you get the answer
the more points you get.
Then there's more
Standard Question rounds,
followed by the 'Jigsaw
Picture' round. This is very
similar to the Hit for Six
section, except you get a
slowly revealed, and
virtually indecipherable,
picture to help you, rather
than a series of written
clues.
The last round is best,
being a buzzer round,
where the ﬁrst to hit their
button gets to answer a
general knowledge
question. Get it wrong and
you lose points. Obviously
the evental winner is the
player With the most points
at the end.
It's reasonably good
fun to play, but there's little
in the way of graphics and
sound to make the game
exciting, and if you're into
sports trivia, you could buy
a quiz book for a lot less
than this game.
This game is thoroughly
bland, the sort of game
with no real purpose, that
still makes for reasonably
enjoyable play. It's not
bad, it's just not worth the
money.

Title: Soldier Of Light
Supplier: Rod
Price: E2.99
5  oldier of Light is yet
another budget
rerelecise, this time
from newely formed Rod
(a dMsion of Softek/The
Edge). It faded into
obscurity last time around
but at rhe price of £2.99 it
should do fairly well.
It is based on the
successful Toito machine
(so successful nobody in
the ofﬁce has ever heard
of it) and seems to be
average shoot-em-up
material. You have to visit
a planet, wipe out its
inhabitants (using a variety
of weapons so me  of
which you'll ﬁnd along the
way) and return home in
time for scones and
medals.
Everything about the
game is overage, and I
suppose that's what makes
it o good budget game.

have released what could

Cosmic Pirate will be

the C64, is brilliant and
would more than hold its
own in the full-price
market.

was brilliant, this is a
steamy pile of pig
pool! I have to honestly
say, with my hand on my
nose, that this is the worst
budget game I've ever
hod the displeasure in
playing.
Admittedly, it is the ﬁrst
real game that has tried to
emulate the thrills and
spills of mountain bike
racing, but it is done so
badly that wiping the tape
clean is far too good for it.
I shall now attempt to
explain what the game is
about (whilst clenching my
brain the size of an
amoeba!

teeth). You are the proud
owner of a brand spanking
new mountain bike and
you must race another
owner over oil sorts of
terrain. This is done in
Kickstart style (ie, split
screen) but to compare it
with the Mastertronic
masterpiece would be a
gross misjustice.
The graphics are awful,
the gameploy is non-
existent. and the price is
E2.99 too much. Luckily I
hod a great escape when
it crashed after only the ﬁrst
playing...

Title: Stunt Car Racer
Supplier: MicroStyle
I
Formula One Grand
Prix Racing has been
banned for the past iwo
years ostensibly on the
grounds of safety, and now
44 4 VC
Price: 6.14.95 Disk
the World's top racing
drivers compete on the
spectacular and dangerous
Stunt Car circuits, At least
this is what it says in the
introducrin to this rather
splendid little driving
game from Micro Style.
There are eight
different circuits, ranging
from the reasonably
straightforward to the
downright hair raising. You
can practice on any of the
circuits but the real object is
to race against the
computer controlled
opponents and progress
through a leage structure.
There are four divisions
each based around just
two of the eight circuits,
and you hove to compete
against two other drivers
for a total of four races
each season. The driver
with the most points wins
promotion to the next
division, taking on more
difﬁcult circuits and more
competent opponents. If
you can manage to be
Division One Champion,
this means you can gain
access to the Super-
League. This works along
exactly the some lines as
the other league but you
get a faster car with better
accelleration and braking.
Just how much faster
the Super League cars are
I never even got close to
ﬁnding out, since as with so
many of these racing
games, it is practically
impossible to win even
one race. The opponent
always shoots off in front of
you and if you can even
keep him in view you're
doing well. One
particularly good aspect of
this game however is that,
at least on the easiest
circuits, it doesn't take a
lifetime to practice to be
able to complete the
course without crashing. It
might be really hard to
'Mn, but or least you can
actually ﬁnish the races.
The controls are very
nice. You don't have ro
keep the joystick pressed
forward all the time, since

1 6 4 4 . 1 4 1 1 1 1 . 4 4 , 1 . •
once you've reached full
speed you will
automatically stay there
unless you brake. This also
allows you to take
advantage of the auto
alignment feature, which
means that on straight
sections of the track you
will automatically keep on
line, only having to worry
about steering at corners.
If you do manage to
crash there can be some
quite spectacular ones
since most of the circuits
are elevated some way
off the ground and you
spin and ﬂy through the air
on your way to your
doom. Still, a crane will
undoubtedly winch you
bock up onto the circuit to
carry on your by now
pointless pursuit of the
opposition,
The graphics are really
very good with a nice 3D
effect and some quite
convincing looking corners
and things. The colours are
sensible, the sound is good
and overall it's a very
good, very complete
game. Terrifﬁc

I have recently read an article in the
trade magazine 'Computer Trade
Weekly that suggests that YC is to
change dramatically. I would just
like it to be known that I support you
in every way. The C64 games
market is one that has been very
well supported by magazines in the
past, but as we approach the
nineties, everybody seems to be
changing direction,
Zzap is becoming more Amiga
orientated (and aimed at an even
younger market than before!), CU is
moving away from the 8-bit
Commodore at a ferocious rate,
and CCI has never really catered for
the 64 gamer. Your Commodore,
on the other hand, has been
gradually realising that the mallet
out here is very strong, and will
continue to be so for quite some
time.
I also commend you on the
decision to put a cassette on your
cover with free games on it, no
longer will we hove ro contend with
snotty Speccy owners 'boasting'
about their retrospective 'rags'.

Having been a regular reader of YC
for a goodly number of years I note
with some interest the recent
changes to the mag. In the past, YC
had, after some time, got the
content of the mag just right, viz,
computing, hardware, tech tips,
education, etc., and lastly games/
reviews (being the lowest priority in
my estimation).
Not only has the ﬂat spine gone
(an ideal method for identifying
volumes), but also a change of
content, with the emphasis being on
reviews, games and features.
Also, why are you covering the
Amiga when ARGUS produces (?)
mog just for this machine. Please
remember that there are serious
users out here in consumer-land and
rectify some of these 'retrogressive

improvements'.

THE TIME: Sunday, 23rd

THE CREW: A lone

owwr!!!
11 hat's right, the London
Motor Show has been and gone
for yet another year, and yet
again the public turned out in
droves to ooh, ahh, and ogle at a
collection of (mostly) four-wheeled
tingles which the majority of them
couldn't possibly afford.
It was the British car industry
which captured all the headlines this
year through - with the Japanese
pre-occupied with their own show in
Tokyo, here was the ideal
opportunity for the union jack to
take the limelight and plant it ﬁrmly
on Europe,
And they did so with gusto: The
Lotus Elan, the Panther Solo, Rover's
new 200, Vauxhall had the Calibra
Lotus Carlton, and Cavalier 2000651,
Jaguar's XIR 4.0 and 6-litre Xl.5 V12
were in evidence, and even Ford
got in on the oct with the UK debut
of the Fiesta X1124 Land Rover too
hod the Discovery and Range Rover
Vogue ready for all to see. And the
foreigners response? A couple of
new Mercedes (including the sporty
5005L), Mazda's MX-5, Nissan's
11 A spanking Merc 500.

years now mode on impression on
on awful lot of people, and or
£20,000 it's almost affordable too.
Quite frankly, it left me cold maybe
if Lotus will let me hove a go... Truth
be told. with on Isuzu-designed
turbo engine, this mother puts out
165 vbh (very big horses, oko bhp)
with ease. The controversial aspect
of the thing is the front wheel drive,

of the performance 90% of the
time." I'm tempted to say why not
try it for yourself, but at twenty grand
you'll be forgiven for passing on
that...
Taking on the foreign supercar
monopoly is Panther's new Solo - for
40,000 so vs you too can drive what
is arguably one of the most
attractive vehicles on the road. the
Panther Solo combines impressive
power (204 bhp) with incredible
rood handling to devastating effect;
this car is beautiful from top to
bottom, inside and out, and if you
haven't guessed already, I want
one! That said, there's a healthy
waiting list for this one - Panther
took a wrong turn a few years back
when trying to run before they could
walk, and the result has probably
upset a few people: it'll be smiles
everywhere though when it's
parked outside the door.
With a (claimed) maximum
speed of 150+ mph and 0-18 in 5.6
secs, there are very few cars on the
road today that'll leave this little
baby at the lights. I was impressed,
very impressed, although the garish
pink affair at the show may have
put a few people off, painter's joke
or no painter's joke.
Still with those cries of "ooh",
"ohh", and "HOW mud!?". Ferrari's
latest, the 348th weighed in at a
mere L64500 with a body that
was very low and very side, the
348th has excellent pedigree, and
there's no reason why the offering
should be anything but up to the
mark. It was pretty to look at, if
somewhat on the aggressive side in
terms of styling.

Back to British now with the
Raiitorl: based on the Jaguar XJ-5,
this monster was the latest William
Town creation and one of my
personal faves to boot - more later
but don't hold your breath to get
hold of one, E88,790 at your local
NOW!
The other big money award
goes to that old faithful, Rolls
Royce.The newest designs will still
have you digging into your pockets
after the ﬁrst 6100,000 - a life of
luxury never came cheap for
anyone, did it?
The Germans mode their
presence felt, with the new
Mercedes 5005L, BMW had the Z1
roadster on their books too (though
the much vaunted 8501 was
conspicuous by its absence). Oh yeh,
Porsche sow ﬁt to show off their
wares, including the 944 Turbo and
911 Carrera 4 Cabriolet, the midas
touch hasn't left them yet. Also,
curiously, I think I sow one of them
two-wheeled things on the BMW
stand, shu rely shome mishtake...
• Returning to Earth once again,
away from all the glitz and
glamour, by far the most interesting
features of the show were those
stands choosing to peep into the
history books - in association with
the Sunday Express, the extra-special
1964 Show brought a smile to the
face of just about everyone who
could remember that far bock
there were lots of fans around 25
years ago. and being mod on cars is
a fad that's never gone out of
date...
Brooks is a name that many
people won't be familiar with, they
are a new company specialising in
the auction of collectors cars -
launched earlier this year, this is one
company that knows what it's all
about. Their massive stand called
no less than E
ﬁrst auction. This stand made the
show for me, and my companion
was at pains to drag me away from
this one, and I still made it back a
couple of times... For a few all-too-
quick hours I honestly thought
paradise had paid me an earty visit.
Gorgeous. Loved it!
For those unlucky few who
couldn't make it too the Motorfair,
there's always the Motor Show at the
NEC Birmingham next year, where
the likelihood of more surprises is
quite high. Make it a date!
BEST OF THE BUNCH: Panther Solo
and the Railton.
BEST STAND: Brooks of London.
BEST BIMBOS: Hyundai and

es folks, Ws Hackatack time
again. No game is too big for
the gamesmaster Kirk. This
month ﬁnd cheats, pokes and
guidence to help even the worst
games-player crock those
impossible games. Anyway, enough
of these frivolities and on with the
tips.
Having trouble with the new System
3 game, TUSKER? Leave your cares
behind as we go on a guided tour
through the ﬁrst level.
First, you will need to ﬁnd the
GUN, ACID BOTTLE, WATER BOTTLE,
AMMUNMON (this is found in the
LARGE BOX) and the KNIFE. all of
52 4 YC
C KAIAK
which can be found in the desert.
To ﬁll the water bottle make sure
you hove the knife and water bottle
showing in the object/weapons
display. Now ﬁnd a coctus, stand left
or right of the base and stab to reﬁll
your water supply.
Find the cave entrance and
enter it. Once inside the cave enter
the ﬁrst small cave entrance you
see. Inside should be a chest which
can only be opened by punching or
kicking it, inside the chest you will
ﬁnd a book which tells of the task
awaiting you_ Find the pool of
water, here you will see a crocodile,
kill it with your knife. Now enter the
end cave past the pool of water
and pick up the gold nuggets and
the mochete. If you use the book
whilst standing in front of the wall all
the screens in level one will be
shown.
Leave the cove section and use
the machete to chop down the
bushes. Keep walking right
(avoiding nasties), you'll now arrive
at the end of the level where you
will see a giant slug, chuck the acid
bottle onto the chains that hold the
slimy creature ond this will release
him. If you feel mean you can shoot
the slug and watch the effect it has,
but you cannot kill it, to ﬁnish level
one leave the screen by the top
right corner.
Perhaps someone could send in
the rest of the solution?

but all the better for you - as it is my
life's work to play every vids, pinball
and electronic entertainment in
existence in order to sort out the
wheat from the chaff and save you
a whole lot of heartache and lost
pennies - down here in the Neon
Zone.
With the 1990's looming before
us, arcades are getting more and
more fun than ever before -
NEON ZONE
compared to home computer
games. The reason for this is simple.
Once you've bought your own
home computer (and shelled out a
fair amount of money for it to boot)
you are stuck with it for a number of
years. And it's the same for the
hardware manufacturers. Once
they've gone to the effort to design,
manufacture and market a
machine, they aren't going to rush
55

our and replace it with another
super fabby machine the very next
year.
Arcade manufactures have no
such limitations. Every time a new
PCB game is designed, if they
desire, they can completely alter the
hardware conﬁguration of the
board, taking into account new
advances in chip technology straight
away. Hence a lot of the new
games - Hard Drivin' for instance, or
the superb Winning Run, have
loodsa memory, custom processors
and two 68000's (the central
processor in the Amiga) chugging
away to produce all those fob
effects.
The fact wos, in the beginning of
home computing and video games,
the hardware in the current home
computers was comparable to the
conﬁgurations of the latest coin-
operated games. Defender, that
Williams classic, ﬁtted into 32K and
had a 6809 chip controlling the
action. Now, however, the top-end
coin-ops are pulling away from the
top end of the home sector - fast!
STUN. Runner is a good
example of this extraordinary
computing power being used to
good effect - the latest from Atari
Games_ This is very much a follow up
to Hard Drivin', in that it uses ﬁlled
polygon techniques, like Realtime
Software's Carrier Command, but
boy does it go fast.
Originally invisaged as a direct
follow up to Rood Blasters, this has
you controlling a speeder along
different race tracks, up against a
strict time limit and opposition that
has an annoying tendency to get in
the way.
Controlled quite intuitively by a
'yoke' kind of joystick, it is an
exhilarating experience as you rush
56 4 VC
along open sections, then move
right up onto the sides on the runnel
sections, using the techniques that
speed sled drivers use for optimum
speed, taking the outside line on
corners (so you're almost
perpendiuclar to the surface of the
track) to gain momentum.
There's zapping involved as well,
of course, so as you seemingly fall
down the track, you can blow away
(and get points for) the slower
'blocker' vehides, although there
are indestructible black drones that
you have no olternative but to
avoid.
This sit-down unit (it's like being
(stride a motorbike) and the feel of
the game itself is very similar to one
of the ﬁrst - and arguably the best -
video disc games which was called
Star Rider. It's a tribute to the
programmers involved on the
STUN. Runner project that ﬁve or six
years on they've been able to
emulate that kind of exhilaration in
software. Highly recommended!
Next a cautionary tale, however,
that points to the fact that throwing
large amounts of technology at a
game doesn't always make it
good one. Now Capcom, about a
year or so ago, brought its new CPS
system onto the streets, with a game
called Forgotten Worlds. This CPS
system was a generic motherboard
that Capcom hod spent a whole lot
of time and money developing -
the heart of which is a couple of
custom chips that out perform just
about anything else on the marker,
Forgotten Worlds was a great
game and most of the games
released using that system since
then, Gauls n' Ghosts (the follow-up
to Ghosts n' Goblins), Willow,
Dynasty Wars and the most
successful Strider, hove all been
pretty good. Now we get the latest
of the lot, UN Squadron. And boy is it
bad.
Due to the power of the CPS
System, you have huge numbers of
very colourful, massive sprites,
rushing around or breackneck
speed. The thing is, it's a tedious
beyond words horizontal scroller that
is about as exciting as a ﬁve year
coma.
The plot, for what it's worth, has
you initially choosing a pilot/polane
combination, each with slightly
different ﬁrepower and handling
characteristics. The choice. A
Japanese ﬂying a Tiger Shark, a
Yank ﬂying a Tomcat, and a Dutch
ﬂying a Thunderbolt. Truly on
international selection; blaghl
International terrorists (armed to the
teeth too) are involved somewhere,
but even though it looks pretty, you
soon ﬁnd yourself dropping off as
you aimlessly blast away. Come on
Capcom! You have the technology
- now try and use a bit of
imagination!!!
Now here are some boys that
know how to put together a
horizontal scroller. I like Irem.
Standing for Innovations in
Recreational Electronic Media, this
company has been quietly getting
on with it for some time, producing
nice games like Dragon Breed. Their

newest, X-Multiply, does nothing
radically new, but the thing grips
you with its playability and intriguing
graphics.
One of the ﬁrst power-ups you
get gives you these tentacles that
move around in response to your
movements of the ship - and you
can ﬁre from then. The effect is
spooky! The game itself - horizontal
scrolling, collect power-ups and
massacre alines, based on a
scenario inside someone's body!
Why is it such fun when the
technically superior UN Squadron is
not? It must come down to
playability and play-testing. All you
can say is that one is a great blast,
while the other is a heap of doggy-
do. And who said there was no
mystery in the world of electronics?
Finally, to ﬁnish off this month's
offering, it looks like shooting games
are about to undergo another
revival - after a very short respite
during the summer of this year.
The phenomena that was
Operation Wolf from Taito was
followed up unsuccessfully by its two
player Operation Thunderbolt.
Meanwhile. SNK came up on the
inside with a very playable two
player shooty called Mechanised
Attack which was well received and
did very well for itself. Now SNK
have gone one better with Beast
Busters - a three player cross
between Mechanised Attack and
Splatterhouse. Splatterhouse? That's
a Namco game that has you taking
on the character of a maniac
wearing a hockey mask who, meat
clever in hand, takes on all sorts of
sicko noshes. Particularly surreal is the
scene that has you ﬁghting off a
roomful of pink, giant maggots. Kill
them all off and you see a corpse
hanging by its neck in the corner.
Odd. Then a last maggot bursts out
of its stomach and latches on to your
neck. Tasteful or what?
Beast Busters has you, (plus up to
two pals of course) blowing away
assorted gouts and unsavoury types
which dispel into piles of goo when
hit. Then you get the end of level
noshes, like a huge worm with razor
sharp teeth. Not a game to play
after a good lunch.
And now at last Sega has
entered into the shooting gallery
bloodbath with a two player game
called Line of Fire. Still at prototype
stage it features great graphics and
sound, as you'd expect from Sega,
with you supposedly progressing
around a ﬁxed track on the back of
a jeep, blasting at anything that
moves. I must admit, I don't like
these sort of games - bur for those
of you that fancy joining the gun
club, this one is going to make you
very happy indeed.
That's it for now - next month
detail of the long awaited follow-up
to Chase HQ, Special Criminal
Investigations. still then, give the
aliens hell - and if you're playing
pinball, don't press both ﬂippers at
once, will you?

Dear YE,
I hove recently purchased a
second hand Commodore 64
computer and am very happy with
it. However.. I do have one problem
- loading games.
I hove purchased a number of
games from my local computer
shop but have been unable to get
any of them into my computer_ I
follow the instructions on the cassette
inlays for loading on a Commodore
64 but it never seems to work.
Everytime I try to load a program I
get ﬂashing lines on the screen and
sometimes get a loading screen.
Sometimes my computer suddenly
restarts as though I had just turned it
on, others the tape reaches the end
but my computer just sits there and
looks at me.
Con you please tell me what I
am doing wrong. I know there is
nothing wrong with my cassette
recorder as I have iyped in a
program from the instruction
manual, saved it onto my own tape
and then loaded it without any
problems:
James Sutton Birmingham
Dear James,
It sounds to me as if it is your
cassette recorder that's up to the
creak even though you seem to
think that it's OAK!
You no doubt already know that
a cassette recorder uses a small
head to read and write information
on your cassette tape, exactly the
same as your personal stereo or Hi-
R. This head should be at a right-
angle to the tape that is passing in
front of it in order to read the
information stored. It is possible for
this head to move away from its
right-angle position, when this
happens information passing in front
of the head may not be read
correctly. Information that you save
to the tape while the head is out of
its correct alignment will be read
back in without any problems since
the information will be saved to the
tape at the same angle as the
head.
Since commercial tapes are
produced to a very high standard
on equipment that is checked
regularly the information on your
bought cassettes cannot be read by
your misaligned head while
information that you save can.
So what should you do about It?
What you need to do is get the
head of your cassette recorder back
-
to its correct position. You can do
.16

this yourself using a small jewellers
screwdriver and a bit of patience.
If you take a look at your
cossette recorder you should ﬁnd a
small whole in the front panel. If
you put a cassette into your recorder
and press play, you will be able to
adjust the head by turning the small
screw visible through the hole
mentioned. DO NOT turn this screw
unless you ore sure you know what
you ore doing. I suggest that you
make a small pointer and stick it
onto your screwdriver so that you
con return the screw to its correct
position if you can't improve the
loading.
A number of commercial
products are available that will help
you re-align the head on your
cassette recorder with ease. I have
used the Dotossette Doctor program
from Trilogic with considerable
success.
Dear YC,
I just love playing computer
games, but, and ifs a BIG but, I'm
totally useless at them. A number of
magazines, and I believe that you
are about to start, print cheats for
games so that you can get extra
lives, more ﬁre power, etc. Many of
these cheats require that you POKE
certain numbers into the computer
so that the cheats start to work
Unfortunately I hove never been
able to get any cheats to work as I
am not clear how to go about it. I
hove tried entering these pokes
before I load the game but they
never seem to work,
What am I doing wrong?
Paul Simminds, Bridlington
Dear Paul,
In order to enter any POKEs into
a game you must have some sort of
reset switch attached to your C64 so
that you can break into them AFTER
the game has loaded, not before as
you have tried.
The simplest reset switch, and
one well worth having, is attached
to the RESET line (pin) and GROUND
(pin) on the user port of your C64.
All you need is a simple push to
make switch attach to the pins
mentioned and hey-presto your
very own reset switch. If you don't
feel up to a bit of home electronics
then try and ﬁnd someone who is.
Should you ever enter the mystical
world of machine code
programming then you'll ﬁnd a reset
switch invaluable.
Unfortunately because of piracy
most computer games are
protected against a reset switch.
However, there are a number of
commercial cartridges that will
allow you to reset just about any
game. My personal preferences ore
the Expert Cartridge and the Action
Replay cartridge, although the
Power cartridge offers a reset facility
and a host of other features at a
much lower price.
Once you've reset your game
you should be able to enter your
POKEs with ease. Some cartridges
even have built in monitors that
allow you to enter your cheats
without having to return to BASIC.
Dear YC,
I have been typing in a rather
long program from one of your
earlier magazines (Lady Bug June
1985) and every time I try to run it I
get on error message appear. The
message says 'Syntax error in line
1000'. I hove checked this line over
hundreds of times and I can swear
to you that there is no error. Please
tell me where I am going wrong
before I go completely mad.
F. Carter, Biggleswade Hens
Dear Mr. Cotter,
This problem is as old as time
itself. What you must understand is
that when an error message
appears, it does not necessarily
mean that the error is actually in the
line mentioned. Having checked on
the program in question, it is quite
obvious that you hove an error
somewhere amidst all your data
statements. The error message
points to line 1000 because that is
the line that is POKEing the data
into memory, and it is trying to poke
on illegal value. Check your data
statements.
Dear YC,
I am fairly new to computing,
having taken it up as a hobby after
retiring from work in August of this
year. Although I am still fairly active,
my powers of learning hove
obviously gone. The main problem I
have is this. If I want to make a loop
within a program, for example FOR
A=1T020:PRINT "HELLO TIM"
according to the manual I should
follow this with NEXT A. Sc why do I
often see in listings the following
FOR A=lto20:PRINT -
TIM":NEXT (with no 'A')?
T. Canoe*, Winchester, Hants
Dear Mr Connely,
This is one of those problems
that isn't really a problem. In effect
both of the above statements are
right. However, some would soy
that you should put a variable after
the NEXT statement. By doing so you
make your program more readable,
especially if you have a lot of
nested loops. The drawback of
course is speed. If you leave the
variable Out after the N u t  the
computer assumes that it is still in
the some loop, therefore it saves
time. Basically it is a matter of
personal choice. (I always leave the
variable off!)
Dear YC,
Quite often I type in programs
from books and magazines that
contain masses of data statements.
Sometimes the data statements are
at the front of the program.
Sometimes they are after oll the
other instructions. Quite a lot of time
there are a lot of within the data
line. A friend said that by putting the
data statements or the front you can
have time. Why is this? Also, what do
the comma's stand for?
G. Holiday, Bedford, Beds
Dear Mr Holiday,
Your friend is right. If you have
lots of data statements it is usually
best to put them at the front of your
program. The reason for this is quite
simple. As you know, because Basic
is an interpreted language, after
each instruction it has to go back to
the start of a program and virtually
read everything back until it comes
to it's place again. By putting the
data statements at the front of the
program it means it does not have
to travel too far before reaching
where it left off. (I hope this is clear
enough for you to understand).
As for the commas in the data
lines. This is a memory saving trick.
When Basic is READing data and it
comes ocross a ',' the READ
statement assumes a zero, or null
for strings. Therefore the statement:
10 FOR )s,lto10
20 READ X
30 PRINT k:NEXT
40 DATA 2,4_5,7 3,4,1
would produce 2 4 0 5 7 0 0 3 4 1.

FORWARD
MARCH
ob Malin, the man at US Gold
responsible for pushing
strategy product, once said.
"The strategy games market
never been so buoyant," and
he ought to know. Hence, in this
column I will attempt to keep you
up to date with what is happening
in the strategy and simulation
markets.
Strategy is a genre whose borders
are becoming more and more
blurred. Whilst we ore all happy
enough with traditional war games,
many arcade games are getting a
healthy dollop of strategy to enliven
things.
One thing you notice about the
strategy specialists is that all the
company titles have three initials.
We have SSI, SSG, CCS and PSS. SSI
has been releasing wargames ﬁrmly
based on the board wargame
tradition for many years. It is by far
and away the most successful
company in the market and has
several products which are due for
release in the near future. "Storm
Across Europe' is a grand strategic
level recreation of WWII with
quarterly turns. This appears to
borrow several ideas from one of
my favourite board games "Hitters
War", one of those near perfect
designs which, whilst not achieving
the epic realism of such games as
"Third Reich" and ''Drang Nach
Osten", managed to transmit a
wonderful sense of atmosphere,
and you could get through the
game in an evening.
SSI's "Overrun" promises to bring
the highly detailed and very
popular "Panzer Strike" tactical
system right up to date. Battalion
level forces ore commanded in
Europe and the Middle East in "near
future" conﬂicts (let's hope not the
very near future). The "Panzer Strike"
is one of the best tactical systems
around going down to the level of
indMdual vehicles and squads. It
owes a lot to the best table top
wargame systems and uses the
computer to take the hard work out
of calculating the effects of such
diverse factors as morale, command
control, silhouette and target facing.
The computer also comes into its
own when restricting the "eyeballs in
the sky" syndrome where the table
top general con survey the whole
board. In this system, the computer
handles all the hidden movement
and visibility calculations, so that only
units you could really "see" appear

on the screen.
SSI also has another board
gaming mainstay up its sleeve, a
Napoleonic battles system. "Battles
of Napoleon" gives you a whole
bunch of famous bafﬂes to reﬁght.
or you can design your own_ The
company also has something called
'Demon's Winter" under
development which seems to
involve a lot of barbarians, thieves
and wizards, so I don't suppose
you'll want me to go into all that. SSI
is also continuing to release
Advanced Dungeons and Dragons
products. I know this game system
has a great many fanatical followers
but I'm not one of them.
SSG are the pretenders to the
strategy crown. Roger Keating and
Ion Trout started this company out of
a passionate interest in wargames
and simply thought they could do
better than 551 - all from the unlikely
setting of Australia. In my opinion
they have succeeded. My personal
favourite is "Reach for the Stars"
one of the few games in my
collection that I will play again and
again. It is based on the board
game "Stellar Conquest" from GDW
(more initials). Four players (human
or computer) contest a stellar duster
in a game of strategy, subtiety and
ruthlessness. Players start colonies,
produce ships, planetary defences
and invasion forces. They are
constantly faced with make or break
decisions about investment,
construction ond tactics.
SSG prides itself in producing
tough computer opponents with its
innovative artiﬁcial intelligence
system. The company also likes to
emphasise the important of chain of
command in all its games. It dislikes
Generals twenty miles away
positioning the battalions.
SSG products are available
through Electronic Arts in the UK. It
supports its games with a regular
magazine called "Run 5" which
often contains extra scenarios to
support the ''Worpaint" scenario
design system, which most SSG
games contain. Speaking of EA,
although not big players in the
strategy ﬁeld any more, they did
produce two of my favourite
strategy games: "Mule" and
"Archon". These are both abstract
strategy gems from years ago. Try
asking very nicely and I'm sure the
company will ﬂog you a copy from
their back catalogue_
Finally, MicroProse has dabbled
in the strategy market from time to
time although its mainstay remains
the simulation ﬁeld With the
purchase of Telecomsoft, it acquired
Rainbird which was building a
reputation for producing arcade/
strategy games such as "Tracker' r it
will be releasing two such games
under the Rainbird label. "Epoch" is
an intriguing title which involves
Machiavellian goings on in a
medioevol court. All the kingly arts
of economics, conquest and
diplomacy are included with a spot
of Errol Flynn stuff thrown in for good
measure.
Carrier Command is still "coming
soon", The game is substantially
different to cater for the machine's
well known dislike for handling

vector graphics and 3D ﬁlled
polygons. Lets hope some of the
strategy bugs present in the other
versions have been ironed out this
time.
Mike Singleton is a name which
needs no introduction for strategy
fans. Although the ﬁnal part of the
"Lords of Midnight" "trilogy" never
turned up, his next release should
make up for it. "Starlord" is the long
awaited home computer version of
the very popular play by mail game
(which was o r  perhaps still is -
available on Micronet). The number
of players has had to be cut down a
bit to a mere ten rather than the
dozens involved in a PBM game.
These can be human or computer
opponents.
The idea is to conquer planets,
build up forces and eventually take
on the Imperial Forces at the
galaxy's centre. Once there, it is a
simple matter of stopping oil the
other players who ore trying to do
exactly the same to you. Diplomacy,
alliances and double dealing ore
the big things about "Starlord"_ I
suspect that people will get the
hang of the game mechanics
playing the computer and the Royal
Mail will then make a small fortune
with data disks whizzing around the
country as people ploy by mail on
the cheap (compared to shelling
out 61.50 a turn as it used to cost on
a mainframe). MicroProse ore
promising on arcade shoot em up
element, but I do hope this can be
disabled or it might prevent it being
played by mail.

11 irstly, I must apologise
for the non-appearance
of Milligan/McCorthy's 'Skin'
in Crisis. After all, how was I to
know that some beer swilling Sun
reading printer was going to declare
it obscene? And that, after I had
declared it a highlight of last year in
my ﬁrst column, Aaah, the perils of a
three month deadline and sneak
previews._
You can imagine the scene(s)
that led to 'Skin's' non-appearance:
''ere guy. 'ave you seen this rabbish
ere", says our Tetley drinking
protector of the Public Good.
Enter stage left, The Manager:
"Yes George, you're right. It simply
isn't the kind of thing we should be
putting our name to".
One can only regret that the
management at Fleetway,
publishers of 'Britain's most radical
mainstream cornier,, felt compelled
to take the legal advice that said
there was a possibility that Skin may
have been found obscene in a
court, and decide to follow their
printers example. McCarthy were
courted by every trendy mag in
London in need of a correcting dose
of radical comix.
Now, if up-to-the-minute reviews
ore out what must one do? Maybe
now that I am a paid journalist those
generous people at Titan Books
would send me on a round-the-set
voyage into the world of French
comic artist Moebius?
A European Excursion
Moebius is to comics what your
grandparents Led Zeppelin records
ore to the history of Rock: ie.
absolutely fundamental to an
understanding of the medium.
Moebius started big, as artist on THE
Western snip. With Blueberry he has
managed to hold the proud nation
of France to ransom for twenty-ﬁve
years. Starred in 1963. Blueberry
was only ﬁnally completed in 1988
at a cost to the French of millions of
6 6 1 C
ON
of Appel-Guery, and
metamorphosised into one of the
great architects of modern sci-ﬁ.
Sometimes, his pages soar, the alien
concepts transcending the limits of
pen and paper as they tell their
universe spanning epics.
They are populated by other-
world characters that seem to be
made up from every race, real and
ﬁcricious, that have ever inhabited
our culture. It's a utopian vision for
sure, but like Star Wars, or the great
super-hero myths, you'll believe a
man can ﬂy. The Inca!, serialised in
three parts over here, tells the story
of Everybum John Difool as he is led
on a galaxy spanning rites of
passage guest to the center of
'everything'. The dramatic cuts from
planet to planet, ship to surface, as
the protagonism ore led onto their
ﬁnal confrontation with the
ultiamate evil, ore achieved with a
skill that maintains belief and awe in
equal measure.
In Upon A Star, Stel and Aran are
forced to land on a ﬂat, featuriess
planet with only Tel's museum of the
universe's transport between them
and certain death. The only old
'jalopy' that works is a 'Traction'
Citroen doting from circa 1936. It is
wheeled out from the spaceship's
hold over iwo panels to glide
smoothly to a halt on the desert
surface of the unnamed planer. It's a
brilliant juxtaposition, the old car
ond that alien desert environment,
that somehow makes you want to
laugh and sigh at the some rime.
Life, is made of such moments.
If you hurry you may just be in
time to catch an exhibition of
Moebius originals at, of all ploces.
The Natural History Museum, where
his work is displayed alongside
some examples of natural crystal. Or
maybe you Terminal Kids could
borrow a copy of your brother's
Winter Heavy Metal to have a look
at the Moebius computer game.
Thanks to Liz Gay.

In the ever present search
for the ultimate plug-in aid
we put the power cartridge
under the magnifying glass
By S. Wickham
5  ince the days of caves and
ﬂint axes, man has
struggled to make life that
much easier for himself. He
invented ﬁre so that he could cook
food making it easier to eat. Later
he invented the wheel so that
getting around was much better.
Eventually he mode himself a
computer thot would take care of a
thousand tasks, thus leaving him
with plenty of free time to pursue
more pleasureable activities.
Not content with having this
wonderful grey box sot on his desk,
bed, lap or wherever he might have
it, he decides that he needs
something to make using the box
easier. Hence the dawning of a new
age. The name of this new era...
Cartridge Age.
Over the lost 4 years or so we
have seen many different kinds of
these 'Toolkit aids appear. Some
hove come and gone overnight.
Some have been with us for some
time.
I personally am a great believer
in these little pieces of
programming wizardry. Though I
must confess, it was some time
before I actually got round to using
them. Once the step was made, I
wondered how I ever managed
without them.
The latest to come out of the
'Cartridge factory' is POWER
CARTRIDGE from KG, distributed in
the UK by BITCON DEVICES LTD. In
case you ore wondering who or
what KG stands for, it is KOUT
COMPUTER SUPPLIES BY. Of
Dordrecht, The Netherlands. The
mere fact that they ore a Dutch
based company should inspire
conﬁdence. As most of us already
know, our European friends rend to
be that much better in producing
quality utility software, just like they
produce better sportsmen and
women. So what has this latest
cartridge got to offer?
Mere ore 5 main areas of
programming catered for. First and
foremost there is the POWER
TOOLKIT. This is a powerful Basic-
Toolkit that greatly simpliﬁes
programming and debugging, DISK
TOOL and TAPE TOOL are two
modules that speed up the loading
and saving of programs. The
commands that are available with
these two modules can be
incorporated in your own programs.
POWERMON is on extensive
machine code monitor with around
20 commands at your ﬁngertips. It
also works in Basic-ROM, Kemal and
I/O areas, as well as leaving ALL of
the computers memory available to
you. Finally there is PRINTERTOOL. A
very good printer-interface. There
are many printers catered for and
this makes conversing with different
printers a pleasure instead of the
usual chore.
The cartridge has one other
function, which I do nor see as a
toolkit function, the POWER RESET.
This function will be explained in
more detail later.
Power Toolkit
The toolkit has the usual batch of
extra commands you would expect,
such as AUTO, DEEK, DOKE, DUMP,
FIND and RENUMBER. There are two
in particular that I found very useful.
The ﬁrst being PAUSE. Delays in a
program do not now need to be
cumbersome to program. You
simply state PAUSE x (Where 'x'
equals the number of seconds you
want to pause for). The second
being SAFE. By using this statement
you can disable or enable the RUN/
STOP and RESTORE keys. There are
27 toolkir commands providing a
fairly comprehensive aid in the
development of your programs.
Disk/Tope Tool
The disk and tape tool commands
are fairly standard. Nothing really
unusual or outstanding. You can
load programs, up ro 6 times

quicker USin() the DLOAD command
or the normal LOAD. One little extra
feature is that non-commodore
compatible disk drives are catered
for by two new drive numbers. They
are 48 for device 8 and 49 for
device number 9. The rape
operations are similar but with the
addition of being able to SAVE up to
10 times quicker than normal.
Powermon
The powermonitor is once again
very useful, but fairly standard by
comparison to other Cartridges/
Monitors. There are 17 functions in
all ranging from Assemble,
Disassemble and Compare through
to Register display and Walk. (It's
always struck me as odd that my
Dolphin DOS monitor does not have
a Disassemble command!).
Printertool
This is perhaps one of the more
outstanding attributes that this
cartridge has. It detects whether you
have a printer connected to the
serial bus or the user port. All
Commodore characters can be
printed on Epson and compatible
printers and the interface allows for
many set-up possibilities. You can
produce hardcopies of HIRES and
LOU') screens, not only on the usual
serial printers but also centtonics like
EPSON, STAR, PANA5ONICetc. The
HARDCOPY command detects
whether it is a HIRES or LORE screen
that you want to print. A number of
sub-functions of the PSET command
which allow a number of different
effects to be set up.
Power Reset
Now we come to the Power Reset.
As stated earlier, I do not consider
this as a roolkit function or
programming aid. In my own
opinion this is really a 'hackers tool.
The primary function of the RESET is
ro freeze a program and then save
out the whole of memory. You may
then select CONTINUE from the
menu and the program will carry on
as if nothing hod happened.
When you initially press the RESET
button a sub-menu appears giving
you the option to select from:
CONTINUE - allows you to return to
your program
BASIC - Return to Basic
RESET - Normal reset
TOTAL BACKUP DISK - Save the
whole of memory onto disk_ The
program may be reloaded later
with ROAD followed by CONTINUE
TOTAL BACKUP TAPE - As for the
above but to tape
RESET ALL - RESET of any program
HARDCOPY - Prints our a copy of the
screen. You can return to the
program by use of CONTINUE
MONITOR - Takes you into the
POWER MONITOR
Final Analysis
Compared to some of the cartridges
on the market, this may at ﬁrst
glance appear to be somewhat
primitive. Unlike some of the
products around you cannot Disable
Sprites, Pinch character sets,
Compress programs, Make coffee
and knit a jumper. However, what it
does do is make the life of the
serious programmer, notice I said
programmer and nor hacker,
somewhat easier. For it's price I
would have to say that the Power
Cartridge is money well spent.

He is quick to indicate that the
duet of computer and photograph
can be problematic. The rhetoric of
that combination is frequently
hazardous, the outcome is
potentially open to abuse. Ifs
signiﬁcant that some of the stranger
photographic transformations shown
in the gallery are by advertising
photographers. Duplicity, the 'angle'
selling charm by profession their
forte, port of their reportare. The
accent is on charge, it is on making
something ﬁt: -
for you because._."
Naturally enough corporate
handiwork is liable to use anything
that lets it achieve its singular
promotional ends. It's this that
makes the joining an artistically and
corporately sensitive area.
Photography has never been
perfect. Since its ﬁrst exposures it has
been manipulated to ﬁt the desires
of each photographer for colouring
in, shading and burning in, replacing
skyline, removing subjects. It's been
a relatively easy media to alter,
abuse, manipulate, exploit,
encourage - whatever you want.
Cut and poste, isolate, extract. add.
Ghost and fairy photo sogos are
popular mystical adumbrations of
the duplicity of photography. The
equipment mode available to the
photographers at crosﬁeld has
complemented it with (access to

greater ﬁnesse.
Representation has never been
exact - see the Vogue model, walk
by her in the street, then see the
pimpled, photo protected wo(mon)
is hardly the same as the temple of
perfectness wearing...
The computer grabbing,
colouring re-shaping and ultimately
reforming practices are another
weight and opportunity (it depends
how you view it or intend it) on the
susceptibility of photography to
abuse.

Bur this talk is too gloomy.
Machine Dreams has the future of
photography in mind, presumably
this means a positive genuine one.
Talking to Nick Hallom, the gallery's
press ofﬁcer, this would seem to be
so.
This exhibition is seminal, its
intention prophetic presenting the
link with computers as one avenue
which photographers will in the
future be free to take. The cost of
equipment and "valuable"
machine-time, as David thandier
A Colum Colvin
points our, is inhibiting to all but a
few of the most prominont
commerdal photographers.
The Amiga presents, at the low
end of this market, a more
instantaneous accessing point for
ortists, photographers and designers.
Its increasingly sophisticated
digitizing interaction has placed it
ﬁrmly within their reach. Compared

the equipment at Crosﬁelds,
The Amiga was lent to the
gallery as a hands on demonstration
tool close to the advertising section
of the exhibition. Visitors to the
gallery were able to use its paint
packages as a practical element to
the exhibition.
For the gallery visitors this was a
basic starting point. Most point
package owners will be familiar to
a degree with a ﬁrst try outcome.
Some of the photographers felt this
themselves trying out their
equipment for the ﬁrst time. Techno
phobia was quite apparant
ironically for someone who has to
know the difference between 100
ASA taken on a 120, using a
Hasselblad, from a polaroid on a 5
x 4. Visually they knew the effect
they wanted.
But or times most of the work is
of synthesis where the splicing and
grabbing and superimposition was a
natural step. The systems were
adaptable to a normal photo
methodology of adding, covering
multiplying - Viz-a-Viz the 'photo'
pluralality of D. Hockney,
With the row materials in place
the combination was rapid if not
that unconventional. Arguments
were put forward suggesting what
they were doing could be done
anyway. It was quicker (cleaner and
alterable) than their usual, but not
different.
Opinions were varied on the
compatibility of the two mediums,
both practically and artistically. One
of the initial barriers to be overcome
is an artistic one. Media status has
always been an occlusion to new
ideas. High end computer graphic
capabilities hove only been around
for a few years so the tension of
acceptance has not been active for
long. Once the tension is increased
there'll hove developed a situation
of greater cOnITOSt between colour
photography, black and white,
watercolours, oils, etc. Mists and
photographers will have the
opportunity to practice and
familiarise with this new media.

Co"
elcome to a new column
in YC, one dealing exclusively
with adventure and role
playing games, together with
the occasional outpouring from the
warped and deranged mind of the
author a  ITO insporting Barbarian
called Cedric Bottomthwaite. There
Cedric the
troinspotting
barbarian
introduces you to a
column even more
interesting than the
Orient Express'
timetable.
is only one way to halt these
random jottings and that is for you
to write in.
I will be pleased to accept
letters, comments, hints, maps and
ten pound notes or anything else
resembling a bribe. In return, you
get the chance to see your name in
print, probably spelt incorrectly and
almost certainly with a great deal of

abuse heaped at you if you fail to
include at least a ﬁver. As an
incentive, because bribery works
both ways. I shall threaten to sit on
the editor (a fate worse than death)
until he opens his treasure chest and
coughs up some sort of prize for the
best epistile received each month.
Such is the way of the world,
there is nothing whatsoever to
review this month so you will hove
to put up with a load of gibberish
anyway. However, because this is
the ﬁrst edition of the column and it
is traditional to have some sort of
opening offer, I thought that we
could start with a readers poll.
Now I know what games I like,
but what about you? What I wont
you to do is complete the coupon
below, giving details of your top ﬁve
adventurers of all time and your top
ﬁve role playing games. I will tot up
both the votes and work out a YC
Readers' popularity chart. The
person whose list most closely
resembles the completed chart will
receive a STUNNING PRIZE! This will
be an original illustration of yours
truly as seen through the eyes of
one of our resident artsists. The
picture will be suitably framed and
sent to the winner so that he or she
can throw spears at it as they see ﬁt.
You can vote for any game you
want as long as it has appeared on
the C64. Just to jog your memory,
here are some of the games that
you might like to consider although I
must stress that the list that follows is
by no means exhaustive and
anyone sending in an entry
consisting solely of my suggestions
will be immediately disqualiﬁed for
crawling.
On the adventure front the ﬁrst
game that I, and I suspect many of
you, played was THE HOBBIT. Then,
there has been a whole host of
games from Level 9 starting with
such early classics as DUNGEON
ADVENTURE and SNOWBALL. all the
way through to recent titles such as
GNOME RANGER and SCAPEGHOST.
Mother British company with a
reputation for producing excellent
games is Magnetic Scrolls whose
titles include THE PAWN and GUILD
OF THIEVES. From the other side of
the Atlantic came some of the most
highly rated games ever released
namely those from Infocom. Titles
such as the ZORK trilogy,
SUSPENDED, HITCH-HIKERS GUIDE TO
THE GALAXY and LEATHER
GODDESSES OF PHOBOS have all
attained cult status but there are
E
many other games in their
catalogue to choose from.
Role playing games hove been
around for nowhere near as long as
adventures so the list is considerably
smaller and, at the the moment,
almost exclusively American.
Possible contenders here include
PHANTASIE I-Ill, BARD'S TALE I-III,
ULTIMA I-V, OUESTRON I-II, POOL OF
RADIANCE and CURSE OF THE AZURE
BONDS.
Please complete the coupon
below and send it in as soon as
possible. With o bit of luck and the
absence of any invasions by
warmongering goblin tribes, the
results should be ready in two
months time.
Now, brilliant and omniscient though
I am (and so big headed thot you
have to walk down dungeon
corridors sideways - Ed), I do not
always have the time to ﬁnish every
game that I review. (Noises of -
shouts of "cheat", "fraud",
"charlatan", "I wont my money

back'', etc.) This is purely due to the
pressure of work and not, I hasten to
odd, due to any great
incompetence on my parr (chorus of
we don't believe you")
If then you happen to get
terminally stuck in the middle of a
game, there is a reasonable chance
that you will get less than complete
satisfaction if you write to me for an
answer. There are however two
possible solutions.
H you have completed a game
(or indeed, more than one game
smart a*te b u t  your're not
allowed to soy arse! Ed) and are
willing to help a few plebs who are
obviously nowhere near as
intelligent as you are, then let me
hove your name and address,
phone number and times when you
can be contacted, together with
details of the games that you can
help with and I will print the
appropriate details.
Secondly, if you prefer the more
professional approach, then you
might like to consider joining the
Ofﬁcial Secrets club. For a fee of £22
per annum you get the following
goodies. A free copy of the game
Myth, a light hearted romp round
classical Greece written by those
wonderful people at Magnetic
Scrolls. (Note: we have been asked
to point out that Myth has nothing
whatsoever to do with Myth - History
in the Making by System 3),
In addition, you also get a free
copy of Gnome Ranger from Level
9 (Or a surprise alternative if you
already possess a copy). Plus six
issues of the magazine Conﬁdential,
32 A4 pages packed with
adventure news. Plus access to a
huge helpline where you con
phone in with your problems and
have them solved there and then
for you. Plus membership of Special
Reserve, a discount software dub
that allows you to purchase most of
the latest releases at 65% R.R.P. plus
P&P (games available on disk only).
If you are interested in joining
Ofﬁcial Secrets, then please get in
touch with John Trevillan, Inter-
Mediates Ltd., 2 South Block, The
Maltings, Riverside Way,
Sawbridgeworth, Hens CM21 9PG or
'phone him on 0279 726585.
That's all for this month. Next
month, how to make a doorstop out
of on orc's head. Please send those
coupons in and start writing letters -
even abusive ones. May your battle
axe always have blood dripping
from it.

Leisure Suit Larry 4
Larry Sparks has recently confessed
to being a 'closet funky hipster'. This
has shocked many staff members of
Activision UK, who previously
thought that he was in fact the
reincarnation of a dormant sloth. His
pastimes, it has been revealed, are
'scratching', drinking lager shandies,
and listening to the Reynolds girls or
kill volume conclusive proof that
he is now a fashion victim
He has also challenged kgus to
a squash tournament where they
are to proceed in getting
themselves well and truly stuffed (no
bias involved whatsoever).
The Grudge Match
A football match, played on
November 29th, has been
announced. It is between Focus (ex-
Argus MD Peter Welham's new
company) and Argus (the
publishers of this ﬁne magazine, and
Deputy Editor Rik Henderson's
former employers). It has been titled
'The Grudge Match' by the
challengers, and unless they decide
to ﬁeld a team of footballers for a
change, will be quite tame. We'll
keep you up to date.
