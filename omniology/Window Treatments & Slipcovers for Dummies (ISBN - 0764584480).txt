About the Authors
Mark Montano is best known as the lead designer on While You Were Out,
the hit designing show on TLC, which he joined in 2003. It’s one of the most-
recognized and best-loved home redesign shows on television.
Well before While You Were Out, Mark began designing clothing for his
mother at the age of 14. After graduating from Colorado State University
(where he earned a bachelor’s degree in business), Mark moved to New York
City, where he continued his education at the Fashion Institute of Technology,
earning a master’s degree in costume history. An internship at Oscar de la
Renta gave him an appreciation for exquisite fabrics and the inspiration to
begin his own clothing line.
He opened his flagship boutique in New York’s East Village and established
himself in the world of haute couture. As the youngest member ever to be
inducted into the Council of Fashion Designers of America, Mark designed a
signature collection of ready-to-wear and custom couture for more than ten
years, which was shown to great acclaim on the runways of New York’s
Fashion Week.
Mark joined the staff of Cosmo Girl! magazine as a contributing editor in 1999,
where he began a monthly room makeover column called “Cool Room.” In
early 2002, Mark continued inspiring teens with the publication of his first
book, Super Suite, a collection of room makeovers for 15 teenage girls, which
was selected for inclusion in the “Books for the Teen Age 2003 List,” pub-
lished by the New York Public Library.
He also writes a weekly column entitled “Make Your Mark,” syndicated in
more than 70 newspapers by Knight Ridder, in which he answers a wide
range of readers’ decorating questions. In August 2004, Mark began work as
a feature columnist in the New York Post’s home section, where his column
“Mark Your Territory” tackles city-living design problems.
Mark’s book, Dollar Store Décor, was published to great acclaim in 2005, and
he’s currently hard at work on a new TV show, TLC’s 10 Years Younger. He
lives in New York City and Los Angeles.
Carly Sommerstein attended New York University, where she studied English
and American literature. She has worked as a freelance book editor for more
than 13 years. Her writing has appeared in the NY Press, the Utne Reader,
Jane, www.playboy.com, and elsewhere. She also collaborated with Mark
Montano on Super Suite. Carly lives in the New York City area with her hus-
band and two-year-old son.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
So many people had a hand in creating this book, and we want to extend our
deepest thanks and lasting gratitude to every one of them. Thank you, Diane
Graves Steele, vice president and publisher, and Mikal Belicove, acquisitions
editor, for coming up with the concept for the book and for giving us the
chance to execute it. Thanks to Janet Rosen, our adorable and energetic
agent, and Sheree Bykofsky of Sheree Bykofsky Associates, for their faith and
on-going moral support. The great Jeremy Nelson did the interior photogra-
phy, and the fine folks at Kreber in Columbus, Ohio, provided the color-insert
photos; thanks and kudos to you both. Many thanks to the graphics depart-
ment at Wiley, who created this book’s line drawings.
The project editors and copyeditors of the publishing world are rarely given
their fair due. These diligent, highly organized, and creative multitaskers con-
tribute hugely to the final product. Thank you, Chrissy Guthrie and Sherri
Pfouts, for your amazing brains and for your dedication and encouragement
during the shaping of this book from start to finish. Copyeditors Chad Sievers
and Neil Johnson corrected our spelling and syntax and made many smart
comments and suggestions that helped a great deal. We also want to acknowl-
edge the helpful contribution of our technical editors, Carol Spier and Sandra
Rea, for going behind our work and pointing us in the right direction.
Mark thanks his parents for helping him to think out of the box, Jorge
Montano for his organizational skills and good cheer, and his cowriter Carly
Sommerstein.
Carly thanks her late grandmother Betty Liner, a talented seamstress and
fabric lover who first exposed her to creativity with cloth. Thanks to her hus-
band, J.R. Taylor, for his unconditional love and support. She also thanks her
mother-in-law, baby genius Barbara Taylor, and Sherylann Matthias, her
amazing nanny, who both helped to care for her son, Judah Ray Taylor,
during the writing of this book; it truly does take a village. And thank you,
Mark Montano, for your sense of humor and giant talent. It’s a pleasure to
work with you and an honor to be your friend.

Introduction
W
e’re delighted to welcome you to our take on window treatment and
slipcover design. If you’re bored with what’s being offered to you in
the stores and want to take a crack at doing it yourself, you came to the right
place. We think making your own window treatments and slipcovers is the
perfect way to express your individual style, to make a room truly special and
entirely your own. This book provides you with our formula for a little style
magic: We provide several fun ideas to jazz up your windows and furniture
and explain step by step how to make them come to life. All you need is some
money, time, and effort, and before you know it, you’ll be creating beautiful
window treatments and slipcovers for which you’d pay an interior decorator
a king’s ransom (not to mention bragging rights!).
As soon as you get the do-it-yourself bug, don’t be surprised if you scoff out
loud at all the store-bought home decorating products, their inflated prices,
and their listless design quality.
About This Book
Window Treatments & Slipcovers For Dummies is a book for everyone — from
those of you who don’t own a sewing machine, and don’t want to, to those
who are learning the ins and outs of sewing, to those of you who have some
good basic sewing knowledge that you want to flex a bit, to those of you who
have been sewing for years and want to pick up a few new design ideas. We
include useful background knowledge and practical information on choosing
materials (such as fabrics, trims, and hardware), tips on planning your con-
struction, as well dozens of step-by-step projects that you can create as is,
or adapt to your design needs.
We wrote this book so you can make window treatments and slipcovers easily
at home and in the style you love. We conceived and translated into writing
many projects that don’t require any sewing knowledge, for those who want
to create without sewing, and many projects that only require rudimentary
sewing knowledge. We wish we had the time and space to give you a sewing
tutorial for each project, but that just wasn’t possible. If you want to attempt
an “advanced” sewing project that we offer, but feel that your sewing skills
aren’t quite up to snuff, we encourage you to pick up Jan Saunders Maresh’s
Sewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, (Wiley) which shows you all the basic step-
by-step sewing concepts and techniques, and some fun projects, as well.

Conventions Used in This Book
We want to take a minute to point out some conventions we used when writing
this book:
 To get you started on the right foot, each project begins with a formula
for figuring out how much fabric you need to cover your particular
window or piece of furniture. We also always provide an example, so
that you can see the math in action.
 In addition to addressing fabric needs upfront, we also provide a list of
needed tools and materials before each project. We arrange these lists
of supplies alphabetically, not in their order of importance. Making sure
you have all your tools and supplies handy before you begin a project is
essential.
 We simplify many standard sewing practices to make this book as acces-
sible and easy as we possibly can. If you’ve been taught to sew in a way
that contradicts our advice, certainly do what makes you the most com-
fortable. But consider trying it our way. We’ve thought it all through, and
we believe our suggestions will work out great for you and your room.
Mark has been sewing for decades and really knows his stuff!
 Anytime we introduce a new sewing, fabric, or decor term, we italicize it.
 We bold all keywords as well as the steps in a numbered list.
 Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to help them
stand out.
What You’re Not to Read
Of course, we’d love for you to read each and every word of this wonderful
book — after all, we wrote it! However, if you’re not interested in all the
details and just want to get to the heart of each project, you can skip the
sidebars, which are shaded gray. Sidebars contain good-to-know but
nonessential info, so they’re totally skippable if you want to do so.
Also, any paragraphs marked with the Nice to Have icon are skippable as
well. These paragraphs point out tools and gear that are (you guessed it) nice
to have but not necessary to complete the project successfully.

Window Treatments & Slipcovers For Dummies 

Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and your needs:
 You want to be able to create great-looking rooms without having to first
achieve seamstress status. (Although for some projects in this book, we
do assume that you at least know your way around a sewing machine.)
 You want a wide range of style choices to fit many different rooms.
 You’re looking for tips, shortcuts, tricks, and smart advice — from soup
to nuts — to lower your frustration level down to zero (or at least pretty
close to zero).
 You want to start making window treatment and/or slipcover projects to
spiff up your rooms right away.
If any of these assumptions fit the bill for you, welcome to our world and to
this book!
How This Book Is Organized
We organized this book into five parts so that you can quickly and easily find
what you want.
Part I: Window Treatments & 
Slipcovers 101
In this part, we talk about planning your window and slipcover projects
including how to determine your style, your color likes and dislikes, your
fabric choices and where to shop for them, and information on hardware and
“softwear” for your windows and furniture. We also give advice on what tools
you need and how to create a useful workspace.
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap
The chapters in this part deal exclusively with the easiest no-sew and low-
sew window treatments — everything you need to know about measuring,
cutting, and creating simple curtains, draperies, and shades. We cover the
3
Introduction

wonderful world of window treatment accessorizing, so you can personalize
your creations. We also offer some helpful timesaving shortcuts and quick
fixes in case you find yourself in a jam.
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy
This part shows you all about simple no-sew or low-sew slipcovers and how
to calculate your fabric needs and measure properly so you can cover nearly
any piece of furniture in your home. We offer some advice on adding acces-
sories, such as trims and other add-ons, to your slipcovers and, as in Part II,
a few shortcuts and plenty of advice on how to melt away mistakes.
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try
Here we offer you four more chapters of window treatment and slipcover pro-
jects. Two are “intermediate” in nature; we assume you have some sewing
skills that you’ll use to make treatments and slipcovers that are a step up
from the really easy ones in Parts II and III. We also include two more-
challenging chapters for “advanced” window treatments and slipcovers.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this part, we give you some practical style advice including our humble
opinions on design tips to help you create a truly special room, as well as
interior design rules that should be broken (we ardently believe that thinking
outside of the box is the first step toward discovering your creativity). We
also offer you a few Web resources so you can find the materials you need at
a great price.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we use icons in the margin to guide you toward impor-
tant points and concepts. Here’s how they break down:
Some tools are essential in creating the projects in this book, and others while
not totally necessary are still nice to have. Check out the information that
appears near this icon; you may find some great timesavers and frustration-
savers.

This icon alerts you to useful information. This information can help guide
you along the creative process as well.
The information next to this icon tells you how to do something in the quick-
est and best possible way.
Make sure you read the text next to this icon. We point it out to help you
avoid various pitfalls and keep your sanity while you’re making a project.
Where to Go from Here
Because each chapter in this book can stand on its own, you can really start
anywhere you prefer. If you want to start with a window treatment, go to Part II
or Part IV. If you’d rather tackle a slipcover, head to Part III or IV. And if you’re
the type of person who really likes to have his or her ducks in a row before
beginning a project, peruse Part I to make sure you know about buying and
using the right fabrics and hardware, assembling a sewing kit, and creating a
functional workspace.
We do suggest that you read Chapters 2, 4, and 6 before you decide on a
window treatment and Chapters 2 and 10 before you decide on a slipcover.
Thinking about what kind of fabric you need and understanding some of the
measuring challenges (and for window treatments, what kind of hardware to
buy) go a long way toward helping you plan your project. After that, you can
jump around from chapter to chapter to see which projects match your skill
level as well as projects that meet your particular design needs.

Part I
Window Treatments
& Slipcovers 101

In this part . . .
P
lanning your new window treatment or slipcover —
or both — and getting all the materials and your
workspace together may seem demanding, but we’re
going to make sure it’s also fun. Furthermore, we promise
that if you take everything one step at a time, you’ll dis-
cover your hidden designer and see your project through
from beginning to end.
In this part, we start off with some style and design
choices to mull over, recommend where to go for inspira-
tion so you can start fleshing out your projects, and pro-
vide a quick overview of construction techniques and
advice on organizing a simple workspace. We tell you all
you need to know about choosing, shopping for, and pre-
treating fabric; deciding on accessories and trims; and
picking (and even making) complementary hardware and
mounting it correctly. We also recommend some helpful
tools that you want to keep around to make your sewing
life a lot easier — and fun.

Chapter 1
Covering the Basics
Before You Start
In This Chapter
 Thinking about color, print, scale, and texture
 Searching for inspiration everywhere
 Choosing your construction
 Creating a workspace and gathering your supplies
“B
ut where do I start?” Many people, even design professionals, have
uttered this phrase when faced with starting a designing endeavor.
Creating something seemingly out of thin air can seem daunting, and you
may even put off starting your project because you feel overwhelmed by
everything. Don’t worry, we’re here to help.
This chapter offers some basic information and helpful tips to keep in mind
when you’re beginning to think about slipcover and window treatment projects
you want to make. From choosing fabric to seeking out style ideas, to thinking
about trims and considering whether to sew or not to sew, to organizing your
workspace and getting your sewing kit together, this chapter is a great place to
start — from the beginning!
Thinking about Color
Do you like light-colored, sheer fabrics for an open breezy feel? Do you like
bursts of saturated color? Are you attracted to the richness of velvet? Fabrics
have unique qualities that can help you express your true style (see Chapter 2
for more).
One of the first things you think about when starting a new design project is
your color choice. Whether you like or dislike colors and combinations of
colors is subjective, but you can rely on a few principles to help you decide
what color/colors work best for your project.

Using the color spectrum
The color spectrum comprises the colors of a rainbow. If you remember your
high school science or art classes, you may recall old Roy G. Biv, which stands
for red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The warm colors — red,
orange, and yellow — register in many people’s eyes as advancing. They make
an area look larger, tend to impart energy and vigor, and are at the left side of
the color spectrum. The cool ones — green, blue, indigo, and violet — register
in many people’s eyes as receding. They make an area look smaller, tend to
impart calm and relaxation, and are on the right side of the spectrum.
Black and white are “color-free” colors that go well with warm or cool hues.
Neutrals like beige, tan, cream, and wheat can also be combined beautifully
with either warm or cool hues.
Deciding whether to go cool or warm
Most people choose either warm or cool tones, and stay within the one
family of colors — for example, robin’s egg blue matched with indigo —
which decorators call a monochromatic color scheme, depending on what
kind of feeling they want to impart in the room. Warm tones impart a bright,
happy, stimulating feeling, while cool tones give a calming, relaxing tone.
Bedrooms are rooms where you relax and sleep, so many people favor cool
colors, like blue, while a den and kitchen are livelier spaces that oftentimes
benefit from a warmer palette. Dining rooms are often red, which is consid-
ered an appetite stimulant.
Mixing it up by choosing both
No rule says that you have to stay exclusively within the cool tones or the
warm tones. In fact, we wholeheartedly advocate using both sides of the
color spectrum — what we call the cool/warm paradigm. For example, a
warm orange and a cool/neutral tan always look great together, as do a sunny
yellow and a cool blue. Another winning combination is red (or pink) and
gray, or blue and orange.
We encourage you to add color to your life in ways that please you. But
moving all over the color spectrum with four or five colors that don’t relate
to one another may make the room a bit too busy, creating a space where
working or relaxing is difficult. Stick to two or three compatible colors and
you’ll never go wrong.
Say your existing decor features a brick-red sofa, a white armchair, a light
green rug, and off-white walls. You have one warm element (red), two neutral
elements (white and off-white), and one cool element (green) in your room.
You may decide that you want to move toward the cool family, playing up the
carpet’s color by incorporating another cool tone in your window treatment,
10
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

say, a window treatment in a similar green, or a blue with green tones. Or you
may want to move your decor toward a warmer palette by choosing a cinna-
mon brown slipcover fabric to cover the armchair. Saffron is another color
that looks gorgeous added to warm tones.
Paint samples, the kind on paper that you get at the hardware or paint store,
are very useful to keep specific colors, or families of colors, handy when you
fabric shop. Take a few home and match them to the elements of your decor
you want to keep in mind when you shop. Staple ’em right into a notebook
where you can easily locate them. (Check out “Nearer to thee (your references,
that is)” later in this chapter and Chapter 2 for more on creating a notebook.)
Are you feeling it?
When selecting a fabric for your project , you want to consider how the fabric
feels. Some fabric has a shiny finish, some is silky, some is rough, and some is a
bit scratchy (see Chapter 2 for more on choosing fabric). How does the fabric
feel when you sit on it, lounge on it, and touch it with your bare feet? Do your
family members, especially children, who tend to have more sensitive skin, like
it? At the same time that you’re evaluating the feel of the fabric, consider its
“hand”; how does the fabric handle, drape, or crease? Is it stiff or flimsy?
Although the fabric’s feel applies more to slipcovers than to window treat-
ments, it’s still important for both types of projects that you enjoy handling
the fabric while you’re making your project, because that’s half the fun.
Picking prints
Prints, including stripes, polka dots, florals, geometric shapes, plaids, pais-
leys, sunbursts, and so on, are a terrific way to add pizzazz to a room. Choose
a print whose background color echoes another color in your decor to give
your project and room an extra punch.
When selecting a pattern, consider contrasting its scale with other patterns
in the room. Scale refers to the size of the patterns and how they relate to
other patterns in the room. Add a small check to a large floral print for a tra-
ditional look. Mix a medium stripe with a small geometric print for a great-
looking modern design scheme.
We especially love bold prints with large motifs and recommend them if they
fit your decor. Large prints can provide a nice focal point to your room, like a
design exclamation point. However, they can be a challenge to sew because
you have to match the repeated motif across fabric panels (see Chapter 6 for
more on repeats).
11
Chapter 1: Covering the Basics Before You Start

Particularly with slipcovers, you have to be sure the motif always runs the
correct way across the entire sofa or chair. Our recommendation here and
throughout this book is to use a small, all-over print fabric for creating slip-
covers. It saves you time, money, and sewing frustration, and you’ll be less
prone to grow weary of your slipcover if you take this advice (see Chapters 2
and 6 for more on prints). You’ll find that small, allover prints also impart a
cozy, calming feeling; something about that random repetition is very lulling
to the eye.
Many books, including the one you’re currently reading, urge you to exercise
restraint when you mix patterns. Two or three patterns are plenty. A room
bustling with four or five different patterns can impart an unrestful and chaotic
feeling. You can add visual interest with other elements, such as texture, rather
than inundating the space with too many patterns (see the next section).
Making use of texture
Introducing texture is a great way to add a low-key sense of style. Not everyone
likes a bold or diverse color palette. If you want to work in neutral colors but
don’t want it to get boring, look for fabrics with texture. Woven fabrics — such
as damasks and twills — are wonderful for window treatments and slipcovers.
Fabrics with nap (in this case, fabrics made with raised threads that impart
a fuzzy texture, and which “change” color when brushed one way or the
other) — such as velvet, velveteen, and corduroy —are also good choices.
Quilted fabric, like matelasse, is a nice choice for slipcovers and adds a bit
of cushion for good measure. Faux-suedes add texture and are durable as
well as washable.
12
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 
What’s that smell?
Most people don’t think about the scent of fab-
rics, but if you’re using a certain fabric to make a
slipcover you’ll be lounging or napping on, it may
be an issue, especially for people with sharp
noses. Although some fabrics have a distinctive
odor, others are fairly neutral smelling. Some nat-
ural fibers have inherent scent qualities, like silk
and wool, while others get their odor from the
types of dyes or finishes used. For the latter, laun-
dering doesn’t always get rid of a fabric’s scent
because the dye is impregnated in the fabric and
the finishing processes also contribute to any
aroma the fabric may have. So if you’re worried
that a particular fabric may be too strong
smelling for your slipcover, get a sample, launder
it, and check it. Sniff before you buy!

You can also consider introducing a small bit of texture to the body of a con-
servative-looking creation: Add a pillow or skirt to a slipcover or a tieback or
edging to a window treatment. A little can go a long way.
Uncovering Sources of Project-Planning
Inspiration
Whenever you’re planning a new project, you have a ton of items to keep
straight. On top of all these elements, you also need to find design ideas. Where
do you get the spark of inspiration? This section can provide some insight.
Catalogs and magazines
If you’re like us, you get about a million home-design retail catalogs in the mail
each month. Don’t throw them away. They’re a great place to find inspiration.
Most of these companies also sell a nice array of drapery rods, poles, brackets,
finials, and holdbacks (tiebacks made from hard materials). Take a look at
the different styles to see which ones appeal to you. Some may give you a
few ideas of your own, either to make (see Chapter 8), or to pick up cheap 
secondhand at resale stores, flea markets, or garage sales (see Chapter 4).
If you subscribe to Architectural Digest or a similar magazine, or if you receive
any of the do-it-yourself design magazines — the market now has more than
ever before — you’re sure to find tons of ideas. If you can’t swing a costly sub-
scription, check out the library (your mom would surely approve of this idea).
The good ol’ public library
Books on interior design, architecture, the history of fabric, and fine art
books are all great idea sources, if you’re fortunate enough to have your own
library (Mark has an awe-inspiring one!). If you don’t have one, remember
that another ideal place to search for design ideas is waiting for you right in
your hometown — the public library.
In this digital age, many people often forget how peaceful and edifying libraries
can be. You can really concentrate and evaluate when you’re surrounded by
nothing but quiet. Make the time to “study” there, as you used to do as a kid, if
only for an hour, to find your inspiration (and at the right price!).
13
Chapter 1: Covering the Basics Before You Start

Museums and historic homes
To get a feel for classical designs of the past, museums and historic homes pro-
vide a wonderful opportunity for study and contemplation. On-site curators
verify the historical accuracy and caretakers tend to the design elements of
these places, allowing for a pleasant, informative visit. Meet these profession-
als if you can and ask questions. Be sure to inquire as to whether photographs
are prohibited before taking them.
To locate a historic home that is open to visitors, check out this helpful Web
site: www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com.
Open houses and house tours (also known
as barging in on the neighbors)
When an important (or not so important) home is up for sale, the real estate
office handling the sale arranges a no-invitation visitation time so prospective
buyers can see the goods. These open houses are given to create local “buzz,”
and they usually last for a full weekend. They’re another wonderful (and super
fun) opportunity to get design info.
In a similar vein, some cities offer (for a nominal fee that usually goes to char-
ity) tours of historic neighborhood homes, some of which have been lovingly
restored to their original splendor. It’s an opportunity for the homeowners to
show off their restoration work, and for you to meet like-minded folks who love
house history, and to contribute to a worthwhile cause. Some towns feature
designer showcases of newly constructed homes or holiday-themed tours to
raise money for a community project; these tours may also be a good resource.
If you have some drawing talent, make a sketch of the design detail you want
to re-create at home. Yes, you can whip out your minicamera or cell phone to
take pictures, but please be discreet — you’re still in somebody’s home!
TV and the Internet
TV design shows are rampant. Just turn on your TV (of course, we recommend
the one Mark’s on, While You Were Out on TLC) and see if they’re doing any-
thing you want to try. Write down the name and date of the episode, and later
do an Internet search for that show’s Web site, where you’re sure to find infor-
mation and additional links that can provide inspiration.
The Internet is also a great design resource. Just log on to the Web, type in
the specific design topic — for example, “kitchen valance” — into a search
engine, and happy hunting.

Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

Fabric stores
Visiting a great fabric store with an amazing array of fabric is a wonderful way
to start the process. Sure, we can explain to you what organza or damask or
toile looks and feels like, but until you see it and touch it yourself, you can’t
decide if it’s right for you and your needs. Believe us, the sales help won’t look
at you funny if you spend an hour at a fabric store and buy nothing. Getting
educated about what you like and don’t like about fabric is an important step
in creating the projects in this book.
Some Assembly Required: Necessary
Construction Skills
You have quite a few construction options for making window treatments and
slipcovers. Whether you sew or not is up to you, as we offer a few sewing
alternatives, such as using hot glue and iron-on bonding tape. You also need
to measure with a measuring tape and drape fabric to get the look you’re
seeking.
Measuring makes it right
Measuring correctly is essential to making your creation the best it can be.
Accurately determining your window’s width and length and your furniture’s
width, length, and depth is the first step in determining your fabric needs.
Before you begin any project, take a look at our two measuring chapters,
Chapters 6 and 10, for tips on figuring out how much fabric you need for your
style of windows or furniture. You can also find some info there on cutting
your fabric, making patterns, and calculating your seam allowances.
Folding, draping, tying, and more
Many of our simplest projects call for finessing and arranging fabric by way
of folding, draping, tucking, and tying. In our easy window treatment chapter,
Chapter 7, we talk about using folded throws, draped fabric to create swags
that loop around a decorative rod, and adding clips to create fast and beauti-
ful treatments. In our simple slipcover chapter, Chapter 11, we focus on tuck-
ing, pinning, tying, and draping fabric or even flat bed sheets for a great
covering effect.
15
Chapter 1: Covering the Basics Before You Start

Although they may sound easy, these skills actually take a bit of practice to
get the look you want, so don’t feel discouraged if it takes you a few tries (or
more). 
After you achieve the look you love, you can add a bit of panache with knock-
out accessories. (Check out Chapters 8 and 12 for adding accessories to your
window treatments and slipcovers.)
Sewing (or gluing or bonding)
This book divides projects into three categories: easy no-sew or low-sew
window treatments and slipcovers; intermediate-level projects that require
some sewing knowledge but also offer a few sewing alternatives; and more
complex projects where sewing with a machine is a must and some specific
sewing knowledge is required.
Generally, the easier the project, the less reliant on a sewing machine you need
to be. In some cases, you can substitute sewing with a hot glue gun, safety pins,
or even Stitch Witchery or another brand of iron-on bonding tape. Check out
the individual project chapters for specifics.
Here’s a quick rundown on your sewing choices.
Sewing with a sewing machine
Sewing with a machine is the quickest and easiest way to construct a window
treatment or slipcover. You’ll be folding fabric to sew hems with our fold-and-
fold method (see Chapter 14), sewing straight lines across fabric to create rod
sleeves, joining two or even three panels of fabric together to get adequate
width for your windows and furniture, and sewing fabric pieces together with
simple seams.
A sewing machine is also helpful for sewing on accessories. Any sewing
machine that can sew a straight stitch and a zigzag stitch works fine, and the
ability to reverse to back tack is helpful, but not essential. If your sewing
machine has a zipper foot attachment, you can use it for adding zippers to
slipcover cushions (see Chapter 17).
Sewing by hand
A needle and thread come in handy when you only have to make a few stitches
here and there, for low-sew window treatments, and for attaching buttons,
bows, appliqués, and other accessories, especially delicate trims that your
sewing machine could damage (see Chapters 8 and 12 for more on accessories
and the best ways to apply them). Just remember: Have a few sizes of needles
around for different fabric weights; the heavier the fabric, the thicker the
needle.

Using a glue gun, bonding tape, and more
You also have a few other options besides a sewing machine or sewing by
hand when working these projects. You can use
 A glue gun (a tool that melts a stick of glue and ejects it in a thin stream)
bonds fabric to fabric for a long-lasting hold and is a great alternative to
sewing, especially if you confine its use to an area that you can’t see
after the project is finished.
 Iron-on bonding tape, such as Stitch Witchery, which you use in con-
junction with an iron and pressing cloth, can take the place of sewing
hems at the bottom of your window treatment. You can also use it to
attach accessories, like trims and appliqués. You place this tape
between two layers of fabric and iron over the fabric. The iron’s heat
melts the tape and adheres the two pieces of fabric together.
 Fray Check is a sealant for fabric; it prevents nicks and edges from 
fraying. 
 Safety pins are a terrific way to create no-sew window treatments (see
some of the projects in Chapter 7), and they’re also useful for securing
slipcovers (see Chapter 12).
Check out Chapter 5 to discover more about these handy notions.
Creating a Workspace and
Gathering Your Supplies
Organizing your workspace is an essential step in the creative process. Having
everything you need at your fingertips allows you to work unimpeded and
quickly, not to mention lowering the dreaded frustration level. Here’s all you
need to get it all together.
Your worktable
Did your mom or grandmother have a sewing room when you were growing
up? Who wouldn’t love a room of one’s own, to dream, create, and indulge
one’s senses? If you don’t have a room to set up a permanent workspace for
your sewing projects, what can you do? Don’t panic. You can use any large
table, with just a bit of specification.
17
Chapter 1: Covering the Basics Before You Start

You need a large, flat surface on which to spread out, measure, pin, and cut
fabric, and you need a stable spot for your sewing machine. Because sewing
machines tend to shake, use a sturdy table, such as a strong kitchen or dining
room table. If you’re limited by space as to how large a table you have, set
up an adjacent card table so you have room to spread out your fabric and
so your fabric has a place to rest when coming out of the sewing machine,
especially when you’re sewing large fabric panels.
You also want to cover a smooth-surfaced table with a table pad or secured
tablecloth to keep your fabric from sliding around. If you plan to do quite a
bit of sewing and don’t mind the extra work, consider covering your work-
table with half-inch thick cotton batting, to add some nonsliding padding.
Roll the batting out across the table and secure it by taping it under each
corner of the worktable, or use extra-large rubber bands at the table edges
to keep the batting in place. 
If you’re really limited for space, you may be tempted to try to work on the
floor. We suggest you skip the floor because it’s really hard on your body. But
if you have a strong constitution and the floor is your only option, make sure
you kneel on a pillow, or buy a gardener’s foam pad. You’ll be able to work
longer, and your knees will surely thank you for it! And always tape a large
clean sheet to the floor so your fabric doesn’t pick up any dust, dirt, or dog
or cat hair. We don’t recommend working on a bed; it’s too soft, and there’s
just too good a chance you’ll cut through your bedspread or duvet.
If you’re committed to setting up a permanent sewing space, you may want to
invest in some sewing room furniture. Check out sewing centers, tables, and
cabinets made especially for sewing rooms at www.joann.com.
Let there be light
Adequate light is an essential ingredient for any creative endeavor. If you
can’t set your worktable up near a source of natural light, get a floor lamp or
other large light source with a full-spectrum light bulb so everything — from
the pattern repeat to the selvage edge to the matching thread color — is
crystal clear. Doing so also serves you well if the only time you get to work on
your creation is in the evening.
Bags, baskets, boxes, and more
We understand but don’t adhere to the “out of sight, out of mind” school of
thought when it comes to sewing areas. Keeping everything hidden away may
make for a peaceful-looking room, but we also firmly believe that the better
18
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

you can actually see your trims, buttons, threads, and tools, the more inspired
you’ll be to create. And yes, you can keep all your sewing stuff in an old tool-
box that tucks away in a closet, but finding what you want when you want it
can be a nightmare.
Instead consider storing your supplies in clear shoeboxes or plastic contain-
ers with lids that pop open and plastic bags that zip closed. Clear, partitioned
storage containers with lids, like the ones used to store and separate jewelry,
are great for buttons, snaps, and other small notions. You don’t have to sort
your stuff more than once and aren’t tricked into thinking you don’t have
enough of one thing to complete a project. You also save tons of time and
money because you use up what you have at home and don’t spend several
trips running back and forth to the fabric store buying items you don’t need.
Store your fabric in boxes or baskets away from heat and light and label them
well so you know just where everything goes. Gently fold and don’t overstack
your fabric so it doesn’t permanently crease.
Nearer to thee (your references, that is)
Along with our supplies, we also like to keep our references handy, whether
they’re art books, color samples, or a bunch of photos we’ve torn out of mag-
azines and stored in a file. We keep the loose items in a color notebook so
they’re always close at hand when we shop, and easy to locate when we’re
ready to begin a project. (See Chapter 2 for more about keeping a notebook.)
To keep everything in its place, add a small shelving unit with labels — it can
save you a huge amount of time having everything you need within arm’s
reach. Just slide your basket or box of bobbins into the shelf labeled “bob-
bins” and you never have to dig around for them or crane your neck from
shelf to shelf. Line the back of one shelf with pegboard and you have a great
place to hang your scissors, ruler, and even your cloth measuring tape.
Iron and ironing board
You need your iron and ironing board close by your cutting table because
you need to press seams open while you create. Ideally you can permanently
set up your ironing board so you don’t have to open and close it every time
you use it. To keep your ironing accoutrements handy, get a hanging wire
basket meant for fruit and attach it to any loop-like metal part on the under-
side of your ironing board. You can keep your pressing cloth, water spray
bottle, and even your Stitch Witchery or other iron-on bonding tape right
where you need it. If your workspace is limited, pick up a tabletop ironing
board, but make sure it’s wide and large enough to make your ironing job
easier, not harder.

Chapter 2
Choosing the Right Fabric
for the Job
In This Chapter
 Understanding some fiber basics
 Looking at your fabric choices
 Sorting through fabrics for window treatments
 Selecting fabrics for slipcovers
You need to consider many different factors when determining which
fabric is right for your project. For instance, when choosing fabric for
your bedroom window treatment, you need to determine whether you want
it to darken the room or lighten it. On the other hand, if you need fabric to
cover the family room sofa, you need to discover if it can withstand the test
of time and the rigors of your washing machine — not to mention your kids
and pets. Additionally, you must consider the big-three fabric senses: sight,
smell, and touch (see Chapter 1). And last, but not least, you need to keep in
mind the size of your pocketbook.
Selecting a fabric that meets all these qualifications may not always be easy,
but it’s possible. Just imagine the day you find the fabric with the right look,
smell, and feel to match your project. Add to that accomplishment the fact
that it’s easy to care for, durable, and hey, look . . . it’s on sale! In this chapter
we show you what to look for when choosing fabrics, so that someday soon,
that wonderful day will come.
Factoring in Fiber Content
One of the first things you need to consider when choosing fabrics is fiber
content. Fibers are what provide the respective characteristics of how fabrics
look, feel, and respond to environmental factors. Knowing a bit about how
fibers are joined and how they’re composed can help you make an informed
decision about which fabrics may work for you.

Types of fibers
Fibers are either natural, synthetic (either plant- or chemical-based), or a mix
of the two, called fiber blends. These fibers are spun into yarn, which is in
turn knit or woven into fabric.
Each type of fiber has its own unique traits:
 Natural fibers, such as cotton, silk, linen, or wool, feel soft to the touch,
but often tend to wrinkle and shrink and need more ironing than syn-
thetic materials. Natural fibers also tend to fade in color with repeated
washing, because the colors are dyed in, not chemically sealed in the
way they are with synthetics.
 Synthetic fibers (also called man-made fibers), such as polyester, nylon,
acrylic, and microfibers, are durable and longwearing. The fabrics made
from this type of fiber shed dirt better than natural-fiber fabrics. Best of
all, they don’t shrink.
 Blends, which contain both natural and synthetic fibers spun together,
enable you to get the best qualities of both: dye fastness, durability,
shape retention, longer wear, softness, and drapability.
The fiber effect
Fibers are to fabric what flour is to bread. They’re the major ingredients that
make up fabric. The kind of fiber that is used to make a fabric determines a
number of factors, including:
22
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 
Buying blends
Although you may prefer all-cotton fabric for your
clothes, don’t be a fiber snob with your drapery
and curtains fabric. Natural and synthetic blends
(for example, part-polyester/part-cotton fabrics)
are terrific for window treatments. Not only are
they durable, wrinkle-resistant, and easy to clean,
but they also don’t pill (when bits of fabric break
away and turn into little balls along the surface of
the fabric), they don’t hold stains, and their price-
per-yard is right on the money.

 Care: The fiber you’re considering determines whether your fabric is
easily washable or needs to be dry-cleaned, and it determines whether it
needs to be pressed, or ironed, after you launder it.
 Durability: This factor shows you how sturdy a fiber can make the
fabric and determines whether the fabric is colorfast (the quality of hold-
ing color against the rigors of detergent and water), keeps its shape, and
whether it rapidly fades when exposed to sunlight.
 Texture (or feel): Getting the texture right is more important for slipcov-
ers than for window treatments. The texture can tell you whether the
fabric feels soft enough to the touch and will be comfortable.
 Weight: This factor helps you determine whether your fabric is heavy
enough to cover a sofa or lightweight enough for the type of window
treatment you want.
23
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job
Chronicling the life and times of fiber
Fibers are the basic material used to create
fabric, and different types of fibers go in and
out of fashion. Once upon a time, all clothing
was made of natural fibers like cotton, linen,
silk, or wool, depending on where you lived or
how much money you had. In the 20th century,
however, many fiber innovations came about,
including
 Rayon: The first cellulosic (made of recon-
stituted wood pulp, or cellulose), or man-
made, fiber to mimic silk, rayon was
discovered in the 1920s.
 Nylon: An early synthetic fiber (made of
polychemicals), sturdy nylon soon followed
rayon in the late ’30s.
 Acrylic: An easy-care alternative to wool,
acrylic was big in the 1950s.
 Polyester: In the 1960s, for some, fashion
was all about returning to the earth and all-
natural fibers, but for others, space-age
polyesters ruled.
 Other synthetics: Polyester and other syn-
thetics continued to gain ground in the
disco-bent ’70s.
 Stretch fabrics and microfibers: Remember
those spandex pants? They blossomed in
the ’80s, leading to another elaboration on
the stretch-fabric theme: microfibers.
 Ultramodern microfibers: Ultrasuede is our
favorite microfiber. Many microfiber inno-
vations are common in the fabric scene
today. Some of them have qualities that silk-
lovers can only dream about. They’re more
durable, washable, and resistant to water
stains.
Modern microfibers can be woven into any type
of fabric, from heavy suede-like fabrics to faux
silks. Sometimes they’re so close to the real
thing that you can’t tell them apart. Today more
than 90 percent of the fibers in the world’s fabric
marketplaces are synthetic.

Weighing Your Fabric Options
You can choose from three fabric weights (lightweight, mediumweight, and
heavyweight), although we want to point out that fabric doesn’t have any
hard and fast rules regarding weight. The most important factor in determin-
ing fabric weight is how appropriate it is for the look you’re after and how
comfortable you are working with it.
When choosing a lightweight fabric, pick one that isn’t too slippery or flimsy
if you feel it may be difficult for you to sew accurately; similarly some heavy-
weight fabrics may be a challenge to negotiate for someone without much
experience. We recommend buying a half yard before you commit to be sure
the fabric looks great, gives you the right look, and is easy to handle.
Lightweight fabrics
Lightweight fabrics are terrific for window treatments. Lightweight fabrics
 Let in light, fresh air, and afford a less-obstructed view
 Allow you some design variety
 Give a breezy feel and a sense of movement to a room
 Are usually easy to handle and move through your sewing machine
For example, you can choose a lightweight fabric for one treatment and
add it to another treatment for a layering effect. Silky, lightweight fabric
is great for creating swags (the top part of a window treatment of the
same name that drapes over the top of your window) and cascades (the
part of the swag treatment that descends along the sides of the window
frame). You may also want to consider lighter fabric for casement cur-
tains and curtains with ruffles.
If treated gently, window treatments made from lightweight fabric can last as
long as medium- or heavyweight fabrics (see the next two sections on
medium- and heavyweight fabrics), though they may not stand up as well
against the onslaught of kids or pets. If your home is blessed with sticky
paws and hands that have a tendency to yank or scratch, keep them in mind
when shopping for your fabric.
Although lightweight fabrics work well with window treatments, they’re really
not suitable for slipcovers. They can’t withstand the force of the human
body, and most lightweight fabrics are on the sheer or semisheer side and
don’t provide enough coverage to keep your sofa’s old fabric from peeking
through.
24
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

However, if you want to be a design rebel, you may try lightweight fabrics as
a slipcover for less-used furniture. If you love the look of a delicate slipcover
fabric for an airy, ethereal effect, and you plan to apply it to a bedroom settee
where you mostly lay out your clothes (certainly never doing the full-on
couch potato routine), why not consider a lightweight fabric? Take a swatch
or even a half yard of the lightweight fabric home and see how you like the
effect. Test the fabric to see how easy it is to sew a hem, how the fabric han-
dles in your machine, and if the fabric is substantial enough to hold a sewn
hem and not too delicate and slippery so that it slides off your settee.
Some of the more popular lightweight fabrics include
 Batiste: This sheer, soft, plain-weave fabric is usually made of cotton or
a cotton/poly blend and often features lengthwise streaks because of
the type of yarn used to make it. It’s a nice fabric for constructing sheer
window treatments, and the blend version launders especially well.
Batiste is a simple, inexpensive fabric that works well on a bathroom
or kitchen window treatment, which you can further embellish with a
light trim.
 Challis: This soft, plain-weave fabric usually comprises cotton, rayon,
wool, or a blend of any of these three fibers. Challis is ideal for window
treatments because it offers a good drape and comes in many prints.
Challis also works well for any kind of swag treatment. It blocks light
well, though not totally, but you can add a lining to make it more effec-
tive. It’s a moderately expensive fabric.
 Charmeuse: This soft, woven satin/crepe fabric has an excellent drape,
which makes it perfect for many types of window treatments. We love
charmeuse for an elegant feel for bedrooms. Its face is lustrous, and its
back is dull; you can use whichever side appeals to you. It’s a moder-
ately expensive fabric.
 Chiffon: This very lightweight, inexpensive, sheer, plain-weave fabric
has a nonshiny finish and excellent drape, making it another classic
window treatment fabric to consider. It was once made exclusively of
silk, but now is available in polyester and other synthetic forms. It laun-
ders well and, like batiste, is a good choice for a room where you want a
lot of light, such as a bathroom or kitchen. It also makes for a lovely
swag, or swag and cascade.
 Crepe: This fabric has an all-over crinkly, pebbly, or puckered texture,
the result of a traditional crepe-weaving technique, embossing, or a
chemical treatment. The textured surface can add character to a simple
window treatment. It’s a moderately expensive fabric.
 Eyelet: This fabric features small cutout decorative areas surrounded by
stitching. It’s an appropriate fabric for many types of curtains. A beautiful
type of eyelet to consider for a cafe curtain is broderie anglaise, which is
an embroidered cotton fabric with a pierced eyelet design. Eyelets are
usually all cotton and thus have a tendency to shrink. Pretreat them
25
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

according to Chapter 3 and wash them in cold water, or look for one
blended with a synthetic for easier care. Eyelet is a moderately expensive
fabric.
 Gauze, mesh, and fishnet: What open-weave fabrics, such as gauze,
mesh, and fishnet, lack in fiber content they make up with for with high
style and low cost. They add texture and visual interest to windows while
allowing in light. We love these fabrics for country and beach houses,
where a nautical motif is ideal and privacy is less of an issue. Remember
to keep your treatment panels simple and let the fabric be the star.
When choosing an open-weave fabric for a floor-length window treat-
ment, hang your fabric over a rod or pole for a while, so that the loose
fibers have a chance to stretch out. Doing so prevents the fabrics from
having a pooling effect later, because these fabrics have a tendency to
droop and hang a bit lower than more tightly woven fabrics.
 Lace: Lace is light and always a nice, feminine addition to a bedroom,
powder room, or even a kitchen. Try lace draperies or curtains in rooms
that feature antiques and Victorian-era furniture. Lace ruffle curtains are
always adorable for a girl’s room. The prices for lace vary considerably.
Polyester lace is the least expensive, blended lace is a bit more, and
cotton lace can range from expensive to very expensive.
Polyester lace is easiest to launder and work with, but poly-cotton
blends and all-cotton lace also are available in many widths (for more
about lace, see Chapter 7).
 Organza: A thin, plain-weave, sheer fabric sometimes made of silk and
sometimes made of synthetics, such as nylon and polyester, organza is
often used for wedding dresses, but it also makes a terrific fabric for light
window treatments. Its applications are similar to batiste or chiffon, but
its texture is somewhat stiffer. It’s a moderately expensive fabric to buy.
When working with sheer fabrics, more often is more. Unless you’re
seeking a streamlined, ultramodern sheer treatment, be sure to add two
to three times the measured width so you have adequate fullness and
coverage in your sheer-fabric treatment. Otherwise, your final product
may appear a bit flimsy.
 Plissé: This fabric is usually made from rayon or cotton, and features a
bumpy or blistered effect (made by applying a caustic soda). It comes in
solids and prints and can be semisheer or opaque. Some plissé loses its
texture when washed, so be sure to test a swatch before pretreating
your fabric. It’s moderately expensive.
 Voile: This fabric comes in smooth and crinkly versions with a plain-
weave and a crisp finish. Voile is most commonly made of cotton, but also
comes in silk, rayon, acetate, and wool versions. Some voiles are printed,
some are solid, and most are semisheer. Consider it for a hallway or foyer
curtain. It’s a perfect fabric for bathroom curtains or any spot where a
sheer or light application with a bit of firmness for staying power (against
steam or heat, for example) is appropriate. It’s moderately expensive.
26
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

Mediumweight fabrics
Most decorator fabrics fall into the category of mediumweight and heavy-
weight. Mediumweight fabrics are the gold standard for both window treat-
ments and slipcovers. You can find the most variety of fabrics in the
mediumweight category, so your choices will be very wide-ranging. When
making window treatments, mediumweight fabrics
 Provide privacy
 Block light when used for simple window panels
 Have the weight you’ll need to create treatments with pleats or valances
You can use mediumweight fabric to make swags, as long as the fabric drapes
well. Roll the bolt out to check.
Mediumweights also hold up well for most slipcovers. When making slipcovers,
mediumweight fabrics
 Work for dining room tables, ottomans, washing machine covers, and
other slipcover projects that need a strong fabric, but don’t necessarily
need heavyweight fabric
 Don’t work if the sofa, armchair, or loveseat you’re covering will be
treated roughly
Some examples of mediumweight fabric include
 Brocade: The queen of slipcover fabrics, brocades once were made exclu-
sively from silk and were a favorite of the very rich. Now, however, they’re
made from more affordable synthetics and blends. Brocade is a two-toned
Jacquard fabric, due to its satin-and-twill weave, and comes in many
colors and many motifs. It’s a moderately inexpensive to expensive fabric.
Brocades come in many weights that are appropriate for window treat-
ments, from lightweight for creating flowing draperies, to medium- and
heavyweights for making London and Roman shades. Care for your bro-
cade creations according to its fiber content.
Brocade’s raised design gives a formal, opulent look perfect for living
and dining rooms. Brocade is popular for slipcover use because of its
heavier feel and also because its slightly raised texture and color varia-
tion hides dirt. Some brocades acquire a whole new (softer and drapier)
appearance when washed. It may be worth testing a sample if you think
you want this effect for a window treatment that requires drapability.
 Brocatelle: This silk-and-linen–weave Jacquard fabric is similar to bro-
cade but has a slightly different look. It features a raised design, which is
formed by a satin-and-twill weave, and originally was created to mimic
tooled leather. Like brocade fabric, brocatelle lends a luxurious, formal
27
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

tone, comes in a few weights, and is ideal to use for both window treat-
ments where you want a bit of coverage and slipcovers. Like its cousin
brocade, brocatelle is a moderately inexpensive to expensive fabric.
 Chenille: This fuzzy-pile, velvety fabric is made from a caterpillarlike yarn.
It’s best used for draped and pinned slipcovers. Chenille gives a cushy,
warming feeling to any room, so it’s nice for dens and family rooms.
Your wee ones will especially love to sit on a chair covered with the “little
caterpillar” fabric. A kilim-style chenille, which is flatter and features intri-
cate designs, is also available. Most types of chenille fabric are expensive.
 Chintz: This fabric takes its name from the Indian word chint, meaning
“broad, gaudily printed fabric.” Chintz was a popular decorating fabric
in the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s, and it’s back in fashion today. A plain-weave
fabric with a neutral background and a bright floral print, chintz is usu-
ally made of cotton or a cotton-blend. 
Some chintz has a shiny finish, achieved with a glaze, which is quite
durable and repels dust. However it can lose its shiny finish when washed.
Dry-clean this type of chintz to retain its shine.
The unglazed, nonshiny chintz is called cretonne. Some people prefer the
nonshiny type for slipcovers and the shiny type for draperies; it’s totally
a matter of taste. Either finish-type chintz is a lovely choice for window
treatments or slipcovers, and is moderately inexpensive.
 Corduroy: A cotton or blended fabric part of the velvet family, corduroy
is a pile fabric that features medium-to-wide, three-dimensional vertical-
cut piles called wales. It has a soft luster and is very comfortable to
touch, yet it’s very strong and durable, making it a natural for slipcov-
ers. Another bonus to corduroy: it’s inexpensive.
Choosing corduroy adds texture, warmth, and depth to your decor. We
love corduroy slipcovers and curtains or draperies in a family room
or den.
 Cotton: Cotton is versatile, affordable, and easy to sew. It provides moder-
ate to full coverage, and comes in the widest range of patterns and prints.
If you hate to iron, consider a different fabric instead of cotton. All-
cotton fabrics need to be pressed after you launder them.
You can’t beat using kerchief/bandanna fabric, gingham, and other
printed cottons for creating valances (a top-only window treatment) and
curtains. These simple cotton prints bring to mind the decor of the past
when fabrics were known for their simplicity.
For treatments that call for an informal fabric, such as curtains or
draperies with tab tops (see Chapter 16), printed cotton is a perfect
match. What could be cuter than a gingham valance over a sunny kitchen
28
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

window (see Chapter 15)? A set of cafe curtains in an informal printed
cotton is another kitchen classic (see Chapter 15). Polka dot–printed
fabric is especially nice for a little girl’s room. Bandanna-printed fabric
adds a nice Western touch to your little cowboy’s room, and darker
cotton prints and plaids are great in an older boy’s room, in studies,
and in family rooms. Cotton fabrics are also woven with embellishments.
For a more formal treatment, consider dotted Swiss or claret cotton with
contrasting woven dots.
Formal-looking cotton prints also are available for rooms that require
more drama. These prints tend to be dyed deeper colors and feature
ornate motifs. We love blue-and-white floral prints for a swag and cas-
cade treatment (see Chapter 16) in a dining room. Chintz (see earlier
item in this list) is a more formal cotton-print fabric nice for draperies
and curtains, and its tighter weave keeps light out.
 Damask: Originally made from silk (in Damascus, hence its name)
damask is a mediumweight cotton or cotton-synthetic blend fabric that
is similar to brocade. Damasks are woven on a Jacquard loom in one
color and many have a formal feeling owing to their ornate, large floral
patterns, animal patterns, or Renaissance-era motifs. Damask is also
available in informal and geometric patterns. When damask weaves are
multicolored, they’re called lampas. The range of damask fabrics tends
to be moderate to expensive.
Two important benefits with damask are
• It’s reversible, so you can choose one fabric and use both sides for
a contrasting effect.
• Like brocade, it hides dirt.
 Hand-stitched and embroidered fabric: Always a good choice when
coupled with a simple curtain or drapery design, hand-stitched or
embroidered fabrics are beautiful and really shine through when nothing
distracts the eye. Crewel-worked, cotton-blend fabrics tend to be easy to
work with.
Crewel is a type of embroidery that uses a wool yarn for a highly raised
effect. Crewel comes in a variety of colorful motifs, usually the floral and
vine designs based on the East Indian tree of life designs and their
British interpretation. The fabric upon which the crewel is added tends
to be applied to opaque cotton or linen blends that are quite sturdy and
block light well, so crewel-worked fabric is a nice choice for window
treatments. Try it with a simple curtain panel so nothing distracts from
this beautiful multicolored embroidery. Crewel-worked fabrics from
India tend to be moderately inexpensive to expensive, and most hand-
stitched or embroidered fabric is expensive.
29
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

Crewel usually has to be dry-cleaned, so keep this in mind if you don’t
like trips to the drycleaners.
 Jacquard: J.M. Jacquard invented these types of loomed fabrics, which
include brocades, brocatelles, damasks, and tapestries. All Jacquard 
fabrics feature a complicated pattern woven into the fabric as part of
its structure. The loom on which Jacquards are made controls each
yarn separately, raising it or lowering it to create its unique design
and texture. Jacquards work beautifully with most window treatments.
They’re especially great with formal sophisticated juxtapositions of
treatments like valances and pleats. Jacquards are moderately inexpen-
sive to expensive.
 Linen: Linen is a type of fabric woven entirely from linen yarns, which
are made from flax fibers. Many linen fabrics have a loosely woven tex-
ture that allows in light and air when used on windows, yet it’s a strong,
durable fabric. More tightly woven linens that block more light are avail-
able. However, many types of linen are a bit scratchy, so if you’re consid-
ering one for a slipcover, make sure you like its texture. If you want to use
linen for a slipcover, look for blended versions that wear well; a blend
also cuts down on your ironing time. Linen is moderately expensive.
You can also find faux linen on the market, which is less expensive and
easier to care for. Don’t forget that 100-percent linen needs to be ironed
after laundering and creases easily.
 Matelasse: This cotton or cotton-blend, double-woven fabric, usually
woven on a Jacquard loom, has the appearance of being quilted or
padded. This fabric works well as a slipcover fabric for furniture to
which you want to add a bit of softness, or a padded effect. It has a tiny
bit of stretch to it, so if your measurements aren’t perfect, it’s forgiving.
Matelasses are moderately expensive.
 Satin: Satins come in many forms (natural, synthetic, and blends), and
they’re woven to create a smooth, lustrous surface. Upholstery satin (a
heavier weight than satins used for clothing) is appropriate for slipcovers.
Satins and sateens make wonderful draperies and curtains. Satin’s finish
is shiny, while sateen’s is somewhat duller. Their beautiful texture adds
a touch of luster and glamour to any room. When choosing this type
of fabric for its draping quality, be sure to unfurl the bolt quite a few
yards and test it well, because not all satins and sateens drape well
(see Chapter 7 for a discussion on drapability). Synthetic and blended
satins tend to be moderately expensive, while natural satins can cost
more.
 Silk: Draperies made from silks look fabulous, and we’re equally enam-
ored by unfinished silks, such as doupioni and shantung, that feature
gorgeous, shiny finishes with natural nubs that give them texture.
Regardless of your preference in finishes, all these silks drape beautifully.

Many medium- to heavyweight silks are available for use in draperies;
however, using silk has three drawbacks:
• It’s costly.
• Water can easily damage it (watch those spotting raindrops!).
• It tends to degrade when exposed to the sun more quickly than
other fabrics.
You may want to consider lining silk to protect it from sun and water
damage so that it lasts longer.
Many silks come in synthetic versions. Four nice alternatives to silk are
rayon, cotton-rayon blends, viscose, and acetate. They all
• Mimic silk’s unique (silky) texture that is perfect for drapery 
treatments
• Cost much less
• Hold up better and are less prone to sun and water damage — so
your creation should last longer
 Taffeta: This plain-weave, tightly woven fabric is made from silk or syn-
thetics and has a smooth, crisp texture, making it a good choice for
draperies. Silk taffeta is moderately expensive in price and is smooth
and shiny on both sides, making it a natural for window treatments that
tie back to expose their underside. It comes in a variety of truly gor-
geous prints and colors, and the polyester versions are very well priced.
Because taffeta is shiny, it reflects light, making the room seem larger
and brighter. Keep this pretty fabric in mind for small rooms you want to
appear bigger than they really are.
 Toile: A cotton fabric printed with one-color depictions of 18th- and
19th-century life, toile is similar to chintz, but it’s unglazed, so it doesn’t
have the same shiny finish. Toile de Jouy (a town in France) features his-
toric scenes of (especially) French country life; federal toile features
scenes from 19th-century America, and toile de Indy shows historic East
Indian scenes. Chinese and Rococo toiles also are available. Most toiles
are moderately expensive.
 Ultrasuede (and other synthetic microfiber faux-suedes): Ultrasuede is
a durable and flexible fake suede fabric that is much easier to sew than
the real thing. Use the heavyweight type for slipcovers. Adding a Teflon
sewing-machine foot when sewing Ultrasuede can be helpful (see
Chapter 4). Ultrasuede is the most recognizable brand of this type of
synthetic suede, and it tends to be expensive; less expensive versions
are available, if you find Ultrasuede’s price prohibitive.
Choose mediumweight Ultrasuede (and other synthetic microfiber faux-
suedes) to mimic real suede at half the price and hassle. Ultrasuede cur-
tains are perfect for studies, dens, and men’s offices, because they add a
masculine touch.

Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

Heavyweight fabrics
Heavyweight fabrics add great window coverage. You can use them with many
of the window treatment or especially the sofa slipcover projects in this book.
Heavyweight fabric in window treatments provides
 Superb light blockage, for those days when you want to sleep late
 A great way to keep in heat during the long winter months
 Durability against potentially destructive paws and little hands
Heavyweight fabric is also appropriate for slipcovers, especially those that
get a lot of day-to-day use, such as family room sofas and chairs. When
making slipcovers, heavyweights can
 Provide durability
If you’re covering a piece of furniture that gets used and battered, and
you feel your sewing skills are good enough to handle a heavier fabric,
when in doubt, go heavier!
 Spot-clean and launder well
Heavyweight fabrics are also wonderful for constructing some of the shade
projects in Chapter 16.
Some popular heavyweight fabrics include
 Canvas: This multiuse medium- to heavyweight fabric is made from
cotton and comes in a number of colors and prints. Canvases sometimes
come with brushed finishes, too.
Fabrics, such as canvas, sailcloth, and denim, in light- or mediumweights,
can be a good choice for informal rooms that get a lot of wear and tear,
such as rec rooms, dens, playrooms, or children’s bedrooms. Dark, solid
versions add a masculine touch to offices and men’s spaces while keep-
ing light out when used for window treatments. They’re sturdy and laun-
der easily. Canvases are priced inexpensively, though some printed
canvas is moderately expensive.
If you’re seeking a fabric for an everyday slipcover that is strong and
firm with a tight weave that repels liquids, is made of cotton, and is easy
to launder, consider a durable canvas in a pretty color. Check the feel of
the canvas by running your hand over it to make sure you’re picking out
a version that is durable but still soft enough to lounge upon.
 Denim: This inexpensive to moderately expensive twill fabric is made
from cotton or cotton blends, and it’s terrific — one of the sturdiest,
long-lived, and practical fabrics. You probably know the navy-colored
version as jeans fabric, but it’s also available in other colors, such as
32
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

white or off-white, which is called drill. Denim washes well and becomes
softer over time. Look for denim with a bit of Lycra added for the stretch
that helps make a great slipcover fit.
Plain cotton twills, such as canvas, sailcloth, and denim, in mediumweight
fabrics, can be a good choice for informal rooms that receive considerable
wear and tear, such as rec rooms, dens, playrooms, or children’s bed-
rooms. Likewise, dark, solid twill fabrics add a masculine touch to offices
and men’s spaces. Printed denim is also available. You can find denim in
many styles, including embroidered, and even Jacquard-woven denims,
which combine the formal and informal in one fabric.
 Duck: A heavyweight cotton fabric that resembles canvas, duck comes
in many colors and a few different weights, and it effectively blocks light.
Just don’t expect any quacking when you use this cotton fabric. It’s ideal
for making shades that require a stiff, sturdy fabric, like Roman and
London shades. Duck is also a good choice for many of the no-sew cur-
tains in Chapter 7, as an alternative to Ultrasuede or other faux-suede
fabrics. Duck comes in solids, stripes, patterns, as well as a number of
weights. A beautiful duck fabric can be the basis for a sophisticated bed-
room treatment because you can add trims to embellish a plain duck.
Another bonus to duck: It’s inexpensive.
 Novelty fabrics: Vinyl (sometimes called faux leather or pleather), faux-
suede, faux-fur, and other alternative fabrics are the way to go for fun,
funky treatments. Faux-fur is either knit or woven in acrylic or
modacrylic to create the fuzzy feel of an animal’s fur. Faux-leathers are
usually made of polyurethane laminate. Vinyls and faux-furs are thicker
than regular fabrics and thus are harder to sew. Keep your treatment
simple when using them for the first time (or consider using a glue gun;
see Chapters 4 and 7 for more). Most novelty fabrics are inexpensive or
moderately expensive.
Children and teenagers usually love novelty fabrics for their bedrooms,
so keep them in mind when treating your kids’ rooms.
 Tapestries: These multicolored, closely woven scenes-on-fabric — some
modern, some reminiscent of medieval art or nature — are a perfect
choice for smaller projects like ottomans and vanity stools. Because
tapestries often can be heavier than even heavyweight fabric (and more
expensive), keep sewing to a minimum and use heavyweight sewing
machine needles.
 Velvet: Made from natural or man-made fibers, this soft yet tough fabric
comes in a special upholstery version that features a sturdy backing and a
deeper, thicker pile than the regular velvet that’s used for making clothes.
Velvet suits any semiformal or formal window treatment, and it’s perfect
for re-creating a Victorian or turn-of-the-20th-century look. It’s a natural
for making rooms of any period with dark wood look extravagant and
expensive. For example, try velvet draperies for dressing up doorways.
Velvet draperies in the bedroom say “va-va-voom” like no other fabric.
33
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

Many weights of velvet are available; chose according to how much cov-
erage and light blockage you require. Nylon velvet is a good choice for
window treatments because of its excellent texture and durability. Most
velvet is moderately expensive and some is expensive.
 Velveteen: Closer to corduroy than velvet, velveteen is woven with a
shorter pile than velvet, and it’s generally made only of cotton. It has
a durable finish and comes in solids and prints. Look for one with twill
backing, because it holds up better with slipcovers. Most velveteen is
moderately expensive, but you can find some expensive versions.
Velvet, velveteen, and other textured or matte fabrics absorb light,
making a room treated with them appear “closer” and smaller than it
really is. Keep them in mind when treating an overlarge room you want
to have a cozier feeling.
Keeping style in mind 
when choosing fabrics
Many tried-and-true, timeless styles are available, from the simple to the
baroque, and many of them even look wonderful when mixed together in
varying types of window treatments and slipcovers. In the following sections,
we give you general descriptions of a few of our favorite styles.
Glamour
When you hear the word “glamour,” many people think of 1930s film stars like
Jean Harlow and Norma Shearer in overdone, fussy Hollywood mansions.
However, a glamorous style can also be contemporary. Glamour is just
another way of saying luxurious, which means using a combination of rich-
looking, well-draping fabrics with cascading, fringed trims for draperies,
and highly tactile fabrics like chenille and velvets/velveteens for slipcovers.
Another hallmark of this style is decorating all in one color, or one tone, for
example, in all white or cream, or all-neutral tones. It gives the room a serene,
almost floating, movie set-like feeling. If you don’t like the feel of white or 
neutrals, another alternative is a muted color palette — rose-toned pinks
instead of hot pinks, for example. To achieve this look, consider lustrous 
fabrics like taffeta and satins for window treatments and Jacquard-loomed
fabrics like brocades, tapestries, and damasks for both window treatments
and slipcovers. Damasks are especially suited for this style because they’re
all one color, though all Jacquards are well suited for slipcovers for bedroom
furniture, such as a settee or loveseat.
The look of a chenille slipcover for a bedroom chair or chaise exudes glamour
and works well not only in bedrooms, but also in dens, libraries, and even in
living rooms.
34
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

Consider adding to your windows any of the valance projects in Chapter 15
or the double swag draperies in Chapter 16. You can also try any of the
throw-type, no-sew slipcover projects in Chapter 12 to achieve an easy yet
abundant, glamorous effect. Simple panels and tiebacks embellished with
beaded trims, as well as swags and cascades with sheers underneath, are
great glamour looks that never go out of style.
Ethnic
Ethnic is a general term for styles that originate in other countries, such as
India, Mexico, Morocco, and others. Although generally not thought of in
those terms, English country style, indeed, is an ethnic style, as is French
country style. (Chintzes and toiles are, respectively, typical fabrics used in
those two styles.)
You can easily bring a touch of the following countries into your home by
way of their hallmark fabrics. These nations are famous either for their
woven textiles, their hand-dyed silks, or their lace. Not all fabric stores carry
ethnic fabrics. Check the phonebook for importers in your area, and call
them to see if they stock fabrics. You can also search online for specific fab-
rics and order them through a reputable Internet source. Some ethnic fabrics
are expensive because they’re hand worked, but some are a bargain.
 Africa: You can add a definite African ethnic touch with intricately woven
fabrics like kuba and kente cloth. These fabrics are truly beautiful and are
still available at a comparatively low cost.
 Central America: The fabrics emblematic of this region are beautiful,
intricately colored cotton weaves that are hand woven in the Mayan
style, which employs a back-strap loom. They come in a variety of
styles, such as huipiles (used for blouses), cintas (used for sashes),
tzutes (used for carrying cloths), and perrajes (for shawls). These fab-
rics from Guatemala and Honduras are gaining popularity and tend to
be a great value.
 Far East: Silks that feature traditional, ancient motifs of the Far East 
(buddhas, pagodas, pictograms) bring China, Japan, and Tibet instant-
ly to mind. If silk is too expensive, look for comparable blends or 
synthetics.
 India: India is a textile mecca and nearly all the fabric imported from
India is well worth exploring. You can find gorgeous fabric that is a great
value.
 Indonesia: Some other typical ethnic fabrics are Indonesian ikat, batik,
kilim-style chenille, and brocades.
 Spain and Italy: Ultrasuede and other synthetic suedes mimic the look
and feel of real suede and bring to mind the rich-toned decors of Spain
and Italy.
35
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

You can add ethnic looks in virtually any room, and you can even incorporate
more than one such ethnic style into one room. For example, the hallmarks of
traditional Mexican decor — ceramic tile, bright colors, rough-hewn woods,
and wrought iron — look great with elements of rustic Italian decor, which
are quite similar in feel.
You don’t have to go overboard with ethnic fabrics to pack a real style punch.
The following are just a few suggestions to help you include some ethnic flair
in any room:
 Add a basic dining room chair slipcover made from a polyester-silk
blend fabric with an Asian motif to an otherwise neutral room, and you
have a beautiful focal point upon which to base Far Eastern decor.
 Mount a rod at ceiling height and allow your fabric to drape in a way to
accentuate a room’s architecture. Rooms with dormer windows or
unusual shapes are great for expressing an ethnic feel. Try draping
fabric in doorways to create an ethnic look, or for creating classic
Oriental room elements, like ogees.
Any simple panel made from an ethnic fabric adds style to a room. Try
the fray-bottom draperies for an exotic feel or the cafe curtains to bring
to mind French country life, both from Chapter 15. Customize the simple
Ultrasuede panel curtains in Chapter 7 with special cutouts.
 Cover an ottoman in a remnant or smaller piece of unique, ethnic fabric
to add an ethnic tone.
 Embellish window treatments and slipcovers with colorful trims and 
tassels. Doing so brings to mind the bright color palettes of Mexico,
India, and other countries; seek out types that echo typical styles of
the region you’re referencing.
When creating larger slipcovers with an ethnic look, seek out one spe-
cial decorative element, such as trim or fringe, that is a hallmark of one
ethnic style, and add it to a neutral-colored slipcover. Not only does the
neutral color allow the decorative element to take center stage, but also
when you redecorate or change your room’s theme, you can just change
the trim for a brand-new look. Check out Chapter 8, where we talk about
alternative tieback ideas, and Chapter 13 for slipcover accessory ideas.
Vintage
The Edwardian, Regency, and Victorian periods are vintage styles, too, but in
this section we’re talking specifically about the period of American style from
the 1930s to the 1950s. Emblematic of vintage style are simple cotton fabrics
that were the standard bearers before wash-and-wear cotton-polyester blends
made ironing a thing of the past for women in the workforce in the 1960s and
1970s. Vintage styles hearken back to an era when Mom was in the kitchen
and the home was a female-engineered haven, with feminine-detailed fabric
to match.
36
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

You can easily create vintage style by buying actual vintage fabrics (although
it’s increasingly more difficult to find fabric of this era in pristine condition
and it tends to be quite costly) or reproductions (see Chapter 20 for sources).
Many of the vintage-look fabrics used for slipcovers are called bark cloth,
which usually is a durable cotton twill or blend with a slightly raised, barklike
texture that features Western, fruit, tree/leaf, or Hawaiian or other tropical
motifs. Some bark cloths that are dyed and not heavily embossed drape well,
so you can consider them for panels in a window treatment.
Another hallmark of vintage styles are the silks and silk blends that once were
referred to as Oriental silks, because they featured traditional or pastoral
Asian scenes or motifs. Printed cottons that feature mid-century designs are a
nice choice for window treatments, as is gingham; all were popular in mid-20th
century America. Lace and kerchief fabrics used as trims lend a vintage flair,
too. These cotton fabrics require a bit of ironing, especially after laundering,
but they’re truly charming. Another classic vintage-looking trim to consider
adding is rickrack.
You can apply the vintage touch to any room, but boxy, square rooms look
especially great when you add the softening effect that’s emblematic of this
style and look. Cotton blends with sweet prints are great for slipcovers in a
child’s bedroom. Bark cloth slipcovers work well in dens, sitting rooms, stud-
ies, living rooms, and bedrooms. The choice is yours, because they come in
so many colors and patterns.
You can take nearly every project in this book and give it a vintage look simply
by using a fabric that gives a 1940s or 1950s feel. A few projects to try to get
that old-time feel include the lace shelf valance with ruffle (Chapter 7), ruffle-
top curtains (Chapter 14), crisscross curtains (Chapter 14), the dining room
table slipcover (Chapter 17), and, of course, the washing machine slipcover
(Chapter 16).
Crafty
Crafty is the term we use to convey handmade quality. Crocheted, knitted,
embroidered, and other hand-stitched fabrics, with plenty of cute detailing,
are the essence of this style. Some simple (and less expensive) crewel-worked
fabrics also provide a nice crafty touch, as do fabrics that feature cross-
stitched borders and motifs and stencil work that mimics embroidery. You
can create a truly one-of-a-kind look whenever you use fabric that has been
embroidered to match a prevailing motif in your room.
Embroidery is a fantastic way to create that adorable, crafty style that’s so
popular these days. Your machine may have embroidery capabilities; if not,
check out Chapter 20, where we recommend a source for buying iron-on
transfer patterns for adding embroidery.
37
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

Crafty style is great for kitchens, dens, and kids’ rooms, but you can always try
it in your home office to offset the “all-work, no-play” style. You usually find
most hand-embroidered fabric in smaller quantities so it’s best applied to
smaller slipcover projects, such as an ottoman or a vanity stool (but if you
can find enough fabric yardage to cover a whole loveseat, then go for it). Try a
large knitted or crocheted throw to cover an armchair; see Chapter 12. For win-
dows, consider crotched fabric for simple swags, like the ones in Chapter 15.
And the Contac paper shade project in Chapter 7 is a fun and crafty no-sew
project that is fun to do with younger family members.
Americana
Sometimes called traditional, sometimes called country, sometimes called
colonial, Americana is a classic look that employs all things down home —
comfy, traditional, and . . . well, American (to decorators in European coun-
tries, Americana is an ethnic style!).
Although great for window treatments and slipcovers in virtually any room,
Americana works especially well in kitchens, dining rooms, dens, and family
rooms or living rooms because of the comfortable feeling it imparts. A tried-
and-true style, it features the use of patchwork fabric, corduroy, flannel,
denim, gingham, and sometimes-busy prints like chintz or toile. Its typical
use of the red-white-and-blue color scheme can be refreshing when done in
new, unexpected ways. This style really complements oak wood furniture or
wood-paneled rooms.
Try the pleated sofa skirt slipcover project in Chapter 17 for a traditional all-
American look. Trim it with an ornamental braid or ribbon. Cover an ottoman
in a red, white, and blue fabric or one that features American images, for exam-
ple, of the bald eagle or an antique scarf that features a state (you know the
kind, with capitol, state flower, and state bird noted). For an interesting infor-
mal window treatment, make simple panels with American flag fabric (or you
may even want to use the real thing) and attach them to a wooden rod with
matching wooden rings. For a more formal room, try an arched valance made
with a printed fabric, like a toile that features scenes from colonial-period life.
Some people are tempted to use another comfortable fabric, jersey (which is
a flat, single-knit fabric), to achieve an all-American style; however, this fabric
tends to stretch a bit and gives when used in making slipcovers. As a result,
your creation doesn’t hold its shape, so avoid using it. Instead, look for
denim or twill with a small percentage of Lycra or other stretch fabric
blended in with the cotton.
Modern
Some call it contemporary and some call it 21st century. No matter what you
call it, modern style is a way of decorating that says “now,” with touches of
classic design elements of the past — specifically mid-century Danish and
38
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

American design — thrown in for good measure. Hallmarks of this style are
furniture in light woods in straight or streamlined designs, bold, graphic
fabric with geometric or modified atomic-age motifs (boomerangs and explod-
ing atoms are the most common ones), and the use of mid-century tones,
such as the combination of medium-light blue, bright orange, gray, and white.
Modern always is streamlined, light, and elegant. It’s sometimes minimalist, but
it still has touches of design whimsy through use of color. Modern always fea-
tures a total absence of flounce: no “extra” fabric or baroque embellishment.
Because it lacks froufrou, this style is ideal for men’s hangouts, such as dens
and libraries, as well as living rooms and boys’ bedrooms.
Vinyl, Ultrasuede, and other synthetic leathers are hallmarks of the modern
look. In their present incarnations, these fabrics never have been better con-
structed nor have they ever been easier to work with. They come in really
terrific colors, too. Although they can take a bit longer to sew, their knockout
effect is worth the extra effort.
Try vinyl to cover a stool or ottoman, and Ultrasuede (or any other microfiber
that mimics suede) to create a basic slipcover for a chair or sofa. Making the
car wash curtains in Chapter 7 is a great way to add fabric without a lot of
flounce: The fabric hangs down and brings to mind mod 1960s design. Try it
on windows or in doorways. For example, a Roman shade in a simple cotton
duck is a streamlined and effective way to keep light out.
Examining Window Fabric Essentials
You have tons to think about when deciding on fabric for window treatments.
Choosing the correct weight, texture, light-blocking or light-exposing qualities,
and the fabric’s durability are just the beginning. You also want it to look fan-
tastic, don’t you? In this section we discuss these qualities and cover a few
applications so you can make the treatment you need and love.
Considering window fabric details
Wrap your head around these concepts for a few minutes before deciding on
your fabric. If you spend some time considering your options now, when it
comes time to look at dozens of fabrics at the store, you’ll have a clearer idea
of what will work best for your specific needs.
 Durability: This issue is important when considering fabrics for window
treatments. Over time the sun can damage all fabrics, but silks are espe-
cially prone to sun rot. Consider lining silks to prolong their life (see our
lined drape project in Chapter 15). Some of the window fabrics least
prone to sun rot are chintzes, brocades, and cotton canvas.
39
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

 Thread count: One factor that makes a fabric stronger and last longer is
its thread count, which is basically the number of yarns (the threads) in
the warp (the lengthwise threads) and weft (the widthwise threads).
Generally speaking, decorator fabrics have a higher thread count than
fabrics used for making clothes, so decorator fabrics last a bit longer.
Some of these fabrics need to be dry-cleaned; check the fabric bolt tag
or cylinder tag.
 Weave: The weave of a fabric contributes to its look: Plain, twill, satin,
or damask weaves are common ones for decorator fabrics. Most printed
cottons are plain or twill weave. For example, satin weaves are used to
create stripes in some fabrics, and a damask weave is a single-color, pat-
terned weave. 
The way a fabric is woven also contributes to its durability; generally,
the more tightly woven a fabric, the more durable. More tightly woven
fabrics also keep light out better, so keep that in mind when shopping.
 Width: Fabric generally comes in two basic widths: 42 to 45 inches and
54 to 60 inches. Always check out the fabric bolt label or tag to deter-
mine its width. Home-decorating fabrics compared to fabrics used for
clothing are in the wider width. You can also find some decorating fab-
rics that are 72 to 75 inches wide, 90 inches wide, and even some that
measure 105 or 110 inches or wider.
If you’re dressing a small window, fabric width isn’t that much of an issue.
However, when you need to treat a large window or a bank of a few win-
dows, lack of fabric width can become a problem. We recommend that
you limit your search to the widest fabrics available. Our advice doesn’t
mean that you can’t sew beautiful draperies with 45-inch-wide fabric. Just
remember that if you choose to use that width that you’ll spend more
money and take more time. In order to get adequate width, you have to
sew two or more widths of fabric together. If you’re using a sheer fabric,
you need more fullness and more width to achieve that look, too. Check
out our Yardage Conversion Table in the Cheat Sheet in the front of this
book to understand how moving across the range of fabric widths works.
When joining two or even three pieces of fabric together to get adequate cov-
erage for a window treatment, remember that if you choose a printed fabric
with a medium- or large-motif pattern, you need to match the pattern repeats
from panel to panel. Unless you feel comfortable in your sewing skills, stick
with a solid fabric, or choose a small, nondirectional (all-over) pattern. We
discuss matching prints a bit later in this chapter in the “Picking prints care-
fully” section. See Chapters 6 and 10 for more on this topic.
Meeting your design needs
Still not sure what kind of fabric to choose? Here are a few familiar window
treatment situations and recommendations for picking the right fabric.
40
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

A bank of wide, long windows that need plenty of coverage
Fabrics with some heft to them will meet your coverage needs. Make simple
floor-to-ceiling panel draperies in a heavier-weight fabric, such as velvet, vel-
veteen, corduroy, or a wool-blend fabric that limit the light. An alternative is
to line your draperies with cotton duck.
For a less formal room, try crisscross curtains (see Chapter 14). When their
tiebacks are removed, you’ll get double coverage when one curtain falls over
the other. For a more formal room, try pleated draperies (see Chapter 15) in a
mediumweight cotton or blend.
A bank of wide, long windows where not much coverage is needed
A swag and cascade (see Chapter 15) made out of a nonsheer fabric with great
drapability, such as a silk or blended charmeuse or a silk alternative (see the
“Mediumweight fabric” section earlier in this chapter), that frames the top and
sides of a bank of windows is a perfect treatment to provide some dress-up
without much coverage. If you want to use a sheer fabric to diffuse the light,
choose panels in gauze, batiste, organza, chiffon, or even lace.
A small room with drafty windows
Your design task is two-fold, but not that hard to solve. Think about adding a
drapery that covers the window in its entirety. Measure your drapery so that
it extends well past the window’s trim molding. Then choose a heavier fabric,
such as damask, in a color that matches (or closely matches) the room’s paint
color. The window treatment helps block cold air. Matching the fabric with the
room’s walls gives the room-enlarging illusion of unbroken wall space.
A very low-ceilinged room
Measure your draperies so they extend from the floor to the ceiling and
match their color to the wall color. Be sure to install the curtain rod nearly
flush with the ceiling. This classic decorator’s trick creates the illusion of
height in a room. If you want to let in light, choose a fabric whose texture is
very light yet crisp, such as voile. If you like coverage, choose a tightly woven
cotton. Using a fabric that features vertical stripes is another nice way you
can create a feeling of length and height in a low-ceilinged room. Because the
stripes are vertical, you can easily match the fabric panel to panel.
A small window, the only source of light in a small kitchen
If you have a small kitchen with only a tiny window, you want to maximize the
window as much as possible. Consider adding a simple valance, or if you have
the ceiling height, an arched valance (see Chapter 14) in the mediumweight
fabric of your choice. Doing so enables you to take advantage of the light
while still adding a bit of flourish without overwhelming the smaller window.
For privacy in the evenings, you can add a simple roll-down shade, mounted
out of sight under the valance for daytime. Another alternative is our double
41
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

cafe curtain project in Chapter 14, which doesn’t overwhelm a small window.
Consider choosing a mediumweight fabric, such as gingham, challis, or toile,
for cafe curtains. They have adequate weight to hang properly.
Blah-looking windows in a formal dining room that doubles as a study
Balloon valances (see Chapter 14) look great over sheers in dining rooms,
and this treatment lets in adequate light for dining, working, or studying
while adding a bit of design pizzazz. Choose a fabric with a tight weave and
even a bit of stiffness when creating balloon valances (like chintz or taffeta),
so they’ll keep their shape. Nobody loves a limp balloon!
A bathroom window that needs privacy but still needs natural light
Some sheer fabrics are too sheer to do the trick. Try a heavier voile or plissé,
which both give a bit of coverage, yet let in some light too. Plissé fabric
comes in solids or patterns. Create a simple curtain panel (like the casement
curtains in Chapter 14) with this fabric, and your problems are solved. When
considering plissé, test a sample before pretreating; some plissés lose their
texture when washed.
Slipping into a Comfortable,
Sturdy Slipcover
Choosing a fabric for your new slipcover doesn’t have to be a chore. A beauti-
ful fabric — in a medium- or even a heavyweight, with a texture, pattern, and
color you like, and the durability factors you need — is out there waiting for
you. This section can help you decide which one is right for you.
Making an informed slipcover
fabric choice
Think about these factors when you begin to decide on your slipcover fabric.
If your head starts to spin when faced with myriad choices, having the basic
necessities clearly in mind can keep you on the right track.
 Added treatments: Check to see whether the fabric has been treated
with a stain- or flame-resistant or other type of finish. Some people like
these additives and the utilitarian qualities they bring; others hate the
smell that these additives can impart. Added treatments aren’t an issue
for window treatments as much as they are for slipcovers, because you
don’t lounge on your windows. If you have a chemically sensitive family
member, read the bolt or cylinder tags carefully.

 Colorfastness: Choosing colorfastness is something to keep in mind. If
your slipcover will be exposed to the sun all day, you want to pick a light
or neutral color, which fades less quickly than a dark or bright color.
 Texture: Texture is an important issue to think about, because you’ll be
sitting and/or lounging on your slipcover. Linen is a traditional choice for
slipcovers, but it may be too scratchy for your taste. Shiny fabrics such
as satin and chintz reflect light and add a feeling of brightness, but they
can be cold to the touch. Dull, matte, or napped fabrics such as wool or
wool blends, velvet, and chenille are cozier and softer, but absorb light,
so consider going for a brighter version of the color you have your heart
set on. Crisp and stiff fabrics don’t mold well to curves in your furniture,
so avoid them unless the piece you’re treating is all angles and lines. Very
soft or sheer fabrics may be too slippery. Take home a sample — or even
a full yard — of your fabric and get to know it before you decide.
 Washability: If you’re blessed with the pitter-patter of little feet —
human, canine, feline, or otherwise — you need a miracle fabric that
hides dirt, food, and fur, or one that’s easy to throw in the washing
machine — sometimes even once a week. Plain or patterned denim,
canvas, or even some types of tightly woven Jacquards may be just what
you’re looking for. Check the bolt tag on any fabric you’re considering to
determine its washability.
 Weave: A fabric with a tight weave stands up to everyday usage better
than a loosely woven fabric. It keeps its shape and repels dirt and stains.
Test for a tight weave by holding it up to the light. If you have a sample
at home, pull at either side to determine how much give (notable move-
ment of fibers) it has.
 Weight: One of the most important things to look for in slipcover fabric
is the correct weight. Deciding on a light-, medium-, or heavyweight
fabric (refer to “Weighing Your Fabric Options” earlier in this chapter for
details) is partly a choice based on the function of the slipcover and
partly a choice based on how comfortable you are handling and using a
sewing machine with different weight fabric.
Cotton or cotton-blend fabrics, such as chintz and toile or a silk or
cotton damask, are easier to work with in mediumweights than in heavy-
weights; choose them for a less-used, formal area. A slipcover for a well-
used piece of furniture — your family room or den sofa — might last
longer in a heavier fabric, such as denim, corduroy, velvet or velveteen,
or even brocade. If you don’t feel confident in how you or your sewing
machine will handle a heavyweight fabric, try a mediumweight version
of a tight-weave fabric, such as denim.
 Width: Fabric width is important to keep in mind when you’re making
your choice. Decorator fabrics come in a standard 54- to 60-inch width,
but you may be able to find fabrics even wider, in some cases 105 to 110
inches wide. Narrower widths are usually reserved for clothing, so we
can’t recommend them for large projects because of the cost.
43
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

Other important factors to consider
Some fabrics, although simply gorgeous, for one reason or another just aren’t
cut out for making slipcovers. Some fabrics split, tear, or stretch when you
actually use your furniture. Others are quite expensive and thus may be pro-
hibitively expensive for covering an entire loveseat or sofa when you’re on a
budget. However, some great fabrics are available for making slipcovers, and
you need to be able to find one that suits your needs.
In general, we recommend the following fabrics wholeheartedly for slipcovers:
 Cotton or blended denim or duck
 Cotton, polyester, or blended brocades and brocatelles
 Cotton or polyester chenille
 Cotton or polyester velvet
 Cotton velveteen or corduroy
 Printed cottons, such as toile or chintz
 Silk, cotton, or blended damask
 Tapestry fabrics
 Ultrasuede or other faux-suede microfiber
 Wool or wool blend
However, you need to size up your own needs and wants and factor them into
your final decision.

Spicing up your sofa with seasonal slipcovers
You can give your sofa a new look every time
the seasons change. Making three or even four
different seasonal slipcovers for one sofa isn’t
only stylish, it’s economical. What at first seems
like an inordinate amount of work (and an
expensive financial proposition) may actually
turn out to be a cheap and easy solution to the
dreaded problem of looking at the same old sofa
year in and year out or a stylish way to protect
a valuable antique. Making a few slipcovers is,
of course, cheaper than buying new sofas and
much less hassle than moving them in and out
of a room (not to mention storing them). And
because you’ll be rotating slipcovers every
three or four months or so, the slipcovers will
last a long time.
For spring, you may want to choose a light-
weight fabric with a pattern that reflects the
renewal of nature. For summer, a crisp, light
solid may work. For fall/winter, a deeper-toned,
heftier fabric works, because most people tend
to spend more time inside (and in the couch-
potato position) during colder months.

When creating reversible slipcovers (see Chapter 17), always select two fab-
rics of equal weight. If the weights of your two fabrics are different, your slip-
cover may not hang properly nor launder well. Your best bet is choosing two
colors or patterns from the same fabric family, for example two denims, one
printed and one solid.
Coordinating your colors
Your furniture slipcovers need to complement your room, of course, but they
also serve as a style element with which you can elaborate on a theme. You
can echo colors from elsewhere in the room or break out with something bold
and different yet still harmonious. Pick a color palette that matches your room
and generally stay within its parameters, or pick out another color entirely
based on the cool/warm paradigm we talk about in Chapter 1.
Color intensifies when you use a lot of it. For example, the fabric you’re con-
sidering for covering a small stool or ottoman won’t elicit the same effect as
the fabric you choose for a full-size sofa or a prominent armchair. Remember
this concept especially when choosing “in-between” colors, like chartreuse
(part yellow/part green), magenta (part pink/part purple), or fluorescent
colors. A little of these colors goes a long way, so you may want to use them
as trims or accents instead of as the main color choice.
Some people shy away from light-toned fabric for slipcovers because they
think they show dirt, and they avoid white like the plague for the same reason.
In our way of thinking, the dirt is still there even if you can’t see it, so you may
as well deal with it so why not go with a light-toned fabric if it fits your palette.
If you choose a good-quality, washable cotton fabric, for example, you can use
color-safe bleach or bleach alternative to remove stains without fear.
Keep a color notebook — which is just a blank notebook with samples of the
paint colors you’ve used in your rooms and swatches of fabrics you’ve used
to decorate. If you can’t get fabric swatches, consider attaching a Polaroid or
clear close-up photographs of your furniture, or better yet, the whole room.
Your color notebook can help you match your new fabric to the colors you
already have in the room and your house. (You don’t have to spend a lot of
money on your color notebook. You can simply use a spiral notebook, some
tape or glue, a pen to label the samples and swatches, and presto!)
Picking prints carefully
If you’re creating only one slipcover for your sofa, we recommend that you
use a solid fabric (or a subtle, petite-scaled print). You won’t get tired of a
solid as quickly as you will a print, and you can always change accent pillows
on a solid slipcover for a brand-new look.
45
Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Fabric for the Job

Working with medium- or large-scale prints, stripes, or plaids can be a sewing
challenge. Matching them from panel to panel, and especially on furniture
where you must sew a curvy seam is difficult and you’ll probably have to buy
more fabric to do it right. However, if you prefer using a print, keep in mind
that prints can be one-way or nondirectional:
 One-way means the pattern only looks right when viewed one way. For
example, a blooming rose with a stem underneath it only looks right
when viewed with the blossoms heading north and the stem heading
south. You have to lay your fabric out so that each piece is cut this way.
When joining two pieces of fabric together to make a wide panel, you
need to make sure the spacing between the roses is always consistent.
 Nondirectional means you don’t have to look at the print from any cer-
tain direction (for instance, polka dots). Choosing a nondirectional
design is better. When you pin and tuck fabric, you get a cohesive look.
When you cut and sew with a pattern, you don’t have to worry about
matching motifs.
If you want to try a medium-size print with the tucked-and-pinned pro-
jects in Chapter 11, we recommend something like an alternating 1-inch
stripe with two colors, because it results in a funky, multidirectional
effect that’s fun.
For projects where you have to match pattern parts, like those in
Chapters 16 and 17, matching medium- or large-scale prints on a
loveseat or sofa can be very difficult. You need to be skilled at matching
patterns at their seams and plan ahead of time where they fall within
each section of your sofa. Each time you position your pattern, make
sure the fabric underneath is identical to the previous pattern. We dis-
cuss this concept a bit more in Chapters 6 and 10. For more information
on working with one-way patterns, see Sewing For Dummies, 2nd edition,
by Jan Saunders Maresh (Wiley).
Uneven stripes and uneven plaids are tough to match for slipcovers.
Unless you have a bit of experience with “unevens,” look for fabric
where all the stripes are the same width (use your tape measure if
you’re not sure).
To find out whether a plaid design is even, fold the fabric in half the long
way and then turn back a corner, so that it’s folded on the bias. If the top
and bottom layer form mirror images of each other, you have an even
plaid, and if they don’t, you have an uneven plaid. The same goes for
stripes.
If you choose a print with a small pattern, say, a half-inch or so, you’ll have
better luck matching each pattern piece or section of your slipcover. However,
if the repeat is larger, say 2 inches or even 4 inches, you have to make sure the
repeats match, and to be able to do so, you may need to buy much more fabric.
Keep these factors in mind when you’re choosing and shopping for fabric. (See
Chapter 10 for more on measuring fabric with prints.)

f you haven’t spent a bit of time thinking about the fabric type that’s per-
fect for your project, then check out Chapter 2. If you have, the next step
is to go out, find it, and acquire the correct amount at the right price. Equally
important is caring for your fabric before you begin to sew, as well as after
your project is complete.
In this chapter, we discuss the ins and outs of selecting fabric at a variety of
stores, and offer you some alternative fabric sources, as well. We give some
advice on figuring out your fabric needs and tips on sticking to a budget. We
also recommend some unconventional fabric sources and tell you what you
need to know about pretreating, washing, and drying your fabric.
Gathering Info — At Home
and at the Store
Spending time browsing in fabric stores to familiarize yourself with fabrics
can be fun and edifying. It can also help you formulate your decorating plan.
But when you’re ready to buy, it pays to arm yourself with the necessary
information.

That’s why we say that the simple maxim “Know before you go” is essential
when making fabric choices. If you can plan at home and decide beforehand
what style, color, and texture fabric to buy, you can make your job much
easier and much more fun, not to mention time saving (you don’t have to go
back again and again) and space saving (no stacking fabric in a closet for
“future” projects that you may never make).
Figuring out what you need
Having the answers to these questions in this section in mind (or jotted down
in your color notebook; see Chapter 2) before you go shopping for fabric
for window treatments and/or slipcovers can save you time, money, and 
frustration.
For window treatments
This list of questions can help you narrow your search for the perfect fabric
to treat your windows.
 How much light do you want to allow in, or how much do you want to
keep out?
 Do the windows you plan to treat face north, south, east, or west?
If the window is in a bedroom and faces east, you may want a heavier
fabric to keep the sunlight out for those mornings when you want to
sleep in.
 Does this room accommodate temperamental sleepers?
 Do you want to filter, but not block out light?
 How much privacy do you need, and will the room you’re treating bene-
fit from a bit of noise control?
A heavier, fuller treatment ensures privacy, as well as muffles outside
elements.
 How much weight can your window and decor support?
A small room with a small window benefits from a treatment that is, you
guessed it . . . small! A room of grander proportion and large or long win-
dows does well with a more dramatic treatment.
For slipcovers
The following questions can help you as you decide on appropriate fabric to
cover your furniture.
48
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

 How do you plan on using the slipcover?
• Will you nap on it each Sunday? If so, make sure you love the feel
of the fabric you choose.
• Will your pet climb on it or child play on it? If so, make sure the
fabric is durable and doesn’t snag on toys or pet’s nails.
• Will you just be placing clothes or lingerie on it? If so, consider a
lightweight fabric, as long as it offers enough coverage so the origi-
nal design doesn’t peak through.
 How often does this slipcover need spot-cleaning, and how often a real
wash?
Some slipcovers require more cleaning because they’re used more often.
For example, slipcovers for dining room tables get food on them, and
people snack on den sofas in front of the TV, but ottomans will probably
receive fewer stains.
 How committed are you to working with a printed fabric?
Matching medium or large prints can be a challenge for a novice.
For both
The following are important considerations to contemplate whether you’re
creating a new window treatment or a slipcover, or both. If you plan to match
your window fabric to your slipcover fabric, read on.
 Which tones or colors in your room decor do you want to echo with the
window treatment or slipcover?
If you make this decision early on, especially whether you’re going for a
solid or a print, you can narrow your search considerably. (See Chapter 1
for an in-depth discussion of color.)
 Are you sure of the correct amount of fabric for your project, and can
you get more if you need to?
If you do need more, can the store order more for you, or is there another
store location where you can get additional yardage? Keep in mind that
dye lots vary. (The vats in which fabrics are dyed are supposed to be
consistent, but even the slightest change in dye amount due to minor
human error can make two pieces of fabric with the same style and color
number look quite different.) Make sure if you have to return for more
fabric, that you can match your fabric perfectly. If you can’t, be sure to
buy enough the first time.
 How much fabric can you afford? 
(See “Deciding How Much Fabric You Need (and Can Afford)” later in
this chapter for some great tips.)

Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics

Chatting with your friendly salesperson
Your best fabric-choosing resources (besides this wonderful book) are the
salespeople at fabric stores, fabric outlets, and wholesale establishments
(we talk about these different places in the “Shopping for Fabrics in the Right
Location” section later in this chapter). The men and women who own and
work at these stores are around fabric all day long, and many of them are
very knowledgeable sewers. Some of them are second- or third-generation
fabric folks. Questions you can — and should — ask include
 What’s the widest decorating fabric you stock?
 Can you recommend a sheer window fabric, preferably one that won’t
pill or wrinkle if I need to wash it often?
 How many different weight brocades can you show me? Which is the
thinnest, and which is the thickest?
 Can you recommend a microfiber fabric appropriate for a heavily used
slipcover?
Don’t be afraid to find out something new from professionals. Let them do their
job and show off their knowledge a bit. You may discover something new.
Rolling out the bolts
At the fabric store, don’t be shy about rolling out the fabric bolt (the card-
board flats or round tubes upon which the fabric is stored) and taking a long
look at what you may be buying. Nobody will give you a funny look if you do.
As a matter of fact, most people won’t give you a second glance because
they’ll think you really know how to shop for fabric. The reason for rolling
out the bolts is three-fold. You want 
 To make sure that the fabric has been dyed evenly and consistently,
and that the overall effect of the color is the one you want. You can’t
determine these consistencies with just a foot or so of fabric showing,
so open the bolt wide.
 To check the fabric on the bolt for small holes and fabric inconsisten-
cies. Fabrics with unusual weaves can disguise such flaws, and some
fabrics, such as doupioni and shantung silk, have slubs (tiny irregulari-
ties in the fiber that give the fabric texture and personality) and other
“flaws.” Tightly woven and shiny-finished fabrics (cottons or cotton
blends or sateens) show their flaws immediately. You can probably see
them with 2 or 3 yards showing.
 To see how the fabric behaves. For example, does it drape well (if
you’re creating a swag)? Is it stiff enough to hold pleats in place (for a
pleated treatment)?
50
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

If you choose to accept a bolt of fabric that features more than a few flaws
(perhaps to save money, or because it’s a one-of-a-kind fabric), be sure to
add an additional 5 percent of your total fabric needs to make up for fabric
lost to these flaws. Or you can plan to cover the flaws with appliqués or other
decorative accessories; see Chapters 8 and 12 for more information.
You can see that we’re slightly prejudiced toward only buying your fabric sight
seen (see the sidebar “The risks of buying online” later in this chapter about
buying fabric online). By buying your fabric in person, you can thoroughly
inspect it for any flaws and save time and money in the long run.
Taking some fabric home
When you’re doubting whether a fabric is the right one, ask for a swatch (a
small sample piece) of fabric to take home. Pin or tape the sample to your
window or furniture, and then stand back to admire it. For window treatments,
make sure you view your potential fabric at the same distance at which you’ll
be living with it (for example, from the sofa or dining room table). For both
window treatments and slipcovers, note how the color or colors work with
your decor, how the scale of the print works with any other prints in the room,
and how the light changes the fabric’s appearance throughout the day.
For an even better idea of how a particular fabric will block light, buy a half-
yard, pin it up on your rod or tape it to the top of your window frame, and
stand back. Again, see how the sun shines through it at different times of the
day and consider its color(s) and/or print carefully.
When picking up fabric samples, always copy the name and number of the
fabric, the fiber content, the laundering instructions (if provided), and any
repeat size information (if applicable; this is the distance in inches between
like motifs on print fabrics) from the fabric bolt or tag, and the store name
into your color notebook (see Chapter 2), so you know where to find it in
case you later decide to buy it.
If you’re worried about the care and tending of your future creation, you can
now test it to see how it responds in different situations. For example,
 Pretreat it according to the cleaning directions on the label’s bolt. (See
“Pretreating: A Must for Happy Fabrics” later in this chapter for more
information on pretreating fabrics). Don’t be afraid to test the fabric
sample a bit roughly.
 Splash a bit of water on your fabric samples that specifically call for dry-
cleaning only, and see how incoming raindrops might stain them.
 Add a bit of dirt to your fabric and see how it comes out with spot-
cleaning. Better to know now than later if you don’t want to invest in
high-maintenance draperies or a slipcover that you can’t wash, even
in cold water.
51
Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics

 Check to see how your potential fabric reacts to spilled milk, dog hair, or
any other day-to-day utilitarian challenges it may face. If you plan on
making a drapery-length treatment, especially one that puddles on the
ground, let your child or pet get a hold of it as well, because they’re sure
to find the fabric after it’s up on your windows.
If your favorite window treatment fabric isn’t as functional as you were
hoping, consider lining it with cotton duck, which blocks light and provides
insulation for not a lot of money (see Chapter 16 to discover how to make
lined draperies).
Shopping for Fabrics in
the Right Location
For people who love fabric, seeking it out is one of best parts of starting a
new sewing project. People who horde fabric, always declaring some “future
project” as an excuse for keeping tons of extra fabric around, know how
much fun taking out their fabrics and looking at them every once in a while
can be, then imagining them on a pillow, up on a window, or covering a chair.
You’ve never had as many fabric shopping choices as you do today. In this
section we talk about where to shop for fabric — at fabric stores, outlets, and
online — and what to expect.
The fabric store
The different types of fabric stores range from the high-end store that sells
nondiscounted, expensive, (and sometimes imported) fabric to the low-end
discount store that sells fabric at low prices. Each type has its advantages.
One of the benefits of shopping at high-end fabric stores is that the fabric is
beautifully displayed. You can easily find everything, and fabrics are usually
grouped together by types, so you can contrast and compare a variety of
manufacturers. Low-end stores try to group their goods, but it’s usually a bit
more of a hodge podge. You have to do a bit more exploring to find what you
want, but if you find what you’re looking for, you pay a lot less.
Fabric stores offer literally hundreds of fabrics to choose from the leading
fabric manufacturers. They also offer a mind-boggling array of trims, as well
as all the standard sewing accoutrements, such as pattern paper, needles,
scissors, and measuring tapes. Being able to buy your fabric and trim at the
same place saves you valuable time and money. You can compare colors and
textures at the same time without having to run all over town.
52
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

Fabric stores also offer their customers memo and swatch services. Memos
are larger pieces of fabric that you can borrow (for a nominal fee) and return
later. You can’t pretreat or misuse these fabric samples, so no stretching or
throwing water on them! Swatches are small fabric samples that you can take
home for free. (We recommend, however, that if you think a fabric may be
“the one” after borrowing a memo or taking home a small swatch, that you
purchase a half yard and live with it for a few days. Pretreat it and handle it
as it shall be in its slipcover or window treatment incarnation.
Fabric stores also offer other advantages. Talk with the staff and check out
a fabric store’s Web site for tips and information on sewing classes and spe-
cial guest speakers who can teach you some tricks of the trade.
We really recommend that you buy your fabric off the same bolt, because dye
lots can vary. Fabric stores can be very helpful in the terrible event that you
run out of fabric. Before you panic, go to the store to see if it has more in
stock (keep your receipt so you can refer to the fabric number and color). If
the store doesn’t, a salesperson may be able to call another store or get in
touch with the manufacturer directly.
Fabric outlets
Fabric outlets stock a variety of discounted fabrics — usually at least 30 per-
cent to 60 percent off or more. You can easily identify these stores because
they usually have the word “discount,” “outlet,” or “bargain” in their name.
Some are small and have more of a traditional store feeling, while others have
a big warehouse vibe.
Fabric outlets generally have a decent selection at a discount. When shopping
at an outlet, buy what you need when you see it. Often, if these places run out
of one fabric, it may never come back again. Plan accordingly. These stores
also have a decent selection of trims and other accessories, but they’re usually
going out of production, so get all you need before you leave the store. Outlets
don’t discount notions and sewing needs that don’t go out of style, such as
scissors, pins, and more.
53
Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics
Lifestyles of the rich
You can go to fabric showrooms, accompanied
by a designer or interior decorator only, and
peruse fabrics at your leisure while chatting
with the knowledgeable staff. A fabric show-
room is the clothing boutique version of fabric
buying. Even with the to-the-trade courtesy your
decorator gets, a fabric showroom is still much
more expensive than going on your own to a
store (and nice if you can afford it). The advan-
tages are access to exclusive fabric lines and
expert advice that make your fabric shopping
experience a breeze.

Furthermore, you usually don’t find anything “wrong” with the fabrics the
outlet is selling. To be on the safe side though, check outlet fabrics for minor
damage, such as fading or flaws. In fact, many outlets offer the lower prices
simply because
 They’re overstocked, meaning the store ordered too much (swayed by
some overzealous salesperson, no doubt).
 The fabrics are from last year’s collection.
 The fabrics didn’t appeal to the general public’s taste, and are being dis-
continued to make way for new fabric.
Because stores have to rotate and add new merchandise to keep customers
interested, fabric has a shelf life, just as fashion does.
Look at your trip to a fabric outlet store as an adventure. You’re on the hunt
for the perfect fabric. Wear comfortable shoes because many outlets tend to
be less organized than regular fabric stores. You may spend some time walk-
ing long aisles and digging through bolts and remnant tables in pursuit of the
flawless bargain. After you find that perfect fabric though, the entire scav-
enger hunt will all be worth it.
Also keep in mind that some domestic linen outlets carry brand-name and
designer tablecloths and sheets that are often marked “irregular.” Irregular
items have some slight imperfections that most people don’t even notice. If
something is marked irregular, double-check the seams. You could spend a
frustrating hour trying to get a straight cut only to discover that the manufac-
turer couldn’t get it right either.
54
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 
Scrounging for remnants
Remnants are end-of-bolt pieces that may only
be a yard or two of fabric. Fabric stores and out-
lets put them in piles because they take up too
much room on the shelves, and they sell them
at a low price. They’re the equivalent of Sunday
dinner’s leftovers — still tasty, but insufficient
for a large meal.
The advantage of buying remnants is they’re so
cheap! If you’re making an accent pillow for
your sofa, a remnant may be perfect. They’re
also great for mixing and matching prints, and
for making contrasting tiebacks for curtains or
drapes. If you’re good with the sewing machine,
you can often get your total yardage by adding
up a few smaller pieces. Getting enough to
cover a whole sofa or a large window, however,
may be a challenge.

Online fabric companies
The Internet is another great source for fabric (we recommend a few online
fabric companies in Chapter 20). By doing a search for a specific fabric type,
you may hit on a company that specializes in silks, denims, brocades, or
vinyl, thus simplifying your search. What could be easier than narrowing
down fabrics by style, color, or width with a click of your mouse?
When buying from an online company, be sure it has an excellent business
rating and offers a money-back guarantee. To protect their reputation, quality
online dealers treat their fabric and customers with equal regard. Reputable
online fabric companies always cut your fabric from the same bolt.
Many online fabric stores have a swatch service that we recommend you take
advantage of. They take a few days to arrive, so it does add some waiting to
your project-making timeframe. Ask for swatches of fabrics you’re consider-
ing, so you can confirm that the color or colors you’re seeing on your com-
puter screen are true (usually they’re not). Seeing, feeling, and comparing the
fabrics before you make a big purchase are important steps.
Shopping for basics, such as cotton batting, scissors, and needles, over the
Internet can be very cost effective. Because many of these companies don’t
have to pay the overhead for a storefront, you can get warehouse-style savings.
55
Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics
The risks of buying online
Although you can find some good bargains
while shopping for fabric online, buying fabric
online has all the disadvantages of a computer
dating service. Though you can see the fabric,
or a computer-created version of it, you can’t
touch the fabric, and that may be a deal breaker
for some people. And when the real thing shows
up at your door, it may not be all it’s cracked up
to be.
If you have a bit of sewing experience and are
familiar with a type of fabric and have used it
successfully before, then by all means, shop
online. If you’re a fabric novice and don’t know
quite what to expect from a certain fabric, look
for the contact information on the site and e-mail
or call the company’s customer service repre-
sentative and have a chat about what you’re
thinking of purchasing. Inquire about the return
policies while you have someone on the line.
Some fabric Web sites are just extensions of
“real” fabric stores, another opportunity for
businesspeople to expand their trade. Look for
companies that have been in business for a
number of years. That bit of information ideally
means satisfied customers, which means good-
quality fabric. Only deal with an online vendor
that offers a fabric swatch service, where you
can confirm color, because computer monitors
aren’t accurate.

Other places to find fabric
You may also find that perfect fabric you need for your window treatments
and slipcover at nontraditional locations instead of a typical fabric store. The
following are just a few examples of places to look:
 Flea markets, church bazaars, garage sales, and thrift shops: Visiting
these types of places may be worth your time and money. Some have
fabric for sale, but you can also look at large-size coats, dresses, and other
clothing with an eye toward cutting up and reusing the fabric. You may
find just enough of one fabric (lace on an otherwise hideous blouse, for
example) you love to create wonderful tiebacks — for a couple of bucks!
If you’re fortunate enough to find some beautiful fabric at a flea market,
thrift store, garage sale, or bazaar, an added challenge is finding enough
fabric to treat an entire window or slipcover a chair. However you may
get lucky and find that perfect fabric, and get a fun story to tell when
guests compliment your work, too.
 Indian women’s clothing stores: If you’re lucky enough to live near an
Indian or other Southeast Asian community, you may want to visit one
or a few of the women’s clothing stores in the area, where you can find
an array of colorful sari fabrics. These, long, scarf-like garments are per-
fect for creating swag treatments as well as some simple flat or shirred
panel treatments, such as casement curtains.
While you’re in the neighborhood, check out any fabric stores, where
you’re sure to find some beautiful imported fabric. India is world
renowned for its textile work and with good reason. The handiwork —
beads of all types, tiny mirrors, sequins, and embroidery — is second
to none.
Deciding How Much Fabric You Need 
(and Can Afford)
Finding a fabric in the correct quantity and for the right price can sometimes
be a challenge. Sure, if you waltz into a high-end decorating shop, you can
find scads of beautiful fabrics in abundance, but you’ll also pay through the
nose. The other side of the coin is shopping at an outlet, where the fabric is
the right price, but you may not find one that’s truly special.
The first step to getting the best of both worlds is to understand what you’re
looking at when you pick up a bolt of fabric. You need to understand what
widths fabrics come in and the normal pricing per yard of both high- and low-
end fabrics. Don’t worry. This section can give you several tips and pointers
so your next trip to the fabric store is a successful one.

Sizing up your fabric needs
Fabric is woven in several conventional widths: 36 inches; 42 to 45 inches; 54,
58, and 60 inches; 75, 90, and in some cases, 105 to 110 inches. The narrow
widths are usually reserved for clothing; however, some wonderful ethnic
fabrics are 36 or 45 inches wide.
The fabric bolt, or hangtag on a cylinder bolt, is where the manufacturer lists
all the information you need to know about the fabric, including fiber con-
tent, fabric width, and whether the fabric has been prewashed. Pattern-
repeat length is indicated on the bolt or cylinder tag as well.
If you’re making a sofa slipcover, you definitely want to go with the 54-to-60-
inch width, or if you can find it, 105 or 110-inch-wide fabrics that can save
you a lot of sewing. (Who wants to sew a bunch of small panels of fabric
together?) Always check the info on the fabric bolt or on a cylinder bolt’s
hangtag to determine the fabric’s dimensions, or ask the salesperson to
double-check the width before cutting the cloth. Always remember: As soon
as the salesperson cuts the fabric, consider it sold.
If the fabric you like is made from natural fibers or a blend with natural fibers,
and hasn’t been prewashed, you must allow for some initial shrinkage when
calculating how much fabric you need. To be on the safe side, if you’re
making a project that needs a lot of fabric — a sofa slipcover or even a very
long or wide pair of drapes — adding an extra 3 yards to accommodate
shrinkage is a good idea. For more on this topic, see “Pretreating: A Must for
Happy Fabrics” later in this chapter.
For window treatments
Each project has specific measuring information, but in this section we give
you a quick overview on measuring to help you figure out how much solid-
colored or small-print, nondirectional print fabric you need for a basic
window panel.
The total amount of fabric you need for a window treatment depends on your
treatment’s finished dimension, not your window frame, because most treat-
ments extend past the frame.
To begin calculating yardage for your window:
1. Measure your window treatment width.
You decide where your treatment will extend — to the edge of the frame,
1 inch outside the frame, or even 3 or more inches, depending on the
look you’re after. Measure from the edge of the extension on one side to
the edge of the extension on the other side of the window. Divide the
total in half if your treatment will separate in the middle.
57
Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics

For most treatments that require fullness, the fabric for your width
needs to be 21⁄2 times the width of this measurement.
Add 2 inches if you plan to have 1⁄2-inch side hems, 4 inches if you plan to
have 1-inch side hems.
2. For your length, measure from the top of your mounted rod or pole to
where you want your treatment to end (usually at the sill, halfway
below the sill, to the floor, or farther, if you seek a puddle effect,
where the fabric cascades onto the floor to create the look of, you
guessed it, a puddle).
For your top and bottom hem, double the measurement of your desired
hem depth and add it to the total length. For example, for a 1-inch hem,
add 2 inches.
3. To calculate the heading (the extra, decorative fabric that extends
above the rod sleeve or other casing), if necessary, double the desired
measurement.
For example, for a 3-inch heading, add 6 inches to your length.
Be sure to calculate for any rings or other hardware you plan to use
when figuring total length.
For more information, refer to specific projects in this book, where we talk
about fabric quantities, and check out the measuring information in Chapter 6.
For slipcovers
This section includes an approximate breakdown of how much solid or small,
nondirectional print (that is, no-repeat print) fabric you need for slipcover
projects:
 A large sofa: 10 to 14 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric or 16 to 20 yards of 
45-inch-wide fabric
 A small sofa: 6 to 8 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric or 10 to 12 yards of 
45-inch-wide fabric
 A small table: 5 to 6 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric or 6 to 8 yards of 
45-inch-wide fabric
 A standard-size armchair: 4 to 6 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric or 8 to
10 yards of 45-inch-wide fabric
 A dining room chair: 3 yards of either 45-inch-wide or 60-inch-wide fabric.
 An ottoman: 2 yards of either 45- or 60-inch-wide fabric
If you’ve initially planned to use a 60-inch-wide fabric, but can find only a 45-
inch-wide fabric that really pleases you, just add between 4 and 6 extra yards
of fabric. For a smaller sofa, use 4 yards, and for a larger sofa, use 6 yards. If
you’re lucky enough to find a fabric you like that is 110 inches wide, you’ll
need a little more than half the estimated yardage for the 60-inch-wide fabric
58

estimates in the previous bulleted list. Check out the Yardage Conversion
Table in the Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book for more on going from
one width of fabric to another.
Pricing fabrics
Everyone loves a bargain, and yet sometimes you just can’t get a good deal on
fabric to save your life. Some stubborn fabrics are like that; they’re just plain
expensive. For example, you’re just not going to find silk Jacquards and taffetas
for $5 a yard, not even on a sale day. High-end fabrics, and hand-worked and
beaded fabrics are astronomical in price, and the gamut runs down to low-end
fabric, such as simple printed synthetics and cottons that go for $6 or $7 a
yard. But the truth is you can find some really fantastic fabric great for making
window treatments and slipcovers in the range of $15 to $20 per yard.

Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics
The inside scoop on fabric prices
A few different factors can add up to a higher
cost for your fabrics. Keep the following points
in mind the next time your mouth is gaping at the
price of that precious silk.
 Fiber content is one way that price is deter-
mined.The raw material to make the fabric —
and the source for that raw material — can
result in a high cost. Keeping an insect fed
and comfortable while you wait around for it
to spin its silky web can take some time and
money (though those little guys don’t eat that
much). Even natural disasters can cause a
shortage of natural fibers contributing to the
price. A drought or an influx of hungry insects
can hurt natural fiber production, which can
be passed on to the consumer. Because of
these ever-changing factors, fabrics like real
silk always go for premium rates. A man-
made imitation silk, on the other hand, made
mostly of polyester, has the approximation of
silk without the cost.
 The laws of supply and demand in a free
market can make fabric expensive. A high
demand for fabric raises its cost. Wedding
dress silks are more expensive than other
silks because each year, the world keeps
churning out more brides (and brides-
maids!). In the same vein, if a new fabric
has an exclusive licensing agreement, it will
be more costly than one widely available
and made by many manufacturers.
 Some fabrics are expensive because they
take more time to make. Beautiful brocade
spends a long time on the loom because the
colors and designs are woven in, not simply
printed on. Creating complicated or multi-
colored designs on any type of fabric entails
more man-hours, and guess who gets to
pay for that labor!
 The research behind the material matters.
When considering microfibers, you’re
paying for the investment in research by
chemical companies, and then for the
development of these new fabrics based on
that research. Similarly, when you’re buying
a fabric created by a celebrity designer or
a well-known design house, you’re paying
for their experience, name recognition, and
label.

What you can expect pricewise
In general, most home-decorating fabrics bought at outlets cost from $7 to $25
per yard, with $15 being the average per-yard price for a nice, long-lasting
fabric. Prices per yard may go up or down, depending on where you buy your
fabric, so it pays to shop around. Also, keep in mind that obtaining the fabric
width you need affects your project’s total cost. Table 3-1 shows some per-yard
price averages.

Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics
Sewing on a budget
Sewing up a simple swag made from an inex-
pensive but pretty polyester blend fabric, or
covering a little footstool or smaller ottoman
with a remnant piece of tapestry fabric won’t
break the bank, but what if you’re treating a
large bank of windows or a matching sofa and
loveseat? Most decorator fabrics are gorgeous,
high-quality creations that are built to last, and
many of them have high price tags to match. You
may not be able to, or even want to, dedicate
tons of money to every room in your home. If
you’re on a tight budget, keep these few points
in mind before you commit to fabric:
 Determine the total cost of creating your
window treatment or slipcover at a few
price points before you buy your fabric.
Consider the following costs for window
treatments: fabric price per yard times total
yards needed (including lining, if neces-
sary), thread, trim, hardware, professional
cleaning costs, if any, and any coordinating
treatments that will complement what
you’re making (such as blinds, shutters, or
shades that might go behind your treat-
ment). Also be sure to factor in any tools
(see Chapter 5) you need to buy to make the
treatment, and finally, the cost of your time.
Consider the following for slipcovers: fabric,
thread, trim, any accessories that you may
need (see Chapter 13), professional clean-
ing costs, if any, additional tools, plus the
cost of your time.
 Always buy the best fabric you can afford,
but if your budget is getting tight, consider
a less-expensive alternative. Place the two
fabrics side by side and compare their qual-
ities. Don’t be afraid to ask a fabric store
salesperson and be specific about your
needs: “I like the color, print, and weight of
this fabric. I don’t need a fabric that has
such a lustrous finish or soft feel. Do you
have something very similar to this fabric,
but in a lower price range?”
 Consider fabric value. For special slipcov-
ers, you don’t necessarily need a fabric that
wears well on an everyday basis. If you’re
creating a holiday-only slipcover for your
family room or den that will only be on your
sofa one month out of the year, you can opt
for a less durable fabric that still has a
design that fits the bill. These special-print
or novelty fabrics may be a little more
money than a plain canvas or denim, but
your slipcover will last a long time. What
you lose in cost you gain in value.
 How long will you keep your window treat-
ment or slipcover in place? If you redeco-
rate frequently or plan to get new furniture
in the future, or if the person who occupies
the room you’re treating has fickle tastes
(can you say “teenager”?), perhaps a syn-
thetic version of that opulent silk fabric may
be in order. If you intend to stay put for a
while or even retire in the home you’re dec-
orating, you can feel confident to go with a
fabric that you really love.
 Contemplate the room’s use. Are some
rooms cordoned off to keep pets out? Are
other rooms ones that young children are
prohibited from entering? You may want to
decorate with fabrics that are a bit more
delicate in their care and a bit more expen-
sive, instead of opting for a thrifty, durable
fabric. Also, some rooms are more “public”
than others, such as dining rooms and living
rooms, so you may want to apply more of
your decorating budget there, especially if
you’re required to entertain at home for
business.

Don’t let the higher cost of microfiber make you think you’re getting a heav-
ier fabric. Microfibers are actually much thinner than those of plant- or
animal-derived fabrics, such as wool, linen, and even silk.
Stretching your dollar to the limit
You can see in Table 3-1 that picking a polyester version of a fabric classically
made in a natural fiber can save you some money. However, synthetics aren’t
always going to be cheaper than natural fabrics. Some really fantastic, new-
fangled synthetic fabrics are as costly as silks, and so are some very expen-
sive polyester brocades. The best way to choose well-priced fabric doesn’t
mean choosing only synthetics or naturals, but rather shopping around and
comparing prices. The following tips can help you snag a great deal.
 Consider buying fabric with a wide selvage. Sometimes a bolt of fabric
is reduced in price because the selvage (the right or left finished edges)
is too wide or uneven. If you plan to cover this edge with decorative
trim, or trim it away entirely, an overlarge selvage isn’t an issue. (See
Chapters 9 and 13 for discussions about how to add trim and a bunch of
other shortcuts and quick fixers.) For more ways to find an inexpensive
fabric, check out the “Scrounging for remnants” sidebar in this chapter.
 Try to cut a deal. Sometimes if a fabric is at the end of its bolt, you can
negotiate a deal for the last 2 or 3 yards, which can be really useful and
economical when creating window treatments. For example, you can use
a few yards for creating a contrasting ruffle or tieback, for adding some
extra fabric at the bottom hem for a visual effect, for creating some
needed weight, or for fixing length mistakes (you cut the fabric too short
and need to lengthen the treatment).
The minimum amount of fabric that you can buy is a 1⁄2-yard, no less.
Some stores maintain a 1-yard minimum, so ask first.
 Combine fabrics. Buy an inexpensive but durable fabric for your slip-
cover, and a yard of ornate and expensive fabric for a coordinating pillow
(or two, if you can squeak it out of one yard). The pillow makes the slip-
cover look better, and you’ll have the new, fresh look you’ve been craving.
Cheating with Sheets
If you hate to sew and hate to shop for fabric, but you’re still committed to
trying one or a few of the projects we offer in this book (specifically in
Chapters 7 and 11), think about cheating — with flat sheets! They’re great for
our no-sew and low-sew projects because they offer several advantages:
62
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

 Their edges are already finished.
 They’re usually wide enough to avoid joining several fabric panels
together, which saves you mucho sewing time.
 They’re multifunctional.
You can use the sheets in many different ways. For example, if you have
leftover sheet fabric, you can use it to create a pillow cover or tiebacks
for another set of curtains. If you chose a printed sheet, you can color
copy it and use it as a matte for framing pictures or art.
Sheet sizes are fairly standard, so keep these measurements in mind when
you’re searching:
 Twin sheets: 66 x 96 inches
 Full sheets: 81 x 96 inches
 Queen sheets: 90 x 102 inches
 King sheets: 108 x 102 inches
If you read “Sizing up your fabric needs” earlier in this chapter, you can see
that queen- and king-size sheets are almost twice the width of most home
decorating fabrics, giving you a lot to work with. Sometimes a twin sheet cut
in half to create two panels is enough to treat a small window.
Shop for sheets just as you would unroll a bolt of fabric at the store. For
window treatments, take the flat sheet out of its packaging (or if you can’t,
borrow the display sample), walk over to a source of natural light, and see
how much light spills through.
Depending on where you shop for them, sheets can give you a lot of bang for
the buck, especially the larger-size sheets. Check out our measuring chapters
(Chapters 6 and 11) to determine how much fabric you need. You can usually
buy a very good quality king-size flat sheet for about $35 to $45, which you
can use to create draperies for an average-size window with some fabric left-
over. Also, look out for those seasonal white sales! You can find some great
bargains. (See more info on finding cheap sheets in the “Fabric outlets” sec-
tion earlier in this chapter.)
High-thread count designer sheets are also becoming more affordable,
whereas they were once the privilege of the very rich. Why not consider
using a sheet with a petite pattern and wonderful texture instead of fabric by
the bolt? For a linen look, try an Egyptian cotton sheet. Egyptian cotton has
beautiful draping qualities and works well for swag window treatments (see
Chapter 7). For a tucked-and-pinned slipcover over that needs to fit over a
hard-to-fit or unusually shaped sofa (see Chapter 12), look for sheets with a
63
Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics

synthetic/cotton blend, or even an all-synthetic sheet. Though you may frown
on sleeping on all-synthetic sheets, they may work well for you elsewhere in
your home. In addition, blends and synthetics don’t wrinkle as much.
Similarly, if you’re creating a project that requires a slightly stiffer fabric, say,
to hold pleats, as in our pleated draperies (or the London and Roman shades
all in Chapter 16), very cheap sheets (those with poor fiber content and low
thread counts) found at a bargain store work well. Their fiber content doesn’t
make them comfortable to sleep on, but their stiff texture may be just what
you’re looking for. These same sheets aren’t durable enough for slipcover use
because they’re just too poorly made. 
Pretreating: A Must for Happy Fabrics
Pretreating fabric (sometimes called prewashing or preshrinking) is simply
exposing a sample of your fabric to water before you begin cutting and sewing
it as a way of seeing how your fabric will react. Pretreating helps you decide if
your fabric will be washable or if you’ll need to dry-clean it.
A fabric is only as good as the extent to which it’s prepared for use. Washing
is a necessity, because doing so tells you a great deal about the fabric’s char-
acteristics. Washing a fabric answers these questions: 
 Does it wrinkle or pucker?
 Do the colors run (is it colorfast)?
 Is there significant shrinkage?
Finding the answers to these questions is important before you begin measur-
ing and cutting. 
In this section, we discuss how to fight against frayed edges, the right tem-
peratures in which to wash your fabrics, and why drying and ironing your
fabric before you sew are important steps.
Coauthor Mark Montano firmly believes that you can find out almost every-
thing you need to know about a fabric just by washing it. Simply wash a piece
of the fabric before you commit to washing the total yardage. Washing fabric
beforehand 
 May change the fabric’s finish
 May remove a shine that you would rather keep as a special element of
the fabric’s design
 May loosen decorative threads
 May cause colors to run, even though you used cold water
64
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

Most fabrics that say “dry-clean only” can become washable. You have to
decide if the change or changes that take place during washing are accept-
able to you, in exchange for the freedom of being able to launder. If not, you
need to commit to spot-cleaning and/or dry-cleaning your creation.
Sometimes you’ll be working with fabrics that have already been pretreated
and sewn, such as ones mentioned in the easy window treatment projects in
Chapter 7. You don’t need to wash this fabric. Just care for it according to the
label instructions.
Fighting fraying
Fraying happens when your fabric has cut edges, which is standard with any
fabric that you buy off the bolt. After you’ve tested your fabric sample with
water and determined that you intend to wash it, sew the cut edges on your
sewing machine with a zigzag stitch, or serge (overcast) the cut edges with a
serger. (You can also do this to fabric that you intend to dry-clean, but it’s not
strictly necessary.)
In addition, if you think your fabric runs the risk of fraying during the wash (or
you’ve intentionally bought a fabric for its fraying qualities; see Chapter 7),
treat it gently the first time out by: 
 Washing it in its proper temperature but using the gentle cycle
 Washing it by hand in your bathtub in cool water
 Air-drying your fabric (see the section “Laundering your cherished cre-
ations” later in the chapter)
For small areas that show a bit of wear and tear, such as fragile seam areas,
lace edges, or even an area where your scissors clipped a bit of fabric unin-
tentionally, antifraying fabric sealant, like Fray Check, is a wonderful product.
Apply the sealant with a little brush along the rough edges of the fabric after
washing and air-drying to prevent fraying. For more information about fray-
ing and applying Fray Check, see Chapter 5.
Washing and drying your fabric
The first thing you do when pretreating your fabric is wash it. Washing your
fabric before sewing is important for a couple of reasons:
 You test the fabric’s colorfastness. Colorfastness is simply how well your
fabric holds its colors, and whether they bleed onto one another. Testing
for colorfastness is important — and easy. Cut a small piece of fabric
when testing. You may even want to try to wash it with an old white sock
65
Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics

to see if any of the color transfers. If your fabric bleeds color onto the
sock, or the colors have bled onto the background of the fabric, you’ll
have to commit to dry-cleaning it.
 You preshrink the material. Your fabric will shrink, and it’s much better
for it to shrink now rather than when you’ve finished your creation.
Don’t forget to allow for some initial shrinkage when calculating how
much fabric to buy. Half a yard or so extra is almost always plenty for
a smaller project, like an ottoman or stool; opt for 3 yards for a larger
project, like a sofa slipcover or long drapery.
Regarding the water temperature to use when pretreating your fabric, the old
English expression, “Begin as you plan to go on” applies in situations. Always
wash your fabric the way you plan to continue to wash it in the future. Check
the information on the fabric bolt or cylinder tag and note the percentages of
cotton, polyester, spandex, and the like, and the manufacturer’s recommen-
dations for washing. Write it down in your color notebook (see Chapter 2
for more about staying organized with notebook) if you don’t think you can
remember. Then if your fabric needs to be washed in cold water only, wash it
in cold water during pretreating. If it says you can use lukewarm warm water,
then use warm water the first time.
Always use cold water when you wash washable silks and other delicate 
fabrics.
After you’ve washed your fabric, you obviously want to let it dry completely.
However, hot air is an insult to many fabrics and it’s a culprit in puckering,
shrinking, and thread damage. Some fabrics are dryer friendly, like all-cotton
denims, but others need more time to rid themselves of moisture. Treat your
fabric respectfully; don’t just throw it in the dryer on high heat just to get the
job done quickly. Instead, let it air-dry.
You probably have an “air-only” or “no heat” setting on your dryer, which
means that the dryer only uses air, and no heat, in the drying process. This
setting is fine for most fabrics to dry during the pretreating stage.
Ironing before you sew
Don’t forget to press your fabric with an iron after the fabric is dry. Only after
a good pressing is fabric truly ready for sewing.
Some fabrics still retain their bolt wrinkles or slight lines they acquired from
staying on the bolt for a while. If they’re still present after you’ve pretreated
the fabric, you may want to use a press cloth to make them disappear.
66
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

When choosing a press cloth, make sure it’s light colored to prevent color
transfer, thin so the heat can penetrate to the fabric beneath, and smooth so
no bumps or knobs in the press cloth will mar the fabric beneath. When
you’re ready to begin ironing, follow these three easy steps:
1. Place the press cloth over your fabric.
2. Lightly spray it with water from a fine-mist spray bottle.
3. Iron with even strokes.
You can use many items around the house for a press cloth. A soft thin white
washcloth may work. Mark’s favorite material for a press cloth is a scrap of
clean, thin, white cotton flannel. Some people swear by old cloth diapers.
Caring for Your Finished Products
Treat your finished product as well as you did when it was still a pile of
humble cloth. This section provides a few tips on washing, drying, adding
fabric protectants, and more, all to extend the life of your window treatments
and slipcovers.
Laundering your cherished creations
You probably need to launder your slipcovers more than your window treat-
ments, but we recommend you launder your draperies and curtains at least
once a year. Even if you can’t see it, dust, cobwebs, and grime do build up,
especially on the sides facing the street. If you want your beautiful creations
to last and last, don’t toss them in the washing machine and fill it up with hot
water or throw them in the dryer on high heat. Instead, wash them in the wash-
ing machine under the gentle cycle or launder them by hand in the bathtub.
Air drying helps with the longevity of your fabrics, and if you’ve used any
type of iron-on bonding tape like Stitch Witchery (see Chapter 5), air-drying
helps it stay in its place.
You can air-dry one of two ways:
 Hang your creation up to let the water evaporate naturally over time.
Inside or outside, it doesn’t matter, unless you’ve chosen a fabric that
will be hurt by the sun. If so, dry inside.
 Use the “air-only” or “no heat” setting on your clothes dryer.
67
Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics

If your window treatment fabric isn’t a specialty fabric (by that, we mean it’s
a nonembellished one), or your slipcovers are made from a sturdy,
unadorned fabric, by all means, use the air-only setting. If you have any
doubts about the ability of your creation to stand up to the clanging and
banging inside a metal tube, hang it on the line.
Scotchgarding against stains
Some home-decorating fabrics already come with stain-repellent surfaces. If
your fabric doesn’t, though, you may want to consider trying Scotchgard.
This product repels dirt and spills, and it’s especially great at keeping dry-
clean–only fabrics free of stains to avoid a costly trip to the cleaners.
Scotchgard also makes a cleaner that gently foams away stains, while at the
same time leaving behind a coating of Scotchgard antisoiling agent.
Apply Scotchgard to your finished slipcover or window treatment after it’s
sewn and the trim is on. Follow the instructions on the can and make sure to
test a small, inconspicuous piece of fabric, as well as any trim you plan to
attach, for colorfastness and to see if the fabric’s texture changes (stiffness
may be a problem) before you spray the entire piece. If you launder your cre-
ation, use more Scotchgard to replace what rinsed off in the washing machine.
When using any Scotchgard product, be sure to work in a well-ventilated area,
preferably outside; the fumes can be mighty strong! If you have any chemically
sensitive individuals in your house, you may want to avoid using it.

Out, damned spot! Out, I say
Perhaps if Lady Macbeth would have known
about spot-cleaning, she might not have been
so upset. You don’t have to worry though. If you
have a small stain on your window treatment or
slipcover, and you don’t really want to wash the
whole item, you can spot-clean it.
To spot-clean, you can either use a dry-clean-
ing solution or a very mild, nonperfumed soap or
Woolite and water. The best way to spot-clean
is to first try your cleaning method on a hidden
area of your fabric — say, on a hem that doesn’t
show — and then if the fabric doesn’t change
or isn’t damaged by the spot-cleaning, go after
the stain.
If you discover that your attempt at spot-clean-
ing is worse than the stain itself, take it in to a
professional.

Chapter 3: Buying, Pretreating, and Caring for Your Fabrics
Working with dry-clean–only fabrics
Before you commit to dry-clean–only fabric for
a window treatment or slipcover, take a long,
hard look at your willingness to commit to the
time, energy, and money that’s needed to main-
tain them. Yes, they’re beautiful, but only if
they’re well cared for. 
Don’t be shy about accepting that pretty fabric
from your grandma or great-aunt. Home dry-
cleaning solutions can help! These solutions
are now available over the counter. Now you
can use them in your dryer, saving time and
money. They’re a nice choice especially for not-
heavily soiled fabric that you like, but which has
a peculiar odor. They remove odors, such as
tobacco smoke, mothballs, and cooking
stenches, and impart a nice smell.
A spot-cleaning solution is also available to
apply directly to a specific stain, in case you’ve
bought a slightly damaged or dirty remnant or
discounted bolt of fabric. Always test a swatch
before applying it. Another benefit is that these
home kits work to remove wrinkles from fabric.
Be careful when you use dry-cleaning solution
on chintzes and sateens, because it may take
away the coveted sheen of some fabrics.
Remember to always test a dry-cleaning solu-
tion and its results on an extra piece of fabric.
Note: If you have a stain on one window panel
of fabric, you need to take both panels to the
drycleaners. If not, the dry-cleaned panel will
have a slightly different look than the nontreated
one. The same goes for using dry-clean–only
fabric for a slipcover: If you’re dry-cleaning a
matching pillow, consider cleaning the whole
slipcover too, if you’re a stickler for matching.

Latching On to Hardware 
In This Chapter
 Selecting the right hardware early on
 Looking at your hardware’s characteristics
 Mounting your hardware
 Incorporating “hardware” to your slipcovers
W
hen making window treatments and slipcovers, choosing the right
hardware can make or break your project. Imagine your room as a
giant body that needs dressing. Hardware makes everything “hang right,”
while elaborating on your style and making your project really shine.
This chapter helps you begin to think about the right hardware for your
window treatments and your slipcovers without breaking the bank. We dis-
cuss some of the best hardware choices as well as how and where to incorpo-
rate them to get the look you want — and need.
Why Choosing Hardware
Early On Matters
For window treatments, your first decision is whether you want a hardware
style that is part of the room’s overall look, or one that is hidden away. This
decision partly informs what type of treatment you’ll choose and how it will
be constructed. Your second decision is where to mount your rod, because
you use that information, along with the size of any rings or clips, to measure
your treatment length. For more, see Chapter 6.
Keep these few points in mind regarding window-treatment hardware:
 When rods, poles, brackets, finials, holdbacks, and rings are part of the
window design, you want to match them to one another. They also must
complement your room’s other decor elements (such as the color scheme

and style of your rugs, furniture, doorknobs, drawer pulls, and so on) and
to any existing architectural elements in the room (such as friezes, ceiling
trims, wainscoting, and so on). 
 The position of your tieback or holdback creates a specific look and
determines how much light and air enter your room.
Honing In on Hardware for
Your Window Treatments
Mounting hardware isn’t an afterthought of window design, but rather an
integral part of your window treatment and another decorative element with
which you can create your final look. For example, if you have your heart set
on tab curtains (see Chapter 15), you need to plan for the right kind of rod to
use at the same time you’re thinking of your treatment, because the rod will
show and become part of the overall look. For a swag-style treatment (see
Chapters 7 and 15), much of your pole will show as well.
You also need to consider whether your window treatment has to move or
not. Are you treating a wide bank of windows that you want fully exposed by
day? You can consider a metal pole with metal rings for easy movement. For
a small window whose one-panel fabric treatment can be easily pushed back,
try a swag holder mounted on one side.
Our favorite places for picking up curtain rods and poles are at church bazaars,
garage sales, flea markets, and thrift shops. Keep the dimensions of poles and
rods that you need handy in your color notebook (see Chapter 1 and 2) or a
blank notebook, along with a miniature tape measure. Pick them up cheap,
bring them home, and paint or stain them. You can even wrap them with fabric,
and you’ve picked up your hardware for a song.
Knowing the basic components 
of mounting hardware
The following list includes some of the most common components of mount-
ing hardware for window treatments:
 Rods or poles: You use either a rod or a pole to hang most window 
treatments.
• Rods are made of plastic or metal and usually are adjustable, and
they come in many different finishes including brass, gold tone,
brushed metal, wrought iron, and polished metal. They come in
many shapes: fluted, twisted, rounded, square, and many more.
72
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

• Poles, on the other hand, are usually made of wood, bamboo, plas-
tic, or metal, but aren’t adjustable. Wooden poles come in many
types. Pine and birch are the most common types, and you can
usually paint or stain them if they’re untreated.
 Brackets: Brackets are the supportive holders that keep rods and all poles
in place. They can mount onto walls, window frames, or even ceilings.
Some brackets are purely functional, while others have a decorative life
all their own. Most inside-mount rods (rods that mount inside the window
frame, such as tension rods) don’t need brackets, so this piece of hard-
ware isn’t always necessary. (Check out “Deciding where to place it” later
in this chapter for more on inside-mount and outside-mount rods.)
 Finials: Finials are the end accessories that you add after the rod or pole
has slid into the two brackets and is in its proper place. Finials are both
decorative and functional; they’re attractive and keep curtain rings from
sliding off the rod or pole. (Again, inside-mount rods don’t use finials.)
If you’re working with an outside-mount rod and you decide on ornate
brackets, let your finials match their style exactly, or else let the bracket
shine. You don’t want too many clashing styles to distract from your
window treatment.
 Rings or clips: The last element to add is rings or clips that attach to the
fabric at the top of your treatment and go over your rod or pole.
• Curtain rings have smaller rings at the bottom (where you can sew
your curtain ring to your fabric or add a small hook) or tiny inter-
nal clips (for grabbing onto the fabric). They come in many fin-
ishes to complement your other hardware elements.
• Cafe clips, sometimes called rings with clips in this book, have tiny
clips at the bottom that are often disguised by a pretty decorative
motif, such as leaves, stars, or other shapes.
Many housewares stores that sell hardware carry rods, brackets, and finials in
sets, but you can still mix and match if you want. Buying the sets takes most
of the guesswork out of hardware, but doesn’t allow for a lot of creativity. If
you choose to mix and match, be sure everything works together and comple-
ments each other. Test your rings to ensure they fit over your pole or rod and
check that your finials fit your pole or rod. Also check to see if your choice of
mounting hardware complements a dominant motif of your room or window
treatment. For example, if your damask fabric features a scroll design, see if
you can find a wood or iron bracket that has a similar scroll design. Just
remember: Your hardware elements need to look great and fit great together.
Counting your clips and rings
A variety of curtain-hanging devices are available, and the many clips and
rings all have different qualities. Think about how you’ll hang your treatment
concurrent with its construction and you’ll pick the right ones.
73
Chapter 4: Latching On to Hardware

 Style: When choosing curtain clips, look for something that matches
your window treatment. Curtain clips come in a few styles made from
many materials, including wood, plastic, and metal, some of which you
can further customize with paint.
For instance, are you looking for a charming, rustic look? A dark wood
may work. A modern, streamlined treatment? Chrome metal’s your
ticket. Something romantic and slightly baroque? Perhaps a shabby chic-
style, cracked white-paint clip.
 Size: Clips and rings also come in a few different sizes. Bear in mind that
your clips and rings have to fit over your curtain rod, so buying them
both at the same time is a good idea. (Doing so usually isn’t a problem,
because they’re usually sold right next to each other in sewing supply
stores.) If you can, test them right on the rod before you buy. Check how
well they glide across the rod you’ve chosen.
We’re not advocating that you break into the sealed plastic bags the
clips come in, but perhaps you can ask a salesperson if you can see a
floor sample.
 Weight: Another thing to keep in mind: Are the clips you fancy strong
enough to support the weight of the fabric you’ve chosen for a particu-
lar project? If your fabric is heavyweight, make sure your clips are too.
Figure 4-1 shows a few basic rings to consider.
Choosing a rod that works 
with your treatment
Before you choose your rod or pole, you need to decide if you want a treat-
ment that features the rod or pole as a design element, or if you want your
rod or pole to be purely functional and not visible.

The rods and poles that “show” are
 All manners of metal, wood, and plastic rods and poles with coordinating
finials, brackets, holdbacks, and rings, in styles ranging from historical
reproductions to traditional to modern are decorative
 Specialty rods, such as swivel rods that swing out, which are useful in
treating inward-opening casement windows, doors, and doorways, and
cafe rods, used for cafe curtains
 Swag holders, which are also decorative, and can be used either to
mount swag treatments or used in place of holdbacks
The rods and poles that “hide” are
 Flat rods
 Sash rods
 Tension rods
Sometimes these nondecorative rods are round, sometimes they’re flat,
sometimes they’re opaque (usually white or off-white), and sometimes
they’re clear. Most rods attach with brackets, but you can also find magnetic-
backed rods to use on metal window frames or doors.
After you’ve decided on your style, consider your rod or pole’s functionality.
If you’re creating draperies in velvet or brocade, your rod or pole must be
strong enough to hold a medium- to heavyweight fabric. Additionally, remem-
ber that the pole or rod needs to “match” your fabric on an aesthetic level; if
you’re using a lightweight fabric to create an informal-looking treatment, you
don’t want a rod or pole that overwhelms your fabric by being too thick,
heavy, or formal.
Basic rods for traditional windows and treatments
If you’re creating a traditional treatment for a regular window — a simple
double-hung window or a casement window — these rods will do the trick.
 Cafe rods: These rounded metal tubes mount with U-shaped brackets
and usually are capped with small metal finials on the ends. You can
use them for the cafe curtains in Chapter 14 or any type of curtain that
gathers directly onto the rod. You can also use them with curtain rings
or cafe clips.
 Flat rods: These lightweight rods are called “flat” rods because they’re
not rounded like most rods. They’re great for mounting any treatment
with a rod sleeve, such as valances. Flat rods come in 1-inch, 21⁄2-inch,
and 41⁄2-inch widths. They snap onto metal curtain rod brackets (which
are nondecorative) that are mounted with screws to the wall or window
frame, depending on how far you want your treatment to extend.
75
Chapter 4: Latching On to Hardware

Wide flat rods are just like flat rods, but they jut out from the wall 21⁄2 to
41⁄2 inches, providing drama and room underneath for hanging another
type of drapery. (Check out our description of crisscross curtains in
Chapter 14 for a dual application of two flat rods, which you can also
create with two wide flat rods.) Wide flat rods are made of metal or
clear plastic. The clear plastic is useful when you’re using a sheer-fabric
window treatment. They snap onto metal curtain rod brackets (which
are nondecorative) that are mounted with screws.
 Sash rods: These curtain rods attach to the window’s sash with little
brackets that secure them in place. You can use them for the casement
curtains project in Chapter 14 or whenever you’re treating French doors.
 Tension rods: These rods come equipped with spring mechanisms
inside and little rubber tips on the ends. They’re adjustable and slide in
and expand to mount inside your window, and thus don’t need brackets,
saving your frame a lot of abuse. Use them when you want to show off
beautiful wood frames. They’re also great when you want to show off a
special-shape window, such as a Palladian-style window, whose frames
you don’t want to cover with extra fabric. Tension rods are best used
with lightweight fabric curtains because they rely on a spring-loaded
mechanism, not a bracket, to keep them in place.
Specialty rods for unusual windows and treatments
Some windows are unusually shaped, and some window treatments use a lot
of fabric; both design scenarios would benefit from specialty rods.
 Arched window rods: These rods are rounded so you can mount them
flush to the arch of a Palladian window or other round-type window.
(A Palladian window is a three-paneled wall of windows — the center
window is topped with an arch, and the two outside windows are
shorter and have a square top; see our discussion in Chapter 6 on
unusual window types.) They’re usually clear so you can work with
sheer fabrics, allowing the sunshine in.
 Bay window rods: Try these specially made rods, which consist of three
pieces of metal that can be adjusted to mount at the proper angle over
the three windows that traditionally comprise bay windows.
Not all ceilings, window moldings, or floors are completely square. In
order for your treatment’s fabric to drape evenly, you have to ensure
that your rod is mounted level and not slanted. Get out your trusty 
L-square to verify that your rod or pole is mounted straight.
 Traverse rods: Traverse rods are a little more complicated than the
others mentioned in this list. They’re great for longer, heavier draperies
that can’t conveniently be pulled open and closed by hand. If you’re
using a heavyweight fabric, a traverse rod may be the right one for you.
Because these heavyweight draperies have more fabric, traverse rods
76
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

need more support. In addition to end brackets, you may want to pick
up some additional support brackets, especially if your window requires
a longer traverse rod. You can mount these additional supports every
2 feet or so.
This type of rod is less popular today, because window treatments tend
to be less ornate, but it still has its good points. A traverse rod enables
you to open and close your draperies by pulling a cord that moves
slides along a track that you use to clip or hook your treatment’s fabric
right onto the rod. You can get the conventional type that are concealed
when the drapery is closed or the decorative type that shows when the
drapery is open or closed. Some traverse rods open in the middle of the
window, and some open side to side (to the left or right).
 U-shaped rods: These steel rods are in the shape of the letter U that you
can anchor to the wall above your bed to create a canopy treatment. With
these rods you can introduce the softening magic of fabric to a room. Try
a sheer fabric or match your fabric to your curtains or draperies.
Simple swag hardware
Hardware created especially for swags is often complicated; it includes
wooden, fabric-covered mounting boards, rods with looped-on swag holding
hooks (which look like the hooks with which faltering vaudevillians were
hauled offstage), and other swag-specific devices. (In this book, however, we
try to make your life a bit easier — by including swags that you merely hang
or knot over the decorative rod of your choice and that you don’t need all
that costly, special hardware.)
Nevertheless, one item of swag hardware that you may want to consider is
the swag holder. Swag holders mount to the upper left and right sides of your
window frame. You then drape the fabric through the swag holders (the
holder’s decorative part covers the hole). Swag holders come in heart shapes,
spirals, medallions, flower shapes, and many other configurations. If your
fabric isn’t too heavy, swag holders can replace a decorative rod and can 
support your swag treatment efficiently and elegantly. Match your swag
holder style to your decor for a wonderful, cohesive effect. A variety of plastic
swag holders are also available. They look like a circle with open segments.
You simply pull the fabric through the self-covering segments and create the
swag in the process.
Many knob-shaped metal holdbacks and swag holders are interchangeable,
so don’t limit your swag holder choices based on what their package calls
them. Instead of draping the fabric through a hole, you loop the fabric around
the projection arm of the holdback. Smaller loop-shaped holdbacks may work
on swag treatments, too. Make sure you determine if your treatment features
enough fabric to completely cover the nondecorative mounting area of the
holdback.

Chapter 4: Latching On to Hardware

Installing Window Hardware
Installing your window hardware the “right” way is a subjective concept
indeed. So what’s the only hard-and-fast law in installing the hardware? You
need to install your hardware so that it doesn’t come crashing down if you or
a loved one pulls a bit too hard on the treatment. Otherwise how you hang
your hardware is a matter of choice.
Deciding where to place it
When installing your window hardware, you first need to know whether the
window hardware is inside mount or outside mount.
Inside mount
Inside-mount hardware consists of rod and brackets that sit within the frame
of the window. They don’t need finials because these rods are meant to disap-
pear under the fabric of your treatment.
Choosing an inside mount for rooms such as foyers and half bathrooms can
keep your treatment simple and doesn’t overwhelm a small room. An inside
mount also shows off special window frames by not obscuring them with
fabric.
Inside-mount hardware is easy to figure out. In the case of tension rods, you
can use one, which mounts at the top of the inside of your window, or you
can use two rods for even more privacy: One mounts at the very top of the
inside of your window, and the other mounts at the lowest part of the inside
of your window. In the case of sash rods, they mount on the wooden or metal
sash of the window.
78
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 
Clueing in to curtain weights
Curtain weights can help all kinds of fabric treat-
ments look better, but they’re especially useful
for lightweight fabrics that need a bit more
weight to hang correctly. They come in a few dif-
ferent weights, and they’re not just for curtains;
you can use them to add a little heft to a dining
chair slipcover, so the fabric on the bottom hangs
well. They come in a few styles and are available
at any fabric and crafts store (see our recom-
mended resource list in Chapter 20).

The following are a few other instances where an inside mount may work:
 Corner windows, or a single window placed very close to a corner, work
well with an inside-mounted tension rod.
 Architectural elements above windows or special-shaped windows, such
as Palladian windows or arched windows, often need an inside mount to
show them off.
Inside-mount hardware has its limitations because you must work within the
window frame. Meanwhile, outside-mount hardware gives you more freedom.
See the next section for more about outside-mount hardware.
Outside mount
Outside-mount hardware consists of a rod or pole, brackets, and finials that sit
outside the frame of the window. You decide exactly where outside the frame:
an inch above the top of the frame, 5 inches, or even a foot.
Different outside-mount hardware placements can help you achieve the fol-
lowing looks:
 You can create the illusion of height on a too-short window by mounting
your rod 6 inches above your window frame and adding a long or floor-
length treatment, which draws the eye up and down.
 You can create the illusion of width on a too-tall window by mounting
your rod right above the window frame and adding a valance on a rod
wider than the window width along the top of your window, which will
draw the eye left and right.
 You can allow the maximum amount of light to come in by installing
your rod or pole above the window frame and keeping your holdbacks
or tiebacks higher than the midpoint of your window (see Figure 4-2).
 Instead of a curved rod, which usually has to be custom made, you can
use a series of holdbacks or swag holders placed along the top curve of
an arched or half-circle window. Loop the fabric around the swag hold-
ers, letting the ends drape down the sides. Doing so highlights the
window’s special shape.
 You can consider mounting your rod on the ceiling if the space between
the top of your window frame and the ceiling is limited. Use special
brackets that allow the rod to slide in securely and be sure to use the
appropriate drywall anchors to ensure that the brackets stay firmly in
place.
 You can plan on using asymmetry to create visual interest. By placing
your tiebacks or holdbacks at different positions, you can create a few
different silhouettes (see Figure 4-2).
79
Chapter 4: Latching On to Hardware

How to mount your window hardware
Most hardware comes with mounting instructions from the manufacturer, but
the following tips can also help you mount yours successfully:
 Measure down from the ceiling to where you intend to mount your hard-
ware, because not all windows are plumb and level.
 Use a retractable steel measuring tape to ensure that all brackets are
mounted at the same height.
 Keep an erasable pencil close by to mark where your brackets will mount.
 Install your hardware in the following order:
For rods or poles used with rings, first the brackets go up and then the
rings slide onto the poles or rods. Next insert the pole or rod into the
brackets, and then cap the ends with the finials. Add your window treat-
ment to the rings last. (If you’re sewing your treatment fabric onto the
rings with eyes, do your sewing before you add your rings to the pole
or rod.)
For rods or poles that go through a rod sleeve sewn along the treatment
top, insert your rod or pole into the sleeve before putting the rod
through the brackets, and then attach your finials, if needed.
 Use a stud finder to find the wall studs, which offer a safer anchor for
holding hardware.

Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

 If you’re installing brackets into plaster or drywall, consider using molly
bolts, which expand inside the wall, keeping all your hardware elements
tightly in place.
 When installing into brick or concrete, purchase masonry bolts, which
also expand.
 To mount a rod to the ceiling, measure out from the window frame and
mark your bracket holes with your pencil. Be sure to use molly bolts to
install your hardware safely and securely, because gravity will be work-
ing against your rod or pole.
 If your rod is extra-long, add a center bracket to keep the rod from sag-
ging. Consider using an extra bracket, even if your rod is short, if you’re
making a treatment from heavy fabric.
 Above all, keep safety in mind. Be sure your ladder is secure. If you’re
mounting a heavy rod or pole, double-check that your brackets are
securely fastened and can support your treatment’s weight. If you have
small children in the house, consider metal, wood, or plastic holdbacks
or swag holders instead of fabric or rope-like tiebacks, so there’s no
chance of them pulling or swinging on looped fabric.
Utilizing Slipcover “Hardware”
Some individuals don’t normally think of the words “slipcover” and “hardware”
in the same sentence, but we think they do go together. In this section we sug-
gest a few helpful “hardware” items that can make your slipcover stay in place
and look better.
Using no-slip rubber
No-slip rubber is a type of open-weave rubber that grips flat smooth surfaces
on both its sides. Although many people use no-slip rubber under area rugs,
it can also keep fabric from slipping from fabric. No-slip rubber keeps a no-
sew slipcover from sliding off when placed over uncovered cushions, and it
also keeps slipcovered cushions from sliding off a slipcovered sofa, loveseat,
or armchair. Try it between your dining room table and your tablecloth
instead of a table pad.
No-slip rubber comes in rolls, can be cut with any type of scissors to measure
at home, and is a great alternative to measuring, buying, cutting, and sewing
cotton batting (the stuff traditionally applied to sofas and other furniture to
keep slippage to a minimum).
81
Chapter 4: Latching On to Hardware

Bed stays
Bed stays consist of a length of elastic with two fasteners at each end — usually
snaps or clips — meant to attach to two pieces of fabric. These neat items are
sold under many brand names, and they’re traditionally used to keep bed
sheets tucked in place.
However, why not use them to keep draped slipcover fabric from shifting?
Attach one end to the inside of your slipcover, in the skirt area, or at the back
of the slipcover, and the other to the underside of your furniture, or you can
attach it from one part of the slipcover to another, for instance around the leg
of a chair.
The joys of Velcro
Velcro consists of two interlocking sections that release with ease yet adhere
extremely well. To our minds, it is the greatest stuff on earth! We recommend
its use for our washing machine slipcover in Chapter 16. Many types of Velcro
are available to suit many different types of projects. Choose a lighter Velcro
for lightweight fabrics and heavy-duty Velcro for heavyweight fabrics. Heavy-
duty Velcro lasts the longest and keeps everything in place the best.
You can apply Velcro anywhere that you want a bit of adhesion — in the tuck-in
area of your sofa, on the sides of your ottoman, on the seatback of your dining
room chair, and so forth. If you’re covering an old piece of furniture that will
always be covered, you can apply Velcro right to the old upholstery; just sew
or adhere one side of the Velcro to the furniture and the other to the slipcover.
Though we like the kind of Velcro that you sew into place because it tends to
be thinner and easier to handle, you can also buy the self-adhesive Velcro. It
may be a bit bulkier, but it cuts your project-making time in half. Velcro is
very inexpensive in all its forms; buy a few types and experiment if you want.
Upholstery locks
Upholstery locks look like tiny stainless-steel corkscrews with clear plastic lids.
They’re very useful in keeping draped fabric in its place. They twist into place
and twist out when you want to change or launder your slipcover. Upholstery
locks usually come in packs of 25, which is enough for a sofa plus two chairs.
The holes made by these tiny locks are very small, but they’re holes nonethe-
less. These locks work the best on old furniture or furniture with fabric with a
nap, like velvet or corduroy, into which tiny holes will disappear.

Getting the Right Tools
within Reach
In This Chapter
 Keeping the right tools close at hand
 Adding some cool accessories to your sewing arsenal
Your time is precious — particularly when you’re sewing your window
treatments and slipcovers, so why would you want to waste any of it? To
make the most of your sewing hours, you need to obtain and maintain all the
correct tools together in one place for easy access and use. And knowing all
about those little sewing extras (clips, pins, weights, and measures) means,
believe it or not, less time spent in front of the sewing machine or with a
threaded needle in your hand.
In this chapter, we show you the tools of the trade that you’ll be reaching for
time and again, whenever the creative bug bites you. We show you exactly
what you need to finish your projects quickly and effectively — the first time.
Identifying the Must-Haves
in Your Sewing Tool Kit
In the world of design, you’re only as good as your tools, so be sure to have
top-notch gear. Gather your tools close by you as you work, check them 
frequently to make sure they’re in top shape, and always store everything
together (see Chapter 1 for more tips about gathering your supplies and cre-
ating a workspace). From scissors and measuring tapes to irons and sewing
grids, in this section we provide a list of goods for you to keep on hand to get
you through your projects.

Cutting to the core: Must-have shears
Cutting fabric is both an art and a science, and in the world of Seventh
Avenue, New York City’s fashion district (where coauthor Mark Montano
worked for many years), the fabric cutter is a pro whose only job is cutting
fast and cutting perfectly.
You don’t have to be a pro to cut fabric well; you just need to remember two
important points:
 Take your time when you cut.
 Be sure to have the right cutting tool.
Both can really help you avoid costly cutting mistakes.
We recommend that you have the following two types of cutting tools on
hand (although you may want more):
 Dressmaker’s shears: These special scissors have two different finger
holes: One is round, and the other is oblong. The blades — one is bent
at an angle and one is straight — are very sharp so you can easily push
them through the fabric. The bent-angle blade, controlled by your
thumb, provides a place along the straight blade for your index finger to
rest during long bouts of cutting. The bend also prevents you from lifting
the fabric off the table, making a more accurate cut easier to achieve.
For your dressmaker’s shears, we recommend Fiskars brand shears,
which always are top-notch, precise, and simple to use. Fiskars also
makes scissors for people who are left-handed.
 Pinking shears: This scissorlike device is great for cutting to prevent
fraying (unwanted unraveled threads along fabric edges), which is espe-
cially important with such fabrics as cottons and linens (because they
have looser weaves) and brocades. The edges that result from pinking (a
zigzag cut) these kinds of fabric don’t unravel, thus saving you time and
money and preventing frustration.
Be sure to try a few different types of shears before you buy them. That way
you can find the one that fits your hand the best.
You may also want to keep a pair of embroidery scissors around for light
tasks, such as trimming stray threads, cutting small pieces of fabric, or cut-
ting decorative trims. They’re about 3 inches long and are perfect for getting
into small areas and crevices.
Always keep your scissors sharp. Take them to your local sewing machine shop
whenever you lose that beloved sliding feeling you get while cutting. Sharp scis-
sors ensure that your cutting tasks are a breeze — but watch your fingers!

On pins and needles
To keep your fabric together, sometimes you need to grab pins of different
varieties. Whether you’re using a sewing machine or working by hand, here’s
the skinny on needles that you need to sew your project right.
Extralong straight pins
Extralong straight pins are a must for any sewing project, but they’re especially
important for use in draperies, curtains, and slipcovers, when you’re using
longer pieces of fabric that need the extra stability. We talk about using these
pins extensively in Chapters 7 and 16, where we show you how to drape swags.
Some people swear by a pincushion to keep their straight pins handy.
Cushions are convenient and easy, but you can’t always determine the length
of a pin that you’re pulling out, which can get a bit annoying after a while if
you’re looking for an extralong pin. If you prefer, keep extralong straight pins
close by in a dish or even better, a lidded box, and try a magnet to pick them
up a few at a time (or all at a time if you drop the dish!).
Safety pins
One of the greatest inventions ever is the safety pin. Coauthor Mark is a big
fan of using safety pins rather than straight pins for attaching fabric to pat-
terns so the fabric doesn’t slip, shift, or move. Safety pins not only keep
fabric in place until you’re ready to sew, but in some of the no-sew or low-sew
projects in this book, they also replace sewing entirely. Check out Chapter 7,
where we use 2-inch safety pins for shirring (gathering fabric to create a
pleat) and in Chapter 9 for our shortcuts with window treatments.
Safety pins usually come in two basic colors: gold or brass tone, or silver or
chrome tone. If you choose a project where you’ll incorporate them into the
curtain’s design (like in Chapter 7), buy a fresh box and use only the pins
from the new box, which give your project a more cohesive look. Believe it or
not, not all safety pins are fashioned the same. They may look identical, but
each company adds a slightly different spin.
You may need an array of sizes, so look for 1-inch-long, 2-inch-long, and 3-
inch-long safety pins. They’re cheap, and you can always find a use for them,
even when you’re not sewing.
The larger-size safety pins that some drycleaners use to attach garments to
hangers can be very useful — save them and keep them handy.
Sewing machine needles
Most sewing machines can sew lightweight, silky fabrics for window treatments
and heavy-duty fabrics for slipcovers. The trick is using the right needle.
85
Chapter 5: Getting the Right Tools within Reach

 Regular sewing machine needles: Regular needles are used on light-
weight or mediumweight fabric. Use size 9 or 10 for light fabrics, like voile,
eyelet, crepe, batiste, light charmeuse, or any other lightweight fabrics
listed in Chapter 2. Use size 11 or 12 for mediumweight fabrics like satin,
medium Ultrasuede or other faux suedes, velour, velvet, and the like.
 Heavy-duty sewing machine needles: Quite a few of the projects in this
book call for a heavy-duty needle. Be sure to use heavy-duty needles
(and thread) when you’re sewing heavier fabrics, such as brocades,
heavy denims and ducks, vinyl, canvas, and upholstery fabric. These
needles are usually numbered 14 and 16.
We recommend Singer needles for all your sewing needs, light, medium, and
heavy. In coauthor Mark’s experience, they last the longest and make the
cleanest sewn line, but check the owner’s manual of your sewing machine to
be sure they’re compatible.
When you’re sewing, if your sewing needle skips or makes uneven stitches,
change it. Keep plenty of sewing machine needles on hand, because you
never know when you’ll need a new one.
Measuring up: Essential measuring devices
You’ve probably heard the mantra of contractors and carpenters: “Measure
twice, cut once.” Well, people who sew need to adopt it as their favorite
phrase, too. Measuring your fabric is important, and measuring accurately is
essential. In this section we discuss some of the handy measuring tools you
turn to time and time again.
Cloth tape measures
Cloth tape measures enable you to measure your fabric (and prevent frustra-
tion when determining your fabric’s dimensions), check your measurements
on patterns, and much more. A cloth tape measure also serves well when
you’re measuring a rounded sofa arm or back, because you need the flexibil-
ity to go around those curves.
Most cloth tape measures are 60 inches long, but some notions departments
of fabric and crafts stores stock ones that measures 100 to 120 inches, which
are useful for big projects. If you’re having a hard time finding an extralong
tape measure, though, simply create your own by taping two of the shorter
cloth tapes together.
If your tape measure has seen better days and is starting to curl or doesn’t
stay put, try backing the metric side with some flexible heavy-duty tape. The
backing straightens out the tape measure and gives it some weight, but you’ll
still be able to roll it up. (For all you Francophiles, or international readers,
feel free to cover up the “inches” side.)
86
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

Don’t use metal retractable tape measures for measuring fabric because
they’re unwieldy, they don’t lie flat on the surface of the fabric, and they
don’t do curves well. However, metal tape measures are great for determining
window dimensions.
Sewing grids
A sewing grid is a device that enables you to easily measure your fabric when
it’s spread out on a flat workspace. You can then cut it straight or at right
angles. Being able to cut right angles is especially useful when creating
panels, such as those that require a more precise measurement like casement
curtains with panels that fit over rectangular windows (see Chapter 14).
You can buy sewing grids at any sewing store, or you can customize one
yourself. After all, a sewing grid is just made out of paper.
To make your own sewing grid, follow these easy steps:
1. Lay out and cut some butcher paper so that you’ll have adequate
width and length to cover the area you seek to measure.
Your grid needs to be slightly larger than the largest area you’ll be mea-
suring, say the back of a sofa or an extralong window.
You can pick butcher paper up at any crafts store, where it comes in
sheets or on a roll.
2. Tape the paper down to your sewing table or other flat workspace.
3. Using a marker and a ruler, measure a grid in 5-x-5-inch squares.
Using larger squares helps you make larger patterns for draperies and
slipcovers.
Other great measuring tools
Besides measuring tapes and sewing grids, you also can use the following tools:
 L square (drafting square): An L-square is, as you can imagine, shaped
like the capital letter L, and is used for creating a perfect corner. You
may want to keep an L square around if you decide to make patterns.
Even if you aren’t going to make a pattern, an L-square can help you
keep any line straight and any corner square.
 Seam gauge: This 6-inch ruler with an adjustable slide that moves up
and down its length is very helpful for measuring small and narrow areas
of fabric, such as the long seams and hems typically found in window
treatment panels. This device enables you to verify whether you’ve 
measured evenly, just by sliding the seam gauge along the hem.
 Yardsticks: A wooden, plastic, or metal yardstick (and even shorter
rulers) is great when you need to draw straight lines on fabrics (using
tailor’s chalk, which we discuss in the next section). In fact, we recom-
mend using yardsticks for a few projects in Chapters 14 and 15.
87
Chapter 5: Getting the Right Tools within Reach

Making a mark and chalking it up
Don’t be afraid to draw lines on your fabric! Creating lines on your fabric is
often an essential step in getting a great fit. With the right tools the marks dis-
appear, and only you’ll know your creation once looked a bit like a county
road map.
You also need a good way to mark up your patterns so that every line is clear
and concise. Here’s how:
 Disappearing tailor’s chalk: Also referred to as dressmaker’s chalk, this
tool is essential for marking lines on your fabric. It washes off easily,
leaving no trace. (Chapter 10 has a bit more info on using chalk when
creating slipcovers.)
 Washout pencils and markers: Special marking pencils or pens that are
made for fabric also are helpful when working on light fabrics, and they
also wipe off well. Use them for marking where to sew rings with eyes
directly onto a fabric panel, or where to sew a pleat.
 Colored pencils: Keep two different colored pencils around — one for
drawing your pattern lines on your butcher paper, say black, and
another color, say red, so you can cross out mistakes. That way when
you’re ready to cut, you always know which lines are correct.
If you’re using an unusual piece of fabric (for instance, a piece of vintage
fabric or a fabric from a far-off land, the fiber content of which you’re not
entirely sure about), you may want to test your chalk and/or washout mark-
ing pencil on a corner or scrap piece of the fabric, let it sit a minute, and then
wipe it away. Although tailor’s chalk and marking pencils are made for all fab-
rics, it’s better to be safe than sorry.
Using thimbles
A few projects call for hand tacking (sewing small areas of fabric or trim by
hand), for which you may want to consider picking up a few thimbles, unless
you don’t mind risking your fingertips. Thimbles may look old-fashioned, but
they go a long way toward protecting your fingers when pushing a sharp
needle through fabric.
Thimbles come in plastic and metal and in many sizes. You usually use a
thimble on the middle finger of your dominant hand. Pick one that feels right
to you and keep a few extras on hand (no pun intended). They’re cheap and
useful — the perfect combination!
88
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 

Ripping it out
Sometimes you have to undo what you’ve done, and that’s when a seam
ripper comes in handy. This useful little device removes stitches easily. It has
an upturned sharp end that looks like a little claw, which pulls the stitch up
and away from your fabric, preventing any unwanted cuts or nicks.
When your seam ripper gets dull, throw it out and get a new one at a fabric
store, because they can’t be sharpened. You’ll save money on fabric (and
hours of frustration) when your seam ripper is in top ripping form.
Doing trial-runs with muslin
Muslin is a versatile, off-white, cotton fabric that comes in many different
weights. Best of all, it’s inexpensive so feel free to use it as a test fabric. You
can match the weight of the more expensive fabric you’re using on a given
project with muslin of an equal weight, and then use the latter to practice on.
Whenever you’re trying something new or slightly more challenging — perhaps
a project from Chapter 17 — that you believe your skill level may not match, or
you’re unsure whether your fabric calculation or measurements are correct,
you may want to try it out in muslin first. After getting the pattern right with
the muslin, you’ll feel more confident in your skills and won’t end up wasting
the real fabric. You can even keep the completed muslin version as a “pattern”
to use to make future slipcovers. Check out more on muslin in Chapter 10.
Ironing out the details
“Press as you go” is something you’ll hear in roundtable discussions at sewing
classes, and with good reason. Ironing your seams after you sew them is an
essential step. You need a good-quality iron, preferably one that makes steam.
Steam is helpful when you want to seal your curtain pleats in place, for exam-
ple, or when you’re working with heavy-duty upholstery fabrics.
Make sure that your ironing board is at least standard size, or long enough to
accommodate the fabric lengths of swags, other draperies, and slipcovers.
(Those little mini-boards sure are cute and convenient, but save them for
pressing your unmentionables.)
You also want to have a good press cloth in case your fabric is wrinkled from
pretreating or from off-the-bolt wrinkles. See Chapter 3 for more on choosing
a press cloth.
89
Chapter 5: Getting the Right Tools within Reach

If you intend to use Stitch Witchery, or any kind of adhesive-backed decoration,
keep an iron-cleaning solution around. (To find out more about Stitch Witchery,
check out “Stuck on you: Using bonding tape” later in this chapter.) If you acci-
dentally iron over the adhesive, it can stick to your iron. Trust us, you don’t
want to gum up the plate of your iron and then transfer that substance onto
another piece of fabric (or a loved one’s favorite shirt) when your iron gets hot.
It pays to have a reliable cleaning solution around for when you may need it.
Zeroing In on Special Accessories
This section provides a few extra items to keep nearby. You’re sure to use
them at one time or another.
Stuck on you: Using bonding tape
For creating light window treatments that are more decorative than func-
tional, we’re fans of iron-on bonding tapes (like Stitch Witchery). These
sewing-substitute adhesive tapes come in a roll. The tape is like iron-on glue
that is activated by an iron’s heat and is available at any crafts or sewing
store. It comes in many widths, so match your bonding tape to its task.
Choose 1-inch tape for hems and wider types for attaching appliqués, such as
decorative bows and flowers, without pulling out the thread and needle to
sew. You can also use it for attaching most trims.
Sorry, we can’t recommend iron-on bonding tape to substitute for “real”
sewing, like creating pleats in curtains. Nor can we vouch for its use in creat-
ing slipcovers! It just isn’t tough enough to hold seams together that need to
stand up to the rigors of the human body.
90
Part I: Window Treatments & Slipcovers 101 
Saving time with a serger
A serger is a machine separate from your sewing
machine that specializes in cutting and finishing
the edges of fabric in one easy step. It makes pre-
cision cuts and then overcasts the cut edge with
thread, so your fabric doesn’t unravel. Although
sergers are used mostly to finish knitted fabric,
you can use a serger on many types of fabric. A
serger is a great timesaver when you’re making a
project with many finished seams and hems.
Sergers can go from $350 to $500 new, but you
can pick them up used for far less. If you sew fre-
quently, a serger is a good investment.
You need to stock up on thread, because a
serger can use from three to six spools of
thread at a time, compared to a sewing machine
that uses only one spool on the same project.

If you use iron-on bonding tape, make sure that you hand wash your creation.
Sewing tape isn’t as sturdy or long lasting as real sewing. If you find the hem
is coming undone after laundering, simply reiron it or reapply some more
bonding tape in the places that are starting to give.
Staying fray-free with sealant
Whenever we’re working with fabric that becomes frayed, we use a product
called Fray Check. You can pick it up at any crafts or sewing store. Fray Check
is a sealant applied the same way as glue; it dries clear and stops fabrics from
fraying (see our discussion about using lace in Chapter 7).
Unfortunately, Fray Check isn’t perfect. It can wash out even with light
repeated laundering, causing the fabric to become even more susceptible to
fraying. Be proactive and keep the bottle after you’ve completed the project,
in case you need to apply more.
Fray Check is best used in small applications, for example, to mend a snipped
edge of fabric or a corner of fraying material, but not along an entire seam.
You may want to consider finishing highly fraying fabric with a serger (see
the sidebar “Saving time with a serger” earlier in this chapter).
Having glue gun fun
A glue gun, an electricity-powered hand-held device that delivers hot glue in a
thin stream, can be your best friend in a tight spot. Hot glue seals fabric
together in the same way that needle and thread do. It’s durable enough for
many window treatment projects, and for adding trim to both window treat-
ments and some slipcovers.
You can pick up a glue gun at any crafts store or hardware store. Remember
you get what you pay for so buy the best one you can afford: Better quality
glue guns tend to be larger, so make sure it’s comfortable in your hand before
you buy it. Unfortunately, the cute, cheap mini-glue guns don’t last as long
and tend to leak glue a bit more than others. We talk a more about how to use
hot glue in Chapter 8.
Adding a zipper foot to
your sewing machine
A zipper foot is a sewing machine attachment that helps you sew in zippers.
They’re narrower than other types of sewing feet, so you can get closer to the
zipper’s teeth. A zipper foot has one toe (the part that helps guide and hold the
91
Chapter 5: Getting the Right Tools within Reach

fabric down) shaped like a flat little trowel. The zipper foot attachment comes
standard with most sewing machines. If you don’t like the plastic one that came
with your machine, buy a zipper foot made of metal that fits on your machine.
(You can buy them at any sewing store for around $20.) The added weight of a
metal foot holds the fabric in place better, making sewing much easier.
For fabrics with rubber or plastic backings (such as vinyl, or for certain types
of fabric used for weatherproofed curtain linings), you may want to locate a
Teflon zipper foot. It has a Teflon layer adhered to the bottom that enables
the fabric to glide smoothly over the feeder (which is that little part with
teeth that pulls the fabric along).

Sewing machines: The old and new of it
Whether you use an old workhorse that was
handed down from your mother (or grandmother)
or you like the modern conveniences of a new
sewing machine is really a matter of taste.
Older machines: If you’ve been using the same
older-model machine for years and don’t want to
upgrade, we understand completely. Like a comfy
old sweater that has seen better days, you’re
used to the feel of your sewing machine and don’t
want to replace it. And if your machine works
well, why should you, right? The biggest problem
with older sewing machines, however, and some-
thing for you who are considering buying a used
machine need to know, is that most don’t have a
reverse. Being able to reverse the stitching
makes sewing much easier, because as you can
tack the ends of your seams, it keeps them in
place without a hassle. All newer machines have
a reverse mode. The upside of older sewing
machines is that they have much more power
than newer ones. So choosing between new and
old can be a bit of a trade-off; only you can decide
what’s more important. The Kenmore, Singer,
Viking, or Sears brands have endured through the
years. Look for older machines at yard sales, flea
markets, and thrift shops, where you can find a
great older machine for as little as $20!
When considering a used sewing machine,
make sure that the belt is in good condition and
that it can be replaced easily. Sometimes find-
ing replacement parts for older machines is dif-
ficult. Making sure that the machine’s timing is
set and running well also is important. Lousy
timing is the coup de grace for a sewing
machine. Just like with a used car, you need to
take your potential sewing machine for a test
run. Bring your own fabric, load in your own
thread, plug it in, sit down, and check out all its
parts, from top to bottom, before buying.
Newer machines: New machines have some
really fantastic, fun sewing features that are very
seductive to sewing aficionados. Most have
embroidery capabilities for embellishing your
creations and new decorative stitch styles, such
as scalloping, diamonds, and checkerboards.
They also have stretch-stitch capabilities, which
is a way to stitch knitted fabric so that the thread
doesn’t pop or break when the fabric stretches.
Newer machines can create buttonholes, too. As
tempting as all these items are, they’re not nec-
essary to sew in a basic and easy way. You only
need a straight-stitching machine to create the
projects we offer in this book, but the little extra
features a new machine provides are fun to
have, especially if you want to use contrasting
thread color for visual interest.

M
aking window treatments that give your windows that “just right” pro-
fessional look may seem like a big challenge. You may feel a bit over-
whelmed. How can you possibly remember every consideration before you
begin to sew? We know that making window treatments may feel like an intri-
cate puzzle that needs solving. Take a deep breath though. In this chapter
we help with one of the big puzzle pieces — correctly measuring your fabric,
making the pattern, and cutting your fabric.
Each window treatment project in this book has specific measuring advice at
its start. However, before you delve into those individual projects, this chapter
gives you some helpful basic information about measuring. In this chapter,
we show you everything you need to know, from assembling your tool kit, to
figuring out a window’s anatomy, to grasping the ins and outs of hands-on
measuring, to making your own patterns, and finally to cutting your fabric
properly.

Considering Form and Function
“Form and function” is a phrase thrown around a lot in the design world, but
its meaning is pretty simple. Form is the way the treatment and the window
underneath look; function is how the treatment helps the window do its job, or
modifies the window’s job. To get the most out of your windows, always keep
in mind how they work and how they look while you’re planning a winning
treatment. The way you cover your window affects the way they function.
Measuring affords you the benefit of taking a close, long look at your windows’
form and their components. To consider your windows’ form, take down your
old treatment, get up on the ladder, and take a gander at your windows,
their trim molds, and frames. Are they made of beautiful wood that you want
to show off and incorporate into your window design? You may want to keep
the sill free of extra fabric, if you use your sills for display purposes, or if a
beloved family pet frequently perches there. Or are your frames and sills less
than perfect and you want to cover them up completely? Maybe your window
frames are just a neutral space that you can cover or uncover.
When looking at function, consider whether your window’s depth allows for
an inside-mount window treatment. Do you have a window that opens in an
inward fashion? Are there cranks or other operating devices that will get in
the way of certain types of treatments? These details can help you determine
what kind of treatment you need. Also, understanding how much coverage
you need influences how you measure for fullness.
Keep in mind that it may be necessary to measure each individual window.
Don’t assume that a bank of three windows all contain identical measurements:
One may be a half-inch or a full inch wider or narrower. For example, what if
you’re creating a treatment that perches on the inside of your window frame?
(If you have decorative trims, such as the beveled wood ones found in older
homes, you may decide on a treatment that shows them off, and your treat-
ment may only be as wide as the outside of your window frame.) Even an
extra inch can make a difference.
Determining the measurements of your finished treatment is just as impor-
tant as having your window dimensions on hand. For example, your window
may measure 30 x 80 inches, but you intend to mount your rod 4 inches
above your window frame, and you also want your curtains to extend 3
inches on each side of your window frame. To keep all this information
straight, add the information into your color notebook (where you keep your
swatches and other info to help you visualize your creation; see Chapter 2)
under the title “treatment dimensions.”
Keeping your color notebook handy with its detailed notes can help you
when you’re shopping to “imagine” the finished piece before you sew it, and
also in buying the correct amount of fabric. Being ready with the right infor-
mation also can help you obtain good advice from salespeople.

Lining Up Your Measuring Tools
Having the right tools is essential. In Chapter 5, we give you a list of general
tools to create the projects in this book. This section focuses on the tools
you need to measure your windows properly and plan your treatments.
The following list includes the measuring tools you need to have on hand:
 A flexible/cloth tape measure: Use it for measuring fabric for swags
(see Chapter 5 for more on this useful tool).
 Pen and notebook or paper: Use these tools to record the measure-
ments (see Chapter 2 for the importance of keeping a notebook).
 Steel measuring tape (the retractable type that curls up inside a box):
Use it for measuring your window from top to bottom, left to right.
Before you start measuring your window and getting the pattern ready for
your dynamite window treatments, we need to cover a few definitions we use
throughout the book. Okay, you probably know what “width” means, but we
want to make sure everyone is on the same page concerning the following
terms:
 Circumference: The measurement around the perimeter of a circle or
half circle (as on an arched or round window pane)
 Diameter: The measurement across the center of a circle (as across a
round window, or across a curtain ring)
 Length: The vertical measurement from top to bottom (as up and down
on a window)
 Width: The horizontal measurement from left to right (as across a
window)
Also note that when we refer to curtains, we’re using the generic term for
“window treatment.” You could make most of the projects in this book that
we call curtains as draperies; usually all you have to do is extend their length
(see “Measuring your windows for length” in this chapter for more info).
Acquainting Yourself with Your Windows
Just like people, windows come in all shapes and sizes. Some of them
are easy to treat, some of them more of a challenge. Although we use 
30- x 60-inch double-hung–type windows as the template for the projects
in Chapters 7, 14, and 15 (for two reasons: it’s a very common window size,
and they’re the size of the windows in Mark’s New York City apartment), you
need to remember that there is no such thing as a standard-size window.
97
Chapter 6: Measuring, Making Patterns, and Cutting Fabric for Your Windows

In this section we look at the different types of windows you may encounter
and then delve further into your windows to discover their different parts.
Identifying different types of windows
Before you start to measure your windows, you need to know what type of
windows you have. This section addresses the most common type of rectan-
gular windows as well as the most challenging types.
First, the most common:
 Casement windows: These windows have two vertical panes hinged at
the sides that open inward or outward from the middle of the window
with the help of handles at the bottom.
 Double-hung windows: These windows feature two horizontal panels,
one of which slides up with the help of a sash to allow fresh air to enter
through the bottom section.
 Jalousie windows: These windows open outward in three or four hori-
zontal sections with the use of a crank.
Meanwhile, these windows may be the most challenging to treat:
 Arched windows: Windows whose tops are shaped like an arch, either
alone or above another type of window.
 Bay windows: A bank of three flush double-hung windows similar to a
Palladian window, but the panes are set at an angle and curve outward
to create an alcove, or bay.
 Cathedral windows: A bank of windows, one of which is a stationary
pane topped by a triangular or trapezoidal window, and flanked on
either side by double-hung or casement windows.
 Dormer windows: These windows are recessed, usually by sloped ceil-
ings on either side, as in attics.
 Palladian windows: A bank of three windows with an arch over the
center window, or a similar variation.
 Picture window: This wide window has one large pane in the middle
that doesn’t open, flanked by two slimmer panels that are basically mini-
double-hung windows or mini-casement windows.
 Other odd-shaped windows: They include everything from ovals, trian-
gles, trapezoids, diamonds, very long and skinny windows, and very
wide and short windows, some of which are stationary and decorative,
and some of which open like double-hung windows.

Dissecting a window
Don’t worry, this section isn’t nearly as tough as biology class, but you do
need to know a bit of anatomy so you can measure correctly. Following are
the basic parts of a window:
 Apron: The piece of decorative wood underneath the windowsill. If the
window doesn’t have a windowsill, the apron looks like a continuation of
the trim mold.
 Frame: Sometimes referred to as the casing, it’s the inner, functional
(mechanical) border of the window, usually made of metal.
 Trim mold: The area that trims the outside of the window frame, decora-
tive in nature and usually made of wood. The trim mold lines the top,
left, and right sides of the window frame.
 Windowsill: The area just below the bottom trim mold, which extends
out to create a miniature shelf under the window.

Chapter 6: Measuring, Making Patterns, and Cutting Fabric for Your Windows

Consider taking a digital photo of your undressed window, enlarging it,
and printing out a few copies. Label all the elements of your window using
Figure 6-1 as a guide, noting how the window opens. You can then sketch
over the photo, using it as a template for designing your window treatment.
Looking Closer at a Window’s
Measurements
You basically can choose from two types of window measurements: those for
an outside mount (treatments whose width and length measurements extend
past the window frames), and those for an inside mount(treatments whose
width measurements remain inside the frames and whose length measure-
ments usually extend to the top of the sill). We distinguish them in the follow-
ing list:
 Window width, for inside mount: The distance between one side of the
window to the other, measured from the outer edge of the frame to the
other outer edge of the frame.
 Window width, for outside mount: The distance from the outside edge
of the trim mold to the other. Adding inches to account for returns on
either side increases the width measurement.
 Window length, for inside mount: The distance between the top of the
window frame to the windowsill.
 Window length, for outside mount: The distance from the outside edge
of the trim mold to the bottom of the window’s apron.
 Left and right returns: The returns are the areas on either side of a flat
rod that extend out so the treatment sticks out and away from the
window. You may need to add a left or right return measurement when
using flat rods that extend many inches out from the window.
 Above and below the window: Above is the distance from the top of the
trim mold to the ceiling, and below is the area between the edges of the
windowsill to the floor.
Getting the Gist of Measuring
Measuring your windows to figure out the finished width and length is
simple. Keep the information in this section in mind before you begin measur-
ing your windows.

Mounting your rod first 
for better measuring
After you decide on your style but before you begin to measure your window
to decide how much fabric you need, mount your rod or pole. Or for outside-
mount shade projects, mark the spot where you plan to place your mounting
board (see the shade projects in Chapter 15 to read all about mounting
boards). Having your hardware in place makes everything easier. You have a
definite focal point and measuring aid in place. Check out Chapter 4 to help
you decide how and where to install your hardware.
Also, for draping projects, likes draped swags (see Chapter 7), you need a rod
or pole in place to test this treatment style and get the feel of how to drape
fabric well. Mount your rod or pole and throw a silky type fabric you have at
home over it to approximate what your treatment will look like. If you have a
hard time visualizing whether a swag will fit your room, you can practice cre-
ating swags to see if it’s a style you really like.
As you decide where to mount your hardware, keep these questions in mind:
 How much light do you want to block out? The more coverage you
have on either side of your window, and above and below it, will obvi-
ously block more light; mount your rod accordingly.
 How much privacy do you want the treatment to give? Your fabric
choice plays a big factor with privacy, but your hardware placement also
plays a role. The more fabric coverage and the more your hardware
extends on either side of your window, the more privacy you have.
 How keen are you on creating the illusion of window height? A rod
mounted 6 inches above your window frame makes your windows
appear longer and changes the room’s proportion. You can even mount
your rod on the ceiling for some treatments. See Chapter 4, as well as
Chapters 8 and 9, for more illusion-creating tips.
Measuring your windows for width,
using outside-mount measuring
Measuring your windows for curtains and draperies that hang outside the
window molding is easy. Just decide how much coverage you want and
mount your rod. Measure your rod from end to end. If you’re using a flat rod
that sticks out from the window more than an inch or so, take into account
the return areas on the left and right sides.
101
Chapter 6: Measuring, Making Patterns, and Cutting Fabric for Your Windows

Your width measurement also needs to consider the hem allowance for
either side of each panel you’re creating. Hem allowance is the allotted fabric
needed to create a hem. It’s usually double; for a 1⁄2-inch seam, allow a 
1-inch measure. (We talk about specific seam allowance amounts in each
project.)
Measuring your windows for width,
using inside-mount measuring
Some treatments fit inside the window frame. For shades, measure from
frame to frame. Not all windows are plumb, so take the width measurement in
two or three places. Working with the smallest width figure, round up to the
nearest quarter inch.
Determining cut panel width
To figure out the cut width of a flat-panel curtain or drapery (ones that
aren’t gathered at the top, such as pleated curtains), measure the window
width and add 2 inches (one inch to each side) to allow for finishing the
side hems. 
For gathered curtains, add anywhere from 11⁄2 to 2 times the width so that it
has adequate fullness. Add seam allowance if you need more than one width
of fabric for each panel.
For a lined flat panel, only add a half-inch on each side for finishing the sides.
You don’t need much extra fabric because it tucks inside.
When working with sheer fabrics, double the width measurement of each
panel for adequate fullness. For heavier fabrics, use only 11⁄2 times the fabric.
Don’t forget to add in your half-inch seam allowance!
Measuring your windows for length
When measuring your window for length, you need to keep two factors in
mind: where you want your treatment to begin and end and the type of treat-
ment you’re making.
The following information on treatment types can help when you’re measur-
ing for length.
102
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 

 Generally, curtains are treatments that extend from the top of the rod or
pole to the top of the sill. Measure your length accordingly.
 Draperies are treatments that extend from the rod to any area below the
sill (the beginning of the apron), usually to midapron and to the floor.
For draperies, measure from the top of the rod to the midapron, or to a
1⁄2-inch above the floor, depending on the style you seek. To create pud-
dles, add an extra 6 or 8 inches. Remember that draperies can be almost
any length, so you need to decide how long you want them.
Keep in mind the opening mechanism of the window when deciding on
treatment length. If your window opens inward, a treatment that extends
past the sill may be difficult to manage.
 For the London and Roman shade projects in this book in Chapter 15,
measure from the top of the mounting board, which goes above the
window frame, to the top of the windowsill.
 For treating eaves and doorways, measure from the top of the rod (usu-
ally a tension rod that sits within an inch of the top of the doorway) to a
1⁄2-inch above the floor.
Determining cut panel length
To figure out a treatment’s cut length, take the measured panel length and
add an additional amount for the rod sleeve (the sleeve where the rod goes),
if your treatment has one. If not, you need to account for the length of your
curtain rings, and also add the correct amount for the bottom hem. Check
out the next section for adding rod sleeves or curtain rings.
Adding a rod sleeves or curtain rings
To determine your rod sleeve’s measurement, measure your rod’s circumfer-
ence and add 1 inch or 11⁄2 inches; this extra ease allows fabric to hang prop-
erly and move across your rod easily.
The thicker your rod or pole, the more generous you need to be with your
rod sleeve circumference. Also keep in mind the backing (underside) texture
of your fabric type. Is it a napped or “sticky” type of fabric that doesn’t slide
easily; is it a silky or sheer fabric that does?
When planning your rod sleeve or curtain rings, keep these general guide-
lines in mind:
 For a tension rod, add 21⁄2 to 31⁄2 inches to your rod circumference.
 For a decorative pole, which is usually thicker, add 31⁄2 to 41⁄2 inches to
your rod circumference.
 For small, thin rods that are used to hang more delicate curtains, such as
casement rods or cafe curtain rods, add 11⁄2 to 2 inches for your rod sleeve.
103
Chapter 6: Measuring, Making Patterns, and Cutting Fabric for Your Windows

 For a treatment that uses curtain rings with clips, the general rule is to
subtract 11⁄2 inches for them (because it doesn’t have a rod sleeve). If
you’re using outsized or custom-made rings, measure them and subtract
the inches they’ll take up. For a curtain ring that you sew on, subtract
the clip’s total diameter measurement from your length measurement.
For a ring clip that you clip on, measure the length from one end of the
clip’s pincher to the top of the ring or decorative area that covers
the ring.
Bottom hems
The hem at the bottom of a window treatment panel not only finishes the
treatment, but it also adds weight so the curtains hang well. How big a hem
you need depends on the type of fabric you use and its weight. The range is
usually 3 to 6 inches. Heavier or thicker fabrics call for a smaller hem. A
window treatment panel’s hem not only finishes the treatment, but it also
adds weight so the curtains hang well.
For sheer curtains, consider adding an extra few inches of hem fabric to add
a bit of weight. If you don’t like the look of a big hem (one that extends up
very far on the curtain or drapery), you can double or even triple the fabric
over and tuck it in to create a smaller hem.
If you plan to use a double treatment — hanging one set of draperies
behind another set of draperies (for instance, sheers behind opaque fabric
draperies) — make the inside treatment’s hem a half-inch shorter than the
other one, so it doesn’t peak out underneath the outside treatment.
Adding length for balloon treatments
Traditionally total balloon length of a valance needs to total one-quarter of
your total window length. We don’t necessarily agree with that caveat. If you
want your valance to be a bit longer for some added protection from the late-
day sun, go right ahead! Balloon valance length measurements do need a bit
of extra fabric to create fullness and a billowy look. Just add 8 inches to the
finished valance measurement to get this fullness.
Balloon shade length measurements need an additional 10 inches to the fin-
ished length of your curtain for the appropriate billowy look. For more on
balloon-type treatments, see Chapter 14.
Accounting for puddles
To create a puddle effect, pick out a light- to mediumweight fabric. Heavy fab-
rics don’t create a puddle well because they’re usually too tough and stiff. To
determine the puddle look you want, first use a cotton sheet to test the effect
before shopping for your fabric. Some people like a deep puddle with plenty
of fabric on the floor, while others just want a ripple or two touching the floor.
104
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 

To test what you like, puddle a yard of your fabric into shape, and then mea-
sure it to see how much extra length you need. Generally, you need to add
6 to 8 inches past the floor to your panel length, but you could add up to a
foot if you want a special puddle effect.
Measuring for swags
The key to measuring fabric length for a swag or a swag and cascade is using
a flexible tape measure for your swag measurement. Because the swag curves
down away from the rod in an arc, you need a measuring device, such as a
cloth tape measure, that arcs and curves, too. For more on the swag-and-
cascade treatment, check out Chapter 14.
To measure for a swag, follow these easy steps:
1. Starting from the left-hand side of your window (at the floor, or at what-
ever spot to which your cascade will hang), measure up to the rod.
This is your left-hand cascade measurement.
2. Next, starting from the top of the pole on the left-hand side, take your
flexible measuring tape and re-create the arc of the swag over to the
top right-hand side of the pole.
This is your swag measurement. You need to measure the lowest part of
the draped swag in order to get the appropriate amount of fabric.
3. Measure your right-hand cascade by measuring from the rod to the
end (at the floor, or at whatever spot to which your cascade will hang).
This is your right-hand cascade measurement.
4. Add these three measurements together.
Make sure to include a bit of extra fabric to account for any swirling
around the rod on either side, plus 1 to 11⁄2 inches on either side for the
side hems.
Making and Using Patterns
Some of the projects in this book call for creating patterns. Before you start
to make (and use) your patterns, you need to have the right tools. Keep the
following tools together in one box or basket, so you always know where
they are.
 Flexible cloth measuring tape
 L-square (also called a drafting square)
 Pattern paper or butcher’s paper
105
Chapter 6: Measuring, Making Patterns, and Cutting Fabric for Your Windows

 Scissors/shears
 Fabric marker or tailor’s chalk (optional)
(See Chapter 5 for specific information about these tools.)
Creating patterns for window treatments
The advantage to making patterns is that you can easily create many panels
that will be identical to each other. You can also easily replicate a treatment in
many different fabrics as many times as you want, whether for identical win-
dows in the same room, or for future window treatments. Patterns are worth
the time and effort if you like to change the look of your windows frequently.
Most patterns for window treatments are big squares or rectangles, for
making basic panels, or small rectangles, for creating tabs and tiebacks.
However, if your project has any pleats or folds (such as pleated draperies),
or parts with curved edges (such as ruffle curtains), you may want to make a
pattern for them to keep them consistent and your creation on track.
You can make patterns using plain butcher’s paper (plain, thin off-white paper
that comes on a roll or in a package), or you can buy specially made pattern
paper, which has a dot every inch, to help you measure inch by inch and keep
lines straight. For more on making a grid with butcher’s paper, see Chapter 5.
To begin making your pattern, follow these easy steps:
1. Lay out your paper on your workspace, and using the left-hand edge
as your guide, measure out the pattern dimensions you need.
To create perfect corners, use your L-square.
The little lines of dots that run across pattern paper at the inch markers
can help you keep a straight line and to make nice 90-degree angles.
2. For arched or curved patterns (for example, in the arched valance or
ruffle curtains projects), draw your curves freehand.
For an arch, start in the center and draw your arch from side to side, or
fold your pattern paper in half and cut it to make each side even.
You’re just working with paper. Feel free to mess up and try again, to
tape additional paper on if you need it, and even to practice something
like cutouts before you begin on fabric. In the end experimenting on
paper first can save you time and money.
3. When you’re ready to cut your paper pattern, use a sharp pair of scis-
sors (not your dressmaker’s sheers, which are reserved for cutting
fabric only) and cut exactly along the drawn line.

Pattern placement tips
Placing your pattern properly is an important step in making your panel
come out right. Keep the following information in mind when laying out your
pattern on the fabric:
 Pretreating and ironing your fabric before cutting or placing your pat-
tern are vital steps. If you choose a washable fabric, you need to pre-
treat it. Furthermore, you need to make sure all the wrinkles and creases
are ironed out. If the fabric still has wrinkles, it won’t lie flat when you
cut it or when you’re placing your pattern. (See Chapter 3 for more
important pointers about pretreating your fabric.)
 Laying the pattern on-grain (parallel to the selvage edges) is essential.
Be sure to double-check that your pattern’s grain line is parallel with the
selvages before you cut your fabric. See the sidebar “Is your fabric on-
grain?” in this chapter for more info.
 Pinning your pattern in place helps when it’s time to cut. Use a
straight pin every 6 inches, making sure that your pin is on the inside of
the pattern (rather than on the pattern edge or sticking out of the edge),
so that when you’re cutting you don’t cut down on a pin and ruin your
shears.
The following sections offer some additional tips about working with fabrics
that have certain textures and prints.
Knowing the parts of your fabric
If you understand the parts of a piece of fabric, you’ll be able to place your
pattern correctly and cut it properly. The following list dissects a piece of
fabric into its important parts that you need to know:
 Bias: An imaginary line that runs 45 degrees between the lengthwise and
crosswise grains. To find the bias without a measuring device, fold the
fabric diagonally so that the cut end aligns with one selvage.
 Crosswise grain: The grain that runs across the fabric’s width. You can
always find this edge by seeking out the selvage edges; the width is
always perpendicular.
 Lengthwise grain: The grain that runs along the fabric’s length. You can
always find this grain line by seeking out the selvage edges; the length is
always parallel.
 Selvages: The finished edges of the fabric, usually marked with color
codes or numbers. The selvages (or selvage edges) always run parallel
to the lengthwise grain.
Figure 6-2 can help you identify these parts.
107
Chapter 6: Measuring, Making Patterns, and Cutting Fabric for Your Windows

Working with textures
When you’re working with a fabric with a nap (a soft or fuzzy, raised texture),
such as velvet, velveteen, or corduroy, make sure that all your fabric is facing
the correct way when you place your pattern on it. Run your hand along the
fabric’s length to ensure the nap for each piece of fabric feels smooth from
top to bottom. If it’s rough or your hand meets resistance, you have the nap
the wrong way.

Is your fabric on-grain?
On-grain means that your pattern repeats coin-
cide exactly with the fabric’s crosswise grain.
Knowing if your fabric is on-grain is important
if you want your fabric to hang straight and to
avoid a left-or-right-skewing panel that makes
you feel dizzy. Verify if the grain runs correctly
by placing your fabric on a flat surface and fold-
ing back the crosswise edge so that you align
the selvages on the sides. Then make a fold to
create a crease, and unfold the fabric. Does the
crease run into the selvages at exactly the same
place in the pattern on both sides? If it does,
your fabric is on-grain; if not, save the fabric for
a project where you don’t have to do any pat-
tern matching.

Working with prints
If your fabric has a small-scale, allover print, you don’t have to worry too
much about matching the design from panel to panel. They’ll “blend”
together if your print is petite. However, if you’ve chosen a print with a one-
way design, that is, a print that only looks right going one way, for instance, a
red rose with a stem, you also need to make sure that all your panels run the
same way, so that the rose is pointing up, not down. The same goes with
using horizontal stripes or plaids.
When you’re working with medium- or large-scale motifs on printed fabric
that need to match from panel to panel, take the pattern repeats into consid-
eration. (For a discussion on decorating with scale in mind, see Chapter 1.)
Here’s a simple way to match patterns:
1. Place two widths of fabric so that their right sides touch, aligning the
selvages.
Fold back the selvage on the top piece of fabric and adjust the fabric so
that the patterns are matching.
2. Using an iron, press back the folded selvage along the fold line.
3. Unfold the selvage so it’s flat again and pin the two pieces of fabric
together along the pressed line, so that the pins cross over the line.
4. Gently turn the two attached pieces of fabric over to confirm that the
patterns are matching.
5. Stitch the seam, removing pins as you go.
Don’t sew over the pins!
6. Cut away the selvage edges on both pieces of fabric so that you have a
1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
For medium or large prints, be sure that your pattern repeats are consistent.
Place your pattern at the same point on the print each time. For example, if
you place the pattern for one panel 1 inch above the top of the red rose,
make sure you do the same for each subsequent panels. (For even more infor-
mation about sewing with prints and patterns, see Sewing For Dummies, 2nd
Edition, by Jan Saunders Maresh [Wiley].)
Cutting Your Fabric
After you know your measurements, have placed your pattern correctly, and
secured it with pins, you can cut the length and width of the fabric to create
your window treatment’s panels.
109
Chapter 6: Measuring, Making Patterns, and Cutting Fabric for Your Windows

When you lay out your fabric on your workspace, make sure you have plenty
of room to work and that your shears are in good shape. We don’t recom-
mend working on a bed, because the cutting angle isn’t good. You want to be
at the same level as your fabric so you can cut it straight. If you must work on
the bed (or on the floor), consider investing in a good-quality fold-up cutting
board, which you can buy at most crafts or fabric stores. It can protect your
bed linens and provide a nice, flat surface for cutting.
When you start to cut, place a weight in the center of the pattern and fabric,
if you need help keeping your fabric in one place. If you don’t have a sewing
weight, try a book, or several books.
If you have fabric that ravels, it may benefit from pinking (being cut with pink-
ing shears). If so, use your pinking shears after you’ve cut out your pattern
piece or pieces using your regular shears. Pinking shears don’t give an accu-
rate line and make your sewing job harder if you cut your pattern with them.
Always cut as close to the pattern’s edges without cutting the paper.
Keep these tips in mind, and you’ll get great results every time:
 Place your pattern on the right side (that is, the pretty face side) of the
fabric.
 Make sure your fabric edges are straight. Align your L-square along the
selvage (vertical) edge and with your marking pen, make a line along
the perpendicular (horizontal) side. Cut along the line and you have
straight edges.
For solid fabrics, be sure all cuts are made along the exact crosswise
grain of the fabric. For printed fabrics that require pattern matching,
check to ensure that your fabric is on-grain before you begin.
 Be sure your fabric’s nap is going the same way each time you cut a
pattern.
 Be sure your printed fabric is going the same way each time you cut and
that you’ve placed your pattern on the same spot each time, following
the pattern repeat.
 Pin your fabric in place every few inches, with either straight pins, or
safety pins, for more hold (see Chapter 5 for more on pins).
 Cut your fabric evenly and without cutting the paper.
Now your fabric is measured and cut and you’re ready to sew! See Chapter 7
or even 14 for some easy projects to get started.

S
o you don’t sew and don’t want to figure out how, eh? That’s okay. Who
says you have to operate a sewing machine to add a bit of panache to
your window frames? Not us. Quick, easy-to-make window treatments are the
name of the game when Mark designs rooms on the TLC television program,
While You Were Out. Just because something packs tons of style doesn’t mean
it has to be difficult to make.
In this chapter, we show you how to make easy no-sew and low-sew window
treatments. What do you require to make all these projects? No need to buy a
sewing machine. All you need are a good pair of shears, some great fabric, a
needle and thread, a glue gun, some useful accessories, and just a little bit of
imagination.
Skip Sewing: What Rings, Pins,
and a Little Glue Can Do
One of the best things about window treatments that don’t require any, or
very little, sewing — we call ’em low-sew draperies and curtains — is you

can frequently change them because they’re so quick, easy, and inexpensive
to make. For example, are you tired of those red velvet swags hanging in
your living room? No problem! Pull them down in two minutes and replace
them with a pastel-striped valance and a set of sheer curtains. When you’ve
only invested a few hours and a few bucks in window treatments, you won’t
feel so married to them, and that freedom can liberate your designing
impulses.
A few of these projects do require very minimal sewing. In that case, you can
sew them by hand. If you’re a needlephobe, don’t even bother with the
needle and thread. Instead you can just glue your project together with a hot
glue gun. Clips and clip rings, mini-clip rings, and safety pins (more on this
topic in the “Safety pins” section below, and also check out Chapter 5 for
more discussion) make quick changes easy, and you don’t even have to sew a
rod sleeve (that little pocket of fabric at the top of a treatment where you
push the rod through).
Rings with clips
Rings with clips are an amazingly chic and ultra-easy way to hang curtains,
draperies, and valances without all the fuss of sewing. They slip right over a
rod and slide back and forth easily, attaching to your fabric with small clips
that hang off the rings. These small to medium-size clips resemble the ones
that children use to attach their mittens to their coat sleeves. Mini-clip rings
are an even smaller version, appropriate for lightweight fabric treatments.
If you decide to use rings with clips, you need to match the strength and
size of them to your fabric weight. Metal and wood rings are sturdier than
plastic ones. You may also want to check out the tension of the clip and
how much fabric you can sandwich in before purchasing. A mini-clip that
can handle lace or eyelet may look adorable, but may not be able to handle
a heavier-type fabric.
Clips are great to use when hanging curtains, draperies, and valences
because they’re so adaptable. If you get bored with one style, you only need
a few bucks and a little time to change them. Furthermore, cleaning the
fabric is a breeze. Separating the clips from the fabric is easy when you’re
ready to launder or make a seasonal window treatment change.
Make an effort to find curtain clips that complement your decor as well as
the curtain or drapery. If your furniture finials or pulls are chrome, try to
keep your clips and rings in the silver family. If the treatment fabric you
choose is a modern one, look for a clean, unencumbered clip and ring style.
(Check out Chapter 20 for great sources for clips.)

Safety pins
If all you want to do is make a rod sleeve at the top of your fabric so you can
slide a curtain rod through it, medium to large safety pins are another way to
avoid sewing. You only have to measure your fabric evenly across the top
width, fold the top of the fabric down, pin it across the “line” where you
would normally sew (see Figure 7-1), and slide your rod through. Be sure to
attach the safety pins to the back of the treatment so they don’t show. (This
treatment is perfect for a beach or country house, when hauling a sewing
machine up a mountain or over a causeway isn’t convenient!)
Hot glue
Hot glue from a glue gun is great for adhering fabric to fabric. It sounds cheap
and awful — ugh, gunky glue under a cute curtain fabric! — but the fact
remains that hot glue and fabric are a match made in heaven. Because fabric
is so porous, the glue bonds perfectly, and if you’re really careful with your
application (not too much, not too little, look out for bumps), and you
restrict the use of hot glue to underside areas that people can’t see, you can
create a great hem or a smooth rod sleeve in a jiffy. And unless you have a
particularly nosy significant other, friend, or in-law, nobody will ever know.
Draping Windows: Easy-To-Create Looks
A swag is a purely decorative window-top treatment that features flowing
or silky-looking fabric. The traditional swag shape is a scallop (a curved orna-
mental edge resembling a rounded shell), but the scarf swag look is a less
formal window-top treatment. You can make it from one length of fabric, and
it’s usually kept in place with a simple decorative rod or special swag holders.

Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

The big challenge with creating swags is getting your drapery right. Don’t
worry. We guide you through the best way to get the look you love. We also
look at fabric considerations, folding and pinning swag fabric, and more.
After you get the hang of it, it’s easy!
Swagging scarves and throws
Ready-made scarves and throws come in all kinds of wonderful fabrics, from
cotton or blended chenille, to wool-blend fabric, to silk charmeuse or silk-
synthetic blend fabric. You can use any of them to create an easy window
treatment. Scarves are ideal for treatments because they tend to come in
silky fabrics that drape well.
But the big bonus in using throws or scarves is they’re hemmed, finished, and
ready to be fashioned into a simple valance or swag. Here are a few ideas:
 You can drape long scarves across a rod at the top of your window to
give it a romantic look (take a look at “Creating the swag” later in this
chapter for an example).
 You can place a series of simple square scarves (see Figure 7-2),
either matching or not, across the top of your window to give the look
of a valance. You can knot them in place, or use rings with clips to
secure them.
 You can use throws made of chenille, wool, and other fabric types for a
gorgeous and easy way to create a window treatment that keeps the
light out. These throws often have fringed edges that look great when
hanging from a rod. You can also use a crocheted throw for a crafty or
homespun feeling, or any special blanket you want to show off. Just be
sure that your rod and brackets are sufficiently sturdy to handle your
throw’s weight.
With clips and some creative draping and folding, you can create a fan-
tastic and expensive-looking window treatment; check out Figure 7-3.
By draping the top edge of the throw over and toward the front and
attaching rings at the crease, the two rows of fringe become decorative
elements in the curtain.

Swag baby — with a simple drape
Choosing a swag treatment gives you design freedom with tons of choices.
You can make your swag drape symmetrically (with equal fabric on either
side or your window) or asymmetrically; have the side fabric extend down a
foot, 2 feet, or longer; and you choose how large or small you want your swag
“loops and swirls” to be. For a room that needs some privacy, team your
swag with coordinating draperies.
Considering fabric
When thinking about making swags, the key word is “silken.” Any fabric that
makes you think of a soft and silky blouse or dress is what you’re looking for,
so you can achieve the draping. We recommend a polyester charmeuse for a
lightweight swag treatment. Mediumweight polyester crepe fabrics are also
a good choice.

Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

As for using prints versus solids, we prefer solids or one-color Jacquards
(a type of figured, woven fabric; see Chapter 2 for more about Jacquards),
or the simplest, tiniest print. Larger or one-way prints can be hard to use for
swags because the fabric drapes across the window in several directions
(see Chapter 2 for our discussion on one-way prints). You may want to con-
sider picking a neutral accent color, or a solid color that echoes another
color that is already prominent in your decor.
Figuring out your fabric needs
The formula we use to figure the yardage needed for a swag is
 For the width, allow a two-times measurement of your window, mea-
sured from trim to trim. Our window measured 30 inches wide, so our
total width was 60 inches.
 For length (in this project the length is the two areas of the swag that
hang down right and left, called the cascades), plan to add a measure-
ment that reflects the look you like best. For example, if you want the
fabric to hang down so it reaches the midway point of the total length,
add half your total window length to each side. Our window measured
60 inches long, so we allowed 30 inches for each cascade. We added
60 inches to our width of 60 inches for a total measurement of
120 inches.
When you have the width and lengths added together convert your inches
to yards. To do this, simply divide your total by 36. For example, 120 divided
by 36 = 3.3 yards, which you round up to 4 yards of 45-inch wide fabric
(you can always use the extra fabric to make a bow or rosette; see Chapter 8
for more).
To figure out how much fabric you need for other fabric widths, see the
Yardage Conversion Table in the Cheat Sheet in the front of the book.
Getting your gear together
To get started, you need the following:
 A few yards of fabric, preferably something that is silky, light- to medi-
umweight, and that drapes beautifully
 A decorative curtain rod (the swag wraps around it, so it needs a rod
that matches your decor)
 A box of straight pins (see Chapter 5 for the specifics on straight pins)
 Needle and thread for hand tacking (or use a sewing machine, if you
prefer)
 A wrist pincushion
 A piece of tailor’s chalk
116
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 

Draping the swag
The key to getting your swag to look great is to work on the rod:
1. Drape your fabric over the curtain rod on the actual window you’re
dressing.
Make sure your ladder is secure to prevent falls. You probably didn’t
plan for an emergency room visit in your window treatment budget.
2. Carefully pin the folds in place as you go across the curtain, using
long straight pins until you get the look you want.
Don’t be shy — use a ton of pins to keep it secure.
3. Chalk a light line along the area where your fabric will hang on the rod.
After you have your folds in place and you’ve pinned them, run your
chalk parallel with the rod. When you’re ready to put your swag on the
rod after you’ve stitched your folds in place, you’ll have a clear idea
where your fabric needs to go.
4. When removing the swag fabric from the rod with the pins in place,
slide it off carefully.
You’ll be hand tacking the folds in place (or stitching them with your
sewing machine). Don’t forget to take out your pins when you’re finished
sewing.
If you’re using a heavier fabric that keeps slipping off your rod as you’re pin-
ning, try attaching some double-stick tape to the topside of your rod, which
may help keep your fabric in place.
Creating the swag
Follow these easy steps to get great results when making your swag:
1. Find the center of the fabric, measured perpendicular to the selvage
edge, and mark it with straight pins in a straight line (see Figure 7-4).
The selvage is the finished-looking edge of the fabric where the fabric
comes off the loom; you can find the selvage easily because it’s always
parallel to the lengthwise grain.
Center of fabric

the center.
117
Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

2. Toss the ends of your swag fabric over the rod or bar, so that each
side has an equal amount of fabric.
Your pinned line needs to be in the exact center of the rod
(see Figure 7-5).
3. After you have an equal amount of fabric on either side, make folds
where the fabric touches the rod.
The folds must mirror each other on each side and the line of pins used
for marking the center need to be in a vertical line.
4. Using your wrist pincushion and straight pins, pin your folds across
the rod, being very careful not to pin it to the sheers or other drapery
underneath (refer to Figure 7-5).
Use plenty of pins and work methodically, pinning the folds to each
other to keep the folds in place. You can also add pins where no one can
see them, working from the fabric’s underside, which can stay in place
after sewing. (Be mindful of the pins if you’re sewing with a machine.)
5. While still up on the ladder and after completing all your pinning,
take your tailor’s chalk and draw a straight line on the fabric parallel
with the rod.
Doing so gives you a guide for putting the fabric back up on the rod after
sewing.
6. Remove your fabric from the rod and stitch across the folds in the
area that will fall behind the rod.
Remove your pins as you sew.
7. Hand tack the folds in the front so that they stay in place
(see Figure 7-6).
To hand tack your folds, take a needle and a matching color thread and
carefully stitch the folds in place by hand.
8. Slide the rod through the stitched area and use your chalked line to
center and arrange the swag fabric to your liking.

Sassy scarf swags
Scarf swags are a wonderful way to dress up a room by adding romance and a
bit of softness to already existing draperies, such as sheers. They loop and
drape over a decorative rod, jazzing up some plain mini-blinds and providing
a touch of elegance to your windows.
The length details of this project are a matter of taste: Some people like long
scarves that create a puddle on the floor, while other people prefer a shorter
look, perhaps right to the windowsill.
Several pieces of hardware are made especially for holding swag treatments
in place (see Chapter 20). But you really don’t need to spend a lot of money
on these specialty items. To save some dinero, you can use simple knots and
a bit of ribbon — and they look just as nice.
Getting started
You need to assemble these items to create your scarf swag:
 A few yards of silky fabric
To determine how much fabric you need for your window, follow these
steps using your cloth measuring tape.
1. Measure the area of the swag that will go directly over the
window top.
Start on one end of your rod and measure to the lowest part of the
swag, going up and over the rod and back down again until you
reach the opposite end of the rod.

Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

2. Determine the amount of fabric you want to hang down on
either side of your window.
To do this step, measure from the top corner of your rod to wher-
ever you want your swag to descend.
3. Add the two amounts of fabric for your total measure.
For a standard 30 x 60-inch window, use a swag panel measuring
about 180 x 22 inches, hemmed all the way around. The best way
to get a piece of fabric with this measurement is to purchase
21⁄2 yards of fabric, cut it in half lengthwise, and then sew the two
pieces together end to end (sorry for that bit of sewing work
there!). Doing so allows for enough yardage for the loop-around
draping effect you want, as well as the two parts of the treatment
that wrap and hang down the sides of the window.
 Cloth measuring tape
 Curtain rod
 Scissors
 Straight pins
 Ribbon (optional)
Making those scarf swags
To create your scarf swags, follow these simple steps:
1. Find the center of your fabric, measured perpendicular to the selvage
edge, and with pins, make a vertical line down the center (refer to
Figure 7-4 from the previous project).
2. Hang the ends of your fabric over each end of the rod and pin the
swirls and folds you like into place (refer to Figure 7-5 from the previ-
ous project).
Use several pins to keep it secure because the weight of the fabric can
undo your work! Don’t forget to take the pins out after you have the
fabric the way you like it.
3. Attach your draped scarf swag to the rod.
Tying a knot around the bar is the easiest way. Simply wrap your flowing
end around the bar and pull it through the loop. Adjust the fabric to
your liking, making sure not to tug too hard on the part you’ve just
draped (see Figure 7-7).
For a bit of extra security, add a small decorative flourish, such as tying
and knotting (or creating a bow with) a yard of 1-inch-wide satin ribbon,
which wraps around the drapery on the rod (see Figure 7-8).

Hiding Your Unmentionables:
A Simple Lace Shelf Valance
Adding a simple fabric valance over shelving is a great way to hide the
items you use daily but you don’t necessarily want displayed. These valances
are just perfect for an open area between kitchen cabinets, to tuck away
everyday nondisplay dishes, or over the sink to hide a shelf of dishwashing
products. Another ideal use is in the bathroom, where a valance can hide

121
Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

items on top of your medicine chest mirror, adding a bit more discreet storage
(check out the color section for an example of this option). Lace also does
wonders to soften the look of a hard, tile-lined bathroom, and you can pull in
decor colors by choosing a complimentary fabric. (Use a simple 1-inch ten-
sion rod for fastest mounting or a flat rod that extends out a few inches from
the wall for maximum storage capacity.)
A benefit to using lace: You don’t always have to fuss with creating a rod
sleeve or finding clips you like. Some laces feature a pattern of small holes,
called beading, that you can just weave a very thin curtain rod through, or
you can snip thin slits through the fabric and insert the rod through them.
Gathering your supplies
Before starting on your valance, make sure you have the following supplies
nearby:
 One piece of lace, cut to measure
The key to this project is proper measuring. To determine the correct
amount of fabric, use this formula:
1. Measure the width of the area you want to cover and multiply
by 2.
For example, if the area you’re working with is 30 inches wide, cut
a piece of lace that measures 60 inches wide. (Doubling the width
of the window allows the fabric to create natural gathers at the top
when the rod is inserted and hung.)
2. Measure the height of the area and add 4 inches.
For example, if the area height is 18 inches, cut your piece of lace
to measure 22 inches long. Because the fabric is two times the
width, you’ll create natural gathers at the top of the lace when the
rod is inserted.
Although we recommend lace as an ideal fabric for this project, a light,
checked gingham is also a good choice. If you decide to use a nonlace
fabric that needs a hem, add another inch to each measurement for both
the length and the width, and make your hem with the fold-and-fold
method. It’s just pressing the fabric over so that it tucks under a 1⁄2-inch
and then sewing a straight line to create a hem (see Chapter 14 for more
on this way of hemming).

 Chalk
 Iron and ironing board
 Sewing machine or needle and thread

Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 

Making your shelf valance
When creating your shelf valance, follow these easy steps:
1. Measure 31⁄2 inches of lace at the top and fold it over so that a 1⁄2 inch
is tucked under (see Figure 7-9).
2. With a medium-hot iron, press the lace flat.
Be very careful not to burn or melt your synthetic lace because it’s
prone to dissolve under high heat.
3. Stitch across at the 3-inch point, with your sewing machine or by
hand, to create one large sleeve (see Figure 7-10).
4. Create the gathered 1-inch ruffle above the 2-inch rod sleeve below it:
• From the fold at the top of your fabric, measure down an inch and
draw a straight line across with your chalk.
• Sew across the line with your sewing machine or by hand (refer to
Figure 7-10).

Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments
Working with lace
Lace adds a feminine and delicate feel to any
room. Don’t save it only for formal areas; lace is a
terrific fabric to add to your kitchen or bathroom.
Polyester machine-made laces are the best
choice for simple no-sew curtains because they
don’t fray and can be cut in many ways. Here
are a few other tips:
 Cut your panel width to match the area. If
you want to create side seams, make sure
to add an inch on either side.
 For your fabric length, measure down to
where you want the treatment to stop and
add a few inches to the length. If you
decide to trim your lace along the motif at
the bottom, you’ll have adequate fabric to
do so, plus the needed fabric for creating
your rod pocket.
Regarding whether to hem or not, you don’t
need to hem polyester machine-made lace if
you don’t want to sew too much; you can cut
along the design — say, the rounded part of a
heart or the petal of a lace flower — to create a
curvy hem. If you’re working with handmade
lace, don’t cut the bottom because it’ll unravel,
and make sure you create a hem. Cut your lace
carefully and sew it either by hand, sew it slowly
on your sewing machine using a zigzag stitch,
or hem it with a serger.
If you want to make no-sew lace curtains with a
lace that unravels or frays, consider using a bit
of Fray Check on any areas that have been
snipped. Fray Check is like light glue that dries
clear and stops fabrics from fraying. (See
Chapter 5 for the specifics about Fray Check.)
If you’re using cotton lace, always hand wash it
before you begin your project to avoid later
shrinkage (see Chapter 3 for the best way to
pretreat fabric). You don’t need to launder poly-
ester lace beforehand.

5. Insert your rod into the created rod sleeve, gathering the fabric to
create a ruffled effect, and hang your valance.

Dollars and cents: A sample budget
To make the simple but sweet-looking lace shelf
valance with ruffle top, you only need a few
bucks, less than 15, to be exact. Here’s how it
breaks down:
 2 yards of polyester lace: $12
 Coordinating thread: $2
 A piece of chalk: 25 cents
Because this project calls for inexpensive poly-
ester lace, you can make a few different colors
of this valance and change them at your whim
(or for special holidays). What a great way to
brighten up that old area over your sink!

Whipping Up Ultrasuede Curtains
These curtains are very simple window treatments that effectively block light
and give your room a modern appearance. They’re great for young men’s
rooms, or any room where you want a bit of style without any frills or fuss.
We recommend using Ultrasuede, or if you find Ultrasuede too costly, a less
expensive faux-suede similar to Ultrasuede, for these curtains. Ultrasuede
may be the most fantastic fabric ever! It never frays, it’s washable, and it has
the rich appearance of suede without all the hassle. It also comes in many dif-
ferent weights — from lightweight (called “soft” or “light”) to heavyweight
(called “Ambience”). Mediumweight Ultrasuede is best for the projects in this
chapter.
Confusing the right, or face side, and the wrong, or back side, of Ultrasuede is
easy to do. Just remember, the right side is the most evenly saturated with
color, so use a discerning eye before you begin a project.
Basic Ultrasuede panel
A basic Ultrasuede panel can create an ideal look for any informal room. We
suggest you try it in a bedroom, family room, library, or even the kitchen.
This panel curtain adds texture with its suede appearance while providing
privacy and blocking light and drafts.
Getting your basics together
All you need to complete this project are
 Any color of mediumweight Ultrasuede fabric
The measuring is easy. Your panel must be the same size as your
window, including the trim mold (for effective sun blocking). If you want
a fuller look, add a half-width measurement.
For example, for a 30 x 60-inch window, use an extra 15 inches, so your
width would be 45 inches.
 Curtain clips
 Scissors (or pinking shears)
125
Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

Making the panel
Here’s how to make the basic panel, literally 1-2-3:
1. Measure your window’s width and height.
2. Cut your panel the exact size of your window.
If you want a fuller look, add a half-width measurement.
3. Attach curtain clips to the top of the panel, about one every 5 inches,
and hang.
If you want to make this project even easier, skip the clips and grab your
scissors. Cut small slits at the top of your panel and thread a rod of your
choice through the holes. For best results, cut ten 11⁄2-inch vertical slits every
3 inches, starting 11⁄2 inches from the side. These slits need to start about a 
1⁄2-inch down from the top (see Figure 7-11).
You can embellish your panel however you want, or use pinking sheers
instead of scissors to add a different edge. For tips on accessorizing window
treatments, see Chapter 8.
You can also cut an inch of fringe for a Western/Native American flair. The
panel’s length measurement doesn’t change if you choose to use these
extra flairs.
Ultrasuede net curtains
This style of window treatment allows in light and has a cool, organic feel. If
you’re treating an informal room, such as a den, child’s play room, or child’s
bedroom, that needs a fun focal point, try this project. (Kids especially love it
because it allows in light in bits and pieces; they can put their notepads

underneath and draw the images the light and shadows create!) This project
takes a while to correctly cut, but it’s worth the extra effort.
Gathering your supplies
To make Ultrasuede net curtains, you need the following supplies:
 Any color of mediumweight Ultrasuede fabric
To figure out how much fabric you need:
1. Measure across your window for the panel width.
2. For the length, measure from the top of the rod to your win-
dowsill and subtract 15 inches to allow for the natural stretch of
the fabric when it’s hung in place.
For our project, for an usual 30 x 60-inch window, use a piece of
fabric 30 x 45 inches. After you cut the fabric to achieve the net
design, it expands and stretches down to cover the 60-inch-long
window.
 Curtain clips
 Marking chalk
 A mat knife or X-Acto knife
 Safe cutting surface
 Shears
 Yardstick or ruler
Making your net curtains
To create your net curtains, follow these steps:
1. Spread your fabric out on your worktable, weighing down the edges
if necessary.
2. Starting 11⁄2 inches down from the top and from the left-hand side
(see Figure 7-12), cut four 6-inch-long horizontal slits, leaving 2 inches
in between each one.
If your fabric panel is narrower, cut off the extra fabric equally from
either end. If it’s wider, add extra cuts, but always use the cutting mea-
surements we give you for the best results.
3. Measure down another 11⁄2 inches and starting 4 inches from the left-
hand side, cut three 6-inch horizontal slits, each 2 inches apart.
Continue alternating between the four-cut and three-cut lines until you
get to the bottom of the panel.
4. Attach curtain clips every 5 inches at the top of your panel and hang
it from your curtain rod.
127
Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

Ultrasuede cutout curtains
Another project you can try is one that uses unique cutout designs. The
cutouts allow some light through, yet still give privacy. Follow the style we
suggest in “Making your strip curtains” later in this chapter, or you can
design the cutout motif to suit your decor. Try it in most any room, even
more formal rooms like dining and living rooms. You can “fancy” it up by
choosing an ornate cutout, or simplify it with an elegant but elemental one.
This curtain is essentially the same as the basic Ultrasuede panel (measure it
the same way), but you use an X-Acto blade or cutting knife to create a design
similar to a stencil (or you can use an actual stencil if you feel that may help
you get the design you want). Try diamonds, hearts, or triangles — simple
shapes that are dramatic — or try a scalloped edge on the bottom (see
“Creating your cutout curtains” later in this chapter).
The best way to keep your fabric flat and secure when cutting with a sharp
blade is to apply a paperweight, heavy books, or other weights on the fabric.
(Fabric weights are available commercially, but they’re a waste of money.)
Fabric markers and Ultrasuede aren’t a great mix: This fabric may absorb the
ink a bit too well and not wipe away. If you need to draw your image with
something finer than tailor’s chalk, work on the wrong, or back side, with a
nonbleeding ballpoint pen.

Getting it all together
To start, you need these supplies:
 Any color of mediumweight Ultrasuede fabric
To determine how much fabric you need:
1. Measure across your window to determine your panel’s width.
2. For the length, measure from the top of the rod to your 
windowsill.
Your panel needs to be the same size as your window, including
the trim mold (for effective sun blocking). If you prefer a fuller
look, add a half-width measurement. For example, for a 30 x 60-inch
window, use an extra 15 inches, so your width is 45 inches.
 Curtain clips
 Marking chalk
 A mat knife or X-Acto knife
 Safe cutting surface
 Shears
 Yardstick or ruler
 Stencil (optional)
Creating your cutout curtains
To make your cutout curtain creations, follow these easy steps:
1. Spread your fabric out on your safe cutting surface or worktable,
weighing down the edges if necessary.
2. With your yardstick or ruler, determine the size of each cutout and
the space between each one.
You want equal space between each cutout and to the right and left
edges of your panel.
3. Use your chalk to create the pattern you want to cut out of your fabric
(see Figure 7-13 for inspiration).
Start at the center and work left, and then right, to get an even amount
of motifs and spaces across the bottom.
Consider drawing a light horizontal chalk line across the “top” of your
design area. Doing so helps you keep your designs straight when draw-
ing freehand.
129
Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

4. Cut out your motifs using your knife.
Work slowly and take a break from your work once in a while to see if
you’re doing it right.
5. Attach curtain clips every 5 inches at the top of your panel and hang
it from your curtain rod.
Ultrasuede strip curtains
This ultramodern “curtain” allows plenty of light to come through, sways in
the breeze, and is sure to be a conversation piece among guests. It’s created
with horizontal panels of Ultrasuede (or other faux-suede fabric) held
together with rows of safety pins that add a fun, modern-looking metallic
look. Try it in any informal room. You can also try it in doorways, where it
allows in sound, air, and light.
For this project, use silver-toned clips if your safety pins are silver, and brass
or gold-tone if your safety pins are gold-toned. Buy one large box of safety
pins to be sure of the uniformity of the pins. Believe it or not, not all 2-inch
safety pins are the same. When they’re grouped as in this project, a stray
really stands out. You can buy safety pins by the box at dollar stores or at
any crafts store (see Chapter 20).

Gathering your supplies
Before you begin, make sure you have these supplies handy:
 Any color of mediumweight Ultrasuede fabric
You may want to try alternating colors on different panels — say, blue,
red, blue, red — or you can always use the same color throughout.
To determine your fabric needs:
1. Measure your window width.
Your fabric width will be your exact window measurement, includ-
ing your trim mold (for effective sun blocking).
2. To determine your length, measure from the top of your rod
to the window sill, but plan on allowing for 2 inches of 
air space — the 2-inch area that the safety pins will take up —
between each panel.
You may need to make your bottom panel a bit longer than the
panels above it if your total length isn’t an even number. The panel
will look fine if you need to take this step. Don’t make it shorter; it
may seem like your last panel was a poorly planned afterthought.
As for the proportion of the panels, unless your window is really
oversize, stick with the 10- to 14-inch measurement for each panel.
You’ll get a better effect this way.
For a 30 x 60-inch window, use four 10 x 30-inch Ultrasuede panels and
one 14 x 30-inch Ultrasuede panel, which you can safety pin together. The
total panel length with 2-inch safety pin increments is about 62 inches.
 Cloth measuring tape
 Curtain clips
 A measuring tape or yardstick
 About 130 two-inch safety pins (all from the same box/boxes)
 Shears
Making your strip curtains
To make your strip curtains, follow these steps:
1. Cut your fabric into the correct panel measurements, as discussed
in the previous section.
2. Pin the four 10-inch panels together using the safety pins, as in
Figure 7-14.
The pins need to be an inch apart. Make sure all the safety pins face
the same direction and are evenly spaced, to create a professional 
no-sew look.
131
Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

Your bottom panel is 14 inches long. Depending on how deeply you
pinned your safety pins into the panels, you may need to trim a small
amount off to adjust to your window height.
3. Use your measuring tape or yardstick to ensure an even bottom
border.
4. Clip your curtain clips onto the top of your curtain and hang with
the coordinating rod of your choice.
Fashioning Frayed-Edge Draperies
Frayed-edge draperies are a simple treatment and require no sewing at all,
just a few clips for hanging. This treatment lends a natural, organic-looking
feeling when the frayed ends move in the breeze. You can use this unique
frayed look in any room; try a simple fabric for an informal room, or a more
ornate fabric for a formal room.
When choosing a fabric, select one that easily unravels to get the frayed
fringe effect. Loosely woven fabrics, such as simple cottons, are great for this
project, while cotton twills and polyester fabrics don’t work because their
weave is too tight. Before you commit to yardage, get a sample and clip a
small piece of your loose-weave fabric to test it. Pull threads from both the
side and the bottom. Are you getting the effect you desire?

Gather your supplies
Before starting this project, gather these necessary supplies:
 A few yards of fabric that unravels (see the earlier discussion in the pre-
vious section about selecting a fabric that unravels)
To determine how much fabric you need:
1. Add 12 inches to your width measurement.
Six inches on either side gives you adequate fabric to allow for the
initial trimming and then the fraying process, plus a little fabric to
spare in case you want the fringe a bit wider. (Snipping fringe that
is too long is a lot less work than taking too much fabric off to
begin with and trying to correct it later.)
2. Add 7 inches to your length measurement to allow for the fabric
that drapes over the top of the treatment.
For a 30 x 60-inch drape, use a piece of fabric that is 45 (because fabric
doesn’t come in 42-inch widths) x 67 inches.
 Curtain clips
 Measuring tape or yardstick
 Shears
 Sewing machine with appropriate thread (optional)
Get ready to fray
Here’s how to fray your fabric and make your draperies: 
1. Cut your panel to the correct measurement.
2. To prep your fabric for fraying, trim off an inch or two from the left
and right sides.
Doing so makes pulling the threads easier in order to create the fringe.
(You don’t have to trim the top and bottom, which fray well on their own.)
3. Unravel each side, pulling outside threads one or two at a time.
Your goal is to obtain an inch of fringe all the way around, top, bottom,
and sides. Keep your measuring tape or yardstick handy so you can
keep all your sides even.
4. When you’re done, simply fold 7 inches of fabric over to the front of
the panel (see Figure 7-15).
133
Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

5. Add your clips at the top of the fold and hang your panel from your
rod (shown in Figure 7-15).
If you don’t mind doing a bit of light sewing, consider zigzag stitching around
the edges where the fringe starts, as a final step, to secure your frayed fringe.
(This step is a nice extra, but the panel still holds well without the added
stitching.)
Cruising with Car Wash Curtains
Yep, they look just like the “curtains” you encounter in the drive-through car
wash. You get a flowing, festive look with this treatment, which is also terrific
in doorways. When the curtain is stationary, you get plenty of sun protection,
and when the wind blows through the window, you can enjoy plenty of
movement. This window treatment is especially great for kids’ rooms, and
they’re always fun to look at and fun to touch. (Be careful with very young
children because they love to tug and pull up on the streamers; it may be
a safety hazard.)
You can make these curtains in several different ways. You can use ribbon,
Ultrasuede, or plastic shower curtain liners. None requires any sewing and
they can all be easily made with just a pair of sharp scissors.

Ribbon car wash curtains
You can use strips of fabric to create this curtain, but we prefer to use
lengths of ribbon. One-inch-wide ribbon is a great choice for this project.
Don’t limit your ribbon color choice to only one shade; try red, white, and
blue, all pastels, a variety of colors to create a rainbow-like effect using the
full color spectrum, or gradient-toned blues, for a moiré effect, which can
give your window a wavy, watery-looking appearance.
If you choose to use ribbons and you’re treating an average-size window or
larger, definitely look into buying from a ribbon wholesaler to save money
(see the resources section of Chapter 20 for more info).
Gathering your supplies
To make this curtain, you need the following items:
 Strips of fabric or ribbon
To figure your fabric or ribbon needs:
1. Take the width of your window and multiply by 2. That’s the
number of 1-inch wide ribbons you need.
2. Take the length of your window, multiply by 2, and then add an
inch (which represents the extra length needed to create the
knotted loop that holds it in place).
This measurement represents how long each ribbon needs to be.
For example, for a standard 30 x 60-inch window, use sixty 1 x 121-inch
long strips of fabric, or try ribbon cut to the same dimensions, which
you knot and hang along the rod of your choice.
 Scissors
Making the curtain
Check out Figure 7-16, which is the simplest way to create ribbon car wash
curtains, and follow these steps:
1. Measure your ribbons, allowing for the extra inch of fabric needed
to make the loop and knot.
2. Cut the ribbons to the appropriate length.
3. Loop them around right on the rod of your choice.
You can do it any way that’s pleasing to you. In Figure 7-16, the loop
tucks under the downward hanging ends. Just be sure the two ends are
of equal length before you pull the ribbon tight to secure your loop.
135
Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

Ultrasuede car wash curtains
Using Ultrasuede (or another brand of faux-suede fabric) is another way to
create these fun curtains. You get less of a breezy effect because faux-suedes
are heavier, but you’ll get more sun protection, too. Add this treatment to any
informal room.
Getting your supplies together
When making Ultrasuede car wash curtains, use the following supplies:
 Any color of mediumweight Ultrasuede fabric
To figure out how much you need:
1. Measure your window width and add 15 inches to your
measurement.
2. Measure your desired length.
For a window measuring 30 x 60 inches, use a piece of fabric that
measures 45 x 60 inches.
 Curtain clips

 A measuring tape or yardstick, if you have a hard time keeping the strips
an even 1-inch wide
You could also use a clear ruler, which allows you to see the fabric
better.
 Scissors
Assembling the curtain
Follow these simple instructions to assemble the curtain:
1. Cut your fabric to achieve the correct size panel.
2. From the bottom of the panel, cut 1-inch-wide strips all the way up
until you reach 3 inches from the top of the panel.
3. Attach curtain clips to hang.
Shower liner car wash curtains
This project is fun, perfect for a child’s room. It’s an easy way for you to
indulge them in their three favorite colors. Check out the discount and dollar
stores for shower liners, where they’re a bargain, and you can pick up your
shower curtain hooks there, too. Red, white, and blue, or red, clear, and blue
are nifty combos.
Gathering your gear
To begin this fun project, you need these items:
 Three different-colored shower liners (one can be clear)
 To get the right measurements for your curtain:
1. Simply add 15 inches to your window width measurement.
2. For length, just snip the shower curtain liner to the length you
need.
For a window measuring 30 x 60-inches long, use a piece of shower
curtain liner that measures 45 x 60.
 A measuring tape or yardstick, if you have a hard time keeping the strips
an even 1-inch wide, or you could use a clear ruler
 Scissors
 Shower curtain hooks
 Clothespins (optional)

Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

Creating the curtain
You can make this curtain in a snap, but don’t be afraid to work slowly to get
it done right:
1. Line up the holes of the three shower curtain liners so that you can
make sure that your strips line up.
2. Clip the three liners together with clothespins if you want to keep the
slippery liners from moving as you cut.
3. Starting from the bottom, cut each shower liner into a panel that mea-
sures 45 x 60 inches.
4. From the bottom of each panel, cut 2-inch-wide strips all the way up,
until you reach 3 inches from the top of the panel (where the pre-
punched holes are).
5. Hang the layered shower liners on your curtain rod with plastic or
metal shower curtain hooks (see Figure 7-17).

Avoiding the Sewing Machine: 
No-Sew Shades
A nice alternative to curtains and draperies, shades are great for rooms of
small proportions, such as half baths, and the two fun shades in this section
are perfect for young adult rooms.
Shades with color transfers
Color copy heat transfers are wonderful, and you can make any photo, art
image, or original art into a heat transfer at a copy shop. This project is fun
for kids, and a nice way to personalize a room.
This project makes one shade, and you can choose any motif: an Andy
Warhol–type, four-photo self-portrait; a floral collage; a tribute to favorite
music groups past and present; whatever your heart desires. You can make a
photomontage of the person who occupies the room, or use this treatment as
a tool to designate sides of a room that are shared by more than one child.
How about a design of one child’s artwork? Maybe you want to try a black-
and-white theme: Cut out a bunch of pictures of zebras and go to town. The
options are totally fun and truly limitless.
Use a fabric roll-up shade if you can; plastics don’t allow the transfer to
adhere (but see the note in Step 2 in “Getting started on your shade”).
Gathering your gear
When making this shade, you need these basics:
 Color copy of the image/s of your choice
 One fabric shade 
 Hammer
 Mounting hardware to mount shade
 Sewing machine with zigzag (optional; see Step 2 in the next section)
139
Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

Getting started on your shade
Making this shade is as easy as 1-2-3:
1. Take your image to the copy shop.
The largest color copy transfer the copy shop can make is about 
17 x 11 inches.
2. Follow the directions on adhering a heat transfer the copy shop pro-
vides you (if it doesn’t, see “The art of heat transfers” sidebar in this
chapter).
If you can’t find a fabric shade, iron your heat transfer onto a white, 100-
percent cotton piece of fabric and sew it onto your shade with your
sewing machine’s zigzag feature.
3. Put your shade up with your hammer and mounting brackets or other
appropriate hardware.
Clear Contac paper “shades”
You make this “shade” with adjacent squares covered with clear Contac
paper, which is a great material to work with for many reasons: It allows in
light, while still offering some privacy, and it’s cheap and easy to use, so you
can change your mind often, or redecorate your window for each season, hol-
iday, whatever your whim.
Sneak a peak at the end of this project to see the finished job (Figure 7-18).
This simple project gives any informal room a fun feeling. Consider making
this shade for a modern bedroom, where the square panels are echoed
140
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 
The art of heat transfers
The best way to do a heat transfer is to place it
exactly where it needs to go (check to see if it’s
straight with an L-square) and iron it on the high-
est heat your iron has, with no steam. Lift the
corner to check your work and see whether it’s
taking to the fabric. Keep the heat and pressure
up. When it starts to take, starting at the top, lift
the paper a little at a time until you get to the
bottom of the transfer. After you remove the
paper, remember to iron only on the back of the
shade. You can’t directly iron onto the transfer,
or it will burn and ruin your iron!

elsewhere in your decor. Try it in a child’s bathroom or bedroom; it’s a great
opportunity to let your kids’ artwork have a better place to shine than the
refrigerator door.
To create a hanging window shade, apply clear Contac paper over equal-size
pieces of paper, which laminates the images so they stay in place and the
shade pieces maintain their integrity.
Gathering your gear
Before you start, get the following items ready:
 Any kind of interesting paper that matches your decor
Some ideas include colorful construction paper, a color-page sheet
from a newspaper (check out foreign-language newspapers if you’re
matching an ethnic decor), beautiful wallpaper or wrapping paper,
vintage greeting cards, color copies of photos, images from children’s
books, or anything you like. For kids’ rooms, try spelling out names,
words, or messages by using a letter on each Contac-covered square.
To figure out how many squares you need, follow these steps:
1. Measure your window length and width.
2. Figure how many identically sized squares you need to reach
your windowsill, interspersed with 2-inch clips between each
square.
Try 4 x 4-inch squares because they break down nicely for a 
30 x 60-inch window and provide a variety of images. For a window
of this size, use about seven or eight rows of squares, and they’ll
be ten squares long each, with 2-inch paper clips between each
square. You can do the simple math; now get cracking on finding
all those images!
 6 yards of clear Contac paper
 Curtain clips
 Curtain rod
 Hole puncher
 Scissors
 One box of 2-inch paper clips
Because paper clips can vary in style and color from company to com-
pany, use all your paper clips from one box for a uniform appearance.
141
Chapter 7: Making Easy No-Sew and Low-Sew Window Treatments

Making your shade
To create your shade, follow these steps:
1. Cut your decorative paper into 4 x 4-inch squares, enough to fill your
window.
2. Apply one layer of the clear Contac over one side of the decorative
paper and then the opposite side.
Doing so “laminates” the image, suspending it between the Contac
paper.
3. Cut the Contac paper–covered image leaving a 1⁄2-inch edge of Contac
around each square.
4. Punch a hole at the top and bottom of each square, being sure to keep
the holes within the 1⁄2-inch of clear Contac paper.
5. Arrange the squares in columns and attach with large paper clips.
Be sure to only punch one hole at the top for the bottom squares.
6. Attach the top paper clips to your curtain clips.
7. String along your rod and hang (see Figure 7-18).

Accessorize! Window
Details That Dazzle
In This Chapter
 Adding punch to your window treatments
 Applying decorative trim
 Enlightening your views with tiebacks
 Working with tassels
S
o you’re ready to add even more panache to your window creations, eh?
Well, with just a little extra effort, you can customize your window
treatments and create fun, one-of-a-kind draperies and curtains that wow
your guests.
In this chapter, we show you how to add decorative flourishes to window
treatments. We also discuss basic decorations you can add to curtain panels,
together with the variety of trims available, the different styles of tiebacks
you can use, and how to apply tassels.
Decorating Your Curtain’s “Face”
Concerning window treatments, even a bit of embellishment goes a long way.
Just like some people apply makeup to their face to improve or highlight
their features, you can consider adding a few extra decorative touches in the
form of trims to your window treatment’s “face,” especially if you’ve chosen a
solid fabric. You can also punch up the style of prints by adding even more
shine, texture, and dimension to your treatment with paillettes, sequins,
rhinestones, studs, and other little extras. Considering how much style these
little extras bring and how little time (and money) it takes to add them, you
may even want to attach more than one.

Adding fabric embellishments
You can make a wide variety of beautiful extras with fabric and add them
to your treatment’s face. Just don’t forget these few considerations in this
section. For instance, use any fabric that pleases you — it can match or
contrast with your treatment — but make sure it’s a fabric that has enough
body (is weighty, strong, or stiff enough) to hold the shape you’ve chosen.
Rosettes
Rosettes are little fabric embellishments that are associated with the design
style of the Regency period (1830s England, when embellishment was
robustly, but tastefully applied). They mimic classic floral shapes like roses
and choux (which resemble cabbage roses). You can use them to accent
curves or call attention upward toward valances and swag corners. They’re
traditionally made from the same fabric as the treatment, but that doesn’t
mean you can’t use a contrasting fabric for your rosettes. Either way, they
draw the eye to wherever you place them, so be sure to choose well and to
apply them evenly and consistently to your creation.
Consider adding rosettes to our balloon valance project, or to the area
where the swag and cascade meet in the swag and cascade treatment, both
in Chapter 15. You can also use a rosette to help disguise, if necessary, the
area where nondecorative brackets or other purely functional hardware
pieces are attached to the wall. You can add smaller rosettes to your tiebacks
for added charm (check out “Tweaking the Look with Tiebacks” later in this
chapter for more info).
Keep the size of the rosette consistent with the treatment’s proportion. If
you’re adding to a drapery, your rosettes can be larger, but keep them
smaller for a shorter curtain.
You can also make easy rosettes from wire-edged ribbon. Start from the
center of the flower by curling a bit of the ribbon inward and pinching, so
you have a firm center. Then, working outward, move in a circle, pinching to
create form and creating the floral shape as you work.
Bows and Maltese crosses
Simple bows comprise two loops and two tails that hang downward. You can
create them from ribbon, or use matching or contrasting fabrics. You can add
them to the corners of a swag treatment or use them to make pretty tiebacks
for any treatment. Bows impart a sweet and homey feeling to curtains, per-
fect for a kitchen or family room/den treatment.
A Maltese cross is also made either from ribbon or fabric, but consists of four
loops and no tails, with either a small button or small circle of fabric in the
center. It gives a more formal feel to draperies and looks quite elegant in a
living room or dining room.
144
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 

Using paillettes and sequins 
and Be-Dazzling
Paillettes or sequins can jazz up a window treatment, and rhinestones or
studs adhered with a hand-held mechanical applicator (like a Be-Dazzler) are
always a universal hit with little (and not so little) girls, so apply them with
gusto!
Paillettes and sequins
Paillettes are round, flat, and usually metallic-finished discs with tiny holes at
the top, which enable you to attach them to fabric. Paillettes come in two
basic sizes — 20 millimeter and 30 millimeter — and have matte or shiny fin-
ishes. Some have a mirror-like finish, which especially adds dazzle and shine.
Consider adding them to any of the Ultrasuede curtain projects in Chapter 7.
We love paillettes on an ultramodern panel treatment as a simple yet dazzling
embellishment reminiscent of the 1960s. You can also try adding paillettes to
a light drapery or curtain made with sheer or semisheer fabric. When the
wind moves your treatment, the paillettes really strut their stuff.
Sequins are similar to paillettes, but they’re smaller, their holes are in the
middle, and they can come in many different shapes, such as squares, trian-
gles, or circles. You can buy sequins loose or prestrung. The prestrung
sequins are lined up and great for applying evenly along seams or hems.
Sequins look great when distributed randomly across a solid fabric, or to
mimic a constellation. You can also add them to prints to highlight areas of a
motif, such as scattered inside the petals of a flower, or along the “collar” of
an animal.
How many paillettes or sequins you add per window treatment is your deci-
sion, but keep scale in mind how your embellishments look when viewed
from afar. If you’re applying paillettes or sequins to a long drapery, don’t
skimp, or you may lose the effect. On the other hand, if you’re applying them
to a shorter curtain in a small bathroom, space your paillettes out so the
scale is appropriate for the closer quarters.
Adding paillettes does have one major drawback. You have to sew them
individually onto the window treatment fabric. If you don’t need to use many,
you can sew them on by hand. Hand sewing is the easiest way, but you can
use a sewing machine, too. Just use a zigzag stitch with the stitch length set
to zero. 
If you’re applying paillettes to a swag treatment, you may want to tape or pin
them on — or even hand tack them — while your swag fabric is up on the
rod. That way you can see which way the fabric is flowing so the paillettes
hang down properly (not stuck in limbo, pointing to the left or right) and give
you the look you want.
145
Chapter 8: Accessorize! Window Details That Dazzle

Be-Dazzling
Applying stones and studs with a hand-held mechanical applicator — the
best known and, to our minds, the one that gives the best results, is the 
Be-Dazzler — is a whimsical and inexpensive way to add a bit of glitz. One by
one, you attach tiny rhinestones, studs, or other jewel-like embellishments
(with the help of little metal findings that hold them in place) to fabric with
the Be-Dazzler, which costs about $20 and is available at many crafts stores.
You have plenty to choose from in terms of styles of stones and studs,
including
 Artificial pearls
 Clear and colored rhinestones
 Metal mirrors
 Silver- and gold-tone metal studs in star, heart, flower, square, and round
shapes
To create a motif or other pattern, consider applying a dot of tailor’s chalk
to the right side of your fabric to mark where you want to add each stone
or stud.
Buy more stones or studs than you think you need. Erring on the side of more
is always less frustrating, and a 250-count package only costs between $10
and $15.
After you have your materials picked out, consider the following design
ideas:
 Adding rhinestones in a line or swirl on your fabric’s face. You also can
add these extras to a curtain’s trim.
 Scattering stars all across the fabric to create a constellation effect.
 Creating motifs, like hearts, starbursts, or others.
 Spelling out your little girl’s name in bright rhinestones.
Your options are limitless. Whatever design you try, you’re bound to have fun!
Adding Charm with Decorative Trim
Who doesn’t love the notions and accessories section of a fabric store? A
coordinating or contrasting trim for your new window treatment adds style
and covers up unfinished or not-so-perfectly sewn hems. Use trim to soften
the look of a crisp fabric or to draw the eye upward or downward. See
Figure 8-1 for a peak at a few of our favorite trims.
146
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 

Bullion fringe resembles the epaulette
braid used on military uniforms.
Cord consists of yarns twisted together
to create one length of trim.  It comes plain 
or with a lip that is meant to be sewn into 
seams for piping.
Fringes can have plain or fancy headings
and many types of skirts - pompoms, feathers,
cut fringe, balls, tassels, or beads of many types.
Jasmines feature tassels layered with cut
fringe skirts and a decorative heading.
Moulinees are fringes made of multicolored yarns.
Ribbons and flat trim come in many styles.  They
are plain, woven, or embroidered with motifs.
Chair tie is tassels joined by a length of
matching cord.

Chapter 8: Accessorize! Window Details That Dazzle

If you can, buy your trim at the same time that you buy your fabric, simply
because mixing and matching is easier when you have the fabric and trim
selections in front of you. If you must use two sources, keep samples nearby
in your color notebook that we recommend and explain in Chapter 2.
Be sure to buy more trim than you think you need. Adding a 1⁄2-yard to your
measurement doesn’t cost much, but it can save time and frustration.
Perfectly matching two pieces of trim cut at different times and sewing them
together can be difficult to do. It pays in time and frustration to be sure you
have enough trim the first time around.
Choosing your decorative trim
Trim needs to enhance the look you’re trying to achieve without overwhelming
it. Here are some ideas for trims that complement various fabrics and styles:
 If you want to add a bit of festivity to curtains made from Mexican blan-
kets or from fabric that resembles a serape, try ball fringe.
 If you have Victorian-style formal velvet draperies, bullion fringe is great
(and your cat will love it, too!).
 If you’re going for a Louis XIV look with ornate brocade fabric, add some
tassel fringe to complement it.
 If hanging fringe doesn’t suit your taste — you’re afraid your toddler will
make a day of pulling it off or you want an embellishment with a some-
what less froufrou feeling — consider adding a ribbon trim. It adds a bit
of interest but doesn’t sway in the breeze (and can’t be tugged at by
curious little hands).
148
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 
Budgeting for trim
Though your trim is a smaller part of your treat-
ment compared to your fabric, don’t consider it
as an afterthought, because trim can be more
expensive in total than your treatment fabric.
Simple polyester ribbon trim starts out at $4 a
yard and goes up, according to fiber content
and whether the ribbon was loomed or further
adorned with beads or embroidery.
Sometimes you can buy ribbon by the spool
(which can contain from 10 to 100 yards, depend-
ing on the spool; always inquire about the total
length), which can be a better and cheaper way
to purchase ribbon. We found polyester gros-
grain on a spool for $4.50 for 10 yards and poly-
ester satin for $20 for 100 yards. 
Beaded trims are always more expensive.
Rayon chenille ball fringe is $4 a yard, while
beaded ball fringe is $40 a yard. Tassel fringe
starts out at $12 to $14 per yard and goes up. If
a trim style is being remaindered, you can get a
better deal; look for closeout sales in shops and
online.

Rickrack is another great option. This wavy-shaped, lightly textured
edging material comes in many sizes and gives an old-fashioned or coun-
try feeling. It looks great on informal treatments; gingham cafe curtains
with rickrack are a kitchen classic.
 If you want to elongate your window’s appearance, add trim to the top
and bottom of a treatment to draw the eye up and down. You can mag-
nify this effect by choosing a trim with hanging threads, such as fringe
or tassels. The longer the trim and the more it hangs down, the stronger
the enhancement.
You’re not limited to one type of trim. In fact, to add dimension, consider
sewing a flat braid trim onto a length of ribbon, and then attaching the
adorned ribbon to your curtain or drapery. When the braid and ribbon are
the same color or tone, you get a more cohesive textured effect, but a con-
trasting braid on a neutral ribbon also looks beautiful.
If you plan to wash your window treatment, you have to preshrink your trim.
Some trim is washable by hand, but much of it shrinks a great deal when
washed — for example, trim with rayon content is especially notorious for
shrinking — which pushes your budget up a bit, because you need more than
expected.
Test a sample first before you commit to your total yardage. Some trim isn’t
washable under any circumstances, especially those trims with delicately
fringed or tassled skirts or beads of any sort. Sequins that are glued on
instead of sewn may pop off when exposed to water. When in doubt, ask a
salesperson to evaluate your potential trim purchase, and bring along your
project book that contains your fabric swatch and care information from the
bolt or cylinder tag.
Attaching fringe trims
Fringe trims usually consist of two parts: the fringe itself (sometimes called
the skirt) and the top band of fabric from which the fringe hangs (sometimes
called the heading). This band can be made of braided material, or some-
times it looks like a sheer fabric ribbon.
Needle and thread versus glue
The two ways to attach decorative trim by thread and needle (either by hand
or machine) are
 Using a topstitch or zigzag stitch and attaching it directly to the fabric
 Sewing it into a seam
Most trim has a decorative heading that you can use to topstitch or zigzag
stitch into place. However, when the trim features a 1⁄4- or 1⁄2-inch heading
149
Chapter 8: Accessorize! Window Details That Dazzle

made of ribbon or a woven lip or edging of any type, it’s meant to disappear
inside a seam. If you’re tucking it inside two pieces of fabric (as between
the face of your treatment fabric and its lining), pin or glue stick it between
the two seams and sew it together in the same way that you sew in piping
(see Chapter 18).
If you prefer, a simpler way of attaching this type of trim is sewing or hot
gluing it to the back (or underside) of your treatment fabric, making sure that
the ribbon lip is well out of sight.
When the trim is flat and consists of one piece, like ribbon or galloon trim,
you need to stitch along the outer edge of one side, and then do the same to
the other side. Stitching in the same direction for both sides can help you
avoid puckering or pinching.
Another way to attach trim is with glue. Glue from a hot glue gun is a quick,
easy way to attach most trims. Some liquid fabric glues are also available on
the market that you may want to try; look for one that says, “dries clear and
flexible” on the label.
Hot glue and liquid fabric glue are both used the same way: Dot them between
the fabric and the trim and press down. Use a weight if you’re attaching trim
to a heavier fabric. If you’re using liquid fabric glue, pin your trim so that
it stays in place until the glue dries. Test it out before you make an all-project
commitment; use a trim sample and attach it to a fabric sample to make sure
you like the quick-and-easy results of glue.
Many people like to use spray adhesive or a glue stick to attach the trim to
the fabric before sewing it into place. These adhesives take the place of pins
and because they’re water soluble, they’re only temporary. You need to sew
the trim into place after the glue dries.
Tips and tricks
The following are some quick tips and tricks that can make your job working
with a trim much easier.
 Don’t be afraid of corners. Going around corners to add trim is easy.
All the projects in this book call for a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, so simply
follow the seam allowance, even around the curves. You may have to
fold your trim a bit if the curve is tight; simply take the heading and pin
a small pleat in it at the corner and stitch it in place.
 Don’t stress out your trim! Never stretch decorative trim to gain length
because doing so can cause the area where the trim is attached to
pucker or buckle, and otherwise disfigure your project.
If you’re trapping the lip or edge of your trim (the nondecorative area) —
sewing it between two pieces of fabric into a seam — be sure to check
150
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 

out the instructions for attaching piping in Chapter 18. You need to
stitch the trim to the correct side of your fabric, trapping the lip or edge
of your trim in the seam allowance (the part that you tuck under and
sew to create your finished edge) area of the fabric.
 Don’t cut your trim until you’ve sewn it all the way onto your window
treatment. You may find that you need a bit extra at the ends, so you
can wrap the trim from the front around the edge onto the back of your
fabric for a more finished look. If your trim is too bulky to wrap around,
clip it at the edge and overcast it by hand.
 Don’t remove the chainstitch on trim with ornate fringed skirts. The
stitching keeps the skirt yarns flat. Don’t remove it until you’re finished
attaching it, because the stitching keeps the fringe out of the seam when
you sew, and it also keeps it from getting unruly around hot or even
regular glue.
Adding weight with beaded fringe
Beaded fringe is a type of trim that features tiny rows of beads that hang ver-
tically, usually from a length of decorative braid, but sometimes from a length
of sheer ribbon. Some absolutely stunning beaded fringe styles are available,
including glass beads, wooden beads, plastic beads, and bead alternatives
such as shells and buttons.
Besides adding charm, beaded fringe also has a utilitarian advantage: It adds
weight to curtains and draperies, so they hang better. Glass bead trims obvi-
ously weigh more than plastic and wood, so keep that in mind. You want to
match your beaded trim weight to your fabric weight as closely as possible.
If you’re using a sheer fabric, be sure that it can support the weight of real
glass without ruining your treatment’s drape. If not, you may want to go with
a glass substitute. Try plastic (usually made of acrylic, which can also be a
real money saver), or even a light wood fringe. Heavier draperies or curtains
can always support glass-and-braid trims (for more weight, add special cur-
tain weights; see Chapter 4). You can pin your trim on fabric before you sew
to test it.
You can attach a beaded trim with a decorative heading by hot gluing it or
sewing it by hand or with a machine. If you decide to use a sewing machine,
work very slowly. Machine sew both edges of the braid to keep it firmly in
place, protecting the beads from damage as you go; you can cover them with
masking tape. The braided heading usually has two lines of stitched thread in
place, employed in its construction. You can sew over these stitched lines as
a guide and to prevent an overabundance of thread on the heading’s face.
Tuck the beaded trim attached to a length of nondecorative sheer ribbon into
a seam so that no one can see the ribbon. Sew it with a zigzag stitch, as in
Figure 8-2.

Edging curtains with ribbons
Adding ribbon to the bottoms and along the edges of curtains is a nice way
to incorporate a bit of color, texture, or pattern to solid curtains or more
drama to printed ones. First, pin or use a glue stick to set your ribbon in
place and then attach it using a zigzag stitch on each edge of your ribbon,
as in Figure 8-3, sewing all the way across both edges.
If highlighting the zigzag stitch complements your treatment’s overall look
(say, for a crafty or ethnic design; see Chapter 10), consider using a
contrasting-color thread.
You want to find ribbon that has a bit of heft or texture or both, to comple-
ment the heavier weight of decorator fabrics. Try grosgrain ribbons or
any patterned or textured ribbon. Very thin satin or sheer ribbon is pretty
and works well on a sheer treatment, but it’s slippery, sometimes hard to
sew and handle, and tends to snag and show dirt. If you sew well, try it out.
Otherwise, you may want to save it for wrapping birthday presents and
creating hairstyles instead.
Tweaking the Look with Tiebacks
Tiebacks are material that you wind around your drapery or curtain and then
loop over a hook attached to the wall, providing just the right finishing touch.

They’re fun window treatment accessories that provide you with another
chance to show off your creative side as well as allow light into your room.
Depending on where you place your tiebacks, your curtains adopt a different
shape and silhouette, and let in differing amounts of light. For example, plac-
ing your tiebacks high (more than halfway above the middle of your treat-
ment length) allows in more light; placing them low allows in less. Take a look
at Chapter 4 for an illustration of different tieback placements.
If you chose a fairly neutral or one-color fabric for your window treatment,
but still want to add a bit of flavor to your creation, a tieback can be a great
way of picking up a contrasting color or motif from elsewhere in your decor.
Of course, because tiebacks have a functional aspect, they have to work, not
just look great. When you consider how to make your tieback, keep in mind
the weight of your drapery or curtain. A lightweight treatment can employ a
tieback made from nearly any material, and a light cup hook is enough to
keep it in place. However if you’re using an ornate or heavyweight fabric for
your treatment, you need to use a fabric of equal weight, and you may need
to use a molly bolt (a securing device that expands inside the wall) to attach a
substantial hook to your walls for a tieback strong enough for your curtains.
Creating basic fabric tiebacks
Fabric tiebacks are just long rectangles of fabric with plastic hooks attached
at their ends, or that are tied or knotted together at each end to create a
loop. Grab your cloth measuring tape; you need it to make these easy
tiebacks. To make yours in any fabric that pleases you, follow these steps:
1. Hang your drapery or curtain and scoop the fabric away from the
window toward the frame.
2. Loop your measuring tape around the drapery or curtain so it mimics
a real tieback and note how many inches of tape you need.
If you plan to create a tieback that ties into a knot or bow, be sure to add
a few extra inches for adequate fabric to create the decorative ends.
3. Add 1 inch for a seam and you have your length.
For your width, consider the weight of your window treatment fabric
and the look you want to achieve. Will your tieback fabric be contrast-
ing, and so may be better shown off with a wide tieback? Perhaps a 
5-inch tieback would work. Do you want your tieback to “disappear” into
your treatment, and so a thinner tieback may suffice? Perhaps a 2-inch
tieback is the ticket. Whatever width you decide to use, double the
width and add 1 inch for your seam allowance. For example, if you want
a 2-inch-wide band, your width measurement needs to be 4 inches plus
1 inch for the seam allowance for a total of 5 inches.
4. Lay out your fabric and cut your fabric.
153
Chapter 8: Accessorize! Window Details That Dazzle

5. Using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, sew your fabric in a long tube with
the wrong side facing out.
Sew one end of the tieback.
6. Using a ruler, chopstick, or letter opener, push the fabric inside out so
the right side is showing.
7. Tuck a 1⁄2 inch of fabric on the open end in and hand tack it closed, or
use hot glue to seal the end.
8. Hand sew on two plastic or wood rings at the ends, or create your
knot or bow at the end.
9. Repeat for the second tieback and you’re done!
Traditional tiebacks
Just like window treatments, tiebacks can be traditional or a little funky. If
you have a traditional-looking window treatment, you may want to consider
these traditional tieback styles:
 Lined, shaped tiebacks: Used in more formal rooms, these tiebacks
are created with a pattern and feature a variety of shapes, such as cres-
cents, scallops, or round-edged rectangles. The tieback is often lined
with coarse, glue-stiffened buckram backing to keep its unusual shape.
 Plaited tiebacks: Plaiting is a way of braiding fabric or trim together so
they become as one. You can make this style by plaiting three pieces of
material together and sewing the ends. You can also make them with
ribbon, cord, or any other type of trim that pleases your eye.
 Ruffled tieback: Attached to a 1⁄2- or 1-inch strip of fabric, this type of
tieback often complements a ruffled window treatment.
154
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 
Don’t forget about holdbacks
Holdbacks are the “hard” version of tiebacks;
they’re usually made of iron, aluminum, and other
metals. Decorative hardware tiebacks can be a
durable and stylish alternative to fabric, espe-
cially when you have quite a lot of fabric, or a
particularly heavy fabric, to hold back. Some
look like large, decorative hooks and are called
loop style, while other styles may have projec-
tion arms that stick out from the wall with some
sort of motif at the end (a fleur-de-lis, a star, a
flower) where the fabric settles into place —
these are called knob-style holdbacks. (Check
out Chapter 4 for more info on hardware.)

You don’t have to use fabric for your tiebacks, even for traditional ones.
Consider these other materials:
 Chair tie: We really like using chair tie for creating tiebacks. Chair tie
(sometimes called chair tie tassel) is a trim that usually comes in 20- or
30-inch lengths and consists of decorative cord that features 3- or 4-inch-
long tassels at both ends.
 Matte colored cord: Cord is an easy way to create tiebacks. Decorative
cord comes in many colors and sizes, from 1⁄8-inch to an inch in diameter.
Go for the thickest cord you can find when your curtains or draperies
are made from heavier fabric.
 Rayon cord: Rayon cord tends to have a fancy, shiny finish that looks
great as a tieback for treatments made from silks, sateens, or any type of
shiny-finished fabrics.
 Rope: Consider making tiebacks from different varieties of rope to add a
more masculine feel. Crafts stores stock white rope, raffia, jute, sisal,
and other types of fibers.
We like it when the tieback materials match or complement the curtain rod’s
style, although they too can stand alone as distinctive design elements (see
Chapter 3).
Alternative tiebacks
Tiebacks need to function, and they need to look good doing so. That said,
you don’t always have to use store-bought fabric to do the job. Look around
your house. You may already have the material hanging around that you can
use, or you can visit a secondhand store, local thrift shop, or hardware store
with your eyes peeled for anything funky yet functional.
Although some may sound a little whimsical or kooky, consider this list of
alternative tiebacks that may just inspire a related idea:
 A necktie is the perfect length for making a tieback. Stitch two or even
three together for a wider tieback, or use a single one for a narrow style.
Pick them up cheap at a thrift store, garage sale, or flea market, or raid a
male relative’s closet.
 Colored ribbons work well. Just braid three different colored ribbons
together to create a simple rainbow-effect tieback.
 Rope is terrific for adding texture to a jungle- or organic-themed room.
Are you thinking of using a tropical print fabric for a window treatment
(perhaps for a child’s room or a bathroom)? Consider braiding three
pieces of rope together to make a sturdy tieback, one worthy of Tarzan.
155
Chapter 8: Accessorize! Window Details That Dazzle

You can use one or more tones or colors, but be sure to secure the ends
by sewing or hot gluing them all together.
 Premade fabric rosettes are feminine additions to any style. Pin, stitch,
or glue fabric rosettes from the crafts store in a line, from one end to the
other of your tiebacks. (Check out the “Rosettes” section earlier in this
chapter.)
 Fishnet can work wonders to complement your rooms with nautical or
fishing themes. You can buy fishnet fabric or cut up a pair of light-
colored fishnet stockings (look for the cheap ones made mostly of
cotton, with no or not too much stretch), and dye the material to com-
plement a dominant color in the curtain fabric.
 Bandannas or vintage lace handkerchiefs are perfect for rooms with vin-
tage styles.
 Inexpensive beaded necklaces or Mardi Gras beads make fun, festive
tiebacks, making for a really glamorous look for a boudoir window treat-
ment (if you’re lucky enough to have one!). Small metal findings at the
ends of necklaces make attaching your tiebacks to cup or other hooks
especially easy, too.
Similarly, choose an ethnic-themed necklace to complement an ethnic
design. Try jade or faux-jade for a Far East look, African bead work to
complement mud or kente cloth, and so on. If you can’t find two neck-
laces that match, buy beads and string your own using fishing line.
 Tinsel, garland, tiny metallic Christmas tree ball ornaments, or artificial
mistletoe sewn or glued to artificial vine from the crafts store all are
perfect for the holidays. Similarly, wire-edged ribbon — the kind of
ribbon you use to make big bows on holiday presents — makes great
tieback material. Just wrap the ribbon around your fabric and twist
the ends together, securing them behind the drapery fabric with a hook
or nail. Seek the widest and strongest ribbon you can find to ensure
that your tiebacks hold well.
 Seashells (look for the ones that wash ashore with the hole already in
them), acorns, sea glass, dried flowers, gumball machine charms, any-
thing that strikes your fancy, look great sewn onto any plain tieback.
 Crocheted yarn (or other materials, even fabric strips) can match any
dominant color in your fabric.
 Vinyl or faux leather belts offer an ultramodern style. Just snip a belt,
tuck the ends under for a finished look, and then seal using hot glue.
Attach little plastic hook eyes, or rings, to the belt ends with heavy-duty
thread, so you can attach them to the wall with cup hooks.
 Interwoven artificial flowers from a crafts store can match a floral motif
or spice up a plain-colored fabric treatment. As long as you stay in the
same color and flower families, you can’t go wrong. This look is a really
adorable for a little girl’s room.

Tassels: The Final Touch
Tassels consist of ornately looped and tied thread, yarn, or string, and they
add a festive, decorative touch to fabric creations.
Larger tassels look great hanging at the tops of your window treatments and
they’re also nice to add to your tiebacks, which we talk about in the
“Tweaking the Look with Tiebacks” section earlier in this chapter. You can
buy tassels in many colors and sizes at your fabric store, but you may also
want to consider making your own. It’s really easy!
If you want to make your own, start by choosing your tassel string, which
needs to be a thicker thread like embroidery thread or any yarn. (Don’t use
sewing thread because it’s too thin.) You can use different yarns or threads
for different looks. You can choose from fluffy or nubby (for a crafty look),
shiny or silky (to match a more formal fabric, such as taffeta, damask, doupi-
oni silk, or sateen), or smooth and matte (nice to complement a faux-suede
microfiber fabric like Ultrasuede). One spool of thread or skein of yarn is
plenty to make one tassel, and you may even be able to make two, depending
on the size of the tassel you need.
Gathering your supplies
To start creating your tassels, get these supplies:
 1 piece of cardboard, cut to size
For this project, we chose a piece of cardboard 6 x 2 inches to create a
tassel 6 inches long.
 1 spool or skein of decorative yarn or thread (enough for one to three
tassels)
 Scissors

From telephone to tieback
One of the cutest window treatments we ever
saw was a pair of curtains that hung in a small
city-apartment kitchen. They were made from
fabric that featured an all-over pattern of red,
white, and pink telephones, and the tiebacks
were constructed from the cord from an old
1960s-style pink princess telephone. The two
curly-cues at the end were snipped and sealed
with glue to create loops that provided a ring
from which to hang the tiebacks (from simple
cup hooks).

Making your tassels
To create your tassels, just follow these steps:
1. Wrap your yarn or thread around the longer side of the cardboard
about a hundred times (yes, we said 100 times).
You’re wrapping the thread into a 6-inch-long loop.
2. Cut a piece of yarn or thread about 10 inches long and slip it through
the loop formed by the wrapped yarn/thread at the top of your card-
board and then tie it in a tight knot (see Figure 8-4).
3. Cut the bottom of the tassel evenly along the bottom of the cardboard
(see Figure 8-4).
4. Cut a piece of yarn/thread that measures 3 feet (36 inches) long to
wrap tightly around the neck of the loop you tied and cut in Steps 2
and 3 as many times as it will go around.
Leave enough yarn/thread on the ends so you can tie them in another
knot (see Figure 8-5).
Hide the leftover ends of your yarn/thread in the fringe of the tassel and
make a loop at the top so you can hang your tassel.
5. Trim the bottom of the tassel so that the strands are even.
You’re done! Now add the tassel to the curtain at a top corner by thread-
ing the loop through your rod, or you can attach it to a curtain ring.
You can add it to the middle of your curtain to highlight your tieback by
threading the tieback through the tassel loop, and then situating the
tassel where you like.

You can adjust your tassel’s size by shortening or lengthening the cardboard.
The larger you go, the thicker the string or yarn you’ll want to try. Experiment
with thread or yarn that you already have at home.

Treatments
In This Chapter
 Fixing (or covering) your mistakes
 Taking shortcuts and making the best use of your time
S
o what happens when your exact measurements are a bit off or you acci-
dentally cut a hole in your window treatment fabric, but you don’t want
to or can’t afford to start over? No problem.
This chapter offers you a few ways to save the day. From too long to
too short, from crooked curtains to imperfections, we help you fix whatever
problem your window treatment may have. You may even make your creation
look better! In addition to quick fixes, we also offer a few timesaving tips to
keep you right on track.
No Fretting Over Those
Inevitable Mistakes
Even the most talented people who sew make mistakes. Before you throw
your fabric in the trash or have a neighborhood bonfire, try these few sugges-
tions to help fix whatever ails your creation.

Lengthening too-short curtains
or draperies
Did you measure your fabric twice, cut it, sew the hems, and then while hang-
ing your new curtains realize that they were too short for your window?
Breathe deeply. Don’t tear them down in disgust. We have the perfect solu-
tion for you.
Adding a contrasting fabric at the bottom of too-short curtains is a simple
way to get the length you want. It’s also an opportunity to give more panache
to your curtain or drapery. You can also consider sewing a print to the
bottom of a solid curtain for a bit of added style. For example, red-and-white
checked gingham sewn to a solid white, red, blue, or even yellow kitchen cur-
tain is attractive. You can also add a piece of wide eyelet lace to a curtain
bottom to get adequate length. To give your treatment a cohesive feel, con-
sider using a bit of the added fabric to create your tiebacks, too.
When adding fabric to the bottom of your treatment, follow these steps:
1. Remove the sewn hem using your seam ripper.
2. Measure to find the length of fabric that you need to add, allowing for
a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance on the existing treatment.
3. Add a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance and at least another 2 inches for a new
hem to the new fabric length to be added.
4. Cut out and then attach the new fabric at the bottom of your too-short
curtain or drapery using a straight stitch and a 1⁄2-inch seam
allowance.
5. Press your fabric, rehang it on your rod, and pin your new hem
(this time you’ll get it just right!).
6. Take the treatment down and stitch your hem.
If you’re adding a narrow trim or lace for just a bit of extra length, take your
hem out with a seam ripper, press it flat, and add the trim or lace with a
zigzag stitch to the bottom edge.
Shortening too-long curtains or draperies
If you don’t want to take your curtains down and re-hem them, consider drap-
ing your curtains through holdbacks or tiebacks in a different way to shorten
the total length:
162
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 

1. Attach your tiebacks somewhat higher than the center of your
window and a bit farther to the left and right than the outside frame.
2. Loop the fabric through the tiebacks, and then balloon the fabric over
the tiebacks, pulling the fabric down and toward the center of your
window.
The larger “poof” from the balloon effect picks up some fabric slack.
Check out the illustrations in Chapter 4 to get some other ideas for achieving
a fuller look with tiebacks.
Balancing uneven curtains or draperies
When hanging your curtains, you notice that one panel is longer than the
other. What do you do? You can take them down and resew them, of course.
If you don’t want to do all that extra work, consider something else. If your
treatment has a rod sleeve, you can use a tension rod to save the day. Thread
the tension rod through the rod sleeve and see if you can position the tension
rod so that the panel is even. Your tension rod will be slanted higher on one
side than the other and will look a bit funny, so you may want to whip up an
easy swag or valance to cover up the top of the treatment (see Chapters 7
and 14 to find out how to make swags and valances in a jiffy). That added top
part makes your window look even better. Wow, you’ve made something gor-
geous out of your mistake!
Using accessories to cover
holes, rips, or stains
Yikes, where did that hole come from? Instead of blaming yourself, take this
opportunity to add a bit of fun to your window with an added design detail,
such as appliqués, buttons, and bows. These problem solvers also work well
when you’re dealing with slightly damaged fabric you picked up inexpen-
sively, and which you knew you’d need to finesse to get a great-looking treat-
ment (see Chapter 2 for more on deciding when it’s right to pick up flawed
fabric).
When crafting your cover-up detail, make sure it looks like an intentional part
of the treatment and that you apply it creatively, proportionately, and equally.
The following points are also important to remember when covering holes,
rips, or stains:
163
Chapter 9: Quick Fixes and Timesaving Techniques for Window Treatments

 Be sure that the size of the detail matches the treatment’s proportion.
 Be sure to add the detail to each panel in generally the same area, even
those without any stains or holes, so the entire treatment maintains a
cohesive, balanced feel.
 Have fun deciding where to place your details. You could create lines,
zigzags, heart shapes, swirls, or any pattern that pleases you.
Always choose your design detail to match your decor and the “feel” of the
window treatment. For example, is the window treatment for a child’s room,
play room/den, or other informal room? Keep your design detail simple: bows
made from simple ribbon, buttons shaped like animals or in bright colors,
and the simplest appliqués. Is the treatment for a formal area, such as a
dining room, living room, or master bedroom? Use an ornate or embroidered
ribbon to create bows, or choose one-of-a-kind buttons or a line of beautiful
sequins to cover a rip or hole (check out Chapter 8 for more ideas).
Appliqués
Appliqués are decorative embellishments that you sew or glue in place. They,
can help cover a hole, rip, or stain in a window treatment, and appliqués are
easy to attach. Simply pin them in place or use a glue stick. Pick a thread that
matches the appliqué’s background and use a straight stitch all around the
border to sew it in place. You can use your machine or you can hand sew
them on.
You can buy appliqués at a fabric or crafts store or make them yourself. Cut
them out of nonraveling fabric like faux-suede or felt, or use a serger to finish
the edges of a homemade appliqué made from another type of fabric (see
Chapter 5 for more information on sergers).
If you’ve used a delicate fabric, such as silk or a sheer fabric like voile or
batiste, for your treatment and there’s a chance the rip, cut, or hole might rip
and extend farther out from underneath your appliqué, first mend the fabric
with a zigzag stitch before attaching your appliqué. The stitching doesn’t
have to look great, it just has to give your treatment a chance to “heal” under
the appliqué.
Buttons
Buttons are a great way to add weight to a curtain and add a fun, whimsical
feel. Sewing on buttons does take a bit of time but the effect is worthwhile.
Look for flat buttons that lie flush against the fabric; they can conceal flaws
better because they completely cover the flaws. Be sure to mend the fabric
underneath so that you have a smooth surface over which to sew the
button. Then add your button over the flaw, making sure to add some addi-
tional buttons elsewhere on the treatment so it looks like a design detail.
164
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 

A complimentary row of buttons along the bottom of your curtain or drapery
looks terrific and gives a homey, crafty look. For a child’s room or kitchen, try
a polka-dot pattern in a wide variety of sizes; it’s a great way for young chil-
dren to learn their colors and sizes.
To attach a button by hand, first mark the spot where you want it with a
piece of chalk or fabric marker. If you’re attaching a row of buttons, use a
ruler to space them evenly and to keep your row straight. Choose thread that
closely matches the button’s color, not the fabric underneath, and thread
your needle.
If you’re sewing a button that goes through a buttonhole, sew it with some
slack. If you’re sewing a decorative button, sew it as tightly to the fabric’s
face as possible. Go through the holes a few times and knot the thread on the
back of the panel so the threads don’t show.
Bows
Bows made of ribbon are another way to cover holes or flaws. Choose 
wire-edged ribbon to create bows with specially shaped loops. You can also
create bows from strips of fabric. Consider adding small Maltese crosses and
rosettes, as well (see Chapter 8 for more on these embellishments).
Paillettes
Paillettes, which are round, flat, and usually metallic-finished discs with tiny
holes at the top are another quick cover-up. (You can read all about them in
Chapter 8.) Because quite a few large, shiny paillettes go a long way style-
wise, you can get away with adding fewer, and you can save a buck or two.
Weighting curtains that
just won’t hang well
Sometimes the reason a curtain doesn’t hang well is its fabric is just too light
to acquire a shape. You can add weight to your curtains in a number of ways,
such as the following.
 You can sew heavy buttons to the bottom as a decorative touch.
 You can add a few curtain weights, which are available at crafts and
fabric stores. They’re tiny metal pellets wrapped in fabric that you sew
to the bottom.
If you want to save a little money, don’t buy the curtain weights. Just
open up a few stitches on your bottom hem, hot glue some pennies or
nickels inside the bottom hem of your curtain, and resew the hem.
165
Chapter 9: Quick Fixes and Timesaving Techniques for Window Treatments

Uniting panels that don’t “meet”
Sometimes, despite your greatest effort, the medium- or large-scale repeat
patterns don’t meet when you mount your treatment and draw the two
panels together. If this bothers you, you can try adding a solid fabric in a con-
trasting color to the center edges. Doing so adds another attractive design
detail to your room.

How to cover a multitude of sins
Okay, so you messed up. Crooked stitching, a
hole or two. Hey, it happens. Who says you can’t
turn the tables and use your mistake as a design
detail? Mistakes that are well covered are no
longer mistakes at all. (Moms with young chil-
dren, these tips work equally well to cover up
stains that don’t “magically disappear” like on
the TV detergent commercials.)
Here are a few great combinations to consider:
 Cafe, crisscross, or casement curtains look
lovely with fabric bows sprinkled around.
Use thin ribbon to make your bows and stitch
them in place all over your fabric’s face.
 Add some cut-felt fish, sharks, jellyfish,
anchors, boats, and sea plants to your kid’s
room curtains to cover up holes (or stains)
and add a bit of the ocean to the room. Other
great themes include the ABCs, dogs and
cats, and barnyard animals. Grab your pink-
ing shears to create “fur” on fabric crea-
tures (see Chapter 5 for more on pinking
shears). And button eyes are always a clas-
sic look. Create multisize polka dots, differ-
ent balls from various sports, or trucks and
cars (stencil kits are available at crafts and
fabric stores if you’re not artistically inclined).
 Add a few sequins to a simple leaf- or flower-
shaped appliqué for something truly elegant.
 Use a decorative trim, like rickrack, to
create “stripes,” either vertically or hori-
zontally, across the face of a treatment
panel. Arrange your stripes to cover a flaw
in your fabric’s grain or to cover the damage
done by a pair of wayward scissors. If your
sewing machine got a bit out of control and
your seams are a bit wavy, you can use
rickrack to cover them up, too.
 Patch squares of contrasting denim fabric
randomly on your panels to give a rustic,
country feel. You don’t have to finish the
edges because the frayed effect adds to the
look.
 Press on patches. Is your curtain stained,
but you just can’t bring yourself to do any
more sewing? Also available for all you no-
sew fans is iron-on fabric meant to be used
as knee and elbow patches for clothing. You
can cut it into different shapes and easily
press it on with an iron. 
 Use glitter glue. Another alternative is to
pick up some glitter glue and use it to create
a motif that fully covers the stain. Use a
marker to draw the border of the motif
around the stain, and then use it as a guide
to fill the area in with glitter glue. It dries
smooth and shiny; kids just love this stuff.

You can also add solid fabric in a contrasting color to your panels’ center
edges if you didn’t properly estimate the fabric fullness for the look you want.
Doing so creates a bit more width to your panels.
See the steps in “Lengthening too-short curtains or draperies” earlier in this
chapter to add fabric to the sides of your panels; it’s the same concept.
Taking Shortcuts That Nobody Notices
We believe that shortcuts don’t have to lead to shoddy or sloppy work. In
fact, you can make your life easier and still get an attractive end result. This
section includes a few ways to speed up your project-making time and maybe
even save a bit of frustration in the process.
Using trim to hide selvages
The selvages are the edges where the fabric comes off the looms, and they’re
usually cut away and discarded because they sometimes have writing on
them or they don’t conform to the look of the rest of the fabric. If you plan to
cover over them, this isn’t an issue so you don’t have to cut them away at all.
Covering over the selvage with trim is a great way to get a bit more width
from your fabric.
Keep in mind that each piece of fabric has a different size selvage. Make sure
the trim you choose is wide enough to cover the entire selvage.
You can attach your trim with hot glue, iron-on bonding tape like Stitch
Witchery, or another adhesive product designed for fabric use. To sew it in
place, stitch it securely onto your fabric along both edges using a thread
color that matches the trim. When using a sewing machine to attach trim,
work slowly and carefully using a straight stitch. The outer edge of your trim
needs to align exactly with the selvage’s edge. If you align it correctly, the
trim will blend with no crookedness with your fabric.
Ribbon is one of the best trim choices to cover your selvage because it cre-
ates a beautiful “frame” to your treatment fabric. Choose trim to add contrast
and pick up another color in your room’s decor. For an informal treatment,
choose a simple one-color trim, like grosgrain ribbon. For a more formal look,
choose satin ribbon, a flat braid or picot-edge braid, a short-skirted fringe, or
even a lace edging (make sure the lace’s design is opaque enough to cover
the selvage with no show-through).

Trying shower curtain rings and grommets
Shower curtain hooks are the metal or plastic rings that you usually use to
hang shower curtains. They come in many different designs — some plain
and modern, and some very ornate with a baroque feel — so you’re sure to
find a set that complements your window treatment. You can use them in
place of rings with clips if you create small holes at the top of your panel and
reinforce them with grommets, which are round metal rings that create sealed
holes in fabric and are easy to do.
Pick up a grommet kit at any crafts or fabric store; these kits include a special
grommet-setting tool. The grommets usually come eight to a kit and are avail-
able in many sizes, so pick one that looks good with your treatment — the
longer and wider the curtain or drapery, the larger the grommet. Most grom-
mets are silver or chrome color, but you may find gold tone, too.
Match your grommet size to your fabric thickness: The thicker the fabric, the
larger the grommet size. For a heavier fabric, you may need more than one
kit. You also need scissors, a good-quality hammer, and a secure work sur-
face. Then follow these easy steps:
1. Use a ruler to mark your grommet locations evenly across the top hem
of your fabric, adding a little dot or circle with a marker or tailor’s
chalk.
Choose the interval at which you space your grommets according to
your fabric’s weight. For a lightweight fabric, every 6 inches is fine. For
a heavyweight fabric, 3 or 4 inches may be better.
2. Turn your fabric wrong side up and place the grommet bottom
(see the directions in your kit to determine which one is the bottom
piece) over your mark, and hit it with the hammer so it cuts through
the fabric.
Doing so breaks through the fabric and creates a circle.
3. Remove the grommet bottom and trim away the little circle of fabric
that sits inside the grommet.
4. Restore the grommet bottom to the wrong side of the fabric and slip
it through the hole so that it peeks through to the right side of the
fabric.
5. Flip the fabric right side up with the grommet bottom in place.
6. Place the grommet top over the grommet bottom; your treatment
fabric will be sitting between them. 
168
Part II: Window Treatments in a Snap 

7. Using your grommet tool and your hammer, hammer the top and
bottom together.
8. Remove the grommet tool and check that the fit is secure.
If you need any clarifications, just check the directions on the package
provided by the grommet company.
To hang your treatment with grommets, you don’t necessarily need a rod and
rings. Consider attaching small hooks or even decorative nails directly to
your wall or window frame. Using a ruler or tape measure, measure the dis-
tance between each grommet and attach your nails or hooks accordingly.

Working smarter, not harder
Everyone loves shortcuts, and this section
includes a few of our favorites for window treat-
ments. Nobody notices these shortcuts after
you’re finished, and they make the job faster.
 Measure, cut, and iron all the folds and
creases out of your fabric before you begin
to sew. After you sit down at the sewing
machine, you can breeze through your
sewing and not waste time.
 Before you start to sew, hold the fabric up to
the window or drape it over your rod or pole
to double-check in the light that your fabric
has no flaws and that you haven’t made any
holes or unnecessary cuts in the fabric.
Doing this step also allows you to determine
if your length and width are adequate.
 If you find you have underestimated your
fabric and you don’t have enough fabric to
create a hem by folding fabric over and
stitching, consider using Stitch Witchery or
some other brand of iron-on bonding tape
at the bottom to create a slimmer hem.
 When creating your curtain or drapery’s rod
sleeve, instead of stitching, you can place
safety pins across the treatment, inserting
them from the wrong side. Be sure to use
many and space them evenly.
 Instead of sewing the edges and hems of
your fabric panel, you can use pinking
shears to edge your fabric and keep it from
fraying.
 If you don’t want to buy curtain hooks or
cup hooks to attach your tiebacks, just use
a small nail. Place it inside the tieback, push
it through the fabric, and just nail it into the
wall. The front of the tieback fabric hides
the nail.
 Tension rods are a great timesaver. To hang
a basic curtain, simply thread the tension
rod through the rod sleeve and adjust it
inside your window frame. You don’t have to
bother with drills and hammers, brackets,
nails, and rings. (See Chapter 4 for more on
tension rods.)
 Attach your trim with a hot glue gun instead
of sewing it on. Hot glue is a great way to
attach fabric to fabric, because it’s cheap,
fast, and fun. Apply small amounts as you
work and keep paper towels handy to dab
any excess.

O
ne of the most important parts of planning your slipcover project is
measuring your furniture correctly. You need to understand the differ-
ent parts of your slipcover and how they come together to make your slip-
cover properly, and measuring them is the beginning step in that
understanding.
You also need to know how to properly determine how much fabric you
need. Calculating your fabric needs informs your fabric choice in two ways:
available quantity and price. Finding the right fabric in the right amount
and within a budget you can live with are both crucial steps. (Check out
Chapter 6 for more info. Many of the same measuring and fabric preparation
concepts that we discuss there for window treatments are applicable to
slipcover making.)
In this chapter, you discover all about measuring, cutting, and constructing
your slipcover. We also give you advice on how to determine your total fabric
quantities, offer some fitting tips, and show you how to make an easy pattern
so you can make your slipcover right the first time.

Measuring Furniture and Cutting and
Sewing Fabric for Slipcovers
This section provides some valuable information when you begin measuring
your furniture and then when you pull out the scissors and needle and
thread. Keep these ideas in mind when you start thinking about making your
project.
Measuring tips
For each project in this book, we offer specific measuring instructions to
make your life as easy as possible. However, making correct measurements
for slipcovers can be tricky because slipcovers need so much fabric. The fol-
lowing list offers a few general tips to help you:
 Always allow for extra yardage, just in case you need it. Cutting off an
extra 1⁄2 or 3⁄4 yard of fabric is easier than having to go back to the fabric
store, locate your bolt, and buy more. In the worst-case scenario, your
bolt is gone, the fabric is no longer available from the manufacturer, and
you have to start all over again. You definitely don’t want that to happen!
Buy the little extra yardage. You can always use whatever you have left
over to cover a matching pillow, or to make a contrasting tieback for a
window treatment in the same room.
 When measuring unusually shaped furniture, measure at the largest
dimension both vertically and horizontally. If you have a sofa that
is wider on top than at the bottom, measuring along the widest part
can ensure you have adequate coverage. Be sure to add in your 1⁄2-inch
seam allowance on each edge (or 1 inch, if you prefer), and for “bottom”
pieces of your furniture that will be hemmed, be sure to add a 1- to 
11⁄2-inch allowance so you have plenty of fabric to construct your hem.
Always use a soft, cloth tape measure so you can correctly gauge the
wraparound sections of your furniture, and to tuck into your sofa’s or
chair’s crevices for tuck-ins, if necessary (see “Calculating Seam
Allowance, Hem Allowance, and Tuck-ins” for more info). A metal tape
measure doesn’t account for the “give” you need for slipcovers.
Cutting and sewing tips
The biggest sewing challenge you face when making slipcovers is how to
manage the large amount of fabric you have to maneuver through the sewing
machine. These few tips can help:
174
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

 Place your sewing machine on a large worktable so you can spread out
the fabric, or have a card table adjacent to your sewing machine so your
sewn fabric has a safe landing spot.
 Work slowly and surely. Guide your fabric through the sewing machine
at an even pace and stop periodically to make sure your sewn lines are
straight. Taking these simple steps can help you to manage large pieces
of fabric.
 Sew your longest seams first because they have the most pins in the
fabric. That way your pins don’t stick into adjacent pieces of fabric and
slow you down as you work.
If you’re using a print fabric whenever you have to join fabric panels to create
enough width to cover a larger piece of furniture, make sure you cut your
fabric on grain. Laying out your fabric and cutting it on grain means making
sure that the lengthwise grain (imagine a line through your fabric that you
want to be perpendicular to the floor), or grainline, of your pattern is parallel
to the selvage edges (the edges where the fabric comes off the loom, where
writing sometimes appears). See Chapter 6 for more info.
Construction tips
In the slipcover projects in this book, we often refer to a “standard”- size sofa,
armchair, and dining room chair. Of course, this classification is arbitrary,
one that’s really based on Mark’s furniture at home, which isn’t too big and
not too small. Our standard sofa measures 87 inches wide x 37 inches 
high x 30 inches deep (from front to back), our armchair measures 30 inches
wide x 37 inches high, and our dining room chair measures 33 inches high,
14 inches wide, and a seat with a 20-inch diameter. Yours may be bigger or
smaller, but adjusting the measurements accordingly is easy.
175
Chapter 10: Calculating, Measuring, and More: General Tips for Slipcovering
Paying attention to margins
One of the best time and frustration savers is
planning your margins before you cut and sew
your fabric. Fabric margins are the seam and
hem allowances around the edges of your mea-
sured project. When you’re making a pattern or
measuring your fabric panel, remember to
always add in the correct amount for your pro-
ject. For example, if you want a large hem on the
bottom of your curtain, say 4 inches, add a 
4-inch hem allowance to your curtain length
measurement, and then add a small turn-under
allowance too. If you decide you want some
weight at the bottom of your curtains, to make
them look more substantial and to allow them to
hang better, having planned your margins cor-
rectly will allow for it.

Keep these important concepts in mind when constructing your slipcover:
 The standard seam allowance for slipcovers is a 1⁄2-inch, but feel free
to increase it to 1 inch. If you want to give your slipcover a bit more
wiggle room (in case you want to change your seam allowance to fix a
too-tight fit), you can work with a 1-inch seam allowance. You can always
trim off the fabric later if you find that it adds too much bulk, but it’s
better to be safe than sorry, as our moms always said.
 Be aware that your fabric choice is one of the biggest determining fac-
tors in how easy or difficult the construction of your slipcover will be.
Your fabric’s pattern has to go in the same direction all over your sofa,
loveseat, dining room table, or chair. If you choose a large print or stripe,
the motif has to be consistent over the back, arms, cushions, and sides,
which can be a real challenge to plan well. If you choose a large print or
stripe, you also need a lot more fabric, too.
If you don’t feel confident that you can match stripes or large prints
across panels, stick with solids or petite prints for your first slipcover.
Check out our discussion on pattern repeats in Chapter 6.
 Seek out a fabric with what we call great drapability (fabric that is
very pliable, not too stiff, and which molds well to your furniture).
If you’re treating a sofa with a lot of curves — say, a camel-back sofa —
opting for a fabric that drapes well and seemingly molds to the rounded
back or curved arms of your furniture helps ensure you’ll create a slip-
cover that conforms and flatters.
 Sofa slipcovers can benefit from railroading fabric. Railroading is a
way of using fabric so that the lengthwise grain runs horizontally — with
176
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 
The art of pinning and chalking
We recommend that you always pin your fabric
so that the pin is perpendicular to the fabric edge,
with the pointy tip facing left and the head to the
right, toward the cut edge. This way, while you’re
sewing, you can remove the pins as you stitch.
However, if you’re pinning to fit on the furniture,
you need to put the pins in lengthwise, along the
seam line, to get a good fit. Put them in so the
seam allowance is to the right of the pins, with
the heads going down and the points up. This way
you can pull them out when you come to them.
Most slipcover books recommend that you use
T-shaped pins to attach pieces of fabric to your
furniture. You can, but safety pins work just as
well. Use them to attach muslin or patterns to
your furniture, because they’re less prone to slip
than straight pins. You can also use masking
tape or any other kind of tape that adheres well
but doesn’t harm your furniture or fabric.
After you pin your fabric in place, you’ll be draw-
ing a line in chalk to show seam allowances and
where to cut. You have a few choices when it
comes to tailor’s chalk, which comes in yellow,
red, and black (besides white). If you’re work-
ing on a light-color fabric, you can choose a
darker chalk so it shows up well.

selvage edges parallel to the floor — as opposed to vertically, where the
selvages run perpendicular. The advantage of railroading is that you can
cover a wide expanse and avoid having to worry about seam place-
ments, which is very useful when creating a sofa slipcover, and you save
a bit of money because you don’t need as much fabric. Solid fabrics,
petite prints, or prints that can be turned sideways, such as a stripe or
an even check, are all good candidates for railroading.
Some fabrics can’t be railroaded. These include fabrics with uneven
plaids or stripes, fabrics with a one-way design, and fabrics that have a
nap (see the sidebar, “Taking a nap [into consideration]”).
 Plan your seam placement on your slipcover if you can’t railroad the
fabric. If you don’t railroad your fabric, you have to join fabric panels to
create adequate width for your slipcover. Plan your seam placement
before you begin. You don’t want to have a seam going down the middle
of your sofa. Instead, place a full width of fabric in the middle of your
sofa and plan to place a narrower panel on each side of it.
If you’re working on a sofa with cushions, you can align the seams to
where the cushions meet each other so the seams “disappear” into
the seat.
 Cut your large pieces first and your small pieces last. If you run out of
fabric and have to go back to the store for more, you have a better
chance of picking up an extra 3 yards for a smaller pattern piece, as
opposed to 5 or 6 for a large one.
 When it’s time to transfer measurements to your fabric, always use
your L-square to create right angles. Doing so helps your slipcover’s
edges be perfect squares and look sharp and clean.
 Fit your slipcover on your furniture as you sew pieces to pieces to
obtain a good fit. This point is especially important with unusually
shaped and T-back sofas. If you’re unsure at any step whether you calcu-
lated correctly, put the slipcover back on the furniture to check for fit.
(Sorry for all that stair climbing if your sewing machine and your furni-
ture are on different floors!)
If you break your furniture down piece by piece, even the unusual
shapes are easy to slipcover. For example, circular ottomans aren’t that
much harder to cover than square or rectangular shapes. Make a pattern
for the piece in the shape of a circle, and the bottom section is really
just a long rectangle. For this part, just measure the ottoman’s circum-
ference and add an inch for the seam allowance.
 Feel free to leave your side seams open while creating your slipcover,
so as to allow for tapering the fit to conform to the furniture’s shape.
If you think your wingback armchair, T-back sofa, or loveseat would
benefit from tapering, pin the fabric in place and chalk mark where the
fabric needs to close, either by sewing or inserting a zipper or other
closing device (for more on this subject, check out “Getting some clo-
sure” later in this chapter).
177
Chapter 10: Calculating, Measuring, and More: General Tips for Slipcovering

 Press your seams flat before you put your slipcover on. Seams that
stick up in an unruly fashion add bulk and will make a slipcover appear
to fit poorly. To see if you’ve achieved a great fit, be sure your seams are
as flat as they can be.
 To remove bulk so that your slipcover lays properly, trim off the
excess fabric underneath after your sewing is complete. If you worked
with a 1-inch seam allowance, you can trim it down to a 1⁄2-inch. Snip
your corners on the diagonal to remove bulk there, too.
Calculating Fabric Needs Based on
Your Furniture’s Measurements
You’ve measured your furniture and now you’re ready to buy the fabric. You
can rely on the following sources to help you calculate your fabric needs
correctly.
 Fabric stores: Stores that stock an array of home decorator fabrics usu-
ally have a chart of typical yardage needed for common types of furni-
ture. Write your furniture dimensions down in your notebook — making
sure to record the width, length, and depth — and bring a picture or
sketch with you to the store. (Check out Chapter 2, where we discuss
the importance of keeping all your design preferences and information
in a notebook.)
 Online: Many upholstery fabric vendors keep a furniture chart (which
is just a chart with typical types of furniture to be slipcovered), but if
you plan to shop for fabric at an outlet, it pays to go there prepared. For
an amazing resource to help you determine how much fabric you need
for any slipcover, go to www.joyceupholstery.com and click on
178
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 
Taking a nap (into consideration)
A fabric that has a fluffy or fuzzy texture (such
as velvet, corduroy, or velveteen) has a nap.
When you run your hand over “with nap” fabric,
you can change the color from light to dark,
depending on which direction the raised texture
goes. If you sew a panel of fabric where the nap
is running down to one where the nap is running
up, you’ll have a two-tone slipcover, which
wouldn’t look right. When you calculate your
fabric amount, keep in mind that you can’t turn
a pattern piece on its side to fit onto a length of
yardage to save some fabric, say by squeezing
an armrest cut next to a side cut. The bottom
of each pattern piece must face the same end
of the fabric. Then when joining your pieces
together at the sewing machine, remember
again that your fabric must always face in the
same direction. Before you cut, make sure each
piece is smooth when you run your hand over it.
Does the color stay even? You’re doing fine.

“Yardage Chart.” Dozens of furniture types are included, with the appro-
priate yardage amount beneath. Find the image closest to the piece of
furniture you intend to cover and print it out, and then keep it with you
in your notebook.
 Yourself: If you prefer, calculate your fabric needs at home and confirm
the amount with the fabric vendor. In order to calculate how much fabric
you need for your slipcover, measure across and over your furniture and
add all the yardage together (keep reading this section for the specifics).
Gathering the supplies
If you decide to measure your own furniture, you need the following supplies
on hand:
 Soft cloth measuring tape
 Notebook
 Pencil
Taking the measurements
When measuring your furniture, follow these easy steps:
1. Move your piece of furniture to a place in the room where you have
total clearance on all sides, which helps get accurate measurements.
To create your future slipcover, get to know your furniture a bit better.
Make a sketch of each piece of furniture you plan to cover from different
viewpoints. Doing so helps you keep track of measurements and gives
you a context that makes understanding how the pieces fit together a
whole lot easier. If you’re artistically disinclined, use your camera.
2. Measure your piece of furniture by placing your tape measure at the
front on the floor.
Measure from the floor, up and over the seat, up the back, and over and
down the back to the floor again. Doing so determines the length. You’ll
be multiplying this figure by the number of fabric widths you need,
which we explain next.
3. Starting at the widest part of the furniture, measure from the right
side on the floor up, over the armrests and down to the seat, then
over the seat to the opposite armrest, up and over, then and back
down to the floor on the right side, and divide this measurement by
the width of fabric you’re using.
For example, if your furniture width is 90 inches and you’re using 
45-inch-wide fabric, then you need two widths.
179
Chapter 10: Calculating, Measuring, and More: General Tips for Slipcovering

4. Multiply the number of widths needed by your length measurement.
Suppose your length is 140 inches, so 140 inches multiplied by 2 is 280.
5. Divide that figure by 36 (because 1 yard equals 36 inches), and this is
your basic yardage. 
Add in an extra 2 yards to be on the safe side.
So, 280 divided by 36 is 7.7 (round up to 8) + 2 = 10 yards of 45-inch
wide fabric.
Many people push their sofas, loveseats, and chairs against walls. When
measuring your piece of furniture, be sure to move it away from the wall and
measure the outside back area to take into account the fabric you’ll need.
This point may seem obvious, but you’d be surprised how many times “out of
sight, out of mind” has lead to unfortunate trips back (no pun intended) to
the fabric store.
Measure your cushion’s circumference, length, and width and add additional
yardage to cover them, as well. You can find out how to do this in each spe-
cific project. If you intend to add a separate sofa skirt (see Chapter 17 for an
example of a sofa skirt you can add), add that, too. Use the same method for
measuring tables, dining room chairs, and ottomans.
Calculating Seam Allowance,
Hem Allowance, and Tuck-ins
After you have your measurements, you need to add a seam allowance to
each edge that is sewn to another piece. A seam allowance simply is the
amount of extra fabric you add to your measurement so you can join panels
together. Add 1 inch to accommodate two 1⁄2-inch seam allowances (on oppo-
site edges of the piece, to both the width and length measurements). If you
prefer to work with a 1-inch seam allowance, add 2 inches.
Meanwhile, hem allowance, the amount of extra fabric you add to create
hems, is usually 1 inch for lightweight or mediumweight fabrics, but can be
11⁄2 inches for heavier fabrics because the extra weight helps the fabric hang
properly. Make sure you add it to pieces that make up your slipcover’s
bottom. Add the hem allowance if you plan to finish your slipcover’s bottom
without a decorative trim. If you intend to trim your slipcover’s bottom, you
don’t need to create a hem. Just use your pinking shears along the edges to
keep the fabric from fraying (be sure to launder your slipcover gently), and
then just sew or hot glue your trim over the edge.
We design many of the sofa/loveseat/armchair slipcover projects in this
book so that the furniture’s cushions are covered separately and are placed
180
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

over the slipcover. If you choose to adapt a project so that the cushions are
hidden away under the slipcover, you need to allow for a tuck-in allowance.
The tuck-in is the area that tucks into the crevices where the inside arm and
inside seatback meet the seat (where all the lint, change, and cereal wind up).
Take your cloth tape measure and literally tuck it into the crevices. When
calculating a tuck-in area, you usually add an extra 21⁄2 to 3 inches per area.
Making Patterns
You can go to the store and buy a slipcover pattern that loosely conforms to
the dimensions of your piece of furniture, but making your own pattern allows
you to get your slipcover’s curves, contours, width, and length just right.
If you decide to make your own patterns, you have several different options.
You can make them from the following:
 Pattern-making paper, plain butcher’s paper, or even grid paper:
These papers are either plain paper or paper with one-inch dots. You
can use them to cut out your pieces in fabric. (See Chapter 5 for a dis-
cussion on these materials.)
 Muslin: Sometimes using muslin, an inexpensive pattern-making fabric,
is easier and more practical than using paper to create patterns, as is
the case with furniture that has curves and rounded edges. You simply
cut your pieces in muslin and sew a slipcover in that inexpensive fabric
to see if your slipcover has any flaws. Each piece of furniture is different,
and finding the hard-to-fit areas before you sew with your expensive
fabric is important.
Muslin is a terrific fabric for slipcover planning. You can drape muslin to
mimic your real fabric, pin it, mark it, take it apart, and use it to calcu-
late your actual yardage, and even use it as an actual pattern for creating
your slipcover.
Creating paper patterns
Most sofa parts are squares and rectangles. The best way to create a paper
pattern for those parts is to measure each part and then transfer those
measurements onto butcher’s paper using an L-square or ruler to keep your
edges straight. Don’t forget to add in your seam allowance as well.
Use grid paper (sometimes called graph paper) at a crafts store or pattern-
making paper at a sewing store to make the job even easier. They both have
1-inch measurements and straight lines that can help you transfer your mea-
surements perfectly. Then just label each piece and cut it out.
181
Chapter 10: Calculating, Measuring, and More: General Tips for Slipcovering

Another way is to trace the different shapes on your armchair, loveseat, or
sofa. This information is useful if you have curved areas, like a round seat.
Measure the longest and widest parts, and then cut a piece to those dimen-
sions in muslin and pin it to the part of the furniture that you’re making a pat-
tern for. With a pencil, trace around where you want your seam and remove
the muslin. Add a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance all the way around and you have a
permanent pattern you can use in the future.
Making a muslin pattern
Patience is essential when creating your own muslin pattern. Although
making a muslin pattern takes a bit of time and concentration, after you
master it, you have the key to creating an amazing slipcover. You can use
that pattern over and over again, whenever you feel like making a slipcover
change. This project looks like several steps, but don’t worry. We simply
break it down to make it as easy as possible.
Because your furniture is already slipcovered with its original fabric, you’re
halfway there to understanding how to make a slipcover. For this example we
use an armchair, and we work right on the chair. Wherever the chair has
seams, you need to make seams for your slipcover. 
When you visit the fabric store, buy more muslin than you think you’ll need,
even as much as one-third more. Muslin is cheap so you can overestimate
without any serious financial damage. Buy unbleached muslin, if you can. It’s
darker than bleached muslin so your chalk marks show up more clearly, and
we think unbleached muslin is a bit better for the environment.
We’re using a 30 x 37-inch armchair as our prototype. It has a boxy shape, so
its parts are easy to measure and draw. After you get the hang of measuring,
curved shapes should be easy, too.
Grabbing your gear
Before you start, make sure you have the following materials at the ready:
 Muslin yardage
Pick a width that is similar to the fabric you’ll use to create your slipcover.
 Cloth tape measure
 Fabric marker
 Scissors
 Straight pins or safety pins
 Tailor’s chalk
 Ruler or L-square (optional)

Making the pattern
Follow these easy steps when making your muslin pattern. (Don’t get discour-
aged if you think this list is too long. Just take one step at a time and you’ll be
done in no time.)
1. Take off the chair’s cushion; you’ll work on that later.
2. Starting with the outside back of your chair, measure the width and
length.
You decide how your slipcover will look: If you want the slipcover to go
all the way to the floor, measure to the floor.
3. Add 4 inches to your width and length measurements and cut your
muslin piece.
This extra amount allows adequate muslin to create your seam
allowance.
4. Pin it to the back of the chair with your straight pins, or you can use
safety pins.
5. Grab your tailor’s chalk and carefully follow the seams that are
already on your armchair (on the original upholstery), tracing lines
with your chalk right on your pinned muslin.
Make sure your lines are straight; use your ruler or L-square if that helps
you (see Figure 10-1).
6. Remove the muslin and using your fabric marker and ruler, draw
another line, which should be a 1⁄2-inch to the right from the chalk line
that you traced in Step 3 (see Figure 10-2).
This mark is the cutting line and reflects your 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
7. With your scissors, cut the muslin piece out using the second line you
drew in marker in Step 5.
You’ve created your muslin piece for the back of your chair. With your
fabric marker, write on the back: “Back, Cut 1.”

8. Measure your chair’s side.
Follow the same instructions in Steps 1 through 5 and use Figure 10-3
as a visual guide. Add 4 inches to each measurement, measure and pin
the muslin to the chair, chalk around the seams to get the shape, add
your 1⁄2-inch seam allowance in fabric marker, and cut out your piece.
This piece is your side pattern; mark it “Side, Cut 2, reversing one.” To
get a mirrored pair of sidepieces, you must flip the pattern over when
you cut the second piece unless your pattern piece is truly rectilinear.
9. For the inside seat area (which we sometimes call the seatback, the
backrest, or the area above the seat cushion), measure from the
bottom of the seatback up and over the top of the chair, to the back
area (where you made your first pattern in Step 2) and be sure to
add 4 inches to each measurement; see Figure 10-4.

10. Chalk a line on the top where the fabric bends back to meet the chair
back pattern.
Pin, chalk, remove your muslin, add a 1⁄2-inch seam-allowance line around
your chalk marks using your fabric marker, label it “Seatback, Cut 1,”
and cut out your pattern.
11. For the inside armrest area, you have to go over the top to meet
your side pattern, and make sure to chalk a line at the bend
(see Figure 10-5).
Pin, chalk, remove, add your 1⁄2-inch seam-allowance line, cut out your
pattern, and label it “Inside arm rest, Cut 2, reversing one.”
12. Create your seat pattern.
This area includes the part of the chair where the cushion will be set
down. Start at the crease where the seat meets the seatback and go
down to the floor in front of the chair (see Figure 10-6). Repeat the steps
as previously to create your muslin pattern, and label it “Seat, Cut 1.”

13. Finally, you have to create a pattern for the front of the armrests.
Repeat all the previous steps to create your muslin pattern, and label it
“Front armrest, Cut 2, reversing one.” Take a look at Figure 10-7 to see
how your armrest front patterns should look.
14. You also need to cover your seat cushion.
This cushion cover looks like a tube, and it’s easy to make. To make the
first pattern:
1. Measure the cushion’s width and the circumference (because
we’re creating a tube, the circumference measurement stands in for
the length) and add a 1⁄2-inch to each measurement. Create your
pattern in muslin and label it “Cushion top, Cut 1.”
2. Measure the cushion’s front and back. If your cushion is square,
these measurements are equal. Add a 1⁄2-inch to each measurement.
Create your pattern and label it “Cushion sides, Cut 2.”
If your cushion is irregular in shape, you can still follow these
instructions for making a cushion pattern, just follow the concept.
See Figure 10-8 for guidance.

15. Now that all your muslin pieces are cut, pin them together working
right on the armchair.
A 1⁄2-inch in from the cut edge of the muslin fabric is where the pieces
need to join. Use straight pins, or safety pins, the latter for more hold.
16. After you pin your muslin, remove the muslin and, using a baste
stitch, start sewing your pieces together, making sure to check the
“slipcover” as you sew every few seams to make sure the fit is correct.
Your muslin “slipcover” should look quite a lot like Figure 10-9.
17. Hem the bottom of your muslin “slipcover” to make sure you have the
hem allowance correct.

18. For your cushion, sew the two ends of the long piece of muslin into a
tube (see Figure 10-10).
19. Starting at the corner, pin in one rectangular piece of muslin into the
open area, or the tube’s “mouth,” and stitch it in using a 1⁄2-inch seam
allowance.
Stitch only one long seam on the other side so you can insert your cush-
ion to check for the fit.
Creating a rub-off pattern
In this section we offer you the option of creating a rub-off pattern. (A rub-off
pattern’s concept is identical to intaglio: You rub chalk on a raised surface to
create the pattern.) You can make this simple and effective pattern with pins
and chalk.
Getting your stuff
 A few yards of muslin, enough to create all the pieces of your slipcover
 Tailor’s chalk
 Fabric marker
 Safety pins
 Scissors
 Straight pins
Making your rub-off pattern
These easy steps help you create your own rub-off pattern.
1. Place the straight pins vertically along your furniture’s seams, insert-
ing them right along the seam line.
2. Using the piece designations set forth in the “Making a muslin pat-
tern” section earlier in this chapter, cut pieces of muslin large enough
to cover the area for which you’re creating a pattern.

3. Smooth and secure your muslin over one furniture area at a time,
using straight pins or safety pins, if you prefer.
4. With tailor’s chalk, rub over the straight pins that were added in place
along the furniture’s seams.
You’ll see an outline forming on the muslin.
5. Remove the muslin and add a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance along the out-
side of the chalk marks, using your fabric marker.
6. Cut out your pattern using the fabric marker lines as your guide and
you have an easy pattern piece.
Use it to create pieces in “real” fabric, which you sew together to make
your slipcover.
Fitting Tips
If you find that your slipcover doesn’t fit as perfectly as you’d hoped for, or if
it’s doing a slip and slide when certain members of your family hop or jump
on it, consider using a few of these tips.
Using ties
Adding ties to the underside of a slipcover can help secure it. Attach two
adjacent ties to the underside of your slipcover so that you can tie them
underneath the furniture’s legs. Place your slipcover on your furniture, get
down on the floor, and mark the area where you need to sew with a pin
or chalk.
You can sew your tie from fabric or use strong cord or twill tape. Each side
of the tie needs to be about 6 inches long and about an inch wide.
Adding Lycra in unseen areas
Adding a fabric made with Lycra, a wonderful synthetic stretch material, is
like putting a giant rubber band around your slipcover. It helps your slip-
cover slide on and off and conform to your sofa or chair beneath. Consider
adding some Lycra in the center back of your slipcover, or in other unseen
areas, to gain a better fit. If you can find one that matches your slipcover in
color, you’re really in luck! You can replace one panel in the back area with
Lycra, sewn to your other panels as you would any fabric.
189
Chapter 10: Calculating, Measuring, and More: General Tips for Slipcovering

Getting some closure
You can add zippers and other closing devices to cushions, or to the back
corners of sofas or chairs to allow for a better fit, especially if your sofa,
loveseat, or armchair is wider on top than at the bottom. Adding a bit more
seam allowance along seams that will be treated with closing devices is
helpful, so add a minimum of an extra 1⁄2-inch more when you’re planning
your pieces.
Zippers
We recommend using a back corner seam if you want to add a zipper. When
adding a zipper, extend it from just below the top of the slipcover down to a
1⁄2-inch above the bottom edge. Put your slipcover back on the sofa or chair
inside out. Measure your zipper by pulling the open seams together and pin-
ning the end of the measuring tape to the top of the open area. Then measure
down the length of the seam to a 1⁄2-inch from the slipcover’s bottom. For
information on adding a zipper, see Chapter 17.
Snaps or Velcro
If zippers aren’t your thing, you can add a few snaps, or even pick up some
snap tape, which is just snaps sewn onto a strip of fabric. You can even use
Velcro to secure your slipcover. If you plan to treat this area with snaps or
Velcro, plan your fabric allowance, so that one side overlaps the other. Take
this overlap into consideration when you’re creating your patterns.
Ribbons and grommets
Another creative way to close up the flaps at the sides or back of a sofa slip-
cover is to lace them together with a pretty decorative ribbon that run
through grommets. (Read all about applying grommets to fabric in Chapter 8.)
Frogs (but no toads)
Another way to secure your slipcover is adding frogs, which are two-piece
decorative cord closing devices that you sew on the slipcover’s face. Place
your slipcover back on the furniture and close the frog so the two pieces are
joined as one. Pin the frog on so that it closes the fabric, and then attach
the frog to the fabric by hand or with a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine.
If this unique closing device fits your decor, be sure to mirror them on
each side.

f you want to spruce up some furniture for a party, redecorate to celebrate
a holiday, or give your furniture a new look, simple slipcovers are the most
cost-efficient way to change any room’s look and feel without breaking your
budget. All you need is the gumption, some fabric, a few simple accessories,
and an afternoon to alter your furniture’s appearance.
Similar to Chapter 7 where we discuss easy no-sew window treatments, this
chapter focuses on easy no-sew and low-sew slipcovers. We try to keep your
time in front of the sewing machine to a minimum for the projects in this
chapter, and that time is spent sewing easy straight seams. You may also con-
sider using these quick alternatives: a hot glue gun and iron-on bonding tape
for creating simple hems.
Just because a slipcover is simple doesn’t mean that it’s unsophisticated or
shoddy. With the right fabric, simple slipcovers can work with any decor;
they can be informal, eclectic, casual, creative, and elegant.
This chapter focuses specifically on projects that you create with draping,
tucking, and tying the fabric in place, or securing it with hot glue, and then
embellishing with trim. So pick up some great fabric (see Chapter 2 for our
slipcover-specific recommendations), pull out your good scissors, iron, and
glue gun, and get ready. With just a bit of work and a dash of creativity, you
can beautifully slipcover almost any piece of furniture in your home.

Slipcovering a Loveseat or Sofa
Many loveseats are notorious for being, shall we say, aesthetically challenged.
Something about their smaller proportions — or maybe it’s the mushy word
“love” — influences manufacturers to cover loveseats in cutesy, annoying fab-
rics. However, you don’t need to throw out a too-cute loveseat, especially
because its smaller size makes it a wonderful candidate for trying out a
draped-fabric slipcover. In fact, a loveseat can be a great starting point to test
your skills.
You can apply this project to a sofa or loveseat of any size. For best results,
try using a solid fabric or a fabric with a small-scale all-over (nondirectional)
print. That way each area of the sofa matches the other, and you don’t have
one-way prints going the wrong way. (See Chapters 2 and 10 for more hints
about picking fabrics for slipcovers.)
Figuring out how much fabric you need
With this project you can easily adjust the fabric dimensions to fit your own
piece of furniture. We start with a standard-size loveseat. If you have a sofa,
don’t worry; the measuring techniques work just as well.
To figure out how much fabric you need when covering your loveseat or sofa
using the tucked-and-pinned technique, you need to measure two different
dimensions:
1. Start at the floor in the back, and go up and over the sofa and across
the cushions to the floor in the front.
This measurement gives you the length. Ours was 108 inches, which
converts to 3 yards.
2. Next work on the side measurements, starting on the floor and mea-
suring up and over one arm, across the sofa’s seat cushions to the
other arm, and then over that arm and back down to the floor.
This measurement gives you the width, which determines how many
lengths of fabric you need. For a medium or larger sofa, you probably
need at least three lengths to cover the sofa from arm to arm. A loveseat
may need only two. Our width measured about 175 inches, so we needed
three 3-yard lengths of 60-inch-wide fabric for a total of 9 yards. If the
fabric is 45-inches wide, use four 3-yard pieces for a total of 12 yards of
fabric. For more on converting fabric widths, see the Cheat Sheet in the
front of this book, where we include a Yardage Conversion Table.
192
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

If you need to join fabric panels together to get enough width for your sofa or
loveseat, take a look at our discussion on seam placement in Chapter 10.
Thinking about where your seams will go on your furniture before you start
cutting and joining fabric can make your job a lot easier.
If you have square or rectangular cushions that would be easy to cover with
our gift-wrapping method, you may decide to cover your cushions separately
(instead of having them sit underneath the slipcover); if so, be sure to remove
your cushions when making your yardage estimates. (Be sure also to check
out our discussion on tuck-ins in Chapter 10, the slipcover-measuring chap-
ter.) Then you need l1⁄2 yards of extra fabric to cover a standard-size sofa cush-
ion; if your sofa has three cushions, for example, you need 41⁄2 yards. If you
have round or unusually shaped cushions that will be hard to wrap, we sug-
gest you work over them.
Assembling your supplies
Before you make this slipcover, assemble the following supplies:
 The proper amount of fabric, based on your measurements
(Refer to the previous section, “Figuring out how much fabric you
need.”) For the loveseat we used, the total yardage was 12.
 Cloth measuring tape
 Iron and ironing board
193
Chapter 11: Tackling the Easy Stuff: Simple Slipcovers
Prints versus solid fabrics
When choosing fabrics for slipcovers, take a
moment and ponder before you select. Solid-
color fabrics are better than print fabrics
because the solid colors seem to disappear into
the sofa, making your job much easier because
you don’t have to match an arm to a sofa back.
Furthermore, you can always add some deco-
ration — embellishments or trim — after you’ve
made the cover to add the visual interest a print
would provide.
If you really have your heart set on using a print
fabric, be sure to choose one that has an all-
over, nondirectional motif; otherwise, you may
end up having a design running up, down, or
crossways across your sofa or loveseat.
Avoid plaids and other busy designs because
they’re difficult to match. The finished result
probably won’t be restful or pleasant to look at,
because the directions of the different pieces of
fabric go every which way over your furniture. 

 A box of 2-inch safety pins
 Scissors
 A box of straight pins
 Decorative trim (optional; see our advice in the “Measuring and attach-
ing decorative trim” section later in this chapter)
You add this trim along the bottom hem of your slipcover. Total yardage
depends on your loveseat or sofa. For ours, we needed 7 to 8 yards.
 Sewing machine (optional; if you want to sew)
 Iron-on bonding tape like Stitch Witchery (optional; if you don’t want
to sew)
 Upholstery locks (tiny screwlike devices that hold fabric in place;
optional)
Getting down to business
The fast and easy way to create a slipcover means working directly on the
loveseat or sofa when cutting and trimming. Draping your fabric over your
furniture and working with it that way ensures a proper fit. Follow these easy
steps and you can’t go wrong:
1. Iron all your fabric well, because you want it to drape easily and
smoothly over the loveseat or sofa.
2. If you intend to cover them separately, remove the cushions from the
loveseat or sofa.
3. Drape the fabric over the loveseat or sofa and tuck the fabric into the
cracks and crevices where the back meets the seat and on the sides
where the arms meet the seats.
4. Replace the not-yet-covered cushions on the loveseat or sofa to settle
the fabric into place.
Check again to ensure that all the fabric is tucked in evenly.
If you sewed three panels of fabric together to create one wide panel of
fabric, check to see whether the seams (along the seatback of the sofa
or loveseat) look straight and are well placed (see Figure 11-1). Your
seam placement needs to provide even amounts of fabric on either side.
For more on placing seams, see Chapter 10.
194
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

5. Add a few upholstery locks in discreet areas where nobody can see
them, if you want to add a bit more holding power.
Strategically placed upholstery locks help keep the tucked fabric in
place. Find out more about them in Chapter 14.
6. With the cushions still in place, trim the fabric at the bottom of the
loveseat or sofa, cutting it carefully to make it even all the way around.
If you want to add a decorative trim with a glue gun, you don’t need to
sew a hem. Head to the next section “Measuring and attaching decora-
tive trim.”
If you plan to hem the slipcover without using trim, cut it so that it
grazes the floor, with an inch or so of extra fabric. Doing so provides
enough fabric to create a 1⁄2-inch bottom hem.
When you’re ready to hem, follow these basic steps:
1. Remove the slipcover from the loveseat or sofa and spread your
fabric over your workspace.
2. Create a 1⁄2-inch hem by using the fold-and-fold method we talk
about in Chapter 14.
3. Use your sewing machine (or use iron-on bonding tape like Stitch
Witchery if you prefer), to hem the bottom of the slipcover.
7. Remove the cushions to cover them with your slipcover fabric.
The amount of fabric you reserved for the cushions depends on how
many cushions you have on your loveseat or sofa. Cut the fabric into
equal pieces, one for each cushion.

Chapter 11: Tackling the Easy Stuff: Simple Slipcovers

8. Wrap each cushion like a gift.
9. Tuck both ends of the fabric underneath the bottom of the cushion
and use a safety pin to pin the flaps into place (see Figure 11-2).
Use additional safety pins to secure the fabric directly to the underside
of the cushion, if you want — you’ll want a tight fit for a neat look.
10. Place the cushions back on the loveseat or sofa, making sure every-
thing looks crisp and even.
Measuring and attaching decorative trim
The best and most accurate way of determining how much decorative trim
you need is to remove the fabric from the loveseat or sofa after you’ve prop-
erly tucked it in so that the fabric is even all the way around and after you’ve
cut off any excess so all sides are even. Unfortunately, doing so means that
with these tuck-and-pin projects, you have to make two trips to the fabric
store — one for the fabric and one for the trim. It’s an extra step and seems
like a bother, but because trims tend to be costly, we think doing it this way
is more economical and in the end easier.
Measure the area of the fabric at the bottom of the loveseat, going all the way
around with your measuring tape. After you’ve tucked and pinned the fabric
of your new slipcover back on your sofa or loveseat, you can use a hot glue
gun to attach your trim. Using a hot glue gun is fast, easy, and fun. Because
fabric is porous, hot glue is a natural for bonding fabrics together. Just follow
these two easy steps:
1. Heat your glue gun so that the glue inside has sufficiently melted.
2. Attach the trim by adding dots of hot glue to the back of the trim
every few inches and pressing it into place (see Figure 11-3).

Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

Covering an Armchair
Armchairs are naturals for slipcovering, and we offer you a few options in
this section. Armchairs are usually lighter-weight pieces of furniture, so they
don’t need to be as stationary as sofas or loveseats, which tend to stand
silently against walls. Consider arranging your furniture so that everyone can
see your armchair from all sides, allowing your fabric choice to take center
stage and define the space.
If you’re covering an armchair that has a rounded back, consider a fabric that
drapes well, such as slipcover-grade chenille or soft twill. A stiff or overly
crisp fabric, such as toile, just doesn’t do a curvy armchair back justice.
However, with a square-backed armchair, you won’t have any problem with
Figure 11-3:

Chapter 11: Tackling the Easy Stuff: Simple Slipcovers
Keeping everything in place
Easy no-sew and low-sew slipcovers are great,
but what about using those fabrics that have
more slip than usual? You don’t want your
guests sliding onto the floor mid-conversation.
Some fabrics that have a shiny, slippery
finish — chintz and sateen come to mind — are
prone to slippage. If you decide to use a slippery
fabric for your creation, be sure to check out
Chapter 14, where we talk about shortcuts and
the art of placing no-slip rubber under cushions
and using Velcro and upholstery locks.

the fabric draping, so you can use a fabric with more body, even Ultrasuede,
one of our favorites for creating a rich, soft effect with fabric.
This section features a simple project to re-create your armchairs in no time
at all. Covering an armchair this way takes about an hour. You may even want
to ask your child to help: It’s that easy. 
Getting the right amount 
of fabric and trim
We designed this project for a basic armchair that’s of average size, but you
can adapt it to an armchair of any proportion. Measuring your armchair is
easy: 
1. From the back of your chair, measure up and over the seat back,
across the cushion and front and down to the floor in front.
This measurement is the length.
2. For the width, measure the entire chair from left side to right, starting
on the floor on one side and going over the seat down to the floor on
the other side. 
For more information about tuck-ins and other essentials for measuring
your armchair, see Chapter 10.
Basically, you need about 3 yards of 105-inch-wide fabric. If you can’t find a
105-inch-wide fabric that you like, you can sew two 60-inch-wide pieces of
fabric together (or three pieces of 45-inch-wide fabric) to create one piece of
fabric large enough to cover the whole chair. In this case, you need about 4 to
6 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric or 8 to 10 yards of 45-inch-wide fabric. (To con-
vert other widths, check out the Yardage Conversion Table in the Cheat Sheet
in the front of the book.)
Look for wide fabric for armchairs: 105-inch-wide fabric is ideal because it
cuts down on your sewing time. (If you can’t find 105-inch-wide fabric, you
need to join fabric together for adequate width to cover your furniture.)
Another alternative to 105-inch-wide fabric is using a queen-size flat sheet to
cover the armchair and a twin-size flat bed sheet to cover the cushion (see
Chapter 2 for more about using bed sheets). Combined, these sheets give you
ample fabric. Choose good-quality sheets so the slipcover you make from
them lasts.
198
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

This project also calls for a few yards of decorative trim. Just as we suggest
in the sofa and loveseat project earlier in this chapter, you must determine
the amount of trim you need by measuring the fabric all the way around the
bottom of the armchair after you’ve placed the fabric over the chair and
secured and trimmed it. The armchair we covered needed 7 yards.
Gathering your gear
Another nice thing about this project is that it provides near-instant gratifica-
tion. You can shop for your fabric and trim in the morning or afternoon and
have your armchair covered that evening. Here’s what you need to make this
project:
 Enough fabric to cover your chair
Our chair called for 3 yards of 105-inch-wide fabric or 4 yards of 60-inch-
wide fabric (refer to the previous section, “Getting the right amount of
fabric and trim”).
 Cloth measuring tape
 Hot glue gun and glue sticks
 Iron and ironing board
 A box of 2-inch safety pins
 Scissors

Chapter 11: Tackling the Easy Stuff: Simple Slipcovers
Dollars and cents: A sample budget
Making a beautiful no-sew armchair slipcover
doesn’t mean you have to break the bank. You
can estimate the cost at about $80 to $95 for a
really gorgeous slipcover, and that includes the
cost of a good-quality glue gun (which you can
use again and again on other projects).
The cost fluctuates, depending on how elabo-
rate you want to go with the fabric type and
application. Here’s how we figured it:
 3 or 4 yards of fabric: $36 to $48 for a nice
brocade fabric
 Hot glue gun: $10
 Package of glue sticks: $3
 Safety pins: $2
 7 yards of decorative trim: $30 to $40
 Iron-on bonding tape (like Stitch Witchery):
$4
 Upholstery locks (optional): $8

 Decorative trim (optional)
If you decide to cover the bottom of your chair with trim, the amount
you need depends on the size of your chair (refer to “Getting the right
amount of fabric and trim” — yardage depends on the size of the chair).
 Iron-on bonding tape, like Stitch Witchery (optional)
 Sewing machine (optional)
 Upholstery locks (optional)
Getting started
When you’re ready to work, plan an hour of free time for this project. Here’s
how to do it correctly:
1. Iron all your fabric well, so that it drapes easily over the chair.
2. Remove the chair cushion.
3. Working from the top of the chair, place your fabric over the top so
that it drapes evenly over the whole chair.
4. Tuck the fabric into the crack at the base of the seat and on the
insides of the arms.
Make sure that the fabric drapes evenly. If you prefer, you can add a few
upholstery locks (see Chapter 14) in discreet, unseen areas to ensure
that the fabric stays firmly in place.
5. Replace the cushion over the draped fabric.
You’ll be covering the cushion later; it’s just on top of the fabric to keep
it in place.
6. With the slipcover and cushion in place on the chair, take your scis-
sors and carefully trim the fabric in front of both arms, so that it’s
even with the fabric at the sides of the chair and in the back (see
Figure 11-4).
Decide how much “leg” you want your chair to show. Figure 11-4 shows a
chair showing some leg, even with the addition of fringe. The fabric can
also extend to the floor, if that’s the look you want.
Drape the fabric evenly all around the chair’s base, and it needs to be
about three inches from the floor if you plan to add trim and still show
some leg. If you plan to hem the bottom and add no trim, leave an extra
inch or so to create your bottom hem.

7. Finish the bottom with trim or with a hem.
If you choose to attach trim, follow these steps and refer to Figure 11-4:
1. With your hot glue gun, apply glue in dots on the backside of the
trim.
2. Press the trim on the fabric, using your thumb and finger.
If you choose to hem, follow these steps:
1. Remove the fabric from the chair and spread it on your work-
space.
2. Sew a 1⁄2-inch hem all around, or use iron-on bonding tape, like
Stitch Witchery, if you prefer.
8. Remove the cushion to cover it.
9. Place the cushion on the square of fabric you reserved for it and wrap
your cushion as you would a gift (refer to Figure 11-3).
10. Use safety pins to secure the fabric directly to the underside of the
cushion for a secure fit.
11. Tuck both ends of fabric underneath the bottom of the cushion and
use another safety pin to secure the flaps into place.
12. Put the cushion back on the chair, and you’re done!

Making Slipcovers for
Dining Room Chairs
This project is so easy and elegant that you’ll wonder why you didn’t think of
it yourself. It takes a bit of fussing, but the results are worth the extra effort.
No sewing is involved, so all you have to do is wrap, drape, tie, pin, and
arrange the fabric so it’s perfect to your eye.
We like having this slipcover for a dinner party or special holiday occasion.
After finishing one chair, the rest are a breeze to complete. Watch out —
this treatment is so easy you may find yourself making new slipcovers just
because your mother-in-law is coming for dinner on a Friday night (well,
maybe not . . . ). You can see this tied-and-draped dining room chair slipcover
in the color photo insert.
We used a cotton fabric to create the slipcover in the color insert, because
we were covering a square-shaped chair without any curves. Consider using
a polyester organza or polyester crepe for this project, especially if you have
a curvy or unusually shaped chair back; you want a fabric that drapes and
conforms to the curves.
Gauging your fabric needs
Most dining room chairs are generally the same size, give or take a few
inches. For our project, our chair was 44 inches high x 20 inches wide x about
22 inches deep. You need about 3 yards of 45-inch-wide fabric to cover one
standard-size dining room chair. If you have an oversize dining table and
chair set (we’re jealous!) and your dining room chair is wider than ours, you
may consider using 60-inch-wide fabric to guarantee adequate coverage.
To measure your dining room chair, use the same method as you would any
other chair, like our armchair project in this chapter: Start with the length.
From the back of your chair, measure up and over the seat back, across the
cushion and front and down to the floor in front. For the width, measure the
entire chair from left side to right, starting on the floor on one side and going
over the seat down to the floor on the other side. 
If you choose wisely, one neutral style of fabric can give you plenty of use,
because it can assume many attitudes as you add contrasting, interchange-
able ropes, ribbons, twines, and other trims to alter your slipcover’s appear-
ance (see Chapter 13 for more specific ideas). Check out the color insert for
the dining room chair slipcover, which is made more festive with the addition
of elaborate bows from 3 yards of 1-inch-wide satin ribbon.
202
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

Unless you’re a good fabric cutter, when you’re fabric shopping for four
chairs, be sure to add an extra half-yard or yard of fabric for each chair, in
case you make a mistake. You can always use the extra for some pretty coor-
dinating napkins or placemats.
Nabbing the necessary materials
The satin ribbon adds a really festive touch. You may have enough ribbon or
comparable trim in your sewing kit already, so dig around a bit. Here are the
items you need to make this slipcover for one dining room chair:
 Enough fabric to cover each chair
(Each of our chairs required 3 yards of 45-inch-wide fabric.)
 Iron and ironing board
 A box of 2-inch safety pins
 3 yards of 1-inch-wide satin ribbon
 A box of straight pins
 Scissors
Pulling the project together
These few steps couldn’t be simpler:
1. Iron all your fabric well, so that it easily drapes over the chair.
2. Starting at the floor in front of the chair and ending at the floor in the
back of the chair, evenly drape the fabric over the chair.
3. Working from behind the chair, take the edges of the fabric that are
near the top of the back of the chair and tie them in a knot (see
Figure 11-5).
4. Pull the edges of the fabric that hang underneath the knot toward the
base of the chair (where the back meets the seat), and pin them into
place to create a wall of fabric across the outside chair back (see
Figure 11-6).
5. Add the decorative ribbon if and where you want.
If you have an open-back chair, you can cut two 1-inch holes in the fabric
at the inside back of the chair base (near the chair’s solid, back support
area), thread 1-inch-wide ribbons through the holes, and tie them in two
bows (see Figure 11-7). Be sure to wind the ribbon through the safety pin
to add support. Each bow uses 11⁄2 yards of ribbon. The securely tied
bow helps keep the fabric in place.

If your chair doesn’t have an open back, consider tying a ribbon around
the entire chair at the base (where the back meets the seat). Be sure
your ribbon goes through the safety pins (see Figure 11-8).
Giving Your Ottoman a New Look
This project is a wonderful way to spruce up an old ottoman. Maybe yours is
covered in dark leather that’s cracking a bit or a fabric that’s generally seen
better days, and you want to add it to a room with a lighter, more modern
decor.
Figuring out the fabric and trim
The dimensions of the ottoman we slipcovered in this project are 19 inches
wide x 24 inches long x 13 inches high. (The ottoman cushion is 7 inches
thick, and the legs are 6 inches high, and we’re covering both the cushion
and the legs, so that the fabric reaches the floor.) For an ottoman of this or
similar size, you need 11⁄4 yards of 45-inch or 60-inch-wide fabric (your choice;
either provides adequate coverage).
Some great fabrics for covering ottomans are toile, brocade, brocatelle, tapes-
try, damask, denim, or even doupioni. Decide how rigorously your ottoman
will be used to help you choose the fabric that’s right for you.
The following info can help you determine how much fabric you need to
cover your ottoman:
1. Measure from the floor on the left side to the floor on the right side
and add 2 inches.
Safety pin
Figure 11-8:
Adding a
decorative
bow around
the base.
205
Chapter 11: Tackling the Easy Stuff: Simple Slipcovers

2. Do the same from the front to the back.
Our measurements came to 47 inches for the total width (19 inches wide
across the seat top, plus 2 inches, plus 26 inches for the sides, which
comes from 13 inches high on both sides) by 52 inches for the total
length (24 inches long, plus 2 inches, plus 26 inches high, again 13
inches for each side). 11⁄4 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric is enough to cover
both our ottoman’s width and length.
We definitely recommend adding a decorative trim to this project, rather than
just hemming it. The trim covers the raw edges and adds a touch of pizzazz to
the ottoman. You can choose any kind of decorative trim that you like.
How much trim do you need? Well, that depends on the size of your ottoman.
Measure around the bottom of the ottoman before you’ve covered it with your
fabric, and add a few inches, just to be on the safe side.
Assembling your supplies
Before you begin, you need these supplies on hand:
 Enough fabric to cover your ottoman
(Refer to “Figuring out the fabric and trim”; our ottoman required 11⁄4
yards of 60-inch-wide fabric.) 
 Hot glue gun and glue sticks
 Enough trim to go around the bottom edge of fabric
(Again, refer to “Figuring out the fabric and trim”; our ottoman required
21⁄2 yards of trim)
 Iron and ironing board
 A box of straight pins
Making your easy ottoman
Hot glue makes this project super easy and fun. Working right on the
ottoman — draping your fabric on the ottoman and using it as your guide —
is a great way to make it properly. Follow these steps and you’ll be done in
no time:
1. Iron all your fabric well, so it drapes easily over the ottoman.
2. Align the center of your fabric with the center of the top of the
ottoman, letting the fabric fall down evenly on all sides.
The fabric must drape so that it’s almost touching the floor on all sides.
206
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

3. Fold and wrap the fabric on the sides the way you would a package.
4. Pin the fabric in place with straight pins (see Figure 11-9).
5. Trim any excess fabric around the bottom of the ottoman with your
scissors.
6. With your hot glue gun, glue the fabric of the folded flaps together.
Remove the straight pins as one area becomes secure. Glue in between
the folds to keep the fabric from shifting (refer to Figure 11-9).
Don’t be shy with the glue gun! Each time you remove a pin, be sure to
add at least one large dot of hot glue in its place.
7. Starting at on one edge, line the bottom of the ottoman with trim, care-
fully adhering it with dots of glue every 3 inches (see Figure 11-10).
And there you have it, a brand new ottoman.

Slipcovering a Vanity Stool with Lace
This slipcover technique is simple and fun. You can slipcover a vinyl-topped
vanity stool, which you can easily buy inexpensively at any discount depart-
ment store. With this project, you can modify almost any generic stool, truly
making it one of a kind. Take a peak at the color photograph insert of this
book for our lace-covered vanity stool.
We recommend lace for this stool, because it’s a classic, pretty look for a
stool that’s used in a bathroom, bedroom, or dressing room and because the
natural holes within the lace cut down on time spent snipping the fabric to
accommodate the ribbon. Do, however, feel free to adapt this technique for
other types of fabric that match your room’s style. You want to select a fabric
that drapes well yet still has a bit of weight to it, and which is not too slip-
pery. Try a pretty printed cotton, a Swiss dot, or a cotton eyelet, all of which
lend themselves to the delicate feeling of a vanity stool.
Picturing the perfect lace and ribbon —
and the perfect amount
Finding the right lace is the only trick to making this project correctly. The
lace must be 60 inches wide and must have enough natural openings to
accommodate the ribbon — or open work areas that can be snipped to allow
the ribbon in. Many polyester laces come in the 60-inch width, or you may
want to consider using eyelet, which often comes 60 inches wide.
To determine how much 60-inch-wide fabric you need to cover your stool:
1. Measure the height and double it.
2. Add to that number the measurement of the diameter of the stool seat
plus 1 inch.
For example, if your vanity stool is 16 inches high and the diameter of
the seat is 15 inches, you need a piece of fabric that is 48 inches long
(16 +16 +15 +1 = 48).
To determine how much ribbon you need, measure the circumference of your
seat and double it so you’ll have plenty to weave in and out of the slits in
your fabric and create a pretty bow. Ribbon isn’t too expensive, and it’s
always better to have a bit more than not enough. Pick any type of ribbon
that you like — satin, grosgrain, or even a fancy woven ribbon.
208
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

We chose 1⁄4-inch-wide ribbon because it was thin enough to fit through the
natural openings in the lace we chose. You can go a bit wider if you intend
to snip the holes yourself, or if your lace can accommodate wider ribbon. 
Gathering your supplies
Before you begin, gather these supplies:
 Appropriately measured piece of lace or fabric
 1⁄4-inch-wide ribbon (refer to the previous section to figure out how much)
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 A box of straight pins
Fashioning your stool slipcover
The only challenge to creating this simple slipcover is draping your fabric
evenly. Have fun when weaving the ribbon through; it doesn’t have to be per-
fect. Following these steps is a cinch:
1. Iron your lace or fabric well, so it drapes easily over the stool.
2. Place the lace or fabric evenly over your vanity stool and secure it to
the cushion at the top with straight pins (see Figure 11-11).
The pins are just temporary. You’ll remove them when you’ve secured
the lace with your ribbon. Don’t use pins for fabric that will show punc-
ture marks, like vinyl; use a book or other weight to keep the fabric in
place instead.

Chapter 11: Tackling the Easy Stuff: Simple Slipcovers

3. Weave the ribbon in and out of the naturally occurring holes in the
lace. 
If you have chosen a fabric without naturally occurring holes, snip open-
ings in your fabric just wide enough so that your ribbon can weave
through without any resistance.
Weave the ribbon through the fabric or lace all around the base — the
area where the seat meets the legs of the stool (refer to Figure 11-11).
4. Pull the ribbon tight, tie it in a knot, and create a bow.
Carefully sit on the seat to make sure the ribbon has secured the slip-
cover over the seat (watch those pins!). If you’re satisfied, remove the
straight pins.
5. Trim the lace or fabric at the bottom of the stool (see Figure 11-12).
You can do this step by either cutting it in a straight line or by following
the lace’s natural pattern as you cut for a rounded bottom edge — it’s up
to you!

f you think trims and other add-ons are just for window treatments, think
again. Accessorizing your slipcover is another opportunity to express
your creativity, and a great way to pull your whole room’s look together. You
can add complementary colors from your decor to your “new” furniture in
the form of accessories. You can also add the trim or trims that adorn your
window treatment, which give your room a pulled-together feeling.
If you’re a die-hard, less-is-more minimalist, or you hate fussy fringes and
gaudy ribbons, and prefer to skip this chapter altogether, hang on for a bit. If
you haven’t lately taken a look at decorative trim, you’re sure to be surprised
at what’s available. Designers are creating trims in many styles and from many
unusual materials — suede, feathers, wood, fur, crystals, raffia, and metallic
thread — as well as traditional silk, cotton, and wool. Some of the looks are
very ornate and baroque, some are whimsical and modern, and some are geo-
metric and contemporary, so something is available for everyone.
This chapter shows you how to add different decorative trims and flourishes
to the basic slipcovers we offer in this book. (You may also want to check out
Chapter 8, our window treatment accessories chapter, for some decorating
ideas and techniques that may also apply to slipcovers.)

Choosing Decorative Trim
Trim is the general term used for the decorative add-ons that are applied to
the edges and faces of fabrics. 
The following are a few terms you may encounter when adding decorative
trim to your slipcovers:
 Cord is a round, twisted group of fibers that looks like a tiny rope.
 Fringe is a trim consisting of a band of fabric, called the heading, and a
skirt, which consists of the threads that create the fringe (see “Attaching
Decorative Trim” later in this chapter for more on this type of trim).
 Ribbon is another decorative trim that comes in many styles, widths,
textures, and edges.
For a deeper discussion and recommendations on trims, see Chapter 8.
Deciding what kind of trim you want to add to your project is mostly a matter
of taste. For example, if you like an ornate look, consider using a jasmine,
which is a trim that features a cut fringe skirt interspersed with tiny tassels; a
bullion fringe, which resembles the epaulettes of military uniforms; or even a
moulinee trim, which features multicolored tassels. For a simpler feel, try a
flat trim, such as a grosgrain ribbon, which has a ribbed texture and is easy
to work with because it doesn’t snag, or a picot-edge trim, which is a type of
ribbon that features a rounded decorative edging.
When shopping for trim for your slipcover, you do need to remember a few
important points:
 Keep in mind the scale of the slipcover fabric to which you’re attach-
ing the trim and the proportion of the furniture you’re covering. If
you’ve chosen a floral-patterned mediumweight cotton chintz to cover
your smaller loveseat, most people would find that an accessory with a
small-to-medium scale is ideal — a trim with a medium-length fringe and
not-overly ornate style (so the trim isn’t too large for the furniture’s size
and doesn’t compete with the fabric pattern).
But say you’re adding an accessory to a sofa slipcover made from a
heavyweight velvet. Why not add some beautiful cord and tassels, as
well as a formidable trim, such as a wide embroidered braid or a thick
bullion fringe? Most velvet is strong enough to carry the load of many
accessories, both aesthetically and physically, so why not go for it if it
suits your decor?
212
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

 Be sure to buy a bit more trim than you need. As with fabrics, the dye
lots for trims vary, and you don’t want to be caught short only to return
to the store to find the colors don’t match or that the store no longer
carries the trim.
 Make sure that your fabric can support the trim’s weight. A too-heavy
trim can cause your fabric to sag and pucker. You don’t want to waste
time and money on a trim that you later discover ruins the look you
wanted with your slipcover.
 Consider using trims in unconventional ways. Contrasts in materials
can pack a lot of design punch. Why not add an inherently opulent trim,
such as a beautiful multicolored tassel fringe, to a plain but strong
fabric, like cotton duck? Let your color palate unite the two disparate
elements. This idea may work well, especially if your decor is eclectic.
Attaching Decorative Trim
After you find the perfect trim, you may wonder where to apply it to your
new slipcover. Our answer: Anywhere you like! Traditionally, trim goes along
the bottom edges of slipcovers — at the place where your slipcover fabric
touches the floor — but you don’t have to conform. You can add the trim any-
where you prefer. For example, consider using flat trims to create stripes or
patterns across the face of your sofa fabric. Or, add appliqués anywhere you
want — as few or as many as your heart desires (see “Adding Appliqués”
later in this chapter for more hints). (If you intend to launder your slipcover,
choose a trim that is washable, and pretreat it before you sew it on.)
You can break decorative trim down into many different categories (see
Chapter 8 for a discussion on how to handle trims). The different categories
include handmade or machine made, natural fiber or synthetic, and inexpen-
sive or yikes, very expensive! In this section we divide them into two cate-
gories: trims with a heading and trims that are plain (without headings),
because they’re attached to slipcovers differently.
With heading
Fringe is a trim that is made up of two parts: headings and skirts. The headings
are usually flat, woven tops or decorative braids, and the skirts are the tassels
or cut yarn that form the “fringe” part that hangs down. A few two-part fringes
that are popular are ball fringes, bullion fringes, and tassel fringes.
For fringes, attach the heading area to the fabric, either by sewing a zigzag
stitch with a matching thread or with hot glue.
213
Chapter 12: My Slipcover Is Better Than Yours: Knockout Accessorizing

Plain (without heading)
Flat braid, ornate braid, and decorative ribbon have no heading, so you stitch
both edges to the fabric. To add tassels to slipcovers, drape them over the
furniture corners (you can use a chair tie, which has ready-made tassels on a
length of matching cord, or stitch a complimentary corded rope trim to your
tassel to add length) or attach them to the corners of pillows.
To finish the ends of your trim, either turn the trim under and stitch it in
place with many stitches (as you would back tack on the sewing machine) or
you can conceal the ends in a seam. You can also add some Fray Check to the
cut ends to keep them from unraveling (see Chapter 3 for more information).
If you decide to use a glue gun to attach a trim, be careful to go slowly and
don’t use too much glue. Stray glue is especially hard to remove from the
threads of fringe. Pin your trim in place first and never stretch it to gain
length, which causes puckering.
Don’t cut your trim until you’ve applied it all the way around the area of your
slipcover. You may need a bit extra at the ends. Also many trims have a ten-
dency to unravel, so keep the cut ends wrapped with Scotch tape until you’re
done handling it. Doing so helps keep the integrity of an ornate trim.
Layering trim for even more drama
Adding one trim to another can create a very dramatic look. By layering trim
you can create the ideal accessory for your project, one that you can’t find in
the store.
One way to layer trim is to sew or hot glue upholstery braid over ribbon for
added color, texture, and dimension. You first need to sew or hot glue them
together before adding them to your slipcover.
Layering fringe creates the same kind of visual interest as layering fabric. We
love tassel fringe layered over bullion fringe, especially when the colors are
close, so the two trims blend into one. You can pin one layer of fringe to the
other and sew them both to your slipcover fabric at once. We don’t recom-
mend using hot glue, it’s just too messy with two fringes.
Some fringe, especially beaded fringe, comes attached to a nondecorative
ribbon that is meant to be hidden away in a fabric seam (see Chapter 17 to
see where we discuss adding piping to a seam; it’s essentially the same con-
cept when adding fringe). If you love the fringe but don’t want to insert its
heading into a seam, you can turn the nondecorative heading into a decora-
tive heading by thinking outside the box. 
214
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

Some fringe is attached to a sheer ribbon; if you like the look of the sheer
ribbon, incorporate it into the look of your slipcover. For example, for a light-
weight slipcover, a sheer ribbon heading looks pretty sewn onto a fabric like
taffeta or chiffon. You can further adorn the heading with sequins, rhine-
stones, or paillettes (see Chapter 9 for a discussion on those embellishments
and how to apply them). A plain or twill-weave heading can look just right on
a slipcover made from “tough” fabrics, such as duck or denim. You can also
cover the heading with a length of upholstery braid or even some beautiful
woven ribbon. If it’s too wide to be hidden by the covering braid, feel free to
cut off a bit of the heading fabric, but not too much, and be very careful not
to snip the threads that keep the beads in place.
Adding Appliqués
We love appliqués, whether they’re hand-made or store-bought. Crafts and
fabric stores stock some beautiful beaded and sequined appliqués that pack a
style punch for not that much money. Ornate or low-key, appliqués add tons of
individuality and wonderful texture to any piece of slipcovered furniture.
Apply as many of them anywhere you want, following the scale principle: For
a small piece of furniture, let your appliqués be of a smaller scale; for a larger
slipcover, your appliqués can become proportionately larger.
If you want to make your own, create an appliqué from a nonraveling fabric,
like felt. If you have a serger (see Chapter 5), your fabric choices can be
wider. The whipstitching seals the appliqué’s edges to keep it from fraying.
For a few appliqué ideas, check out Chapter 8.
Here’s the easiest way to create and attach appliqués:
1. After you decide which image you want to create or replicate, grab
your marker and draw it on the wrong side of your appliqué fabric
(be sure to turn your pattern wrong side up if it’s not symmetrical) or
trace it with tracing paper and tape it over your fabric, and then draw
it on.
2. Cut out your appliqué and pin it to your slipcover fabric, which should
be on your furniture so you can see that the appliqué’s orientation is
correct.
3. Remove the slipcover and use a zigzag stitch to attach the appliqué.
Add a bit of padding between the appliqué and the slipcover fabric to create
some dimension. You can pick up a package of low-loft cotton or polyester
batting at any crafts or fabric store.
215
Chapter 12: My Slipcover Is Better Than Yours: Knockout Accessorizing

We recommend button and carpet thread, which is a special heavy-duty
thread used when you’re sewing something onto fabric that receives daily
wear and tear. The thread’s inside is polyester, and the outside is cotton; its
synthetic core gives it its added strength. Consider it for appliqués or other
embellishments you’re sewing to slipcovers.
Looking at Alternatives to Sewing
on Trims and Appliqués
Do you dread turning your sewing machine on? Or are you simply looking for
a timesaving alternative to using a sewing machine? Well, we have some good
news. When applying trims and appliqués to your slipcovers, you don’t nec-
essarily have to sew them. In fact you can use the following choices when
applying your extras to your slipcover.
Consider using iron-on bonding tape, snaps, or hot glue from a glue gun to
attach your decorative extras. Before considering these methods, take a look
at Chapter 5 to weigh their pros and cons. If you decide to give these meth-
ods a try, you may be surprised to discover other ways to use them.
 Iron-on bonding tape: If you don’t want to sew, consider using Stitch
Witchery or another brand of iron-on bonding tape, which can be a great
sewing substitute. It comes in a variety of widths; the wider type is ideal
for adhering appliqués. Use it for attaching appliqués and flat trims with-
out skirts, such as ribbons and braids. (Check out Chapter 5, where we
discuss this tool at length.)
 Snaps: Are you the type of person who likes a change of scenery or who
likes to redecorate for the holidays or a new season? Instead of sewing
on a permanent accessory, consider attaching snaps to your slipcover
so you can change your trim, appliqués, or other adornments at whim.
This idea works best on a neutral-tone solid-fabric slipcover — white,
cream/beige, khaki, or sand — so your adornments never clash with the
slipcover. Attaching snaps rather than sewing them is also a great trick
if you choose nonwashable trims; when you need to launder your slip-
cover, just snap the trim off and you’re good to go.
Pick up a quantity of well-made 1⁄2-inch metal snaps, and mark the box
with the name of the piece of furniture you’re treating so you can always
find the right size among your sewing supplies when you want to make
an accessory change.
216
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

To create a template for attaching snaps to an appliqué, cut out a piece
of tracing paper that matches the appliqué in dimension and mark three
or four dots near the edges of the appliqué’s border, depending on its
size. Doing so allows you to mark your slipcover fabric to match where
your snaps go. If your appliqué isn’t symmetrical, mark the tracing to
indicate which side goes against the slipcover.
To apply trim to the bottom of your slipcover with snaps,
1. Get out your measuring tape and tailor’s chalk and mark 4-inch
intervals along the edge (or wherever you want to apply your
trim).
2. Sew on the “female” half of a snap to the slipcover at each mark.
3. Mark the wrong side of the trim at the same interval and attach
the opposite part (the “male” side) of a snap to each mark — we
recommend that you always sew, not hot glue, your metal snaps.
It doesn’t matter what half of the snap you add to the slipcover
and which to the trim.
 Hot glue: Rather than sewing, you can create season- or holiday-themed
appliqués and add a matching trim to your sofa’s skirt with hot glue.
Bells and bows with green-and-red trim make a festive Christmas couch!
Hot glue animal-shaped buttons or simple round ones in many colors to
the backs of the plastic snaps (rather than metal ones, which usually do
not adhere well to glue) and you have instant polka dots. Kids love this
fun application (but be careful when using it around very young children,
who will surely pop a button off and want to stick it in their mouths).
Embellishing Your Slipcover
If you want to embellish your slipcover, you have a couple options to add a
little punch. You can either embroider or stencil your slipcover and give it a
unique look.
Embroidery
Consider adding a bit of embroidery to your slipcover. A lot or a little,
embroidery adds a unique charm wherever it’s applied. Some modern sewing
machines come with an embroidery function built in, and if yours has one,
you probably have friends begging you to try it on their own creations. Some
of the newer ones are programmable and can do truly amazing design work.

Chapter 12: My Slipcover Is Better Than Yours: Knockout Accessorizing

If your sewing machine doesn’t have an embroidering function, you have to
work by hand. To make your work easier, you can buy iron-on transfer designs
from crafts stores or online sewing supply sites (see our suggestions in
Chapter 20), which give you a clear pattern to follow as you stitch.
Stencils
Creating a motif on your slipcover fabric with stencils and special fabric
paint (also available at crafts stores) is another way to add some panache.
Here’s how:
1. Drape your fabric for no-sew slipcovers, or your finished slipcover for
sewn slipcovers, over your piece of furniture.
2. Grab your tailor’s chalk and draw a tiny arrow pointing to the bottom
of the fabric so each motif will be painted on in the correct direction.
3. Remove the slipcover from your furniture, and lay it over a flat sur-
face before you use your stencil to paint the motif wherever you want.
Some fun ideas include pastel bunnies, chicks, and flowers for a child’s room;
metallic fleur-de-lis, stars, moons, and suns for a more formal room; and veg-
etables and fruits for a kitchen. The possibilities are endless!

veryone messes up at one time or another. However, you don’t have to
let those mistakes ruin your slipcover project. Fixing those foul-ups can
provide you with a way to make your slipcover even better, by adding cre-
ative embellishments to make your slipcover truly special. We provide some
tips in this chapter to help you if you’ve made a mistake. We offer you several
shortcuts, as well as some specific “problem furniture” hints and tips in this
chapter with the hope that they both lower your frustration level and boost
your fun quotient.
In this chapter, we also offer several slipcover-making shortcuts that are sure
to please, and we offer a few words on using darts, trims, fringe, and ruffles to
tidy up any errors you may encounter.
Simple Slipcover Shortcuts
We don’t want to rush you, but when it comes to measuring, cutting fabric,
and sewing, who wants to spend more time than they have to? Get the job
done quick and easy with these shortcuts.

Using sheets as your fabric
Our all-time favorite shortcut is using sheets to make draped or sewn slipcov-
ers. Because you get so much width, you don’t have to sew fabric panels
together, which saves beaucoup (that’s French for a lot!) time and trouble.
(Check out Chapter 2 for more information.)
You can also use a well-made tablecloth, but only if the fabric is sturdy
enough to withstand the impact of a human body. Check the care label to
confirm the fiber content and give it a good strong pull before you commit to
using it to make a slipcover.
Going for solid fabrics
Another shortcut that we recommend throughout this book is using a solid
fabric or an allover petite print fabric so you don’t have to waste time and
money matching pattern repeats.
If you think a solid fabric sounds too boring and you’re set on adding a slip-
cover with a lot of pizzazz to your decor, consider using a few of our acces-
sory suggestions in Chapter 12.
Creating a rub-off pattern
Another great time-saver is using a rub-off pattern, which is a pattern-making
technique that employs chalk and which is quick and easy. A rub-off pattern
allows you to create patterns in the exact shape of your furniture’s parts. You
don’t have to guess and you have little room for error because you’re creat-
ing your pattern right on your furniture. It’s the haute couture approach to
slipcover design (but without all the drama!). Check out Chapter 10 to find
out how to make one.
Be sure to always add your seam allowance, and for pieces that include the
slipcover’s bottom area, the hem allowance.
Cutting down on cutting time
If you’re working with a solid fabric or an allover petite print, you can save
time when cutting mirrored pieces — two sides of a chair, two sides of a
dining room table — if you fold your fabric in half and cut through two layers
220
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

at once. Be sure to pin your pattern to the fabric well so there’s no slippage.
If you’re working with a fabric with nap or a one-way design, you’ll have to
make sure that the fabric is going in the same direction for each piece— in
the latter case you can fold it in half lengthwise, but for wider pattern pieces
you have to cut the fabric in half crosswise and rotate it 180 degrees to cut
two at once.
Messing Up Isn’t the End of the World
Your slipcover slides on okay, but it doesn’t look perfect. See if any of these
quick fixes can cure what ails your project.
Hiding holes
Hey, nobody’s perfect! If you’ve been less than diligent with your cutting
tools, cover your accidental hole or rip with an appliqué. You can even cut
out a few motifs from a printed fabric you used to create your window treat-
ment and sew them on. Read all about applying appliqués and get some great
ideas to perfect your slipcover in Chapters 8 and 12.
Be sure to apply your appliqués evenly and mirror them on opposite sides
of your slipcover to keep the feeling of a true design detail, and not just a
Beverly Hillbillies–style furniture patch!
Getting rid of bagginess with darts
Darts are a way of tucking in excess fabric to get a cleaner, more streamlined
look. They’re great to apply around curves to get the smooth, rounded effect
you want. Think of a tailored shirt or a fitted dress: The contours that hug the
body are created with darts. The same principle applies to sofa, loveseat, and
armchair slipcovers.
To tailor your slipcover with darts, follow these easy steps:
1. Turn your slipcover inside out and place it back on the piece of furni-
ture for which it was intended.
2. Note which areas are a bit baggy, pinching the offending fabric up
and away from the surface of the furniture.
221
Chapter 13: Easy Street: Slipcover Shortcuts and Mistake Meltaways

3. Pin it so that the two sections of fabric come together creating a
smooth surface beneath it.
To create a dart correctly, start pinning at one corner and work your
way out to the other corner. Unless your darts are big and interfere with
the way the slipcover smoothes out on the furniture, you don’t need to
cut away the excess fabric.
4. Sew your darts individually with the straight stitch setting on your
sewing machine.
If you have a bit of bagginess on one side of your slipcover, chances are you
have it on the other side as well, so create your darts on each side in mirror
images to ensure a great fit.
Giving a too-tight slipcover 
some breathing room
What if you’ve done your best to get a perfect, snug fit but your slipcover
ended up being too tight (you barely got it on, and you risk popping the
seams if you sit on it)? If you planned a 1-inch seam allowance, get out your
seam ripper, open up your seams, and resew them with a smaller seam
allowance.
If you didn’t start with a 1-inch seam allowance, don’t despair. Just add some
strips of fabric (one with stretch, such as Lycra, may be just the ticket) in
hidden areas (under cushions, in the back area) of your slipcover to give it
more wiggle room. By seeing where the fabric puckers — usually around the
area where two seams meet — when you place it on your furniture, you can
figure out where you need to add some give and how much you need. After
that, follow these steps:
1. Draw a straight line along the seam with some chalk.
Doing so helps you find the stressed area when you remove the slip-
cover from your furniture.
2. Open up your seam.
3. Sew your strips in with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
Covering a crooked hem with fringe
After you fit your slipcover on your furniture, you may notice that your
hem isn’t completely straight. Please refrain from running out of the room
222
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

screaming and pulling your hair out. Instead of starting over, consider adding
a decorative trim to disguise a crooked hem. Choose a trim that will give
you adequate coverage — a fringe trim (that has a decorative heading and
a skirt: see Chapters 8 and 12 for more) does the trick — so your mistake is
fully covered.
Pin your trim onto your slipcover while it’s still on the furniture, making sure
that the trim is parallel with the floor, not aligned with the slipcover hem
(which is crooked!). Try not to stretch the trim too tightly. Then remove it
and sew or hot glue your trim in place (see Chapters 8 and 12 for more infor-
mation on choosing and applying trims).
Reaching the floor with ruffles
Ruffles can extend a too-short slipcover hem, giving added length to a slip-
cover while providing a softening, feminine touch. (See Chapter 17 on how
to attach a soft skirt.)
You can choose from a few ways when treating the bottom of a slipcover with
ruffles:
 The easiest way to attach a ruffle is to sew it on to the hem’s underside
with a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine.
For a cleaner look, place the right side of the ruffle against the right side
of the slipcover, aligning the top of the ruffle with the bottom of the slip-
cover, and then use a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance to sew them together.
When finished, fold the ruffle down and press the area where it attaches
to the slipcover.
 You can also attach the ruffle to the topside of the slipcover — the right
side of the slipcover facing the wrong side of the ruffle and then add a
decorative trim (one without a skirt) over the area where the slipcover
fabric and ruffle meet.
You can topstitch the ruffle on with your sewing machine, and then use a
glue stick to keep your trim in place. Hand stitch or machine stitch your
trim permanently in place; the type of trim you choose determines if you
can run it through your machine.
Running on empty
Realizing you’re running out of fabric when you’re making a slipcover can feel
like you’re trapped in a sewing nightmare, but here we give you a bit of insider
info to help. In Chapter 10, we urge you to cut your large pieces first. If you
223
Chapter 13: Easy Street: Slipcover Shortcuts and Mistake Meltaways

did, but still find you’ve run out of fabric, consider using a contrasting fabric
for the sides of the sofa, armchair, or even dining room table. You can also
cover the cushions in a contrasting fabric, use the same fabric to create
piping, add a few-inch-wide band of the same fabric to lengthen a too-short
hem, or add a pillow cover to pull the slipcover’s “look” together.
If you’re running out of fabric, adding contrasting fabric is a nice opportunity
to introduce a small amount of medium- or large-scale print without having to
commit to excessive yardage and complicated layouts.
Reining in an unruly slipcover
Is your slipcover acting just a bit unruly? Elastic can help keep a sewn slip-
cover in its place. Attaching a few sections of elastic along the underside
areas of your slipcover can go a long way toward preventing slippage.
Your goal is to sew your elastic on so that it stretches along an area that hugs
the furniture. Think of the way elastic sheet corners keep fitted sheets on
your bed, or the elastic in a shower cap keeps it from slipping off your head.
Choose an elastic that is strong but not hard to work with. A 1-inch-wide elas-
tic of medium strength works fine. The best way to add elastic to the under-
side of a slipcover is to use your sewing machine’s zigzag stitch.
Trimming over crooked seams
You may find that after you’ve finished making your slipcover and put it on
your furniture, the seams are a bit crooked, or your slipcover lacks any
oomph. You can add a trim over the seams to give your slipcover a great look
and cover up any errors.
Flat trims work best because they’re easy to apply; they also frame a slipcover
nicely and provide contrast. However, fringe trims that hang down don’t work
as well on vertical seams because the skirts go in the wrong direction, giving
your slipcover a fuzzy or furry look instead of a chic one! Consider using a 
1⁄4-inch or 1⁄2-inch-wide ribbon; attach it with a zigzag stitch.
224
Part III: Slipcovers Made Easy 

A Few Slipcovering Tricks 
for “Problem” Furniture
This section provides a few scenarios that may help solve some of your
design dilemmas if you’re working with pain-in-the-rear furniture. We offer
you some ideas to dress up your furniture so it works with, and not against,
your room.
Your situation: A too-large sofa that seems to overtake a room.
Your solution: To make an overlarge sofa seem smaller, choose a solid slip-
cover color that matches your room’s wall color. You don’t have to match it
perfectly, but keep it in the family. For example, if your walls are cream, go for
a wheat color; if your walls are light blue, go up or down a shade, keeping the
tone warm or cool, depending on your color palate (for more on this topic,
see Chapter 1). If your walls are painted with flat (nonshiny) paint, chose a
slipcover fabric that has a matte, not a shiny texture.
Contrary to women’s thigh-camouflaging gospel, covering a sofa in black
fabric doesn’t make it look smaller; it just makes it look black.
Your situation: A flimsy, less-than-comfortable sofa that needs a bit of sub-
stance.
Your solution: Think about adding some cotton batting before you slipcover
your sofa. It doesn’t cost much and it beefs up a too-thin sofa while reducing
slipcover slippage. Your guests and family will thank you for it, and so will
your bank account! You can buy fusible batting that attaches right to the old
sofa or the regular kind that comes by the yard at the fabric store. Check out
Sewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Jan Saunders Maresh (Wiley) for more
information on batting and how to attach it correctly.
Your situation: You have a sectional sofa that feels dated.
Your solution: Don’t be afraid to break up a sectional that feels like it must
stay together. Consider a fabric that has a beautiful drape so it hangs well over
the areas where the sectional sofa has been separated. The slipcovers you
add to two sectional pieces cover and create new, separate identities. You can
even cover each section in different fabrics, so they’re really “divorced.”
If you find that you need to even out or bolster your sectional pieces, you can
add some fusible or regular batting to bulk up separated areas to create more
symmetry. The best way to add regular batting to “fill in” a piece of furniture
225
Chapter 13: Easy Street: Slipcover Shortcuts and Mistake Meltaways

is to whipstitch it in place by hand sewing, or if you don’t mind something
more permanent, use the fusible type.
Your situation: Your armchair armrests are shot, but the rest of the chair is
doing just fine.
Your solution: Who says you have to slipcover the whole chair? Make a pat-
tern just for the two arms and create armrest covers in a fun, contrasting
fabric. If your chair is a solid, consider using a print whose background or
base color matches the solid.

eady to step up the work a bit? We call the window treatments in this
chapter “intermediate” because they’re a bit more difficult than the low-
sew and no-sew projects in Chapter 7. With these projects you need to keep
your sewing machine and needle and thread ready. However, these projects
are still perfect for a beginner because we simplify the steps. Better yet, the
end results are truly gorgeous.
In this chapter, we show you how to create a few types of pretty valances,
how to work with ruffles, and how to make a few “specialty” curtains.
Discovering the World of Valances
Valances perch above the top of the window frame, and extend down not
more than a third of the window’s length. Valances provide many functions
and features to a window, including
 They add style to a window that you don’t necessarily want to cover
completely with a full drapery or curtain.
 They add some design flash to most any space.
 You can use them to pick up another element of style from a room, say,
the fabric or similar colors of an upholstered chair or accent pillow.
 They also cover up an unsightly rod or less-than-perfect window trim,
and soften the unfinished look of the top of an inexpensive Venetian
blind or simple pull shade.

What’s the best part of valances? Follow our easy steps, and valances are
also really easy to make.
Valances can be mounted inside or outside your frame. You can use almost
any rod for a valance, but if you’re trying to conceal the nondecorative pole
or rod from another treatment, use a flat rod. A flat rod is a no-see rod that
slides though the rod sleeve and has curved ends that extend out a few
inches, allowing another treatment to sit underneath. (See our discussion
on window treatment hardware in Chapter 4 for more info.)
Lined balloon valances
A fully lined balloon valance on a curtain rod is a nonmoving treatment that
looks complicated and fancy (when made with an ornate fabric, it harkens
back to Victorian style), but we keep it simple and painless to create. This
project resembles its name: It consists of three puffy balloon shapes side by
side, separated by two vertically shirred areas that create the balloon effect.
Regarding types of fabric for this project, try a lightweight cotton, a beautiful
chintz or taffeta, or even lace. However, stay away from fabric that’s too
heavy because you won’t be able to create the balloon effect, and too-soft
fabric with too much drape won’t retain the balloon shape.
Balloon valances also employ a fabric lining. When deciding on a fabric for
the lining, consider a contrasting decorator fabric in a weight similar to the
“front” fabric. You can pick up the small part of the lining that peeks out into
your room in your room design, and this treatment looks equally lovely from
the outside of the house. If you don’t want to match two prints, you can use a
classic lining fabric, such as ivory sateen.
This project calls for shirring, which is a way of getting a scrunched-up effect
by manipulating the fabric into rough-formed gathers. You move the fabric
into a smaller area by weaving a safety pin in and out of the fabric (think of
the way a worm would eat through a tasty green leaf!) to keep it held in place.
In this instance, you shirr the fabric and hold it fast with a safety pin to
create tiny pleats. For more info on shirring fabric, take a look at Sewing For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Jan Saunders Maresh (Wiley).
How much fabric to buy
To determine the fabric needs for your valance, follow these steps:
1. Measure across your window to where you intend to mount your
hardware for your width, and double it.
230
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

2. Determine how long you want your valance to be.
When determining length, consider your window’s proportion. If it’s a
very large and/or long window, go for a full one-third measurement for
your length and add 7 or 8 inches, to allow for the 2 inches of fabric that
turns over to the back to create the rod sleeve, and for the 5 or 6 inches
fabric that will be shirred upward into the safety pins.
In our project, we dressed a smaller-proportioned window, so we chose
a more modest length: Our 30- x 60- inch window used a piece of fabric
60 inches wide x 22 inches long, which “shirred up” to a final length of
14 inches.
What you need for your valance
Gather these items to make your valance:
 One piece of fabric (Refer to the previous section to figure out how
much you need for your window.)
 A lining fabric (measured the same way as your other fabric)
 One curtain rod
 Iron and ironing board
 Four 2-inch safety pins
 Sewing machine with appropriate color thread
 Straight pins
 Thread and needle
Getting started
To start your project, follow these steps:
1. Place your fabric and lining face-to-face on your worktable, and then
stitch them together 1⁄2 inch in from the edges, all the way around the
fabric, leaving a 4-inch opening at the center top of the valance.
Keep your fabric straight and flat to avoid buckling as it moves through
the machine.
2. After you’re done sewing, pull the fabric out through the hole so the
fabric is right side out; iron flat.
(No need to close up the 4-inch opening, you stitch it shut later in this
project when you create the rod sleeve.)
3. Using your straight pins, pin your lined fabric into pleats using
Figure 14-1 as a guide.
Keep your three sections of equal dimension (ours were 10 inches wide,
with two 6-inch pleats, created by inverting 3 inches on either side).
231
Chapter 14: Intermediate Window Treatments to Sink Your Needle Into

4. Fold the fabric at each side (refer to Figure 14-1) under 21⁄2 inches to
create a hem, and pin.
5. Press the pleats from top to bottom with your iron and, at each side
hem and on each side of each pleat, stitch 4 inches down from the top,
using Figure 14-2 as a guide.
You can do this step on your machine or by hand.
6. Now fold the top of your pleated panel over and down 2 inches, so
the fabric is folded toward the back, and stitch across as shown in
Figure 14-3, which will create your rod sleeve.
7. Prepare to shirr the fabric by flipping over the valance so that you’re
working on the back of the valance.
8. Locate the center of each pleat (by checking on the front of the
valance).
9. Starting an inch from the bottom, measure 5 or 6 inches up — this
spot is where you shirr.
10. Gather 5 or 6 inches of fabric into the safety pin, pushing the pin in
and out through the fabric. If you like the effect shown in Figure 15-4,
shirr through the outside side hems, as well.
Your fabric now fits into the 2-inch safety pin, which creates the
scrunchy gathers (see Figure 14-3).

11. Insert your curtain rod through the rod sleeve of your choice and
hang your valance.
Figure 14-4 shows a finished balloon valance.
Dramatic arched valances
An arched valance is a valance with an arch (imagine that), and this valance’s
arch is created at the hemline. Arched valances aren’t only dramatic, but also
they can give a short window the illusion of length if hung with an outside
mounted . By mounting the valance so that the center part of the arch’s
curve is just beneath the top part of your window frame, you can create the
illusion of adding another 8 or 10 inches to your window. This type of valance

233
Chapter 14: Intermediate Window Treatments to Sink Your Needle Into

can also nicely treat arch or half-circle windows if you mount the valance’s
rod in a spot that allows the treatment to highlight the window’s shape.
Try a lightweight cotton fabric or lace, chintz, gauze, or even plissé to get
an informal feeling. Damask and shantung can add drama to a more formal
room. (Refer to Chapter 2 for details about various window treatment fabric
options.)
Determining how much fabric you need
To figure out your fabric needs, measure your window width and triple it
for the fabric width. For your treatment length, 22 inches for a 60-inch-long
window is a good place to start. Increase that number if your window’s pro-
portion is longer or larger.
To create an arched valance for a 30-inch-wide window, use one piece of
fabric 90 x 22 inches, including a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance all around. (You
don’t have to worry too much about perfect on-the-money measurements of
seam allowance for this kind of project, because it’s gathered — the triple
width accommodates it.)
If you’re using 45-inch-wide fabric, simply sew two lengths together to make
your 90-inch-wide panel. Doing so gives your valance a center seam that you
can hide in the folds. (We recommend this tip for solids and petite prints;
larger prints may be hard to match.)
Gathering your supplies
Start by getting these materials together:
 One piece of fabric, measured to your window (refer to the previous sec-
tion for instructions)
 Chalk
 Cloth tape measure or L-square
 Curtain rod
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color thread
 Straight pins
Start your valance
A gorgeous arched valance is only a few moments away if you follow these
easy steps:
234
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

1. Fold your fabric in half width-wise — for example, your 90-inch-wide
fabric is now 45 inches wide — and add a few straight pins inserted
vertically to each side.
Doing so holds your fabric in place. Your pinned fabric is on the left, and
your fold is on the right.
2. Use your tape measure or L-square to measure 8 inches up from the
lower edge along the fold.
3. Use your dressmaker’s chalk to draw half an arch down to the bottom
left-hand side of your folded fabric, curving gently down to the corner
of the fabric.
Make sure your curve is slight, so the arch has a graceful curve (see
Figure 14-5). If you’re trying to match a special arch or half-circle window,
take the window’s curve into consideration when drawing your curve.
4. With your scissors, cut the curve, making sure you cut through both
layers evenly.
Use a paperweight or heavy book to keep the fabric from moving, if 
necessary.
5. Remove your straight pins and open up your fabric.
6. Hem your side and bottom edges, using the fold-and-fold technique.
Turn the right (face) side of your fabric under 1⁄2 inch, and then turn it
another 1⁄2 inch and stitch along the second fold’s edge (see Figure 14-6).
Because you’re sewing on the curve for the bottom hem, be careful and
move slowly as you stitch. You can first use a baste stitch to get it just
right, and then go back and sew it again once you’re satisfied with the
curve. Be patient: Otherwise, you may wind up with a crooked hem.
7. At the top of the valance, press the fabric under 1⁄2 inch with your iron
to prepare to create your rod sleeve.

8. Fold down the top of the fabric another 3 inches and sew across to
create your rod sleeve (shown in Figure 14-7).
Right now, your rod sleeve is 3 inches. It will be 11⁄2 inches after you com-
plete Step 9.
9. Sew another line parallel to the one you just created, measured down
from your new top hem 11⁄2 inches.

Doing so serves to create a 11⁄2-inch ruffle at the top of your valance,
which will be evident when you thread your rod through the fabric (refer
to Figure 14-7).

ruffled effect you like, and hang your new valance.

Most swag valances are fanciful creations that top elaborate drapes. This
simple swag valance project can top off your window on its own. It also looks
great teamed with sheers. Consider any fabric with a wonderful draping qual-
ity, such as gauze, challis, chiffon, polyester charmeuse, and many microfiber
fabrics. Here’s an added bonus: You can make this treatment in less than an
hour!
Note: This project calls for the use of your sewing machine’s gathering foot.
We also provide a note on how to sew this project with a straight stitch; you
can do it either way. (If you need any additional tips on how to gather, check
out Sewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Jan Saunders Maresh [Wiley].)

Fabric needs first
This project makes a swag that mounts over your window’s trim mold. To
determine your swag’s width, measure across your window and add in your 
1⁄2-inch seam allowance on both edges. Our window width is 30 inches, so we
used a piece of fabric that came in a standard 35-inch width and trimmed it
down to 32 inches (30 inches plus 1 inch on each side for the seam allowance).
You need a square piece of fabric for this swag, so make the length the same as
the width.
Gathering the goods
In order to make this valance, you need the following supplies:
 One square piece of fabric (see the previous section for measuring
advice)
 One decorative curtain rod
 Chalk
 Cloth tape measure or ruler (for drawing the chalk line)
 Iron and ironing board
 Sewing machine, with appropriate color thread
Making your swag valance
Follow these easy steps, and in no time at all, you can have your very own
swag valance:
1. Because you’re working with a square piece of fabric, choose which
side will be the top of your fabric and mark it with an X using dress-
maker’s chalk.
Doing so can help you determine throughout the project what edge
you’re working on.
2. Create a turn-under allowance to create your rod sleeve by turning
the fabric under 1⁄2 inch and pressing it flat with your iron.
3. Stitch the top hem closed with your sewing machine and hem your
sides using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
You don’t need to create a bottom hem.
4. To create the rod sleeve, turn the top of your fabric over 2 inches and
sew across with your sewing machine (see Figure 14-9).
5. Chalk a vertical line through the center of your curtain (on the under-
side of the fabric), starting at the bottom edge of the rod sleeve and
stopping at the unfinished bottom edge (see Figure 14-10).
Your fabric is now divided in half equally on each side.

6. Gather the fabric along the chalked line using the gathering foot on
your sewing machine.
Or, if you prefer, you can set your sewing machine on the longest stitch
possible and sew along the chalked line. When you’re done, pull the
under thread (the thread that comes out of the bobbin) while scrunching
the fabric together to create a gather (see Figure 14-11).

Press all the seams flat with an iron.
8. Hang your swag valance, and you’re done!
Working with Ruffles
Ruffles are great for kitchens and for making rooms look more feminine. They
work best in your home’s more informal rooms, such as kitchens and break-
fast nooks, bathrooms, and of course, little girls’ rooms. Ruffled curtains in a
light cotton gingham are adorable and make a room look fresh and new. You
may also want to try chintz or any type of cotton sheeting.
When working with ruffles, you have to gather long pieces of fabric onto the
edge of your curtain panel. Take your time and breathe deeply. You need to
be patient to get the look you want. (See also Chapter 7, where we offer an
easy lace ruffle project.)
Fabric needs
With this project you create two panels. For each panel, you need a width
equal to a little more than 3⁄4 of your total window (or rod) width. For your
length, add 5 inches to account for the fabric for your rod sleeve. If you want
another example of this project’s panel part, check out the crisscross cur-
tains project later in this chapter.

Make these curtains with adequate fullness, so be generous with your fabric
width. To make this project for 30- x 60-inch windows, use two panels of
fabric that each measure 25 wide x 65 inches long.
Gather your supplies
Get this gear together before you begin:
 Fabric for your curtains and the ruffles that go around them
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 Sewing machine
 Straight pins
Creating your ruffle curtains
Follow these steps closely while you sew your ruffles and you can’t go wrong:
1. Using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, hem the left side of the left panel and
the right side of the right panel.
241
Chapter 14: Intermediate Window Treatments to Sink Your Needle Into
Making ruffles
To create ruffles for any project, follow these
steps:
1. To determine the length of the ruffle, double
the measurement of the area you want to
cover. To determine the width, decide how
wide you’d like your ruffle to be, then
double it and add an inch for the seam
allowance.
After you know how long and wide your
ruffle should be, you can cut the strips that
will become the ruffles.
2. Fold the strips in half lengthwise and treat
them as one layer. Begin gathering your
fabric to create the “ruffle” effect.
The ratio of gathered strip to flat edge is two
to one.
The folded edge becomes the ruffle’s edge
and the raw edges become the seam
allowance, which you attach to the curtain
panel.
3. Pin the raw edge to your curtain fabric,
then sew the ruffle in place.

2. Now it’s time to sew your ruffle strip. For this project, the width needs
to be 5 inches and your ruffle strip’s length needs to be triple your
window measurement.
For a window that measures 30 x 60 inches, make two strips of fabric
that each measure 5 x 90 inches.
3. Sew the ruffle strips together end to end to create one strip.
The 90-inch-long strip now measures 180 inches long.
4. Fold the ruffle strip in half lengthwise and press with a hot iron.
Now the ruffle strip is 180 inches long and 21⁄2 inches wide (see
Figure 14-13).
5. To finish each ruffle strip, fold the right sides of the ends together
and using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance (aligning all the raw edges), stitch
them together (see Figure 14-14a), unfold them, and press with a hot
iron (see Figure 14-14b).
6. Gather your ruffles to 90 inches.
You can either use the gathering foot of your sewing machine to gather
the ruffles, or you use the presser foot of your sewing machine and use

your hand to the fabric along very evenly, so that it gathers while it’s
being sewn. This method can take some practice, but once you get the
hang of it, it’s very effective.
Another way to gather fabric by hand is to run a loose, long stitch with
your sewing machine on the 1⁄2-inch mark of the ruffle fabric, and then pull
the under thread and guide the fabric by hand to create the gathers. (If
you need any additional tips on how to gather, see Sewing For Dummies,
2nd Edition, by Jan Saunders Maresh [Wiley].)
7. Add your ruffle strips to the center and bottom of each panel.
Pin the ruffles on the right side of the fabric first so you know the exact
placement, making sure that the raw edges of the fabric are aligned.
8. Sew the ruffles onto the panel, from the very top all the way down to
the hem.
Follow your seam allowance as you sew and curve your stitches. Sew all
the way around to the side of each panel (see Figure 14-15).
9. Fold the top part of your curtain down 1⁄2 inch and press with a hot
iron.
10. Fold the top part down again another 4 inches, press with a hot iron,
and stitch across 4 inches from the top fold.
11. Make a parallel line of stitches 2 inches above the first line.
Doing so creates your rod sleeve and also creates a ruffle at the top at
the same time.
12. Slide the sleeve over the rod, and hang your finished curtains (see
Figure 14-16).

Making Other Types of Curtains
This section includes a few specialty curtains to try — for specific types of
windows or to impart a unique look. Casement curtains provide an inside-
mount, streamlined look, cafe curtains bring to mind the coffeehouses of
Europe, and crisscross curtains bring both elegance and great window 
coverage.
Casement curtains
Casement curtains attach to the window sash (the wood that holds the glass,
not the frame, the trim, or the wall above). This two-panel treatment works
for windows that open in the middle and swing outward (also known as case-
ment windows, surprise, surprise), but you can also use one panel of this
style for a glass-paneled door. This project attaches at the top and bottom so
you’ll need two create two rod pockets and use two rods.
The best fabric choice for these types of curtains is a sheer fabric, such as a
thin cotton like voile or batiste. The gathers formed by the fabric allow in light,
yet still provide privacy — the more gathers, the less light.
Figure 14-16:

touch to

244
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

To use this treatment on casement windows, carefully measure your window’s
interior sash area (see Chapter 6 for details on inside measuring versus outside
measuring). Make sure your window is deep enough to allow for the mounting
of a sash rod because casement curtains use a sash rod. (A sash rod is a thin,
no-show inside-mount rod.) If you’re covering the glass area of a French door,
attach thin cafe rods on the wood of the door, above and below the glass area,
before you start, and then measure the distance in between to determine
length. (A cafe rod is a slim decorative outside-mount rod, with finials.)
Casing your fabric needs
To determine your width measurement, add 4 inches to your window sash
width measurement to account for the seam allowances on each side of the
two panels. For your length, add 4 inches to the length (doing so accounts for
the rod sleeve at both the top and bottom).
For a casement window measuring 30 x 60 inches, cut two panels to each mea-
sure 17 (two panels that are 15 inches each, plus an inch on each side of each
panel for the seam allowance) x 64 inches. Note: If you want a flat, ungathered
panel, this amount of fabric is enough. If you want a more gathered look (which
gives more privacy), multiply your width by 11⁄2. For our size windows, add 23
inches to your width, so each panel would measure 40(17 plus 23) x 64 inches.
Getting started
Gather your gear before you begin:
 A few yards of sheer fabric per panel (For casement windows that open
in the middle, you need two panels, a left and a right. The previous sec-
tion gives you the lowdown on figuring out how much fabric you need.)
 Appropriate curtain rods
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 Sewing machine, with appropriate color thread
Making your casement curtains
To create your casement curtains, follow these easy steps:
1. Cut your fabric into panels, using the measurements you’ve deter-
mined for your window.
2. Hem your panels, using a 1-inch seam allowance and employing the
fold-and-fold method of creating a hem.
To find out how to do the fold-and-fold method, please refer to the
arched valances project that we offer earlier in this chapter.
3. Fold the top and bottom of each panel back 1⁄2 inch and press with a
hot iron.
245
Chapter 14: Intermediate Window Treatments to Sink Your Needle Into

4. Fold the top and bottom back another 11⁄2 inches and press with a hot
iron.
5. Stitch along the top and bottom to create a rod sleeve (see
Figure 14-17).
6. Slide your sash or cafe rod through each sleeve and hang.
Double cafe curtains
Cafe curtains cover the lower half of a window. Used in restaurants and cafes,
they allow in light and still give the diner some privacy. They’re a wonderful
window treatment to try in your kitchen or family room. Traditionally, cafe
curtains are made of a light, informal fabric, such as eyelet, gingham, or lace,
but you can use any type of fabric you want.
The double cafe curtains (we call them “double” because there are two sets
of curtains) in this section provide privacy for home use but still give the
look of traditional cafe curtains. When the top part is pushed open, you get
plenty of light exposure for hanging plants.
Cafe curtains lend themselves to embellishment. You may want to try a fabric
with a decorative edge, such as lace or eyelet, for this project. We also love to
make this project in a simple fabric and then dress it up by stitching lace or
ribbon along the edges. (See Chapter 8 for more info on accessorizing.)
Getting your fabric measurements right
You can create the top part of your curtain set by making two different panels
that are a few inches longer than half the window length (to cover the rings of
the lower section). The bottom part is made from one panel.
Figure 14-17:
Making two
rod sleeves.
246
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

1. To determine your two top panel widths, measure across your window
adding an inch or two for your seam allowance and double this figure.
Each panel will equal your total window width to allow for adequate 
fullness.
2. For your top panel length, measure down from where you intend to
mount your rod and add 3 or 4 inches.
You want the top panel to take up about half of your window height.
3. For your bottom panel width, double your window measurement.
4. For your bottom panel length, measure from the middle sash or wher-
ever you plan to mount your middle rod and add an inch for your
bottom hem.
Our usual 30- x 60-inch window required two pieces of fabric that were each
31 x 34 inches for the top panels. For the bottom panel, use one wide piece of
fabric; ours measures 60 x 31 inches. This extra inch added to the 30-inch
measurement allows for a 1⁄2-inch hem allowance. To get the width you need,
try turning your fabric sideways.
Gathering your supplies
Get this gear together before you begin:
 A few yards of fabric (refer to the previous section for specifics on how
much you need)
 Rods (Figure 14-18 features tension rods) and curtain rings with clips to
allow the curtains to slide easily from one side to the other
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color thread
Creating your cafe curtains
These simple steps show you how to make your cafe curtains.
1. Cut your fabric to the appropriate dimensions for your window.
2. Using the fold-and-fold method of sewing, stitch around your three
panels to create hems.
Refer to the arched valances project that we offer earlier in this chapter
to find out how to do the fold-and-fold method.
The hem allowance is 1⁄2 inch.
3. Press your curtains with an iron.
4. Attach the curtain clips to the tops of your curtains and hang.
Use one clip every 5 inches. Figure 14-18 shows how the finished cur-
tains should look.

Chapter 14: Intermediate Window Treatments to Sink Your Needle Into

Crisscross curtains
Crisscross curtains are created from two panels that overlap and hang on two
rods that are the both the same size and which are mounted one in front of the
other. The panels are pulled to opposite sides and secured with tiebacks, and
above they overlap to create an interesting top. Choose a lightweight fabric,
such as chiffon or a polyester crepe, that flatters the billowy look of this treat-
ment. You can make this project as an inside mount or an outside mount —
either way looks great.
You need to purchase two rods called flat rods. To get this treatment to hang
properly, mount the rods one right in front of the other, so that they’re are as
close together as possible (see Figure 14-19). You can also use tension rods
for this treatment, one tension rod mounted right in front of the other. (A ten-
sion rod is an non-decorative, adjustable inside-mount rod that is secured
through — you guessed it — tension.)
Finagling the amount of needed fabric
To measure your width, double your window width. For your length, add 4
inches to your window measurement. For a 30- x 60-inch window, for exam-
ple, you need two panels that measure 60 x 64 inches.

Easy-Switch Style: Reversible 
Draperies with Tabs
Reversible draperies give your room two-for-one style that you can change,
depending on your mood or the day’s events. Having a cocktail party at
home? Show off the elegant damask side. Need a simple style for everyday
living? Flip them over to the lighter cotton side and you’re back to day-to-day
again. You get the picture.
Reversible draperies take a bit of extra effort to make, but it’s well worth it.
Getting two draperies in one, perhaps a spring look and a fall look, is an eco-
nomical and space-saving way to easily change your decor. (And if you have
sticky hands or muddy paws in your household, you can have a “good” side
for company and a “not-so-good” side for everyday use.)
Choosing the right color, weight, 
and amount of fabric
If you decide to go through the trouble of lining your draperies, you may as
well have two beautiful sides to show for your efforts. And you have plenty of
options for picking those sides.
Considering color
Complementary fabrics don’t necessarily mean light versus dark; you can
mix your prints. For example, try a striped fabric backed with a solid and a
vivid pattern (polka dots or small-print fabric) backed with a solid, or try two
patterned fabrics that refer to each other, such as a medium or large rose
print on one side backed with a small-patterned rose print on the reverse, or
wide stripes backed with thinner stripes. Keep the color tones (warm vs.
cool) of the two fabrics close when you choose this design option, and the
rest is up to you. The possibilities are truly endless!
Adding stand-out buttons is a nice opportunity to add some wit and charm to
your new creation. How about pearl buttons in the bedroom or leaf-shaped or
shell-shaped buttons in a bathroom? Big, bold-colored buttons in a child’s
room are sure to look great, too.
The draperies we discuss in this project have tabs on top with buttons,
which make switching the curtains back and forth easy.
252
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

Picking the perfect weights
You don’t want your fabrics to “fight” each other for attention (so to speak).
You want the fabrics to be of approximately the same weight, not only so the
treatment will hang properly, but also so that they are equally opaque. Also,
pick your fabric colors so that one dark color doesn’t shine through a light
one. To double-check, put your fabrics back to back and hold them up to the
window you intend to treat. Let the sun shine through to make sure you can’t
see one fabric print or color through the other, and then switch sides to make
sure the other side is sufficiently opaque, as well. For example, two cotton
twills are heavy enough not to allow the print or color on one side to show
through the other.
Calculating the right amount
To create this treatment, you will have to measure the height of your window,
then subtract 3 inches to get your finished treatment length. For example, if
your window is 60 inches high, your finished panel will be 57 inches.
The treatment width depends on the fullness you want. We recommend dou-
bling your window width; for example, if your window width is 30 inches wide,
plan on making two panels that are each 30 inches wide. You need approxi-
mately 3 yards per panel for a standard-size window, one that measures 30 x
60 inches. You actually need an extra inch to create a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance,
for a total of 31 inches wide x 58 inches long. (Refer to Chapter 6 for measur-
ing details.)
In addition to the fabric needed to create the panels, use a piece of fabric that
measures about 20 x 6 inches to create your tabs (they hold your drapes onto
the curtain rods). To determine the amount of tabs you’ll need, measure the
width of your window and divide by 5; that way you’ll be adding one tab for
every 5 inches of width. Be sure to add one at each end so that your treat-
ment hangs well.
For your tiebacks, you’ll need a piece of fabric measuring 36 x 10 inches to
create two tiebacks.
Gathering your supplies
After you have the right fabric, you need to assemble the following supplies:
 Two colors of heavyweight thread (See Chapter 4 regarding use of this
type of thread.)
You need one color that matches one fabric and one that matches the
other.
253
Chapter 15: Gearing Up for More Ambitious Window Treatment Projects

 Two types of buttons
One button type needs to match (or contrast appropriately with) one side
and another button type has to match the other side. You need enough
buttons to place one on each side every 5 inches. For a 30-inch-wide
window, for example, you need seven for each side, for a total of 14.
 A plain cafe rod or tension rod to hang your drapes
A cafe rod is a decorative rod used with rings, and a tension rod hides
underneath treatment fabric to provide an inside mount; see Chapter 4
for more.
 An iron and ironing board
 Needle and thread (for hand sewing)
 Scissors
 Sewing machine
 Straight pins
Tips for sewing success
To make reversible draperies, you need to sew fabric onto fabric, and some
unique challenges come with this kind of sewing. Following are a few tips to
help you:
 Make sure you measure your fabrics exactly. Since you have to add
tabs, calculating the length correctly will give you the look you really
want.
 Press your fabrics, so they remain flat and smooth while you sew
them together. (Actually, we recommend that you press your fabric
before beginning any project, but doing so is especially important for
this one.)
 If you’re using a printed fabric, keep the fabric “straight,” that is,
draped so that it hangs in a visually pleasing way. For example, if
you’re using a fabric with a rooster motif, make sure that the rooster’s
head is facing north in the pattern, not crooked or sideways (unless you
like swimming roosters).
 To keep your reversible fabrics securely together, consider using a
safety pin in the middle of the fabric. The pin will also help your fabric
stay flat as you move it through the sewing machine.
 When sewing fabric on fabric, move your fabrics slowly, consistently,
and smoothly through your sewing machine so you don’t end up with
gaps or buckles.
254
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

Starting on your reversible draperies
To create your reversible draperies, follow these steps:
1. Lay out your fabric on your cutting table or workspace.
2. Cut your tab fabric, as many as you need for your window’s width.
You need tabs that are 8 inches long x 11⁄2 inches wide when finished. Cut
your fabric so they measure 9 x 21⁄2-inches, to allow for a 1⁄2-inch seam
allowance all around the tabs.
3. Sew your curtain tabs by laying your two pieces of fabric face to 
face and stitching a 1⁄2-inch around your tab, leaving the bottom part
open (so that you can turn it right side out when you’re finished; see
Figure 15-1).
After you sew, cut off the top (non-open) corners of the tabs on a diago-
nal so that when you flip the piece, the fabric lays flat, and you have
“perfect” corners.
4. Turn the tabs right side out and press with an iron.
5. Create buttonholes on the tabs 1⁄2 inch from the finished edge.
Size your buttonholes appropriately for the button you want (see Sewing
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, if you need additional info on sewing button-
holes).

6. Cut both panels of your drapery fabric to the appropriate 
measurements.
(For a 30-inch-wide window, each panel needs to be 8 feet, 1 x 31 inches.)
7. Before you lay the two fabrics face-to-face, right sides together, pin the
tabs on the top seam at 5-inch intervals, leaving 1⁄2 inch at both sides
of the drapery, so that the tabs are sandwiched between the two
panels of fabric (see Figure 15-2).
When the drapery is turned right side out, the top seam holds the tabs
in place.
For reversible draperies, make sure that each piece of fabric you sew is
exactly the same size. Otherwise, your fabric will peak through. Measure
your two pieces of fabric using the same tape measure and lay them
back to back, smoothing them out on your worktable to check to see if
they’re equal. (For more info on measuring, see Chapter 6.)
Spend a few minutes figuring out how you’ll attach your tabs to get the
effect you want. When you flip your tabs, do you want them to match
the panel underneath, or would you prefer another color fabric under-
neath for contrast? Most people want to reverse the color of the tabs so
when they’re flipped over for buttoning, they match the drapery fabric
beneath them, but it’s up to you to decide.
8. Pin along the edge, all the way around the panels, using a pin every 5
inches or so.
9. Prepare your sewing machine and sew all around the panels, leaving
an 8-inch hole toward the top on the left-hand side (so you can later
pull the draperies right side out).
Remove your pins as you work.
10. Cut off the excess fabric at the corner of the panel on a diagonal, just
as you did with your tabs, so you’ll have “perfect” corners.
11. Flip the drapery right side out and press with your iron.

You can sew through the buttons on one side to the buttons on the
other to save time and make them sturdier and more secure. Make sure
the buttons are spaced properly to match the tab placement.
13. Iron all around the edges of the draperies, making sure to push 
the fabric of the 8-inch-hole seam allowance inside the panel (see
Figure 15-3).
14. Hand stitch the hole closed with a blind stitch.
A blind stitch is a way of hiding thread so that it doesn’t show. Make sure
to pull your thread under the fabric, only allowing tiny bits of it to be
exposed while stitching.
15. Flip your tabs over, button them, and hang your new draperies!
Making tiebacks to show off both fabrics
Tiebacks are a device that hold your curtains back, allowing the sun in and
affording you a view through your window. In this project, we include some
cloth tiebacks, which pull back your curtains and also allow you and your
guests to peak at the underside of your drapery. For more on tiebacks, see
Chapter 8.

Chapter 15: Gearing Up for More Ambitious Window Treatment Projects

To make your tiebacks:
1. Cut your fabric as you would the tabs in the reversible draperies with
tabs project, but make them twice as long and remember to allow for
the 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
You’ll need a piece of fabric measuring 36 x 10 inches to create two
tiebacks. You can use the same two fabrics you used for each side of
your draperies, or go for a contrasting look with one or two different fab-
rics altogether.
2. Sew the tiebacks the same way as you did your tabs in the previous
project.
3. Reverse the panel to the right side out and close the ends with a hand
stitch.
Tab-panel curtains use a plain cafe rod or a tension rod. You want the focal
point to be the buttons, so keep it simple.
To attach the tiebacks to the wall, add a cup hook, screw hook, or a decora-
tive knob to the wall, and attach your tiebacks, either with plastic rings (sew
a plastic ring on the two ends of each tieback), or by hand sewing a loop of
thread on the ends of each tieback.
Weatherproofing Your Home: 
Lined Draperies
Depending on where you live and how many seasonal changes your home
endures, you may want to give your windows a little extra insulation. An
extra-thick curtain or a curtain lined with cotton duck can shield your home
against cold or wet weather and protect you and your furniture from exces-
sive sun and heat.
Cotton duck works well for a lining because
 It’s white, so it doesn’t bleach out.
 It’s heavy, so it gives weight to your drapes.
 It’s thick enough not to allow light through.
 It’s also dense enough to keep wind and cold air trapped behind it.
258
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

Although cotton duck has many advantages compared to other fabrics, it’s a
bit harder to work with, because its consistency is somewhat less flexible,
such as that of thin cotton fabric. However, cotton duck is well worth the
added effort and the lower energy bill.
If you use a thicker fabric like cotton duck for your liner, you may need to
change your sewing machine needle. Do a test run on your regular needle to
determine if your machine can handle the thicker fabric, and get the appro-
priate type of needle if it can’t (see our list of needle gauges in Chapter 4). If
you do a test run, you don’t have to waste valuable time by starting and stop-
ping in the middle of your project to fix any problems. We like Singer heavy-
duty needles for heavyweight fabrics.
Figuring your fabric needs
The fabric’s drapery side folds over the lining side, so you need more drap-
ery fabric than lining fabric.
To figure out how much drape fabric you need, measure your window, then
add additional width and length to allow for the folding you’ll need to do: For
a window measuring 30 x 60 inches, the drapery-side fabric folds over the
lining side, so you’re going to need to make your drapery-side fabric 5 inches
wider than your panel and 7 inches longer.
Your lining-side fabric needs to be 4 inches slimmer than your desired finished
panel width and 6 inches shorter. The formula we use is 11⁄2 times the width
measurement, and the length is the actual measurement of window, from trim
to trim. If your panel is 45 inches wide and 60 inches long, for example, your
lining-side fabric needs to be 41 inches wide and 54 inches long.
Be sure to allow for a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance in your measurements so that
you’ll have enough fabric to create a clean edge.
Getting your gear together
Gather up the following to make your lined draperies:
 Your drape fabric and your lining fabric
Use white cotton duck for the lining fabric, and a fabric similar to cotton
duck, such as a plain cotton or cotton/rayon blend fabric, for the drap-
ery fabric.
259
Chapter 15: Gearing Up for More Ambitious Window Treatment Projects

If you’re working with a fabric that could benefit from a lining fabric that
will add weight, consider using a polyester taffeta.
 About 10 clip rings or sew-on rings with eyes (or one every 5 inches)
 An iron and ironing board
 Needle and thread (for hand sewing)
 Scissors
 Sewing machine, with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins
Starting your lined drapes
1. Lay out your drapery fabric on your cutting table or workspace and
center your lining fabric, face to face, on top of your drapery fabric.
You have extra drapery fabric — 61⁄2 inches on the top and bottom and
41⁄2 inches on the right and left sides. (The 1⁄2 inches take into account the
seam allowance.)
2. Fold the drapery fabric over the lining, as in Figure 15-4, press the
fabric seam allowance in, and sew the two side seams, so that they
resemble the fabric in the figure.
Be sure to leave an 8-inch opening on one side so you can pull the
draperies right side out later.
Figure 15-4:

3. Pin the bottom-center edge of the drapery-side fabric to the bottom-
center edge of the lining-side fabric.
4. Sew the bottom seam, starting in the center, sewing out left and right
toward the side seams.
Do the same for the top.
5. Trim the four flaps that have been created in the corners of the drap-
ery, so that you have a small amount of fabric left (see Figure 15-5).
6. Pull your entire drapery right side out through the 8-inch hole on the
side.
7. Tuck in the excess corner fabric into each corner and press flat with
an iron.
8. Hand tack your 8-inch hole and four corners (see Figure 15-6).

9. Press your entire drapery flat with an iron.
10. Attach the rings.
Clip on your rings, or if you’re using rings with eyes, sew them on. Using
a matching heavy-duty thread, hand sew a ring every 5 inches, starting
at the edge. (For more information on making your ring choice, see
Chapter 4.)
Seriously Swank: Fabulous Swags
Swag curtains hang in graceful loops or curves over a decorative rod to
create full, elegant window styles that signal luxury. A must for formal rooms
like living and dining rooms, swag curtains also work well in bedrooms (best
when teamed with a shade to block sun) for a romantic look.
When planning your swag design, keep an idea in your head of what curtain
rod you want to use, because it’s part of your featured design element. We
recommend cafe rods that complement the fabric or overall motif of your
treatment.
In this section we show you the simplest way to get classic swags without all
the difficulty. If you need a quick primer on gathering, however, see Sewing
For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
Picking gorgeous swag fabrics
You want to put a bit of thought into the fabrics you choose for swags. Make
sure you select a fabric that not only has a nice draping quality, but also is
heavy enough to keep its folds.
Avoid fabrics with one-way patterns (say, for example, a row of ducks or a
swirl of hearts). They’re difficult to match up because the pattern runs in a
different direction. Solids or small patterns work best. Petite florals are a
good choice, or if you’re confident that you can match them up, wide stripes
can give a bold and stunning look.
Lined up and ready: One-piece 
swag and cascade
The genius of this swag is it lines itself. No matter how you turn it to create
folds, the swag looks great because both sides are made of the same fabric.
For this project, we used two panels that we sewed into one swag. We treated
262
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

a 30 x 60-inch window with five 45-inch-square pieces of fabric. You can
adjust the length of your swag (or have the cascade descend farther down
your window) to fit a larger window by adding additional 45-inch-squares of
fabric as needed.
Collecting your supplies
Before you begin, gather these supplies:
 Five pieces of 45 x 45-square-inch fabric; we needed 61⁄2 yards of 45-inch-
wide fabric to create these
 Swag holders or a fancy curtain rod (one that flatters your décor, and
with decorative finials and matching brackets, all of which will be 
showing)
 Iron and ironing board
 Needle and thread (for hand sewing)
 Scissors
 Sewing machine, with appropriate color thread
 Straight pins
Making the swag
To create your swag, follow these steps:
1. Lay out your fabric on your cutting table or workspace and cut five 
45 x 45-inch squares from your fabric (see Figure 15-7).
45 inches

Figure 15-7:
Cutting your

263
Chapter 15: Gearing Up for More Ambitious Window Treatment Projects

2. Cut each of these five squares in half diagonally (that is, on the bias)
to create ten triangles of fabric (shown also in Figure 15-7).
3. Stitch straight edge to straight edge (that is, the right-angle edges
formed by cutting on the bias) so that your five triangles create one
long bias-cut panel (see Figure 15-8).
Repeat the straight-edge stitching with the remaining five triangle
pieces. You now have two matching panels.
4. Press the seams open and flat on both panels.
5. Lay the right sides of the two panels together so that the seams are
exposed on both sides and pin all around every 6 inches, matching all
sides.
6. Using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, stitch all the way around the panels,
leaving an 8-inch hole.
This step can take a while, so be patient. Your two panels are now one
panel.
7. Turn the drapery right side out and press.
8. With your sewing machine, carefully close the 8-inch hole.
9. Find the center of your finished panel and using our illustration as a
guide, drape it over your rod. Keep in mind the red stripe that winds
around a candy cane as you work and you’ll get the desired effect.
Figure 15-8:
Creating
your panels.
264
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

The points of the cascade will hang down 60 inches. Make sure that the
longer points of the cascade are on the outside of the window you’re
covering.
10. Secure your swag on the rod by pinning your folds in the position you
want and hand tacking them in position.
Work underneath your curtain rod and on the back of the swag to keep
the pins in place.
Super swag: Double swag drapes
This swag window treatment blocks less light because it’s gathered in the
center. You can add semi-opaque draperies underneath if you’re using it in a
bedroom. If you want, you can add an extra flourish in the center, with a
fabric flower or bow.
To make a double swag, simply follow the instructions in the previous sec-
tion, through Step 9. The materials are identical. Then before you tack your
cascade to the swag:
1. Chalk a line up the center of your swag on the back side (see 
Figure 15-9).
2. With your gathering foot attachment on your sewing machine, gather
6 inches in the center of the panel, as show in Figure 15-10.
3. Place the swag and cascade on your curtain rod and secure the center
of the swag to the curtain rod with a ribbon or tie (see Figure 15-11).
4. Continue with Step 10 in the previous section.

Fear Not: Stitched Pleats Made Easy
Stitched pleats add a flat plushiness to the top of your window treatment, but
also maintain a managed, structured fullness at the bottom. They’re great for
a room where you don’t want so much billowy fabric represented in the
bottom half of your room.
Many stitched-pleated draperies can be challenging because they require
quite a lot of hand sewing. You have nothing to fear, however, because we
offer a style that gives you the look of beautiful pleated curtains without all
that time-consuming hand sewing. You do all the work on a sewing machine,
and the hardware isn’t complicated to use.
When making stitched-pleated draperies, several steps are vital to keeping
the pleats consistent. You want to make sure you get the following correct
the first time around:
 Measuring the fabric is important for creating consistent pleats. If you
don’t measure consistently, then your pleats will not be even.
 Back stitching, or back tacking, at the end of your stitching is essen-
tial. If you don’t back stitch, then the pleats may not keep their shape
well.
Back stitching means going back over the end to reinforce the area. For 
a more detailed discussion of this topic, see Sewing For Dummies, 2nd
Edition.

Figure 15-10:

266
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

 Pinning consistently is also important in keeping the pleats even. If
you don’t pin consistently, you won’t be able to get the pleats’ shape
right.
Getting the right amount of fabric
To determine the fabric needs for this project, double your window width
and add 2 inches for a 1-inch seam allowance on both sides. To figure your
length, measure from the top of your rod down to where you want treatment
to end, and add 61⁄2 inches.
For a 30 x 60-inch panel, you need a piece of fabric that is 62 x 661⁄2 inches.
Using this size of fabric allows for a 21⁄2-inch hem on the bottom and 4 inches
to fold over on the top to create your rod sleeve.
Gathering your materials
Before you jump head over heals into your project, make sure you gather
these materials:
 Enough drapery fabric for your window
(Refer to the previous section to figure out how much is enough.) The
best types of fabric for this treatment are lightweight to mediumweight
cottons, silks, or polyester taffetas.
 Chalk and a ruler
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color thread
 Straight pins
Stitching your way to pleated curtains
This project uses 3-inch pleats, so you only have to sew a total of five pleats!
Just follow these easy steps:
1. Hem the side seams and the bottom of your panel.
You have a 1-inch seam allowance on each side or your panel. To create
the side seams, press the fabric 1⁄2 inch and fold in another 1⁄2 inch,
sewing along the edge. For the bottom, press 1⁄2 inch up, fold 2 inches 
up, and then stitch. Keep your top edge unfinished for now.
267
Chapter 15: Gearing Up for More Ambitious Window Treatment Projects

2. Mark your pleats across the top with the chalk.
Starting from the left-hand seam on the front of the fabric, measure 5
inches from the side seam and make an 8-inch parallel line (see Figure
15-12). Then from that measurement, measure 6 inches in and draw
another parallel line.
Repeat these alternating 5-inch and 6-inch measurements until you reach
the right-hand seam.
3. Using the numbers on Figure 15-12, pin line 1 to line 2, line 3 to line 4,
and so on, and then sew down 8 inches (see Figure 15-13).
4. Press all the pleats flat with an iron, creating a 3-inch pleat, so that
the seam is behind the exact center of the pleat.
5. Pin your pleats so they measure 8 inches, and top stitch 8 inches
down on both sides of each pleat, making sure to back tack at the
bottom.

As you proceed, be sure to pull excess threads to the back of the curtain
for a neater finish. (You can easily accomplish this step by tugging lightly
on the bobbin thread so that the top thread goes through to the back.)
6. Fold 1⁄2 inch of the top edge toward the back and press.
7. Fold another 31⁄2 inches toward the back and sew across your pleated
panel to create your rod sleeve (see Figure 15-14).
In Charm’s Way: Making 
Shades for All Seasons
This section includes two shade projects that are a nice alternative to cur-
tains and draperies. They’re a step up from plain pull-down shades, and the
results are worth the extra effort. These complicated-looking, but easy-to-
make, shades pack plenty of charm without overwhelming a small space,
such as a bathroom or walk-in closet. They’re also nice in a more masculine
room, like a study, den, or men’s workspace.
Don’t be intimidated by the nails, screws, and boards — these two projects
are simple!
Classic style: Rendering Roman shades
Do you want to include your tool-belted partner in on the style act? This pro-
ject is perfect for you and your design-challenged significant other, who will
surely enjoy flexing traditionally labeled “men’s skills” of light carpentry,
regardless of gender.
Figure 15-14:

269
Chapter 15: Gearing Up for More Ambitious Window Treatment Projects

Roman shades pull up in sections with the help of traverse cord or Roman
shade cord (both available at a crafts store). Roman shades look elegant and
streamlined in either the up or down position.
You’ve probably seen Roman shades featured in window treatment catalogs,
and they start at $65 or $75 each. This project is our take on a Roman shade
without most of the characteristic hassle (and for much less of the cost). We
focus this project for an outside-mounted Roman shade (which is much
easier to hang than an inside mount). Note: This shade mounts above the top
of the trim mold and descends to the windowsill (see Chapter 6 for a helpful
explanatory figure if you’re unsure of these terms), so keep this in mind when
planning and measuring.
Supplies galore
You need the following supplies to make these shades:
 A piece of fabric that is about 4 inches wider than your window, and 16
inches longer
For our 30 x 60-inch window, we used 21⁄2 yards of 45-inch-wide fabric.
Look for a fabric of a medium- or heavyweight, such as a heavy cotton
duck or brocade
 7 yards of traverse cord or Roman shade cord
You’ll need to divide your cord in two. One piece should measure the
height of your window plus the top length plus a few inches, because
you’ll be threading that piece of cord up the left side and over the top to
meet the other cord on the top right side of the shade. The other piece
should measure the height of your window, plus a few inches.
 Five 30-inch wooden dowels
 One piece of 1 x 2-inch wood
The length of the wood needs to be the same as your window’s width, so
for a 30-inch-wide window, use a piece of wood that’s 30 inches long.
 141⁄4-inch screw eyes
 Chalk
 1 cleat (Not to be confused with the cleats you use during soccer; it’s
just a metal device for tying up your shade cord.)
 Hammer and screwdriver
 Iron and ironing board
 Screws or nails (for attaching the shade)
 Sewing machine and appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Staple gun with 3⁄8-inch staples
270
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

You can find the 1 x 2-inch wood and wooden dowels measured and cut to
order at most hardware stores or home improvement stores. Most crafts
shops also carry them, as well as the cord and staple gun. You can find the
window cleat at any crafts store.
The to-do list
To create your shades, follow these simple steps:
1. Cut your fabric to the appropriate size (refer to the previous section).
For a 30 x 60-inch window, use a 32 x 76-inch piece of fabric.
2. Hem the sides of your shade fabric by pressing the fabric on each 
side 1⁄2 inch and folding in another 1⁄2 inch, and then sewing along 
the edges.
3. Hem the bottom of your shade by pressing the fabric 1⁄2 inch and fold-
ing up 2 inches, and then sewing along the edge.
4. From the bottom finished hem of your shade fabric, chalk a line
across the front; measure up 10 inches and mark, and then measure
another 2 inches and mark again (these create your sleeves).
Continue in this way to the top (see Figure 15-15).
You have five sets of lines that are 2 inches apart.

5. With your sewing machine, stitch the lines that are 2 inches apart
together, creating small sleeves in the back of your shade (refer to
Figure 15-15).
You insert your dowels in these small sleeves.
6. With a hammer and nails or screws, attach your 1 x 2 board above
your window.
On the underside of the board, attach four screw eyes, allowing for 
10 inches between each one, regardless of your window size (see 
Figure 15-16).
7. Using your staple gun, attach the top of your shade to the top of the
30-inch board.
Make sure that you fold the fabric under at the top, and check that the
shade reaches the bottom of your window (see Figure 15-17).
8. Attach your screw eyes to the end of each dowel.
9. Insert the dowels into each sleeve.
10. On the left side of your shade, starting at the bottom, tie a knot with
your cord, and weave the cord through the screw eye in the bottom
dowel.
Thread it up through the four screw eyes above it and through the screw
eye at the bottom of the mounted board above, bringing the cord to the
right side.

right side and knot well (see Figure 15-18).
12. Now attach the cleat to the wall on the right-hand side of the shade so
that when you draw the Roman shades, you can wrap the cords
around the cleat to keep it in place.

London calling: London 
shades with ribbons
Not many window treatments are more glamorous than a London shade.
London shades look a bit like the balloon valance from Chapter 14, but
they’re more utilitarian. They have the same shirred, puffed look when the
ribbon is pulled up to make the shade ascend. Perfect for the bedroom, living
room, or dining room, you can really go to town with a contrasting ribbon for
a dramatic look.
The shopping list
We designed these shades for our standard 30-inch-wide window, but you can
adjust the measurements to treat any size window. Like the Roman shade,
they mount above your window, so keep that in mind when planning and
measuring.
You need the following supplies to make one London shade:
 Medium- or heavyweight fabric
You need the proper amount of yardage based on the size of your
window. Cut it to the size of your window, plus an additional 10 inches
for the width and 5 inches for the length.
For a 30 x 60-inch window, use 2 yards of 45-inch-wide fabric cut to make
one 40 x 65-inch piece.
 1 piece of 1 x 2-inch wood
The length of the wood needs to be the same as your window’s width.
So, for instance, with a 30-inch-wide window, use a 30-inch-long piece of
wood.
 Four pieces of durable ribbon, each 2 yards long
If the dimensions of your window are larger than our standard 30 x 60,
add 1 foot of ribbon per foot longer.
 Chalk
 Iron and ironing board
 Screwdriver or hammer
 Screws or nails (for attaching the shade)
 Sewing machine and appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Staple gun with 3⁄8-inch staples
274

Getting to work
Follow these instructions to make your London shade:
1. Hem the sides of your London shade fabric by pressing the fabric on
each side 1⁄2 inch and folding in another 1⁄2 inch, and then sewing along
the edges.
2. Hem the bottom of your London shade fabric by pressing and then
stitching the fabric.
3. Measure and chalk vertical lines on the back of your shade fabric,
using Figure 15-19 as a guide.
4. Stitch the lines that are 2 inches apart together, making four sleeves
on the back of your shade, using Figure 15-20 as a guide.
5. Attach the 1 x 2-inch board to the wall above your window and
casing, using screws or nails.
6. Thread a piece of ribbon through one sleeve, letting it hang out from
the bottom of your London shade.
Do the same for each sleeve.
7. Attach the ribbon to the top of your shade by hand sewing or with
your sewing machine.

Dollars and cents: A sample budget
To make a great-looking London shade with
ribbon, you don’t need a lot of money. We esti-
mate that it costs about $41 to $71, which also
includes the cost of a good-quality lightweight
staple gun (which you can use over and over on
other projects). The cost can vary, depending on
how fancy you want to get with the fabric.
Here’s how we figure it:
 21⁄2 yards of fabric, preferably a medium- or
heavyweight, such as a heavy cotton duck
or brocade: anywhere from $15 to $45,
depending on how much you want to spend
 8 yards of durable ribbon: about $1 a yard:
about $8
 Five 30-inch wooden dowels: about 99
cents each: $5
 One 30-inch-long piece of 1 x 2-inch wood:
about $2
 A piece of chalk: 25 cents
 1 cleat: 50 cents
 Heavy-duty thread: $1
 Screws or nails (for attaching the shade):
about $1.69 at any hardware store
 141⁄4-inch screw eyes: about $3
 Staple gun with 3/8-inch staples: about $12
for a lightweight one

machine to make some lovely unadorned slipcovers that are sure to
please. Here’s the skinny on making easy sewn slipcovers: We remove the
fuss and trouble to make these projects as easy and pain-free as possible.
In this chapter, we show you how to sew a slipcover for a loveseat or sofa.
Then we tackle how to whip up easy slipcovers for your dining room chairs
and armchairs. We also show you easy ways to add some style to ottomans,
vanity stools, and, if you’re so inclined, your old washing machine.
Before You Get Started . . .
Following are some general pointers for sewn slipcovers. Check these out
before you get started, and hopefully you’ll save yourself some grief:
 When making slipcovers, take a look at our slipcover-measuring chapter,
Chapter 10, before you start a project in this chapter. 
 The biggest sewing challenge you’ll face when making slipcovers will
be how to manage the large amount of fabric you have to maneuver
through the sewing machine. Don’t despair. We’re here to help. Place
your sewing machine on a large worktable so you can spread the fabric
out, or have a card table adjacent to your sewing machine so your fabric
has a safe landing area. Work slowly and surely, and you can to easily

manage the large pieces of fabric. Sew your longest seams first, because
they have the most pins in the fabric. Doing so prevents your pins from
sticking into adjacent pieces of fabric, thus slowing you down as you
work.
 We use a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance for these projects, but if you want to
give yourself a bit of wiggle room — which never hurts — then try a 1-
inch seam allowance. If, after fitting the whole slipcover, you realize that
your initial estimate is a bit snug, take out your 1-inch seam allowance
and switch to a 1⁄2-inch. Some beginners also find it easier to move fabric
through the machine if the seam allowance is a bit bigger. The amount of
your seam allowance is up to you; if you use heavy-duty thread, a 1⁄2-inch
seam allowance should be fine for holding your creation together.
 Fitting your slipcover as you sew pieces on may be very helpful in
obtaining a good fit. If you’re unsure at any step whether you calculated
correctly, put the slipcover back on the furniture to check for fit.
Slipcovering Sofas and Chairs
We give you “just the facts, ma’am” so you can concentrate on getting these
slipcovers to fit perfectly. You can dress up your creation with embellishments
(see Chapter 12 for more), or go to Chapter 17, where you can discover how to
add piping, zippers to cushion covers, or a pleated skirt to a basic furniture
slipcover.
Striking sofas and loveseats
One challenge of sewing sofa and loveseat slipcovers is patiently following
each step. Another challenge is handling the seemingly huge amount of
fabric. However, we think these two challenges are easier (and cheaper) to
handle than shopping for and carrying in a new sofa. Work slowly and care-
fully, and you can’t go wrong.
This first slipcover project focuses on the sofa style most people have: a
square back or slightly rounded back with square or slightly rounded arms.
The slipcover extends to the floor and covers the sofa’s back. When selecting
a fabric for this slipcover, we recommend a strong fabric with a tight weave
so it conforms to your sofa and keeps its shape. A few good examples are
heavy cottons like denims and cotton ducks or brocades (see Chapter 2 for
more on slipcover fabric).
We recommend you always use heavy-duty thread in your sewing machine for
these projects, which helps with the daily wear and tear slipcovers endure.

Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

If you first want to make your pattern in muslin to test your slipcover-making
skills, refer to Chapter 13.
Measuring your fabric needs
For a standard-size square-shaped (not T-back) sofa — one that measures 88
x 37 inches — use about 10 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric. Sewing two widths of
60-inch-wide fabric side by side gives you enough width for an 89-inch-wide
sofa. This slipcover goes over the tops of the cushions, so you don’t need any
extra fabric to cover them individually.
To determine yardage, take a look at Chapter 10, where we offer you a few
choices to figure out how much fabric you’ll need for your particular style of
furniture.
If you’re worried that you may need a bit of “wiggle room” when creating a slip-
cover for an unusually shaped sofa, or you’re planning on adding tuck-ins —
edging a bit of fabric into the crevices and grooves of your sofa’s cushions —
you can add 3⁄4 inch to each measurement. Sew along the 1⁄2-inch measurement,
which gives you an extra 1⁄4 inch on each seam (for more on tuck-ins, see
Chapter 10).
To get your measured pieces accurate, measure each piece across its broad-
est dimension so you get enough coverage. Doing so is especially important if
the top of your sofa is wider than the bottom. Some of your measurements
need to accommodate tapering (taking fabric in for narrower furniture dimen-
sions). If you take the widest area into account before you cut, you’ll have
plenty of fabric. Later when you pin the pieces in place, you can refine the
contours so each piece fits together properly.
Getting it all together
Before you start, gather the following supplies:
 About 10 yards of fabric
We recommend you use a solid-color fabric, or a small print so that you
don’t have to match repeats. For information on fabrics, refer to Chap-
ter 2, and for info on matching patterns across fabric widths, check out
Chapter 10.
 Chalk
 Cloth measuring tape
 Iron and ironing board
 Notepad and pencil (A pad and pencil are great for writing down your
measurements.)
 Scissors

 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins
Measuring the individual pieces
After you’ve measured your total fabric, you need to focus on measuring your
sofa for the individual pieces of your slipcover. Follow these simple steps:
1. Iron all your fabric well, so it’s flat and smooth when you measure it
and later when you’re ready to cut it.
2. With your measuring tape, measure the back of the sofa from the top
to the floor (including your sofa’s legs), as in Figure 16-1.
Grab your notepad and pencil to record the measurements, adding
2 inches to the width and length measurements (for the 1-inch seam
allowance when you sew).
3. Measure the backrest as shown in Figure 16-2.
Record your measurements, making sure to add your desired seam
allowance.

4. Measure the seat area, starting where it meets the back of the sofa,
to the front and then down to the floor at the front of the sofa (see
Figure 16-3).
Record your measurements, making sure to add your desired seam
allowance.
5. Measure the front of the armrest, from the top edge to the floor, as
shown in Figure 16-4.
Write down these measurements twice, because you need to cut two of
these pieces (your sofa does have two arms, right?). Be sure to add your
desired seam allowance to every measurement.
6. Measure the side of the sofa, including the armrest side, as shown in
Figure 16-5.
Record these measurements twice, because you need to cut two of these
pieces — one for each arm. Be sure to add your desired seam allowance
to every measurement.
7. Measure the inside of the armrest, up to where it meets the side of
the sofa.

Chapter 16: All in a Day’s Work! Intermediate Slipcover Projects

Take a look at Figure 16-6 to see what we call the inside armrest area. Be
sure to add your desired seam allowance. Record these measurements
twice, because you need to cut two of these pieces.
Cutting your slipcover pieces
Keep your seam allowance lines in mind when you’re cutting your pieces.
Note the locations of the chalked inner line and the outer line, and be sure
the lines extend clearly and evenly all around the piece.
Now you’re ready to cut your pieces along the outer line.
Assembling your slipcover
1. Lay all the pieces of fabric you’ve cut so they’re facedown (wrong side
out) on the sofa.
You can use some straight pins to attach them directly to the sofa,
which keeps them temporarily in place.
2. With your straight pins, begin pinning all the pieces to one another,
along the 1-inch seam allowance (see Figure 16-7). Don’t pin too
tightly or you won’t be able to remove the slipcover.
You start to see your slipcover “come to life,” albeit inside out!

3. Keeping all pinned pieces attached, carefully remove the pinned fabric
from the sofa, prepare your sewing machine with heavy-duty thread,
and start sewing the pieces together, allowing for your seam allowance.
If you’re having a hard time removing the fabric from your sofa, first
check to make sure that you didn’t pin it directly to the cushion under-
neath. If pins aren’t the problem, your slipcover is too tight, and you
need to move the pins in the back to create more room. Move your pins
1⁄4 inch at a time, making sure to be consistent on each side, until the slip-
cover comes off easily.
4. Sew along the marked chalk lines (the chalked line you drew before
allowing for your 1-inch seam allowance).
Start with the largest pieces, and then moving down in size to the
smaller pieces, sew your fabric together. Be sure to remove your pins as
you go. Press your seams open as you work, and now is also a good time
to clip the corners of your sewn fabric at a 45-degree angle to remove
excess fabric from the underside of your slipcover, which helps the slip-
cover lie smoothly on your sofa.
5. Fit your slipcover back on your sofa to check for the fit, and you’re
done!
If you find that your fit isn’t quite right, take out a corner seam in the
back and see if using a bit less seam allowance makes it fit better.
The sofa we covered was shaped like a giant box, enabling us to easily slip
the slipcover on and off. If you’re working with a sofa whose circumference is
larger on top than on the bottom, consider adding two zippers at the back
corner seams, extending from the highest point of the sofa to the floor. They
don’t have to be sewn in perfectly because nobody will see them in the back.
They just have to be securely sewn and, of course, functional. (See Chapter 17
for more on adding zippers.)

Armchairs aimed to please
Covering up a comfy old armchair that feels great but doesn’t look so hot any-
more is a great alternative to going out and buying a stiff, new-looking one.
This armchair slipcover is easy to make. To figure out your fabric needs, mea-
sure the width of the entire chair (from the floor on the left side up and over
the cushion to the floor on the right) and the depth of the entire chair (from
the front of the floor, over the cushion, up and down the back to the floor).
Our armchair is of average size, and we needed 3 yards of 105-inch-wide
fabric. If you can’t find a 105-inch-wide fabric that you like, you can sew two
60-inch-wide pieces of fabric together (or three 45-inch-wide pieces) to create
one piece of fabric large enough to cover the whole chair. In this case, use 4 to
6 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric or 8 to 10 yards of 45-inch-wide fabric. Check out
Chapter 10 for more information on measuring and figuring out total fabric.
Another alternative to 105-inch-wide fabric is to sew a queen-size flat sheet to
a matching twin-size flat sheet (see Chapter 2 for more on cheating with
sheets). Combined, these sheets give you ample fabric.
Simply follow the same steps as the sofa/loveseat project in the previous 
section.
Dazzling dining room chairs
Most dining room chairs have the same general shape, so you can apply our
method of covering almost every style chair. Be sure to take your time to
carefully measure.
When choosing fabric, pick one that has a bit of stiffness to it but that still
drapes well over the chair back. Brocade and damask are good examples.
Take a look at Chapter 2 for more recommendations.

Dollars and cents: A sample budget
To make a basic but elegant sofa slipcover, you
don’t have to take out another mortgage on your
home. We estimate that it costs about $84,
which includes the cost of a box of straight pins
that you can use over and over on other pro-
jects. The cost increases or decreases, depend-
ing on how elaborate you want to get with the
fabric. Here’s how we figure it:
 10 yards of cotton twill: $8 per yard or $80
total
 Matching heavy-duty thread: $2
 Box of straight pins: $2

This slipcover covers the entire chair, from the top of the chair back to the
floor. It consists of two pieces of overlapping fabric that you sew together.
Getting a snug but not-too-snug fit can be a challenge. If this project is your
first time creating a slipcover for a chair, note our hints in Steps 8 and 9 (in
“Making your slipcover,” later in this chapter) on adjusting the pinned fabric
at the chair’s lower rear section to allow for a bit of wiggle room before you
cut and sew.
Finagling fabric needs
After you select your fabric, determine how much fabric you need for your
chair. Follow these quick steps:
1. Start at the back of your chair and measure from the floor up to the
top, and then over the top and down to the seat (see Figure 16-8).
For our chair, the measurement was 46 inches.
2. Measure from the back of the seat to the floor in front of the chair
(again, refer to Figure 16-8).
Our measurement was 34 inches.
3. Add the two measurements together and convert to yards.
To convert from inches to yards, remember that 12 inches is a foot, and
there are 3 feet in a yard; to get a yard, divide by 36, divide by 12 inches
to get a foot.

Chapter 16: All in a Day’s Work! Intermediate Slipcover Projects

With our chair, we measured 80 inches, so after converting inches to
yards, we needed a total of 21⁄2 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric to create the
slipcover.
Gathering your supplies
Before you start, collect the following supplies:
 Approximately 21⁄2 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric (For exact measurements
for your chairs, see the previous section.)
 Cloth measuring tape
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins
Making your slipcover
Follow these easy steps to create your slipcover:
1. Iron all your fabric well, so it’s flat and smooth when you’re ready to
drape and cut it.
2. Drape the fabric that will cover the back of the chair and the seat back.
Drape a length of fabric that you’ve cut to size so it’s facedown (wrong
side up) over the back of the chair, making sure to leave a flap of fabric
(about 1 or 2 inches long) hanging over on the chair seat, and about an
inch dragging on the floor in the back so you can create a hem later (see
Figure 16-9).
3. Pin your side seams using a 1-inch seam allowance, being careful not
to pin too tightly.
If you pin it too tightly, your fit will ultimately be too tight, which can
cause your slipcover to tear.
4. Grab your scissors and trim the excess fabric at the sides, carefully
cutting the fabric so as to create your 1-inch seam allowance (refer to
Figure 16-9).
5. Now it’s time to drape the fabric that will cover the seat and the front-
bottom part of the chair. Drape a piece of fabric cut to fit this area
facedown (wrong side up) and pin the sides of the chair.
As you drape, make sure to leave a 1- or 2-inch flap of fabric that sticks
up toward the seat back, and also make sure that the fabric in front
drags onto the floor about 1 inch (see Figure 16-10), so you can create
a hem later (in Step 13).
288
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

6. Pin the two front parts of the fabric as you did the sides, using a 
1-inch seam allowance (refer to Figure 16-10).
Again, be careful not to pin too tightly.

7. With both pieces of pinned fabric placed on the chair (fabric wrong
side out), pin the 1- or 2-inch flaps together where the seat back meets
the seat (shown in Figure 16-11).
8. Pin the back panel of the slipcover the same way you pinned the
front, following the back legs of the chair, joining the back panel to
the fabric over the back legs.
9. Carefully remove the pinned slipcover.
If you can’t remove it, first check to make sure that you didn’t pin it
directly to the chair cushion underneath. If you still can’t remove it,
your slipcover is too tight, and you need to move the pins in the back
to create more room. Do this a quarter inch at a time, making sure to be
consistent on each side, until the slipcover comes off easily.
10. When you’re satisfied that you can remove the slipcover easily, cut
the excess fabric off the front and back flaps of the bottom fabric (also
show in Figure 16-11).
11. Remove the slipcover and sew all the pinned seams, sewing along the
pin line and removing pins as you go.
12. Turn your slipcover right side out and replace it on the chair.
13. To create your hem, plan the hem so that the fabric falls exactly to the
floor.

Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

Pin your hem evenly with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance in mind, remove your
slipcover from the chair once again, and sew your hem using a zigzag
stitch on your sewing machine.
14. Turn your slipcover inside out and press the seams flat.
Replace it on your chair for the final time, and have a seat — you’ve
earned it! (Now you have five other chairs to do! Don’t rest too long.)
Fixing Up Those Ottomans, 
Stools, and More
Covering smaller furniture, such as ottomans and vanity stools, in fun slip-
covers is a great way to add some decorative flash without overwhelming
your decor. Though we don’t recommend using complicated prints for larger
furniture (because matching across fabric widths is difficult and expensive
because it uses a lot more fabric), ottomans and stools are a great place to
add a medium- or large-scale print. And because these small pieces of furni-
ture wear better, your fabric choices are broader.
This section offers cool projects to cover your favorite ottomans and vanity
stools. We even throw in an extra special project — one that covers your old
washing machine. (We hope this project might even add a bit of excitement
to laundry day.) 
Outstanding ottomans
Many people have an old ottoman sitting around in their den or living room
for its great function, but oftentimes that same (boring) ottoman wouldn’t
win a design award. No need to throw it away and buy a new one. Try this
easy ottoman project to “upgrade” an older ottoman; it’s a great opportunity
to add a bit of color, texture, or both, to your room’s decor.
Figuring fabric and trim
This project covers a square or rectangular ottoman. No matter if your
ottoman sits right on the floor or has little legs, this design covers the entire
ottoman, from the seat top down to the floor (you could easily shorten the
length measurement if you want to show off your ottoman’s gorgeous legs!)
We suggest heavy brocade for an ornate look. 
To create this ottoman slipcover, use a large square or rectangular piece of
fabric. To get the right measurement to cover your ottoman, place your mea-
suring tape on the floor at the bottom of the ottoman and measure the width
from floor to floor; that is, up and over the top of the ottoman from one side
291
Chapter 16: All in a Day’s Work! Intermediate Slipcover Projects

to the other. Repeat this measurement with the length. After that, add 1 inch
to each measurement and convert the inches of your larger measurement to
yards.
For example, our width measurement was 44 inches and our length measure-
ment was 50 inches. When we added an inch to each measurement for seam
allowance, we had 45 x 51 inches. Converting 51 inches to yards, we used 
11⁄2 yards of fabric, either 45 or 60 inches wide.
An ottoman begs for a bit of embellishment along the bottom, like a great
decorative fringe, so try it out! Bullion fringe is a great look, or try a fun ball
fringe for a playful, less-formal effect. To determine how much trim you need,
measure the ottoman’s circumference, measuring at the lower edge of the
ottoman, and add an extra inch or two. (Ours measured 108 inches, so after
converting to yards, we needed 3 yards of trim.)
Going for your supplies
To start your ottoman upgrade, gather these items:
 Approximately 2 yards of fabric (For exact measurements for your
ottoman, refer to the previous section.)
 Approximately 3 yards of decorative trim (You may need more or less
trim based on your ottoman’s size; refer to the previous section.)
 Iron and ironing board
 Measuring tape
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins
Creating your ottoman slipcover
When making your slipcover, follow these simple steps:
1. Iron all your fabric well, so it’s flat and smooth when you’re ready to
cut it.
2. Lay the fabric evenly over the ottoman, with the right side facing
down.
3. Using your straight pins, pin the sides together at each corner to
create four flaps of fabric (see Figure 16-12).
4. With your scissors, trim the four corners so that you have a 1-inch
seam allowance, also shown in Figure 16-12.
Be sure to measure the inch seam allowance, starting from the straight
line the straight pins form.
292
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

5. Remove the fabric from the ottoman, prepare your sewing machine
with heavy-duty thread, and sew your seams along the line formed by
the pins, removing them as you sew.
6. Turn the fabric right side out and test it on the ottoman to check the fit.
7. If you’re planning to use decorative trim, measure the bottom of the
slipcover all the way around its circumference to determine the
amount need.
8. Create a hem at the bottom of your slipcover by turning your fabric
under a 1⁄2-inch and stitching with your sewing machine.
If you prefer to add decorative trim (we recommend fringe), you don’t
need to hem the bottom. Just add it around the circumference of the
slipcover fabric, either by sewing, using iron-on bonding tape, or hot
glue from a glue gun. If you’re using a longer fringe, be sure to pin it in
place a bit higher so that it doesn’t puddle onto the floor.
Simple stool slipcovers
This project creates a lovely, soft, skirted-style slipcover for a round-seated
stool with a cushioned top. It looks great in a variety of rooms, depending on
the fabric you choose.
We designed this project to be made with lace; the bottom hem is merely
trimmed, not hemmed. If you don’t want to use lace, consider using eyelet, or
any fabric that drapes well but can stand up to the wear and tear of the body,
for example, a cotton or cotton-blend fabric that has a nice drape to it. Any
fabric with a bit of sturdy heft to it that also drapes well fits the bill (for more
on fabric choices, see Chapter 2).
Measuring for fabric and elastic needs
To create this handy slipcover, you need a square piece of fabric of the
appropriate size.

Chapter 16: All in a Day’s Work! Intermediate Slipcover Projects

1. To determine your width measurement, starting on the floor, measure
up and over the seat and back down to the floor on the other side.
Your length measurement will be identical; you’ll be working with a
piece of fabric that is a giant square.
2. Add an inch to each measurement for your 1⁄2-inch seam allowance
and then convert the inches to yards.
Our stool, for example, had a width and length of 47 inches.
Adding the inch for the seam allowance, we needed a piece of fabric that
was 48 x 48 inches. Because 45-inch-wide fabric doesn’t cover 48 inches,
we needed 60-inch-wide fabric or 11⁄2 yards.
Elastics come in different widths and have different strengths. Even elastics
of similar widths often have different strengths, so take the elastic out of the
package and make sure it feels strong enough to hold the fabric in place. For
this project, you need 1⁄4-inch-wide elastic, which offers a medium strength,
one that will hold up to the human body. The elastic needs to go around the
entire stool to hold the slipcover in place.
To determine how much elastic you need, measure your stool seat’s circum-
ference, and add a few inches to be on the safe side. In our project, we used
about a yard.
Gathering your gear
Before you begin, grab these supplies:
 Approximately 11⁄2 yards of 60-inch-wide fabric (For an exact measure-
ment that fits your stool, see the previous section.)
 Approximately 1 yard of 1⁄4-inch-wide elastic (See the previous section
to get an exact measurement of the amount of elastic you need for your
stool.)
 Chalk
 Iron and ironing board
 Measuring tape
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins
Creating your stool slipcover
To whip up your stool slipcover, follow these steps:
1. Iron all your fabric well, so it’s flat and smooth when you’re ready to
drape and cut it.
294
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

2. Carefully drape your fabric facedown over your stool and secure it
with pins stuck straight down into a few different parts of the seat’s
cushion (see Figure 16-13).
3. With your tailor’s chalk, draw a line on the fabric all the way around
the bottom of the stool cushion (where the cushion meets the wood or
metal base; again, see Figure 16-13).
4. If you are using lace, simply trim your hem evenly around the bottom
fabric, where the stool’s legs meet the floor, using the lace’s pattern as
a guide.
If you prefer, allow an extra inch of fabric at the bottom to create a
sewn hem.
5. Remove the fabric from the stool.
It should look like a large circle.
6. Stretch your elastic around the seat cushion, so it looks like a large
rubber band, to see how long it needs to be.
Your goal is to obtain a length that easily and comfortably slips on and
off your stool, yet also secures your slipcover.
7. When you’ve determined the correct length of the elastic, cut it and
stitch one end to the other, so it looks like a large rubber band.
8. Pin the elastic evenly around the chalked circle on the fabric, attach-
ing it with a pin in four equal places (see Figure 16-14).
9. Stitch the elastic band onto the circle you drew on the fabric with
chalk, using a zigzag stitch.

10. Slide your slipcover over your vanity stool. 
11. If you want to create a bottom hem, pin a 1⁄2-inch hem evenly along the
bottom of the slipcover, remove it, and sew your hem.
You’re done!
Covering your washing machine
Why would anyone make a slipcover for a washing machine, you may ask. We
can think of several reasons including:
 You want to give a beloved old appliance a new look. You may have an
old appliance that still runs well, but that may not look the greatest.
 You want to tidy up a small room for the day or evening.
 You want to add a bit of useful space (for guests’ coats and hats, for
extra dishes or plates, and so on).
Do you live in a small apartment or house? This project is great for
people with limited space and who utilize their laundry room with sev-
eral different functions: Does your laundry room have a “slash”
attached: laundry room/kitchen, laundry room/play room, laundry
room/bathroom, laundry room/garage? If so, a washing machine slip-
cover can create new usable space.
This slipcover completely covers your washing machine, except for the
back where the pipes and wires are. Velcro flaps cover the dial area, making
access easy so you don’t have to remove the slipcover to use the machine.
This project is ideal for a top-loading washing machine. If you have a newer
front-loading machine, you probably want to show off its sleek exterior rather
than cover it up.

When selecting a fabric, you can choose one that matches your wall color to
make your washing machine disappear, or you can go for something wildly
contrasting to create a piece of “furniture” and amuse your company. We rec-
ommend a heavy-duty cotton twill or even denim.
We cut our pattern with butcher paper (inexpensive paper ideal for making
paper patterns), which you can buy at any crafts store. We recommend using
an L-square to keep your corners straight. For more on these items, see
Chapter 5. This project also uses squares of self-adhesive Velcro to keep every-
thing in place. You can use any width you want, but we recommend 1- or 2-
inch-wide Velcro (for a few words on the wonders of Velcro, see Chapter 13).
Measuring your machine to determine your fabric needs
To obtain your measurements, follow these steps:
1. For your width, measure the washing machine from the floor on one
side to the floor on the other side.
2. For your length, measure from the top of the machine down to where
you load the clothes in, across to the front, and down to the floor.
Don’t forget to add your 1⁄2-inch seam allowance to each measurement, too.
Our machine measured 27 x 43 inches, with a depth of 26 inches. We
measured all our washing machine areas’dimensions, added up all the
inches, and determined that we’d need 6 yards of 45-inch-wide fabric for
a washing machine of this size. You can use our illustrations and direc-
tions for this project to help figure out what you’ll need.
Getting it all together
In order to make this slipcover, you need the following supplies:
 Approximately 6 yards of 45-inch-wide fabric (For exact measurements
for your machine, refer to the previous section.)
 Approximately 1⁄2 yard of 1- or 2-inch-wide self-adhesive Velcro
 Butcher paper
 Chalk
 Iron and ironing board
 L square (to keep your corners square when making the pattern)
 Measuring tape
 Notepad and pencil
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins

Measuring and cutting the different pieces
You have to measure three sides of your washing machine (the back remains
uncovered), plus the top, where the clothes load and the area with the knobs.
1. Grab your measuring tape and measure the front first, as shown in
Figure 16-15.
Ours measured 30 x 45 inches, to which we added 1 inch to allow for the
1⁄2-inch seam, so our measurement was 31 x 46 inches. (If you’re creating a
pattern, record your measurement in your notepad, calling it “FRONT.”)
2. Measure one side of your washing machine from front to back and
add 1 inch, as shown in Figure 16-16.
You need two of these measurements for each side. (If you’re creating a
pattern, record it twice for both sides, calling them “SIDES”).
3. Measure the top, as shown in Figure 16-17.
For the top of the machine, your length measurements needs to start at
the back, come down over the area with the knobs, over the top-loading
door, and overlap onto the front of the machine 7 inches. For the width,
measure from one side to the other, adding an inch to each dimension.
Our length was 42 inches, and our width was 31. (If you’re making a pat-
tern, record it in your notepad, calling it “TOP.”)

5. Iron your fabric and then cut your pieces in fabric.
When cutting your sidepieces, you want mirror images, so if you’re using
a pattern, make sure to flip your side pattern on the fabric.
Putting it all together
Follow these simple steps when assembling and you can’t go wrong:
1. Prepare your sewing machine with heavy-duty thread.
2. With right sides together, stitch the front side seam to the side panel
front seam, using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance (see Figure 16-18).
Repeat on the other side.
3. Place the top piece on the washing machine and mark the top edge
(where the horizontal-edge top section ends and meets the vertical-
edge of the area with the dials) with chalk.
4. Stitch the piece of fabric for the top of the machine onto the larger
piece you’ve created in a way that creates a free-moving flap.
Stitch only to the end of the top part marked with chalk, as in Figure 16-19.
5. Remove your fabric from the washing machine and bring it over to
your sewing machine.
6. Hem all your raw edges, using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance (see
Figure 16-20).

7. Attach Velcro directly to your washing machine to keep the slipcover
in place.
Remove the Velcro’s self-adhesive backing and add a half square of Velcro
to the sides of your machine toward the back and in the matching areas
of your slipcover. You also want to attach Velcro to the front of your
machine where the knobs are to keep the flap in place. See Figure 16-21.
Use one or two 1-inch squares of Velcro for the front flap, and several 
2-inch squares for the sides.
7. Attach your washing machine slipcover to the Velcro and you’re done!
Now the real work begins. Start with a load of whites.

elcome to advanced slipcovering! In this chapter you discover some
sophisticated techniques that pack tons of style into a few easy steps.
You can add these extras to the intermediate slipcovers we discuss in
Chapter 16. In this chapter we explain each project step by step, but if you
want a bit more information about a specific sewing skill, check out Sewing
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Jan Saunders Maresh (Wiley).
In this chapter, we discuss how to add piping to a slipcover, how to create
a reversible slipcover, how to add zippers to slipcovers, how to work with
pleats, how to create a slipcover for a table, and how to make a useful stor-
age ottoman.
Always use heavy-duty sewing machine needles and heavy-duty thread for
these projects. You need a heavy-duty needle to sew smoothly and evenly
through medium- or heavyweight fabric, and heavy-duty thread ensures that
your creation lasts through the wear and tear of everyday use.

Making Slipcover Cushions with Zippers
Adding a zipper to a slipcover cushion is a nice way to give a finished look
and lets you remove your cushion covering easily (which is especially impor-
tant if you have little ones because the cushion covering is the part that
always seems to get dirty first).
Zippers can also be added to the back side seams of sofas to allow for a
better fit if your sofa is wider on top than the bottom, or if it has an unusual
shape. As an introduction to using zippers, try this project to build your con-
fidence with using slipcover zippers.
We recommend creating paper patterns for this project, because it includes
quite a few pieces; labeling your pieces can help you keep everything in order.
To create a slipcovered cushion with a zipper, you have to buy the right size
zipper in a coordinating color. Most sewing stores sell zippers by the foot
or yard.
Gathering your supplies
Before you start, grab these supplies:
 Enough fabric to cover your cushion. Our cushion measured 24 x 24
inches, and we used about 2 yards of fabric, which allowed us plenty to
work with.
 A 50-inch zipper
Our standard-size, 87-inch-wide sofa had cushions that measured 24
inches wide x 24 inches long by 6 inches high, so we needed a 50-inch
zipper. We bought 41⁄2 feet and trimmed it to 50 inches (see Chapter 5 for
information on how to do this properly).
 Cloth measuring tape
 Iron and ironing board
 Notepad and pencil (you’ll be recording quite a few measurements with
this project)
 Scissors
 Seam ripper (to remove the stitches above the zipper teeth)
 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins
304
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

Creating your zippered cushion
The following steps can help you correctly insert your zipper:
1. Measure your cushion’s top and bottom, and record the measurement
in your notebook, labeling it “Top/Bottom, Cut 2.”
Our top and bottom were both 24 x 24 inches, plus 1 inch to each mea-
surement for the seam allowance for a total of 25 x 25 inches.
2. Measure your cushion’s side, and record the measurement, labeling it
“Sidepieces, Cut 2.”
Our sides were 6 inches high, so our measurements before adding seam
allowance would be 6 x 24 inches. After we added the seam allowance, it
measured 7 x 25 inches.
3. Measure the area where your zipper will be attached. Remember that
you’ll be adding another inch to this zipper sidepiece measurement (for
the seam allowance); note it in your notebook as “Zipper Sidepieces ,
Cut 4.”
Our side measurement came to 8 x 25 inches. When it’s time to cut this
piece of fabric in half lengthwise, you’ll be left with two pieces that are
25 inches wide by 4 inches high. You will discard one piece and label the
remaining one “Zipper Sidepieces, Cut 4.”
4. If you’re making paper patterns, create and label them, and use them
to cut your pieces, or simply cut your fabric using the measurements
you recorded in your notebook and our instructions.
Again, we really recommend making paper patterns, because doing so
helps you get the fabric pieces just right, but it’s up to you.
5. With the right sides together, arrange the “Zipper sidepieces” together
in pairs, and sew each pair together along one end, creating two long
pieces.
Our four pieces each started out as 4 x 25 inches and wound up as two
pieces both 4 x 50 inches.
6. Press all seams open with your iron at the heat setting appropriate for
your fabric.
7. Using a basting or long-stitch setting on your sewing machine (you
remove this stitch later; see Step 11) and a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance on
each strip, place the two long “Zipper sidepieces” strips next to each
other and sew them together.
After this step, we created a piece that was 7 x 50 inches.
8. Press all the seams open with your iron at the heat setting appropriate
for your fabric.
Now it’s time to sew the zipper.
305
Chapter 17: Slipcover All-Stars: Advanced Projects

9. With straight pins, pin your zipper facedown with the teeth right on
the seam (see Figure 17-1a).
Your zipper needs to be wrong side up, sewn onto the wrong side where
the seam allowance shows.
10. Stitch along the center of the zipper tape on each side and tack
each end.
Tacking is a short, securing stitch that is permanent; you tack by going
back and forth a few times with your sewing machine.
By going over the ends of the zipper, you’ll better secure the part that
gets the most wear and tear. (refer to Figure 17-1b.)
Be careful when tacking over the ends of your zipper, because the metal
can break your sewing machine needle. Go slowly back and forth so that
the needle slips in between the teeth.
11. Turn the fabric over and, starting above the zipper pull, remove all
the baste or long stitching from the long seam that’s over the zipper
with your seam ripper.
In this step, you’re exposing the zipper and the zipper pull (see
Figure 17-2).

12. Unzip the zipper about 8 inches.
Doing so gives you an opening to pull the fabric through when you’re 
finished.
13. Stitch together the two sidepiece strips from Step 2 to create one long
strip.
Ours measured 49 x 7 inches. This is the piece of fabric that makes up
the cushion’s side.
14. Sew the two cushion sidepieces together along each end, forming a
square as shown in Figure 17-3.
15. With the right sides together, pin and stitch on your top and bottom
pieces, using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
Work slowly: Follow the seams and bend the strip when you get to the
corner to navigate around it. Follow the seam allowance, making sure not
to make any pleats or gathers as you sew. (If you’ve accidentally sewn in
an unwanted pleat or gather, take your seam ripper and use it to remove
the seam, baste around the corner to keep it flat, and then resew it.)
16. Turn your slipcover right side out through the 8-inch unzipped part
and insert your cushion.
Adding Piping to a Slipcover Cushion
This project offers a trimming technique that you can add to the cushion slip-
cover from earlier in this chapter. You could also add it to the bottom edges
of your slipcover. Piping is a decorative edging inserted in a seam between
two sections of slipcover fabric. Piping adds a bit of pizzazz, and you can
show off your sewing skills and add a professional look to a slipcover’s cush-
ions. This edging technique is also a great way to add a contrasting color or
to pull in another color in your room’s color scheme. Your sewing machine
has a special sewing foot, called a zipper foot (for more on this attachment
see Chapter 5), to use for adding piping.
Figure 17-3:
Sewing your
sidepieces
into a
“square.”
307
Chapter 17: Slipcover All-Stars: Advanced Projects

You can buy premade piping, or you can make it yourself (although we don’t
recommend it). Adding piping is easy after you get the hang of it, but it does
take a bit of practice. You can always try out your piping technique on a
smaller piece of fabric before you start a whole slipcover. Piping is available
at fabric stores and is pretty inexpensive; it can run from $1.50 a yard toward
the $5-per-yard range.
We recommend that you use the cushion slipcover explained in the previous
section. Before you actually insert the piping, of course, you’ll have to have
your cushion fabric cut and ready to be sewn. No need to finish the raw
edges on the areas to be piped, the piping will do that for you. We use a
sewing technique here called basting (a hand stitch or large stitch on your
sewing machine that holds fabric in place before you do the actual sewing).
Along with pinning well, these are the keys to getting the perfect piped look.
Machine basting is much faster than hand basting, and the stitches will
be applied more evenly, but it’s up to you — use whatever method you’re
most comfortable with. To determine whether your sewing machine can do
a baste stitch (almost all do), read the owner’s manual. If it turns out that
yours doesn’t have a baste stitch, just use the longest stitch your machine
makes, which is a fine substitute.
Gathering your gear
Before you start, you need the following items:
 Your cushion fabric (refer to “Making Slipcover Cushions with Zippers”
earlier in this chapter), cut and pressed but not yet sewn
 Cloth measuring tape
 A few yards of cord-filled piping for each sofa cushion
To figure out how much piping you need per cushion, just measure the
length of each seam in which you intend to insert the piping and add a
few inches for turning corners. For one 24 x 24-inch cushion from our
average-size, 87-inch-wide sofa, we needed 5 to 6 yards of piping.
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins

Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

Adding your cushion piping
Follow these simple steps to have beautiful piping in no time:
1. Iron all your fabric well so your piping and cushion fabric attach
smoothly.
2. Working on the right side of the fabric, chalk your 1⁄2-inch seam
allowance line all the way around the edge of the fabric where you’ll
be applying the piping (see Figure 17-4).
Start on the back of the cushion, so you end your piping in an area out of
sight (your cushion looks more streamlined).
3. Line up your piping on the right side of the fabric so that the piping’s
seam allowance is aligned on the cushion fabric’s seam allowance (see
Figure 17-5).
The piping’s raw edges need to be oriented toward the raw edge of the
cushion fabric. The tube part of the piping needs to be just over the 
1⁄2-inch chalked line.
4. Pin or machine baste the piping and fabric together to keep them in
place. If you prefer to hand baste the fabric together, you can do that
instead.
5. Place the corresponding layer of fabric over the top of the pinned or
basted layer.

6. Using your zipper foot, sew at the 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, getting as
close to the piping as you can.
Doing so traps the piping in between the two layers of fabric, and when
you turn the cushion cover right side out, all you see is the piping. The
piping’s seam allowance is caught in the cushion’s seam allowance (see
Figure 17-6).
7. To finish the piping, simply overlap the two ends where they meet
and stitch them into place, or you can snip out a bit of the cord and
bend it toward the edge of the fabric and stitch it.

Add piping around the bottom part of the cushion as well, to match the top
section. That way you can flip your cushions (great for hiding stains!).
Concocting Reversible Slipcovers
and Cushions
This reversible slipcover saves time and space because you don’t have to
wash, fold, press, and store two separate covers. Being able to reverse and
change it at the drop of a hat is also wonderful. Are you tired of that bright
floral motif you looked at all summer? Switch it over to the calming, neutral-
toned side to give your room a brand-new vibe.
Making the reversible slipcover
To create a reversible slipcover for a sofa, loveseat, or armchair, follow the
instructions for creating a sofa slipcover in Chapter 16. You may also want
to consider making a rub-off pattern if your sofa has an unusual shape, (see
Chapter 13, where we discuss making a rub-off pattern). You need to buy
twice the fabric, of course, and when it comes time to cut your fabric, you
need to cut out two slipcovers, one in each fabric. (See Chapter 2 for sugges-
tions on picking fabrics for reversible projects.)
The Chapter 16 slipcover covers the cushions. This project offers you the
choice of creating reversible cushions. If you want to skip covering the cush-
ions separately, you can leave them on the sofa or armchair while you’re
measuring, so the reversible slipcover goes right over the cushion. (If you
decide to cover the cushions separately, take a look at Chapter 10, to read
all about adding a bit more fabric to accommodate tuck-ins — those little
creased areas of your sofa — that change the way you measure your sofa.)
Grabbing your gear
Gather this gear to get started:
 Two unhemmed basic slipcovers (refer to Chapter 16 for all measuring
and assembly instructions)
 Iron and ironing board
 Measuring tape
 Scissors
311
Chapter 17: Slipcover All-Stars: Advanced Projects

 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread. Thread your
bobbin with a color to match the side you’re sewing, or choose a neutral-
toned thread that will match both colors.
 Straight pins
Making easy reversible slipcovers
When creating your reversible slipcovers, follow these simple steps:
1. Turn your slipcovers inside out.
2. Pin your slipcovers together and sew them together along the bottom
edge with a 10-inch opening along the lower front area left for turning
them right side out. The two slipcovers should “mirror” each other
(see Figure 17-7).
Figure 17-7:

Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

3. Turn the slipcovers right side out and hand stitch the opening closed.
4. Push one slipcover inside the other, making sure to match all the cor-
ners and seams.
Push your hands into the corners (or use a small tool, like a ruler or
chopstick) and along the seams so they’re smooth and consistent.
5. Press your slipcover with an iron, or steam it after it’s on your furni-
ture with a steamer.
Making a reversible cushion slipcover
If you like the look of cushions that are individually covered, try this project.
To make a reversible seat cushion, you’ll be sewing something that looks like
a fabric box. To create your pieces, measure your cushion’s width, and then
measure your cushion’s circumference (the measurement all the way around,
starting from one point on the edge; see Figure 17-8). Be sure to add 1 inch to
both measurements for your seam allowance. Your “top” piece will look like a
long rectangle; the two smaller “side” pieces will be smaller rectangles.
Determining your fabric needs
To determine how much fabric you need, follow these easy steps:
1. Measure all the way around the entire cushion, recording width,
length, and depth.
2. Add them together.
3. Double that number (so you can reverse the cushion).
Our square cushion was 30 inches square, which we doubled for
60 inches, and 4 inches deep, which we doubled for 8 inches. We needed
68 inches, or 2 yards (72 inches) per reversible side, for a total of 4 yards
per cushion.

Getting your supplies
Gather this gear to get started:
 A few yards of fabric for each cushion (See the previous section to figure
out how much fabric you need.)
 Cloth measuring tape
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins
Making easy reversible cushions
To create your reversible cushions, follow these steps:
1. Iron all your fabric well.
2. Cut your fabric to create one long piece and two sidepieces, based on
your cushion’s measurements.
3. Fold the fabric so that the short ends of the “top” piece — the long
rectangular piece — meet; use a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance to sew this
long rectangular piece into a tube with the right sides together (see
Figure 17-9).
4. Starting at the corner, pin one of the smaller rectangular sidepieces
into the mouth of the tube, right sides together, using a 1⁄2-inch seam
allowance (see Figure 17-10).
5. Stitch only one long seam on the other side to create a flap (see
Figure 17-11).
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 using your other style fabric.
7. With the right sides together, stitch the openings (the “mouth” and
“flap”) together, leaving a 6-inch hole (see Figure 17-12).

Hide the safety pins on the underside of your chair.
Making a Pleated Skirt 
for a Sofa or Loveseat
For not much more time and money, and with not much more fabric, you can
add a pleated skirt to a basic sofa slipcover and add some charm. (You can
also add a pleated skirt to any preexisting slipcover you already own to jazz
it up a bit.) The pleated sofa skirt in this section is a classic box pleat that fits
many different decors and keeps its shape well. Three front pleats and one
pleat for each side give a great look and are easier to make than many tiny
pleats. We created this skirt from many pieces of fabric; that way you can run
smaller amounts of fabric through your sewing machine (and save money on
fabric, too). The piecing seams are hidden in the pleats, making your work a
bit easier.
Figuring out your fabric needs
To figure out how much fabric you need for the front, back, and sides of the
sofa skirt, follow these easy steps:
1. Determine your sofa skirt’s width measurements by measuring the
front of your sofa.
Insert cushion
and pin closed
Figure 17-13:
Inserting
and pinning
the cushion.
316
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

To this measurement, add 36 inches (for three pleats made from 12 inches
of fabric each). Divide that sum by 2 and then add 1 inch for the seam
allowance.
Our sofa front width was 87 inches. So, adding 36 inches to that mea-
surement was 123 total inches. Dividing 123 by 2 gave us 611⁄2, and
adding 1 to that (for the seam allowance), we ended up with 621⁄2 inches.
2. Determine the height of your sofa skirt by first deciding where you
want to attach it, measuring from there to the floor, and adding 1 inch.
Our sofa skirt needed to be 12 inches high, so our fabric needed to be
13 inches long to allow for the seam allowance.
The width and height numbers you end up with determine the size of
each panel. You need four total pieces of fabric (two for the front and
two for the back) that are each this size.
So, for the front and back of our sofa, we cut four pieces of fabric that
measured 621⁄2 x 13 inches.
3. Measure the side of your sofa from front to back to determine the
depth, and add 12 inches to that measurement for your pleat and
1 inch for the seam allowance.
Our sofa’s depth was 37 inches. Adding 12 inches to that measurement
for the pleat plus 1 inch for the seam allowance brought us to 50 inches.
Because the height will still be 13 inches, we needed two pieces of fabric
at 50 x 13 inches.
To figure your fabric amount, pick a fabric width and do some simple math to
determine how many pleat pieces you can fit into the width. For a 60-inch-
wide fabric, you should be able to cut two 13- x 62-inch pieces, plus two 13- x
50-inch pieces from 3 yards of fabric. Since 13 times 4 is only 52, you’ll have a
few inches to spare for your width. You may want to add an extra yard just to
be on the safe side lengthwise.
Gathering your supplies
Before you start, you need to gather these goods:
 A few yards of 45-inch or 60-inch-wide fabric
See the previous section for instructions on figuring out exactly how
much.
If you’re creating a sofa skirt to add to an existing slipcover, instead of
trying to exactly match the fabric, pick a fabric that provides a nice con-
trast. If your slipcover is a solid, add a skirt made out of small-print
fabric. (We don’t recommend working with larger prints for this project;
the repeats are too hard to match, and you’ll waste a ton of fabric!)
Adding a skirt made from a small-print fabric is a great way to pick up
317
Chapter 17: Slipcover All-Stars: Advanced Projects

another fabric or motif elsewhere in the room. Add a pillow or two in the
skirt fabric to pull the whole look together.
 Cloth measuring tape
 Dressmaker’s chalk (optional)
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins
Determining pleat placement points
To determine the pleat placement points on the front of your sofa, divide the
width measurement of the front of your sofa by 4. Our sofa front width was 87
inches; divided by 4, we get 213⁄4 inches. On the right side of our sofa front, we
measured in 213⁄4 inches from the corner, and added a straight pin and did the
same thing on the left side. Then we added a straight pin to the exact center
of the sofa front (at 431⁄2 inches from the corners). These are our 3 pleat place-
ment points.
To determine the pleat placement points for the sides of your sofa, divide the
side depth measurement in half; that will be your pleat placement point for
each side. Our side measurement was 37 inches, so our pleat placement point
on each side of the sofa was at 181⁄2 inches, centered between the corners.
Making your pleated skirt
Follow these steps when creating your pleated skirt:
1. Stitch two of your longer pieces together at one end to make one long
piece.
Ours started out as 621⁄2 x 13-inch pieces and ended up as one 124 x 
13-inch piece.
2. Create the back skirt piece the same way.
3. Fold in your front pleats, which require 12 inches of fabric per pleat:
6 inches for the larger “rear” fold of each pleat and 3 inches for the
two smaller “front” folds of each pleat.
Use Figure 17-14 as a guide. Pin into place and press with a hot iron.
4. Fold your side pleats according to Step 3.
Check out Figure 17-15. Pin into place and press with a hot iron.

5. Stitch your sofa skirt together using a straight stitch, keeping the pins
in place.
Stitch the four sections of the skirt together, and then sew across the
top of the pleats so that they stay in place and are ready for attaching.
See Figure 17-16.
6. Measure up 12 inches from the bottom of your sofa slipcover (or how-
ever high you want the top of your pleated skirt to be) and pin your
sofa skirt to your slipcover upside down, right sides together, as
shown in Figure 17-17.
Make sure you pin the skirt to the slipcover as the figure shows. You
want to be able to flip the skirt down over the bottom of your slipcover.
If you prefer to work with the slipcover off the sofa, measure evenly all
around the slipcover and mark your measurement with dressmaker’s
chalk, and then pin the skirt on. Use a ruler or seam gauge to make sure
it’s even.

your skirt all the way around, using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance on your
sofa skirt.
8. Hem the pleated skirt, using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, and press with

Stitched Vanity Stool 
Slipcover with Ruffle
This project is an adorable vanity stool slipcover for a bathroom, changing
room, little girl’s room, or cabana. The ruffles are worth the extra time and
effort. Try a fabric that keeps its shape, such as the nonshiny version of
chintz called cretonne, lace, silk shantung, or any kind of heavier cotton.
Avoid any fabric that is too slippery, such as satin or charmeuse, because
even people with buns of steel might slide right off!
Measuring and determining fabric needs
To figure out your seat pattern measurements, start underneath your seat
cushion, where it meets the wood or metal underside, and go across the
diameter to the same point on the opposite side. Add 1 inch for your 1⁄2-inch
seam allowance.
Our stool cushion diameter was 20 inches total, so our pattern would be a
circle that has a 21-inch diameter.
To get the skirt measurement, follow these two steps:
1. Measure your stool from the floor to the bottom edge of the stool’s
cushion.
Our stool height was 16 inches, plus 1 inch for the seam allowance, for a
total of 17 inches.
Figure 17-17:
Pinning the

2. Measure the skirt circumference and double it.
Our skirt circumference was 33 inches, so we doubled that to 66 inches,
plus 1 inch for seam allowance for a total of 67 inches.
Our skirt pattern would measure 17 x 67.
We added all our fabric measurements together to come up with our total
fabric needs. We needed less than a full yard of 45- or 60-inch-wide fabric for
our seat and about another 11⁄2 yards for the skirt for a total of approximately
21⁄2 yards of 45- or 60-inch-wide fabric. We also needed 1 yard of 1⁄4-inch-wide
elastic. To determine how much elastic you need, simply measure the circum-
ference of your seat and add a few inches.
What you need to make this project
Gather these supplies together to get started:
 A few yards of fairly stiff, nonslippery fabric (Refer to the previous sec-
tion to figure out exactly how much you need.)
 1⁄4-inch-inch medium-strength elastic (Again, refer to the previous section
to figure out exactly how much you need.)
 Butcher paper or pattern paper
 Cloth measuring tape
 Iron and ironing board
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins
Making your stool slipcover
Follow these easy steps to dress up your vanity stool in no time:
1. Create your cushion and skirt patterns, if you want to make a pattern,
and cut all your fabric. For your cushion, draw a large circle on your
butcher paper that is the exact diameter of your stool seat, then draw
a 1-inch circle around that, to allow a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
Your skirt pattern will be a large triangle.
2. Place your skirt fabric right sides together so that the fabric is facing
inside out (be sure to join the two smaller sides; for our stool, they
were the sides that measured 17 inches). Sew your skirt fabric into a
tube, using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
321
Chapter 17: Slipcover All-Stars: Advanced Projects

3. Working on the stool, you’ll be gathering the fabric to the stool’s cir-
cumference (see Figure 17-18). With fabrics face-to-face and raw edges
aligned, pin your gathered skirt to the fabric circle using a 1⁄2-inch
seam allowance.
4. Take the fabric off the stool and stitch the two pieces together using a
1⁄2-inch seam allowance (see Figure 17-19).
You can use the long stitch of your sewing machine or the gathering foot.
5. Stretch your elastic around the seat cushion like a large rubber band
and see how long it needs to be to comfortably slip on and off your
stool.
Holding the two ends together to get an approximate length and then
pinning the elastic ends with a safety pin will help.
6. Cut your elastic to the appropriate size and with chalk or a marker,
mark your elastic evenly in quarters and pin the elastic to the corre-
sponding quarters of the fabric circle.

7. Sew the elastic around your circle on the seam you created when you
sewed the skirt to the cushion fabric, pinning and stretching the elas-
tic to accommodate the length as you sew.
To finish the elastic ends, overlap the elastic 1⁄2 inch and use a zigzag
stitch to sew it together so that it looks like a large rubber band.
8. Hem your ruffle at the bottom using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
Turn inside out and slip it on your stool!
Creating Slipcovers for Tables
What could be more sophisticated than a well-dressed table? You can use this
softening slipcover for a side table, a dining room table, a front hall table, or
anywhere you want to add a bit of style with fabric. We hope you agree this
slipcover is a step up from even the most elaborate tablecloth because of
how it dramatically wraps and envelops your furniture, offering another
opportunity to add color to your decor.
On the practical side, a slipcovered table is a useful place to tuck away boxes,
shoes, cleaning supplies, or anything you want handy but out of sight. It also
serves to transform an otherwise sturdy but beat-up table you can’t bring
yourself to throw out.
Rectangular table slipcover 
with inverted pleats
Try this pretty table slipcover in a heavy brocade, denim, or even a cotton
canvas. It features inverted pleats that add a touch of elegance; each pleat is
centered along each of the table’s lengths. You can add a simple ribbon trim
to the bottom edges to match the ribbon you use for the bow detail, but
avoid fringe because it’s designed to extend to the floor. This project can be
used for any size table.
Getting the right amount of fabric for your table
To determine how much fabric you need, add your table’s height to the table-
top’s circumference, add 12 inches per pleat, and divide by 36.
Our table, for example, was 30 inches high, 30 inches long, and 24 inches wide.
Adding the width of 30 inches to the length measurement, we got 54 inches. To
that we added 12 inches per pleat for a total of 156 inches. Because we used a
table that’s 30 inches high, 45-inch wide fabric would work perfectly. To find
the total yardage needed we divided 156 inches by 36 inches and came up with
approximately 41⁄2 yards of 45-inch-wide fabric.
323
Chapter 17: Slipcover All-Stars: Advanced Projects

Your ribbon measurements should be in proportion to the size of the table
you’re treating. We used 2 feet for each side, for a total of 4 feet.
Gathering your gear
Before you begin, grab this gear:
 A few yards of 45-inch-wide fabric (Refer to the previous section to figure
exactly how much you need.)
When using printed fabrics with this slipcover, avoid one-way prints,
because the fabric on the sides of this slipcover can’t all run in the same
direction as the top. A petite print works fine, however.
 A few yards of matching 1-inch ribbon (Refer to the previous section to
figure out exactly how much you need for your table.)
 Butcher paper or pattern paper (optional)
 Cloth measuring tape
 Iron and ironing board
 L-square (optional)
 Notepad and pencil
 Scissors
 Sewing machine with appropriate color heavy-duty thread
 Straight pins
Covering up any table
Follow these steps when making your table cover:
1. Iron all your fabric well so that it has no wrinkles or creases.
2. Measure your tabletop and add 1 inch to each measurement (for the
seam allowance) and record it in your notebook as “Tabletop Pattern,
Cut 1.”
Our top measurement was 14 x 36 inches, so our pattern measured 
15 by 37.
3. Measure the height and width of the front of the table, adding 12 inches
to the width for the pleat allowance, plus 1 inch for the seam allowance
to both measurements, and record the measurement in your notebook
as “Front/Back Pattern, Cut 2.”
Our front measurements were 36 x 30 inches. To our width, we added
12 inches for our pleat allowance, plus 1 inch for the seam allowance,
for a total of 49 inches. For the height, we added 1 inch for the seam
allowance, for a total of 31 inches.
324
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

4. Measure the height and depth of the side of the table, adding 12 inches
to the width for the pleat allowance, plus 1 inch for the seam allowance
to both measurements, and record it in your notebook as “Side Pattern,
Cut 2.”
Our side measurements were 14 x 30 inches. To our width, we added
12 inches for our pleat allowance, plus 1 inch for the seam allowance,
for a total of 27 inches. For the height, we added 1 inch for the seam
allowance, for a total of 31 inches.
5. If you’re creating paper patterns, transfer the measurements to paper,
cut the paper out, label each pattern piece, and use them to cut your
fabric. (For tips on making paper patterns, see Chapter 10.)
If you’re just measuring your fabric, use an L-square to keep your edges
straight, and cut your fabric.
We recommend that you use paper labels, but if you really don’t want to
mess with it, you don’t have to.
6. Fold, press, and pin your two “Front/Back” pieces to create pleats,
using Figure 17-20 as a guide.
Fold and pin your fabric in 12-inch increments, so that your pleat mea-
sures 6 inches (formed by the 3 inches of “tucked” fabric on either side).
7. Fold, press, and pin your two “Side” pieces to create pleats, using
Figure 17-21 as a guide.
Fold and pin your fabric in 12-inch increments, so that your pleat mea-
sures 6 inches (formed by the 3 inches of “tucked” fabric on either side).
8. With the right sides together, using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance, sew your
panels in between the front and back panels, as in Figure 17-22.

Sew up to the top, leaving a 1⁄2-inch area unsewn so that you can sew
around the corners when you add the top.
9. Pin the right side of your top panel to your skirt so that all the corners
line up with the skirt seams (see Figure 17-23).
10. Sew the slipcover top to the rest of your slipcover, matching corner to
corner, and with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
When sewing the unsewn 1⁄2-inch areas (see Step 8) to the slipcover top,
be sure to back tack a few times so your seams will hold.
11. Hem any unstitched edges with a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance (or sew on
decorative ribbon or other trim to the bottom edge, if you choose to
do so).

12. Press your slipcover and put in on the table.
13. Add your bows by locating the top of a pleat and measuring down
from the top 7 inches.
Pin two pieces of ribbon of equal length to the inside edge of the pleat.
You can either remove the slipcover from the table and stitch the rib-
bons to the pleat and tie them into a bow, or you can work right on the
table and hand stitch them on, whichever is easiest for you.
Making a multiuse table/ottoman/storage
trunk
This project creates a useful and tasteful ottoman made of two inexpensive
trunks that’s perfect for an apartment where extra storage is at a premium,
or for anywhere that you want to add a bit of extra seating. It triples as an
ottoman, coffee table, and storage area. We like cotton velvets, heavy bro-
cades, and even denim for this project.

Dollars and cents: A sample budget
To make an elegant slipcover for a table, you
don’t have to go into hock. We estimate that it
only costs about $27 to $35 to make this beauti-
ful slipcover. The cost increases or decreases,
depending on how elaborate you want your
fabric to be. Here’s how we figured it:
 5 yards of printed cotton, such as a toile: $20
 4 yards of matching ribbon: $2
 Heavy-duty thread: $2
 A roll of butcher paper or pattern paper: $3

Figuring your fabric needs
To determine your measurements and how much fabric you need, follow
these simple steps:
1. Measure the width and length of the two trunks when they’re pushed
together side by side.
Ours were 32 x 32 inches, plus 1 inch added to each measurement for
seam allowance, for 33 x 33.
2. Measure the height of the two trunks, and add 3 inches to allow for
the 2-inch-thick foam padding, plus 1 inch for the seam allowance.
Our trunks were 12 inches high, so with the foam, our height measure-
ment was 15 inches, plus 1 inch, for a total of 16 inches.
3. Make a simple drawing, labeling the height, width, and length of the
sides, write down each dimension, and then see how many pieces you
can fit into a length of 45- or 60-inch-wide fabric.
Our table was small enough to use a 45-inch-wide fabric since our maxi-
mum width was only 33 inches. Here’s how ours came out:
1 piece 33 wide x 33 long (top of ottoman)
4 pieces 33 wide x 16 inches long (four sides, which will become
two, of ottoman)
4. Add the measurements of these pieces together and divide by 36.
By adding 33 and 64 (16 times 4), we got 97 inches, so we can use a piece
of fabric 97 inches long by 45 inches wide, or about 3 yards of 45-inch-
wide fabric.
Gathering your gear
To start this project, you need the following stuff:
 A few yards of 60-inch-wide fabric
Refer to the previous section to figure out how much.
If you’re using a napped fabric, such as velvet, or any other raised-tex-
tured fabric whose look can change if the fabric is brushed one way or
the other, make sure that the nap runs the same way along all the sides
of the ottoman for a uniform appearance. For printed fabrics, avoid one-
way prints because the fabric on the ottoman’s sides can’t all run in the
same direction as the top.
 Two inexpensive trunks
328
Part IV: Challenging Projects to Try 

We recommend a discount department store as a place to purchase inex-
pensive but sturdy trunks if you don’t already own some.
 2-inch-thick, high-density foam cut to size (to match the top of your
trunk tops pushed together)
 1 yard of self-adhesive Velcro
 Butcher paper or pattern-making paper (recommended for this project)
 Cloth measuring tape
 Iron and ironing board
 Pen and notebook
 Sewing machine or needle and thread
 Straight pins
Making the trunk ottoman
If you’re ready to make your trunk ottoman, follow these steps:
1. Iron all your fabric well so that it has no wrinkles or creases.
2. Push your trunks together so they’re as close as they can be, with the
fronts with the latches touching each other face to face.
3. Place corresponding pieces of self-adhesive Velcro on the top of the
trunks and on the foam, so the foam doesn’t slide, and then place the
foam on the trunk.
4. Measure the height and width of the sides and front and back to
create your patterns. Record your measurements and create the pat-
tern for the five sides of the ottoman, with the foam in place on top of
the two trunks making sure to add an inch to each measurement for
the 1⁄2-inch seam allowance.
Label each piece appropriately.
5. If you’re not making patterns, just cut your fabric for the top by measur-
ing the width and length and adding 1 inch to each measurement for
seam allowance. Ours was 32 x 32 inches, and became 33 x 33 inches.
6. Cut and sew together your four “long” sidepieces of fabric using a 
1⁄2-inch seam allowance. Ours each measured 33 x 16. You’ll be creat-
ing a large box with the sides.
7. Matching the corners to the side seams, pin your top to the stitched-
together sides, then stitch around the seam to create the slipcover; see
Figure 17-24.
329
Chapter 17: Slipcover All-Stars: Advanced Projects

8. Hem the bottom of your slipcover using a 1⁄2-inch seam allowance by
folding a 1⁄2-inch of fabric under and zigzag or straight stitching around
the edge.
9. Place your slipcover on the trunks and you’re done!

Ten Interior Design Tips to Follow
In This Chapter
 Keeping your color choices simple
 Mixing solids and prints
 Mulling over a few other design factors
I
nterior designers get to be experts by studying art history, decorating his-
tory, color theory, architecture, and aesthetics, and then successfully
applying their knowledge to the contemporary world. In other words, they
know what’s been proven effective and desirable throughout different eras
and can incorporate that knowledge into real rooms.
This chapter includes a few tried-and-true tips from designers that are sure
to please you and your room. (You can also check out Home Decorating For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Katharine Kaye McMillan and Patricia Hart McMillan
[Wiley] for more info about home decorating.)
Let Color Be Your Guide
Pick a color scheme and follow it at all costs so that your room maintains a
uniform, finished look. That doesn’t mean that your room has to be only one
color. In fact, it can be one, two, or three colors; just make sure you work only
with those colors throughout the room.
Say, for example, that the three colors of your sun porch or den are light tan,
light gray, and pale yellow, and your furniture is a light-colored wood. If your
walls are yellow, your carpet is gray, and you have some lamps shades that
are tan, along with some light terracotta pottery, picture frames, and a tan-
colored floor tile, a natural color scheme for your window treatment may be
a stripe that contains a tan-and-gray motif on a white background or another
type of printed fabric that contains two or even three of the colors in your
palette.

Another color tip: Choose a printed fabric for your window treatment or slip-
cover (or both) that contains a bit of the color of your walls. Coordinating
colors in that way pulls in the predominant color of the room and reflects it
elsewhere, which is another way of giving a room a uniform, cohesive appear-
ance. For more tips on using color, see Chapter 1.
Complement Solid Colors
Mixing solids and solids isn’t too hard to do. Pick a color palette that you like
and stay with it. If you love the cool tones of apple green, find another color
on the cool side of the spectrum, say a lemon yellow, and put the two fabrics
side by side. You’ll see how two muted tones complement each other, just as
two warm tones do.
A neutral with a bright color always provides a nice contrast: pure white with
a strong pink, or try black with aqua, for example. Some other color combina-
tions that we like are green and beige, white and gold, yellow and gray, cobalt
blue and silver, coral and brown, aqua and brown, and of course black and
white.
Match Colors in Solids and Prints
When mixing solids and prints, be sure they share colors in common. Doing
so gives a uniform feel to the room. Things that clash and don’t relate to one
another stick out like a sore thumb and look misplaced.
Use very little of one when the other is dominant. For example, if your
window treatment is made from print fabric, you can use a solid color (that’s
within the print) for the tieback, or vice versa. This allows extra detail and a
way to bring in this fabric in other ways in the room, for example, a throw
pillow or lampshade.
Adding a solid ruffle to a printed panel is another way to mix solids and
prints, or try the opposite: Add a printed ruffle to a solid panel. When using
a printed ruffle with a printed fabric, you can lose the detail of the ruffle all
together because the fabrics blend together. If you’re going through the trou-
ble of making a ruffle, why not show it off!
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Contrast Print Sizes and 
Match Print Colors
Mixing prints well isn’t as hard as you may think. The key to mixing prints
with panache is considering their respective scales, that is, the sizes of the
repetitive motifs that make up the print — the flower, peacock, star, or little
pink elephant. Don’t try to match scales, but rather, contrast them: a large
flower print with a small gingham print, for example.
Prints that refer to each other in color — a stripe and a brocade in the same
color — are an unbeatable match. Similarly, looking for matching base (or
background) colors of printed fabrics is a good way to narrow down your print
fabric search. Hold the fabric up to a natural light source to make sure the base
color is really what you want — white and not off-white, for example — and
then look at swatches of the two fabrics side by side.
Some classic print mixing that we enjoy include gingham and florals, florals
and florals, bamboo print and tropical floral print, and stripes and polka dots.
Check out the coordinating fabric lines offered by many fabric manufacturers
for ideas, even when you don’t intend to buy them outright. The manufactur-
ers do the mixing and matching for you, so you can adjust your eye to the
busyness of two prints.
Avoid Certain Prints
We aren’t, by any stretch of the imagination, fabric snobs, but we must admit
we’re not big fans of certain prints. Unless they’re for a little girl’s room, large
polka dots are tough to incorporate into a room; small polka dots are much
easier. Polka dot prints are randomly designed, and when sewing them,
they’re notoriously hard to match along seams as perfect circles. Stick to
smaller, all-over polka dots to make your projects much easier.
Some intricate paisley prints (especially the ones that contain many dark
colors, like forest green, navy, brown, and burgundy) turn to mud when
viewed from a distance. When you’re deciding on a busy print, it pays to
stand back and view it from afar. To avoid this problem, look for bright pais-
leys. Choose instead a paisley with sharp, bright, contrasting colors to avoid
muddiness. Try using something with pink, orange, and red on a white back-
ground, or a simple blue-and-white paisley, which although it’s simple, packs
a big design punch.

Chapter 18: Ten Interior Design Tips to Follow

Cheat with Sheets
In Chapter 2, we discuss how sheets are a great way to cheat when making
window treatments. Don’t be afraid to use an extra set of good-quality sheets
as the fabric for a window treatment. Matching the window sheets to the
sheet and duvet set you have on your bed is a quick and relatively inexpen-
sive way to pull a bedroom look together. Use the same rules for mixing
prints and solids in bed sheets as you would any other fabric.
Be a Copycat
No, we don’t mean buying back issues of Architectural Digest and exactly
replicating the designs you find inside. Instead, you may want to consider
making color copies of your fabric from a window treatment or slipcover to
incorporate into your room elsewhere. It’s just much easier working with a
high-quality copy of your fabric than it is to cut and mount fabric, especially
under glass (trust us, we’ve done it!).
Search the scrapbooking or craft sections of any crafts or fabric stores (see a
list of them in Chapter 20), and be sure to buy high-quality, acid-free paper
that absorbs the colors beautifully and won’t fade over time. Look for the
largest size paper you can find, load it into the color copy machine, and
you’re good to go.
You can create a matte or background for a picture frame, or a series of pic-
ture frames grouped together. You can recover a lampshade. You can place
the printed paper under a clear piece of acrylic or Lucite to serve as a desk
blotter to protect any writing surfaces, or under the glass of a side or coffee
table. Remember: Just because something is easy to do doesn’t mean it can’t
look great — or be professional looking!
Use a Bit of Black
Black is great for touches here and there, but not so great as an all-over color
in home decor. A little bit of black really punches up your decor. Try it for
picture frames, accent pillows, trim, or fringe on both window treatments and
slipcovers, for lampshades, and for window treatment hardware. A black rod
and finial set looks beautiful as a contrast to a bright-colored window treat-
ment fabric. Add some black to color that can take it, such as bold, primary
colors like true reds and greens, bright colors like robin’s egg blue, or its nat-
ural complement, white.
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Although an all-black slipcover for a sofa or loveseat at first seems like a
good idea — it’s the little black dress of home design, hides dirt, and goes
with every color — please trust us, after a few weeks (save for the hardiest
devotees of minimalism), an all-black sofa grows a bit depressing. You’ll avoid
sitting on it and hate staring at it from another part of the room. Before you
know it, you’re tossing a colorful blanket or throw over your new creation to
hide it, defeating the whole point of making a new slipcover.
Don’t Fuss Over Pennies
We’ve said it elsewhere in this book, but this one bares repeating: Always buy
an extra yard or two of fabric to repair holes in the window treatments or
slipcovers you make, to add a new ruffle or replace a hem (two areas of a
window treatment most likely to get damaged), or to create a pillow cover
from your window treatment fabric (another great way to pull a look
together). For those of you with kids and/or pets, furniture armrest covers
may need a refresher before you know it. If you wait until you really need it,
your beloved fabric may be out of stock and gone forever.
Store these extra fabrics flat — with a minimum of folding — in a dry con-
tainer away from exposure to sun to prevent creases and fading.
Alternatively, you can hang delicate fabric prone to creasing on a hanger in
the closet of your sewing room (if you’re lucky enough to have one).
Keep Your Pattern Handy 
(And Out of Sight)
Unless you’re a very organized type who keeps files in his or her sewing
room, here’s an easy storage idea that we love and use: Keep the patterns for
your slipcovers in a manila envelope taped to the underside of the furniture
upon which the slipcover resides. When you need to make a new one, you’ll
always know where to find it. It also helps when you move and you need to
locate the pattern.

Chapter 19
Ten Interior Design Rules to Break
In This Chapter
 Mixing it up to break the rules
 Shaking up the proportional status quo
 Faking it just for the look
 Mixing prints with prints
C
hapter 18 tells you the design rules to stick by; this chapter gives you
the lowdown on the rules you can chuck by the wayside. Sound fun?
Trust us, it is.
When coauthor Mark Montano designs rooms on his TV show While You Were
Out, he is forced to bend and sometimes break design rules so he can work
with what’s at hand. We believe that do-it-yourselfers were born to bend a
few rules, and sometimes, breaking the rules is just what the design doctor
ordered.
Start from the Ground Up
Start from the ground and go up is a standard bearer of the design world. It
means you start with your floor or carpet, move to the furniture, then the
walls, window treatments, lighting fixtures, and then fill in with design acces-
sories. Although that may be fine for people who hire decorators to redo
entire rooms, what about the common everyday Jack or Jill who can’t afford
to toss out their rugs, fixtures, and furniture? How do they do it? We say start
anywhere you like, and we offer some tips for doing so in this section.
An easy and proactive way to evaluate where change needs to start is to take
out your color notebook and list all the elements in the room, their qualities,
and whether they absolutely must stay or may be able to go. (See Chapter 2
for more on starting a color notebook.) Here are some examples:

 Rug: Dark green wool — brand new: It must stay!
 Sofa: Bright red with yellow stripes — I hate it! Needs to be recovered.
 Chair: Navy denim — stay or go, either way.
 Table: Medium-toned wood — old, not of real value, could go.
 Ottoman: Pastel blue fabric — doesn’t really go, but my cat loves it.
 Window: Dark blue miniblinds — could use an update.
 Walls: White — boring, but easy.
Because the rug and chair are the “stays” and the other elements in the room
are “go’s,” base your changes around those two areas. Here’s one way to
make a change: Starting with your furniture, consider recovering the ottoman
and sofa, which can make the room feel fresher and even make the table look
better. Pick a solid fabric to cover the sofa that complements the dark tones
of your stay items: the green rug and navy chair, perhaps a dark red would
work well for your slipcover. Next up is your window treatment. You can
choose a printed fabric that pulls in some of the other colors in the room,
perhaps a plaid that features dark green, navy, and tan. To cover your
ottoman, consider the same fabric you used for your window treatment, or
refer to the color you chose for your sofa.
Next, choose a brand-new color for the walls that works with dark red, navy,
and forest green, such as cream or tan. You may also consider making a slip-
cover for your table if you find the medium-toned wood looks too light with
your deeper palette.
Keep the Colors Muted
Most designers use muted tones for walls and echo that color in window
treatments to add subtlety and refinement. This concept is supposed to allow
the furniture to do most of the talking in a room’s design. But what if your fur-
niture isn’t that spectacular, and you’re more interested in adding a pow
rather than a discreet whimper?
Why not try this instead: Pick the boldest and brightest color from your
window treatments or slipcovers for your wall color. If you have a stripe or
floral print that contains red, pink, white, and cream, rather than relying on
the last two, choose an exact match of the red or pink, or a color that’s close
to either one. This unexpected color treatment makes your room sing,
instead of snore.
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Mind Your Proportions
The tried-and-true maxim of using small prints in a small room is a bit dated.
Sometimes a bold print in a tiny room can make it look bigger by attracting
the eye across the room. We especially love Marimekko fabric. The signature
print style of this Finnish design house is its large but simple, almost child-
like, flowers and bold abstract prints in wonderful bright colors, which are
perfect for smaller rooms. Marimekko is great for creating bold window treat-
ments and nice for adding a pillow or two.
For a small room with only one window, consider adding a bold window treat-
ment mounted around a basic mirror that’s placed directly across from the
real window. This new faux window reflects light around a small room and
creates the illusion of space.
Less Is More
Most people are living in an age of minimalism, which, simply put, says,
“boring.” A way to get a unique look in place of the cookie-cutter decor
offered you in the myriad home catalogs and design magazines is to embell-
ish your creations.
Try adding faux flowers, leaves, buttons, or ribbon bows to window treat-
ments or slipcovers. Consider whipstitching (see Chapter 12) on felt shapes
in a variety of colors — favorite animals, letters of the alphabet, simple flow-
ers, trucks, trains, and cars — to slipcovers in children’s rooms rather than
buying the commonplace pink or blue slipcovers offered in catalogs and
retail stores.
Never Mix Styles and Periods
Some people feel pressure to create authenticity in their home designs by
picking a style or period and sticking with it, no matter what. But an all-
Western home decor, or an all-Victorian home decor, does get really tired
(and overdone) after a while. Everything looks the same!
Mixing design periods based on how furniture looks is much more fun than
limiting your selection to time periods. Mix the streamlined and geometrical
look of art deco–style fabric with classic Asian-inspired furniture, which fea-
tures traditional Oriental motifs. The contrast between modern and ancient is
341
Chapter 19: Ten Interior Design Rules to Break

very striking. Or add a slipcover made from an ornate rococo-style fabric to a
modern room . . . doing so also provides interesting contrasts between the
“new” and the “old”. Don’t be afraid to add an old-fashioned touch to even
the most modern and minimalist of designs. For example, chandeliers add
glamour to any room.
If You Want Your Treatment to Look
Good, You Have to Sew It
You’re not in home economics class anymore, and that means you don’t actu-
ally have to sew. Yes, beautiful craftsmanship has its place. Antiques stores
and furniture showrooms are full of handcrafted pieces that you can admire
or even buy. But face it, not everyone wants to sew in order to change their
decor. Fortunately, you have a few options.
Remember that instead of sewing embellishments into place, you can always
simply drape a length of ribbon or fringe over window treatments the way
you would streamers at a birthday party. That way you can take them down
and change them at a whim (an especially good treatment for stationary
window treatments that rely on tiebacks for opening and closing).
If you’re slipcovering a piece of furniture that’s on its last legs or that you just
bought at a bargain basement price, consider using your glue gun for adher-
ing fabric directly to the old fabric on the piece of furniture. Nobody will
know but you, so what have you got to lose?
Draperies Have to Be of Certain Lengths
In Chapter 6, we provide you with traditionally defined lengths for draperies
and curtains (used by people who sell and specialize in window treatments),
but actually there’s a wide range of lengths that are perfectly fine. Whether
5 inches below the windowsill or 5 inches above the floor, your draperies can
end wherever you want; don’t get bullied into cutting fabric that you want to
keep — or buying fabric that you don’t really need.
342
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Draperies Are for Windows Only
Fabric traditionally is used to cover something, but what about hanging
fabric for the sake of, well, just hanging it? Using fabric as a wall treatment is
a wonderful way to add some drama to your decor. You can hang a unique or
handmade fabric panel behind a sofa the way you would a painting. Mount
tiny casement-style rods to the wall and attach the fabric that way so that it
becomes the room’s centerpiece and a great design detail on which to elabo-
rate elsewhere in the room.
Think about using a set of draperies hung from a mounted rod in place of a
headboard for your bed. When the draperies are closed, you get a space-
enhancing block of color or a gorgeous print to enliven your room; when the
draperies are open, you can reveal a mirror or a special piece of art hidden
behind them.
Only Use Home Decor Fabrics 
for Your Creations
You have many choices for using fabrics in unconventional ways. Mixing
unusual styles and colors and using fabrics that aren’t normally considered
for window treatments and slipcovers are two such uses that we describe in
this section.
Think curtain couture: Consider using fabrics you’d use to make a dress,
blouse, or even a coat to make slipcovers or window treatments. Dress fab-
rics, such as wool crepe or wool challis, go a long way toward warming up a
living room, or try a fabulous balloon valance (see Chapter 14) made from
sequin fabric for a kid’s room with a circus theme. Faux furs make the most
cushy and fun slipcovers, and add wit and style to any room.
Layering fabric upon fabric is a fun way to create a bold and unusual look for
windows in rooms where it’s least expected. Two different colors of sheer
fabrics sewn together at the bottom of the rod sleeve create a new color. For
example, yellow and blue make green, and blue and red make purple. A lay-
ered treatment is nice for windows that receive a frequent breeze: When the
wind moves the window treatment fabric, the colors change.
343
Chapter 19: Ten Interior Design Rules to Break

And don’t forget about mixing prints with other prints. White lace kitchen
curtains backed with hot-pink gingham as a lining is a nice example of an
unexpected treatment. Animal prints can go everywhere! Dalmatian and
zebra prints look great when they’re mixed with bold black-and-white floral
prints. Stripes and leopard are naturals together.
Different = Tacky
Some people shy away from adding anything kooky to their decor for fear of
creating a look that’s tacky or, well, lacking in refined design. Maybe they
grew up in a house like the one in the movie The Christmas Story, where their
dad’s major award (a lamp made from the fishnet hose–covered leg of a man-
nequin) burned brightly — like “electric sex” — in the front window. If so,
they may not want to return to living with major awards in bad taste.
But a little bad taste can go a long way. To paraphrase Diana Vreeland, one-
time Vogue editor and one of the savviest style matrons of the 20th century:
“A little bad taste is okay; it’s no taste that worries us.”
You don’t want your room to be so tasteful that nothing makes it stand out.
Too much good taste can be a form of failure; it doesn’t allow your guests an
opportunity to start up a conversation or your children to have fun and relax
in your home.
One item per room that is whimsically adorned, found, refurbished, or a little
out of the ordinary is all you really need. Add two if you’re really confident,
or create a collection of objects that defy any negative criticism. Live by our
decorating maxim!

Ten (or So) Web Resources for
Fabric, Hardware, and Notions
In This Chapter
 Finding the great sewing chain stores
 Buying fabric online
 Shopping for window hardware in catalogs and on Web sites
 Considering notions and odds and ends
A
lthough sewing store chains stock virtually everything you need for
sewing projects (Velcro, shears, needles, no-sew bonding tape, thread,
fabrics, and trims) and best of all, they have stores in many locations across
the United States (and Canada), you can also buy directly through their Web
sites without setting a foot outside. The Internet is fast and convenient, and
the sites we recommend are reliable. Many of these sites have specific sec-
tions titled “drapery fabrics,” “home decorator fabrics,” or “upholstery fab-
rics” so your search is narrowed down a bit. Make sure that you have a good
idea of how the fabric you’re buying is made, for example, its fiber content,
and how it can be cleaned, because you can’t consult the fabric’s bolt tag
online.
This chapter includes our ten (actually 12, yes it’s your lucky day!) favorite
resources ranging from fabric stores to notions retailers.
Always double-check return policies regardless of where you shop; this infor-
mation usually is contained in “help” or “customer service” sections of the
Web sites. Most Web sites provide a toll-free number that you can use to com-
municate with customer care representatives. Speak directly to a customer
care representative whenever you have a question. As with all online endeav-
ors, let the buyer beware. We recommend that you use the numbers to get
answers to your questions about guarantees, returns, and other buying poli-
cies, because each company’s policy is different, or may have changed after
the publication of this book.

ance department that has some great bargains.
