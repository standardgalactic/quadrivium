Where It All Began
On a muggy night in May, I sat stranded in an Asian airport. It was the end of
a long, overscheduled business trip—one of the many I took each year in the
search for new banking clients. In the midst of a large pile of waiting room
debris, I noticed a book. Dog eared and well used, it caught my attention. I
picked it up, and my view of the world was altered forever.
“If a man does not keep pace with others, perhaps it is because he hears
a different drummer,” it began, with the oft-quoted Henry David Thoreau.
The book, an obscure and since-discontinued interpretation of Swiss psy-
chologist Carl Jung’s theories, outlined the seemingly obvious differences in
the way people take in information and make decisions. Some of this I knew
intuitively. Yet the information hinted at a new way to deal with my clients
and associates.
On returning to my Hong Kong office, I set out to color code each of my
customers based on their Jungian behavioral profiles. Each client file con-
tained brief instructions for support staff to follow in the event of my absence.
“When a Gold comes in, make sure all statements are up to date and
organized in date-sequential order. If a Blue makes an appointment, call our
investment guys in New York and get three new ideas.” And so it continued,
outlining a strategy for each of four color groups. 
It proved uncannily effective. Almost overnight, our new business increased
by 60 percent. But there was more. I began to enjoy my clients more, my stress
level went down, and, in time, my relationships with others outside of work
began to improve.
For some ten years, I continued to use this technique. The bank sent me back
to the United States, and the clients grew more diverse: white-robed sheiks in
Abu Dhabi, shipping magnates in Athens, aristocratic landowners in Spain. But
INTRODUCTION

the same color-coding instructions dotted their files. What’s more, they
worked: for men, for women, old and young, widely varying ethnicities, the
results were universal.
In that decade, I never met another individual who spoke of Jung, at least
not in terms of applying his concepts to marketing. Then, in 1995, I joined
some friends in Maine to escape from burnout and institutional reorganiza-
tion. I needed to rethink my career. 
The small Port Clyde Inn sparkled in the crisp October sunlight, and on
the front porch sat a man reading a book. We began to chat and he spoke of
the author Isabel Myers and her new applications for the work of Jung, a sys-
tem called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.® It was the conversation I had
been looking for.
Over the next few years, I discovered a hidden universe of books, seminars,
and associations involving hundreds of people around the world. I had a new,
strong sense of internal direction. Suddenly, things just began to happen; the
right people and events began to materialize. Jung would have called it syn-
chronicity.
It was a couple of years before I could undertake my own research, but
eventually my life became focused on the business applications for personality
styles. The material that follows sums up the information provided by the
over 60,000 people who have attended Color Q seminars around the world
and the personality-type experts who have laid the intellectual groundwork
that serves as the basis of this book.
Evaluating people was key to survival during my unusual childhood. I
was born a countess in Hungary. When my family fled the communists, we
landed in the court of King Farouk of Egypt, where I played with his daugh-
ters in his 550-room palace. Seven years later, we fled the horrifying blood-
shed of Gamal Abdel Nasser’s revolution and were fortunate to find a new
home in the United States.
I’ve turned what I learned through these many stages of my life into a sys-
tem that helps all of us define our unique strengths, pursue the best career,
and reduce conflicts in key areas of our lives.
For the sake of simplicity, I have adopted my own color-coding system
of earlier times, which I call Color Q (“When you meet a Gold, make sure
that . . .”). It served me well for many years, and it will serve you well, too.

The Purpose of This Book
Many of us share the fantasy that we can do anything and be anyone with just
a little more effort. This is an illusion that blocks real development. Growth
does not require significant change or that we emulate role models because
we are somehow innately inadequate. It does require that we understand and
accept the dynamics of our own genuine style—its unique strengths and
weaknesses. It also means that in time, we tone down some of our blind spots. 
There are many systems for understanding people. This is the one I have
found that probes most deeply into the core of human behavior. It confirms
that each personality style is natural, equal, observable, and predictable, and
that each can be equally effective at work. 
Truly exceptional people always do so much more than is required. The
only way to do that without severe burnout is from passion born of confi-
dence. You are the right person doing the right thing in the right place and
enjoying it. Sound impossible? Not at all, for those who are true to themselves
in spite of naysayers, parental expectations, and societal pressures. Use this
book to reveal your road to being exceptional. 
What Color Q Is Not
Color Q is not the answer to all career problems. It is not a painless shortcut
to maturity and wisdom. Most of all, it does not measure the impact of edu-
cation, intelligence, mental health, special talents, economic status, motiva-
tion, drive, or environmental influences on the core personality type. There
are billions of unique people on our planet and only four Color groups. If you
wonder what that leaves, I say only the deepest, most important part of you—
the part that always knows what it really wants and won’t be happy until it
gets respect.
The framework is not gender specific. It works equally well for males and
females. Men and women are found in each personality style, though in some
groups the percentages differ.
Finally, Color Q is not a complete, in-depth Myers-Briggs evaluation. It is
a ten-minute self assessment designed to acquaint you with concepts that are
applicable to your career and personal life.
What Color Q Is
Color Q is about coding people—ourselves and others. We do it all the time.
“He is shrewd and entrepreneurial.” “She is energetic and artistic.” This helps
I N T R O D U C T I O N

I N T R O D U C T I O N
us to group our impressions mentally and store them in the appropriate
synapse of our brain for future use. 
Color Q is also a tool for understanding the sometimes incomprehensible
behaviors of bosses and coworkers (and even friends, dates, and mates). Since
so much career advancement depends on your people skills, you’ll find your
increased ability to read people perhaps the most valuable outcome of reading
this book. 
Enjoy this journey.

Defining Yourself and Others
PART 1

THIS IS NOT YOUR typical career book. The Color Q system doesn’t
change people, but it does change how they view themselves. You will not be
told to be more organized, to assert yourself, imitate your boss, or emulate
some celebrity CEO. You will not even have to change how you dress. Instead,
every word will move you to operate from your deepest, most natural talents,
fueling the passion that separates good workers from great achievers. You just
need to recognize your strengths and use them on a daily basis. 
Sound easy? It’s not. Most of us come loaded down with guilt and
parental/societal expectations that push us in unnatural directions. Did pres-
sures like money, prestige, educational opportunity, or family desires force you
into making more “practical” choices? If doing so hasn’t made you happy, then
what will?
You need to get back to your core and make it work in the workplace.
Define this core by taking the Color Q self assessment in chapter 2 and being
bluntly honest. For many of you it will be career altering, if you answer as you
really are. Please note that a preference is not “I generally work with piles, but
I’d prefer if I kept my desk clean.” What you actually do is what you prefer. 
You do not need to read the whole book, unless you want to explore all six-
teen Color Q personality types. Learning a little about other people’s styles,
however, will help you in:

Instructions: Part I
IN THE COLOR Q personality profiling system, you have a primary person-
ality Color. This is who you are at your core. You also have a backup Color—
a strong secondary influence. Finally, you have an Introvert or Extrovert
tendency. Color Q describes people, for example, as Green/Red Introverts.
This ten-minute either/or self assessment will reveal all three aspects of your
personality.
Select one of the two choices in each line according to your first impulse,
which is usually correct; but choose as you are, not as you would like to be.
Don’t overanalyze your choice. There are no right or wrong answers. Think
of this like your left or right hand. While you can use both, you have a pref-
erence for one over the other, and you use that hand with less effort and bet-
ter results. If you are truly torn between the two choices, it may mean you
either feel guilty about your honest answer or feel pressured to function in a
certain way.
First, fill out Section I, choosing what you (not your boss, mate, parents,
or anyone else) prefer. Choose from column A or column B. Each A or B
choice must be filled in by choosing the statement that describes you at least
51 percent of the time. You should wind up with nine checkmarks total in
this section.

Instructions: Part II
Now read the short overview of your primary Color below. Does it ring true?
If yes, continue to part III to determine your backup style. If not, skip down
to part V, “What to Do If This Doesn’t Ring True for You.”
Golds (46% of population)
Grounded, realistic, and accountable, Golds are the backbone of institutions of
all kinds—corporate and public. They are society’s protectors and administra-
tors who value procedures, respect the chain of command, and have finely
tuned systems for everything. From raising children to running large divisions,
Golds get involved in details and are known for following through and mobilizing
others to achieve concrete goals. They are most interested in making lists, plan-
ning in advance, and dealing with what has worked in the past.
Blues (10% of the population)
Theoretical, competitive, and always driven to acquire more knowledge and
competence, Blues are unequaled when it comes to dealing with complex,
theoretical issues and designing new systems. As natural skeptics, their first
reaction is to criticize and set their benchmarks against which they measure
everyone and everything. They are highly precise in thought and language,
trusting only logic, not the rules or procedures of the past. Blues are future-
oriented visionaries who do best in positions requiring strategic thinking.
Then they move on with little interest in maintenance.
Reds (27% of the population)
Action-oriented, spontaneous, and focused on “now,” Reds need freedom to
follow their impulses, which they trust over the judgment of others. Cool headed
and ever courageous, they get things done and handle a crisis better than most.
Found in careers that provide freedom, action, variety, and the unexpected, they
bring excitement and a sense of expediency. Work must be fun and the environ-
ment collegial for them. Reds resist schedules and hierarchies. Long-term plan-
ning is a low priority for them, as each day brings its own agenda.

PA R T  1  |  T H E  J U M P  S TA R T

Greens (17% of the population)
Creative, empathetic, and humanistic, Greens need an environment that is
idea oriented and egalitarian and that provides the chance to impact the lives
of others. Gifted in their understanding of people’s motivations, they have an
unusual ability to influence and draw the best out of others. They also excel
in verbal and written communications and in the ability to position ideas.
Greens are enthusiastic spokespersons for the organizations of their choice,
and have a unique, charismatic quality that sweeps others into their causes.
Instructions: Part III
Now that you have determined your primary style, go back to the assessment
and fill out the section you originally left out (Section II or III). This will pro-
vide you with your backup style. You should share about 40 to 50 percent of
the characteristics of your backup style. The backup style refines your
primary style. 
If your primary is Gold or Red, your backup is either Blue or Green.

More About the Extrovert and Introvert
Since the Extrovert/Introvert dimension is often misunderstood, it is worth
explaining further. First of all, it appears to be biologically based and has
nothing to do with liking people or being socially adept. 
Extroverts (which Jung and the Myers-Briggs community spells
“extraverts”) get their energy from being with people and doing group activ-
ities. If they have to spend too much time alone or doing tasks that require
solitude, they quickly become tired, bored, and dispirited. Introverts get ener-
gized from their inner resources, that is, spending time alone to recharge their
internal batteries. Even if they like being with people, which most Introverts
do, interacting too much can drain their energy.
The population divides fairly equally between Extroverts and Introverts,
and many hide their natural preference well. An Introvert who needs to social-
ize for business can appear Extroverted to casual acquaintances. We all use
both dimensions, but not at the same time. Also, as your score will indicate,
you may be mild or pronounced in this dimension. Relationships between the
two are often tense until this dimension is understood and valued.
Next Step
If your overview sounds right, read about your primary Color first: Greens in
chapter 4, Reds in chapter 9, Blues in chapter 14, and Golds in chapter 19.
Then read your individual chapter, which is one of the four immediately fol-
lowing your primary Color.
If you want to delve deeper, read about your backup Color. For skeptical
Blues, reading chapter 3, “A Quick History of Personality Typing,” might be
your first stop so you don’t feel you’re wasting your time on an unproven
methodology. Greens may want to skip straight to their individual chapter,
and then into chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other
Styles,” to learn about other Colors. Golds will prefer to follow the recom-
mendations above, and reading one chapter a day will allow you to absorb
and review this material. Reds, we know the self assessment wasn’t all that
much fun, but your individual chapter will be. Go there now and skim it;
you’ll see it can be quite entertaining.
What to Do If This Doesn’t Ring True for You: Part V
Your personality Color is simply who you really are when not pressured by
family, friends, or work life. But if the majority of characteristics do not ring
true, it is likely that you belong to another group.

Go back to the self assessment and check the section where you had close
scores. Did you answer the way others need you to be? Or as you feel you
ought (instead of prefer) to be? That creates false results. Choose the opposite
column choice and follow instructions to a new Color. If that fits better, go
up to Section III and continue. 
Or, see if a family member or friend who knows you well agrees with your
self assessment. You might be very surprised, as one lawyer was when her
friend of thirty years corrected her answers to most of her self assessment.
The lawyer didn’t want to admit to her real preferences for piles on her desk
and last-minute deadline rushes. Remember, we’re not judging you here, or
even suggesting that you need to change. And what you categorize as a weak-
ness actually might be a strength—for example, the tendency to focus prima-
rily on short rather than long term goals. 
People are multifaceted. Though everyone has a predominant type, people
may be one of several shades of that style. A person may be a strong Gold with
a Blue backup. Another might be a light Gold and hence not as pronounced
a Gold. Also, as you get older, you develop the nonpreferred parts of your per-
sonality and may appear less Gold than in younger years.
If you are going through catastrophic life changes or have been dissatisfied
with your life for some time, scores can reflect your survival skills and not
your real preferences. You may have “forgotten” your real preferences,
although unhappiness is a signal that they’re being denied. Try answering as
if, right now, you lived in the world of your choice. If your personality Color
still seems wrong, wait until things have stabilized and retest yourself.

A Quick History 
of Personality Typing
CATEGORIZING PERSONALITIES into types—an activity called typol-
ogy—has been embraced by major civilizations since ancient times. For more
than twenty centuries, scientists and scholars have recognized that while indi-
vidual people are unique, there are predictable patterns of human behavior.
Around 400 BC, the Greeks, most notably Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen,
believed human behaviors fell into four groups, or “humors”: sanguine,
melancholic, phlegmatic, and choleric.1
In the 1920s, the pioneering Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, who had
been a favorite student of Sigmund Freud’s, split away and developed his own
typology.2 According to Jung, human beings’ four ways of intersecting with
reality were thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition, which he outlined in
his book Psychological Types, published in 1921. He called these the four
“functions.”
Jung spent most of his life studying how people are similar and different.
He concluded that certain inborn or early emerging preferences become the
steadfast core of our likes and dislikes about other humans and the physical
world. He further described each of these functions as being used in either the
outer or inner world and hence in different ways, concluding that each person
has one of eight mental processes as the most preferred or dominant.
Jung’s theories were abstract. Fortunately, in the 1940s, a mother and
daughter team began to provide a practical key to unlocking his work. These
CHAPTER 3

two U.S. women, Isabel Myers and her mother, Katharine Briggs, individually
and together spent the next forty years testing Jung’s ideas by observing the
people around them. They quantified their observations, then rigorously
tested and validated them. They created the most extensively tested person-
ality typing system ever developed, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®
(MBTI®) inventory,3 which to date has been administered to millions of peo-
ple around the world.
In the 1950s, another typology enthusiast, David Keirsey, did work that
overlaid the Greek humors onto the Jungian/Myers-Briggs types. In his book
Please Understand Me, he outlined four temperament groups, which serve as
the basis of the Color Q model in this book. Since then, his work has been
expanded by his longtime student Linda Berens, who continues to provide a
rich array of new insights.
Today, work on the MBTI is continued by the next generation, Peter and
Katharine Myers, co-owners of the MBTI copyrights.
“The Jungian model is an excellent nonthreatening tool for developing
career goals,” said Katharine Myers in a recent interview. “Extensive research
shows that certain types more than others are drawn to each career. However,
since every type is found in every field, no one should be told not to go into
any specific career. If an individual is strongly drawn to a profession, he or
she needs to be clear on the tasks inherent in the job and then evaluate what
their skills will contribute.” It is not uncommon for people to create special
niches in areas dominated by other types.
Myers is a Green, as defined in chapter 4. And like many in her group, she
excels at fostering the growth of others. 
Meanwhile, modern brain imaging technology has validated many of the
MBTI’s theories by showing how chemicals and activity in different parts of
the brain impact behavior. Most importantly, it has been demonstrated that
Jung was indeed correct. While each person is unique, a part of that person—
a core, if you will—is solid and steady. It is that core that the MBTI, and the
Color Q system, define and apply to a multitude of life issues. 
I developed Color Q as a quick introduction to the concepts of personality
typing. When running team-building and leadership seminars for my corporate
clients like the U.S. Treasury, Bank of America, Northern Trust, Merrill Lynch,
the Government of Pennsylvania Leadership Institute, UBS, and Prudential
Insurance, among others, I also asked participants to fill out an investment
questionnaire. From this pool of knowledge emerged the Money Q profiles,
14
PA R T  1  |  T H E  J U M P  S TA R T

which explain how different personality types approach money and compen-
sation. Several results of this proprietary research are presented in chapter 26,
which sheds light on how individuals approach the financial negotiation
aspects of their job search.

Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney
Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney understands that leadership and success
come from first mastering the issues, cultivating alliances, and then mustering
all your resources. For nine terms she has represented the 12th district of
New York City in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2015, the nonpartisan
website Govtrack.us ranked her as the number one Democrat in the House
for leadership and the number two member in Congress for the number of
cosponsors her bills and resolutions attracted. She was the first woman to
chair the Joint Economic Committee and is a nationally recognized leader in
the fields of economic policy, financial services, national security, and
women’s issues. She was the powerhouse behind the landmark credit card
reform legislation that an independent study found saves consumers $12 bil-
lion annually.1
“I have learned how to pull together bipartisan support, and that has really
been the key in passing many important bills that people thought could never
overcome the opposition of special interests,” says Maloney, demonstrating
the Green/Red’s dynamic initiation and ability to persuade. Her alliance with
Republican Marcia Blackburn of Tennessee to pass a bill aimed at establishing
a National Women’s History Museum is one good example of her ability to
C H A P T E R  4  |
G R E E N S  O V E R A L L
19

reach across the aisle, find areas of agreement, and build alliances. In one ses-
sion alone, she introduced over seventy pieces of legislation, tying the record
for the most from any legislator. 
Her tireless efforts over the course of a decade led to the passage of a bill
that provided badly needed healthcare for New York’s ailing 9/11 first respon-
ders. Her dogged perseverance won her plaudits and admiration around the
world. “If you believe passionately in and understand fully the importance of
the goal,” says Maloney, “it’s not work. And no obstacle can withstand the
unwavering determination of a united people committed to a just cause.” She
is also proud of having helped draft the Anti-Terrorism Intelligence Report
Act, which changed the structure of the U.S. intelligence system.
Along with being a national leader on many issues, she is primarily driven
by her deep concern for her New York constituents. Maloney secured critical
federal funding for the badly needed Second Avenue subway, the largest infra-
structure project in the country. And she recently prevented the closing of a
veteran’s hospital on Twenty-Third Street. “Sometimes, it’s not what you do,
it’s what you stop,” she said in 2012.2 Her efforts to keep post offices open and
fund schools in her district have been decidedly Green endeavors. She is cur-
rently leading an effort to secure two giant pandas from China for a New York
City zoo, to not only bring delight to millions of children but to engage
people in thoughtful conversations on a wide variety of environmental issues.
She also has a feisty Red side, and her opponents know she is no easy
target. A strong proponent of women’s rights, she was a chief sponsor of the
Equal Rights Amendment and author of the Debbie Smith Act that funds the
processing of DNA evidence in sexual assault cases. She has stood firm
against right-wing efforts to roll back the historic gains of women. And when
Rep. Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, chaired a religious-freedom
and birth-control panel with no female witnesses, Maloney rocked the
hearing with her simple question: “Where are the women?” A picture of the
all-male panel of witnesses along with her question appeared in news outlets
all over the country the next day. Her response to conflict is typical of a
Green/Red Extrovert: “I deal with it in steps. A lot of it is educating people,
and listening to all points of view, to see if there is a way to move forward
together. I encourage people to try more listening. It really works.”
News Personality Diane Sawyer
Before stepping down from her anchor position to spend time with her hus-
band, Mike Nichols, in his final days, ABC News television journalist Diane
20
PA R T  2  |  G R E E N S

Sawyer was one the best-known Greens in the United States. She epitomizes
many of the group’s artistic and interpersonal skills. 
In high school she won the U.S. Junior Miss pageant and after college
moved to Washington, DC, to serve as assistant to Richard Nixon’s White
House press secretary, Ron Ziegler. 
In 1978, she took a job with CBS, but Dan Rather and other senior figures
were vocal about the presence of someone tainted by Watergate. She
ultimately won over her colleagues with her incredible stamina, spending a
week at the State Department during the Iranian hostage crisis, sleeping no
more than an hour a day. They also were disarmed by her typical Green charm
and ability to let her ego go for the sake of the story.
Working with, instead of against, her natural Green core traits led to a string
of successes. In 1981, she was promoted to the CBS Morning News Show; in
1984 she became the first female correspondent on the prestigious 60 Minutes.
Greens are among the most intuitive of all the Color types. In 1989, Sawyer
jumped to ABC to coanchor the news magazine Prime Time Live, which
became 20/20. As of this writing, she has begun to make special appearances,
such as hosting the live broadcast of The Sound of Music and doing the last
interview with Caitlyn Jenner prior to her transition in April 2016.
Diane Sawyer evinces the typical polarities of the Green personality: the
ability to be earnest and irreverent, intense and funny, authoritative and vul-
nerable. True to her type, she is both intensely private and genuinely
interested in people.
The people in Sawyer’s group, the Greens, need opportunities to use their
creativity and to impact the lives of others. They excel in verbal and written
communications and are heavily represented among writers, TV anchors, and
biographers. In corporate settings, they excel in sales, marketing, and public
relations. Whatever the work setting, they thrive when their uniqueness is
recognized. Harmony and authenticity bring out a Green’s best.
Pulitzer Prize winner Frank McCourt, author of Angela’s Ashes, ’Tis, and
Teacher Man, expressed Green characteristics through his teaching and writ-
ings. For thirty years he taught high school English in New York City.
Defying established guidelines, he turned his own poverty-soaked back-
ground in the slums of Ireland into a valuable lesson plan. Without losing
his humor or sense of compassion, he described the fleas in his mattress; the
smell of one toilet shared by an entire street; and the foibles of his alcoholic
father and depressed mother. In so doing, he formed a powerful bond with
his students.

Greens often are found at the forefront of human-interest causes. Actress
Angelina Jolie is special envoy to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees. She has traveled worldwide in her role as spokesperson for war-
traumatized children and refugees. While it is not unusual for celebrities to
adopt humanitarian causes, the kind of fervor and commitment Jolie brings
to hers is.
She is known for her work on the ground, making some forty field missions
for her refugee work alone in addition to multimillion-dollar relief donations.3
She was recognized in 2005 with the United Nations Global Humanitarian
Action Award. She has received an honorary damehood from the Order of St.
Michael and St. George, as well as the 2013 Jean Hersholt Humanitarian
Award, given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Jolie made
repeated headlines with her three adoptions of children from impoverished
overseas circumstances. In a 2016 visit to a refugee camp in Jordan during
which she noticed the large percentage of children in residence, Jolie said that
“like any other parent, it would be impossible for me to imagine what it would
be like for my own children in this situation. And it breaks my heart.”4 Jolie’s
numerous causes and the large amount of time she devotes to them are excel-
lent examples of the Green personality’s focus on the needs and feelings of oth-
ers. Whether in her personal or public life, her empathetic efforts to help
others are notable for their consistency and authenticity.
Making a difference in the world is paramount for the Green personality.
Other famous Greens in the news and entertainment world are singer
Adele, Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Aniston, Sandra Bullock, Katie Couric, and
Jane Fonda. Barack Obama, Mahatma Gandhi, Mikhail Gorbachev, and
Eleanor Roosevelt illustrate the Green leadership style in politics; Arianna
Huffington, co-founder of The Huffington Post, she is also a Green. Ralph
Waldo Emerson was a well-known Green writer and so is J. K. Rowling.
Abraham Maslow was a Green psychologist. Pope John Paul XXIII and
Mother Teresa were prominent Greens in the religious field, as is Pope
Francis.
This chapter will help you determine if you’ve tested your primary and
backup personality Colors correctly. It also will help you identify Greens
among people you know, as will chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid:
Adjusting to Other Styles.” 
If the self assessment at the beginning of the book has scored you as a
Green, you are brilliant with people and communications issues. More than
the other three Colors, you will enjoy this book because it will help you learn
22

even more about people. You are likely to Color code everyone you know and
test the tips supplied here for communicating with them. 
Of all the Colors, your skills are more often (unfairly) considered “soft.”
This book will show how they can be put to economic advantage. Your highly
developed marketing abilities make you a top choice for creating lasting prod-
uct brands. Your people skills calm turbulent teams and departments in
record time. Staff turnover can be staunched by putting a Green in charge;
productivity spikes when a Green is in charge of a team.

fessional satisfaction and success.

YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Green, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Gold personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Extrovert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being with others, rather than being
alone. You are compassionate, persuasive, loyal, and have a talent for predict-
ing future trends. 
You Overall
You are outgoing, sociable, warm, and articulate. Green/Gold Extroverts are
gifted communicators with an unusual ability to influence. Those you admire
receive your deep loyalty. In return, you expect equal appreciation. This can
lead to frustration and disappointment. 
You have an abundance of innate emotional intelligence and interact well
with most Color types. You operate best in harmonious groups. Driven by
intuition, foresight, and compassion, you excel at leading others to achieve
their potential. You are exceptionally skilled at projecting the trends and pit-
falls of the future.
People who are rude or bully others are a major irritant. You respond well to
praise but are easily hurt by criticism. This makes you appear touchy, as even the
most well-intentioned criticism may fluster you. Actual conflict disturbs you
(except when standing up to rude bullies, which you do with steely strength).
Green/Gold Extroverts
CHAPTER 5

You are enthusiastic, with the energy to work on several projects at once.
Decisive and often in a hurry, you can be more than a little impatient with any-
one who slows you down. While it is your nature to be supportive, you can be
both critical and confrontational when your standards are not being met.
Your interest in others is so strong that you run the risk of not giving
enough time to yourself. In both personal and professional relationships, you
make others feel valued and liked. 
CASE STUDY ONE
Financial Executive
Alexandra Lebenthal, CEO of Lebenthal and Company, comes from a storied
Wall Street family. Her grandparents, Louis and Sayra Lebenthal, founded
Lebenthal & Co., Inc., in 1925. Alexandra joined Lebenthal in 1988 and became
president and CEO in 1995—at age 31, the youngest-ever female president of
a brokerage firm. 
Despite an earlier interest in becoming an actress (a career attractive to
Greens), Alexandra allowed herself to be groomed by her grandmother to take
over the family business. Upon doing so, she received high marks from her
Wall Street peers, particularly for the quality of her advertising and brand
positioning. Green/Golds are creative abstract thinkers and gifted at position-
ing products and ideas. Alexandra says, “We came up with a commercial line
that announced, ‘I have a mission to make you a customer for life, and all I
have to do is put your needs first.’” Treating clients like members of the family
differentiated her firm’s client service and satisfied Alexandra’s Green side. 
Her natural Green/Gold ability to predict future trends alerted Alexandra to
new product offerings that kept Lebenthal and Company strong, profitable,
and ultimately marketable. It sold to Advest Group in 2001 for $25 million. In
2005, Merrill Lynch acquired Advest and laid the Lebenthal name to rest.
Alexandra’s noncompete clause expired in mid-2006, and she resurrected the
family firm in 2007. 
When heading a firm, she embodies the typical democratic management
style of her Color. “I want the people who report to me to feel that they are a
meaningful part of shaping the company,” she says, “and shaping me as a
leader.” A passionate supporter of women in business, she was named one of
the top fifty Women in Wealth Management by Wealth Manager Magazine.1
She has also been named to Crain’s New York Top Women Owned Businesses2
and Crain’s Fastest 50 Growing Businesses3 in New York.

Greens are often drawn to writing, and Alexandra published her first novel,
Recessionistas, in August 2010, which sold to Sony Television. As one of the
most recognizable women on Wall Street, she is an official CNBC contributor
and frequent commentator in the media.
CASE STUDY TWO
Human Resources Business Partner
Fiona Thompson is an approachable young woman whose intelligent eyes
communicate her interest in you almost immediately. She is also an excellent
example of how a Green’s supposedly “soft” interpersonal skills can save a
company a lot of money. Fiona is a human resources business partner for First
Midwest Bank, a fast-growing, Chicago-based, community-focused bank
with over one hundred branches in three states. 
One of the biggest assets a company possesses (particularly a larger, pub-
licly traded one like First Midwest) is its workforce. It also can be one of its
most economically draining if mishandled. Fiona partners with senior manage-
ment to develop and deploy all aspects of effective workforce planning, includ-
ing employee development and handling complex employee relations
investigations. Fiona says, “I especially enjoy advising and coaching man-
agers on employee relations matters such as succession planning, perform-
ance concerns, and engagement issues.” 
While her high emotional intelligence benefits her company by minimizing
employee turnover and reducing, Fiona also sees a downside. “Sometimes I
am too empathetic and struggle when balancing the needs of the business
and employees,” she says. The added value of her unique interpersonal skills
really offsets this, however. “I love engaging with people—listening to
employee feedback and acting as quarterback in pulling people from different
departments to collaborate on new solutions to problems.” This keeps her
motivated to handle her role’s many intricacies. 
When employee interactions involve conflict or having to give constructive
feedback, Fiona has learned to wall off her natural Green sensitivity. “I alter
my communication style to be more in tune with the other’s personality,” she
says. (Greens do this naturally and easily.) It’s the walling-off effort that
requires more energy and discipline on her part, as it goes against a Green’s
nature (but would be easy for a Blue).

C H A P T E R  5  |
G R E E N / G O L D  E X T R O V E R T S
27
At her previous job with the Urban Land Institute in Washington, DC, Fiona
“helped open up offices in foreign countries, which required learning about
human resources practices that differed significantly from those in the United
States.” She hopes to continue traveling the world for business advancement
and pleasure. Extroverted Green Fiona thrives on meeting and interacting
with new people. 
She likes to throttle down in her private time, however. “I read or listen to
music to provide some quiet time to balance all the human interaction of my
day.”
Overall, Fiona is in a position that suits her very well. “I like feeling that my
job matters,” she says. “That I have, in a small way, made the lives of our
employees better, so they are more productive in advancing our company’s
mission.” 
CASE STUDY THREE
Marketing Executive, Finance
Adam Ozmer is an effective Green in a corporate America predominantly run
by Golds and Blues. He has turned his innate visionary ability into a career as
head of marketing for the New York Stock Exchange, governance services.
“I work with a team to devise strategy and execution plans to market prod-
ucts to compliance officers and boards of directors,” Adam explains. “We
develop messaging, advertising, strategic partnerships, campaigns, and sales
enablement with the intent of driving significant growth in our business.”
In college, Adam aspired to be a magazine editor but diverted from that
course during his senior year. “I interned at Christie’s Auction House in New
York, and they placed me in the marketing department,” he says. “I really
loved it, and the experience started me down a different road.”
His first job was in the advertising department of Circuit City Corporate as
an assistant media buyer. Advertising-agency, corporate-marketing, and
branding stints followed. “I have experience across both business-to-business
marketing and business-to-consumer marketing . . . with the heaviest concen-
tration in marketing professional and financial services products,” Adam
says. Here his Green visionary capabilities work well. “I’m very strong on
looking at the big picture and devising a plan forward. Ideating what
something might look like in its end state is a joy for me,” Adam says.

28
PA R T  2  |  G R E E N S
Although he can effectively venture into the Red’s technology territory, he
is less comfortable. “I tend to involve myself in the early stages of figuring out
technology needs and specifications but remove myself from the middle
stages of working through the gritty stuff,” he says. “In sorting out the minute
details, I can either become completely absorbed and obsessed with working
through each one . . . or I can gloss over details in my drive to get to the end
state.” This is a classic Green/Gold conflict; he values colleagues who help
him stay on track.
Adam hits his stride when projects demand imagination and innovation. “I
love the creative side of my job; starting with a blank page and figuring out
what to do.” When he starts new departments, “There’s tremendous freedom
in creating your own process and establishing something new.” 
Adam recharges by doing simple physical activities that provide a mental
break from technology and routine, like walking his dog or working around his
1830s Connecticut weekend house.
But the Green artistic soul in Adam yearns for greater expression than the
corporate milieu provides. “I have always had a strong desire to work in a
more creative field . . . outside of corporate America,” he says. “I can’t artic-
ulate what that job looks like or sounds like, but it’s simpler and more artisti-
cally focused. I think (hope) I’ll know it when I see it . . . one day.”
You on the Job
AS A LEADER
A people-centered, idealistic vision drives your enthusiastic style. You respect
the needs and opinions of staff at all levels, influencing with persuasion rather
than control. Consensus and cooperation are your goals. You provide your
people sensitive and appropriate support through personal difficulties. 
Your Gold side introduces structure and organization and initiates action.
You are usually upbeat, accepting setbacks as new challenges rather than
defeats.
AS A TEAM PLAYER
If a team is stalled by interpersonal conflict, you are the bridge builder.
Others understand that you merely want to achieve stated objectives. Rather
than being dictatorial, you energize the team with enthusiasm and a warm
sense of humor. You inspire former combatants to their best combined

efforts. Because you are focused and results oriented, it’s rare that your team
misses a deadline.
Look at figure 5–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths. 
FIGURE 5–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Excite others with high-quality ideas and enthusiasm
H Organize people and resources
H Build morale, loyalty, and productivity
H Mentor others well, exponentially increasing your value to the firm
H Create harmonious teams; turn around troubled departments
H Think creatively; see future trends
Now see how another Green/Gold Extrovert uses his strengths in a very
different field.
Ideal Work Environment
Alexandra and Fiona each gravitated to environments where they have
control of products or services that contribute in some way to the well-being
of society. These are key elements of Green/Gold Extrovert satisfaction.
When a job offer is made, leverage as much as you can from the list in
figure 5–2.
FIGURE 5–2 The Ideal Green/Gold Extrovert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. If these
descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve tested your Color correctly.
Other Colors, especially Golds, would find this environment uncomfortable
and unproductive. The optimal Green/Gold Extrovert work environment:
H Is harmonious, with people who can be trusted. Backbiting and internal
competition are discouraged and viewed as unproductive. 
C H A P T E R  5  |
G R E E N / G O L D  E X T R O V E R T S
29

H Has strong values that align with your own. Its mission is to produce
products and services that contribute to the well-being of society.
H Makes good use of your well-developed organizational skills. Your proj-
ects draw on your people, communications, and organizational skills
simultaneously. 
H Allows responsibility for one’s own projects. You see a big picture and
possess the ability to excite others about it. When you work too long on
someone else’s project, his or her constraints may leave you feeling
frustrated and unfulfilled.
H Provides ongoing new learning experiences. You’re enthused by assign-
ments that publicize new products or services, learn or teach new tech-
nologies, create promotional strategies, discover new markets, or
require continuing education. 
The worst type of work culture for an Extroverted Green/Gold is tense,
overly competitive, and highly political. It is secretive about critical informa-
tion, rewarding power plays over productivity. The atmosphere is impersonal
among management, staff, and coworkers. The company compromises your
core values; it exploits its workers and its customers.
While Green/Gold Extroverts can progress in such corporate cultures, your
interpersonal talents usually must remain low-key in order to survive.
Productivity and accomplishment are stunted, and career achievements
become an uphill climb.
The Extroverted Green/Gold’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a great boss is pretty hard to leave. Green/Golds get on especially well
with other Greens. But bosses of the Color types who possess the skills in fig-
ure 5–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 5–3 The Green/Gold Extrovert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Is insightful
H Asks you about your vision for the project, the company, or your career
30
PA R T  2  |  G R E E N S

H Gives positive feedback and stresses areas where he or she agrees
with you
H Is organized and delivers on commitments—a good role model
H Shares the same values of improving the world
Careers That Attract Green/Gold Extroverts
As our case studies illustrate, you have deep personal values and care about the
needs of others (on the Green side) and value organization (on the Gold side). 
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals
to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color-style characteristics that create suc-
cess in that broad area. 
According to our research, jobs italicized in the lists below are predicted

CASE STUDY FOUR
When a Career Isn’t Working
Buddy Coleman (a composite of the author’s clients) sold insurance for fifteen
years for a leading company. He really enjoyed dealing with customers and
took pride that he was helping them shape their futures in positive ways. 
After fifteen years, this was no longer enough. The amount of paperwork
had increased over the years, something that Green/Gold Extroverts find suf-
focating. Dealing with concrete events and practical rules-based questions
had burned him out. He craved something (anything!) that would engage his
Green/Gold’s preferred focus on the big picture.
At a meeting of his professional insurance sales organization, he was
intrigued to hear that the long-time director was retiring and a search was on
to replace her. Buddy immediately expressed his interest to an attending
board member and was strongly encouraged to submit a resume. Today, he
directs the efforts of twelve volunteers and flexes his Green/Gold creativity
writing a monthly “Future Trends” column for the organization’s glossy
newsletter. He has increased the number of membership events by 50 percent
and attends each one, providing the people contact that this Green/Gold
always enjoyed.
Your Personality’s Challenges
Green/Gold Extroverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind
spots. Some listed below you have, others you don’t. Tone down a blind spot
by focusing on it, then choose more-productive actions and make them
habits. (Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q Avoid conflicts and confrontations. (You take conflict and criticism
very personally and protect yourself by avoidance. Instead, face it.
Build a thicker skin by repeated exposure, on your terms.)
C H A P T E R  5  |
G R E E N / G O L D  E X T R O V E R T S
33

Q Tend not to recognize underperforming workers or manipulative
friends/relatives. (Don’t shove aside that little alarm bell inside.
Memorize this phrase and speak up immediately: “I see you [are/are
not] doing X. I want to say something now so you don’t think I’m OK
with this going forward.”)
Q Base important decisions too much on likes and dislikes and not
enough on facts, figures, and research. (Guide yourself by your likes
and dislikes, but force yourself to assemble a few facts and figures. See
what happens when you consider this new input.)
Q Can irritate others by being moralistic. (Practice saying: “And now, I’ll
get off my soapbox! But do you agree? How would you handle it?”)
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Green/Gold Extroverts have outstanding people skills. Many interviewers are
Greens, with whom you’ll feel an immediate rapport. But with interviewers of
other Colors, you need to rehearse different communications styles. 
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Organize and execute a comprehensive job-search campaign
Q Network widely to get leads
Q Impress your interviewer with your verbal skills and confidence
Q Project your past experience into new fields or functions
In order to avoid your blind spots, you need to:
Q Thoroughly check out the facts about a position rather than rely on
intuition
Q Slow down in making decisions until there has been sufficient reflection
Q Not take rejection personally
Q Not be too accommodating in discussing your compensation pack-
age. Treat the process as a chess game to increase respect and com-
pensation
34
PA R T  2  |  G R E E N S

The Green/Gold Extrovert’s Interviewing Style
You’ll feel immediate rapport with an interviewer whose Color is close to your
own. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly different
style, use the suggestions in the parentheses below. 
In following your natural style, you will:
Q Express yourself with warmth and passion. (Tone it down with a
cooler type of interviewer.)
Q Stress the big picture first and place less emphasis on the details of
your experience and goals. (Some interviewers prefer sequential or
chronological presentations. If so, avoid brainstorming and
metaphoric language.)
Q Try to personalize the relationship as quickly as possible. (If you are
greeted coolly and the interviewer seems analyzing and detached, be
formal. Focus only on answering the questions succinctly.)
Q Avoid subjects that cause conflict. (Rehearse difficult questions ahead
of time, such as: Why did you leave your last job? What are your weak-
nesses? What would your former boss say about you? Do you have
budgeting skills?)
Q Have trouble negotiating salary and other financial issues. (Research
comparable pay and standard benefits. If you have a strong resume,
don’t hesitate to ask for more, saying, “With my qualifications, I’m
expecting X.” If they still lowball you, leave. You’ll respect yourself,
and you may get a counteroffer.)
Q Think on your feet and respond quickly; talk more than listen. (Active
listening is essential to understand the interviewer’s priorities. Prepare
a list of questions important to you, and listen closely to the answers.)
Okay, go do something with friends or family now. Later, check out chapter
19, “Golds Overall,” to learn about the strengths of your secondary Color.
Read chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other Styles,”

YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Green, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Gold personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Introvert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being alone rather than being with peo-
ple. Your Color group’s members are a curious combination of warmth and
reserve. Sharing primarily with those closest to you, you don’t reveal much to
others until trust is established. You have deep insights into people and enjoy
helping them grow. Although an idealist, you also are good at organizing and
following through on projects.
You Overall
Intuition, foresight, and compassion drive Green/Gold Introverts, who excel
at understanding and motivating others to achieve their greatest potential.
You have a deep need for empathetic relationships, but your intimate group
is small. Appearing cool and detached outwardly, you harbor strong feelings
about your loved ones and your values. When those values are violated or
those people threatened, you surprise others by shedding your easygoing
nature and becoming tough, demanding, and aggressive.
Because you are a keen and penetrating observer, you know what motivates
others. You have a good handle on the cosmic drama around you. Routine sti-
fles you, but you take life as it comes and do what you must.
Green/Gold Introverts
CHAPTER 6

A harmonious environment, where your originality and interpersonal
skills are used to organize and inspire, is a necessity. You enjoy exercising
your considerable emotional intelligence in circumstances where it is appre-
ciated. Very loyal to individuals, causes, and institutions you admire, you
expect a high degree of loyalty and support in return.
Others see you as patient, creative, committed, stubborn, and somewhat
enigmatic. In relationships, you are supportive and affirming, making people
you care about feel valued and liked. Conflicts at home and work are prob-
lematic and will be ignored as long as possible.
Green/Gold Introverts are tactful, complex, and articulate. Some of the
words that describe your work ethic are conscientious, goal-oriented, orderly,
serious, hardworking, and ambitious. You are decisive and often in a hurry,
impatient with anyone who slows you down in achieving objectives. You can
be so ambitious that you’ll actually do more than the task requires. 
Creative and full of penetrating insights, you are gifted at predicting trends.
This also allows you to solve problems in new ways. 
As an Introvert, you get fatigued and cranky working in open office
settings or when your privacy is not respected. Yet your interest in others is
so strong that you run the risk of not giving yourself that all-important time
alone to recharge. 
The people who irritate you most are superficial or rude, or invade your
privacy. When angered, you become critical and confrontational. In the
second half of your life, you handle these folks better, using your superior
verbal abilities to extricate yourself from the web of their agendas. You realize
that you are not obligated to help everyone who needs it. 
You on the Job
AS A LEADER 
“Work hard to convert ideals into reality” is your mantra. You see an idealized
vision of the future (usually farther out than most can envision) and strive to
make it happen. Building consensus and cooperation through persuasion
rather than control is the Green/Gold Introvert’s hallmark. You give all opin-
ions an airing, bringing out people’s best through appreciation and support. 
Naturally and almost fiercely committed to your work, you have integrity
about what you do. You are an outstanding role model, inspiring others to
great heights. But you don’t just sit in your office and dream; you get out
there, putting real-world structures and organization into place to achieve
C H A P T E R  6  |
G R E E N / G O L D  I N T R O V E R T S
37

your goals. Accepting setbacks as simply new challenges, you sometimes find
startlingly new and better ways to meet goals. When staffers have professional
or personal difficulties, you are there for them in appropriate ways. 
AS A TEAM PLAYER
Since your goal is harmony, you build bridges (often with humor) between con-
flicting factions. The focus is on results and providing the structure to achieve
them. You brainstorm multiple ideas, get people laughing about the one that
really will work, and inspire their best efforts before they finish chuckling.
Although you navigate emotional territory well, you have your practical
side. You meet deadlines and ensure that human and material resources are
not wasted. 
You may irritate teammates by sticking to ideas not shared by the rest of
the team.
Look at figure 6–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
Now see how some Green/Gold Introverts use these strengths in very dif-
ferent fields.
FIGURE 6–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Are visionary; you can see trends and far-reaching potentials of situations.
H Coach and mentor others well, giving diplomatic feedback.
H Organize projects well and ensure timely follow-through.
H Recognize the right people for the right task.
H See new ways to solve problems and express solutions in a clear way.
CASE STUDY ONE
Award-Winning Playwright
Lonnie Carter has been a professional playwright since 1969, when he gradu-
ated from the Yale School of Drama in New Haven, Connecticut. He saw his
first live play at age 19, a Tennessee Williams work that formed a lasting
impression of the theater. “I liked what language did in plays,” he recalls. “I
38
PA R T  2  |  G R E E N S

C H A P T E R  6  |
G R E E N / G O L D  I N T R O V E R T S
39
felt I could do something, if not similar, then complementary, with the use of
language. It makes me feel good; I have fun doing it.”
Lonnie has taught at Columbia and New York Universities, an occupation
that has energized and inspired him. “Students will suck you dry,” Lonnie
admits. “But I like my students; some I like enormously. I love hearing from a
student five years down the road saying, ‘I’m in a play in San Diego that’s a
great success; thank you.’ That’s thrilling. Two students, both Latinos, were
about to kill each other in my class. That was seven or eight years ago. Now
they make films, really good ones, together. Christopher Gabriel Nunez and
Saila Reyes. Look out for them.”
Although he never experienced overnight success as a playwright, he
recently won a Village Voice OBIE Award (off-Broadway theater’s highest
honor) for his work The Romance of Magno Rubio. He attributes his success to
persistence. “Each year was just another step in the process,” Lonnie says.
“Then it was forty years of steps.” Now he is so busy going from one production
to another that “I seem to write in moving vehicles more than anything else!”
Lonnie does not like the air travel that cuts into his creative time or the
bureaucracy of working within a large university structure. “Bureaucrats
everywhere and nary a brain in sight,” he complains. Out of the university sys-
tem once and for all, he devotes his time to his own writing and the raising of
his children, even though three of the four are now grown. “There will always
be raising to do,” he sighs, happily.
CASE STUDY TWO
Senior Vice President, Public Relations, Healthcare 
Maggie Hoffman is a master in the management of perception. Her public
relations savvy is brought into play every day as she assesses and manages
the opinions of important groups and individuals for her clients. Though her
job is to make her clients look good, Maggie didn’t mention one of the meas-
ures of her own success—we had to hear it from her subordinates. They call
themselves MITs—“Maggies in Training.” 
In keeping with her Green/Gold personality, Maggie does three things very
well. She discerns future trends and does quality research to back up her pre-
dictions. She is a superior communicator with clients and staff. Finally, she
stays focused on maximizing billable hours and productivity while avoiding
costly staff burnout.

She is very structured in how she produces work and how she thinks
things through, note those who work with her. These are the qualities of her
Gold component. Of her Green side, Maggie says, “Most satisfying to me is
knowing people on my teams are engaged, challenged, and happy.” 
Her associates say Maggie is the go-to person on their team for clients
seeking business advice and resources. This is unusual in the public relations
industry and speaks to her professional credibility. 
Maggie stresses out when involved in group activities that are not well-
orchestrated. Cold calling and prospecting, functioning under huge time
crunches and managing people during crisis phases are her least favorite
work situations. But when she nails the right strategy for a particular client or
brand, she feels deeply energized. 
Ideal Work Environment
Your ideal work environment allows you to contribute in some way to the
well-being of society. Other than that, you’re flexible.
When a job offer is made, leverage as much as you can from the list in
figure 6–2.
FIGURE 6–2 The Ideal Green/Gold Introvert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. Check all
that ring true for you. If these descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve
tested your individual color correctly. Other Colors, especially Blues, would
find this environment uncomfortable and unproductive. The optimal
Green/Gold Introvert work environment:
H Has people who can be trusted.
H Rewards creativity.
H Is an egalitarian culture with strong values and a willingness to invest in
staff development.
H Produces products and services that contribute to the well-being of
society.
H Provides opportunity to work on a variety of activities.
H Offers control of and responsibility for your own projects.
40
PA R T  2  |  G R E E N S

H Rewards your well-developed organizational skills.
H Allows for quiet time, reflection, minimal paperwork, and private work
space.
The worst type of work culture for a Green/Gold Introvert is tense, overly
competitive, and highly political. Here the creative drive is crushed, and
Green/Gold Introverts become critical and defensive. Any work culture where
products or services exploit both staff efforts and customer vulnerabilities is
intolerable to the Green/Gold Introvert. You desire deeply to contribute pos-
itively to the world. Requiring focus on too many details or being too hierar-
chical and status conscious also are work cultures that destroy your creativity
and productivity.
When Green/Gold Introverts work in such nonideal corporate cultures,
productivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Introverted Green/Gold's Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Green/Golds get along espe-
cially well with other Greens. But bosses of other Color types who possess the
characteristics in figure 6–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 6–3 The Green/Gold Introvert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Has high integrity
H Shares your values
H Personalizes your relationship
H Supports staff through obstacles
H Protects you from office politics
Careers That Attract Green/Gold Introverts
Like Lonnie and Maggie, you are most attracted to careers that provide recog-
nition for your creativity or that help others grow and develop. Green/Gold
Introverts need to work with people who can be trusted. Working alone or in
small groups is best, ideally allowing for private space and quiet time.

CASE STUDY THREE
The Successful Green/Gold Introvert
Dr. Mobarak Abdulhadi Aldosari has been at the forefront of the career guid-
ance and counseling field in Saudi Arabia for the past twenty-five years. He
helped establish the first Guidance Center in the kingdom’s Eastern Province
in 1998. His Ph.D. in guidance and counseling “matches my personality type,”
he says.
Dr. Aldosari’s work with Color Q demonstrates the method’s applicability
across cultures. He owns the Rowad Almaarefa Educational Consulting Firm
in Saudi Arabia and is a Color Q licensee. “I have conducted the Color Q
Personality System on more than 70,000 students (boys and girls), teachers,
and counselors in the Arab Gulf Countries. This is really what our people
want,” he says.
Dr. Aldosari is a highly intuitive Green/Gold Introvert who describes his
professional strengths as wanting to help others, motivate them, and see
them succeed. He says that career guidance isn’t available yet in many of his
kingdom’s schools. “I was most frustrated when one day I asked a grade 12
high school student about his dream. He answered, ‘I am not thinking about it
yet.’ That shocked me and led me to work and concentrate on the career guid-
ance field.” 
Today, he focuses on helping students find their career paths and works
with the private sector for employees and leaders. 
Your Personality’s Challenges
Green/Gold Introverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some listed below you have, others you don’t. Tone down a blind spot by
focusing on it, then choose more productive actions and make them habits.
(Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q Can be too idealistic and ignore bottom-line consequences. (There is a
practical side to making an ideal real. The benefits you envision may
be prohibitively expensive. Consult Golds and Blues about processes
and costs.)
Q Don’t have a talent for politics. (Find a boss or other superior who can
shield you from such things. If you become embroiled, just refuse to
play—walk away. Strangely, that works most of the time.)

Q Avoid conflicts, confrontations, and underlying problems. (These
bring up strong emotions that you would rather not reveal. Don’t wait
until things boil over; it’s easier—and quicker—to address these prob-
lems when everyone is calm.)
Q Overpersonalize criticism. (You see criticism as a seismic rift in a rela-
tionship. Next time a friend criticizes you, ask if he or she still likes
you. Will you be surprised if they say, “Of course”? Much criticism is
well-meaning.) 
Q Go off on unrealistic tangents. (What’s possible in five years excites
you. But it won’t tell a Red what to do today, a Gold how to administer
today, or a Blue how to strategize the way there. Ask them, “What
should I do now to achieve this later?” You’ll get a lot more buy-in.) 
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Green/Gold Introverts need to be recognized for their unique creative ideas,
even during their job search. You find fun ways to rise to the top of the resume
pile. With some interviewers, particularly Greens and Golds, you will feel a
comfortable rapport. But for other Colors, you need to prepare responses.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Cull leads from a small but trusted network of friends and former asso-
ciates
Q Create a master plan using facts and intuition
Q Open yourself to new fields and unusual opportunities
Q Brainstorm trends and creative solutions, which can lead to new posi-
tions created for you
Q Follow through on calls and leads
Q Keep paperwork organized
Q Present yourself as committed and competent
Q Read the interviewer well
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Network with friends first; work up to contacting people you don’t
know
C H A P T E R  6  |
G R E E N / G O L D  I N T R O V E R T S
45

Q Research and understand a job’s compensation range (find a willing
Gold to help)
Q Talk more; sell your accomplishments
Q Stay practical about costs and the bottom line
Q De-emphasize the needs of others; prioritize your own
Q Practice your salary negotiation with a willing Red
Q Take rejection less personally (find another Green for encouragement)
The Green/Gold Introvert’s Interviewing Style
If your interviewer seems to have a significantly different personality style,
use the suggestions in parentheses. Mercilessly exploit these natural abilities
of yours and get more job offers. 
In following your natural style, you:
Q See the big picture and typically present that first. (Great if you’re
interviewing for a senior level position, irritating if for a junior slot. No
boss wants a subordinate who sees more on the horizon than he or she
does. Share only if asked, do not volunteer.)
Q Listen well with an unusual capacity to understand the viewpoints of
others. (This impresses many interviewers. Some, though, want to see
the tough professional. Focus on your viability for the job.)
Q Present in an orderly way. (Be prepared to show the pros and cons of
your background and goals. Use practical language; downplay
metaphors or abstractions with interviewers who speak concretely.) 
Q Use personal experiences to make your points. (If your interviewer
seems uncomfortable or breaks eye contact, cut it short.)
Okay, go do something cultural now. Later, check out chapter 19, “Golds
Overall.” Like all Colors, your blind spots can be complemented by the
strengths of others if you know where to look and how to ask. Invest time
learning how to recognize the Colors who can best assist you; it honestly will
make your life a whole lot easier. If you are actively engaging in a job search,
jot notes in the Roadmap in chapter 27. Recording your strengths and strate-
gies will keep you organized and on track, and provide a creative springboard
for your networking.

PA R T  2  |  G R E E N S

Green/Red Extroverts
YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Green, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Red personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Extrovert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being with people rather than being
alone. Green/Red Extroverts are warm, free spirits who often feel forced to
conform to norms of practicality set by other Colors. You’ll likely have more
career changes than other Colors, not because you’re unfocused but because
you are gifted, curious, and flexible. 
You Overall
Energized by new ideas, you’re intrigued by the unusual. Your deepest satis-
faction is to be acknowledged for your originality and unique contributions.
A free spirit, you are unconventional and admire the bravely creative.
A keen and penetrating observer, you know what motivates others. You’re
aware of what’s going on at any moment in the cosmic drama around you. You
love challenges that require you to be ingenious. Routine is a drag, but you
take life as it comes and do what you must.
If you’re not changing careers frequently, you definitely are changing proj-
ects and goals more often than other Colors. While you fear others may see
you as a flake, in reality they think of you as dynamic and highly skilled at
juggling lots of people and events, often simultaneously. 
CHAPTER 7

Have you taken up writing or public speaking yet? If not, you probably
want to. Your verbal and written skills are superior. You can convince employ-
ers that you can do the job, even if you’ve never done it before, and by the
way, do it better and more innovatively than anyone else. 
You are a gleeful warrior against bureaucracy. It is imperative that you be
allowed creative freedom, or you wither. 
A need for empathetic relationships is another driving force. Warm and
insightful, you establish rapport quickly by being genuine and nonjudgmental.
The trends and pitfalls of the future spread themselves out like a feast on
the banquet table of your intuition. Intuition drives you into many areas of
interest, almost against your will. Most areas have an impact on people or are
of global concern. 
The people who irritate you most are manipulative or controlling. In the
second half of your life, you’ll move toward a more objective and logical
approach to these people. You’ll use your superior verbal abilities to extricate
yourself from the web of their agendas. 
CASE STUDY ONE
Business Consultant
Greg is a typical Green/Red Extrovert who has carved out a niche in an
atypical field. In senior management of a leading strategy consulting firm he
has found success emphasizing the creative and relationship-building aspects
of the work.
Not surprisingly, Greg says, “It’s always been the hardest job for me to
be an analyst relentlessly focusing on detailed facts. I prefer the 80/20 rule,”
he says. “Find the key facts but don’t overdwell, then move on trusting your
intuition.” 
Greg is in charge of managing a team whose goal he describes as “leading
the client through change, which requires a strong point of view, persuasive
skills, and building trust.”
His biggest stress is having to act as an expert when he doesn’t feel like
one, since Green/Reds revere authenticity. He prefers long-term assignments;
it takes him about twelve months to really talk his clients’ talk with ease. 
Building relationships with staff and clients energizes him most, as it does
for most Green/Reds. He especially enjoys seeing ads and products from
clients he has helped. “I want to actually touch the products on the shelf and
bring them home and say, ‘I was part of this.’”

49
Greg describes his top three strengths as “motivating others, coaching,
and building relationships.” These are core Green/Red Extrovert strengths.
Also typical are his dreams for the future. He’d like to be a published poet
(most Green/Red Extroverts turn to writing at some point in their lives), a small
business owner, a photographer, or a nonprofit manager. Drawn to artistic and
socially relevant endeavors, Green/Red Extroverts also love working in
groups small enough to know everyone well.
You on the Job
AS A LEADER
Bringing out the best in people is your real gift. During the startup phase of a
company or project, you are a strong leader (particularly if conditions are
chaotic). You inspire confidence and support, and are able to rally others to
achieve difficult goals. Your understanding of what motivates people allows
you to create unwavering loyalty from your staff. Inviting everyone from all
levels to make suggestions brings forth unique ways to solve problems. You
then motivate with positive and constructive feedback during implementation. 
AS A TEAM PLAYER
Brainstorming is your bread and butter, and you’re better at it than almost
anyone. Contributing idea after idea, no matter how outrageous, you eventu-
ally find those tremendously creative ideas that put your company on the cut-
ting edge.
Others are at ease around your warmth, humor, and empowering can-do
attitude. They then generate ideas and offer resources that otherwise would
have been left dormant.
You may irritate teammates by talking too much and going off on tangents.
Look at figure 7–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 7–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Inspire others
H Express yourself in interesting and colorful ways

H Have ideas ahead of their time and can predict future trends by making
unusual connections
H Establish rapport quickly
H Build effective and loyal teams by respecting different points of view
H Network well within the organization
Now see how some Green/Red Extroverts use their strengths in very differ-
ent fields.
CASE STUDY TWO
Model, Actress, Interior Designer, Script Writer, Author
Gloria Parker’s face may be familiar to you—she was Oleg Cassini’s top model
and has appeared in numerous movies, television shows, and commercials. If
not her face, you may know her name as writer for television series like
Murphy’s Law and Tour of Duty. Perhaps you bought high-end furniture from
her upscale store on Montana Avenue in Los Angeles. If you were lucky
enough, you hired her to decorate your house, as movie stars Meg Ryan, Tom
Hanks, Pierce Brosnan, and Arnold Schwarzenegger did.
“I loved being on stage, making people laugh and cry,” says Gloria of her
acting career. “It opened a world to me I might not ever have walked into.” 
When her acting career wound down, Gloria, in typical Green/Red Extrovert
fashion, followed her heart and opened a furniture store, leveraging her show
business contacts to sell and create a custom-interior-design clientele. “I
enjoyed the artistic part, and I am really good at sales,” she says.
Green/Red Extroverts build extensive personal networks, and Gloria’s
helped her crack open the screenwriting world. “The first play I did [Women’s
Gym] got produced and sold to television!” she recalls, with her natural
enthusiasm.
Green/Red Extroverts love to be in the middle of things. Gloria is an espe-
cially good example. “It’s really exciting when TV shows are interviewing you,
you’re in the public eye, you’re young, and the world is at your feet,” she says.
“My store—the hottest people in California were coming to see me. And
when my first play was produced, there was so much attention—the reviews
were calling me brilliant and genius!”
When Green/Red Extroverts have done as much as they can enthusiasti-
cally and interest wanes in one career, they move on to the next exciting

thing. They are merely following their artistic core, which leads them like a
beacon to the next hot thing.
Gloria eventually burned out on the Los Angeles scene and, once again,
followed her heart. It led her to write a cutting-edge book about her son’s
transgender journey. Meeting Robyn was published in 2013, three years
before Caitlyn Jenner's transition garnered media attention. 
Although Gloria’s many careers bewilder other Colors, for her they were a
natural progression. “My deepest satisfaction is when something is completed
and beautiful and it gives pleasure to other people.”
CASE STUDY THREE
Fine Artist, Commercial Artist, Art Teacher
Oldrich Teply is one of the envied men who make art their living. His corporate
graphic work, fine art, and teaching fulfill him on many levels. Most energizing
to Oldrich is his teaching work at the renowned Art Students League in New
York City. Handling classes of fifty painting students, he gently and diplomati-
cally corrects errors in proportion, drawing, composition, or color. Green/Red
Extrovert teachers are known for their inspiring ways, and they love the con-
tact they have with their students. Oldrich can respond to different ages,
backgrounds, and skill levels with equal ease. He has the Green/Red core
desire to develop potential in others and is most pleased when a student
begins to show his or her own style.
For corporations, for example, he creates watercolors showcasing new
high-rise condominiums. Such assignments can involve studying blueprints
and conferring with architects and designers. Greens are particularly skilled
at pulling together diverse data to create one compelling visual that commu-
nicates the spirit of a project. 
At the request of Lou Gerstner, then-CEO of Nabisco, Oldrich drew twenty-
eight caricature portraits of the company’s new management team to ease
their transition. At the annual meeting, as the pictures flashed onscreen, the
humor Oldrich captured broke the tension surrounding the impending
changes. Humor is one tool Green/Reds use to create harmony.
The variety and creative freedom of his work are deeply fulfilling to Oldrich,
as is his minimal exposure to rules and bureaucracy. 

Ideal Work Environment
For Greg, it’s important that his clients know his heart is in the right place and
he truly wants to be of service. Wherever Green/Red Extroverts work, if high
value is placed on human well-being, they are happy. Green/Reds like Gloria
crave creativity and idea generation in a lively, fast-paced world.
When a job offer is made, leverage as much as you can from the list in
figure 7–2.
FIGURE 7–2 The Ideal Green/Red Extrovert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. Check all
that ring true for you. If these descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve
tested your individual Color correctly. Other Colors, especially Golds, would
find this environment uncomfortable and unproductive. The optimal Green/Red
Extrovert work environment:
H Is democratic and informal. Your title is less important than your ideas
and contributions.
H Encourages creativity and idea generation. It rewards you for your core
talents rather than labeling you as “free spirit” or “too far out.”
H Provides freedom to work at your own pace. The more you are controlled,
the less productive you become.
H Is lively and fast moving. You are energized by the new.
H Rewards humor and fun. A good laugh relaxes you and makes you want
to contribute more.
H Places high value on the well-being of staff and clients. Companies that
disrespect the human side make you fight rather than contribute pro-
ductively.
H Focuses on the startup stage rather than maintenance. You will find
ingenious ways to divest yourself of administrative details.
H Fosters cooperation and trust. Backstabbing and politics drain so much
energy from the task at hand. You have no patience for these.
H Provides good training and development opportunities. Self-improvement
is a lifelong pursuit.
52
PA R T  2  |  G R E E N S

The worst type of work culture for an Extroverted Green/Red emphasizes
routine and details, like the paperwork and accounting tasks Gloria hates.
Rules and procedures dominate, against which Green/Reds can’t help but
rebel. Highly political atmospheres destroy the creative freedom and trust
necessary for Green/Reds to contribute their best.
When Extroverted Green/Reds work in nonideal corporate cultures, pro-
ductivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Extroverted Green/Red's Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Green/Reds get along
especially well with other Greens. But bosses of other Color types who
possess the characteristics in figure 7–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 7–3 The Green/Red Extrovert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Is flexible
H Appreciates your authenticity and energy
H Has a sense of humor
H Personalizes your relationship
H Likes brainstorming new ideas and exploring new areas
H Provides frequent feedback
H Does not micromanage you
Careers That Attract Green/Red Extroverts

CASE STUDY FOUR
When a Career Isn’t Working
At age 52, Glen, a New York attorney, had just about achieved all his major
goals. Partner of a prestigious Wall Street law firm, Glen was respected and
lavishly compensated. His cases were high profile, the envy of his peers. Yet
for some reason he could not understand, Glen was finding it increasingly dif-
ficult to get up in the morning. He visited a therapist three times a week, seek-
ing answers without knowing the questions.

It turned out Glen had a classic case of burnout—a condition that results
when the job does not fit the needs of the personality. Glen had sailed through
law school on his smarts, fueled with the idealism that a law career could
make big differences in the world (something important to Green/Reds). 
In his early years at the firm, he worked long hours, energized by the cama-
raderie with his colleagues, as often is the case with this Color. Extroverted
Green/Reds recharge their batteries through supportive interaction at work.
This kept Glen going through the tough cases of his junior years. His outstanding
ability to make clients feel special and well served (another Green/Red core
aptitude) earned him an early partnership. This put him in high demand; ample
and excellent word-of-mouth recommendations attracted career-making cases.
Yet, at the top of his game, his reward was loss of interest and constant
fatigue. A brief introduction to his Color style brought several things to light.
As a Green, he disliked confrontation, the basis of most prominent cases. The
relentless drive for high-stakes settlements and the pressure of outwitting
opponents was draining rather than satisfying, as it would be to a Blue.
Glen resigned, much to the surprise of family, friends, and colleagues. He
enrolled in a university to earn a Ph.D. in psychology. Now, several years
later and brimming with energy, Glen is hanging up his shingle as a therapist
for lawyers.
Your Personality’s Challenges
Green/Red Extroverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some listed below you have, others you don’t. Tone down a blind spot by
focusing on it, then choose more-productive actions and make them habits.
(Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q Pay too little attention to rules you feel are obstacles to creativity. (Try
to understand whose anxiety a rule addresses. Remember, genuine cre-
ativity can work around, and through, the rules.)
Q Can go off on tangents during group discussions. (You think holisti-
cally; hence, all topics addressed in any order are relevant. Be consid-
erate of your fellow Colors who need linear thought and get jangled
when the lines aren’t straight!)
56
PA R T  2  |  G R E E N S

Q Are too sensitive to criticism. (Because relationships are top priority to
you, criticism feels like condemnation when it’s not. Dare to ask your
critics if they still like you. Most likely, they do.)
Q Avoid conflict, often delaying dealing with the issue. (Enjoy the real-
ization that conflict worked through to conclusion actually strengthens
relationships. If you are a young Green/Red, this is a very hard lesson
to learn. A thicker skin will bring you more and deeper relationships
in the long run.)
Q Get excited by new projects and then don’t complete old ones. (Most
projects get “old” before they’re complete, leaving unfinished business.
Just finish or delegate so your energy can flow to the new.)
Q Make errors of fact. (Gut feelings have always gotten you to the right
place at the right time; decisions based on facts often have led you
astray. Start intuitively, then prove yourself right. Other Colors need
facts and will devalue your ideas if they contain errors.) 
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Green/Red Extroverts love making a splash and impressing others. With some
interviewers, particularly Greens and Reds, you blow away all competitors.
With other Colors, you need a different strategy.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Actively network through a broad range of people for referrals.
Q Enjoy exploring new options.
Q Interview with enthusiasm.
Q Establish quick rapport.
Q Convince an employer to create a new job for you.
Q Come across as adaptable, a quick learner, and a team player.
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Role play negotiating salary and financial issues (find a willing Gold or
Blue to help).
Q Do more research on prospective companies.
C H A P T E R  7  |
G R E E N / R E D  E X T R O V E R T S
57

Q Subdue wardrobe, hairstyle, and manner in interviews to counterbal-
ance seeming lack of seriousness.
Q Talk less in interviews and ask more questions.
Q Hold back ideas on which you have not done cost research.
Q Require yourself to make a minimum number of contacts each day of
your job search.
Q Do a realistic budget for your job-search time.
Q Ask for a couple of days to give it further consideration; don’t jump at
a job offer. 
The Green/Red Extrovert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style, use the suggestions in parentheses. Mercilessly exploit these
natural abilities of yours and get more job offers. 
In following your natural style, you:
Q Speak with geniality, fluency, and energy. (You can overwhelm more
subdued interviewers. Try to match their energy.)
Q Think on your feet and reply quickly. (It’s possible to be too peppy. Mix
it up—make some replies slow and thoughtful.)
Q Make your points through lively and vivid imagery, personal stories,
and humor. (With an interviewer who keeps his or her distance,
replace imagery with facts—role play with a willing Gold, if possible.
Use personal stories only when interviewers maintain eye contact. If
humor falls flat the first time, don’t keep trying. Let the interviewer set
the tone.)
Q See the big picture and typically present that first. (Great if you’re
interviewing for a senior level position, irritating if for a junior slot. No
boss wants a subordinate who sees more on the horizon than he or she
does. Share only if asked.)
Okay, go do something new now. Or continue reading chapter 9, “Reds
Overall.” Then learn how to Color code bosses and coworkers by checking

out figure 24-1 in chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to
Other Styles.” The greatest value of this book really is learning how to interact
with, appreciate, and use the strengths of other Colors. If you’re doing a job
search, jot notes in the Roadmap in chapter 27—it will keep you focused. 
C H A P T E R  7  |
G R E E N / R E D  E X T R O V E R T S
59

YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Green, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Red personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Introvert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being alone rather than being with peo-
ple. Your Color group has warm, free spirits who typically feel forced to con-
form to norms of practicality and seriousness. You may have more career
changes than other Colors, not because you are flawed but because you are
multitalented, curious, and flexible. The drive to write is more intense in you
than in most other Colors and is a part of most of your jobs.
You Overall
Thoughtful, insightful, intuitive, and complex, you do not usually impose
your ideas on others. You prefer a small, intimate group of friends, even
though you have a deep need for empathetic relationships. Outwardly cool
and detached, you inwardly harbor strong feelings about people and values.
When your values are violated or those people threatened, you surprise
others by shedding your easygoing nature and becoming tough, demanding,
and aggressive.
Your deepest satisfaction is to be acknowledged for your originality and
unique contributions. You are unconventional and admire other noncon-
formists.
Green/Red Introverts
CHAPTER 8

Because you are a keen and penetrating observer, you have a good handle
on what’s going on in the cosmic drama around you. You enjoy helping
others, not out of guilt but a desire to assist. Life’s challenges find you opti-
mistic, adaptable, and ingenious. Routine saps your energy, but your adapt-
ability helps you do what you must.
Projecting the trends and pitfalls of the future is one of your greatest gifts.
A big-picture thinker, you take in everything, focusing on what impacts
people and has global ramifications.
You are a gleeful warrior against bureaucracy. It is imperative that you be
allowed creative freedom or you become a saboteur. While you are flexible
and accommodating to work with, you get fatigued and cranky working in
open office settings or when your privacy is not respected.
Others see you as insightful and an excellent listener. In relationships, you
establish rapport by being genuine and nonjudgmental. But the true intensity
of your feelings is revealed only to those who know you well.
The people who irritate you most are intrusive, controlling, and overly crit-
ical of others. In the second half of your life, as you move toward a more
objective and logical approach to others, you will handle these folks better.
Your superior verbal abilities extricate you from the web of their agendas. 
CASE STUDY ONE
Author and Editor
Dan Shaw is a talented author with a long, well-credentialed resume mostly
in the home design field. He has written and/or edited for the New York Times,
House and Garden, and O at Home, among many other publications. The
majority of the time he lived and worked in New York City.
Today, he calls a very small New England town home. “I went to an office
for twenty years,” says Dan. “I like not going to an office right now. The type
of life change I wanted was spiritually oriented.” Dan created that opportunity
for himself on a deeply forested piece of land by a river. Green/Red Introverts
enjoy working at home more than most.
He describes working at magazines as being “all about the social interac-
tions,” normally a stressor to Introverts. But Dan liked this part of his job. “It
was easy for me because it was part of the work structure, and I did not have
to initiate social interactions,” Dan says. 
He brought many Green gifts to his work. “I see things very well—the unfa-
miliar in the familiar,” he says. “I am confident in what I do, and I am a good

writer who’s done serious journalism. So I have very high standards.”
Green/Reds are perfectionists, an advantage in writers.
Typically for a Green, money and success are only two of many equal moti-
vators. When asked about them, Dan replied, “I wouldn’t mind having money,
but it doesn’t pull me.” He explained his choice to freelance, saying, “I
attained the number two position at a couple of magazines and realized I did
not have the ambition in me to be number one.”
Today, Dan is developing two coffee-table books, both of which he expects
to publish within a year or two. He’s in his home office five to ten hours a day
researching, writing, or arranging new, exciting projects such as the online
magazine Rural Intelligence, which he founded. This allowed him to meet new
people when he reported stories while maintaining his independence and
ability to work from home. “When I am writing, I get lost in it—not looking at
the clock,” he says. Working at home, sometimes he chooses to chop
firewood or make stew. “That’s the nice part of it,” this Introvert admits.
You on the Job
AS A LEADER 
“Dogged consensus builder” describes the Green/Red Introvert leadership
style. You work doggedly to achieve what is important to you, especially treat-
ing colleagues and staff well. Ethical, supportive, motivating, creatively encour-
aging, sensitive, and patient are words your people would use to describe you
at the helm. A keen observer of people, you understand what motivates
others, and you use that to draw the best out of them. 
You build consensus by encouraging openness, giving positive feedback,
being generous with time and resources, and being patient with process issues.
Personalizing your relationships with staff and colleagues ensures support.
You build extremely loyal teams by encouraging rather than commanding. 
AS A TEAM PLAYER
You have deep and accurate insights into your team members because you
hear what is really being said. Warmth and acceptance put them at ease.
Defining common goals is your gift to the team, drawing people together.
Matching people to appropriate tasks is another talent; you may find yourself
suggesting who should do what even if you’re not the leader.

Your forward thinking and provocative ideas frequently get the juices flow-
ing in others. The team often credits you with breaking them out of creative
logjams.
You may irritate teammates by becoming too attached to a value not shared
by the rest of the team.
Look at figure 8–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 8–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Like to explore new possibilities, solving problems in an original way
H Support the development of others
H Understand how underlying emotions impact productivity
H Get right to the guts of an issue
H Can concentrate and work for long periods alone
Now see how one Green/Red Introvert uses these strengths in a very differ-
ent field.
CASE STUDY TWO
Business Conference Planner
Anne Thayer is one of the 5 percent of Greens who work in the Wall Street
community. She has carved out a niche in relationship-building financial con-
ferences. Seemingly going against her artistic, Introverted nature, Anne
nonetheless enjoys the creative aspects of the planning process. She writes
the program, gets the speakers, and produces the program brochure. On con-
ference days, she brings her acting skills to the conference podium.
As an Introvert, Anne is challenged by the fifty-plus cold calls she makes
each day. Fortunately, she has a private office. When she needs a break, she
closes her door and does the Five Tibetan Rites of yoga for a quick recharge.
Afterward, she eats a simple bowl of bean soup, and she’s ready to rock and
roll. Her colleagues, who enjoy her warmth and empathy, discreetly hold her
calls.
C H A P T E R  8  |
G R E E N / R E D  I N T R O V E R T S
63

64
PA R T  2  |  G R E E N S
A theater major in college, Anne drifted into popular culture event planning
to support her studies. She found she was more skilled and better paid behind
the scenes than onstage, and a career in conference planning blossomed. 
Conference planning offers Anne the opportunity to use her relationship-
building and writing skills and get well paid for them. The financial concepts
she must master, though, can be onerous for her; Greens rarely choose finan-
cial careers.
Conference planning involves three very Green areas: relationship building,
writing, and showcasing the leading ideas of the field. Anne loves to see peo-
ple engaged in enthusiastic shop talk. She feels proud that her programs have
paved the way for multimillion-dollar deals.
She also enjoys writing the programs and event brochures. Many
Green/Red Introverts take up writing at some point, and Anne is fortunate
that’s part of her job. She enjoys being onstage emceeing her programs. 
Cold calls, constant networking, and after-hours socializing leave her
exhausted. If forced to work a weekend she would normally spend recharging,
she frequently runs down her immune system and catches a cold. When she
can get enough alone time, however, she enjoys her work. 
Ideal Work Environment
Green/Red Introverts do best when not bombarded by the demands of an
office; they make excellent telecommuters. You need reflective time and the
control of a home environment, like Dan Shaw has.
When a job offer is made, leverage as much as you can from the list in
figure 8–2.
FIGURE 8–2 The Ideal Green/Red Introvert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. If these
descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve tested your individual color
correctly. Other Colors, especially Golds, would find this environment
uncomfortable and unproductive. The optimal Green/Red Introvert work
environment:
H Is democratic and informal. You function best with a minimum of rules,
paperwork, and supervision. Rank and status are fluid. 

H Is supportive and harmonious, fostering cooperation and trust.
Backstabbing, confrontation, and malicious gossip irritate and distract
you from the task at hand. 
H Encourages creativity and idea generation. 
H Recognizes individual needs of staff and clients. Seek companies that
encourage work/life balance and high levels of customer service.
H Is in sync with personal values. Companies that violate your values will
soon see you gone. 
H Allows for private space. As an Introvert, your batteries get drained
when dealing with people, even if your people skills are superb. You
think, perform, and recharge best in a private space. Insist on one as a
condition of employment if possible.
A corporate culture integrating the above elements is fertile soil for your
career advancement.
The worst type of work culture for a Green/Red Introvert emphasizes rou-
tine and details. Highly political atmospheres and power struggles destroy the
creative freedom and trust necessary for Green/Reds to flourish. Tight dead-
lines impose pressure that is anything but motivating to them.
When Introverted Green/Reds work in nonideal corporate cultures, pro-
ductivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Introverted Green/Red’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Green/Reds get along
especially well with other Greens. But bosses of other Color types who
possess the characteristics in figure 8–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 8–3 The Green/Red Introvert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Is flexible
H Does not micromanage you
H Takes a personal interest in you and your development
H Protects you from professional intrigue and politics
C H A P T E R  8  |
G R E E N / R E D  I N T R O V E R T S

H Values innovation
H Has a high level of integrity
Careers That Attract Green/Red Introverts
Like Anne, you are most attracted to careers that provide recognition for your
creativity in writing and the visual and performing arts or your interest in help-
ing others grow and develop. Green/Red Introverts need to work with people
who have a personal interest in them and express appreciation. Working alone
or in small groups is best for their productivity, especially if they are focusing
on solutions that enhance the lives of others. The atmosphere ideally is casual
and informal, like Dan’s home office. Often Green/Red Introverts will change
careers many times before finding something in which they believe.
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals
to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color style characteristics that create suc-
cess in that broad area. 
According to our research, jobs italicized in the lists below are predicted to
benefit from an above-average growth rate over the next several years. This

CASE STUDY THREE
When a Career Isn’t Working
Financial trading desks are notorious for their frat-house culture. Those who
thrive enjoy the adrenaline rush of making instant multimillion-dollar decisions.
In the process they also scream, hurl obscenities at each other, and occasion-
ally throw food across the room. And for the most part, colleagues do not take
offense. Later they will all go out, share a few drinks, and wipe the slate clean.
Enter Phyllis Rosen. Riding the wave of the women’s rights movement, she
landed a plum job on the trading desk of a giant Wall Street brokerage firm
when the company came under pressure to bring women into management. 
“The trading desk was the center of everything,” Phyllis says. “Whatever
happened somewhere in the world had an immediate reaction on Wall Street.
I became an information junkie.” She also became an adrenaline junkie, her
Red side loving the fast pace and the exhilaration of making good trades.
The rushes came at the expense of her Green side. Few Greens enter Wall
Street, an arena that rewards risk taking and virtually ignores the emotional
component. Her male coworkers were her biggest source of stress. “In those
days, they treated each other crudely,” she says, “and went for blood when
they smelled a weakness.”
Not all trades go well, and Phyllis found it very stressful when she lost
money for her clients. After a while, the pressures became greater than the
adrenaline rushes, and Phyllis had to make some hard decisions about what
else to do. After twenty years on Wall Street, she became a career counselor
based in New York City. Although she still has some stress in having to replen-
ish clients constantly, she says, “I’m energized by this work because I feel I
make a difference, I’m good at it, and I satisfy my curiosity about people and
the choices they make.” 
Your Personality’s Challenges
Green/Red Introverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some listed below you have, others you don’t. Tone down a blind spot by
focusing on it, then choose more productive actions and make them habits.
(Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q Can be too idealistic and ignore bottom-line consequences. (Making
an ideal real can be prohibitively expensive. Consult Golds and Blues
about processes and costs.)

Q Don’t speak up enough and appear disengaged. (Few know how much
energy it takes to listen, and you listen intently. Your concentration,
however, comes across as aloofness. Just throw in a few comments to
let others know you’re present—humor counts.)
Q Don’t prioritize and appear disorganized. (You have only one priority
a day—sit down and prioritize that day’s activities. You can handle
that, right?)
Q Consider your own values superior. (Others may compromise or be
more realistic, but your ideals are ideal. Once you recognize the
strengths of other Colors, though, this tendency will mellow.)
Q May miss deadlines because you are a perfectionist. (Being perfect
means meeting the deadline. Your boss feels that way, so prioritize that
career-important deadline over less important details.)
Q Can be too reserved to be effective. (The more cautious you are about
speaking up, the more valuable your insight is likely to be. Give your-
self the opportunity for positive reinforcement.)
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Green/Red Introverts need to process information. With some interviewers,
particularly Greens and Reds, you will feel a comfortable rapport. But with
those of other Colors, you need a response strategy.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Get excited by new fields and unusual opportunities
Q Brainstorm creatively
Q Present yourself as adaptable, committed, easy to work with, and a
quick study
Q Create a master plan for your search with hard research and soul
searching
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Network a little more, even if it feels phony to you
Q Stick with your objectives; don’t change course on a whim
Q Role play compensation negotiations (find a willing Gold or Red to help)
C H A P T E R  8  |
G R E E N / R E D  I N T R O V E R T S
69

Q Talk more and sell your accomplishments
Q Hold back ideas on which you have not done cost research
The Green/Red Introvert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style, use the suggestions in parentheses.
In following your natural style, you:
Q Are quiet and calm. (This can look like disinterest—most interviewers
expect a certain amount of nervousness. Make sure to speak more than
you normally do, especially at first.)
Q Listen well. (This impresses many interviewers. But you may miss
opportunities to sell your accomplishments. Role play with a willing
Red.)
Q Share values and feelings with only a few people. (You may be able to
open up to a Green interviewer who puts you at ease. With others, pre-
pared statements about yourself will keep you looking confident.) 
Q Are global and metaphoric in speech. (With interviewers who look
skeptical or confused, read straight off your resume for a while.)
Q Present information and schedules as tentative and adaptable. (But
don’t be vague about when you can start a job—give an exact date.)
Q See the big picture and present that first. (Great if you’re interviewing
for a senior level position, irritating if for a junior slot. No boss wants
a subordinate who sees more on the horizon than he or she does. Share
only if asked; do not volunteer.)
Okay, go do something fun but nonfattening now. Later, read chapter 9,
“Reds Overall.” Chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to
Other Styles,” will help you identify different Colors and use their strengths
collaboratively; you just have to know where to look and how to ask. If you
are actively engaging in a job search, jot notes in the Roadmap in chapter 27.
Recording your strengths and strategies feels supportive and encouraging.

Reds are among the most adventurous and entertaining people in the uni-
verse. Perhaps the best-known Red in the United States is President Donald
Trump, who follows in the footsteps of other Reds such as George W. Bush,
Bill Clinton, Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Franklin
D. Roosevelt. The former real-estate deal maker, frequently referred to merely
as “the Donald,” starred in his own reality television show, The Apprentice,
which first appeared in 2004. (Donald has not taken the Color Q test, but his
personality style has been determined by the Myers-Briggs community.)
“Deals are my art form,” Trump said in his 1988 best-seller, Trump: The
Art of the Deal. “Other people paint beautiful pictures on canvas or write
wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals; that’s how I get
my kicks.”1 Kicks are a prime motivator for Reds, who will scan the universe
twenty-four hours a day to find the next exciting thing. “Money was never a
big motivation for me except as a way to keep score,” Trump added in his
book. “The real excitement is playing the game.”2 In his 2016 presidential
campaign Trump was frequently criticized for offering a platform low on
details. This is in keeping with his Red nature, as Reds typically prefer to
focus on crisis management and activities that generate immediate results.

Time magazine described then-presidential candidate Trump as a “gleeful
provocateur” and “breaking every rule in the book.”3 Through his compelling
energy as a speaker and unique charisma, “a party supposedly pledged to con-
servative values has elected a radical president who promises to tear up
treaties, overturn laws, jail his opponent, and sue his critics.”4
Donald graduated from Wharton Business School and quickly gravitated
to his father’s real-estate business. There he could get out in the field and
apply his natural Red problem-solving skills in a hands-on way. But his supe-
rior Red negotiation abilities won out, and his real estate deals soon defined
the trajectory of his career. Starting with a $1 million loan from his father,5
Donald today is self-described as a billionaire, although there exists no cer-
tain public measure of his true net worth. Reds, more than any other Color,
enjoy life’s sensual pleasure such as great food and fine wines. Trump’s
wealth affords him the finest of everything the world has to offer, thus
attracting the spotlight. Thrice-married, he spoke on video about his rela-
tionship with women.6 Controversial events like this tainted his presidential
bid. However, it’s possible this may have actually attracted some voters. “No
doubt there were many Trump voters who looked at the skyscrapers and jets
and helicopters with his name emblazoned on them and figured any man
who could do that could do anything.”7 Based solely on personality type, his
presidential administration likely will be characterized by sudden reversals
of policy, tough foreign policy negotiations, de-emphasis on long-term plan-
ning, and active crisis management. 
These Red traits are shared by Christine “Christie” Todd Whitman, man-
agement consultant and former governor of New Jersey. Christie was born
into a politically active family, so it was probably inevitable that she would
achieve political noteworthiness. But it helped immensely that she was a Red.
Those attributes catapulted her from an unknown county board member in
1982 to New Jersey governor a mere decade later.
Christie’s father, Webster B. Todd, was a contractor whose family firm built
Rockefeller Center in New York City and restored Williamsburg in Virginia.
At age 50, he retired and turned to his true passion, Republican politics. His
wife, Eleanor, joined him, attending every Republican national convention
from 1940 to 1976 in an official capacity. Christie had experiences of which
few children could boast: at age 6, presenting dolls to Richard Nixon’s wife,
Patricia, for their daughters, Julie and Tricia; and at age 9, attending her first
national convention and presenting Dwight Eisenhower with a leather pouch
she had made for his golf balls. 
74
PA R T  3  |  R E D S

In 1990, Christie made a move that lower-risk personality types would
have dismissed as sheer folly. She plunged into the limelight by running
against incumbent U.S. Senator Bill Bradley. Many in her own party did not
support her, figuring she was sure to lose to Bradley, an All-American Rhodes
scholar, a former star forward of the New York Knicks, and formidable
fundraiser. He spent $12 million, she spent $1 million. She lost, but only by
just under 3 percent. The gamble had worked; people took notice. “I knew it
was a long shot,” Christie says today, “but I saw an opportunity to gain
statewide exposure.” She did so, in typical Red calculated-risk-taking fashion.
Reds enjoy camaraderie. To position herself in three years’ time as a viable
gubernatorial candidate, Christie hosted a talk show, wrote a newsletter,
formed a political action committee, and spearheaded the Neighborhood
Leadership Initiative, designed to identify and train grass-roots leaders. But
what got her the most attention was an extended bus tour designed to meet
as many New Jersey citizens as possible. She beat her opponent, incumbent
Jim Florio, in 1993 by one percent of the vote.
Reds overflow with physical and mental energy, as well as competitiveness.
It was said during Christie’s tenure that the state troopers assigned to follow
her around and guard her ended up in better physical shape than they ever
were before.8 She set aside several days a week as road days, talking to people
around the state. Politics did not blunt her love of animals. Her position
allowed her to join park rangers in freezing midwinter weather to observe as
they placed ear tags on newly born bear cubs. Christie cuddled the cubs in
her jacket as rangers tranquilized the mothers.
Reds are bold and not afraid of controversy, an asset in the political arena. 
Their shirtsleeve management style is easygoing, down-to-earth, and expe-
dient. Reds are flexible and, spontaneous, and they have the ability to relate
to and persuade other people. Politics is high on the list of most satisfying
occupations for a Red personality. More than any other type, Reds love risk
and thrive in chaotic situations, moving in to bring order and focus. Christie,
like Reds in the corporate world, leads by keeping close to the grass-roots,
encouraging personal responsibility, seeking quick results, and focusing on
personal goals. She is informal, action oriented, and collaborative, viewing
emergencies as interesting challenges rather than intrusions.
Today, Christie Todd Whitman keeps herself visible by running the
Whitman Strategy Group, an environmentally oriented management con-
sulting and strategic planning firm with offices in New Jersey and
Washington, DC.

Christie Todd Whitman embodies the typical traits of the Red personal-
ity—a let’s-do-it-now, can-do, live-and-let-live super-realist who thrives from
daring and an ability to handle a crisis better than any other Color. 
Reds do not respond well to theories or abstract concepts, preferring
instead to focus on today’s reality. Their view of the world is what they can
see, touch, taste, smell, and hear for themselves. Reds need freedom and inde-
pendence and hate to feel trapped in either work or relationships. Guilt, obli-
gation, and duty rarely motivate them. They are loyal to friends and family,
but loathe being tied down to schedules and routines not of their own choos-
ing. The pursuit of action drives many Reds to try new experiences, adven-
tures, activities, or foods. They work in order to spend, rather than to save or
invest. The saying “He who dies having worn out the most toys wins” is
typical of the Red mentality.
Another famous Red in the political arena was Winston Churchill. J. Paul
Getty represented Reds in the corporate world. Michael Jordan illustrates the
Red style in sports, Amelia Earhart in adventuring, George Patton in the mil-
itary, and Justin Bieber, Leonardo DiCaprio, Scarlett Johansson, Nicole
Kidman, Ashton Kutcher, Jennifer Lawrence, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Katy
Perry, and Barbra Streisand in the field of entertainment.
This chapter will help you determine if you’ve tested your primary color
correctly. It also will help you identify Reds among people you know, as will
figure 24–1 in chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to
Other Styles.”
If the self assessment at the beginning of the book scored you as a Red,
congratulations. You are one of the most fun people in the known universe.
You will also be impatient about reading a book like this, preferring instead
to get on with things more real and less abstract. However, if you are inter-
ested in reading more about yourself, or you want to impress someone who
thinks this is a great book and you should read it, go to your specific Color’s
chapter. We know you’re going to skim it. Just be sure to read the section
about your most satisfying careers, or you’ll miss the most practical part.

Red/Blue Extroverts
YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Red, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Blue personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Extrovert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being with people rather than being
alone. It’s likely you have little patience for this book and are just reading it
to please someone. So we’ll keep this realistic, or we know you’re out of here.
You Overall
High energy, good humor, and optimism are hallmarks of Red/Blue Extroverts.
Unusually effective in times of crisis and change, you seek and revel in the
unexpected. Active and independent, you function best in small collegial
teams where hierarchy is secondary to getting the job done. Variety makes
you happy, as does operating outside the norms followed by others.
Realistic and pragmatic, you trust only what you have personally observed.
A particularly acute visual memory makes you exceptional at recalling details.
You want the facts but enjoy humorous anecdotes.
Your communication style is blunt and direct, which you find efficient.
Others, however, may be put off by your style, and this confuses you. Though
very attentive in the moment, you have a short attention span. 
You resist making decisions under pressure. You like to keep all options open
as long as possible. When ready, however, you decide with the speed of light.
CHAPTER 10

Unusually adept at sizing up problems, you move in quickly for solutions.
You trust your own instincts first, bureaucracy last, and often bypass rules
and procedures. While adept at handling immediate problems, you have a
hard time staying focused on long-term challenges. 
Others see you as a gifted negotiator who can make logical and difficult
decisions. Although you are tolerant of most folks, you get annoyed by bossy
people who insist on “doing things the right way,” or whose emotionalism
clouds the issue.
In the second half of life, Red/Blue Extroverts continue to seek new chal-
lenges but slow down and reflect more between activities.
CASE STUDY ONE
Chief Executive Officer, Investment 
Consulting Firm, and Author
Peter Tanous is not your typical CEO and has the sense of humor to prove it. He
likes to joke that “an economist is someone who didn’t have the personality to
become an accountant.” He can say things like that because his books,
Investment Gurus and Wealth Equation, have both been successful enough
to be Money Book Club main selections and receive wide critical acclaim.
He started his business, Lynx Investment Advisory, LLC, a Washington, DC-
based investment consulting firm, relatively late in life at age 54. The advan-
tage was he brought wisdom, experience, and contacts to the table, making
him able to cope with the old business school rule about starting a business:
“Double the expense and halve the revenue of your plan and see if you still
make it, because that’s what’s most likely to happen,” he says. “As someone
I know put it, I never met a business projection I didn’t like. That’s because
they all look good!”
He set about drumming up business but found the conventional wisdom of
making tons of business calls was not the most effective way. “I found you are
better off concentrating on the ones where you have a high chance of
success . . . that includes people you know or institutions to which you have
privileged access,” he says. “Anything else is an uphill battle.” Red/Blue
Extroverts are strong motivators of people, and this was critical to his
success. Today, Peter’s firm advises on over $1 billion of client assets.
“I understand markets,” he says. “I am a very good salesperson and highly
optimistic, which is essential.” His Red side enjoys the changeable nature of
the financial markets and the diverse needs of his clients, particularly his
78
PA R T  3  |  R E D S

international ones. “I like dealing with their investment needs based on the
political environment that they live and function in,” he says.
His biggest energizer? “I enjoy making clients happy. I enjoy getting new
clients by convincing them of the value of what we do for them.” The duties
he leaves to others include “most administrative, regulatory, and legal tasks.
Pure research, as well.”
Peter’s top three strengths are typical of his Red/Blue Color. He lists them
as enthusiasm, understanding what people really mean (as opposed to what
they say), and being “not brilliant, but wise.”
He serves on the investment committee of his alma mater, Georgetown
University, and on the board of its University Library. He also serves as a
trustee of Lebanese American University. Peter is on the corporate boards of
General Employment Enterprises, Inc., and Worldcare, Ltd. “I very much enjoy
serving in that capacity and helping management achieve the goals we set for
them,” he says. 
You on the Job
AS A LEADER
“Straightforward, fair, and decisive” describes you. Collegial and persuasive,
you back it up with a down-in-the-trenches management style. Breaking ten-
sion with humor keeps your staff productive.
You are realistic about problems and outcomes. To keep a negotiating
process moving, you’ll compromise. Projects move forward fast under your
take-charge style, while you focus on bottom-line results. 
AS A TEAM PLAYER
Having realistic expectations of people and challenges is how you operate.
You make things happen and are skilled at persuading others to participate.
While you appear fun loving, you are quietly adept at obtaining necessary
resources to get things accomplished.
Look at figure 10–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 10–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart

CASE STUDY TWO
Career Coach/Entrepreneur
Reds are James Bond, risk-taking types, but they come in many forms. Laura
Hill is not a spy, but there is plenty of risk taking, urgency, and crisis in her pro-
fessional life. She is the principal of Careers in Motion LLC, a career coaching
firm that helps people attain more rewarding careers through strategic career
planning, more effective job searches, and building their personal brands.
Her Red primary enjoys the resume-writing process. “Resumes are very
tangible; there is a finished product,” she says. Reds often have trouble in
mostly conceptual, service-oriented roles where finished, tangible products
are rare, but Laura finds this serves her need. 
Laura’s Blue secondary personality provides strategic balance and an out-
let for her analytical side. “I get clients to look at their longer-term career—
not just their next job—and strategize how they can achieve their goals.
“One of the most engaging parts of my job is helping clients negotiate their
job offers. This always involves a high sense of urgency; a crisis of sorts.”
Reds thrive on, and seek out, adrenaline rushes; Red/Blues particularly enjoy
salary negotiations and can be fearless when discussing compensation.
Like most Reds, the (Gold’s natural) ability to organize is anathema to
Laura. “One of my least desirable tasks is cleaning up my desk and organizing
my files!” she says. Although she lacks a Green’s ability to read people well
and deeply relate to their emotions, she enjoys interacting with a variety of
people and the continual learning opportunities that provides. 

Red collegiality counterbalances this. “I network well and can build
rapport easily with my clients. I also inject practical common sense into their
thought processes,” she says. As an Extrovert, she has always gravitated to
roles where people interaction is a key element of her day. Prior to establishing
Careers in Motion, Laura moved through a few people-intensive careers of
her own: sales, executive recruiter, bank operations/management, and out-
placement consultant. “I think one of my most noteworthy career attributes as
a Red is that about every seven years, I’ve made a major career shift,” she
says. “I can’t imagine being in one job for a long time. I’m highly entrepreneur-
ial, a risk taker.” She recently became an angel investor in startup tech com-
panies, a risky proposition that’s not for everyone. “I enjoy analyzing the
companies and supporting dynamic entrepreneurs while hoping that one of
my investments will be a big winner.”
But her chief Red/Blue Extrovert strengths really shine in her current role.
“One of my best successes has been building a business and personal brand
as a career coach,” she says. “My reward is making a difference in the
careers of my clients.”
Ideal Work Environment
Freedom and fun define your ideal work space. Get as much of what follows
in figure 10–2 as possible.
FIGURE 10–2 The Ideal Red/Blue Extrovert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. If these
descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve tested your individual color
correctly. Other Colors, especially Golds, would find this environment uncom-
fortable and unproductive. The optimal Red/Blue Extrovert work environment:
H Is relaxed, tolerant, and informal. You function best with a minimum of
rules, paperwork, and supervision. You need freedom to move around. 
H Provides variety, excitement, and preferably a crisis or two. Repetitive,
expectable work brings out the worst in you. You’ll butt heads with
bureaucracy.
H Rewards entrepreneurial risk taking and a direct approach. You are val-
ued for your ability to handle the unexpected. If you can work in multiple
locations, you are happy and stimulated.
C H A P T E R  1 0  |
R E D / B L U E  E X T R O V E R T S
81

82
PA R T  3  |  R E D S
H Focuses on short-term problems. You need results now to feel good
about what you’re doing; you dislike being forced to think or operate long
term.
H Permits working on tangible products with factual information. If you
can’t see it, touch it, taste it, hear it, smell it, or prove it, you are not inter-
ested. Brainstorming is frustrating, except for the camaraderie.
H Has associates who are high energy and fun, and value practical expe-
rience. You are an enterprising individual who doesn’t want to be held
back.
H Provides public recognition. Recognition fuels you to greater achieve-
ment.
A corporate culture integrating the above elements is fertile soil for your
career advancement.
The worst type of work culture for a Red/Blue Extrovert is one that empha-
sizes long-term projects. The daily tone is overly serious; humor and play are
frowned upon. You will find it nearly impossible to accomplish anything in
hierarchical environments full of meetings and memos.
When Extroverted Red/Blues work in nonideal corporate cultures, produc-
tivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Extroverted Red/Blue’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Red/Blues get along especially
well with other Reds. But bosses of other Color types who possess the traits
in figure 10–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 10–3 The Red/Blue Extrovert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Is action-oriented, outgoing, and focused on end results rather than
schedules and timetables
H Gives you the goal, and then leaves you alone
H Creates rapport through a sense of humor
H Encourages fun in the workplace and postwork activities

Careers That Attract Red/Blue Extroverts
Like Peter Tanous and Laura Hill, you are most attracted to careers that pro-
vide freedom, action, and the ability to be a troubleshooter. 
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals
to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color style characteristics that create suc-
cess in that broad area. 
According to our research, jobs italicized in the lists below are predicted to
benefit from an above-average growth rate over the next several years. This
information is based on the continuously revised data provided by the U.S.

CASE STUDY THREE
When a Career Isn’t Working
Rick Jackson was the first child in his family to attend college. His family had
high hopes that he would become a doctor, but the theoretical nature of his
science classes simply didn’t appeal to him. Nor did being stuck in a lab all
day; Rick loved all sports and counted the minutes each day until he could
get outside.
Rick compromised and became one of the first African Americans in bio-
medical engineering. He loved the concrete, practical nature of the field,
working on real-world problems, often with immediate solutions. He still hated
the theory part of his studies but graduated near the top of his class.
He was recruited in his senior year to a well-known, fast-growing firm in
California. He relished the idea of adding several new sports to his repertoire. 
In his first year, he found himself constantly fatigued. Long hours allowed
for fewer sports to manage stress. He made his mark for handling crises well,
but he had to do constant theoretical research and talk theory with other
researchers. It drained him dry.
He was about to float a resume when a job opening for a biomedical com-
munity outreach person appeared on the cafeteria bulletin board. It featured
lots of variety, outdoor events, people contact, and no research. Rick went
straight to human resources and got the job. Today, Rick not only explains his
company’s products but brings back ideas he then designs for new ones as
well. Some of these have become major profit centers for the firm.

Your Personality’s Challenges
Red/Blue Extroverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
We emphasize potential because no Red has all of them. Tone down a blind
spot by deciding to see it, then choose more productive actions. (Suggestions
for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q Tend to be casual about rules, procedures, and authority. (This is
your number one career-derailing attribute. What makes your job
easier may make someone else’s much harder, and humor rarely
solves that. Think about your salary-review time when tempted to
skip a mundane procedure.)
Q Sometimes do not follow through on commitments. (If a commitment
bogs you down, you may skip it. In the professional world, however,
instead of appearing focused on important things, you actually look
like you don’t have your act together at times. Write appointments
down; review them each morning; call to cancel well ahead of time.)
Q Hate having tight deadlines, repetitive work, and having to work alone.
(Avoid or change jobs where these are the norm. This makes you pes-
simistic and joyless. If unavoidable, approach your tasks as if they were
all ridiculous; this will lighten your mood. So will setting yourself up
in a conference room near others.)
Q Don’t think much beyond today. (You are present centered; often an
advantage, but sometimes not. Set long-term goals as a mental disci-
pline.)
Q Often do not prepare for a meeting or project. (The ability to wing it is
vital in some circumstances. But being ill prepared for meetings and
projects damages credibility. Schedule at least twenty minutes for prep
beforehand.)
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
You’d rather be out there taking action than reading this. But here are some
quick, practical points to keep in mind.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Have an extensive network for job information and referrals and be
adept at using it
86
PA R T  3  |  R E D S

C H A P T E R  1 0  |
R E D / B L U E  E X T R O V E R T S
87
Q Get facts on different careers/companies
Q Sell yourself well, impressing interviewers with energy and respon-
siveness
Q Be specific and detailed about past work and achievements
Q Respond to unforeseen opportunities without trepidation
Q Logically weigh pros and cons of job offers
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Force yourself to set long-term career objectives; enlist the help of
friends or family, particularly Greens or Blues (to identify, read chapter
24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other Styles”)
Q Talk less, listen, and ask questions more
Q Be patient with multiple interviews and slow decision making
Q Follow through consistently with the details of a job search, such as
phone calls, thank-you notes, company research; get a willing Gold to
help you if possible
Q Talk over and decide what’s good for you and your family
The Red/Blue Extrovert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style, use the suggestions in parentheses. Mercilessly exploit your
natural traits and you’ll get more job offers. 
In following your natural style:
Q You speak with energy, excitement, charm, and humor. (You may be so
energetic that you intimidate some interviewers. If yours seems to get
defensive, sit back and answer the next few questions seriously to see
if that puts him or her at ease.)
Q You often give personal stories to make a point. (Watch to see if this
is well received. If the interviewer gets antsy or breaks eye contact, cut
it short.)

Q You focus on the current situation and not on future or strategic issues.
(Your ability to focus on the present is a valuable asset, but you may
be too short when handling future-oriented questions. Answer slowly
and thoughtfully. Then emphasize your talent for turning on a dime if
things change.)
Q You get to the point; you prefer to act rather than talk. (Ask for the job
at the end of the interview, but don’t rush things. Impatience will hurt
you here. If your interviewer seems indecisive, take action. Offer to
work a trial project or trial period.)
Q You reply quickly and think on your feet. (Normally a plus; but some
interviewers may want more thoughtful replies. Periodically sit back,
look up at the ceiling, and pause a moment before speaking further.)
Q You convince others with a sense of urgency and excitement. (Don’t let
your interviewer mistake your excited urgency for desperation. Try not
to sit farther forward in your chair than the interviewer is sitting.)
Q You make frequent jokes. (Gauge interviewer receptivity; stick with
neutral subjects.) 
Okay, go do something active and energizing. Later, check out chapter 14,
“Blues Overall,” if we’ve actually hooked you a little on this stuff. You can jot
notes if you want to impress someone with your attention and interest in the
Roadmap in chapter 27. The Roadmap is also a great tool to aid a job search.

Red/Blue Introverts
YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Red, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Blue personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Introvert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being alone rather than being with oth-
ers. It’s likely you have little patience for this book and are just reading this
to please someone. Unless we appeal to you logically and realistically, we
know you’ll dismiss all this material.
You Overall
Reflective, down to earth, and expedient, Red/Blue Introverts are convinced
only by logical reasoning. Self-starting is as natural to you as breathing.
Sharing your thoughts only happens if someone asks. Often absorbed in
your own world, you prefer working independently without interruption.
Being part of a small, collegial team where hierarchy is secondary to getting
the job done brings out your best.
You are unusually effective in times of crisis and change. Realistic and prag-
matic, you trust only what you have personally observed. With your particularly
acute visual memory, you excel at observing details. Oriented to the concrete,
here-and-now world, you have no use for long-term projects or abstract visions.
Your communication style is succinct and informal. You may appear
detached to others. Networking and socializing are low on your list of enjoyable
CHAPTER 11

activities. Others enjoy your deadpan humor but otherwise find you hard to
read. Unorthodox approaches to problems intrigue you, which, coupled with
the low visibility you prefer, may leave coworkers puzzled.
It’s likely you couldn’t care less; you view the process of getting involved
with others as a waste of time (although this characteristic mellows somewhat
in the second half of your life). Other Colors are intimidated by how quickly
you lose interest and stop listening when topics don’t appeal to you. You just
want the facts and respond best to practical solutions. 
Though very attentive in the moment, you have a short attention span. You
resist making decisions under pressure. You quickly size up problems but like
to keep all options open as long as possible, and this makes you a formidable
negotiator. When ready, however, you decide with the speed of light.
You are most irritated by emotional and pompous people who moralize or
get caught up in a single way of doing something. Living on the edge, seeking
action and variety appeal to you.
In business, you tend to avoid opportunities leading to management posi-
tions in large organizations. You’ll opt to sell or purchase a franchise while
turning your attention to ever-new interests. For you, rising to a position of
high responsibility is most likely under crisis conditions; here your flexibility
and ability to see the core of a problem make you a most effective leader.
If we’ve been fairly accurate so far (and we should be since this system has
been tested on millions of people worldwide for seven decades), give us a
little more time. Read the rest of this chapter to see if it might change your
life for the better.
CASE STUDY ONE
High-End Interior Designer
Bunny Williams’s interior designs are in high demand by high-net-worth
clients. “I do primarily residential work,” she says. “My interior design style is
quite varied, but it is really to create comfortable houses for people to live in.”
Working out of her Upper East Side Manhattan offices, Bunny manages
clients and her furniture-licensing business, Bunny Williams Home. Her
designs are featured at Ballard’s (tabletop and glassware), Dash & Albert
(rugs), and Lee Josa (fabrics). She has published five books.1 An Affair with
a House reveals the aesthetics of her warm and tasteful style. Bunny’s per-
sonality shines in this field, where a Red’s appreciation of life’s finer things
supports success.

“I immediately knew this is the field I wanted to be in. I came to New York
and got a job with a very prestigious antique firm, Stair and Company. Next I
went to work for the one interior design firm that I most wanted to work for,
Parish Hadley. I started out as Mr. Hadley’s secretary and worked my way up
to becoming a senior designer. After twenty years, I left and started my own
design company, Bunny Williams, Inc.”
Bunny’s Blue secondary personality provides the analytical and strategic
strengths necessary to her role as president of Bunny Williams, Inc. “I’m the
senior designer,” she says. “The most engaging part for me is the design ele-
ment. I also manage the business. The business part interests me; every
month I go through how we’re doing financially, I’m very aware of it. But that
isn’t what I want to spend all my time doing. I have people in the accounting
department who are better at accounting than I would be. I think any good
leader figures out their own role.”
Her Introvert side supports her work. “I sometimes just shut my office door,
get off the computer and phone, and look at my books, new magazines, and
catalogs. I get stimulated by new materials.”
Although her career path has been strategically focused, Bunny dealt with
the challenges of her early years in a Red’s present-centered way. “You don’t
know what a career is at fifteen or eighteen. I pursued something I liked.
Around thirty, I realized I was going to make a career out of it. You make a
huge commitment to a career. I think a lot of people stay in a position early on
because they need to pay the rent. They lose a lot of time trying to find their
passion. The earlier you say to yourself, ‘I don’t want to do this,’ the better it
is to move on and try something else.”
You on the Job
AS A LEADER
You lead your staff through action, by example. When assessing problems, you
are logical and realistic about the easiest way to complete the task. Your com-
munication style is precise, and you engage the skills of your staff efficiently. 
When others need information, you are a factual warehouse. Those facts
produce creative solutions and allow you to take well-calculated risks.
AS A TEAM PLAYER
You find working on a team draining and inefficient. Teammates get confused
and threatened when you go off and return with your own solutions and ideas.

Your natural reserve is counterbalanced by your love of action. If your team
is charged with handling a crisis, you may wind up being its leader, because
moving others to action is a natural skill.
Brief meetings are the only ones you tolerate. You may irritate others by not
completing tasks you have deemed low priority. They may mistake your
detachment for disorganization. 
Look at figure 11–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 11–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Bring people and tasks together in a way that inspires action
H Are highly observant
H Pay attention to factual information
H Excel in assignments that are action oriented, practical, and nonrepeti-
tious
H Value and promote efficiency
H Love to overcome obstacles using a logical approach
H Combine a no-nonsense need for facts and figures with an openness to
new strategies
H Can be productive for hours when left on your own
Here are some Red/Blue Introverts in action in very different fields.
CASE STUDY TWO
Deputy Chief, Educational Support Team
Alex Lee is a Red with an eye for opportunity. But rather than purely seeking
profit, Alex looks for ways to help higher education faculty teach more
effectively.
Reds are the most playful of the personality types, always ready for sports
and other games. The games Alex and his team of five program designers cre-
ate support and improve the higher education process.

“We create scenarios and teach students and faculty to run real-world
simulation games,” says Alex. “We research existing games for potential use
and sometimes create them to meet teachers’ desires. I have coauthored two
courses on teaching with games and coteach two other courses.”
It’s a great job for a Red, because it addresses hands-on needs that are
constantly evolving. “The best part of my job,” says Alex, “is that I get to do a
variety of things I like to do: teach, provide tech support, design games. I get
to go around and make people satisfied. It’s a series of different challenges—
never the same day in and day out.”
Not all the games Alex works on are usable or accepted; this developmen-
tal part of his job involves some risk taking. But the Red/Blue’s combination of
risk taking and strategic thinking is ideally suited to tackling such demands.
“I make many major shifts in direction,” says Alex. “I scan for opportunities,
then try them to see whether they’ll pan out. I tell myself I will never forgive
myself if I don’t try.” Exploring uncharted territory invigorates Reds, while it
can mentally exhaust other Colors (especially Golds).
Alex is more interested in being effective than always being right. “Our
greatest success, surprisingly, is that not every teacher uses what we provide
but that they know that we support them. They see we are not going to come
into their classrooms and shove something down their throats. Forcing our-
selves in would make us ineffective.”
Red/Blues are particularly effective at circumventing rules and procedures
they deem obstructive or unnecessary. Alex does so by assigning tasks to
others who he feels do them better. “One of my team writes better official
memos, and I have a team member who is better at day-to-day technical sup-
port,” he says. 
He has a uniquely Red way of dealing with tough clients. “One of the tech-
niques I use is to officially agree with them and then say something they did
not actually say. Then it sounds like their idea. If they contradict me, I can say,
‘I am sorry—I misunderstood you.’”
But Alex has a strong work ethic. “I bring a questioning attitude to my own
performance; I would not be effective if I thought I had all the answers.”
Ideal Work Environment
Your ideal work environment offers routine crises and a private office to
reflect in. Use all the leverage you can when a job offer is made to get as much
of what follows in figure 11–2 as possible.
C H A P T E R  1 1  |
R E D / B L U E  I N T R O V E R T S

FIGURE 11–2 The Ideal Red/Blue Introvert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. If these
descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve tested your individual color
correctly. Other Colors, especially Golds, would find this environment uncom-
fortable and unproductive. The optimal Red/Blue Introvert work environment:
H Is easygoing. You function best with a minimum of rules, paperwork, and
supervision. 
H Focuses on immediate results. You need results now to feel good about
what you’re doing.
H Permits working on real things and tangible products. If you can’t see it,
touch it, taste it, hear it, or smell it, you are not interested. Brainstorming
is a frustrating waste of time for you.
H Encourages a blunt, direct approach. Small talk and beating around the
bush make you impatient. Subtlety, nuance, and emotion are for other
Colors, not you.
H Offers opportunities to experiment. 
H Contains variety, excitement, and openness to high-stakes gambles. A
crisis or two to share with action-oriented associates is your definition
of a perfect day.
H Allows for autonomy and private space. As an Introvert, your batteries
get drained when dealing with others, even if your people skills are
superb. If you have to share your work space, you will feel a lot more
fatigue at the end of the day. You think and perform better in a private
space; insist on one as a condition of employment if possible.
A corporate culture integrating the above elements is fertile soil for your
career advancement.
The worst type of work culture for an Introverted Red/Blue is a strongly
hierarchical one that runs on meetings and memos. It requires too much col-
laboration with others, especially if those others need constant reassurance. 
When Introverted Red/Blues work in nonideal corporate cultures, produc-
tivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.

The Introverted Red/Blue’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a great boss is pretty hard to leave. Red/Blues get along especially well
with other Reds. But bosses of other Color types who possess the traits in fig-
ure 11–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 11–3 The Red/Blue Introvert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Points you in the right direction and then leaves you alone 
H Shares your sense of humor
H Rewards logic and is not threatened by your independent ways
H Is willing to take risks
Careers That Attract Red/Blue Introverts
Like Alex Lee, you are most attracted to careers that provide freedom, action,
and variety. You’ll often gravitate to positions where your negotiation skills
are appreciated. Look for jobs that reward your key strengths: jumping in, act-
ing immediately, and negotiating whatever it takes to get the job done.
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals
to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color style characteristics that create suc-
cess in that broad area. 
According to our research, jobs italicized in the lists below are predicted to
benefit from an above-average growth rate over the next several years. This
information is based on the continuously revised data provided by the U.S.
Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics on their websites O*NET
OnLine (www.onetonline.org) and http://www.bls.gov/CAREEROUTLOOK/.
There you will find in-depth information about job requirements and salary
ranges.
There are successful people of all Color styles in all occupations. In non-
ideal jobs, you can still shine by creating your own niche.

CASE STUDY THREE
When a Career Isn’t Working
Hector Torres always knew he would one day manage his family’s upscale
Spanish restaurant. He really enjoyed working there as a teenager, sampling
the fine foods on the menu. Reds appreciate good food and fine wine more
than most other Colors. Hector enjoyed the pressure and crises, and his social
life came to him—an excellent situation for an Introvert who is drained by
C H A P T E R  1 1  |
R E D / B L U E  I N T R O V E R T S
97

parties. “Any job where I can move around as much as I do here—that’s for
me,” he always said.
Hector attended the Culinary Institute of America after high school, paying
particular attention to restaurant management. He was surprised to find some
of it quite boring— inventory control and nightly account balancing in partic-
ular. But Hector’s mind was set, and upon graduating, his parents retired and
he took over the restaurant, eager to implement some new ideas.
He found he had less skill at dealing with employee schedules and tem-
peraments than his parents, causing Hector constant irritation. Several long-
time waiters quit, and the small crises Hector enjoyed became big ones he did
not. Inventory and account balancing became daily realities. His relationship
with his fiancée became strained when he asked to postpone the wedding
until he got the restaurant under control.
It all came to a head the day the restaurant was robbed. The police came,
but all they could determine was that it was an inside job. Impatient with their
progress, Hector undertook his own internal investigation. Within forty-eight
hours he’d identified the culprit and gotten a fair amount of money back.
Hector hadn’t been this energized since he took over the restaurant. 
He went back to school and became a private detective. Today, he is mar-
ried and has his own investigative agency, specializing in restaurant inci-
dents. One of his siblings took over the restaurant, the old waiters returned,
and it is thriving.
Your Personality’s Challenges
Red/Blue Introverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
We emphasize potential because no Red/Blue has them all. Tone down a blind
spot by deciding to see it, then choose more productive actions. (Suggestions
for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q Tend to be casual with rules and procedures valued by others,
including meeting deadlines. (This is your number one career-derailing
attribute. What makes your job easier may make someone else’s much
harder, and deadpan humor rarely solves that. Think about salary
review time when tempted to push a deadline.) 
Q Sometimes step on the feelings of associates. (Getting involved with
people is not a priority for you; being expedient is. Hurt feelings
hinder results.) 
98
PA R T  3  |  R E D S

Q Hate not having control of your own schedule and being under tight
deadlines. (This makes you cynical and frivolous. Give serious consid-
eration to leaving any job in which these are a frequent occurrence.)
Q May wing things that require preparation. (This undermines your
credibility. People will dismiss your special qualities and contributions
if they are inconvenienced by your loose approach to areas that are
important to them.)
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
You’d rather be out there hitting the pavement than reading this. But hang in
there; you’re almost done. You’ll benefit from these concrete job-search tips:
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Respond quickly and decisively to unforeseen opportunities
Q Be specific and precise in your interview about past positions and
achievements
Q Make good career contacts through your love of adventurous hobbies
Q Negotiate the terms of a new job well
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Force yourself to set long-term goals; enlist the help of friends or
family, particularly Golds or Blues (to identify, read chapter 24, “Before
I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other Styles”)
Q Prepare ahead for emotional, rapport-building questions; practice role
playing with a Green
Q Follow through on commitments, deadlines, and the nitty-gritty tasks
of a job search such as keeping lists of contacts and sending thank-you
notes; enlist the aid of a willing Gold to help
Q Discipline yourself to think about how a job offer will affect you and
your family in the future, not just this month or this year
Q Be aggressive about soliciting referrals and leads from acquaintances
and strangers, as your preferred circle of friends is small

The Red/Blue Introvert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style, use the suggestions in parentheses. Mercilessly exploit your
natural traits and you’ll get more job offers. 
In following your natural style you:
Q Are concrete and realistic about past responsibilities and accomplish-
ments. (Some interviewers will dig for feelings: “Did you like your pre-
vious boss? How did you get along with your coworkers?” Ask a Green
to help role play such questions ahead of time.)
Q Avoid sharing personal information. (Keeping your distance will make
you look as if you have something to hide. Take a moment if needed,
then be honest.)
Q Answer questions succinctly and informally. (Some interviewers look
for more formal responses. If there’s a pause and the interviewer seems
to be waiting for something more, use your quick thinking to expand
your answer with more facts.) 
Q Listen only when your interest is engaged. (Grit your teeth and listen
to everything your interviewer says, no matter how irrelevant. Patience
is a virtue in a job interview.)
Q Use deadpan humor. (This works with people who know you well, but
for those who don’t know you, it can create social awkwardness. If a
joke falls flat in an interview, quickly smile and say, “Just kidding.”) 
Q Focus on the company’s current situation and not on future or
strategic issues. (Your ability to focus on the present is a valuable asset,
but you may be too short when handling future-oriented questions.
Answer slowly and thoughtfully. Then emphasize your talent for turn-
ing on a dime if things change.)
Congratulations for making it all the way through this chapter. Most Reds
won’t. Reward yourself by doing something active now. Later, check out chap-
ter 14, “Blues Overall,” if we’ve actually hooked you a little on this stuff. You
can jot notes if you want to impress someone with your attention and interest
in the Roadmap in chapter 27. This is also a good place to record the infor-
mation you pick up when networking during a job search.

Red/Green Extroverts
YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Red, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Green personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Extrovert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being with people rather than being
alone. It’s likely you have little patience for this book and are just reading this
to please someone. So we’ll make this realistic and fun, or we know you’re out
of here.
You Overall
Warm and energetic, Red/Green Extroverts have wide interests and many
friends. You are active, sociable, and adaptable. In entrepreneurial startups or
corporate crises, you shine.
Realistic and pragmatic, you trust only what you have personally observed.
With a particularly acute visual memory, you excel at observing details. Yet
you are easygoing and fun loving, and you enjoy the unexpected. 
Of all the Colors, you are most in touch with the present moment.
Because you are driven to achieve results now, you have low tolerance for
procedure and routine. Bossy people who insist on having things done “the
right way” annoy you mightily. Otherwise, you have an accepting, live-and-
let-live attitude. 
CHAPTER 12

Others see you as exuberant, entertaining, and generous; they feel positive
and enthused when you are around. Networking comes naturally to you. 
Straightforward communication is your style. You want the facts but enjoy
an anecdote or two (particularly a humorous one). Though very attentive in
the moment, you have a short attention span. Making decisions under pres-
sure is not for you; instead, you keep all options open as long as possible.
When ready, however, you decide with the speed of light.
CASE STUDY ONE
Entrepreneur, Restaurant and Mail Order Businesses
Gregory B. Bidou didn’t think racing motorcycles as a teenager would ever
lead to a career. So he went to college and became an environmental engineer
and industrial hygienist. But for thirty years this Red/Green Extrovert was dis-
satisfied because, “Even if I did my job perfectly—in terms of lives saved and
illnesses prevented—it wouldn’t be recognized statistically for decades.” 
So in his spare time, Greg sold parts for vintage British motorcycles. He
enjoyed the immediate rewards of refurbishing rusty parts and diagnosing
mechanical problems with customers.
Within two years, this side business outgrew his garage. Greg had to rent
expensive warehouse space, some not secure from theft, for his rapidly grow-
ing inventory. 
Greg enjoyed meeting these concrete challenges. One Sunday, deep in the
countryside, he found a vacant, neglected coffee shop with an apartment
above and two barns on the property. By Monday evening, he had purchased
it, not even sure what he was going to do with the storefront but encouraged
by the positive response of town hall authorities.
He sold his house for a good price, allowing him to pay cash for his new
property and have funds left over to renovate. Members of his new community
kept asking him, “Are you going to reopen the coffee shop?” Despite having
no restaurant experience, he jumped in. It took a year for him to rebuild the lit-
tle café essentially by himself. 
His business plan became to sell motorcycle parts one-half of the week
and operate a biker-friendly café the other half, both businesses helping to
build each other.
His previous industrial hygiene career allowed him to deal with stimulat-
ing crisis situations. But, Greg says, “What drove me nuts was babysitting

103
programs once I had implemented them.” Red/Green Extroverts like startups
but find ongoing administration repetitive and stifling.
Present-centered Red/Green Extroverts need immediate results. “In the
café, I make a dish. Right away, customers can tell me if they like it.” However,
Greg does get frustrated by making the same dishes time and again.
The motorcycle-parts business offers constant change and challenge. “No
two customers are alike, and no two bikes are alike,” Greg says with satisfac-
tion. “I really like diagnosing motorcycle problems over the phone and provid-
ing the parts to solve them.”
He even likes coping with the heart-stopping cash flow problems new
business owners can face. “I see it all as risk management. I’ve had to sacri-
fice compared to my old corporate income days, but so far no creditors have
come knocking on my door.”
Today, Greg’s café has been very successful—enough for mention in the
New York Times and Men’s Journal magazine, and many glowing reviews,
most notably by Jane Stern of Roadfood fame. His motorcycle-parts business
picks up the slack in the winter when café traffic declines, and he lives a mod-
est but much happier life.
You on the Job
AS A LEADER
Quick—that’s you. You have a fast, down-in-the-trenches management
style, breaking pressured moments with humor. You prefer collegiality over
power plays. 
Risk and change do not worry you, because you are realistic about
problems and outcomes. Creative solutions that lack a track record intrigue,
rather than frighten, you.
AS A TEAM PLAYER
Realistic and grounded, you make things happen—your enthusiasm inspires
everyone to participate. Your image is fun loving, although you are adept at
finding the necessary resources to get things accomplished.
You may irritate others by placing too much focus on fun or the adrenaline
rush.
Look at figure 12–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.

Now see how two other Red/Green Extroverts use their strengths in very
different fields.
CASE STUDY TWO
General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer,
Alternative Financial Investments
When things are new, trending, or in need of upgrading, Ria Davis, Esq., is the
one to assign. These are the strengths she brought to her role as general
counsel and chief compliance officer at Semper Capital Management, LP, a
$1 billion New York City alternative investment firm for institutional and retail
clients.
Normally, you don’t find Reds like Ria doing detailed financial compliance
work. “I’m a Red in a Gold job,” she admits wryly. But how she got there was
completely a Red story.
“Massive changes were happening in Semper’s business in 2013,” she
says. “I spent eighteen months rebuilding an effective compliance program to
reflect those changes, reconfiguring a lot of technology solutions. (I’m very
intuitive about how things should work mechanically and technologically.) All
the compliance manuals were rewritten, and we did an end-to-end audit of
the compliance function.”
But the Red personality’s strengths lie in problem solving rather than main-
taining a well-designed department. “My career choices have been all about
the need for variety and change, to constantly be learning new things,” she

says. “I never had ‘a plan’ other than to avoid getting ‘stuck’ in a boring role.”
Reds prefer immediate challenges. 
“I learned to speak Portuguese in a few weeks when my firm decided that
Brazil was a ‘hot market.’ At my first client meeting, we discussed accounting
matters. I had to figure out what a Japanese man was saying in heavily
accented Brazilian Portuguese. Piece of cake!” she recalls. “My motto is:
‘Been there, done that; what’s next?’ Once a challenge has been met, I am
ready to move on to something else.” 
Reds are talented problem solvers who plunge in even when the odds are
not good. They seem to make things happen with little effort that other Colors
find require meticulous planning. She was an early adopter of digital tools. “I
learned about the Internet and led a legal and technology team to build the
first secure private bank client website at Citigroup in the late 1990s,” she
says. “None of the other lawyers wanted to do it.”
Her career path has taken her from her start as an associate attorney at
Houston law firm Baker and Botts to several firms in New York (Shearman &
Sterling, Kaye Scholer, Brown & Wood [now Sidley-Austin], and Citigroup
Private Bank) before joining Semper. 
Ria speaks Spanish, French, and Portuguese; she would love to learn
Japanese. When speaking English, she is direct and pulls no punches—
typical of her Red personality type. “I’m a woman with a very direct,
masculine communication style, which creates a lot of challenges for me in
dealing with both men and women.” Fortunately, her Red collegiality provides
balance. Recently Ria changed careers. She is now the new Executive
Director of the Financial Women’s Association of NY.
CASE STUDY THREE
TV/Film Actor and Producer 
Howard Platt’s prolific show business career spans fifty years and has made
him a recognizable face and voice in many American households. Howard is
perhaps best known for his role as Hoppy the white cop on the classic sitcom
Sanford and Son, but his work extends through radio, television, film, theater
(acting and producing), and music. He has costarred with such well-known
actors as Alan Alda, Gene Hackman, Hal Linden, Lee Marvin, Bob Newhart,
Oliver Reed, Sissy Spacek, Connie Selleca, and John Travolta.

106
PA R T  3  |  R E D S
Howard currently stars in the long-running play A Couple of Blaguards, the
story of Angela’s Ashes author Frank McCourt and his brother Malachy. This
often takes Howard on the road to destinations across America. Typical of
adventurous and gregarious Reds, Howard enjoys the constantly new experi-
ences and people he meets on road trips. His Red visual memory and observa-
tional skills serve him well when navigating unfamiliar back roads and big cities.
“I spend a lot of time in Chicago,” he says. That’s where he produced the
theatrical hits Pump Boys and Dinettes, Driving Miss Daisy, Shirley Valentine,
and I’m Not Rappaport. That’s also where he worked with such luminaries as
Shelly Berman, Ellen Burstyn, Garrett Morris, and Loretta Swit. “I have family
I like to visit in Wisconsin and Dallas. I often go to New York and Los Angeles
for auditions. But these days I live in Mexico.”
Reds in general enjoy humor-filled conversations; Howard is an accom-
plished raconteur. His life stories are filled with celebrities and theatrical
adventures. His Red crisis-management abilities always serve him well when
he or a fellow actor forgets their lines; he can gauge and raise audience mood
immediately using his Green secondary type’s sensitivity to others. These traits
together make him easily able to improvise onstage as the need arises.
His Green side has inspired him to create through multiple artistic outlets.
He has composed ten songs; currently he is collaborating on (and will star in)
a play about the famous Midwestern environmental activist known only as the
Fox. Howard’s original music will be included in the score. 
Red/Greens thrive in flexible work environments. “I had the most fun work-
ing on Flying High,” Howard recalled of his starring role in the 1978–79 televi-
sion series. “The producers told the directors, ‘Don’t mess with Howard, let
him do what he does.’ So it was great! I had freedom to do what I wanted. I
would put the other actors on notice: ‘I’m going to do something, so just be
ready for it.’”
Ideal Work Environment
Greg Bidou’s motorcycle business and café both permit working on tangible
products that focus on short-term problems—perfect for a Red/Green
Extrovert. Red/Green Extroverts also like to operate by their own rules and
need very flexible environments, like Howard Platt.

seem obvious, that confirms you’ve tested your individual Color correctly.
Other Colors, especially Golds, would find this environment uncomfortable
and unproductive. The optimal Red/Green Extrovert work environment:
H Is relaxed, tolerant, and informal. You function best with a minimum of
rules, paperwork, and supervision. 
H Provides variety, excitement, and preferably a crisis or two. Repetitive,
routine work brings out the worst in you.
H Rewards those who move at a fast pace and solve problems. You enjoy
the adrenaline rushes that drive other Colors crazy.
H Gives opportunities to use troubleshooting skills. Your ability to work fast
under pressure makes you the one for projects or departments in chaos.
H Focuses on short-term problems. You need results now to feel good
about what you’re doing.
H Permits working on real things and tangible products. If you can’t see it,
touch it, taste it, hear it, or smell it, you are not interested. A day of brain-
storming feels like a waste to you, except for the camaraderie.
H Is aesthetically appealing and colorful. More than for most Colors, unat-
tractive surroundings will distract and irritate you, detracting from pro-
ductivity. You appreciate the world’s finer things, and they inspire you at
work.
H Has associates who are lively and action oriented. Energetic people
stimulate your productivity.
H Factors in needs of customers and staff. You’ll burn out in workplaces
that disregard human needs, squeezing every nickel out of each trans-
action and worker.
A corporate culture integrating the above elements is fertile soil for your
career advancement.
The worst type of work culture for an Extroverted Red/Green is one that
emphasizes long-term projects. Humor and play are frowned upon, and the

daily tone is serious. You will find it near impossible to accomplish anything
in environments that are hierarchical with many meetings and memos.
When Red/Green Extroverts work in nonideal corporate cultures, produc-
tivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Extroverted Red/Green’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Red/Greens get along
especially well with other Reds. But bosses of other Color types who possess
the characteristics in figure 12–3 can also be good mentors.
FIGURE 12–3 The Red/Green Extrovert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Is pragmatic
H Points you in the right direction and then leaves you alone
H Creates rapport through a sense of humor
H Encourages fun in the workplace
Careers That Attract Red/Green Extroverts
Like the people in our case studies, you are most attracted to careers that pro-
vide freedom, action, and the ability to be a troubleshooter. 
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals
to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color style characteristics that create suc-

CASE STUDY FOUR
When a Career Isn’t Working
Bill Lloyd was a born salesman. In his freshman year at a university, he saw
how much money college textbooks cost and was more excited by that than
the engineering major his dad wanted him to pursue. Why go to college, Bill
figured, when he could read all the texts and get paid for it? His parents dis-
owned him when he quit to work at a major college textbook publisher. 
Starting at the bottom selling the most esoteric titles, Bill quickly became
a star salesman. Within three years he was the firm’s number one sales pro-
ducer. That’s when the trouble began.
Bill was promoted to sales manager, overseeing twenty-five people selling
nationwide. He had to read not just his titles but all of them, and he hated it.
His shoot-from-the-hip style was no longer needed. Instead, he had to think
strategically about what professors wanted, a task foreign to here-and-now
Red/Green Extroverts. He had much less interaction with people, which made
him restless. He started to daydream about the days when he was flying solo
around the country, attending conventions and scoring huge sales coups.
At a meeting of top managers at the end of a stellar year, Bill’s boss half-
kiddingly bemoaned the lack of Porsche franchises in their area. The other
managers laughed; Bill started thinking. He contacted Porsche and persuaded
them to sell him an area franchise, citing his track record with the firm.
Today, Bill owns a Porsche franchise, belongs to the local country club, and
has reconciled with his parents. His Red personality gets a kick every morning
he walks into his upscale showroom. He oversees only two salespeople and
handles a number of clients himself. He finds customers at the country club
before they find him. He gets all the business he can handle with the line,
“When you’re ready for your Porsche, here’s my card.” He loves his work. 
Your Personality’s Challenges
Red/Green Extroverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some you have, others you won’t. Tone down a blind spot by focusing on it,
then choose more productive actions and make them habits. (Suggestions for
doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
C H A P T E R  1 2  |
R E D / G R E E N  E X T R O V E R T S
111

112
PA R T  3  |  R E D S
Q Tend to be casual about rules, procedures, and authority. (This is your
number one career-derailing attribute. Your superiors may need rules
and procedures to control their own job anxieties. Would that make
you respond with more respect and compassion? Try it and see how
your boss reacts.) 
Q Have difficulty planning ahead and sometimes do not follow through
on commitments. (If a commitment bogs you down, you may skip
it. You hate red tape, including making phone calls to cancel
appointments. In the professional world, it can look like you don’t
have your act together at times. Write down commitments, call
ahead of time to cancel.)
Q Hate having tight deadlines, repetitive work, and working alone.
(Reject or change jobs like this; they make you pessimistic and joyless.
When deadlines or repetitive tasks cannot be avoided, pretend they are
all ridiculous; this will lighten your mood. If possible, set yourself up
in a conference room to be near others.)
Q Get frustrated in overly serious environments where humor is not
respected. (You withdraw and become moody. If exposed to such envi-
ronments for too long and put under extreme stress, you may have vio-
lent, even abusive, outbursts.)
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
You Red/Green Extroverts would rather be out there taking action than read-
ing this. But hang in there; we’re almost done. You’ll benefit from these job-
search tricks.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Have an extensive network for job information and referrals
Q Establish a warm relationship with interviewers who allow it
Q Sell yourself well
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Force yourself to set long-term career objectives; enlist the help of
friends or family, particularly Golds (to identify, see figure 19–1 in
chapter 19, Golds Overall)

Q Consider the long-term potential of a job, for you and your family,
before accepting
Q Take a hard look at the possible downside before jumping into a job
Q Develop a thicker skin and don’t take rejections personally
Q Consistently follow through with details like phone calls, thank-you
notes, company research; get a willing Gold to help if possible
The Red/Green Extrovert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style, use the suggestions in parentheses. Mercilessly exploit these
natural abilities of yours and get more job offers. 
In following your natural style, you:
Q Speak with tact, excitement, charm, and humor. (Your immediate
charm will intimidate some interviewers. If yours does not warm up,
answer a few questions in a serious tone; see if that puts him or her
more at ease.)
Q Develop a rapport with people. (With an interviewer who seems dis-
tant, stick to the facts. Let him or her set the tone for any personal
exchanges.)
Q Are concrete and realistic about past responsibilities and accomplish-
ments. (Some interviewers will dig for feelings: “Did you like your pre-
vious boss? How did you get along with your coworkers?” Ask a Green
to help role play such questions ahead of time.)
Q Focus on the current situation and not on future or strategic issues.
(Your ability to focus on the present is a valuable asset, but your
answer may be too short when handling future-oriented questions.
Answer slowly and thoughtfully. Then emphasize your talent for turn-
ing on a dime if things change.)
Q Get to the point; you prefer to act rather than talk. (Ask for the job at
the end of the interview, but don’t rush things. Impatience will hurt
you here. If your interviewer seems indecisive, take action. Offer to
work a trial project or period.)
C H A P T E R  1 2  |
R E D / G R E E N  E X T R O V E R T S
113

Q Reply quickly and think on your feet. (Normally a plus, but some
interviewers may want more thoughtful replies. If so, sit back, look at
the ceiling, and pause, even if you know what you want to say.)
Okay, go do something exciting now. Later, skim chapter 4, “Greens
Overall,” if we’ve actually gotten you a little hooked on this stuff. You can jot
notes if you want to impress someone with your diligence in the Roadmap in
chapter 27. The Roadmap is an excellent place to keep networking notes dur-
ing a job search.

PA R T  3  |  R E D S

Red/Green Introverts
YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Red, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Green personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Introvert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being alone rather than being with oth-
ers. It’s likely you have little patience for this book and are just reading this
to please someone. So we’ll keep it pragmatic.
You Overall
Warm and attentive, Red/Green Introverts have an unusual sensitivity to peo-
ple and animals. A low need to lead or control, but a great desire to encourage
others, is your style. Small collegial teams where hierarchy is secondary to
getting the job done efficiently bring out the best in you. Where possible, you
like to operate outside norms and rules followed by others.
Realistic and pragmatic, you trust only what you have personally observed.
You have a particularly acute visual memory. 
Your communication style is straightforward. You want the facts but enjoy
an anecdote or two (particularly a humorous one). You are easygoing, fun lov-
ing, and enjoy the unexpected. Though very attentive in the moment, you
have a short attention span. 
You resist making decisions under pressure, keeping all options open as
long as possible. When ready, however, you decide with the speed of light.
CHAPTER 13

Others see you as speaking clearly without hidden agendas. They experi-
ence you as calm, modest, and cheerful. Although you are very tolerant of
most folks, you get annoyed by bossy people who insist on having things
done “the right way.”
You on the Job
AS A LEADER
You lead your staff by example. Hierarchical power structures and ruling oth-
ers with an iron fist are not your way.
Realistic about problems and outcomes, you prefer collegiality to conquest.
Your first impulse is to break tension with humor. You’ll find other Colors
require more structure than you do.
AS A TEAM PLAYER
You have common sense and a knack for getting others to focus. They trust
you—you really do want to accomplish the task at hand without playing
political games. You provide a role model for your teammates. 
All ideas floated by team members get a hearing before you begin drilling
down to the final decision. You are most likely to irritate other teammates by
being overly sensitive to people who disagree with you. 
Look at figure 13–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 13–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Like to initiate and implement change
H Bring people and tasks together in a cooperative style
H Provide supportive feedback to others
H Excel in assignments that are action oriented, practical, and nonrepetitious
H Love to overcome obstacles using a tactical approach
H Bring creativity and well-developed aesthetics to your work
H Have a strong customer service attitude, no matter what level of job you have
H Are most productive when left on your own

CASE STUDY ONE
Upper Management, Utility Field
Christopher L. Dutton has been president and CEO of Green Mountain Power
Corporation in Colchester, Vermont, since 1997. Previously, he had been its
general counsel, chief financial officer, treasurer, and vice president.
Chris started his career as a trial lawyer. He liked the work, he says,
“because each case was different.” Red/Green Introverts crave challenge and
nonrepetitious work, especially if they can be involved on a personal level. Thus
well suited to trial law, Chris spent the first decade of his career trying cases.
Today, he says, “I spend 45 percent of my time focusing on the policy
issues that confront us because we are a regulated utility company. I have to
be externally oriented; every decision we make affects the kind of power we
buy or the generating facilities that we build.” 
He is constantly dealing with politics. Five months after taking the helm, a
public service commission made a decision “that put us in extreme financial
peril,” Chris recounts. While Red/Green Introverts enjoy surprises and chal-
lenges, this stretched Chris to his professional limits. His solution? “We
figured out how to convince the regulators to change their minds in a face-
saving way without admitting they made a mistake.” Red/Green Introverts are
keen observers of human nature; this talent kept Chris’s organization viable.
Chris spends an additional 40 percent of his time “on Board relations, as
well as dealing with the financial community, investors, and ratings agencies.”
The Red/Green Introvert’s tendency to listen to all sides before making a deci-
sion helps Chris here.
He offloads the detail work (an irritant to Red/Green Introverts) to his chief
operating officer Mary Powell. “I recognize she has strengths I don’t.” 
How does Chris create the egalitarian workplace he prefers? During the
company’s early crisis days, Chris led the decision to sell its lavish offices and
move into its service center, where the line and bucket trucks were. “We
wanted everybody on the same floor; we wanted no private offices, just low
partitions where necessary. We wanted all employees to have the same
amount of office space so there could be no hidden agendas.”
Today, Chris and Mary are physically visible to 90 of their 195 employees.
“If I get a call about a sensitive matter, I’ll call back later,” Chris says. 
Answering to so many entities, Chris knows obstacles are a recurring part
of the job. But these are stimulating rather than stifling to him. Red/Green
Introverts are tactical, practical, and enjoy solving concrete problems. 
C H A P T E R  1 3  |
R E D / G R E E N  I N T R O V E R T S
117

They also value and welcome change, which gives Chris an edge in his role
as CEO. So does his Red/Green flexibility and customer service orientation. 
The open floor plan is ideal for helping Chris keep his finger on the pulse of
his organization. Red/Green Introverts thrive when they can focus on the
human side of things. As an Introvert, however, he expends extra energy cop-
ing with the resulting lack of privacy. 
Chris’s job makes ample use of his inborn Red/Green preferences. He
doesn’t have to try to be a success in this position; instead, his natural
instincts provide the right response.
CASE STUDY TWO
Innkeeper
Bud owns a cozy, twenty-room inn in Maine. He is the kind of innkeeper who
takes a personal interest in his guests and remembers them over the years.
The rugged coast of Maine and the remoteness of the town appeal to Bud, his
core of regulars, and celebrities alike. On any given night, artists may share a
common wall with Supreme Court justices.
Bud has a quiet smile and is an intent listener. He loves running the inn, but
it was never his life’s ambition.
“I had no intention of buying an inn,” Bud recalls. “After my divorce, I had
lost both my job and my house. A guy called and offered it to me, knowing it
was a way to be closer to my kids who live on an island nearby. So I looked at
it, said, ‘Whoa! This is a pretty good deal. It would give me a place to live, and
it would give me a job.’ I had enough money to buy the place mortgage free.
So I did.” Red/Greens respond well to unexpected opportunities.
True to his Color, Bud loves the flexibility of owning an inn. He enjoys the
variety of people he meets. (As an Introvert, it gives him the advantage of hav-
ing his social life come to him.) He posts no guest rules. “You don’t make
policy because one person does something upsetting,” he says. Reds dislike
policy in any case. 
“The stressful part of running an inn is the things you have no control over,
like electric power,” Bud says. He is twenty miles from any major center of
services; the town has an antiquated water system and no police department.
But a true Red, Bud takes crises as they come. “I am the chairman of the
water department here because I am the biggest user,” he says. 
118
PA R T  3  |  R E D S

Bud’s top work-related strength is delegating, which he mainly exercises
overseeing his housekeeping staff. 
Most people find his life romantic. Bud is quick to dispel the myth in down-
to-earth, practical Red fashion. “The main reason people fail as innkeepers is
they are not realistic. They overromanticize it. There is nothing romantic about
being an innkeeper. But I do like coastal life; I like looking at the ocean. It’s a
different scene every day.”
Ideal Work Environment
Beautiful, private, and relaxed—who wouldn’t want to work in a place like
Bud’s? Actually, some Colors are uncomfortable in relaxed, informal settings.
Extroverts opt for bullpens or open cubicles. But for you, it’s the most pro-
ductive way to go.
Use all the leverage you can when a job offer is made to get as much from
figure 13–2 as possible.
FIGURE 13–2 The Ideal Red/Green Introvert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. If these
descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve tested your individual Color
correctly. Other Colors, especially Golds, would find this environment uncom-
fortable and unproductive. The optimal Red/Green Introvert work environ-
ment:
H Is relaxed and informal. You function best with a minimum of rules,
paperwork, and supervision. 
H Is supportive and harmonious. Backstabbing, confrontation, and mali-
cious gossip really irritate and distract you from the task at hand.
H Permits making an immediate contribution. You need real results with
tangible products now and chafe doing grunt work in your early career
years. Brainstorming feels like a waste of time to you.
H Is aesthetically appealing. More than for most Colors, unattractive sur-
roundings will distract and irritate you, detracting from productivity.
While declining a job on the basis of ugly offices might sound frivolous,
for you it is a genuine matter of mental health.
C H A P T E R  1 3  |
R E D / G R E E N  I N T R O V E R T S
119

H Allows for private space. As an Introvert, your batteries get drained
when dealing with people, even if your people skills are superb. If you
have to share your work space with others, you will feel a lot more
fatigue at the end of the day. You think and perform better in a private
space; insist on one as a condition of employment if possible.
A corporate culture integrating the above elements is fertile soil for your
career advancement. 
The worst type of work culture for a Red/Green Introvert is one where you
are micromanaged on tight deadline projects that emphasize long-term strate-
gic thinking. The daily tone is overly serious, and humor is frowned upon.
You will find it draining to work in noisy environments that do not respect
your real need for privacy.
When Red/Green Introverts work in nonideal corporate cultures, produc-
tivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Introverted Red/Green’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Red/Greens get along
especially well with other Reds. But bosses of other Color types who possess
the characteristics in figure 13–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 13–3 The Red/Green Introvert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Points you in the right direction and then leaves you alone
H Encourages rapport through a sense of humor
H Rewards ingenuity and is not threatened by your free-wheeling ways
H Offers a high degree of trust
H Is appropriately interested in your personal life
Careers That Attract Red/Green Introverts
You are most attracted to careers that provide freedom, action, and the ability
to be of service, like Chris Dutton.
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals

CASE STUDY THREE
When a Career Isn’t Working
Mallory, a Red/Green Introvert, was a real estate salesperson and a good one.
She enjoyed the sales process and the people with whom she dealt. She even
had that marvelous Red ability to enjoy a crisis every now and then. 
But Mallory was feeling a seven-year itch. She was burning out on the
unrelenting aggressiveness of making cold calls and drumming up business.
She was a good negotiator, but pushing to close deals the way her boss
taught her never felt natural. While she enjoyed people, her Introverted
nature was feeling overwhelmed by sheer numbers, and the intrusions on her
quiet time made her edgy.
One of the properties Mallory listed was a kennel with several beautiful
surrounding acres. She found herself pointing out all its flaws to potential
customers and steering them away. Finally, she realized she wanted to buy
it herself. 
Mallory pooled all her resources and purchased the property. She moved
into its small caretaker’s cottage and started a doggie day care sideline busi-
ness. Red/Green Introverts adore animals and are very sensitive to their
needs. Within the year, she had quit her real estate job to run her business
full-time. Local celebrities loved her unique doggie pampering services;
Mallory is now able to command top dollar and has a long waiting list. 
Your Personality’s Challenges
Red/Green Introverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
We emphasize potential because you won’t have all of them. Tone down a
blind spot by deciding to see it, then choose more productive actions.
(Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q Tend to be casual with rules and procedures valued by others,
including meeting deadlines. (This is your number one career-derailing
attribute. Your superiors may need rules and procedures to control
their own job anxieties. Would that make you respond with more
respect and compassion? Try it and see how your boss reacts.) 
Q Either avoid conflict or become defensive when confronted. (You’ve
got two great tools: humor and practicality. Get control over the tone
of the interaction. Start with, or interject, humor. Then get practical
about how to resolve the issue.)

Q Hate not having control of your own schedule and having tight dead-
lines. (This makes you hyperactive, blunt, pessimistic, and joyless. For
you, it is critical to avoid or change jobs where tight deadlines are the
norm. When deadlines cannot be avoided, approach your tasks as if
they were all ridiculous; this will lighten your mood.)
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
You’d rather be out there hitting the pavement than reading this. But hang in
there; you’re almost done. You’ll benefit from these concrete job-search tips:
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Get the facts on careers and companies; you are particularly adept at
Internet research
Q Respond quickly and decisively to new opportunities
Q Weigh whether a job meets your personal values
Q Be detailed in your interview about past positions and achievements
Q Appreciate and appropriately thank others for their help and intro-
ductions
Q Assemble a small but loyal group of acquaintances who will provide
referrals and leads
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Force yourself to set long-term goals; enlist the help of friends or
family, particularly Golds (to identify, read figure 19-1 in chapter 19,
“Golds Overall”)
Q Prepare ahead for hypothetical questions; practice role playing rather
than winging it
Q Speak up in interviews, rather than just listening, to avoid appearing
“too quiet”
Q Sell, don’t just state, your accomplishments; role play to reduce dis-
comfort
Q Follow through on commitments, deadlines, and the nitty-gritty tasks
of a job search; enlist the aid of a willing Gold to help (to identify, read
chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other Styles”)

Q Hang in there when the hiring process drags on through multiple
interviews; avoid snap decisions to drop out of the race
Q Be aggressive about soliciting referrals and leads from acquaintances
and strangers as your preferred circle of friends is intimate but small
The Red/Green Introvert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style, use the suggestions in parentheses. 
In following your natural style, you:
Q Are a calm, quiet listener. (With an interviewer who asks short ques-
tions and expects long answers, take more of a lead. Practice selling
your accomplishments. Rather than egotistical, you will appear self-
confident.)
Q Develop a rapport with people. (With an interviewer who seems dis-
tant, stick to the facts. Let him or her set the tone for any personal
exchanges.)
Q Are concrete and realistic about past responsibilities and accom-
plishments. 
Q Avoid sharing personal information until trust is established. (Keeping
your distance or answering vaguely will make you look as if you have
something to hide. Use humor to gain space, if needed, then be honest.)
Q Focus on the current situation and not on future or strategic issues.
(Your ability to focus on the present is a valuable asset, but you may
be too brief when handling future-oriented questions. Answer slowly
and thoughtfully. Then emphasize your talent for turning on a dime if
things change.)
Q Prefer to act rather than talk. (Ask for the job at the end of the inter-
view, but don’t rush things. Impatience will hurt you here. If your
interviewer seems indecisive, take action. Offer to work a trial project
or period.)
Q Speak up when your values are threatened. (While this may lose you a
job, never hide this valuable instinct of yours. You will save yourself
wasted years working for firms you don’t respect.)

Okay, go do something new now. Later, check out chapter 4, “Greens
Overall,” if we’ve actually hooked you a little on this stuff. You can jot notes
if you want to impress someone with your diligence in the Roadmap in
chapter 27. It’s also a great place to keep notes during a job interview that will
help with follow-through.

BLUES
“Let’s Change It”
PART 4
Blues enjoy complex prob-
lems and work tirelessly to
improve ideas and systems
until they are just right.

BLUES REPRESENT 10 percent of the overall world population. If you are
not a Blue but want to read about how to identify or improve communications
with one, go to figure 14–1. 
FIGURE 14–1 How to Recognize a Blue

H Expresses clear and direct ideas
H Reads voraciously
H Is insatiably curious
H Has jousting wit
H Is competitive
H Often has advanced degree(s)
H Disregards opposition and what others think of him or her
Blues Overall
CHAPTER 14

How to Communicate with a Blue
H Keep relationship professional, limit chitchat, be brief and concise
H Acknowledge intellectual skills
H Emphasize your own competence; use sophisticated vocabulary
H Present the “big picture”
H Outline the theoretical framework
H Bring up comparative studies
H Limit facts and details; reduce to essentials in executive summary
H Show long-term potential of your new idea or solution
H Use ingenuity and logic
H Allow the Blue to challenge and question
H Don’t take critiques and challenges personally; these actually are signs
of interest in the topic under discussion
H Joust back with his or her jousting wit
H Avoid emotional approach and words like feel or believe
H Compose a strategy with the Blue, not for the Blue; use his or her input
Hillary Rodham Clinton—former First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the
United States, U.S. senator from New York, and secretary of state, and the
2016 Democratic presidential nominee—is one of the most interesting
women in the United States and one of the best-known Blues (who are the
rarest of the four Color types).
Growing up in Park Ridge, Illinois, Hillary was seen even as a child to be
assertive, purposeful, and determined, all in-born Blue characteristics. A tire-
less worker and consistent overachiever, she was a National Merit scholar in
high school. Her teachers noted her exceptional ability to take in information,
argue a point thoroughly, but change her mind when new input demanded it
(core Blue abilities). 
In her senior year, she was voted most likely to succeed. She went on to
become a high achiever in both college (Wellesley student body president)
and at Yale Law School.
Her Blue abilities served her well early in her career. Assigned as part of
the impeachment inquiry staff investigating President Richard Nixon in
C H A P T E R  1 4  |
B L U E S  O V E R A L L
129

1974, she worked dawn to midnight seven days a week. Hillary is remem-
bered as “determined and dutiful, grinding away in a mildewed office over-
looking an alleyway.”1 This typifies the Blue ability to work relentlessly on a
problem of interest, functioning without significant stress in solemn and
tense environments.
That summer she worked on Bill Clinton’s campaign for an Arkansas con-
gressional seat, already emotionally involved with the young up-and-comer.
Campaign manager Paul Fray struggled with the hard-nosed young woman
over the strategies he deemed his turf, but later admitted, “She was an orga-
nizational genius.”2 During her time in the White House as First Lady, Hillary
helped President Clinton draw and clarify battle lines. Her personal goals
(healthcare reform, legal rights of children) were typical of a Blues: long term,
strategic, and abstract. Hillary was and is not concerned about stepping on
toes while pursuing the ability to set her own agenda.3 When her two-decade
marriage to Bill Clinton was tested in 1996 by the Monica Lewinsky scandal
in the glare of international media, it endured, and many wondered why. Put
in Color Q terms, the answer was simple. Hillary is a Blue/Gold; Bill is a
Red/Green. (Note: Neither has reported taking the Myers-Briggs Type
Indicator questionnaire or the derivative Color Q self assessment, but these
personalities have been extrapolated by noted temperament specialists in the
Myers-Briggs community4 and author Shoya Zichy from a personal meeting
with Hillary. These results are supported by extensive research, candid con-
versations with journalists, and Hillary’s personal friends.) Bill Clinton loves
politics; she prefers making policy. He is a quick study; she, like most Blues,
has depth and focus. He looks for ways to compromise; she, in typical Blue
fashion, weighs alternative strategies. He forgives and forgets; she remembers
and keeps score. He dives into a crowd with the abandon of a Red/Green
Extrovert; she reaches out but remains at the Blue/Gold’s cool distance. He
works from the gut; she is guided by logical analysis—again, another Blue
tendency. He thrives on risk; Blue Hillary circles it cautiously.5 It’s a case of
opposites attracting—and complementing each other in deeply important
(and binding) ways for the challenges they have faced together. After her role
as First Lady of the United States ended, Hillary did what comes naturally to
all Blues: She took charge. She chose to run for a seat in the U. S. Senate and
made it happen, tactically using her political contacts and name recognition.
In 2006, when the first edition of Career Match was being written, we said,
“As of this writing she continues to place herself strategically in the spotlight
on carefully chosen issues, fueling the possibility that she herself eventually
130
PA R T  4  |  B L U E S

will run for President of the United States.” We were right, solely based on an
assessment of her personality type.
Other famous Blues in politics are Madeleine Albright, Catherine the
Great, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Al Gore, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln,
Nancy Pelosi, Condoleezza Rice, and Lady Margaret Thatcher. Microsoft
founder Bill Gates, IBM’s Lou Gerstner, business magnate and inventor Elon
Musk, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg represent Blues in the corporate
world. George Carlin, Matt Damon, Celine Dion, Walt Disney, Mia Farrow,
Tina Fey, Jodie Foster, Whoopi Goldberg, Valerie Harper, Tom Hanks,
Katharine Hepburn, and Meryl Streep illustrate the Blue style in entertain-
ment; former Citibank chairman John Reed, megainvestor George Soros, and
Charles Schwab in finance; and Albert Einstein in academia.
One look at the innovative companies Elon Musk has cofounded and run
prove this statement accurate: “His psyche is tied up in the idea of changing
the world,” says his brother. Elon was the founder of SpaceX, one of the first
private companies in space travel and one with a $1.6 billion contract with
NASA to send supplies into space and astronauts to the International Space
Station6; Tesla Motors, one of the first private companies in the electric car
industry; and a cofounder with Peter Thiel of PayPal, which has changed the
way millions of people worldwide do commerce. Blues more than most
Colors use money as a measure of self-worth; with a $12.4 billion net worth
as of 2016,7 Musk has little to worry about. Blues look farther out into the
future and see more than any other Color type. “I started SpaceX because if
we’re not on a path of expanding to the stars, then what we’re effectively say-
ing is [that] we’re going to consign ourselves to Earth until an extinction
event wipes us out,” Elon says. A Blue who grew rich on his talent for design-
ing new systems is Charles R. “Chuck” Schwab, founder and chairman of
Charles Schwab Corporation. The corporation is a leading provider of finan-
cial services, with more than 330 offices, 10.1 million client accounts, and
$2.69 trillion in client assets.8 When Schwab started his business in the
1970s, he was $100,000 in debt and going through a divorce. But he saw the
baby-boomer demographics and their meaning: 28 percent of the U.S. popu-
lation would be in the preretirement age range of 45 to 64 by the year 2010.9
And he invested big in pre-Internet technology in the late 1970s, a bet-the-
company decision which gave Schwab a crucial head start into Internet trad-
ing 
and 
investing. 
These 
two 
things 
together—demand 
and
technology—grew into a trillion-dollar business and made Chuck Schwab a
billionaire six times over.

Described by Fortune Magazine in 2005 as “private and aloof,”10 Schwab
has a demeanor that is typical of Blues who focus on systems and their
improvement. After retiring, Schwab reclaimed the CEO position of his firm
when his designated successor was deemed “not really inclined toward the
visionary, blue-sky stuff,”11 and the company floundered in the early 2000s.
Blues are the visionaries of the world, just what the company needed at that
time. He remained CEO until retiring again in 2008,12 keeping the company
focused on its strengths and improving internal processes so it “skates to
where the puck is going to be,”13 as he likes to say. As of this writing, he con-
tinues as chairman and the largest stockholder of the company he founded,
funneling some of his personal wealth into the Charles and Helen Schwab
Foundation he established a decade before retiring. Its $270 million in assets
provided $13 million in grants to organizations that help young people reach
their fullest potential and alleviate human suffering in his home state of
California and elsewhere.14
You as a Blue will critique every point made in a book like this, preferring
instead to deal with things more intellectual and less emotional. However, if
you are interested in learning how to work more effectively and efficiently
with other personality types, this book will be the key that unlocks those
secrets. Color Q shows you how to handle even the most emotional and dis-
organized people in your life. It describes what to do when all your best
efforts have failed. The most logical way to proceed with this book is to read
about your own Color first, and then learn how you interact with others by
reading their profiles as needed. You especially want to learn about Reds,
with whom you are most likely to clash because they are relentlessly present-
centered and view deadlines and commitments merely as loose guidelines in
personal and professional life. Reds, however, will help you achieve more
than you could on your own. Harness their strengths to handle crises in trou-
bled teams, departments, or companies. Turn to their present-moment think-
ing when strategic, future-oriented logic breaks down. 
You’ll also get along better with Greens and Golds. They, too, have
strengths with which you should become familiar. Successful Blue entrepre-
neurs and leaders know how to engage the strengths of each Color and hire
accordingly.
Use this chapter to determine if you’ve tested your primary Color
correctly. It also will help identify Blues among people you know, as will
chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other Styles.” We
132
PA R T  4  |  B L U E S

added figure 14–1 for other Colors to have a list of ways to identify and com-
municate with Blues. 
As a Blue, you are the rarest of the four Colors. You are the most strategic
of all personality types, thriving when grappling with complex theoretical
challenges. Your talent for new system designs brings you recognition and
appreciation.
C H A P T E R  1 4  |

133

YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Blue, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Gold personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Extrovert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being with people rather than being
alone. Your Color group makes things happen in decisive and take-charge
ways. A lifelong learner, you typically are quite well informed. It is likely you
already are challenging and critiquing this profile, if you’re at all interested in
the material. Please note that the underlying components of this profile have
been researched for nearly seven decades worldwide and verified across age,
sex, ethnic, and socioeconomic boundaries. 
You Overall
You are dynamic and capable, and your talents dominate at every step of a
project, from creating the vision to making it happen. Along the way, your
abilities to devise strategies, establish plans (and contingencies), and take
charge are all quite strong. Blue/Gold Extroverts do well in a broader range of
careers than other Colors, because of your love of lifelong learning, sharp
logic, and executive abilities.
Two core strengths combine in you to create a fast rise to the top: a high
need for control and strong leadership skills. Combined with your frank,
direct, intuitive, and focused communication style, those qualities make you
Blue/Gold Extroverts
CHAPTER 15

C H A P T E R  1 5  |
B L U E / G O L D  E X T R O V E R T S
135
an executive dynamo but at times overly challenging and alienating to those
around you. Most other Colors cannot keep up with your drive, which can
make your entire staff uncomfortable and rebellious.
The world of theories, future possibilities, and bold new designs are your
territory. Existing systems and assumptions are just jumping-off points. You
create long-range plans that incorporate ideas others do not yet see. If such
plans create complex problems to be solved, so much the better. Not only will
you marshal all necessary resources, you will gleefully solve them all.
Your greatest challenge is managing and controlling how others respond to
you. On the plus side, you often come across as articulate, vivid, and confi-
dent. You persuade others through clear logic and thoughtful debate. On the
down side, you are impatient with people who focus on what you consider
irrelevant, redundant, and obvious issues. Those who are intimidated by you
instantly lose your respect; you can’t imagine why anyone would personalize
competition or debate. 
To be an effective leader or team player, you will need to learn which other
Colors do personalize such things and adopt alternate strategies for interacting
with them. Such reactions are deep in their core, offer a different (and usable)
strength than yours, and cannot be changed by choice or willpower. 
CASE STUDY ONE
Executive Director, Youth INC
Rehana Farrell is the executive director of Youth INC, a venture philanthropy
nonprofit that transforms the lives of New York City kids by empowering the
grass-roots nonprofits that serve them in their communities.
Rehana is a builder. She likes to build new businesses, new functions, new
teams. She intellectually owns every aspect of her work and considers how it
can get better and better. The only thing she doesn’t enjoy is standing still or
maintaining the status quo.
As an executive director, or CEO, she loves the wide variety of issues on her
very full plate. From the sales function of development to the relationship man-
agement function of a thirty-five-person board to the operational efficiencies
that can be created internally or for her network of over sixty youth-serving
nonprofits, it’s all interesting to her, including particularly how things come
together. This includes the team. She is an avid student of human behavior and
actively seeks to optimize team performance through process and culture.

136
PA R T  4  |  B L U E S
Like most Blue/Gold Extroverts, Rehana is most energized by system-level
concepts and changes that have the broadest impact. She values innovation
at all levels of the organization. In Blue fashion, Rehana enjoys focusing on
the big picture, but as a backup Gold, she also appreciates that execution and
process improvements really make a difference.
Rehana is a doer as well as a thinker. She considers herself a “servant
leader” whose job is to advocate for the staff to help them all be successful.
She values commitment to the organization, project, or goal, and is with you
110 percent if you demonstrate that. If you don’t own the outcome, there are
other jobs out there for you that would be a better fit.
You on the Job
AS A LEADER 
“I don’t take no for an answer” is a phrase that must first have been uttered
by a Blue/Gold Extrovert. Once you create a vision, you spring into action,
mobilizing the talents of others, eliminating confusion and inefficiencies,
making the tough decisions. Understanding the inner workings of any organ-
ization is your special talent; you can manipulate most bureaucracies to
achieve your ends. 
You often are the first one who sees connections between unrelated facts
and ideas, which gives you an edge at handling global issues. You recognize the
potential of new ideas before others do, and your company profits accordingly.
AS A TEAM PLAYER
Your natural leadership comes to the fore even in teams. Your ability to see
the big picture and energize the group to achieve shows itself, whether you
are the team leader or not. Cutting to the core of issues saves your team time.
In order to meet deadlines, you will encourage (and work to) high standards,
avoid wasting resources, and even consider untried solutions rather than fail.
You can irritate your teammates by being overly controlling and at times
pushing too hard to get the job done. 
Look at figure 15–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 15–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:

C H A P T E R  1 5  |
B L U E / G O L D  E X T R O V E R T S
137
H Are outgoing and energetic
H Can see the big picture, create compelling visions, and make it happen
H Enjoy connecting unrelated variables when analyzing problems and
developing new systems
H Are willing, and eager, to take charge of challenging, complex problems
H Are task oriented and organized
H Constantly seek improvements
H Make tough, logical decisions
H See the long-term consequences of your decisions
H Will push your team to achieve goals, whether you are the leader or not
Now see how some Blue/Gold Extroverts use these strengths in very different
fields.
CASE STUDY TWO
Chief Executive Officer
Nobody is going to burst Michael Isaacs’s balloon, at least not any time soon.
He is the CEO of U.S. Balloon Company, the largest wholesale distributor of
balloons and related accessories in the United States. The company, which
Michael started with a $750 investment, now annually grosses $30 million. It
has 100 employees and a catalog of products that is 592 pages long.
Michael sees his function as being answerable to all the company’s con-
stituencies: employees, suppliers, customers, and bankers. “I set the direction
of the company,” he says. “I determine the targeted market and profitability
goals.”
Although he views himself more as an entrepreneur than a manager, he
works very hard at building his managerial skills. “Most of all,” he says, “I try
to get the job done by hiring the right team.”
Originally a junior high science teacher, Michael had always run side busi-
nesses to augment his family’s income. He started selling balloons in a shop-
ping mall. The business got bigger, and he left to pursue it full-time. Michael
attributes his success to his natural “persistence and persuasiveness; the
ability to translate my vision into an action plan and be very serious about
measuring results.”

He is most energized when his team makes an outstanding effort. He
prefers to deal with others in groups rather than individually, very typical of a
Blue/Gold Extrovert. Also true to his Color, he likes finance and accounting
and finds very few things boring about his business. “I try to improve every
process, even if mundane,” he says. “There is always a faster, cheaper, and
better way of doing it.”
Michael has achieved success by his own definition. “What I do must have
economic benefit for my family, employees, and other stakeholders,” he says.
Beyond that, success to Michael is being recognized by industry peers and
customers, as well as being viewed as a knowledge resource. U.S. Balloon
Company became the largest distributor of foil balloons for the largest manu-
facturer. It also became the largest supplier to the largest party-store chain in
the United States. It nurtured the party-store chain from a startup of two
stores with no computer to now over 800 locations. “True to the law of unin-
tended consequences,” says Michael, “the big party chain purchased the big
manufacturer of foil balloons. Then they purchased us to exclusively service
their balloon distribution needs nationwide. At age 71 with a three-year
agreement, not a bad way to ease into retirement . . . if I have to?”
Ideal Work Environment
If, like Rehana Farrell, you are surrounded at work by highly competent and
independent people who meet their deadlines, you are in the right place. Your
superiors must also be highly competent and professional and respect you
enough to let you work autonomously.
When a job offer is made, leverage as much as you can from the list in
figure 15–2.
FIGURE 15–2 The Ideal Blue/Gold Extrovert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. Check all
that ring true for you. If these descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve
tested your individual Color correctly. Other Colors, especially Greens and
Reds, would find this environment uncomfortable and unproductive. The opti-
mal Blue/Gold Extrovert work environment:
H Provides a demanding and competitive atmosphere
H Has high standards
138
PA R T  4  |  B L U E S

H Has highly competent bosses and coworkers
H Encourages creative approaches to long-range problems
H Rewards innovation and drive rather than playing by the rules
H Funnels you into a leadership role
H Assists you in dealing with the emotional reactions of others
H Is a well-respected institution in need of change
The worst type of work culture for a Blue/Gold Extrovert is overly bureau-
cratic and/or full of sensitive people who need exorbitant amounts of hand-
holding. Too much emphasis is put on detail work, not enough on long-range
thinking and strategizing.
When Blue/Gold Extroverts work in nonideal corporate cultures, produc-
tivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Extroverted Blue/Gold’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Blue/Golds get along especially
well with other Blues. But bosses of other Color types who possess the char-
acteristics in figure 15–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 15–3 The Blue/Gold Extrovert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Is someone you respect
H Enjoys a hearty exchange of views and does not react to debate as a
personal challenge
H Values your independence and energy
H Grants you sufficient autonomy
H Helps you deal with the emotional outbursts of others
H Shelters you from bureaucracy and detail work as much as possible
Careers That Attract Blue/Gold Extroverts
Blue/Gold Extroverts cluster in fields that provide intellectual challenge, com-
plex and theoretical problems, and mastering new technologies. Routine,
C H A P T E R  1 5  |
B L U E / G O L D  E X T R O V E R T S
139

repetitive tasks are minimized; risk taking and original projects predominate.
Autonomy, competition, and people you respect characterize jobs that
provide your highest degree of satisfaction.
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals
to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color style characteristics that create suc-
cess in that broad area. 
According to our research, jobs italicized in the lists below are predicted to
benefit from an above-average growth rate over the next several years. This
information is based on the continuously revised data provided by the U.S.
Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics on their websites O*NET

CASE STUDY THREE
A Come-from-Behind Success: 
Associate, Vault 100 Law Firm
Kat Burke’s is a story of success against significant odds. Although the Color
Q system does not measure personal resilience (which Kat has in abundance),
it does measure dynamism and leadership abilities. Kat used these, plus her
innate Blue strategic and analytic abilities, to create a come-from-behind
career path.
In order to escape a violent marriage, eighteen-year-old high school
dropout Kat needed a job. But the only things on her resume were her stints
in group homes, living on the streets, hitchhiking across the country, and wait-
ressing. But Blues don’t stay at the bottom long.
Waitressing left her vulnerable economically and to the threats of her vio-
lent husband. Logic dictated the option that would take her the furthest—both
away from her past and toward her future. She enlisted in the U.S. Army, with
the single focus of getting an education. (Blue/Golds, no matter where they
start in life, have an insatiable desire for lifelong learning.) With rebuilt self-
esteem, she set her sights on law school. Ultimately she was accepted into
the University of Pennsylvania. 
She leveraged a summer internship into a full-time position in structured
finance. This evaporated during the 2008 financial crisis, but Kat rebounded.
She secured a clerkship with a judge who had just been assigned to oversee
the bankruptcy proceedings of Lehman Brothers. On her very first day, she
was plunged into what was, at that time, the largest bankruptcy in history. 
Despite this solid resume credit, restructuring positions proved elusive as
the financial crisis took hold the next year. Kat’s prior work with an Indian tribe
casino paved her way to securing a rare open position with another tribe. Her
Blue/Gold need for control over her life propelled her to identify opportunities
where others could not.
Meantime, her partner was accepted into a postgraduate program in
London. They lived apart for more than a year until Kat decided to explore
opportunities there. Through a legal recruiter, Kat found a London position in
restructuring with one of the highest-grossing law firms in the world.

Kat has a very Blue way of summing up the abilities that have enabled her
to come as far as she has. “I can easily see the big picture, and the steps to
get there,” she says. “When confronted with a problem, I typically think of
multiple solutions and often prefer to use creative, and sometimes untested,
solutions.” But she is also a secondary Gold. “Gaining employment in the
restructuring community has been a pretty amazing feat,” she acknowledges.
“I couldn’t have done it without my deep and caring social network and the
support of family and friends.” 
Your Personality’s Challenges
Blue/Gold Extroverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some listed below you have, others you don’t. No one has them all. Tone
down a blind spot by focusing on it, then choose more productive actions and
make them habits. (Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q May decide too quickly and overlook practical considerations. (High
intellectual capability is no substitute for street smarts. You are more
than capable of determining practicalities if you decide to focus.
Especially early in your career, doing things too fast may create ineffi-
ciencies.)
Q May be too abrupt, harsh, or dogmatic. (Everyone needs allies at some
point. Alienating others is a strategic error, even if they seem less com-
petent or less intellectual. Patience is a [long-range] virtue.)
Q May pay insufficient attention to human needs and concerns. (Learn
the wisdom that lies in emotions. They underpin every successful
product and team equally with all your best strategic thinking. Once a
day, require yourself to have empathy for someone.)
Q May manipulate others to achieve goals. (It is tempting, when navigat-
ing bureaucracy, to cut to the chase. But when those people realize
you’ve manipulated them, there can be hell to pay, and no second
chances.)
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Blue/Gold Extroverts create accurate and well-presented resumes that elicit
positive responses. With some interviewers, particularly Blues and Golds, you
will feel a comfortable rapport. But with those of other Colors, you need to

prepare and rehearse responses outside your comfort zone. Many human
resources people are Greens; make a study of how to communicate effectively
with this Color group before your first interviews by reading chapter 4,
“Greens Overall.”
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Have an unusually creative job-search plan that you implement in an
orderly way
Q Perform good research on prospective companies
Q Have a wide network from which to draw job leads
Q Impress new contacts with your energy, insight, and competence
Q Predict future needs and trends, possibly creating new jobs for yourself
Q Create time lines, daily status reports, and budgets to lessen stress on
you and your family
Q Handle obstacles with creativity and strategy
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Think of what you can do in return for those who help you; your net-
working sometimes comes off as too self-serving
Q Cushion your tendency to be abrupt by extending answers beyond a
few words and listening longer
Q Learn to control your tendency to come across as arrogant; role play
with a willing Green
Q Pay attention to the personal aspects of job hunting (i.e., creating rap-
port with the interviewer and sending thank-you notes)
Q Get help with the nitty-gritty of the job search to temper your natural
impatience with administrative tasks; ask a willing Gold for assistance
Q Employ your creativity and strategic thinking to address unexpected
delays and obstacles
Q Postpone any job decision until effects on family and personal life are
reviewed

The Blue/Gold Extrovert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style (and it’s statistically likely that many will have a Green compo-
nent), use the suggestions in parentheses. Exploit these natural abilities of
yours and get more job offers. 
In following your natural style, you: 
Q Focus on future strategies. (Be ready to handle more mundane ques-
tions with equal dynamism. Don’t continually pull the conversation
back to the future.)
Q Will have multiple and well-defined long-term goals. (Also practice
talking about how you plan to “hit the ground running.”)
Q Tend to talk too much and not ask enough questions about the job. (If
it has been a while since the interviewer said anything, pause. Let him
or her ask a few questions. Prepare a list of questions about the job
ahead of time and refer to it.)
Q May not pick up on critical dynamics of corporate culture that will
impact you. Ignoring corporate culture can make a move disastrous.
(Rehash interviews with willing Greens who will help you spot such
intangibles.)
Q Logically consider the pros and cons of a job opportunity. (Never
accept a job offer on the spot. Go home and thoroughly consider how
it will impact your family and personal life.) 
Once you’ve critiqued this profile and decided we’ve gotten enough things
right to make it worthwhile, read chapter 19, “Golds Overall.” Then carefully
read up on the Greens in chapter 4 to prepare for job interviews (a large num-
ber of human resources people are Greens). Also study the Reds in chapter 9
if you have to interact with any at work or at home. 
If you are actively engaging in a job search, keep notes in the Roadmap in
chapter 27. Recording your strengths and strategies is a concrete and results-
oriented way to navigate the minefields of a job search and promote creative
thinking.

YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Blue, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Gold personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Introvert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being alone rather than being with peo-
ple. People in your Color group rise to the top of any profession that requires
strategic thinking because you work tirelessly to very high standards. You
excel at creating new systems and ideas. 
You already have begun challenging and critiquing the last few claims,
especially if you have any interest in this material. Please note that the under-
lying components of the following profile have been researched for nearly
seven decades worldwide and verified across age, sex, ethnic, and socioeco-
nomic boundaries. 
You Overall
Creative, focused, and quite independent, you are superior at establishing
links between seemingly unrelated ideas and facts. From such mental intrica-
cies you construct models of anything from the cities of tomorrow to the con-
spiracy theories of yesterday.
Like your cousins the Blue/Gold Extroverts, you, too, have strengths to
apply at all phases of a project. You can create the vision, devise the strategy,
establish plans and contingencies, and make it all happen.
Blue/Gold Introverts
CHAPTER 16

Unlike them, you come across as more calm, self-reliant, and enigmatic.
Your deep powers of concentration make it seem as if you are in another
world at times, but that’s just you working with tireless focus on your latest
project. Opposition does not intimidate you or shake your utter faith in your
own insights. Your impressive scope of knowledge usually overcomes any
challenges.
The world of theories, future possibilities, and bold new designs is your ter-
ritory. Existing systems and assumptions to you are just jumping-off points.
Departments or companies that need new direction will flourish using your
long-range plans that incorporate ideas others do not yet see. If such plans cre-
ate complex problems to be solved, so much the better. Not only will you mar-
shal all the necessary resources, you will gleefully solve all the problems.
Your greatest challenge is managing and controlling how others see and
respond to you. On the plus side, you come across as clear thinking, thought-
ful, and insatiably curious. You persuade others through clear logic and con-
vincing debate. On the down side, you are impatient with people who focus
on what you consider irrelevant, redundant, and obvious issues. To avoid
these irritants, you prefer written communications over face-to-face ones. 
To be an effective leader or team player, however, you will need to adopt
alternate strategies for working with Colors who do personalize things. Such
reactions are deep in their core, offer a different (and usable) strength than
yours, and cannot be changed by choice or willpower.
CASE STUDY ONE
Coach for Small and Medium-Size Businesses
Jeannette Hobson’s high-powered New York career has made her a visible
force in the small- and medium-size business communities. It all started with
a young woman who lacked courage. “I considered a career in international
business,” says Jeannette. “But I didn’t have the courage actually to go
alone, find a job, and live on my own in a different land.”
Instead, she found a training program for female college graduates at
AT&T, moving eventually into a twenty-year career as a vice president of
investment management at the Bank of New York. There, Jeannette sold eco-
nomic- and investment-strategy services to corporations, a natural fit for a
Blue. “I enjoy blue-sky thinking,” she says. She progressed to managing
investment portfolios for high-net-worth individuals and small pension funds,
ultimately managing a team of eight.

PA R T  4  |  B L U E S
But Jeannette envisioned a broader future. Today, she runs CEO peer advi-
sory groups for Vistage International, the world’s largest CEO membership
organization. She also coaches, on a monthly basis, fifty CEOs of small-to-
medium-size companies. “Coaching and facilitating meetings draws on my
natural strengths,” says Jeannette. “I just ask probing questions.”
At one of her sessions, for example, those probing questions helped a leading
provider of commercial coin-operated laundry equipment realize that technolo-
gy would be the company’s single greatest competitive advantage. Strategizing
around this theme doubled the company’s growth rate and resulted in a very
lucrative acquisition. 
As an Introvert, Jeannette finds it stressful to network in groups of com-
plete strangers and to make cold prospecting calls to form new CEO groups.
She admits to overpreparing for presentations: “Impromptu is very stressful
for me.” Her top three strengths, typical for her Color group, are thinking/ana-
lyzing, listening, and planning future strategies.
Today, if given the opportunity, she would live and work in a foreign land.
But her family and the job of her passion keep her in New York. Instead she
travels for fun.
You on the Job
AS A LEADER 
“I don’t take no for an answer” is a phrase that must first have been uttered
by a Blue/Gold. Once you create a vision you spring into action, mobilizing
the talents of others, addressing confusion and inefficiencies, making the
tough decisions. Understanding the inner workings of any organization is one
of your unique talents, and you can manipulate most bureaucracies to achieve
your ends. 
You often are the first one who sees connections between unrelated facts
and ideas, which gives you an edge at handling global issues. You recognize the
potential of new ideas before others do, and your company profits accordingly.
AS A TEAM PLAYER
While not keen on the rapport-building aspects of working on a team, your
contributions nevertheless are substantial. You bypass small talk, going
straight to the big picture. After a few precise and penetrating questions,
you’ve cut to the core of even the most complex problems and begun synthe-
sizing a strategy. Often you leave your teammates in the dust. If they have to

ask what you consider to be obvious or incompetent questions, your impa-
tience flares. Often you tap your foot waiting for others to catch up and see
what’s been obvious to you from the start.
To amuse yourself, you formulate unusual insights and run through
untried and unique solutions. When your teammates finally understand the
problem, you’re there, ready with (one or more) solutions. You make fast
decisions once you have reviewed all known data.
This may make team members feel rushed or pressured; it also can excite
and galvanize them to action. Often you find yourself in the role of catalyst,
moving the group to timely completion of deadlines using minimal time and
resources yet working to highest standards. 
Look at figure 16–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 16–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Are often the first to see the big picture
H Are highly focused and goal oriented
H Deal well with complex problems
H Develop sophisticated new systems using the latest technology
H Strategize final outcomes accurately
H Work well with other competent people
Now see how some Blue/Gold Introverts use these strengths in very differ-
ent fields.
CASE STUDY TWO
Vice President, Applications Development
If the technological singularity (in which superintelligent computers evolve
beyond human control and intelligence capabilities) ever happens, Larry
Spencer might be one of its survivors. He has been a programmer of business
software for most of his life, making significant contributions, especially
during the digital industry’s early years.
C H A P T E R  1 6  |
B L U E / G O L D  I N T R O V E R T S
149

“In the late 1980s,” he says, “I wrote insurance quotation software that
was bought and used by large insurance companies.” 
Larry worked for a large insurance company, performed his own contract
programming, and ran his own company for three years. Like most Blue/Golds,
he focuses intently on his selected tasks, with an eye toward making a signif-
icant impact on the world. Programming has held his fascination for close to
four decades. “One unfulfilled goal I have is to get involved in artificial intelli-
gence work,” he says. Ultimately, he would like to be considered a famous
software programmer. 
Today, Larry has set his sights on one of those distant horizons that Blues
perceive better than other personality types. “I would like to stay healthy
enough to benefit from new technology that will enable me to go to age 200,”
he says.
When he’s not planning this (long) future, Larry is a programmer, team
leader, and mentor at ScerIS in Sudbury, Massachusetts. The software his
company creates enables organizations to quickly develop, deploy, modify,
and manage business practices critical to the needs of internal and external
corporate clients. 
Larry leads an international team of software developers, but this Introvert
admits the mostly solitary activity of programming is his first love. “The design
and programming of software is the most absorbing to me,” he says,
“because it is aesthetically satisfying.”
What does someone fascinated by technological singularity and artificial
intelligence do in his spare time? Besides going to the gym and hiking (which
support the health he is planning to extend technologically), Larry says, “I
read and go to meet-up groups on philosophy.”
Being able to inject the deepest and best of human thought into the digital
world while operating at optimal strength in a mostly bionic body could be
why he may just survive—or even exploit—the singularity.
CASE STUDY THREE
Music Composer, Television and Motion Pictures
Joshua Stone can take still pictures and make a piano describe what’s in
them. He can sit at a keyboard, ask you to name an emotion, and create it
150
PA R T  4  |  B L U E S

through his fingertips. He can play the same fifteen-second music bridge over
and over for seven days, improving it with each pass, and never get bored.
And yet this Emmy Award winner describes his achievements writing music
for movies and television with great modesty: “As a child, I didn’t think, ‘I am
going to grow up and write music that nobody notices.’ That is essentially
what I do.”
Music is a very direct conduit to Joshua’s emotions. He is highly disciplined
about codifying those emotions to enhance movies and TV programs. He has
written for CBS News, A&E Network, the Smithsonian Institute, and
Nickelodeon, and scored films about fine artists, among other projects. 
“I have to understand the period of the time these people lived in to ade-
quately compose music about them,” Joshua says. Like most Blues, he enjoys
the research phase of his work. He has composed in many musical styles,
from 1930s swing music to various African styles. “I now actually feel there’s
no style I couldn’t compose in,” he says. “I found that if I subjugated my per-
sonality in service of the project at hand, it broadened the boundaries of what
I had previously thought was possible.”
Joshua is the founder of Song Book World (SBW), which creates cross-
cultural collaborations with Africa, New Zealand, and his New England home
area, the Berkshires. The organization is dedicated to the notion that songs
connect everyone to everyone else. SBW (songbookworld.org) continuously
invites community organizations, teachers, and students to play together for
concert events and in-school programs.
Joshua can talk about music endlessly, attributing his continuing fascina-
tion to his curiosity and insatiable desire to keep learning, both typical Blue
qualities. “There’s no amount that’s too much to learn to be good at what I do.
Generally speaking, I’m not good at marketing, but people can see my
curiosity and the passion I have,” he says.
Like most Blues, Joshua is very into using technology in his work. “There
are production techniques enabled by widespread Internet access now that
provide many more ways to collaborate with partners around the world,” he
says. “Also within my own software programs are many things I didn’t know
could be done. When I discover them, I can’t wait to tweak the results in my
studio and share it with others around the globe.”
Fortunately for Joshua, the business and bookkeeping side that Blues hate
is minimal for him. “It’s not too much fun,” he says, “but with the advent of
computers, the billing isn’t bad.”
C H A P T E R  1 6  |
B L U E / G O L D  I N T R O V E R T S
151

He works alone for hours and often works for clients he’s never met. That
suits his Introverted side just fine. “When clients have musical knowledge, it
can be even worse than when they don’t,” he says.
Joshua’s top three strengths would sound surprising to anyone but another
Blue. “I can take criticism,” he says. “My biggest strength is my curiosity. And
I always had great self-discipline.” 
Ideal Work Environment
Key to your job satisfaction are four conditions: smart, competent, competi-
tive, and independent coworkers, like Larry Spencer has; control over your
own projects, like Joshua Stone has; intellectual stimulation from complex
problems and continuous learning, like Jeanette Hobson has; and privacy to
think things through in great depth. If all these conditions are present within
your workplace as they are at Jeannette Hobson’s, your success (barring poli-
tics) is inevitable. 
When a job offer is made, leverage as much as you can from the list in
figure 16–2.
FIGURE 16–2 The Ideal Blue/Gold Introvert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. Check all
that ring true for you. Don’t be deceived if these descriptions seem obvious. It
confirms you’ve tested your individual color correctly. Other Colors, especially
Greens and Reds, would find this environment uncomfortable and unproduc-
tive. The optimal Blue/Gold Introvert work environment:
H Must provide privacy for uninterrupted thought
H Affords ability to work independently
H Permits control of your own projects
H Must be intellectually challenging with high standards
H Values creativity
H Rewards your strategic skills
H Contains competent and competitive people
H Compensates you for meeting your goals

PA R T  4  |  B L U E S

B L U E / G O L D  I N T R O V E R T S
153
The worst type of work culture for a Blue/Gold Introvert is overly bureau-
cratic. It is full of sensitive people who need exorbitant amounts of hand-
holding. Too much emphasis is put on detail work, not enough on long-range
thinking and strategizing. You need private space with unbridled creativity
and competition in order to feel comfortable at work. 
When Blue/Gold Introverts work in nonideal corporate cultures, produc-
tivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Introverted Blue/Gold’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Blue/Golds get along especially
well with other Blues. But bosses of other Color types who possess the char-
acteristics in figure 16–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 16–3 The Blue/Gold Introvert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Is a well-respected expert in the field
H Can make the tough decisions
H Sets high standards for you and him- or herself
H Encourages creative problem solving
H Gives you a high degree of autonomy
H Trusts and respects your competence
Careers That Attract Blue/Gold Introverts
Autonomy is critical to you. Environments that reward original thinking,
solving complex problems, and mastering new technology provide fertile soil
for a stellar career like Joshua Stone’s.
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals
to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color style characteristics that create suc-
cess in that broad area. 

According to our research, jobs italicized in the lists below are predicted to
benefit from an above-average growth rate over the next several years. This
information is based on the continuously revised data provided by the U.S.

CASE STUDY FOUR
When a Career Isn’t Working
Web designer Rory MacAfee was having a bad day. The design he knew from
research and testing would work best for his firm’s biggest client had just
been shot down. Even Rory’s boss was shocked. Rory knew there would be
some long hours and difficult challenges ahead.
The client had insisted on “something more artistic and less logical-
sounding; something more today and less futuristic.” All the appreciation
Rory had been anticipating for his long hours and deep strategic thought had
evaporated. In its place came a nightmare of requests he had no clue how to
fulfill. He wished he owned the brilliant design and its vast potential. But all
his work was copyrighted by his employer. Rory had no alternative but to
struggle with the client’s requests.
After college, he had been so enthused about web design. He saw it as a
way to spend the day doing what he loved: programming and being around
other techies. This had happened, but Rory never anticipated the amount of
artistic demands he had to handle, for which he frankly had little aptitude.
Today’s dressing down was the worst yet; he could feel his temples start to
throb with yet another of the excruciating tension headaches he’d started
having since he took this job.
Rory knew that day he had to make a change. He started talking to Tetiran,
his cubicle neighbor, about the idea of starting a firm of their own. Tetiran
was enthusiastic. So were Tetiran’s rich relatives, who bankrolled the two
young programmers to start their own company designing security software
for financial corporations.
Rory’s role in the new firm was strategic planning and implementation. He
took to it like a fish to water. Today he loves his job and deals with matters of
future rather than artistic direction. He and Tetiran own all the programs
they’ve created and are well on their way to making their first million. 
Your Personality’s Challenges
Blue/Gold Introverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some listed below you have, others you don’t. No one has them all. Tone
down a blind spot by focusing on it, then choose more productive actions and
make them habits. (Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
156
PA R T  4  |  B L U E S

C H A P T E R  1 6  |
B L U E / G O L D  I N T R O V E R T S
157
Q May be too abrupt, harsh, or dogmatic. (Everyone needs allies at some
point. Alienating others is a strategic error, even if they seem less com-
petent or less intellectual. Patience is a [long-range] virtue. Emotions
underpin every successful product and team equally with all your best
strategic thinking. Once daily, require yourself to show empathy to
someone and note the results.)
Q Can be unwilling to open your complex thought processes to review
or challenge. (You may find it difficult even to get people to understand
your deep and brilliant insights, much less agree with or sign off on
them. But refusing to discuss them until the end of a project, then
being unwilling to change them at that point, is a bad strategy. Break
your plan down into steps, and then share it from the beginning to pre-
vent opposition.)
Q Believe you must do things yourself because no one else is capable.
(This comes off as arrogance, which coworkers and bosses resent.
They may not do things your way, but each Color brings strengths to
the table that you may or may not recognize. There are many paths to
the same destination, some even better than yours. Don’t you at least
want to know what they are?)
Q May irritate others by being overly skeptical when information is pre-
sented. (Many Colors take this as a personal challenge, thinking you
don’t trust or respect their work. Ask all the questions you want, but
soften them with the lead-in phrase, “This seems like good work that
you’ve spent considerable time on. I have some questions, if you
don’t mind.”) 
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Blue/Gold Introverts are direct and to the point, creating resumes that follow
a systematic process of presenting career achievements. With some interview-
ers, particularly Blues and Golds, you will feel a comfortable rapport. But with
those of other Colors, you need to prepare and rehearse responses outside your
comfort zone. Many human resources people are Greens; make a study of how
to communicate effectively with this Color group before your first interviews.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Create measurable and long-term goals for your career

Q Research and integrate new trends into your job-search plan
Q Get jobs created for you by presenting enough innovative ideas
Q Follow through on leads
Q Create time lines, daily status reports, and realistic budgets for your
job search that reduce stress on you and your family
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Think outside your select but limited network of associates; overcome
your reluctance to ask for job leads from those you don’t know
Q Pay attention to the personal aspects of job hunting (i.e., establishing
rapport with the interviewer, sending thank-you notes, overtly appre-
ciating the efforts of secretaries and support staff you encounter)
Q Cushion your tendency to be abrupt by extending answers and listen-
ing without interrupting
Q Realize when you’re sounding arrogant so you can control it at will;

The Blue/Gold Introvert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style (and it’s statistically likely that many will have a Green compo-
nent), use the suggestions in parentheses.
In following your natural style, you: 
Q Will impress interviewers as competent and insightful. (A Green inter-
viewer will ask emotion-based questions like, “Did you enjoy those
duties?” Be prepared with answers more extended than “Yes.” A Red
interviewer also will want to establish some kind of rapport.)
Q May come across as arrogant or too abstract. (It is not necessary to
humble yourself, but don’t attempt to build up your accomplishments
at anyone’s expense. Show respect for previous colleagues so future
158
PA R T  4  |  B L U E S

ones know they can expect it too. You’ll gain no points by overwhelm-
ing your interviewer with highly technical jargon. Keep in it plain
English; let your resume communicate your abilities.)
Q Might not convey enough enthusiasm during the interview. (You are
passionate about ideas, but don’t express it freely. Role play sharing
just a little of that passion; ask a willing Green or Red. You’ll come
across as really wanting the job. This also will overcome your tendency
to appear enigmatic.)
Q May need to be more flexible when considering a job offer. (“My way
or the highway” is not a good strategy for negotiating duties and com-
pensation. Listen, counteroffer, take a day to think through what’s
right for you and your family, and counteroffer again. Establish in
advance realistic boundaries for what is acceptable; don’t make it a
competitive fight to the death.)
Once you’ve critiqued this profile and decided we’ve gotten enough things
right to make it worthwhile, read chapter 19, “Golds Overall,” then carefully
read chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other Styles,”
to learn about the strengths of other Colors. Read up on the Greens to prepare
for job interviews (a large number of human resources people are Greens) and
the Reds if you have to interact with any at work or at home. 
If you are actively engaging in a job search, keep notes in the Roadmap in
chapter 27. Recording your strengths and strategies is a logical and results-
oriented way to navigate the minefields of a job search. You also can keep
track of contacts for follow-up.

YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Blue, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the adventurous Red personality. And you have tested as a Color Q
Extrovert, which means you recharge your batteries by being with people
rather than being alone. Your Color group prides itself on finding innovative
ways to do things. You take initiative and surmount all limitations with a can-
do attitude. Please note that the underlying components of the following pro-
file have been researched for nearly seven decades worldwide and verified
across age, sex, ethnic, and socioeconomic boundaries. So if we don’t get you
right, nobody will.
You Overall
Blue/Red Extroverts radiate a contagious enthusiasm for anything that cap-
tures their interest. You constantly scan the universe for those new and
unusual ideas that fire your vivid imagination. Creative and insightful, you
love the challenge and excitement of pursuing your latest goal—until it ceases
to interest you. But until then, you are tireless, energizing others as you
charge ahead.
Whether you’ve got advanced degrees or not, you are blessed with high
intellectual energy, constantly on the alert for the latest and greatest opportu-
nities. When you see them, you pounce. Inquisitive and clever, you need a

CHAPTER 17

great deal of freedom to use your many talents. A flexible environment is key.
Unconventional approaches are fun for you, and you will bend or break rules
as needed to make things happen. Following through to the bitter end once
the project has been launched, however, is of little interest. 
You are used to people disagreeing with your perceptions. Whether others
agree with you is not important. Since childhood you’ve enjoyed an inborn
ability to debate from either side of an issue, confounding opponents at times
by jumping back and forth. You are naturally quick on your feet. Ultimately,
your enthusiasm and the compelling power of your ideas persuade all.
You are unique among the Colors for your ability to be both serious and
humorous, speaking with passion and wit. However, you prefer logic to emo-
tion and are irritated by others who require too much hand-holding. People
who refuse to consider new ways of doing things really annoy you.
CASE STUDY ONE
Vice President, Human Resources/Social Services
There are few jobs as challenging as meeting the special needs of troubled
youths and their families. The can-do attitude Blue/Red Extroverts like
Deborah Finley-Troup possess has helped hundreds of New York City families
find their way to become educationally proficient, economically productive,
and socially responsible community members.
A thirty-year veteran of nonprofit human resources and training, Deborah
today handles human resources for the Children’s Village in New York City.
She began her career there as a direct care worker at their school for
troubled children. Her Blue/Red Extrovert’s unique blend of seriousness and
humor engaged and managed her young clients very effectively. But Blues
never linger at the junior level. Deborah quickly advanced to manager, then
director of training and development.
One of her greatest successes came during her time at the New York
Foundling Hospital. There, her Blue strategic gifts met their perfect challenge.
“I led a strategic planning process which resulted in large organizational
change,” she says. “One large organization was split into three more effective
and mission-targeted organizations.” For a Blue personality, making a positive
impact on the world is a primary goal and a source of deep fulfillment.
Today, Deborah is responsible for all the diverse human resources
aspects of the Children’s Village and CV Management Services. This includes
managing the human resources and learning and development departments

B L U E / R E D  E X T R O V E R T S

administering for four not-for-profit organizations—everything from attract-
ing, hiring, and training 1,500 employees serving thousands of children and
families annually to running a day care program for employees. “I am good
at designing new strategies for recruitment, retention, and development of
staff and managers,” says Deborah.
Being a red secondary type enables Deborah to identify problems and sup-
port employees who are difficult or challenging. When unconventional
approaches are called for, this personality type jumps right into the thick of
things, quickly able to identify opportunities and solutions.
State and federal audits fall under her purview—a task better left to detail-
oriented Golds. Such focus on detail work stifles a Blue/Red’s intellectual
energy. “I don’t like to do them,” Deborah says simply.
What Deborah does enjoy currently is an initiative for undoing institutional
racism. “I find that challenging and exciting,” she says. “I do leadership train-
ing and development, and create succession planning programs. I like to
develop new programs,” she says. This is not unusual for Blues, who can
visualize a broader horizon than the other Color types.
But it is her Red secondary personality that leads the way when it is time
to kick back, relax, and recharge. Reds are the most physically oriented; for
Deborah, relaxing does not mean staying still. “I walk, I bike, I kayak, and I
canoe,” she says. 
Through working with others, Deborah is able to support the Children’s
Village and four other not-for-profit organizations to offer a continuum of serv-
ices that serve diverse populations of children and families. Programs
address a variety of issues such as behavioral problems, mental illness,
homelessness, education, domestic abuse, substance abuse, life skills, hous-
ing, and employment. Deborah says, “We work within systems of immigration,
juvenile justice, and child welfare with the primary goal of keeping children
and families together.” 
You on the Job
AS A LEADER 
“Let’s exceed goals!” would be the theme of any pep talk given by a Blue/Red
Extrovert. You lead and motivate with energy, taking initiative, making the tough
decisions, being comfortable with risk. Your well-developed problem-solving
skills and tendency to challenge conventional wisdom move everyone forward. 
162

C H A P T E R  1 7  |
B L U E / R E D  E X T R O V E R T S
163
You set the bar high for your people, and you don’t hire the marginally
competent. Your people exceed limitations and quickly adapt to changing
conditions because you respect their independence. This is especially critical
since you often gravitate to global issues.
AS A TEAM PLAYER
A can-do approach is how you begin each project. You are apt to suggest high
standards and encourage everyone to go the extra mile. Contributing best at
the first half of a project, you ask imaginative questions and provide clear
analysis. Your ability to think strategically long term always helps set team
direction. When coping with fatigue and tension, humor is your tool of choice.
Finding unique ways of solving problems is another strength, and you
will generate many options for consideration. While it is unusual for team-
mates to dislike you, you occasionally may irritate them by proposing too
many possibilities.
Look at figure 17–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 17–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Are particularly good at startups or the initial stage of a project
H See the big picture
H Inspire others through energy, enthusiasm, and colorful communication
H Take an interest in complex problems
H Are energized when seeking new and more creative solutions
H Enjoy brainstorming and are one of the most effective Colors at it
H Can work with a broad range of people
H Analyze situations objectively
H Reduce tension with humor
H Are willing to take risks
Now see how some Blue/Red Extroverts use these strengths in very
different fields.

CASE STUDY TWO
Surgeon
Charles “Chuck” Sheaff is a classic Blue/Red Extrovert. He got his undergrad-
uate degree in engineering and intended to become a biomedical engineer.
“In medical school, I got sidetracked,” he says. “I ended up getting a Ph.D. in
biochemistry instead. Then I became more interested in surgery, because
there’s a lot of immediate gratification in it. At the end of an operation, the
problem is fixed and the person usually gets well and goes home.”
With his Red backup, Chuck was drawn to emergency surgery, which he
taught for two years. “When I am faced with a patient who is bleeding to
death and a lot of things have to be done in a short period of time, that tends
to make me more focused and organized,” he says. “I tend to be almost easier
to get along with then than I am in some other situations.”
One thing Chuck’s Red side enjoys is flying. “I like instrument flying,” he
says, “and solving the navigational problems.” This is an excellent combina-
tion of his Blue and Red characteristics.
Chuck served in leadership positions at his hospital for ten years. “I like
politics,” he says. “It’s rewarding to solve problems in a political arena.”
Blue/Red Extroverts make excellent politicians and are drawn to the politics
of any field in which they work.
In classic Blue/Red Extrovert fashion, Chuck uses his engineering skills
to create innovative solutions wherever he is. “I saw a Christmas tree hang-
ing upside down in a shop, and it made more sense that the ornaments could
hang so they were easily seen,” he recalls. “I devised a way to keep the tree
better watered upside down, and the project worked out well. The tree
stayed alive until Easter.” A true Blue innovator, Chuck fantasizes about
establishing a small think tank organization. “It would be fun,” he says, “to
have some people working for me to solve problems, invent new things, and
take them to market.”
CASE STUDY THREE
Chair/CEO, Executive Recruiting
Some people’s resumes are too big for ordinary jobs, and such is the case
with Charles W. B. Wardell III. If you don’t know his name, you are not high

enough up in the corporate food chain. Chuck is chair and CEO of the top ten
executive search firm Witt/Kieffer. He is also former global chairman for the
Association of Executive Search Consultants and former managing director
for the Northeast Region of Korn/Ferry International, the world’s largest
recruiting firm. He reached the top of the ladder in his field because his own
background brought him into contact with many high-level people and he fos-
tered these relationships. Today he knows who to call for almost any
executive placement or leadership need.
After a distinguished career in the military and graduation from Harvard
University, Chuck worked for Henry Kissinger as deputy assistant secretary of
state. He served in the White House under two presidents. He was the chief
operating officer of American Express’s private bank and ran its Middle
East credit card division. He also managed the Business Diversification
Group, a large division of Travelers Insurance. “Executive search requires
years of assessing and leading people,” he says, “dealing with their suc-
cesses and failures, formulating the building blocks of what they need to get
ahead in their careers.”
Chuck likes meeting the demands of today’s changing workforce, dealing
with baby boomers, whose experience now suddenly is back in vogue—or
with millennials, who embrace innovation. “Firms are beginning to realize they
have to invest [in] and keep good people,” he notes. “Companies are demand-
ing experience and performance over academic credentials.”
Chuck most enjoys the variety his work affords him, something important
to his Color style. He especially likes working with those at senior levels on
important issues, where the people he manages and advises have real-world
impact. “What I do helps to influence how the capitalist system works,” he
says. But Chuck has three priorities for himself—maintaining his health, keep-
ing his independence, and enjoying his work—all hallmarks of his Color style.
Blues enjoy complex challenges more than many Colors, and that’s a good
thing because Witt/Kieffer operates in sectors like healthcare and education
that are undergoing major overhauls. “Healthcare is changing from an
industry that used to do almost all of its business in hospitals to one that oper-
ates in specialized centers and clinics and even Walgreens or CVS. How do
you help clients find executives to run organizations that look nothing like they
did in the past?”

Ideal Work Environment
The opportunity to meet stimulating, powerful, and influential people often
is the key that gets you to accept a job. Working on cutting-edge ideas is right
where you want to be. 
When a job offer is made, leverage as much as you can from the list in
figure 17–2.
FIGURE 17–2 The Ideal Blue/Red Extrovert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. If these
descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve tested your individual Color
correctly. Other Colors, especially Golds, would find this environment uncom-
fortable and unproductive. The optimal Blue/Red Extrovert work environment:
H Provides a variety of tasks and projects
H Is creative, entrepreneurial, and nonstructured
H Rewards expertise and quick thinking
H Creates new products and solutions
H Is a continuous opportunity for new learning
H Lets you assemble a competent staff of people who do not need to be
micromanaged
H Offers the opportunity to interact with powerful or influential people
The worst type of work culture for a Blue/Red Extrovert is one in which
you are micromanaged and surrounded by coworkers who lack initiative. It
emphasizes detailed work with predictable results. 
When Blue/Red Extroverts work in nonideal corporate cultures, productiv-
ity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Extroverted Blue/Red’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Blue/Reds get along especially
well with other Blues. But bosses of other Color types who possess the char-
acteristics in figure 17–3 also can be good mentors.

H Can make tough decisions
H Is competent and respected
H Keeps bureaucracy at bay
H Has a sense of humor
H Does not micromanage you
H Sets high standards
H Values and rewards innovation
H Provides all necessary resources to ensure tasks are accomplished
Careers That Attract Blue/Red Extroverts
Blue/Red Extroverts are most productive in environments that reward their
intellectual energy, original ideas, and risk taking. You especially enjoy
original projects dealing with global issues. 
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals
to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color style characteristics that create suc-
cess in that broad area. 
According to our research, jobs italicized in the lists below are predicted to
benefit from an above-average growth rate over the next several years. This
information is based on the continuously revised data provided by the U.S.
Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics on their websites O*NET

CASE STUDY FOUR
When a Career Isn’t Working
Brad Kittering’s great-grandfather had founded the First National Bank in the
town where he grew up, and Brad determined to go into banking to follow
family tradition.
From the day Brad started at First National as a bank teller, it looked to the
world like another young Kittering was on his way up the ladder to the bank
president’s office. Brad was great with the customers and rapidly developed
a loyal group of depositors who never complained if he made a mistake.
Behind the scenes, he was a disaster. Try as he might, Brad miscounted
money, was terrible at following the bank’s many arcane rules, and was bored
out of his skull dealing with the details of his drawer. He was warned several
times to shape up and would have been fired but for his last name.
Brad was intrigued by the internal bank newsletter and on a whim con-
tributed an article on how to deal with difficult customers. It was very well
received, and a highly regarded banking trade journal asked to run it nation-
wide. Blue/Red Extroverts make excellent journalists because they are inter-
ested in people to the point of nosiness and often are good writers. 
Brad continued submitting articles and was asked to be a regular columnist
to the trade journal. Today he writes and lectures on banking customer
service through his own consulting company.

Your Personality’s Challenges
Blue/Red Extroverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some listed below you have, others you don’t. No one has them all. Tone
down a blind spot by focusing on it, then choose more productive actions and
make them habits. (Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q Initiate too many projects, some of which don’t get completed. (You
can get swept away by your own enthusiasm. A good rule for you:
Don’t start something until you’ve finished the last project.)
Q Can be too casual about deadlines and commitments. (Work is fun,
but it’s still work. If you’re getting paid to meet deadlines, then meet
them. Your work ethic will incorporate this value more as you mature
and get yelled at by your bosses.)
Q Intimidate those less quick witted. (You have little use for those less
competent than yourself. Particularly when you’re young, it’s a sport to
run them around verbally. But one of them could end up as your boss.) 
Q Sometimes change plans and strategies too frequently. (If you’re work-
ing on your own, you will lose focus; within a company, you will upset
all those whose talents you need to make things happen. Lost focus
often equals lost money.)
Q Want too much of the limelight. (Put yourself out to be noticed when
someone else deserves the attention and you create bad blood. Be sure
to share the limelight once you have it with those who deserve
applause—or else watch your back.) 
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Blue/Red Extroverts create succinct, objective resumes but prefer talking in
person. With some interviewers, particularly Blues and Reds, you will feel a
comfortable rapport. But with those of other Colors, you need to prepare and
rehearse responses outside your comfort zone. Many human resources people
are Greens; make a study of how to communicate effectively with this Color
group before your first interviews.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Find multiple paths to explore during job searches
Q Have an extensive network to tap for referrals and job leads
170
PA R T  4  |  B L U E S

Q Rebound quickly from obstacles and rejections
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Write down long-term goals and your plans for getting there; include
priorities and checkpoints
Q Limit your time off to play during the job search
Q Remember your goals while networking and don’t get lost in the fun
of it
Q Make a budget for your job search based on a realistic timeframe
Q Follow through on all administrative details of the job search; ask
assistance from a willing Gold
Q Temper initial excitement about a prospective job; review impact on
your family and personal life before accepting
The Blue/Red Extrovert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style, use the suggestions in parentheses. 
In following your natural style, you: 
Q Come across as energetic, flexible, adaptable, and creative. (You estab-
lish rapport with interviewers easily. With cooler ones, address them
by their last names until invited to use first names, then let them set
the tone.)
Q Might talk too much and not ask enough pertinent questions. (Write
critical questions down on a list and refer to them. Slip them in
between the fun parts of the conversation.)
Q May overwhelm more concrete types with possibilities and theory. (If
your interviewer seems to glaze over when you go into theoretical
areas, back away. Let the person lead the conversation until you can
assess his or her areas of interest.)
If you’re having fun with this material, read chapter 9, “Reds Overall,” to
understand your backup. Then carefully read chapter 24, “Before I Do
Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other Styles,” to learn about the strengths of

other Colors. Read up on the Greens to prepare for job interviews (a large
number of human resources people are Greens) and the Golds if you have to
interact with any at work or at home. 
If you are actively engaging in a job search, keep notes in the Roadmap
in chapter 27. Recording your strengths and strategies is a logical and
results-oriented way to navigate the minefields of a job search and brain-
storm some unconventional approaches. It also will help keep your net-
working activities focused.

Blue/Red Introverts
YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Blue, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Red personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Introvert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being alone rather than being with oth-
ers. Much, but not all, of this material will focus on human and emotional
subjects, which your Color finds irritating. You will be more open to this if
you are in the second half of your life but will need it more if you are
younger. But since you respond to new ideas, the aim will be to surprise you
with our accuracy.
You Overall
Did the previous paragraph surprise you? Okay, let’s see what else we can say
to rock your highly logical world. After all, you are open minded. Mental
stimulation is as necessary to you as breathing. Color Q is a new derivative of
a decades-old, tried-and-true system of personality profiling. It goes back to
concepts proposed by Carl Jung. There are a lot of perspectives in here for you
to debate, so get a friend to read this chapter with you and go at it from all
angles. You’re good at that.
Your group of friends is small but intimate. Few see your real feelings.
Emotional stuff is usually last on your list, but many of your friendships are
formed over shared projects. Privacy is important, though, because when
CHAPTER 18

PA R T  4  |  B L U E S
concentrating on something, you find interruptions irritating. So just view
reading this as a new project on which you’ve decided to risk twenty
minutes (or fewer; it’s likely you skim or read fast).
New projects draw you like a magnet, often propelling you to the cutting
edge of your field. Independent, resourceful, and a skeptic at heart, you are
unafraid to take controversial positions.
It’s necessary for you to have flexibility to critique, redesign, and improve;
whether others understand or agree with your changes is irrelevant. You are
confident of your ability to improvise your way through difficult problems
that you doubt others even understand. Project follow-through, however, is
of low interest.
Your unusual insights make you, at times, almost psychic about future
trends, so people count on you for the most innovative systems and solutions.
In your interest areas, you communicate with speed and enthusiasm; other-
wise, you may not communicate at all. 
People see you as clever, critical, challenging, and sometimes disorganized.
You are most irritated by people who refuse to consider new ideas, who are
overly emotional, or who apply faulty logic.
CASE STUDY ONE
Entrepreneur, Small Business Expert
Jack Rubinstein “views the world at 50,000 feet” and aspires to view it at
60,000. He is chairman of the board of credit card processing company
Pipeline Data and general partner of DICA Partners, an investment hedge
fund. For fifteen years, he has been an advisor to small public entities through
his company Capital Market Advisory Network. He employs his ability to see
three years out to mold small firms into multibillion-dollar entities.
“My function,” says Jack, “is to create alternate solutions for people who
are too involved in the day-to-day nitty-gritty.”
Jack’s father owned a small business, and Jack remembers discussing the
day’s problems with him at the dinner table when he was eight years old. When
Jack began his career, he trained as a research analyst. “It’s a curiosity, ana-
lyzing businesses of all sorts,” Jack says.
Jack helps business owners navigate the capital markets and finds inno-
vative ways to help them expand. “I was an advisor to a $20 million company,
showing them how to ‘creep the market’ making thirty-seven different acqui-
sitions over a twenty-four-month period,” Jack recalls. “Then they were sold
to GE Capital for over $1 billion.

Jack has the Blue/Red Introvert’s vision for small companies that can
become large. He delegates all his detail work and record keeping to a Gold
family member.
You on the Job
AS A LEADER
High quality is the cornerstone of your leadership. Whether it applies to the
new ideas you propose, the people you hire to implement them, or the work
standards you set, high quality is always the theme. To meet standards, you’ll
even challenge conventional wisdom or push your people to develop them-
selves intellectually. 
Flexible and quick to adapt to change, you will be the first to see and solve
problems. Understanding global issues is your real talent. 
AS A TEAM PLAYER
Asking imaginative questions, generating many unique solutions, and
accepting the good contributions of others are characteristics for which you
are valued. 
You may not be valued for pointing out every flaw or inconsistency or for
indulging in overly intellectual or complicated descriptions.

H Focus intensely for long periods
Here are some Blue/Red Introverts in action in very different fields.
CASE STUDY TWO
Medical Research Scientist and University Professor
The resume of Bruce I. Terman, Ph.D., is replete with long lists of medical
research experience, grants awarded, and papers published. Behind the cre-
dentials is actually a likable guy (not unusual for those with a Red backup)
who cares about doing the right thing.
Between the classes he teaches as associate professor of the
medicine/cardiology division and associate professor of pathology at the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, New York, Bruce strives to
be a good citizen at his university. Along with his main work in research, “I try
to serve on administrative committees and participate in teaching and
research seminars,” he says.
As an Introvert, he especially enjoys the activities he performs on his own.
Of his three top natural strengths, he does two of them alone. “I’m best at per-
forming experiments and planning the scientific direction of the laboratory,”
he says. His third strength is teaching. He is energized by successfully obtain-
ing grants, getting his papers published, and having his laboratory experiments
produce expected or interesting results. 
Another aspect of his job that well suits his Introvert side is obtaining fund-
ing to support his research. He applies for numerous grants. He also must
keep abreast of his field by constantly reading scientific literature and attend-
ing national meetings of his peers (the latter he says is one of his least inter-
esting duties). In the laboratory, he supervises the research activities of five
individuals (a task that includes training of students and mentoring of other
scientists). Typical of a Blue who chooses a scientific career, he is persistent
about achieving his goals.
Bruce’s three biggest stressors are “supervising or interacting with nonco-
operative, nonproductive, or obnoxious individuals; waiting to hear about or
having grants and manuscripts rejected; and getting poor experimental results.”

That doesn’t happen often. In 1994, he was named the winner of the
American Cyanamid Scientific Achievement Award. Bruce is straightforward
about his successes. “I am smart and honest,” he says, a very typical
Blue/Red combination. Then it’s back into the lab to continue his life’s work. 
CASE STUDY THREE
Hedge Fund Manager, Investment Industry
Ari Levy is well on his way to recognizing and developing his unique Blue/Red
Introvert strengths. He is the founder, president, and chief investment officer
of Chicago-based Lakeview Investment Group. Additionally, he functions as
portfolio manager of the firm’s limited partnership, Lakeview Fund, a long-
short equity product focused on long-term investments in small- and micro-
cap-value securities. 
True to his Blue/Red nature, he prefers the portfolio management and
research functions over marketing and governmental compliance demands.
“There is nothing more satisfying than doing thorough research on a stock
and finding some inefficiency that makes it undervalued before Wall Street
discovers it,” Ari says.
Ari finds marketing less interesting, especially when “I don’t find the
person that I’m marketing to particularly interesting, or he or she doesn’t
understand what we do,” he admits. This is typical of Blue/Red Introverts.
He prides himself on his understanding of financial risk and reward and his
management skills. Blue/Red Introverts are deeply disciplined in their areas
of interest. Ari is very disciplined in the portfolio-management process,
“although I am not as organized in certain areas of my personal life!”
Ari is a typical Blue/Red Introvert in other ways. He enjoys probability-based
activities like gambling, investments, and card playing. His enjoyment of cutting-
edge activities is indulged every day at his hedge fund, forever trying to perfect
investment models. Even at leisure, his interest lies in sports statistics.
Ideal Work Environment
Jack Rubinstein’s ability is to think innovatively about business is supported
by a flexible environment. He also has the administrative support he needs to
stay focused on what he does best. Ari Levy, too, has created his own firm and
sets his own agenda. 

When a job offer is made, leverage as much as you can from the list in
figure 18–2.
FIGURE 18–2 The Ideal Blue/Red Introvert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. If these
descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve tested your individual Color
correctly. Other Colors, especially Golds, would find this environment
uncomfortable and unproductive. The optimal Blue/Red Introvert work envi-
ronment:
H Is flexible with a minimum of rules, procedures, and meetings. Nothing
should impede the intellectual process.
H Values independent and creative thinking. You look at a problem as if it
were a Rubik’s cube—from all sides. Then you rearrange it until a solu-
tion becomes evident.
H Focuses on startup phase of projects. Implementation and administration
are left to the support staff in place for that purpose.
H Allows privacy and ability to work alone without too much time pressure.
You really hate interruptions and people breathing down your neck.
You’re much more productive without them.
H Is a nonemotional, logical culture that rewards competence and risk tak-
ing. Emotions take time and energy. You’d rather put those resources
into the risk taking and analysis. 
H Contains an informal network of scholarly, independent, and motivated
associates. You need to verbalize all sides of a problem and debate solu-
tions. That’s hard to do by yourself, or with less-competent coworkers.
The worst type of work culture for a Blue/Red Introvert is overly bureau-
cratic and controlled. Strict time management and required work-area
tidiness drive you to distraction. When coworkers are emotionally sensitive,
or less competent than you, it stresses you to the limits of your patience.
When Blue/Red Introverts work in nonideal corporate cultures, productiv-
ity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.

The Introverted Blue/Red’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Blue/Reds get along especially
well with other Blues. But bosses of other Color types who possess the char-
acteristics in figure 18–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 18–3 The Blue/Red Introvert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Permits complete autonomy
H Treats employees as equals
H Is smart, quick witted, and stimulating
H Shields you from the organization’s bureaucracy
H Does not saddle you with administrative work
H Is open to improving existing systems and procedures
H Asks you to come up with ideas, then has others implement them
H Recognizes and respects your expertise
H Lets you have a say in how you are evaluated and compensated
Careers That Attract Blue/Red Introverts
You, like Bruce Terman, are most attracted to careers that require intellectual
energy, original ideas, and achievement. You prefer involvement with theoret-
ical problems and new technologies. Original projects are a must; routine and
repeated tasks are sorely taxing.
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals
to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color style characteristics that create suc-
cess in that broad area. 
According to our research, jobs italicized in the lists below are predicted to
benefit from an above-average growth rate over the next several years. This

CASE STUDY FOUR
When a Career Isn’t Working
Gretchen Kinderhook’s father was a property manager for a large Midwestern
office building. As a teenager, Gretchen used to join her dad after school to
help out. She became fascinated anticipating the problems of the tenants
and being ready to solve them as they arose. She also enjoyed the charged
atmosphere when a tenant crisis arose. She thought her dad had the best job
in the world.
When Gretchen was in her junior year at college studying business, her
father died unexpectedly. With little life insurance in place, the family’s secu-
rity was threatened. Using all her secondary Red crisis-management skills,
Gretchen dropped out and took over his job.
It was just as she had remembered it, and most of the tenants knew her by
her first name. What Gretchen had not anticipated were the tasks her father
had performed: They were so structured and stifling. Her Blue/Red Introvert’s
ability to see far into the future and strategize got little use as she dealt with
C H A P T E R  1 8  |
B L U E / R E D  I N T R O V E R T S
181

getting the trash out, the leases renewed, the vendors contracted, the
security staff hired, and the cleaning crew to show up.
Gretchen felt trapped by her obligation to help support her family. Dutifully,
she went around to the tenants to renew leases. On the eighteenth floor was
a small think tank with fifteen employees whose job was to predict market
trends for their blue-chip clients. Gretchen lingered here, throwing out so
many free ideas that the company president joked he would start paying her
as well as the rent. Gretchen’s heart leapt at the idea, surprising her. But she
didn’t think he was serious and did not feel she could let her family down.
Two years of valuable free ideas later, Gretchen actually accepted a gen-
uine job offer from the think tank. The salary was substantially higher than
what she made managing the property and would allow her to help her family
even more. The choice was a no-brainer, and today the new property
manager frequently comes up to the eighteenth floor to take Gretchen to
lunch when he has a problem. Her job at the think tank puts her right in her
strategic-thinking element, and she has completed her degree online.
Your Personality’s Challenges
Blue/Red Introverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some listed below you have, others you don’t. No one has them all. Tone
down a blind spot by focusing on it, then choose more productive actions and
make them habits. (Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q Can be too casual about deadlines and/or commitments when lost in
intellectual projects. (Set aside time in the morning when you focus on
such things; then you can concentrate on more important things.)
Q May initiate too many projects that cannot be completed. (So much
interest, so little time. Give yourself permission to work on more than
two major projects only if you have adequate staff on projects three
and up, and your role is to oversee.)
Q Intimidate those less quick witted. (Admit it, you like the power your
braininess gives you over your less-blessed colleagues. Just don’t make
a habit of humiliating them—one of them could eventually become
your boss.)
182
PA R T  4  |  B L U E S

Q Can be overly critical, complex, and competitive. (The competitive
drive is necessary in your preferred fields, but know where to draw the
line. Same goes for critical and opinionated behavior. Pick your battles.)
Q Change plans and strategies too frequently. (Changing course with
each new fact can be overwhelming for other Colors and subordinates.
Admit that you’re not an expert implementer. Show respect for and
cooperate with those who are.)
Q When fatigued, you become bitingly sarcastic and have uncontrolled
emotional outbursts. (Apologize and say, “I think it’s time for a break.”
Don’t talk to anyone until you’re in a better frame of mind; you’ll save
allies this way.) 
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Abundant creative ideas for pursuing your job search come easily to you. You
think it unlikely we’ll have anything new or useful in such a generalized
book. But aren’t job searches about improvising your way through a series of
difficult problems? To improvise, you need background material and strategy.
Thus, your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q See future trends and incorporate them into a career plan
Q Find unusual ways of getting interviews
Q Impress interviewers with your insights and competence
Q Logically evaluate the future of different job opportunities
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Pay attention to details
Q Express more enthusiasm during interviews instead of just trying to
wow the interview intellectually (which may backfire)
Q Create a job-search plan and stay with it as much as possible
Q Reign in your tendency to act smug with an interviewer you judge less
intellectually competent than you
Q Express appreciation to those who have helped you through thank-you
notes, follow-up calls

The Blue/Red Introvert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style, use the suggestions in parentheses. 
In following your natural style you:
Q Summarize and identify root causes. (A job interview may be too early
for critiquing how an organization works. Preface such remarks with
the phrase, “As an outsider looking in . . .” That way, you are excused
from knowing the political implications of your opinions.)
Q Avoid personal chitchat. (While you downplay its importance, chitchat
is meaningful to other Colors looking to see if you are compatible
within the corporate culture. Practice beforehand with a willing Green;
to identify, read chapter 4, “Greens Overall”).
Q Talk about insights and unusual approaches. (Your ideas flow like
water. But beware the competitor who has “recruited” you out of the
blue. He or she may only want to know what you know, and there’s no
job to be had at the end of it. Your ideas often are worth thousands of
dollars; allude to them, but get a real paycheck before sharing details.)
Q Frequently debate the pros and cons of various options. (A job offer is
on the table. Now’s the time to know the difference between debate
and negotiation. Role play negotiation techniques with a willing Red—
to identify, read chapter 9, “Reds Overall,” which will also outline
more of your own secondary strengths. You’ll see the difference and
understand debating is impolitic.)
Use this book to learn how to leverage your own strengths with those of
other Colors. Select a few colleagues whose skills you’d like to make better
use of. Read chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other
Styles,” to recognize their Colors, or ask them to take the self assessment.
Study figure 1 in each “Overall” Color chapter, and experiment with a few
new approaches. Do it scientifically; see if they work.
If you are actively job hunting, keep notes in the Roadmap in chapter 27.
It will keep your strengths in front of you for encouragement and help you
cultivate that elusive rapport-building function.

A Successful Gold: Joan Shapiro Green
Focus and organization were never issues for Joan Shapiro Green. For ten
years, she was president and CEO of BT Brokerage, a subsidiary of Bankers
Trust, trading stocks and bonds for institutional clients. During that decade,
revenues increased sevenfold. Apart from leading the staff to achieve the com-
pany’s objectives, what Joan enjoyed most was acquiring new clients and
meeting with them to solve their problems. 
Today she uses her well-developed Gold managerial abilities to support the
Central Park Group registered hedge funds, the Financial Women’s
Association, and the American Red Cross in Greater New York. While col-
leagues frequently poke fun at her calendar—a sweep of multicolored sticky
notes that regulate a complicated life—none dispute her passion or the Gold
drive to consistently deliver superior performance. Joan describes her top
C H A P T E R  1 9  |

187

strength as motivating and inspiring teams to accomplish their goals. Serving
on boards enables her to apply her energy and enthusiasm for important and
valuable organizations.
Joan is able to identify key issues and bring others on board to solve them.
These are all hallmarks of the Gold personality. Golds pay attention to details
and hold themselves accountable for results. You are the most solid of all per-
sonality types, thriving on having many responsibilities for which you are rec-
ognized and appreciated. You typically are no-frills types who are loyal and
procedurally oriented. While demanding top productivity from others, you
expect no less from yourself. 
Golds make up 46 percent of the world’s population, are the largest of the
four Color groups, and are the most grounded. You are the backbones of cor-
porate and public institutions. Society’s administrators, you are naturally tal-
ented at protecting others and directing the logistics of people, goods,
schedules, and services. You value detail and procedures, are known for your
follow-through ability, and can mobilize others to achieve well-defined goals.
Golds shine when establishing policy and aim for status, respect, and power.
“Let’s do it right” is typical of the Gold mentality.
Beauty Queen, Business Owner, and Philanthropist
From an early age, Monica Lakhmana had something extra going for her, and
it wasn’t just her exceptional looks. She had a drive to make the world around
her a better, and more beautiful, place.
“I became Miss India when I was twenty years old and went on to represent
my country at the Miss Asia Pacific Pageant in the Philippines,” she says. “It
was a wonderful experience to be an ambassador of your country, attend char-
ity functions, and visit different cities. To this day, I am still friends with some
of the contestants.”
The beauty of her jasmine-scented childhood home in Jamshedpur inspired
an interest in design and fashion. After earning an honors degree in English lit-
erature from Stella Maris College, Madras University, India, she began working
as a magazine journalist. In 1991, she was selected as a Rotary scholar for an
exchange program that brought her to the United States for a year. Upon her
return, she joined the Indian Hotels Company Ltd. (Taj Group of Hotels). “At
age 34, I received a National Award for Hotel Operations,” she says. “I have
impacted over seventy-five hotels through my operational expertise.” Monica
was director of operations at the Taj Group for twenty-three years.
188
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

She has attended management programs at the Indian Institute of
Management in Bangalore, the University of Michigan, and Cornell University,
to name a few. “I have always valued education and knowledge,” she says.
“For me, learning never ends; the more you interact with a diverse lot of peo-
ple, the more you learn.”
In 2013, she decided to put her personal values into action. “I started the
not-for-profit Monica Lakhmana Foundation for empowering rural Indian
women through economic opportunity,” she says.
Monica left the Taj Group in 2016 to form her own eponymous design
company based in Mumbai, India, specializing in fashion and interior design.
Her fashion company creates ready-to-wear couture, shoes, handbags, and
accessories under the brand promise Carry Elegance. This creates work
opportunities for the women served by her foundation. “I am inspired by the
colors, fabrics, embroidery that create beautiful accessories for women. My
handbags are colorful and quirky, and through them I hope to tell a story
about India and the women who create them.” Her interior design division
concentrates on hotel interiors, restaurants, and residence designs. 
“Networking and meeting interesting people are most engaging,” Extrovert
Monica says. “I attend several women-related conferences and workshops. I am
invited as speaker and panelist at diversity events, forums, and investment events,
and I have launched my own forum, Women’s Leadership Network World.”
Monica has been profiled by leading publications in India. She sits on sev-
eral boards, including the Indian Crafts Village Trust and the advisory board
of the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. 
A typical Gold, she identifies some of her strengths as “professionalism,
commitment, dependability, accountability, holding on to friends forever, and
a principled approach to life and honesty.” Golds are often self-described per-
fectionists; Monica is no exception. “Going into too many details at times
slows me down,” she says. 
Her Blue side wants to sit in the Indian Parliament one day and speak at
the United Nations on gender-equality issues. “I hope to leave a legacy behind
of good work,” she says.
Author and Playwright Betsy Howie
Plays and novels flow out of Betsy Howie; in true Gold fashion, she keeps
them all well organized. “I have seventeen binders of unpublished and unpro-
duced work,” she says. “I have another shelf for the things that have gotten
out there successfully.”
C H A P T E R  1 9  |
G O L D S  O V E R A L L
189

But her Gold do-it-right nature holds her to high standards. “It takes focus,
energy, and determination to complete a project,” she says. “I hate seeing it
on my to-do list. But I do love the rush of completion.”
Betsy’s involvement with the arts began as a child; she had two years of act-
ing in summer stock before she graduated from high school. After graduating
from college in three years, her goal was to be an actress. She did many com-
mercials for companies like American Express, Clorox, Microsoft,
Monster.com, and Wendy’s.
Her involvement with theater expanded into writing. Her best-known pro-
duction, the musical Cowgirls, spent only three years working its way up
through regional theaters to become an off-Broadway hit in 1996. “Most
musicals spend ten years before they make it to New York,” Betsy explains.
“But we fast tracked it.”
During Cowgirls, Betsy met the publisher of Harcourt Brace & Company.
This gave her the entrée she needed to publish her first novel, Snow, in
1998, inspired by Betsy’s successful fight against a cancer diagnosis in her
younger years.
To even out cash flow, Betsy went to work for Scholastic Reading Club in
1996. She has spent the last twenty years contributing blog posts, writing chil-
dren’s books (under a pseudonym), and running contests for Scholastic’s book
club division, where her Gold administrative talents get a regular workout.
Betsy’s daughter, Calpurnia (“Callie”), was born in 2001, bringing fresh
artistic inspiration for her Gold mother. “I wrote Callie’s Tally, tracking how
much my daughter cost me in the first year of her life,” says Betsy. Picked up
by Penguin/Putnam in 2002, its subtitle, An Accounting of Baby’s First Year (or:
What My Daughter Owes Me), boosted sales and even brought her to the atten-
tion of the producers of The Oprah Winfrey Show. “I never expected the con-
troversy it generated,” Betsy says.
For the next decade, with the daily help of her mother, she raised her
daughter in a small Connecticut town. The death of Betsy’s mother in 2011
brought profound changes to her life, including far less time and emotional
space to write.
“But now I’m turning the page,” she says. “Callie is a young, talented tap
dancer, and we’re moving back to New York City to give her the greatest pos-
sible opportunities.”
This move may do the same thing for Betsy. “I feel like all my dreams are
still unfulfilled,” she says, not realizing how much she has truly accomplished.

Sometimes Golds’ very high standards make them forget past laurels as they
pursue even greater ones.
Golds will be skeptical reading a book like this, preferring instead to deal
with things more concrete and less abstract. However, if you are interested in
learning how to work more effectively and efficiently with other personality
types, this book will be a key that unlocks the secret to motivating even the
most unfocused and disorganized people in your life. It will show you what
to do when all your best efforts have failed. 
The best way to proceed with this book is to read about your own primary
and secondary Colors first, then learn how you interact with others by
reading their profiles as needed. 
Famous Golds in politics are President George H. W. Bush and his wife,
Barbara; President Harry Truman; President George Washington; and Britain’s
Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth. Former chairman of IBM Thomas
Watson Jr., Sam Walton, and J. C. Penney represent Golds in the corporate
world. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar illustrates the Gold style in sports; Colin Powell
in the military; Warren Buffett in finance; Natalie Portman, Jimmy Stewart,
Martha Stewart, and Taylor Swift in entertainment; Sandra Day O’Connor and
Sonia Sotomayor in law; and Barbara Walters in journalism. Kate Middleton,
the commoner who has seldom made a misstep in her advancement into the
circles of British royalty, is also a Gold.
This chapter should help you determine if you’ve tested your primary and
backup personality Colors correctly. You now have tools for identifying Golds
among the people you know. Chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid:
Adjusting to Other Styles,” gives additional tips for Color coding others, as do
the other “Overall” Color chapters.

YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Gold, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Blue personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Extrovert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being with people rather than being
alone. Your Color group values efficiency, tradition, accuracy, predictability,
and structure. Achieving goals on time and under budget is a strong inner
drive in you. 
You Overall
In your community, you are a pillar: indispensable, well respected, and firmly
represented in important volunteer positions. You are realistic, grounded, and
responsible, getting things done no matter how difficult. This does not make
you stodgy, though; the hallmarks of your Color are boldness and drive.
Reinventing the wheel is not your style. Working on real as opposed to
intangible things and going with your own experience instead of new theories
are your usual choices. You value “the system” and prefer to organize life
around procedures and contract agreements. 
Your inner need for control makes it virtually inevitable that you will
hold responsible positions during your career; administrative skills are sec-
ond nature to you. Creating security and stability for family and coworkers
is a priority.
Gold/Blue Extroverts
CHAPTER 20

Once in charge, you relish mapping out what needs to be done. Task
assignments make best use of each staff member’s strengths. Woe to those
who fall short of your expectations: You show little sympathy for the ineffec-
tive and inefficient. 
With a direct and clear communication style, you are gifted at implement-
ing policies and ensuring things remain orderly and on track. Planning ahead,
setting goals, and controlling schedules are activities that come naturally.
Highly observant of details, you let little fall between the cracks.
You are not shy about criticizing those who break rules, dress flamboyantly,
or behave in unusual ways. What you see as appropriate, right, or wrong
comes from a place of deep moral certitude. Traditional and conservative
ways keep the universe organized and orderly, and you cannot understand
why anyone would ever want to disturb that. People who are disloyal, unre-
liable, or disorganized, or who miss deadlines irritate you.
You don’t just celebrate but honor rituals, traditions, holidays, birthdays,
and religious or cultural events. To you, these are symbols of continuity to be
passed on to the next generation, and they require appropriate fanfare. Family
is your central focus.

President of the $10 billion Chicago-based investment firm Ariel Investments,
she is also a regular financial contributor for CBS News. Vanity Fair and Time
magazine have both written features on her.1 In 2015, Mellody was named to
Time’s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Mellody is
chairman of the board for DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc., as well as a
director of Estée Lauder Companies, Inc., and Starbucks Corporation. She
also is charismatic, personable, and an admitted “fashionista.”
Gold/Blue Extroverts are driven to succeed from an early age. Mellody was
no exception. At age five, she set herself the goal of attending an Ivy League
university. By fifth grade she was staying up into the early morning hours
doing homework. “Slow and steady wins the race” became her mantra, and
at Ariel Investments she frequently wears a whimsical little turtle symbol
incorporated into her otherwise classic dress style. The firm shares this
theme for its highly recognized branding. “Slow and steady” also was how
C H A P T E R  2 0  |

she rose to become president of Ariel Investments fourteen years after she
started there as a college intern.
In typical Gold/Blue Extrovert fashion, Mellody lists her top three strengths
as communication, organization, and energy. “I’m very decisive. Waffling and
indifference drive me crazy.”
Mellody’s family background was not privileged. She grew up with five sib-
lings and was the first to graduate from college. She does not know how she
came by the drive to achieve all that she has. But Gold/Blue Extroverts have
an innate need for control, which impels them to acquire responsible
positions. They also value security and stability, things Mellody did not have
as a child. “I hated not having money,” she says of her formative years. “I
hated the insecurity of being evicted. The great thing about money is freedom;
you have choice. That’s all I ever cared about. . . . I’m going to work until I die.”
Mellody also says, “You really have to stay diligent about your values and
beliefs and not compromise.” Some of her deepest values are reflected in her
work to educate young black children and their families about the investing
process. To this end, her firm created and funded Ariel Community Academy
in Chicago. Here, the first-grade class is given $20,000 to invest; by eighth
grade the kids control the whole amount. Upon graduation, they return their
initial $20,000 to the incoming first-graders and distribute their profits to char-
ities and academic scholarships. Mellody’s stated goal is to make investing
into dinner table conversation among black families. A top priority of Golds is
to render community service.
In December 2004, Senator Bill Bradley told Time magazine, “Mellody has a
deep set of values about what’s right and what’s wrong.”2 She definitely puts
this into practice on a daily basis. This is a core Gold/Blue characteristic.
You on the Job
AS A LEADER
Getting the right things to the right people, in the right amounts, to the right
place at the right time—that is the crux of your talent. Outstanding logistical
skills are the hallmark of Gold/Blue Extroverts in leadership roles. With a
clearly defined chain of command and well-defined expectations and duties
for the staff, you can achieve anything. Those who play by the rules and per-
form up to your exacting standards are rewarded in fair measure. 
Like Mellody Hobson, you are decisive, providing for your organization’s
practical needs in a reliable and consistent manner. Getting to the core of a
194
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

situation quickly, managing fairly, providing consistent feedback, and crafting
clear and measurable goals are your tools for getting things done.
AS A TEAM PLAYER
Your positive attributes as a team member are many: defining problems
quickly; clarifying issues, obstacles, and goals; bringing logic to the table; pre-
venting important details from falling through the cracks; ensuring needed
resources are available; acting as a reality check about feasibility and costs. No
team functions at its peak without a Gold/Blue Extrovert. 
You are able to make the tough decisions when needed. However, you may
irritate team members by taking charge without being asked or being too blunt. 
Look at figure 20–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 20–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Are predictable and stable
H Are decisive
H Expect and have high work standards
H Use resources efficiently
H Respect rules and established procedures
H Get results through good time and task management
H Imbue confidence in your people or coworkers
H Finish projects on time and on budget
Now see how other Gold/Blue Extroverts use these strengths in very dif-
ferent fields.
CASE STUDY TWO
Fitness Business Owner and Novelist
Max Calder has spent almost thirty years improving life for hundreds of
others. But before he did, he had to learn how to improve his own. His Gold
C H A P T E R  2 0  |

195

196
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S
strengths of passion, enthusiasm, competence, confidence, and knowledge
have made him a successful owner of a growing Pennsylvania business.
Some of his best successes came early. “Athletic achievements,” he says.
“I was a competitive triathlete.” Then several sports injuries benched him. “I
shattered my right ankle,” he says. “They told me I would never run again. I
also endured a fully torn tendon in my shoulder.” 
He followed his doctors’ orders exactly but found himself becoming less
and less active. This did not sit well with him, and his Blue secondary per-
sonality started strategizing. “Doctors are very good at what they do, but
they only prescribe certain things,” Max says. “I decided to see what more I
could do for myself.” He started stretching to maximize his remaining flexibil-
ity, then added a strengthening regimen to restore his muscles gradually.
When he began to see results from both, he worked on creating a balance
between the two.
“It took a lot of rehab,” Max says, “but not only did I run again, I’ve now run
in over 100 races and countless track events. And although surgery was sug-
gested for my shoulder, I rehabbed it back to 90 percent mobility with just
stretching and strengthening.”
His fellow athletes took notice, and he started showing them how to be
safely active even with pain or injury. Eventually this led to formal training in
fitness science and nutrition, and a career as a personal fitness trainer. Today,
Max is the owner and manager of one of Anytime Fitness’s 3,200 locations
worldwide. He is planning to add two more centers shortly to his current loca-
tion in Villanova, Pennsylvania.
Golds are the world’s top administrators; half of Max’s time is devoted to
bringing in new business, sustaining current projects, designing and imple-
menting fitness programs, and, most recently, learning how to delegate effec-
tively. “I need help with the computer skills needed to conduct gym business,”
he says. In typical Gold fashion, he adds, “I experience impatience and lack
of tolerance for people who are not fulfilling their responsibilities.”
To recharge, Max enjoys the artistic pursuit of writing. He has written a
coming-of-age novel, Brotherly Love, under the name Peter Maxwell Calder,
which he self-published through XLibris in 2005. “I love to write fiction, and
wish I had more time to do so,” he says. But being a disciplined Gold, most of
his time still goes to developing new revenue streams, improving his leader-
ship skills, and mentoring other trainers.

CASE STUDY THREE
Literary Agent
New York City–based literary agent Linda Konner is a woman who knows
what she wants and gets it. “For me, it means not having a boss, not working
in an office/corporate environment, and choosing the people with whom I
wish to work,” she says.
Linda defines her principal functions as finding suitable publishers for her
clients’ books (mainly adult practical nonfiction), negotiating their contracts,
editing clients’ book proposals and sample chapters, troubleshooting with
and providing information to clients and publishers, helping clients find
cowriters and publicists if needed, and brainstorming ideas for future books.
These draw on her true-to-form Gold/Blue Extrovert strengths of editing, cre-
ating ideas, negotiating, problem solving, and networking.
She has always gravitated to what most recognize as glamorous careers.
Previously, Linda was a successful author of eight books, including Just the
Weigh You Are: How to Be Fit and Healthy Whatever Your Size (Houghton
Mifflin), The Last Ten Pounds (Barnes & Noble), and Your Perfect Weight
(Rodale). She also served as editor in chief of Weight Watchers Magazine and
features editor at Redbook, Seventeen Magazine, and Woman’s World. 
Her columns have appeared in Glamour and Fitness magazines and her
articles in the New York Times, Woman’s Day, the Boston Globe, the Christian
Science Monitor, and Playboy, among others. She has been in the publishing
field for over thirty years.
A natural editor, Linda is precise in her words. When asked for her top three
strengths, her Gold desire to answer precisely shows: “Do you mean things
like intelligence, creativity, sense of humor? Or writing, editing, and problem
solving? Take your pick! They all apply.” The most energizing for Linda are
brainstorming ideas, editing, and negotiating, true to her Gold/Blue core.
Her Extroverted and Blue sides enjoyed the success and media attention
she received as an author. Her Gold side comes into play in editorial positions.
“I love editing, and I’m good at it,” she says simply. 
She is a precise, thorough, and assertive negotiator, bringing all aspects of
her personality Color to the table in her current job. She recently celebrated
her twentieth anniversary as a literary agent, no mean feat in an industry that
inspires more burnout than longevity. Linda Konner illustrates how working
through, instead of against, your Color optimizes career success. 

Ideal Work Environment
A stable and well-respected institution with a predictable future is where
Gold/Blue Extroverts like Mellody Hobson feel most at home. 
When a job offer is made, leverage as much as you can from the list in
figure 20–2.
FIGURE 20–2 The Ideal Gold/Blue Extrovert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. Don’t be
deceived if these descriptions seem obvious. It confirms you’ve tested your
individual color correctly. Other Colors, especially Greens and Reds, would
find this environment uncomfortable and unproductive. The optimal Gold/Blue
Extrovert work environment:
H Is a stable and well-respected institution with a predictable future. You
work hard and want to be rewarded with money and respect. Small,
growing companies or distressed companies can’t offer this. You are the
quintessential corporate worker.
H Provides job security. Life change is a slow process for you; having it
forced upon you is harder on you than other Colors.
H Involves concrete and practical projects and products. Intangible serv-
ices are tough for you to quantify and measure. Stick with the things you
can touch and see.
H Has clear rules and expectations. Valuable time is wasted making up
rules as you go along. You don’t want to be bothered by this.
H Is organized and efficient. You cannot respect or work effectively within
a company that isn’t.
H Includes hardworking coworkers who pride themselves on doing things
right. You see crises and emotionalism as unnecessary weakness, even
slacking, on the part of others.
H Allows you to work within a group or team. You need people to organize.
H Rewards those who are steady, accountable, and focused on results.
Others may have time for drama and politics; you’re the one who gets
things done.
198
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

H Offers progressively higher levels of responsibility. A clear career path
gives you focus and helps you concentrate on the tasks at hand.
A corporate culture integrating the above elements is fertile soil for your
career advancement.
The worst type of work culture for a Gold/Blue Extrovert is loose and dis-
organized. It does not allow you access to reliable and critical information.
Constant change and ambiguity diminish your great administrative and orga-
nizational strengths. You need facts, bottom-line costs, and rules in order to
feel comfortable at work. 
When Gold/Blue Extroverts work in less-ideal corporate cultures, produc-
tivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Extroverted Gold/Blue’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Gold/Blues get along especially
well with other Golds. But bosses of other Color types who possess the char-
acteristics in figure 20–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 20–3 The Gold/Blue Extrovert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Always knows and clearly states what needs to be done
H Reliably provides needed resources
H Has clout with superiors
H Will confront workers who don’t deliver on commitments
H Gives more responsibility and perks when you’ve earned them
Careers That Attract Gold/Blue Extroverts
Gold/Blue Extroverts like Linda Konner cluster in fields that provide profes-
sional respect, require high levels of competence, and contribute in a mean-
ingful way to society. You need the ability to create predictability and stability
to be at your best.
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals

to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color style characteristics that create suc-
cess in that broad area. 
According to our research, jobs italicized in the lists below are predicted to

CASE STUDY FOUR
When a Career Isn’t Working
Three of eight students were crying—loudly—and a fourth was starting.
Early childhood development teacher Jeanine Beckwith could see no
earthly reason for the outburst—but started to feel like joining in. She had
hoped her second year would be easier than her first, but it all seemed to be
going downhill.
All Jeanine’s female relatives had been teachers, and she was proud when
they applauded her on graduation day. Her celebration afterward had made
her feel so important, so much a part of a long family tradition. Now she was
on her own in a sea of slobbering three-year-olds, trying to maintain order. 
What she didn’t want to admit was that kids drove her nuts. From the time
she started babysitting at age 12, she always felt awkward trying to follow
their nonlinear thinking, being sensitive to their changing needs. As a teacher,
there was no way to maintain order, everyone’s learning happened at different
levels, and nothing about her day was ever predictable. Jeanine was at wit’s
end; such an environment will drive any Gold/Blue Extrovert crazy.
Confiding in her aunt, Jeanine explored how to use her education degree
to find a job more organized and predictable. Her aunt suggested that Jeanine
apply for an assistant principal position in a nearby town. Jeanine was
ecstatic when she got the job. Being in charge, in control, and with the ability
to manage and organize was very satisfying to her Gold/Blue Extroverted
nature. She is in line for the principal’s job in a few years and well respected
by her peers. Life is under control again.
Your Personality’s Challenges
Gold/Blue Extroverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some listed below you have, others you don’t. No one has them all. Tone
down a blind spot by focusing on it, then choose more productive actions and
make them habits. (Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q May prematurely dismiss new ideas. (Dismiss nothing until you inves-
tigate the who, what, where, when, why, and cost of a new idea.
Profitable ventures start with untested ideas; learn how to allow others
to brainstorm and present their conclusions to you.)
202
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

Q May focus on the flaws in the efforts of others and not give credit
where credit is due. (Make a point of affirming the efforts of deserving
colleagues after listing flaws.)
Q Are fixed in supporting established ways of doing things. (The tried-
and-true contribute to efficiency, but they may not keep your company
alive when the market is moving or changing. When faced with
change, focus on details and costs—your areas of strength.)
Q Push through your own ideas by being verbally aggressive. (Getting
things done well requires buy-in, not submission. Study the art of per-
suasion, since you already have a natural talent for the art of ruling.
Read about how to persuade other Colors in figure 1 of each Color’s
“Overall” chapter.)
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Gold/Blue Extroverts create accurate and well-presented resumes that elicit
positive responses. With some interviewers, particularly Golds and Blues, you
will feel a comfortable rapport. But with those of other Colors, you need to
prepare and rehearse responses outside your comfort zone. Many human
resources people are Greens; make a study of how to communicate effectively
with this Color group before your first interviews.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Have a wide network of friends for job leads
Q Set measurable, realistic, and well-defined goals
Q Create time lines, daily status reports, and budgets that reduce job-
search stress on you and your family
Q Adequately research prospective employers
Q Be well prepared for interviews
Q Come across as hardworking and bottom-line oriented in an interview
Q Logically consider pros and cons of job offers
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Balance networking with research
C H A P T E R  2 0  |
G O L D / B L U E  E X T R O V E R T S
203

Q Do something in return for those who help you; your networking
sometimes comes off as too self-serving
Q Cushion your tendency to be abrupt; rehearse some areas of small talk
Q Prepare to talk about yourself on a personal level (ask a willing Green
to role play with you)
Q Think about a prospective company’s future direction (ask a willing
Blue to help)
Q Be willing to consider career opportunities in other industries
Q Don’t allow unexpected delays and obstacles to frustrate you
Q Plan a “think-through day” when tempted to jump on a job offer
The Gold/Blue Extrovert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style (and it’s statistically likely that many will have a Green compo-
nent), use the suggestions in parentheses. Mercilessly exploit these natural
abilities of yours and get more job offers.
In following your natural style, you: 
Q Describe past accomplishments in appropriate detail. (A Green inter-
viewer may draw you out with questions like, “Did you enjoy those
duties?” Be prepared with answers more thorough than “Yes.”)
Q Tend to talk too much and not ask enough questions about the job. (If
it has been a while since the interviewer said anything, pause. Let him
or her lead. Prepare a list of job questions ahead of time and refer to it.)
Q Focus on the present. (Especially if interviewing for a senior-level
position, you will need to prepare for questions on future planning.
Take a Blue colleague to lunch and run a few ideas by him or her
before an interview. At least read public statements about company
direction prior to an interview.)
Q May not think outside the box. (Your orderly mind knows what your
next career step should be but tends to close off other possibilities.
New fields, or even established ones you haven’t considered, may allow
you to ascend higher and faster than your planned career path.)
204
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

Take a break now to do something administratively important. Later, check
out chapter 14, “Blues Overall.” Then carefully read chapter 24, “Before I Do
Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other Styles,” to learn about the strengths of
other Colors. 
Like all Colors, you need the strengths of others, and you can put them to
work for you if you know where to look and how to ask. If you invest time
learning how to recognize the Colors who can best assist you (visit figure 1
in each of the “Overall” Color chapters), it will make everyone more effective
and productive. 
If you are actively engaging in a job search, jot notes in the Roadmap in
chapter 27. Recording your strengths and strategies is a concrete and results-
oriented way to navigate the minefields of a job search.

YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Gold, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Blue personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Introvert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being alone rather than being with peo-
ple. You are most happy when things are orderly, efficient, and predictable.
Because of your innate talent at it, you have a strong drive toward managing. 
You Overall
A pillar of whatever organization or community you join, you are thorough,
responsible, and hardworking. Your unusually accurate memory records
what others say and do with astonishing precision. While thoughtful, you
can overlook such formal niceties as thank-you notes or praise for jobs well
done by others. 
Realistic and practical, you take your commitments seriously. You value
“the system” of whatever organization you are in, trust contracts, and
organize your life and work around procedures. Your children and coworkers
all feel secure and stable under your watch—that is, if they measure up to
your high standards. You can be the classic Type A personality, demanding
much of others at home and work. But those demands are never made capri-
ciously; you think things through and always are cautious about changes. 
Gold/Blue Introverts
CHAPTER 21

With your highly developed administrative skills, duty-bound work ethic,
and great ability to concentrate, you float to top-level positions wherever you
invest your efforts. Fierce loyalty to your company cements your status.
When undertaking a task, you bring to it logic, impersonal analysis, com-
mon sense, and practical experience. You gravitate to situations where you
have to plan ahead, set goals, and control the schedule. You are gifted at
implementing well-defined policies and ensuring that things remain orderly
and on track. Because doing a good job is your primary focus, you expect to
be judged and compensated on your own merits. You are fair and consistent
when dealing with others.
Family is your central focus. You honor traditions and rituals, observing
holidays, birthdays, and religious and cultural events with appropriate
fanfare. For you, these times are important symbols of continuity to be passed
on to the next generation. Gold/Blue Introverts often trace their roots and
record the family heritage for their progeny.
Appropriateness is your watchword. Your strong morals lead you to judge
others and speak up if they seem to blur right and wrong. You simply want the
world to stay organized, free from the chaos that follows when rules are broken.
Even flamboyant dress and unconventional behavior try your tolerance.
CASE STUDY ONE
University President
Dr. Kathleen Waldron is president of William Paterson University in Wayne,
New Jersey. The public university serves over 11,000 students and is a resi-
dential suburban campus. Kathleen moves effortlessly between her many
constituencies: students, faculty, staff, alumni, donors, and public officials.
She is a natural and graceful leader with superior management skills.
A Fulbright scholar who received her doctorate in Latin American history
in 1977, she had a thirteen-year career at Citibank, capped by her turn as pres-
ident of Citibank International in Miami from 1991–1996. She then spent six years
as dean of the School of Business at Long Island University and five years as
president of Baruch College before joining William Paterson University in 2010.
She has achieved success by leveraging, rather than working against, her
Introverted nature. For instance, others describe her as a great listener. “I am
a fairly private person who can read three books a week. Now that is very hard
to do with all the evening entertainment and events that take away my private
time,” she reflects. “But I knew that going in.” While quite reserved in her early
C H A P T E R  2 1  |
G O L D / B L U E  I N T R O V E R T S
207

208
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S
years, today her people skills are superior. “It’s been a long process,” she says,
“to develop a comfort level for public speaking, of going forward to people with
my hand outstretched, taking the initiative to do that. That was hard.”
Fund-raising is a substantial part of her job, one where her banking back-
ground and Gold/Blue strengths are useful. When she sits down to solicit cor-
porate leaders, “they know I am a business person who sets goals, measures
accomplishments, and is a serious manager. They feel more comfortable that
their donations are going to be properly utilized.” Kathleen stresses to them
and her staff the importance of “accountability, stewardship, and reporting
back to people.” She is known for expressing her opinions with tact. All these
are prime Gold/Blue values.
She is also very involved with instituting proper instruments for educational
evaluation. This typical Gold/Blue interest in results and accountability helps
her nearly 1,000 faculty members institute assessment models that work
within their particular disciplines. “Getting a job is such a narrow definition of
a successful education,” says Kathleen. “I changed the dialogue to broaden
those evaluation measures to instill in students analytical capabilities, com-
munications skills, and a broader sense of life including art and music.”
She also has a typical Gold/Blue approach to organizing her work. “I have
all my systems in place; I am very structured in getting to my goals. I keep very
careful agendas, crosschecked to be certain things are on schedule. I know
exactly where I’m going to be a year from now.”
Early in her career, Kathleen was a natural analytical problem solver. Now,
her feeling/intuitive side is coming into play. “I believe that leadership is
people developing people. What gets me excited is to watch people do better
than they have.” Kathleen exhibits most of the key characteristics of her Color
style, especially in her aptitude for taking the helm and running a smooth ship.
You on the Job
AS A LEADER 
Getting the right things to the right people, in the right amounts, to the right
place at the right time—that is the crux of your talent. Outstanding logistical
skills are the hallmark of Gold/Blue Introverts in leadership roles. With a clear
chain of command and well-defined expectations and duties for the staff, you
can achieve anything. Those who play by the rules and live up to your
exacting standards are rewarded in fair measure. 

You see your role as reliably providing for your organization’s practical
needs. You are accurate, decisive, and know how to get things done. 
Your decision-making style is to absorb and assess as many facts as
possible. Then you measure the cost of each possible solution before choosing
the optimal one.
AS A TEAM PLAYER
Your positive contributions are many. Getting to the core of problems quickly;
clarifying issues, obstacles, and goals; bringing logic to the table; preventing
important details from falling through the cracks; ensuring needed resources
are available; acting as a reality check about costs—no team functions opti-
mally without a Gold/Blue Introvert as one of its members. 
You feel responsible and loyal to your teammates. You know how
important your contributions are, and you work hard not to let others down.
However, you may irritate team members by not sharing information until too
late in the process and/or being rigid about how things should be done. 
Look at figure 21–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 21–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Adapt naturally to the role assigned to you, be it leader or follower
H Are accurate about all parts of a task
H Create and enforce policies, procedures, and schedules that keep
everyone effective and on track
H Are fair with others and earn their respect
H Are decisive, organized, and get things done

Now see how some Gold/Blue Introverts use these strengths in very differ-
ent fields.

CASE STUDY TWO 
Investment and Real Estate Advisor  
Sergio I. de Araujo has the classic Gold/Blue Introvert resume, with clear cor-
porate loyalty and few career changes. This satisfies a Gold’s need for conti-
nuity, tradition, and stability. Prior to his retirement, he had been with U.S. Trust
Company for twenty years. His final position there was managing director and
senior investment officer for the Southeast region until he retired in 2008.
But later in life, one’s primary personality traits soften; there is exploration
of other Colors’ neighborhoods. Sergio’s resume since retirement looks like
that of an active twenty-year-old. He dabbled briefly with his son, Andrew, in
running a long-only fund investing in Brazil. “I have subsequently established
a relationship with Evercore Wealth Management, a part of Evercore Partners
in New York,” he says. “A year ago, I obtained a Florida real estate license
and associated myself with K-2 Realty, a successful, relatively young firm with
a strong presence in north Palm Beach County and Palm Beach Island.”
In his work with Evercore, Sergio’s sales and relationship skills are put to
use introducing prospects to the organization and may have a continuing
support role in advising and maintaining the relationship. Golds follow estab-
lished policies to the letter, an important characteristic in financial services.
Client relationship initiatives such as wealth advice, planning, and relation-
ship reviews are some of Sergio’s strengths, drawing on his attention to detail
and organizational skills. He put these to good use when he helped found
Citigroup’s international private banking division in 1971; he spent the first half
of his career there before aligning with U.S. Trust. Early on, Sergio realized
how to make himself indispensable in an industry where there were always
younger, brighter, better-educated, and less highly paid managers waiting to
step into one’s shoes. “I enjoy working with clients,” he says, “and soon real-
ized they are the anchor of one’s career.” Where others might compete in the
ability to provide strong investment performance, keep up with technological
and professional advances, or implement compliance initiatives, Sergio found
there was no substitute for superior client service.
Sergio brings the same client relations capabilities to his new endeavors
at Evercore and K-2 Realty. “These two activities are proving to be most
enjoyable and also keep me engaged,” he says. Perhaps this Gold is now
beginning another twenty years in a third, long-term, stable career. 

CASE STUDY THREE
Chemical Engineer, Manufacturing Company Owner
In Germany, all little Martin Deeg wanted to do was play in the dirt. His family
had different ideas. “I grew up with parents who were both technically
trained,” says Martin. “It was an environment that discouraged anything
other than being a scientist; an engineer was marginal, but nevertheless
acceptable.” His family moved to the United States in the 1960s when his
father took a job as director of materials research at American Optical
Corporation in Southbridge, Massachusetts.
Martin’s adolescent rebellion led to a college major in archeology. “I would
have loved to have been an archeologist. I like digging in the dirt.” But
parental expectations prevailed. After studying chemical engineering in col-
lege, Martin worked in product development for Celanese Corporation. He
began as a process development engineer and ultimately attained the
position of staff scientist. He holds more than ten patents in the fields of high-
performance composite materials and PET/PBT melt spinning.
Martin branched out when he joined Scott Paper Company. Starting there
as technology manager, Martin eventually expanded into director of business
development–worldwide and concentrated on the marketing side. Following
Scott Paper’s merger with Kimberly Clark, he was given the title senior
research fellow.
In 1999, he established and became president of Icarus West, Inc., a niche
business manufacturer handling supplies for the polysilicon industry. “We
make very clean, very pure, very expensive, extremely specialized polyethyl-
ene gloves,” he says. Martin is involved in all parts of the business, handling
all customer contact. “We have no competition,” he says. Other companies
“have not been able to meet the same kind of quality standards.” No doubt his
Gold/Blue process skills keep those standards high.
Being company president has its down side, however. “Bookkeeping, deal-
ing with suppliers . . . taxes are downright stressful!” he says. “But probably
the most stressful thing is dealing with ongoing requests to decrease price. I
hate negotiating—I like things black and white, nice and straightforward.”
Martin doesn’t define what he’s doing now as success. “I’ll have success
once I retire. The definition of success for me is being able to wake up in the
morning and feel good about whatever it is I’m going to do for the day.” To
accomplish this, Martin plans to go back to his roots. “Doing relatively basic

clearing, constructing, excavating . . . something outside, pushing dirt
around, seems to be potentially a fun thing to do . . . it justifies buying big
mechanical toys.”
Ideal Work Environment
For both Kathleen Waldron and Sergio de Araujo, a stable and well-respected
institution with a predictable future is their chosen environment; Martin Deeg
owns his own business and frequently works at home. 
When a job offer is made, leverage as much as you can from the list in
figure 21–2.
FIGURE 21–2 The Ideal Gold/Blue Introvert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. If these
descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve tested your individual color
correctly. Other Colors, especially Greens and Reds, would find this environ-
ment uncomfortable and unproductive. The optimal Gold/Blue Introvert work
environment:
H Has clear rules and expectations. It wastes valuable time trying to make
up rules as you go along. You don’t want to be bothered by this.
H Includes hardworking coworkers who pride themselves on doing things
right. It’s much easier when everyone is on the same page about how to
get things done. You see crises and emotionalism as unnecessary weak-
ness, even slacking, on the part of others.
H Is a stable and well-respected institution with a predictable future. You
work hard and want to be rewarded with money and respect. Small,
growing companies or distressed companies can’t offer this. You are a
quintessential corporate worker.
H Rewards dependability and precision. You’re on time, have a well-planned
schedule, and do your job with consistency. No company runs well for
long without a Gold/Blue Introvert on staff. You deserve recognition.
H Involves concrete and practical projects and products. Intangible serv-
ices are tough for you to quantify and measure. Stick with the things you
can touch and see.

H Is results oriented. You are frankly a bit skeptical of any work that can’t
be evaluated with a spreadsheet.
H Has a clear hierarchy. Structure gives you comfort and frees you to con-
centrate on the task at hand.
H Values loyalty and commitment. These are a deep and natural part of the
core of who you are. In today’s workplace, they are less valued. Now you
are better off choosing to place your loyalty with a mentor rather than a
company.
H Allows for private space. As an Introvert, your batteries get drained
when dealing with people, even if your people skills are superb. If you
have to share your work space with others, you will feel a lot more
fatigue at the end of the day. You think and perform better in a private
space where you can reflect in-depth on projects; insist on one as a
condition of employment if possible.
A corporate culture integrating the above elements is fertile soil for your
career advancement.
The worst type of work culture for a Gold/Blue Introvert is loose and open
ended with regard to goals and measures of success. “You’re only as good as
your last (fill in the blank)” describes a work environment that would make
you tear out your hair. 
You also hate working with people who take things too personally. You
want to stay focused on the task; emotional situations are cloudy and distract-
ing. Never work for a company that values intuition over hard data. You need
facts, bottom-line costs, and rules in order to feel comfortable at work. 
When Gold/Blue Introverts work in nonideal corporate cultures, produc-
tivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Introverted Gold/Blue’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Gold/Blues get along especially
well with other Golds. But bosses of other Color types who possess the char-
acteristics in figure 21–3 also can be good mentors.

Careers That Attract Gold/Blue Introverts
Like Sergio de Araujo, you want to find a place to call home, where you
can work comfortably for many years under the guidance of clear rules, pro-
cedures, and expectations. You require predictability and stability to be at
your best. You are happiest upon reaching a high level of responsibility, like
Kathleen Waldron, in a culture where there’s a clear chain of command. Like
Martin Deeg, you particularly need to be rewarded for your abilities to be
accurate and get things done.
Please note that not all the following careers will appeal to you, but recog-
nize that each, in some way, draws on the strengths of your style and appeals
to a significant number of your Color group. This is not a comprehensive list,
but it will show underlying patterns of preference. If unlisted careers offer
similar patterns, your chances of success increase. Text in parentheses at the
end of each section highlights the Color style characteristics that create suc-
cess in that broad area. 
According to our research, jobs italicized in the lists below are predicted to
benefit from an above-average growth rate over the next several years. This
information is based on the continuously revised data provided by the U.S.

CASE STUDY FOUR 
When a Career Isn’t Working
Brad Gunter was fed up, and the good money he was making wasn’t enough
compensation for the daily aggravations. Worse yet, he felt trapped. His
uncle, Phil, who was a partner in a major Los Angeles advertising firm, had
gotten him this high-paying job as an account executive. Brad desperately
wanted to quit, but he could not let the family down. 
Even weaving his way through L.A. traffic in his new Porsche Carrera
wasn’t cheering him up as it once had. The day had been especially grueling
when it should have been triumphant. Brad had just landed a major airline
account. Today, it seemed as if his private office had been stormed by every-
one in the firm. The creative department wanted ideas and brainstorming,
which Brad hated. The back office needed lots of hand-holding as it estab-
lished an account larger than any it had ever seen. Brad was assigned to
three new teams, and working on teams was something he dreaded. All he
had wanted to do was sift through demographic information about potential
airline customers and memo the right people. Instead, his reference materials
had gone untouched all day, and Brad was suffering from the serious
Introvert’s overexposure to people.
Finally, a pleasant thought entered his crowded mind: Michelle, the lovely
young woman he had just met. They had had a wonderful lunch conversation
several days ago about her work as a real estate appraiser. Convinced at first
that he would be bored out of his skull, Brad had been surprised by how inter-
ested he was in Michelle’s work. The factual data gathering, the comparisons
216
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

to similar properties, the long hours alone with papers to be interpreted—
right now, Michelle’s job seemed like heaven to Brad. It certainly was a job for
which Gold/Blue Introvert Brad felt well suited.
Fast forward two years. Brad finally found the courage to give up his
stressful account executive position despite family opposition. Using the
money he made from his commissions (which ran well into six figures), Brad
supported himself while studying to become a real estate appraiser. When
Brad married Michelle, she quit her job so the two of them could form their
own appraisal firm. Energized daily, Brad loves his new career and is about to
hire several people. 
Your Personality’s Challenges
Gold/Blue Introverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some listed below you have, others you don’t. No one has them all. Tone
down a blind spot by focusing on it, then choose more productive actions and
make them habits. (Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q May prematurely dismiss new ideas. (Dismiss nothing until you know
the who, what, where, when, why, and cost of a new idea.)
Q May focus too much on the flaws in the efforts of others and not give
credit where credit is due. (Make a discipline of giving some sort of
affirmation to a colleague after listing flaws. Acknowledge those who
deserve it; say when the flaws are outweighed by the good work.)
Q Stress immediate results and overlook long-range implications. (Invest
some time in long-range planning and get more comfortable with it as
a tool. Ask a willing Blue to help.)
Q Are fixed in supporting established ways of doing things. (The tried-
and-true contribute much to efficiency. But they won’t keep your com-
pany alive when the market is moving or changing. Also, established
ways can be improved. Focus on the who, what, where, when, why,
and cost of changing a procedure so you can take some of the credit.)
Q Are rigid about how others should perform their responsibilities. (This
book reveals the strengths of other Colors, strengths you may be lack-
ing. Results are the priority, not necessarily the efficiencies of getting
C H A P T E R  2 1  |
G O L D / B L U E  I N T R O V E R T S
217

there. Grant the wisdom of others some benefit of the doubt while
awaiting proven results. If their way proves better than yours, you
don’t want to look stupid.)
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Gold/Blue Introverts need to process information. With some interviewers,
particularly Golds and Blues, you will feel a comfortable rapport. But with
other Colors, you need to prepare and rehearse responses outside your com-
fort zone. Many human resources people are Greens; study how to communi-
cate effectively with this Color group before your first interviews.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Set realistic goals and time lines
Q Adequately research prospective employees
Q Be well prepared for interviews and come across as hardworking and
competent
Q Logically consider pros and cons of every offer
Q Be patient with delays and obstacles
Q Show confidence in your ability to deal with bottom-line issues
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Go beyond your friends to expand your networking circle
Q Prepare questions to ask interviewers
Q Do some brainstorming with a willing Blue or Green to consider alter-
native careers
Q Be more assertive about selling yourself
Q Do some thinking about a prospective company’s future direction (ask
a willing Blue to help)
Q Resist the urge to be overly cautious about change
Q Step back to reflect for a day or two about a job’s impact on you and
your family when tempted to make a snap decision
218
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

The Gold/Blue Introvert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style (and it’s statistically likely that many will have a Green compo-
nent), use the suggestions in parentheses. 
In following your natural style, you:
Q Are calm and composed. (This can look like disinterest—most inter-
viewers expect a certain amount of nervousness. Make sure to speak
more than you normally do, especially at first.)
Q Document your experience well, in an easy-to-follow manner.
Q Prefer written communications before face-to-face meetings. (Practice
interview questions before the meeting. This will boost your confidence.)
Q Share few feelings with people. (A Green interviewer relies on his or
her emotional response to you as a big part of the decision-making
process. If your interviewer asks you questions like, “How did you
get along with previous coworkers?” he or she may be Green.
Prioritize building a personal rapport with such an interviewer by
answering emotion-based questions at length. Role play with a
willing Green.) 
Q Focus on the present. (Especially if interviewing for a senior-level
position, you will need to prepare a position on future planning. Take
a Blue colleague to lunch and run a few ideas by him or her before an
interview. At least research public statements about the company’s
future direction prior to an interview.)
Q Follow through with all details; respect deadlines and commitments.
(Interviewers respect that you send requested items, call to follow up,
show up on time, and send thank-you notes.)
Okay, go do something purposeful now. Later, check out chapter 14, “Blues
Overall,” then carefully read chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid:
Adjusting to Other Styles,” to learn about the strengths of other Colors. Like
all Colors, you need the strengths of others. You can put them to work for you
if you know where to look and how to ask. If you invest time learning how to
recognize the Colors who can best assist you, it will make everyone more
C H A P T E R  2 1  |
G O L D / B L U E  I N T R O V E R T S
219

effective and productive. You can do this by quickly reading the Blue, Red,
and Green “Overall” chapters. 
If you are actively engaging in a job search, jot notes in the Roadmap in
chapter 27. Recording your strengths and strategies is a concrete and results-
oriented way to navigate the minefields of a job search.
220
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

Gold/Green Extroverts
YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Gold, you also have strong secondary characteristics of
the Green personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Extrovert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being with people rather than being
alone. Your Color group values efficiency, accuracy, predictability, tradition, and
social responsibility. Affirming others is a strong inner drive. These core tenden-
cies should ring true with you, since they’ve been researched worldwide for well
over half a century. (If not, return to your self assessment and follow the direc-
tions for reevaluating yourself.) It’s important that you read the exact right pro-
file, since you can significantly enhance your professional and personal
relationships as well as your job search with the information that follows.
You Overall
Ensuring the welfare of those around you, whether family or colleagues, is the
focus of your energy and has been since you were a child. You affirm others
and put them at ease. People in your Color group have continuous curiosity
about people and keen observational skills. 
Testing new ideas makes you uncomfortable; you favor working with real
things and sticking with what you’ve experienced. Since few details escape
your notice, you may feel you’ve “seen it all.” Preferring the here and now,
you shun change and minimize future thinking.
CHAPTER 22

One of your best qualities is your highly developed work ethic.
Commitments and obligations are undertaken with utmost seriousness. Your
follow-through is unwavering, and you easily mobilize others when help is
needed. Strengths of your group include anticipating what needs to be done,
getting involved in details, and organizing resources and procedures. Along
the way you create harmony and stability, always aware of how you might
serve both people and goals. You are a consummate volunteer or service
career worker. 
Straightforward yet diplomatically is how you prefer to communicate with
others. The people who irritate you most are those who do not share your
personal warmth and work ethic: the discourteous, the unreliable, and the
unprepared.
Here’s how all these qualities combine in a real-life Gold/Green Extrovert.
CASE STUDY ONE
Corporate Event Planning Executive
Upon meeting Frankie Lucostic, the first impression is of a wiry, fun-loving,
gregarious man. He is a natural in his position as head of events, Americas,
for a line of business at a leading New York global financial services firm.
“The focus is on creating an experience and how to overwhelm with serv-
ice,” Frankie says. “That’s a natural for me.” He plans and executes events
start to finish, from initial strategy “to the really granular details when on-site.
That is really rewarding,” he says.
Event planners frequently are open to, and pursue, many different interests.
Frankie’s childhood dream was to become a plastic surgeon. But he majored
in government and minored in marketing with the goal of attending law
school. He was accepted, but decided it wasn’t for him. “I took my first job
based on company culture and my attachment to their work, and found an
events role by chance,” he explains. “Along the way I did stints in account
management, internal corporate communications, and recruiting, but always
came back to events,” he says. “I couldn’t keep away.”
His Green secondary personality and Extroversion are energized by
contact with clients, both internal and external. Becoming more strategic
about events (a natural for Blues) is a harder discipline for detail-focused
Golds. It took Frankie some time to learn how to manage outcomes. “Because
I’m in the business of details,” he says, “it can be hard for me to move on or
let things go.” But ensuring the welfare of attendees and coworkers is
222
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

C H A P T E R  2 2  |
G O L D / G R E E N  E X T R O V E R T S
223
Gold/Green Frankie’s focus. “As much as you plan, there’s always something
unexpected,” he says. “Keeps it fresh!” 
His Gold primary has propelled him upward into management and admin-
istration. “In my previous job, I progressed to being a lead, where I still
planned and executed but also managed a small team,” he says. “I was pro-
moted into a leadership role after that, taking on parts of the business/opera-
tions, and finally into head of the whole team. It ‘takes a village’ to do events,
so a strong team is a must.”
Frankie now leads a team of eight event professionals who produce over
200 live and regional events for over 100,000 senior executives. “These events
are much higher ‘touch,’” he says. A Gold/Green Extrovert’s strength is moti-
vating others to cooperate in achieving goals. 
Although this hardworking leader doesn’t plan to slow down anytime soon,
he does know that creating a healthier work/life balance will be part of his
future. But first, he says, “I always ask myself, in any role, what’s my legacy?”
Golds are very oriented to making a positive and lasting impact on the world.
With Frankie’s Extroverted talent for interacting with people and fostering
interaction among so many others, that will not be hard.
You on the Job
AS A LEADER 
Getting the right things to the right people, in the right amounts, to the right
place at the right time—that is the crux of your talent. Outstanding logistical
skills are the hallmark of Gold/Green Extroverts in leadership roles. Providing
clear guidelines and instructions, you build productive teams on which all are
kept well informed. 
You welcome responsibility as a tool for instituting sensible rules and pro-
cedures. You feel accountable for proper use of all resources and are vigilant
to prevent their misuse. 
You are suspicious of the agendas of those who question authority,
believing they are slackers or troublemakers. You are loyal and expect loyalty
in return. The personal attention you give your people gains you not only loy-
alty but also goodwill. 
AS A TEAM PLAYER
You encourage your teammates to share viewpoints and ideas. But when goals
have been set, you’re the one who provides clear and practical ideas to achieve

them. Getting things accomplished on time and on budget is the only accept-
able way. You keep the agreed agenda on track, keep progress records for
everyone, get the needed resources, and respect rules and procedures.
While other team members may not realize what resource they need until
they need it, you’ve already anticipated and supplied it. Your contribution to
the team is immense. However, you may irritate others by talking too much. If
nobody else has said anything for a while, solicit opinions. You also may ham-
per your efforts by sulking over disagreements you tend to take too personally.
Look at figure 22–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 22–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Have a strong need to be of service to others
H Acknowledge and respect the chain of command
H Can easily repeat and sequence tasks
H Deal well with details
H Apply common sense
H Motivate others to cooperate in achieving goals
H Stay with the job until it’s done
H Get things done on time and under budget
Here is another Gold/Green Extrovert using her strengths in a very
different way.
CASE STUDY TWO
Philanthropist, Historical Documents Preservationist
On many hot days of an earlier era, two little girls played in the gardens of the
Ibrahim Palace, an architectural jewel set on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt. One
was a Hungarian who had escaped her native land several years before; the
other was Princess Fazilé Ibrahim, a member of the Egyptian royal family and
great-granddaughter of the last Turkish sultan.
224
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

C H A P T E R  2 2  |
G O L D / G R E E N  E X T R O V E R T S
225
Then, on what is still known today as “Black Saturday,” political turmoil
struck. Thousands of religious fundamentalists, communists, and radical stu-
dents began gathering in the streets. Within twenty-four hours, many of the
symbols that had given Cairo its glamor had been burned down. Guests were
thrown out of their windows at the Shepherd Hotel. We could see the mobs
pulling people out of their cars and stoning them to death. It is a memory that
will remain forever, for this is the author’s story as well.
The two families fled rapidly—one going to the United States and the other
settling in France. It was thirty years before we met again.
Today Princess Fazilé is president of the Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt Fund, affil-
iated with the London-based Royal Asiatic Society. The organization is dedi-
cated to encouraging the development of Ottoman studies internationally by
publishing Ottoman documents and manuscripts of historical importance from
the classical period up to 1839. A true Extrovert, she is an active, hands-on
executive, traveling to elevate awareness of her fund’s mission and encourage
submission of manuscripts. “I was clear about the fact that I intended to
involve myself in all the proceedings in order to reach the precise goal of my
foundation,” she said. Her focus and determination are very much Gold/Green
characteristics. 
Making scholars familiar with the work of the fund is a not a quick process,
but Princess Fazilé continues the quest to find important Ottoman-era docu-
ments that will underpin historical research. “The fund is small, not well-
known for the present, and nothing compels people to come to us,” she says.
“We have to smile and encourage . . . and be patient.” She has traveled to
Turkey to meet with historians at two major universities and has visited the
Centre of Istanbul Archives.
When manuscripts of great historical importance do come to her notice,
“then it is a blessed moment for me, when I no longer question the validity of
my project,” she says. She finds these discoveries most energizing. Golds
have a reverence for history and its preservation.
The princess defines success as “doing something I care for and that
some other people care for, too.” When pushed about her strengths, she
reluctantly says, “Maybe I am very stubborn; the fact is that I never got any-
thing I wanted without giving a fierce fight.” She claims she is not a business-
woman, but these Gold/Green Extroverted characteristics serve her well.

A stable, organized institution with a predictable future is where Gold/Green
Extroverts feel most at home. When a job offer is made, leverage as much as
you can from the list in figure 22–2.

that ring true for you. If these descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve

nity. You gravitate to established organizations; startups don’t appeal to
you.
H Involves concrete and practical projects and products. Intangible serv-
ices are tough for you to quantify and measure. Stick with the things you
can touch and see.
H Has clear rules, reporting lines, and expectations. Valuable time is
wasted trying to make up rules as you go along. You don’t want to be
bothered by this.
H Allows you to work within a group or team. You need people to stay
energized.
H Contains trustworthy coworkers. You take an interest in the well-being
of colleagues and clients, and prefer that it’s reciprocated.
H Is service oriented. You are by nature service oriented and want to work
in a place that honors those values.
H Rewards reliable people. It’s rare that you fail to meet your deadlines.
H Provides financial security. You take pride in being competent and
expect to be compensated appropriately.
H Makes you feel like part of a big family. You thrive in collegial places.
226
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

H Allows you to factor in the needs of your family. Since you make sure
goals are achieved at work, you expect to be able to take time for signif-
icant family needs. 
A corporate culture integrating the above elements is fertile soil for your
career advancement.
The worst type of work culture for a Gold/Green Extrovert is impersonal
and highly competitive. Constant change makes you feel that your great
administrative and organizational strengths are valueless. You need rules, sta-
bility, and positive personal interactions in order to feel comfortable at work. 
When Extroverted Gold/Greens work in nonideal corporate cultures, pro-
ductivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Extroverted Gold/Green’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Gold/Greens get along espe-
cially well with other Golds. But bosses of other Color types who possess the
characteristics in figure 22–3 also can be good mentors.
FIGURE 22–3 The Gold/Green Extrovert’s Ideal Boss
Check off if your boss:
H Shows appropriate personal concern for each staff member
H States clearly what needs to be done
H Sets achievable goals
H Is reliable about providing needed resources
H Holds to firm completion dates
Careers That Attract Gold/Green Extroverts
Gold/Green Extroverts like Princess Fazilé Ibrahim and Frankie Lucostic
cluster in fields that provide professional respect, require high levels of com-
petence, and contribute in a meaningful way to society (especially in well-
known institutions). You need predictability and stability to be at your best.
Upon reaching a high level of responsibility, you assemble a competent and
loyal staff.

CASE STUDY THREE
Energy Efficiency Executive
Laura Van Wie McGrory is deeply immersed in providing for the world’s
energy needs. She is vice president, international policy, for the Alliance to
Save Energy, a nonprofit organization founded in 1977 by U.S. Senators
Charles Percy and Hubert Humphrey. This organization focuses on American
energy policy and improving global energy efficiency.

G O L D / G R E E N  E X T R O V E R T S
229

230
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S
Laura manages energy efficiency projects in Asia, Africa, southeastern
Europe, and Latin America. These include international energy productivity,
policy and regulatory reform, green building certification, building code imple-
mentation, utility demand-side management capacity building, financing
municipal efficiency programs, energy-efficient transportation efforts, and
water supply projects. Efficiency and social responsibility are two key drivers
for this Color group.
She came to her current position with an impressive resume, starting with
a master of international affairs degree focusing on international environmental
policy from Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. 
She began developing research reports for the World Bank, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change. She gained more international exposure as head of the Washington,
DC, office of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This brought her
into contact with the U.S. Department of Energy, where she helped draft rule
makings for U.S. energy efficiency appliance standards. She also provided
technical support to the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and
Climate and the Asia-Pacific Economic Corporation.
Her work appeals to her Green side. “Most engaging is finding synergies
and collaborating with policymakers from other countries,” she says. But
being a primary Gold, she focuses on facts rather than visions. “Some of my
best successes are combining information from many experts into a coherent
and useful report,” she says. “I don’t come with the big, new, breakthrough
ideas. I engage others, then follow through and make sure projects are
carried out properly and with high quality.”
But when offered a well-earned governmental dream job in Washington,
Laura turned it down. “The decision,” she recalls, “revolved around whether
we would move to this charming small town two hours from DC, or stay so I
could take the job. Then my son Ian asked me, ‘Will you be home after school?
I want to see you more!’” Laura chose the small town. “Life is a juggling act.”
Your Personality’s Challenges
Gold/Green Extroverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind
spots. Some listed below you have, others you don’t. No one has them all.
Tone down a blind spot by focusing on it, then choose more productive
actions and make them habits. (Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses
below.) You:

Q Get too involved with details, ignore the big picture. (Find a willing
Blue and lunch with that person twice a month. Occasionally emulate
his or her long-term strategic thinking so it’s a tool when you need it,
but it will never feel natural.)
Q Need significant praise and appreciation and get dispirited when there
is none. (Not all Colors verbalize appreciation. It’s there, but not evi-
dent. Either ask, “How am I doing?” or give yourself a pep talk. You
know how you’re doing, and you’re usually doing very well.)
Q Don’t handle competitive situations well. (When you cannot turn the
tide to cooperation, or calm things down, step back and disengage.
Refuse to play the game. Most of the time, this is the only way to
defuse the pressure.)
Q Tend to stick to what has worked in the past. (There are many paths to
the same place. All have their strengths and advantages. Yes, your way
is the right way—one of many. Ignore your discomfort once or twice a
year and examine the advantages of another way.)
Q Do not naturally see new possibilities. (If your experience isn’t
addressing a new situation well, you get discouraged and hopeless,
sometimes giving up. Get help—talk to someone, preferably a Blue or
Red, to see beyond the now. Resist insisting on procedures just for
their comfort value.)
Q Make up your mind too quickly. (Even if you receive new information,
it’s difficult for you to reverse a position. Often in life you have felt
stuck with a position not in your best interest in order to get
something done. Throw a cog in the machine when you feel the need
[especially if you have doubts about a marriage or having a child].
Believe it or not, it will be good for everyone.)
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Gold/Green Extroverts are better than most Colors at drumming up informa-
tional interviews and getting referrals to job leads. Your strengths and blind
spots below apply equally to both informational and formal interviews.
With some interviewers, particularly Golds and Greens, you will feel a
comfortable rapport. But with those of other Colors, you need to prepare and
rehearse responses outside your comfort zone. Many human resources people
C H A P T E R  2 2  |
G O L D / G R E E N  E X T R O V E R T S
231

are Greens; make a study of how to communicate effectively with this Color
group before your first interviews.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Have a clear action plan for your search and proceed in an orderly fashion
Q Have measurable, realistic, and well-defined goals and meet them
Q Be patient with job application rules and procedures
Q Have a wide network of friends and colleagues upon which to draw for
job leads
Q Adequately research a company before the interview
Q Follow through on details of a job search, like writing appropriate
thank-you notes
Q Create time lines, daily status reports, and budgets that reduce stress
on you and the family
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Balance networking and research
Q Be willing to consider less-obvious career opportunities and ways to
get interviews
Q Resist getting depressed and gloomy about turndowns; they’re not per-
sonal rejections
Q Plan a think-through session; reflect for a day or two about long-term
implications of a job for both you and your family before deciding
The Gold/Green Extrovert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style, use the suggestions in parentheses. Mercilessly exploit these
natural abilities of yours and get more job offers. 
In following your natural style, you: 
Q Have an accurate and well-presented resume. (Accurate may not mean
intriguing. Write descriptions that invite the interviewer to delve
deeper; ask a willing Green for assistance.)
232
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S

Q Focus on the present. (Especially if interviewing for a senior-level
position, you will need to prepare a position on future planning. Take
a Blue colleague to lunch and run a few ideas by him or her before an
interview. At least read public statements about company direction.)
Q Come across as stable, hardworking, warm, and with solid past accom-
plishments. (Good foot in the door, but not enough. Awareness of bot-
tom-line considerations is just as important. Adjust some of your
language to address cost management if applicable.)
Q Demonstrate enthusiasm for the job. (This becomes a negative if you
“gush.” Keep sentences short, body language under control, hand ges-
tures below the neck.)
Q May not think outside the box. (Your orderly mind knows what your
next career step should be but tends to close off other potentials. You
prefer established fields, but there are always those you haven’t consid-
ered that may allow you to move higher and faster than your planned
career path.)
Take a break now to socialize. Later, read chapter 4, “Greens Overall,”
then carefully read chapter 24, “Before I Do Something Stupid: Adjusting to
Other Styles,” to learn about the strengths of other Colors. In certain key
areas, you need their strengths. You can put them to work for you if you
know where to look and how to ask. If you invest the time, you’ll learn how
to recognize the Colors who can best assist you. This will make you more
effective and productive.
If you are actively engaging in a job search, jot notes in the Roadmap in
chapter 27. Recording your strengths and strategies is a concrete and results-
oriented way to navigate through the discouraging parts of a job search. It also
will help capture what you learn on informational interviews and remember
whom to thank when you land your new job.

YOU’RE NOT ONLY a Gold, you also have strong secondary characteristics
of the Green personality. And you have tested as a Color Q Introvert, which
means you recharge your batteries by being alone rather than being with peo-
ple. Your Color group has gentle and supportive people who value tradition
and have strong follow-through skills. It’s helpful to know your strengths so
you can maximize them and your weaknesses so you can delegate or ask for
help with them. Suggestions follow for all of this. 
You Overall
You are quiet and reflective, and the focus of your energy is to ensure the wel-
fare of those under your care. This core tendency surfaces early in your life.
Very few people get to see your rich inner world because you always are more
focused on the needs of others.
At work this translates to a highly developed work ethic where commit-
ments and obligations are undertaken with seriousness and given top priority.
A practical, detail-oriented, and thorough person, you can always see and
address what needs to be done at each phase of a project.
Your warmth, sense of responsibility, and desire to create stability and har-
mony lead you to service careers and volunteer activities. But you don’t last
Gold/Green Introverts
CHAPTER 23

long in hectic and ambiguous environments; stable organizations that provide
ample private time to plan will better support your ambitions.
Authority, history, and tradition are things you respect. So is the conserva-
tion of any kind of resource, natural or man-made. You find change, abstract
concepts, and untested theories irritating. When you start imagining things,
it’s usually worst-case scenarios that fill you with doom, gloom, and self-
doubt. Pulling yourself back to the real world makes you feel better, and you
prefer staying there. Imagination is not your friend, and the vivid imaginations
of Greens in particular make you uncomfortable.
If you have coworkers who are discourteous, unreliable, noisy, or unpre-
pared, it drives you crazy. Conflicts are problematic for you and avoided
wherever possible, allowing bad behaviors to continue unchecked.
At cocktail parties or business functions, you just enjoy blending in.
Controlling the attention or taking a dominant role isn’t something you want
or need. You leave the starring roles to others. One on one is the way you pre-
fer to communicate, and you listen attentively. Putting others at ease is a
talent you’ve acquired through your natural curiosity about people and your
keen powers of observation.
CASE STUDY ONE
Obstetrician/Gynecologist and Military Veteran
Gold/Greens make very reassuring obstetricians and gynecologists. They are
thorough, knowledgeable, and warmly personable. That describes Elizabeth
Lucal, M.D., FACOG.
“I felt obstetrics/gynecology has always been the right career path,”
Elizabeth says. “I feel that it chose me more than I chose it. My strengths are
being meticulous, detailed, persistent, and outspoken. I also think some of my
strengths are good degrees of compassion and empathy for other people’s
situations.”
The young girl who wanted to be a veterinarian became a young woman
who committed herself to four years of medical training at Michigan State
University, College of Human Medicine, and four years of OB/GYN residency
at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii. Today, Elizabeth is affiliated with
Health Quest Medical Practice seeing patients in their New York offices in
Fishkill and Poughkeepsie.
“The element that is most engaging is teaching,” she says. “First, I believe
in order to have physicians with good ethics, morals, and respectful patient

interactions, residents must be taught and provided with good examples of
this behavior. Second, teaching forces me to stay current with medical infor-
mation and standards. Third, I enjoy the interaction of teaching; and fourth, I
learn more than I teach in this role of faculty.”
Although she enjoys writing and dictating notes about her patients’
appointments, she does not enjoy the grind of updating the electronic medical
records. “Sadly, I cannot delegate this,” she says.
Elizabeth is proudest of her abilities to make the medical system accessible
to patients without money or insurance. She is also proud when she can pick
up on details missed by others. “Some of my best successes,” she recalls,
“have been early diagnosis of medical problems that were overlooked by
other providers.”
Elizabeth is a dedicated physician who has not taken a vacation in over
three years. “To recharge my batteries, I read, I run, I practice yoga,” she
says. And, typical of a Gold, “I try to spend a lot of time with my family.”
You on the Job
AS A LEADER 
Getting the right things to the right people, in the right amounts, to the right
place at the right time—that is the crux of your talent. Outstanding logistical
skills are the hallmark of Gold/Green Introverts in leadership roles. You
supply clearly defined guidelines and instructions for your staff, and you
often jump in and share the work. 
You see your role as providing for the organization’s practical needs, to
which you attend as if providing for a family. You welcome responsibility, feel
keenly accountable, and prevent misuse of key resources. Everyone is kept
informed, which reaps goodwill and productivity.
When making important decisions, you go step by step, avoiding all fore-
seeable risks. You absorb and assess as much factual information as possible
and are uncomfortable going with your gut.
AS A TEAM PLAYER
You rarely seek to lead but encourage others to express their ideas, provide pos-
itive feedback, and usually are modest about your own contributions. When a
team needs a practical reality check, you’re the one to provide it. Dependable
and reliable, you do thorough work, meet deadlines, respect rules and proce-
dures, and don’t understand the motivations of others who behave differently.

If you speak up about the less productive actions of team members and
they argue with you, you are apt to take it too personally. 
Look at figure 23–1 for a list of your natural work-related strengths.
FIGURE 23–1 Natural Work-Related Strengths
Approximately 80 percent of these attributes will apply to you. Check off those
that do, and use them in your resume and interviews. This will set you apart
from the canned responses of others. You:
H Can organize people to accomplish well-defined goals
H Observe the needs of others and supply them whenever you can
H Are practical about what needs to be done and how to do it
H Support and encourage others
H Work well on a team
H Are not ego driven
H Follow the rules
Now see how one Gold/Green Introvert uses these strengths in a different
field.
CASE STUDY TWO
Tax Lawyer
Those with a Green personality component switch careers more easily than other
personality types. Yours is a unique adaptability—you sense the lay of the land
almost immediately and are able to respond appropriately and creatively. Martha
Miller, a Gold/Green tax lawyer for forty-two years, is an excellent example. 
Martha was an economics major in college at a time when that was a dar-
ing choice for a woman. “I wanted to get an MBA, but in 1966, women weren’t
welcome in MBA programs. This made me mad, so I went to law school
instead. The only course I really did well in was tax law. When I graduated, I
was encouraged by the law firms to take a job as a secretary—at the time,
women made $7,500 a year as an attorney, $7,800 as a secretary. (Male attor-
neys made $13,800.) So I got mad again, and acted professionally for about
eight years, playing sadomasochist nuns and psychotic school teachers. To

237

238
PA R T  5  |  G O L D S
even out my income I worked for H&R Block, preparing taxes, teaching the tax
course, and managing offices. Between acting and Block, I always made
more money than I would have practicing law in a big firm.
“My performance career culminated as a tax and finance feature reporter
for two years for NBC News in New York. I got fired as part of a budget
shortfall, so I opened Miller Tax Law, LLC, in New York City. Later I moved to
Connecticut, taking my tax clients with me.”
Lawyer, tax preparer, actress, television news reporter—Martha’s Green
adaptability is perfectly balanced by her Gold primary personality in the tax-
law field. Her Gold side minds the details while her Green secondary handles
the long-term thinking and emotional hand-holding this job requires. “Many
people come to me in abject fear, totally absorbed by what they think is an
unsolvable tax problem,” Martha says. “Within an hour, I can usually convince
them that they are going to be all right. They often cry at the beginning of the
interview, whether man or woman. By the end, they are laughing and smiling.”
However, her Green side suffers under the filing and document-tracking
demands. “Giant piles of paper are the burden of any law office,” she says,
sighing.
Martha pursues physical activities during her free time, often working on
her stunning Victorian home in the foothills of the Berkshires. “Because my
work is so conceptual, I find I need to do physical work to effectively relax,”
she says.
Gold/Greens are more likely than most to fulfill their dreams rather than
put them on hold. Martha is no exception. “I don’t even have a bucket list,”
she says.
Ideal Work Environment 
You, like Dr. Elizabeth Lucal, gravitate to stable, recognized entities with solid
reputations in the community. When a job offer is made, leverage as much as
you can from the list in figure 23–2.
FIGURE 23–2 The Ideal Gold/Green Introvert 
Work Environment
Compare your current work environment to the descriptions below. If these
descriptions seem obvious, that confirms you’ve tested your individual color

correctly. Other Colors, especially Reds, would find this environment uncomfort-
able and unproductive. The optimal Gold/Green Introvert work environment:
H Is a stable and well-respected institution with a predictable future. You
work hard and want to be rewarded with money and respect. New or
distressed companies can’t offer this. You are a quintessential corporate
worker and you want to ally yourself with a firm that stands behind its
people and products.
H Involves concrete and practical projects and products. Intangible serv-
ices are tough for you to quantify and measure. Stick with the things you
can touch, see, and immediately evaluate.
H Is oriented to serving customers and staff. You have a deeply rooted
principle of serving others. If your company disregards that, you will not
work there long.
H Values and returns loyalty and commitment. These are a deep and natu-
ral part of the core of who you are. In today’s workplace, few companies
can afford to offer their employees the loyalty they once did. Today, you
are better off choosing to place your loyalty with a mentor rather than a
company; but there are still a few good firms around.
H Has a work/life balance program that respects the family needs of staff.
Family is your first priority, and you are too good a worker not to be
allowed time for family needs. 
H Is quiet, orderly, and calm. The one situation you are weakest at coping
with is chaos. 
H Allows for private space. As an Introvert, your batteries get drained
when dealing with people, even if your people skills are superb. You
recharge your batteries by being alone. If you have to share your work
space with others, you will feel a lot more fatigue at the end of the day.
You think and perform better in a private space where you can reflect in
depth on projects; insist on one as a condition of employment if possible.
A corporate culture integrating the above elements is fertile soil for your
career advancement.
The worst type of work culture for an Introverted Gold/Green is highly
competitive and rewards intuition over factual accuracy. Environments of
C H A P T E R  2 3  |

constant change, like startup or distressed companies, can stress you to the
point of physical illness. 
When Introverted Gold/Greens work in nonideal corporate cultures, pro-
ductivity is stunted and career achievements become an uphill climb.
The Introverted Gold/Green’s Ideal Boss
Even a great job can be frustrating under the wrong boss; a mediocre job
under a wonderful boss is pretty hard to leave. Gold/Greens get along espe-
cially well with other Golds. But bosses of other Color types who possess the
characteristics in figure 23–3 also can be good mentors.

H Is organized and sets clear objectives

H Provides needed resources
Careers That Attract Gold/Green Introverts
The company you’ll call home is one where you can work in a secure career
path for many years under the guidance of clear rules, procedures, and expec-
tations. Predictability and stability bring out your best work. You particularly
need to be rewarded for your abilities to be accurate and get things done, like
tax lawyer Martha Miller. Financially well-managed companies are what you
instinctively prefer.

When a Career Isn’t Working
Bertie Feldman learned a lot by doing his cousin Tom a favor. Tom decided to
run for state treasurer and asked Bertie to manage his campaign. Bertie was
deeply flattered; his cousin complimented him on his superior abilities to tune
in to people’s needs, handle details, and complete follow-through tasks.
“Bertie,” his cousin said, “no one is better at these things than you!”
It probably helped that Bertie recently had been laid off from his middle
management job with a big enough severance package to see him through
the four-month campaign. But Bertie also knew it wouldn’t just be his cousin
getting exposure. Introverted Bertie was determined to use the experience to
get his resume around and meet people with whom he would never otherwise
come into contact.
The cramped campaign quarters did not allow Bertie a private office. Over
time, this became a major fatigue factor, with volunteers dropping in to ask ques-
tions or talking too loudly on their phones. Gold/Green Bertie much preferred the

243
stability and predictability of his old job; by contrast, the campaign was uncom-
fortably fluid, with candidate plans changing constantly. Concrete-thinking
Bertie was at a loss during strategy sessions, when, as campaign manager, he
should have been leading the discussion. But strategies and theories stymied
Bertie’s factually oriented Gold/Green character.
He was great, however, at managing the volunteer staff. No task ever
lacked a competent person, and even the media noted how well his cousin’s
campaign was organized. Tom won the election, and Bertie knew what he
wanted to do and where.
Two weeks after the elections, Bertie was offered the job of his dreams:
managing the volunteer staff at the National Historical Museum two towns
away from his home. Half of his time would be spent doing research in a pri-
vate (hallelujah!) office. The salary was identical to the one at his old job, with
superior benefits. Bertie’s family was especially happy when he came home
revved up at the end of each day.
Your Personality’s Challenges
Gold/Green Introverts have a unique set of potential work-related blind spots.
Some listed below you have, others you don’t. No one has them all. Tone
down a blind spot by focusing on it, then choose more productive actions and
make them habits. (Suggestions for doing so are in parentheses below.) You:
Q Don’t see the forest for the trees. (Details, rather than the big picture, are
your preferred focus. Without an overview, your detail decisions may be
flawed. Keep in mind the end result and the details become clearer.)
Q Need approval and get dispirited if it’s not expressed. (Myth: If they don’t
express it, they don’t feel it. Fact: More than one Color feels appreciation
without expressing it. Sometimes, you just have to reward yourself.)
Q Overreact to competition and infighting. (When you can’t avoid con-
flict, you become cold, snappy, and overly negative. Be proactive; nip-
ping it in the bud will drain you less. You’ll beat competitors with your
tireless follow-through; don’t be afraid of them. They have something
to prove; you don’t.)
Q May be overly cautious about new ways. (Focus on whether the new
is practical; that’s your strength. Support pilot projects and trial
periods before saying no.)

Q Can be less assertive and direct than needed. (You prefer to blend in;
but occasionally you have to step up and share your knowledge. This is
what it takes sometimes to get the job done. Do it without reservation.) 
Your Job Search—the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Gold/Green Introverts have the advantage of being best one on one. With
some interviewers, particularly Golds and Greens, you will feel a comfortable
rapport. But with those of other Colors, you need to rehearse responses out-
side your comfort zone.
Your natural strengths easily allow you to:
Q Assemble a close and supportive network
Q Construct an accurate and compelling resume
Q Create a clear action plan
Q Have measurable and well-defined short- and long-term goals
Q Research and collect facts on prospective employers
Q Proceed through the interview process in an orderly way
Q Come across as hardworking, warm, and prepared
Q Be patient with what needs to be done and job application rules
Q Follow through on all details of the search and are decisive when the
right opportunity turns up
In order to tone down your blind spots, you need to:
Q Not take delays and obstacles as rejections
Q Prevent stress by organizing time lines, status reports, and a job-search
budget to track how well you are meeting your goals
Q Stretch yourself socially to broaden your network
Q Drill down to bottom-line implications and be tough when focusing on
that aspect of a job
Q Role play uncomfortable salary negotiations (get a willing Blue or Red
to assist)
Q Refuse to give in to depression after being turned down

The Gold/Green Introvert’s Interviewing Style
With an interviewer whose Color is close to your own, you will feel
immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer seems to have a significantly
different style, use the suggestions in parentheses.
In following your natural style, you:
Q Listen more than you speak. (This can look like disinterest. Make sure
to speak more than you normally do, especially at first.)
Q Prefer written communications before face-to-face meetings. (Read
several back issues of pertinent trade journals if necessary. Gather facts
from all sources: Internet, library, annual reports. Such preparation will
boost your confidence.) 
Q Prefer to talk about specific details, schedules, and deadlines. (A Green
interviewer relies on his or her emotional response to you as a big part
of the decision-making process. If your interviewer asks you questions
like, “How did you get along with previous coworkers?” he or she may
be Green. Prioritize building a personal rapport with such an inter-
viewer. Role play with a willing Green.) 
Q Focus on the present. (Especially if interviewing for a senior-level
position, you will need to prepare a position on future planning. Take
a Blue or Green colleague to lunch and run a few ideas by him or her
before an interview. At least read public statements about the company’s
future direction prior to an interview.)
Okay, go do something valuable to your community now. Later, check out
chapter 4, “Greens Overall,” then carefully read chapter 24, “Before I Do
Something Stupid: Adjusting to Other Styles,” to learn about the strengths of
other Colors. Like all Colors, you need the strengths of others. You can put
them to work for you if you know where to look and how to ask. If you invest
time learning how to recognize the Colors who can best assist you by reading
figure 1 in each of the “Overall” Color chapters, it will make everyone more
effective and productive. 
If you are actively engaging in a job search, jot notes in the Roadmap in
chapter 27. Recording your strengths and strategies is a concrete and results-
oriented way to assess the progress of your job search.

GETTING THE JOB
PART 6

PEOPLE LEAVE JOBS because they dislike other people more often than
because they dislike their tasks: “If it weren’t for my boss, I’d really love my
job.” “If Mary would just stay out of my hair, I’d be able to complete my proj-
ects on time.” Certain Color Q personalities clash with others because they
don’t recognize each other’s strengths. Believe it or not, your boss and your
coworker Mary can actually make your work easier if you learn their
strengths. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to do this using Color Q. Start by
identifying the Colors of others (see figure 1 in each of the “Overall” Color
chapters) and then determine what they can do for you. Finally, there are tips
on how to speak their languages.
Giving someone the self assessment in chapter 2 often is not feasible. So
here’s how to do Color Q detective work. Follow the steps in figure 24–1 to
assess someone else’s Color. (These tips work outside the office, too; for exam-
ple, on dates or when trying to improve relations with your spouse or parents.)
FIGURE 24–1 Assessing Someone Else’s Color
Figuring out someone’s Color is not easy. It takes time and close observation
to figure out someone’s full Color type. But if you can assess any part of their
Color makeup, it will go a long way toward improving communications.
Before I Do Something Stupid
Adjusting to Other Styles
CHAPTER 24

Everyone has a Gold or Red component, and a Blue or Green component.
In this section, we will concentrate on identifying these components. If you
can recognize these pieces, whether they are primary or backup, you’re
ahead of the game. In addition, everyone is either an Extrovert or an Introvert. 
There are three steps to revealing these components:
1. First, look at the person’s work space. Try to look at it in the morning, at
noon, and after they have gone home for the day. 
They’re a Gold if: The desk is usually uncluttered, has no piles, and
everything is neatly filed. Golds begin and end projects before starting
new ones. Other clues: Golds tend to be serious and formal and always
on time.
They’re a Red if: The desk is a mess of files, papers, and piles. Usually
everything is a work in progress. Other clues: Reds are loose and relaxed
(may even have their feet up on the desk) and often time pressured or late. 
2. The second piece of this detective work is the Blue/Green component.
Start a conversation and talk about any comfortable subject, but notice:
Green versus Blue: How much do they personalize the relationship with
you? Greens will, Blues won’t. 
They’re a Green if: There’s a lot of small talk, an effort to personalize the
relationship even if it is business focused, an effort to put you at ease.
They’re a Blue if: There is limited chitchat, a sense of distance, a desire
to keep the relationship on a professional basis; if they are brief and
terse, gets to the point, imparts a sense that they are appraising you.
3. Finally, everyone is either an Introvert or an Extrovert. Both may have
good people skills, but they express themselves in different ways. 
Extroverts are more talkative, speak in a louder voice, and gesticulate
more. They may even speak before thinking and later change their mind. 
Introverts listen more, tend to have more subdued energy, and gesticu-
late less. They think before answering and will rarely change their
minds. 
You can observe people’s style while they are speaking and adjust your
behavior accordingly. The benefit is that all will be more comfortable in your
presence and listen to what you have to say.

Once you have an idea about someone’s personality Color, you can begin
to change the tone of your interactions. Two things will happen: You will get
more help from your adversaries, and they will respect you more. You will
come to appreciate their strengths, too (perhaps to the point of even liking
them, a little).
Getting Along with the Other Colors at Work
Whether you are managing, selling to, motivating, or working with others,
Color Q helps hone your approach. Use the tips below to change the tone of
your communications with troublesome bosses and coworkers, and note the
results. If you’ve accurately assessed their primary Color, the effects will be
significant.
COMMUNICATING SMOOTHLY WITH GOLDS
When managing a Gold, give precise expectations, and then provide a stable
environment with clear channels of communication and authority. You need
to come across as decisive and organized, emphasizing firm procedures and
deadlines. Then get out of the way and respect the Gold’s unique ability to get
things done.
When selling to, persuading, or working with a Gold, make sure you first
have you own act together and any presentation or meeting will run smoothly.
Be reliable enough to arrive at your meeting on time. At all costs, avoid vague
information and abstract theories; stick with being factual, accurate, precise,
and down to earth. Make your points sequentially. Avoid words like feel and
believe. Use words like tradition, respected, and proven. Follow whatever pro-
cedures the Gold has requested. Respect the hierarchy of the Gold’s depart-
ment or company; if one says you have to talk to somebody else, he or she
means it and is not blowing you off.
COMMUNICATING SMOOTHLY WITH BLUES
When managing a Blue, you need to be visionary in order to capture his or
her interest. Explain how what you’re doing will have an impact in the
future—even have global consequences. Establish demanding goals or Blues
will get bored and distracted. Debate with the Blue and don’t take challenges
personally; it’s a sign you’ve got Blue’s interest. Be open to making changes
based on his or her insights and analytical skills. Above all, provide Blues
an autonomous environment with minimal guidelines. They won’t disap-
point you.
250
PA R T  6  |  G E T T I N G  T H E  J O B

When selling to, persuading, or working with a Blue, it is imperative to
come across as competent or he or she will not respect you or your message.
Present the “big picture” first and limit the facts, which dampen their interest.
Show the long-term potential of new solutions. Don’t become personally
offended by anything Blues say. Respond with ingenuity and logic. Avoid
words like feel and believe; use words like think and know. 
COMMUNICATING SMOOTHLY WITH REDS
When managing a Red, face to face is always better. Memos and emails do not
engage Reds. They need stimulation, fun, freedom, and independence to be
on top of their game, so provide them with the most flexible and self-paced
environment possible. Reds not only enjoy crises, they will create them if they
are bored; so avoid meetings, rules, and memos where possible. Use a Red to
solve problems and crises, and allow him or her to follow instincts. Reds are
difficult to control and impossible to micromanage, but they will not disap-
point you if you provide them the above conditions.
When selling to, persuading, or working with a Red, be brief and use
action verbs like stimulate, liven up, challenge, enjoy, and confront. Hands-on
demonstrations are way better than computer slideshows. For Reds, timing is
everything, so don’t continue if they’re distracted. Acknowledge the distraction
and ask to meet again later that day. Get to the point, avoid theories and
frameworks, and stress the immediacy of your solutions. Be very flexible,
open ended, and ready for fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants decisions and fast
closes.
COMMUNICATING SMOOTHLY WITH GREENS
When managing a Green, provide him or her with a harmonious environment
and stress opportunities for personal growth. Greens become troubled and
distracted by undue competition and personal conflict; minimize this among
coworkers. Personalize your working relationship—ask about their families
and pets in appropriate ways. 
Be inspiring and positive. Work with them to establish a mutually accepted
vision and allow them creative freedom to address it. Give frequent feedback,
but keep it diplomatic; they are turned off by harsh criticism or fear tactics.
They prefer to work collaboratively, so imposing strict hierarchies on Greens
reduces productivity rather than increasing it, as with Golds.
When selling to, persuading, or working with a Green, above all personalize
the relationship. Ask what he or she needs, then listen empathetically to the
C H A P T E R  2 4  |
B E F O R E  I  D O  S O M E T H I N G  S T U P I D
251

answer. Expect the Green’s discussion to be nonsequential, but know that he
or she will return to the original point. When presenting your product or
solution, give the big picture and limit support facts, unless they communicate
the impact on people. Use words like feel, believe, value, and like. Be insightful
and idea driven, and stress innovative and future-driven solutions.
INTROVERT VERSUS EXTROVERT
Often you will be communicating with someone who is your opposite. If you
find conversations getting cut short, this may be the reason. If you are an
Extrovert speaking with an Introvert, just bring your energy level down a
notch. Never jump in to fill an Introvert’s silence, no matter how uncomfort-
able it makes you. One time, I let an Introvert think silently for seven minutes
on the phone; he had constructed an entire conference panel for me with
topic, speakers, and copy.
If you are an Introvert speaking with an Extrovert, raise your energy level
a little, make eye contact, and ask questions to keep the dialogue going.
TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR WORK ENVIRONMENT 
If you have assessed correctly the primary Color of your boss or coworker,
you will see a dramatic and immediate improvement in your communications
using these Color Q guidelines. Relationships will improve, tasks will be
accomplished more smoothly, and teams will get less bogged down in conflict.
If following these tips does not produce much result, you need to reassess
that person’s primary Color or avoid behaviors typical of your own Color that
create communication irritants. (One example: Trying to force a sequential
conversation on a nonsequential-thinking Color.) The “Overall” Color chap-
ters can assist.
Before you quit your job, try changing your approach to those who irritate
you at work. At least you will add to your people skills. You may even get a
promotion, salary increase, or find you already have the job of your dreams.

Would I Make a Good
Entrepreneur?
THERE ARE THREE answers to the question, “Would I make a good entre-
preneur?”
1. All Colors can be entrepreneurs.
2. All Colors need the help of other Colors to succeed in their new ven-
ture.
3. Some Colors make better natural entrepreneurs than others (see
figure 25–1).
The reason you need the other Colors on your entrepreneurial team is that
natural entrepreneurs have their weaknesses and less-natural entrepreneurs
have their strengths. So it’s not where you start as an individual—it’s the team
you assemble that ultimately will make or break your venture.
FIGURE 25–1 Colors as Entrepreneurs

Golds
Greens
Remember, all Colors can be entrepreneurs because all need the help of the
other Colors to succeed. Golds and Greens should partner with Reds and
Blues to provide a balance of talent.
Here are the innate entrepreneurial styles of the four primary Colors. You
also will have some of the strengths of your backup Color as well.
The Gold Entrepreneurial Style
HOW GOLDS SET GOALS
You are one of the best of all Colors at setting goals and making plans to
achieve them. You prioritize, follow through, and evaluate progress effortlessly.
What you are not good at is modifying your well-laid plans to adapt to chang-
ing circumstances. 
Before casting your business plan in stone, run it by people you respect
who are of other personality Colors. Ask them what additional options to
consider, especially involving a work team or your family. Don’t rush into it,
even if you are excited and energized.
Then, schedule reevaluations at specific points along the way. Mark your
calendar to sit back and reflect whether your goals are being met or you need
to readjust them. You may be tempted to avoid this uncomfortable task; invit-
ing a Blue or Green to help prevents procrastination. This one exercise could
spell the difference between success and failure. 
GOLDS AT THE START OF THE VENTURE
You are not one of the world’s dreamers and schemers, but many Golds have
come up with brilliant business ideas and gotten rich from them. At your
core, you are driven to be a responsible overseer of people and resources, and
this makes you a cautious risk taker. In your favor, you are not likely to be
diverted by other opportunities, as Reds and Blues often are. You will rely on
tried-and-true methodology to move predictably from one milestone to the
next. Once in business, your first priority is establishing order. Systems and
procedures are in place virtually from day one. The sooner you can create pre-
dictability in your business, whether in sales, manufactured inventory, or cash
flow, the more comfortable you are.

Foreseeing and responding to changes in the marketplace will never be
your forte, and handling unexpected crises is downright stressful to you.
Make sure you have a Blue or Green on board to identify future trends that
might impact your business. Get a Red to buffer you from the normal crises
to which all young firms are subjected.
CASE STUDY ONE
The Rooneys—Father and Daughter 
Entrepreneur Team
Trisha Rooney Alden is president of R4 Services, LLC, a leading records-
management company she formed over two decades ago. She always wanted
to be an entrepreneur and has let little get in her way. This includes marriage,
having two babies, and joining her husband in another city while keeping her
business headquartered in Chicago. Shuttling between clients and family in
some fifty trips a year utilized all her Gold organizational skills. She needed help.
Enter her father, Phil, former CEO of a public company who, of late, had
been enjoying a stress-free life managing his investments. Today he comes
into R4 Services at 5:30 every morning without getting paid. Why so early?
“That’s when the day starts operationally,” he explains. “By 8 am clients have
urgent needs and we need to respond to them in a timely fashion.” 
For Golds, family is key, and Phil truly enjoys the opportunity of helping his
daughter fulfill her dreams (even in the early hours of dawn). Of course, he is
quick to point out that she makes all the decisions. “R4 Services was a multi-
million-dollar business when I came aboard,” he stresses. “I just provide sup-
port and advice where needed.” 
Trish and Phil are both Gold backup Greens, and the firm’s culture reflects
this. For instance, Trish has a small cubicle rather than a large corner office.
“I love it that way,” she says. “I am out of the office a lot with clients; this way
I get to hear everything that is going on,” she adds, reflecting the Green need
for connectivity.
In order to succeed in a business that handles intricate records manage-
ment and destruction issues for some 600 clients, collaboration between
father and daughter is key. So is listening to, and cultivating the opinions of,
the service and warehouse staff. Phil picks up donuts each morning to ensure
that the early arriving staff has something to eat. 
Both father and daughter take great pride in the low turnover of their staff,
noting 60 percent have been with the company for over ten years. They say
C H A P T E R  2 5  |

255

256
PA R T  6  |  G E T T I N G  T H E  J O B
one of their goals is to help employees have good lives and a great place to
work. This is a classic example of how Gold/Greens attend to the practical
needs of others.
Trish sees her top strengths as working well with people, listening deeply
to clients to discover needs, communicating clearly, and always delivering
what has been promised. All these strengths express her Gold/Green compo-
nents. Clients are highly energizing to her. “I like to organize them,” she says,
“and to call them often to talk about present and future needs. They are my
passion!” 
What about stress areas? Pricing services and having clients negotiate
downward are stressful, as are doing budgets and focusing on the financials
of the business. These reflect her Green side, which dislikes confrontation
and excessive work in the area of numbers. Here she relies on her father’s
thirty-plus years of business experience. 
As two Gold/Greens, father and daughter have established an easy work
relationship. He oversees operations, she focuses on new business develop-
ment. The mutual respect is evident and contributes to the firm’s steady
growth.
Meanwhile, they are also actively involved in a wide range of philanthropic
organizations involving children, museums, universities, and hospitals. In true
Gold fashion, they welcome opportunities to take care of their community.
The Red Entrepreneurial Style
CASE STUDY TWO
Serial Entrepreneur: Jewelry to 
Toiletries to Home Textiles
The Red personality makes a good entrepreneur. Reds are very present-
centered, able to see opportunities immediately. Red/Green Extroverts like
Dianne Morris create linear career paths from seemingly less-than-linear
opportunities.
In 1966, English major Dianne’s law school plans were derailed by family
economics. Undaunted, she found a special internship program at NASA. She
spent the next half-decade as a contract specialist at NASA and the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.

C H A P T E R  2 5  |
A  G O O D  E N T R E P R E N E U R
257
She came to realize that legal work did not hold her interest. (The details
of law can pose a problem for Reds, who need spontaneity and new chal-
lenges daily.) She did know she wanted the challenge of starting her own
company.
She enrolled in design classes and started creating jewelry pieces using
many unusual materials. “I think department stores were especially open to
new designers and innovations in the 1970s,” says Dianne.
She managed this company through a divorce and a move from Los
Angeles to New York City. There she met John Chapman, who was importing
soap from Spain and looking to distribute to hotels. As partners they created
Miraflores Designs. In the 1980s, they designed, manufactured, and distributed
coordinated lines of toiletries for Sheraton, Hyatt, and many other hotel
chains.
In 1986, they sold Miraflores to an emerging public company, leaving
Dianne the means to fund an “I Have a Dream” program for inner-city school
children. In 1990, it also allowed her to buy Charles Bay, Inc., which sold
flannel sheets to catalogs. “This was a rather low margin business. I evolved
it into Bay Linens, Inc., which produced higher-end top-of-the-bed ensem-
bles,” Dianne says. Customers included Bloomingdale’s, Horchow’s, and
Dillard’s department stores.
Not every opportunity a Red identifies is a good fit, however. “I also
acquired China Seas, a fabric company creating high-end fabrics for interior
decorators,” she says. “This proved to be too different and complex a market,
so I sold it at a loss.” 
But collegial Reds value more than money. “I kept the license with a
Japanese department store, which was a very enjoyable connection for many
years,” she says.
In a changing 2008 market, she licensed out the Bay Linens brand with an
agreement for consulting to the new licensee. “In 2010, I started to investigate
the idea of a website for women over 50. This became www.ZestNow.com,
which publishes writers with information and inspiration.”
Dianne’s college English major interests emerged in editing and writing for
the website. It’s ideal for both her spontaneous Red and people-oriented
Green personality traits. “This work can be done anywhere, anytime,” she
says. “I love the energy of new trends. Women over 50 and 60 form a new
force, with lots of exciting activities and relevant ideas.”

258
PA R T  6  |  G E T T I N G  T H E  J O B
HOW REDS SET GOALS
Reds don’t plan, they evolve. Planning is an ongoing process of flexible deci-
sions. You set goals by instinct, always ready to turn on a dime. The ability to
change direction based on market needs is a very real strength. But setting real
goals that others must work on is a challenge. Set short-term targets; your
people will have a clearer direction, and immediate successes energize you.
REDS AT THE START OF A VENTURE
Reds are the born entrepreneurs of the world but need the right circumstances
to thrive. You are natural risk takers, negotiators, and crisis managers, skills
that are critical in the startup phase of a venture. You excel as long as what
you are doing is in demand and business is brisk. When a venture ceases to
be fun and stimulating, your attention wanders. However, in crisis mode you
excel, coolly managing the situation long after others have caved in. 
Reds are impatient with formal education and prefer practical knowledge.
These street smarts serve you well in new ventures. When interested, you
become a real specialist in your field, with or without formal training. You see
rules and procedures as guidelines only and never feel particularly bound by
them (to the chagrin of any Gold partners). 
Your freedom of thought lets you surf the marketplace with fresh ideas and
new ways of responding to customer desires. A Green will help you market
those terrific ideas and get your promotional tasks done quickly. Conventional
ways are the last thing on your mind when beginning a new project. Strategic
thinking and organizational skills ultimately are needed, however. Bring a
Blue on board to help with strategy and a Gold to organize your office.
The Blue Entrepreneurial Style
HOW BLUES SET GOALS
You’re a natural at strategizing, creating plans, and refining them along the
way. Too much complexity is your goal-setting blind spot. Be sure to add prac-
tical details and concrete steps to your business plan. You won’t enjoy it, but
it will help keep you realistic about your plans.
CASE STUDY THREE
Bagels for Everybody
Nordahl “Nord” Brue is the founder of the Bruegger’s Bagel chain. Like many
Blues, he excels at combining passion, good ideas, and financial business

C H A P T E R  2 5  |
A  G O O D  E N T R E P R E N E U R
259
acumen into single entrepreneurial ideas. Others see him as both intense and
playful. “He is a deep thinker,” says Chris Dutton, former CEO of Green
Mountain Power, “who can analyze issues on several different fronts.”
Recognizing the many skills required to run a successful venture, Nord
always partners with someone whose talents enhance his own. Always a few
steps ahead of national trends, in the early 1980s he saw the potential of turn-
ing bagels—then a niche, urban product—into a “quick service” food
concept that would appeal to a national audience. Brue’s strategy was to start
in secondary and suburban markets, far away from metropolitan centers like
New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago where bagels were well known, in order
to test the economic feasibility while educating his customers’ tastes.
Brue was right. By the mid-1990s, Bruegger’s had grown into almost 500
stores throughout the country and ushered in the first “healthy alternative”
quick-food concept. He sold the company in 1996 for a stock trade worth $123
million, rebought the company for $45 million a year later, and resold it again
for an undisclosed amount in 2000.1
Brue has since chaired Franklin Foods, a soft, unripened-cheese manufac-
turer. While excited about its potential, he’s not wedded to it, or any company
he builds. “If Kraft says we have to have it, if it’s worth more to them than to
me, then I’ll do a new thing,” he told Vermont Business Magazine in January
2004.2 Brue, at the time of our interview, was also chairman of four boards,
which he thoroughly enjoys. “I am always better at dealing with the big pic-
ture,” he says, “which is another way of saying I am not great at the details.
My mission is to get these companies to articulate a vision that will take them
to the next level—I find that very exciting,” he says, in typical Blue fashion.
BLUES AT THE START OF A VENTURE
Many a Blue has launched a successful business off limited information or a
hunch. It’s the ideas that excite you, and you’re at the peak of your talents
when creating and refining them. You understand and accept that risks are
part of the deal, and you are well able to cope with them. 
Daily routine makes you restless; your style is to handle many projects at
once. Seeing new trends in the marketplace is an entrepreneurial strength. But
it can be a weakness in attempting to actually get things done.
Fortunately, Blues delegate freely and rely on other Colors instinctively.
You’re the idea person, and you want others to handle the people, procedures,
and controls. Make sure you get a Green on board to tap substantial people

and promotional skills, a Red to move things along, and a Gold to set up those
needed procedures.
The Green Entrepreneurial Style
HOW GREENS SET GOALS
For you, goals and plans are changeable, depending on whatever is exciting to
you at the moment. Prioritizing is problematic for you, especially when two or
more exciting things compete for your attention. The process and the people
you meet along the way are more important to you than final outcomes.
You will stick to a goal if it helps you find your deepest possible satisfaction.
If you can stick to a (relatively) permanent core goal, especially one that
reflects your personal values, underlying goals will be more achievable and less
of a distraction.
Other Colors will criticize and pressure you into making rigid, financially
oriented plans “to keep your business on the right track.” You will not com-
plete these plans and will frustrate those who depend on you to set direction.
You must have the ability to make legitimate detours while keeping sight of
the ultimate destination. More than any other Color, you need to partner with
a friend, preferably a Gold or Red, who can ground you in the present when
needed. You do best when collaborating with other Colors.
CASE STUDY FOUR
Restaurant Owner
You are an entrepreneur at heart if you have tons of ideas for improving every
company that hires you. During Sasha Fitzroy’s twenty-eight-year career as an
event planner, one fact bothered her: customer service was rarely prioritized. 
“Customers were expected to accept mediocre food, materials, even ven-
ues,” she recalls. “Where were the new customers coming from when disil-
lusioned ones stopped coming? An extra $10 upgrade in food or service would
produce hundreds or thousands of dollars in repeat business; but the bean
counters couldn’t track it, so they ignored it.”
Sasha dealt with these front-line complaints directly and yearned to start
a business where she could test her customer-service theories. She got her
chance in her fifties, when she and her husband opened a Connecticut break-
fast and lunch café on a sleepy, small-town Main Street with not much
chance of walk-in trade.
260
PA R T  6  |  G E T T I N G  T H E  J O B

“I knew we would have to create a destination business,” she says.
“What better way to do that than to implement my long-held customer-
service values?”
Sasha set out to call all her customers by name instead of number, quickly
learning the names of regulars. She brought food to the table instead of requir-
ing customers to pick it up, surveying their further needs as she did so. She
made personal connections wherever she saw an appropriate opportunity.
“My mission statement became, ‘I want each customer to walk out the door
happier than when they came in,’” she says. “People yearn for true welcome,
acceptance, and hospitality; to be treated as special.”
It worked. Almost 60 percent of independent restaurants fail or are sold after
three years.3 “Next year will be our fifteenth anniversary,” this people-oriented
Green states proudly. Sasha now passes her customer-service values on to her
four new employees. 
GREENS AT THE START OF A VENTURE
Greens are less motivated by material gain than other Colors. You prefer to
provide value and express your creative energies in whatever business situa-
tion stimulates you. Sometimes that will be an entrepreneurial venture, most
often prompted by a change in employment status, a disagreement with the
practices of an employer, or the need for a family-oriented work schedule.
The ability to create value is both your strength and your blind spot. You
will build an extremely loyal clientele, but often think little of sacrificing profit
margin to achieve a certain quality of product or service. This loyal clientele,
however, is the heart of your business success. High customer loyalty and low
staff turnover often get a Green enterprise through rough times when other
companies fail.
Your superior abilities to promote and market get you noticed quickly. A
Green company often takes off fast but then needs the tough negotiating skills
of Reds and the business systems implemented by Golds to survive in the fast
lane. You also have the added frustration that your considerable people and
communications skills are underestimated by other Colors, who want you to
focus on the balance sheet rather than the customer base.

FOR ALL COLOR Q personalities, money itself is either a mirror of self-
worth or a means to an end. But how we negotiate our salaries, manage our
budgets, and save for important goals is very much driven by our primary and
secondary Color Q personalities. Each Color has a different and unique com-
petence when handling this all-important aspect of life. Your natural Color Q
salary negotiating and investment styles have been researched by author
Shoya Zichy for over a decade with close to 4,000 people. Some of her pro-
prietary results are being made available here now, and only in this book.
Greens and Money
Given a choice, Greens prefer to deal with other things in life. When support-
ing just yourself, you see money as a tool to further your own personal devel-
opment and create aesthetic surroundings. The rabid pursuit of riches usually
turns you off. If you are the breadwinner, however, your attitude and involve-
ment change rapidly. People you care about depend on you, and you will
learn what it takes to provide for them.
Greens approach money in one of two predictable ways: you are either
focused or spontaneous. Focused Green/Golds take a disciplined approach to
saving for significant life goals like retirement. Spontaneous Green/Reds are
sporadic savers and planners at best and innately high-risk takers when
Money and Compensation
CHAPTER 26

investing. While Green/Reds seem unlikely to ever accumulate enough to
retire, you are supported by your almost psychic ability to predict investment
trends.
Both types of Greens develop warm, trusting relationships with advisors or
financial planners, serving as excellent sources of referrals. 
You want to hear how a company impacts people more than about its ana-
lytics before investing in its stock. Social investments are of particular interest
to you.
GREEN/GOLDS
Compensation When negotiating a compensation package, usually you do
not push hard enough. If you like the job and the people, and a reasonable
number is offered, you’ll take it. This often means you have folded too early
in the negotiation. You may even accept a salary lower than you want just to
get the job. 
Tips Don’t be so nice. Research what you are worth and practice negotiat-
ing, preferably with a Red friend. You have a right to expect reasonable com-
pensation for the value you provide. The other side expects you to play the
game, and you’ll leave money on the table if you don’t. It will never feel nat-
ural, but you can learn the game and play it well.
GREEN/REDS
Compensation The money a job pays is not your top priority. Does the job
help you grow? Does it allow you to express your creativity? Then lucky you,
you’ve hit the jackpot, and whatever it pays you is icing on the cake. You
expect people to notice your good work and increase your salary accordingly.
Of all the Colors, you need the most practice before walking into a salary
negotiation because you truly hate to argue, especially about money.
Tips As with the Green/Golds above, practice with a tough-minded friend
how to play the chess game of salary negotiations. Don’t accept the first
amount offered. Have a well-researched counteroffer in mind. This is the one
time in your life when it’s okay not to be nice. Make a list of things you could
buy with the extra money you negotiate; this will provide incentive. If the
salary remains low, suggest extra time off, a company vehicle, a private office,
or free health insurance for your family instead. Use phrases like, “With my
qualifications, I am expecting X.” You deserve to be compensated in a way
that means something to you for the value you provide.

Reds and Money
Reds are the risk takers of the investment world, especially when you feel you
have sufficient knowledge and disposable income. As in other areas of life,
you like to operate by your own rules. You can become quite adept at dealing
in the stock (and other) markets.
Your strength is picking up investment cues others miss. You’ll benefit from
your acute powers of observation and the broad storehouse of practical knowl-
edge you’ve accumulated since birth. These, combined with your above-
average flexibility, create opportunities you pounce on with good timing.
More than other Colors, you prefer to invest in individual stocks rather
than mutual funds unless handling family money. Advisors to you are a
source of research, execution, and record keeping. Detailed planning just gets
in the way of plunging into interesting investments. 
Your savings account, if it exists, is likely to be starved for attention. You
tend not to save. You simply don’t obsess about money and figure it will be
earned as needed.
RED/BLUES
Compensation For you, tomorrow is another day to earn another dollar. It’s
likely you have been through both rich and lean times. Your aggressive nego-
tiating style works well in compensation discussions. In fact, other Colors
come to you for advice before walking into salary negotiations.
RED/GREENS
Compensation You are a good negotiator, but your style is more relaxed than
that of Red/Blues. You also feel tomorrow is another day to earn another
dollar, and you can live on a lot of money or a little. You won’t, however, leave
any money or benefits on the table during salary negotiations.
Blues and Money
Blues use money as proof of competence. The higher your salary, the more
competent the world sees you. More than other Colors, you understand
money in the abstract as a flow rather than a stagnant resource. But
Blue/Golds and Blue/Reds differ in their approaches to money. Where
Blue/Golds are disciplined savers, Blue/Reds typically are not.
In your favor, you are intrigued by complex asset-allocation strategies that
determine how much to invest in stocks, bonds, and other vehicles. You will
benefit in real returns from this ability. Against you is your overconfidence.
264
PA R T  6  |  G E T T I N G  T H E  J O B

Because you are more likely than most to research and understand all the
components of your portfolio, you forget that markets are not always rational. 
BLUE/GOLDS
Compensation You know exactly how much you are worth before you walk
in the door to interview. You will drive compensation negotiations to their
highest possible level, leaving no money or benefit issue unexplored. Other
Colors come to you for advice before their salary negotiations. 
BLUE/REDS
Compensation You know what you’re worth, what’s available, and how to get
it. You relax into the process and enjoy the give-and-take of it. Often the peo-
ple with whom you’ve negotiated give you far more than they were intending
and come away feeling good about it. You are perhaps the smoothest negotia-
tor of all the Colors, leaving nothing on the table, and agreeably removing the
chairs as well.
Golds and Money
There’s a reason your group was named the Golds. Money is extremely impor-
tant to your sense of security. You are highly focused on saving and long-term
planning and fully in control of your cash flow at all times. You abhor the mis-
use of money and rarely go into debt or squander the assets you have.
Your investments have to be well-researched, backed by a solid track
record, and fully documented with concrete facts. As long as investments
meet these criteria, you’ll invest directly in the market; but mutual funds are
a popular option for Golds. You want your portfolio to be your passport to a
worry-free future, and you are likely to achieve this goal early in life. 
You have a limited tolerance for risk and volatility, favoring time-tested
strategies. Fixed-income instruments like bonds and Guaranteed Investment
Contracts make you comfortable in a portfolio balanced with blue-chip stocks.
Financially, you are a meticulous record keeper. You can reconcile the
accuracy of your accounts without the assistance of intermediaries. You prefer
working with well-established firms, insisting upon advisors who are organ-
ized and consistent and produce predictable results.
GOLD/BLUES
Compensation You are a focused and tough negotiator, having researched
what you’re worth well in advance. Gold/Blues can be prone to bag-person
C H A P T E R  2 6  |
M O N E Y  A N D  C O M P E N S AT I O N
265

syndrome, the fear you will wind up penniless on the streets. Because you feel
your security is on the line, you accept nothing less than everything there is
to get.
GOLD/GREENS
Compensation Although you, too, have the bag-person syndrome suffered
by your Gold/Blue cousins, it doesn’t drive your negotiation process as
strongly. Typically, you won’t push the envelope as hard at salary negotiations.
Consequently, you may leave the bargaining table with a sinking feeling that
you will not be making the money you deserve, unable to allay the lurking
bag person in your mind.
Tip You are organized enough to have researched what the market pays for
your skills but are likely to accept a lesser amount after one counteroffer. Role
play with a willing Gold/Blue, or any Red, to help you find strategies and
phrases with which you are comfortable. A Red/Green is particularly likely to
have a style you can emulate.

List five careers that you would like to research. (If you are already in the
workforce, include at least one that is different than what you are doing now.
If you are a student, choose one that is out of the pattern of your proposed
career path. Eliminate all careers you feel you ought to pursue and include
only those you’d enjoy pursuing.)

For each of the five careers you chose above, 
do the following steps:
1. Look up that career on the government’s website https://www.onet -
online.org.
2. Print out the activities and skills required for that career.
3. Compare these activities and skills against your profile’s description
of the ideal job. How well do they match?
4. Determine if you are you an Introvert or an Extrovert. Does the level
of people contact seem energizing or draining to you?
5. Research the educational requirements. Do you need more schooling?
6. Look at the bottom of the web page for the salary. Could you live
comfortably on it? 
7. Identify several companies you’d like to work for, listing pros and
cons.

8. Make a contact list—call or ask people you know for the name and
number of the right person to contact at your preferred companies, and
if possible research job openings before inquiring. Usually within six
random inquiries you will find someone who can make an introduction.
Review your desire to be an entrepreneur: 
1. List your top three entrepreneurial strengths as defined in your primary
Color section of chapter 25, “Would I Make a Good Entrepreneur?”
2. List your top three concerns about being an entrepreneur. Do a reality
check. Talk to several entrepreneurs in your community and ask how
they addressed these concerns. Most will be happy to talk with you.
3. List the skills you don’t have to be an entrepreneur. Next to each, make
notes on how you would get help with these. List the Colors with
whom you would need to partner (check your Entrepreneurial Style).
If you don’t have a clue what you want to do:
Think of a time you had a peak experience. What were you doing and why
were you successful?
What topics of conversation do you find fascinating?
To what kinds of magazines and articles are you drawn?
What recreational activities/hobbies do you enjoy most or have you thought
about starting?
Where are you on the stability versus change and risk scale? Place an X at
the appropriate point on the scale.
Want/Need Security //____________0____________ // Will Take Risks
Choose three careers that incorporate these interests and skills. (If you’re
good at something, like acting, don’t think you just have to be an actor.
Presenting skills and high ability to focus are skills used in such areas as
teaching, sales, and corporate training.)

MAKE YOUR CONTACTS COUNT 
BY ANNE BABER AND LYNNE WAYMON

Preface
Get Ready for State-of-the-Art
Networking
Everybody has contacts. Not everybody has contacts that count.
How about you?
As we’ve researched, written about, and spoken on networking,
we’ve discovered that only a fraction of people intuitively know
how to network. Everybody else can—and must—learn how.
The Time Is Right
When we began researching our ﬁrst book in 1987, networking had
its niche as a job-hunting and career advancement tool. And
women, wanting to break through the glass ceiling, saw how men
in business helped each other and called it ‘‘the old-boys’ network.’’
Women’s networking groups were springing up to encourage
women to learn the skills and to help each other. Networking was
seen as an extracurricular activity, not one sanctioned by or encour-
aged by employers unless, of course, it was for sales or business
development.
Things have changed since then. In the last several years, net-
working—often under a pseudonym—has become a hot topic. Pro-

F R E E  S A M P L E  O F  MAKE YOUR CONTACTS COUNT

fessors in business schools, senior executives in government, and
heads of corporations all tout relationship building as the key to
success.
You can hardly pick up a business school journal without seeing
an article on networking. University research is exploring such top-
ics as ‘‘social capital,’’ ‘‘communities of practice,’’ and ‘‘horizontal
integration.’’
One of the competencies now required for entry into the Senior
Executive Service—the U.S. government’s top ranking jobs—is
Building Coalitions/Communications. That competency is deﬁned
as the ability to explain, advocate, and express facts and ideas in a
convincing manner and to negotiate with individuals and groups
internally and externally. That competency also requires the ability
to develop an expansive professional network with other organiza-
tions and to identify the internal and external politics that impact
the work of the organization.
Corporate leaders are now seeing the business value of relation-
ship building. The CEO of one Fortune 500 company recently an-
nounced an initiative with ﬁve elements. Four of those imperatives
can only be accomplished as employees become proﬁcient in the
concepts and skills we cover in this book. What could be a louder
call or clearer deﬁnition for networking than this imperative: ‘‘Es-
tablish enduring, inclusive relationships within (the company) and
with our customers, employees, teammates, and community. En-
able mutually beneﬁcial partnerships that take full advantage of in-
ternal and external synergies. Understand the impact of personal
behavior on others, and place a high priority on honesty and integ-
rity.’’
So, just why is networking so important in today’s business en-
vironment?
Networking is now the essential professional competency for
employees at all levels. They need to develop strategic networking
skills and practices to excel at creating, cultivating, and capitalizing
on the cross-functional relationships that get things done and affect
the bottom line.
Networking is now the most important tool for intelligence
gathering. In business settings, such as conferences, trade shows,
meetings, and even golf outings, people need leading-edge network-

294
F R E E  S A M P L E  O F  MAKE YOUR CONTACTS COUNT
ing skills to ﬁnd the latest information on resources, trends, and
best practices.
Networking is now the antidote to the coming brain drain as
baby boomers retire. Experienced employees need networking ex-
pertise so they can pass on their valuable organizational and techni-
cal knowledge to newer, younger staff members.
Networking is now the critical strategy for business develop-
ment. Professionals and entrepreneurs need to know how to gain
visibility and credibility in their target markets, and how to build
and maintain relationships for long-term growth.
Networking is now a must-have capability for professional as-
sociation members. Members need networking skills to take advan-
tage of great connections at professional association meetings and
conferences and to bring back new ideas and practices into their
places of business.
Networking is the know-how for doing business in the U.S. In-
ternational businesspeople and students need to get comfortable
with and competent in the cultural ground rules for building rela-
tionships with Americans.
Networking is the method for personnel retention because it
creates feelings of inclusion and helps people from diverse back-
grounds feel listened to and valued at work.
Networking remains the primary technique that people use to
ﬁnd new jobs, change careers, or land on their feet after a layoff,
merger, or reorganization. People who are looking for career ad-
vancement need practical networking strategies to become the nat-
ural and only choice in the job market.
Are You Ready?
As you go through life, from graduation to the grave, you’ll have
thousands of encounters with people in business and social settings.
You know that networking is important. Yet, you may wonder
exactly how to create, cultivate, and capitalize on networking rela-
tionships and opportunities.

You know you should get networking on your calendar. Yet,
you may have trouble trying to ﬁt it into your busy lifestyle.
You know you need other people’s help to get your projects,
ideas, and initiatives off the ground. Yet, you may be unsure about
how to connect with key people to get the job done.
You know that visibility often results in promotability. Yet,
you may feel uncomfortable and shy about how to raise your proﬁle
in a way that ﬁts your organizational culture.
You know that networking is the way to expand your customer/
client list. Yet, you may wish you knew more about planning net-
working Projects that give you top of the mind awareness with cli-
ents and referral sources.
You know you should join groups to network. Yet, you may
be unclear about how to select the best ones and how to use them
to advance your career and business goals.
You know it’s valuable to go to professional meetings, trade
shows, and conferences. Yet, you may wish you were better equipped
to uncover resources, opportunities, and best practices at these
venues.
You know that your executives are pushing teamwork, con-
nectivity, horizontal integration, social capital, and the idea that
business development is everybody’s job. Yet, you may need to
sharpen your interpersonal skills to be a player.
That’s why we wrote this book: So that you can make network-
ing an art . . . not an accident.
The Contacts Count Networking System
This book, the second edition of our ﬁfth book, presents, for the ﬁrst
time in print, The Contacts Count Networking System (see Figure
P-1). Here, you will ﬁnd step-by-step guides to all aspects of net-
working. Most important, our System will help you take your net-
working from scattershot to streamlined and strategic.
Part I of this book gives you the tools to Survey Your Skills and
Mindset. Measuring your mastery of various networking skills will
give you a baseline. As you complete the comprehensive ﬁfty-

question Self-Assessment, you’ll be able to see which skills are sol-
idly part of your repertoire, and which ones you’ll need to work on.
But your skill level is only one part of your starting base. It also
makes sense for you to become more conscious of the beliefs you
hold about networking so that you’re not held back by misconcep-
tions or outdated attitudes.
Part II provides the underlying networking concepts you’ll need
to Set Your Strategy. After you know where you stand, you’re ready
for some big-picture concepts. We believe that the key to building
relationships is trust. The Trust Matrix portrays the power of dem-
onstrating your Character and Competence with everyone you
meet. Once you understand how trust is created, you’ll want to see
what kinds of relationships are possible as you network. The Six-
Stages Model provides a realistic picture of the variety of relation-
ships that are present in anyone’s network. Understanding the six
stages—and knowing what to do and say at each stage—puts you in
charge of the growth and development of your network. As you
clarify your goals, you’ll network more strategically to achieve
them. And sizing your networking Projects to ﬁt your goals will

guarantee you get the most from your investment of time and
money.
Part III helps you Sharpen Your Skills. Central to our System
are the essential face-to-face networking skills that will take you
comfortably and professionally from Hello to Goodbye. Because we
have worked with people in almost all walks of life, in all kinds of
businesses, at every level of the hierarchy, you can be sure that
we’ve covered all the bases. Using focus groups, interviews, and
research, we’ve developed the most complete encyclopedia of real-
world, ﬁeld-tested networking know-how. We’ve invented models
and formulas, collected best practices and examples, created check-
lists and quizzes, and identiﬁed Frequently Asked Questions and the
most common networking dilemmas. As you apply this compre-
hensive and practical spectrum of skills, you will be equipped to
reach your goals.
Part IV guides you as you Select Your Settings. If you want to
network at work, you’ll get the tools you need to assess your cor-
porate culture, identify key people and activities, and build cross-
functional relationships that get things done, affect the bottom line,
and advance your career. If you want to network in the world, you’ll
ﬁnd the tools to help you choose and get the most out of a variety
of venues. You’ll maximize the effect of your participation in pro-
fessional associations, referral groups, civic and community organi-
zations, volunteer and networking activities, at conventions and
trade shows, and in social situations.
When you’re hunting for a job or want to change careers, we’ll
coach you to apply your networking skills in well-chosen arenas
until you hear the words, ‘‘You’re hired!’’
Survey your skills and mindset, set your strategy, sharpen your
skills, and select your settings. Use this system to Make Your Con-
tacts Count.
Our best to you,
Anne Baber and Lynne Waymon
