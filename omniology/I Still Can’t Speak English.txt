Introduction
1	 Introduction
If you have studied English for some time; if you have taken lots of different classes, studied using 
lots of different course books, listened to lots of audio and still do not feel confident when you speak 
English (but desperately want to); this ebook is for you. If you use it properly it should be the last 
English course you ever need to use. To start building your own special English course now, just go 
straight to page 26 of this manual.
English as a Second Language (ESL) teaching and learning has not changed much for decades. The 
majority of ESL courses are taught in the same way and millions of hardworking learners still cannot 
speak English. Sorry to break the news but I think that this is a huge waste of time, effort and money 
and that it does not have to be like this. I even found some academic research that proves that ESL 
doesn’t help you to speak English1,
“In short, educational outcomes measured by way of dropout, failure, and low achievement 
on standardised tests all suggest that for some reason ESL learners do not benefit from ESL 
programming.” (Roessingh 2004) 2

Introduction
A more recent piece of research called Evaluation of the Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada 
(LINC) Program3, carried out by the Canadian government, clearly shows that the improvement in 
speaking after 1000 hours in the ESL classroom is statistically the same against a control group that isn’t 
in school at all. So, the study showed that there was no improvement whatsoever.
Since I started English Out There (EOT) in 2001 it has produced English teaching and learning materials 
based upon 250,000 hours of teaching and constant student and teacher feedback from the field (i.e. the 
streets of London). Because of the process followed in every lesson the materials were also suitable for 
online use with social media such as Facebook and Skype.
If you read this manual and follow the instructions accurately and carefully you will start to become 
comfortable speaking English. This is not just another marketing claim, it is a fact and we can prove it 
with ‘before and after’ audio case studies. It is true because we all learn languages the same way and you 
just need to provide your brain with the right amount and type of information (i.e. understandable and 
interesting language) for it to begin to notice patterns that mean something to you.
To become an independent English learner you will also need to do a little bit of work but the more you 
do the more interesting and motivating it will become. The first three or four lessons are the hardest; 
that is when you learn how to learn to speak English.
English Out There is a process and like any process if you miss one bit out you will not get the result 
you desire. We can provide some online help and support but most of it is up to you now, but you can 
do it, you can finally speak English comfortably.
You can follow me and EOT on Twitter (@EnglishOutThere), Facebook4 and Google+. I’m happy to 
answer specific questions about this ebook and look forward to hearing from you.

Why Do We Talk?
2	 Why Do We Talk?
Well, we already know why, don’t we? But just to make sure, an MIT professor called Deb Roy made 
his baby son a study of first language acquisition in the Human Speechome Project5 and it is amazing to 
watch him acquire language in huge detail, but for me the most important conclusion of the programme 
comes towards the end.
The final conclusion is that language is a social, real world inspired phenomenon in humans and this 
is just what we at English Out There have believed all along and it is what our courses are based upon.
Below is the professor’s TED talk: Deb Roy: The Birth Of A Word  6
Watch a Youtube trailer for a programme about the MIT professor’s study here:

How We All Learn to Speak
3	 How We All Learn to Speak
A new view of language acquisition7 talks about how infants acquire language and how early learning is 
achieved in a purely social context. The evidence suggests social learning shapes the neural framework of 
the brain for language and communication. Using brain imaging bilingual babies often show up activity 
in two overlapping areas, one for each language. I saw mentions of ‘social interaction’, ‘mapping’ and 
‘multiple listenings’ in infants and then second language acquisition was mentioned towards the end.
Another paper by Dr. Kuhl and Maritza Rivera-Gaxiola, Neural Substrates of Language Acquisition8 
contains a whole section on ‘social learning’. At the end of ‘Neural substrates…’ Dr. Kuhl asks this question:
“Why are adults, with their superior cognitive skills, unable to learn as well as young infants? 
Can techniques be developed to help adults learn a second language?”
Dr. Kuhl’s experiment with infants, helping them to acquire Mandarin, is very similar in execution (as 
it is described by her) to what we do using our English Out There materials with adult English learners.

The Psychology of Speaking English
4	 The Psychology of Speaking 
English
I wonder if students actually realise that a large part of the problem they experience with improving 
their speaking and listening skills is psychological and not linguistic.
I have met many learners of English over the years who desperately want to improve their speaking and 
listening skills but through some deep belief planted earlier in their lives they think that what they need 
is more grammar and correction. This is because of the way educational systems, and English Language 
Teaching and learning (ELT) the world over, has stuck by a system of a) teaching to tests and b) either 
completely ignoring the psychology of language learning or failing to integrate psychologically supportive 
techniques into ELT curricula.

The Psychology of Speaking English
It is an enormous and complex problem that places like China and India are trying to solve at the 
moment. Both educators and students regularly recommend ‘more of the same’ in terms of tuition even 
though it is not helping to address the speaking issues that clearly exist. At its root I would suggest that 
the concept of what does and does not make a proper educational programme is decided by people who 
prefer others to follow the path that they themselves followed.
This could explain why change is so slow and why awareness and value is so hard to earn for something 
that is quite different. Think of how many students in China are learning English in school or university. 
If they genuinely felt that the classes were giving them what they needed the phenomena of Mute English9 
(millions of learners can read but not speak English) and English Corners10 (informal speaking practice 
in parks and public spaces) would not exist and the huge rush to online language exchange and real 
practice websites would not be growing fast. The learners, through the internet, are trying to find their 
own way to improve the skills that they can’t get in formal classes but know they need.
How many teachers recommend online speaking and listening practice to their students or the use of 
structured and pre-taught conversation topics prior to real practice with a fluent or native speaker? And 
if they do recommend it, how should it be done to be effective?

What Stops You Speaking?
The human brain can operate well whilst experiencing high levels of anxiety, even stress. In fact, a little 
stress is good for performance. Rugby commentators say that someone is “up for it” and really mean 
that the player is at the optimal level of nervous stimulation to perform at their very best.
But it is a delicate path that we all follow when the adrenalin starts to pump. That feeling of nervous 
anxiety and excitement running through our body is often the difference between doing something well 
and not doing it properly at all.
However, under-stimulation is not the only way you and I can fail to perform. Over-stimulation, or 
over anxiety about what we are about to try and do can get so powerful that beyond a certain point our 
performance drops like a stone and we fail miserably. We miss the crucial injury time penalty, we lose 
our temper and get sent off, or when we are put in the spotlight we don’t speak clearly or forget what 
to say completely.
Some scientists even created a law, the Yerkes-Dodson law13, which explains the relationship between 
arousal and performance. Over-arousal for a task, such as speaking a foreign language without the right 
mental preparation and support, can lead to a complete drop-off in performance and the memory will 
struggle.

What Stops You Speaking?
This anxiety or stress when trying to speak a second language has another name, lathophobic aphasia, 
which is defined as the failure to speak a new language for fear of making a mistake. Sound familiar 
anyone?
So, what can be done about it? How do you improve your ability to speak when you have been afraid 
to do so, often despite years of English tuition and a good ability to read and write the language? The 
current boom in online language exchange and practice shows that learners are desperate to improve 
their speaking skills, look at a forum14 I found, which is just one example of how Chinese English learners 
acknowledge the problems they have.
I would argue that this is a typical situation in the lives of millions of English learners and that they are 
not getting what they really need from conventional English language lessons and materials. I’m biased 
of course, but anxiety and stress, in fields of activity outside of language learning, are commonly and 
actively ‘managed’ by mental and physical processes put in place to help the person to overcome the 
fear that stops them performing properly. I am telling you that English learners can also be helped, but 
that the English teaching world has not gone there yet.

Learning How to Speak (again)
6	 Learning How to Speak (again)
6.1	
Method
The way most courses and teachers work can actually stop you speaking English. This is because they 
teach you to write before they teach you to speak. When you try to speak you make sentences as if you 
were going to write them. So you translate and create whole sentences in your head.
When you are in a conversation and have to respond quickly to keep the communication going the 
more you try to create grammatically perfect sentences the more pressure (“arousal” or “anxiety”) you 
experience.
All language learners need some time to absorb and get used to the basic patterns of communication in 
the second language. It is OK not to talk and just to read and listen. The more you do this and the more 
you understand of what you read and hear the better. This is how you get going and lay foundations 
for speaking.
If you are a real beginner and have never studied English before the best thing you can do is to start 
reading like a small child and get used to the sounds and patterns of very simple sentences. You don’t need 
to know the rules (grammar) but if you really want something to be a bit clearer it is OK to look up the 
rule or have someone explain it to you. But don’t just study grammar and expect it all to stick. It won’t.
Most English learners have had some exposure to English already and often, because of the teaching 
techniques used, have studied a lot of grammar already. If you have studied a lot of grammar it doesn’t 
necessarily mean you can also speak comfortably.
In fact, the reverse is often true and people who know a lot of grammar and can read and write fairly 
well are still very low level speakers. Again, this is because they try to speak the way they write.
6.2	
Correction
Through most courses teachers correct students’ accuracy and pronunciation, often in front of other 
students in the class. This can cause problems because students who get very little opportunity to speak 
anyway are faced with a severe test of their ability to speak accurately in front of all of their friends and 
the teacher. Ask most students what was the scariest thing about their language lessons in school and 
they will usually say “speaking in class”.

Learning How to Speak (again)
Everyone needs some correction, but the wrong kind of correction can be very damaging to confidence 
and when damage has been done it is often extremely hard to repair.
English Out There repairs this damage by preparing and enabling learners to have positive speaking 
experiences, with non-teachers.
6.3	
Personalization
Every conversation you have is unique and highly personalized. Even if you try to have exactly the 
same conversation separately with three different people each conversation will be very different. The 
only constant in each will be you. So if you record and listen to them again they will, naturally, be 
personalized to you.
By recording your English Out There conversations and listening again you are creating an amazingly 
personalized and super-interesting English course for your brain to learn from naturally.
6.4	
Transparency
In a second language, especially when you are at the beginning, you need to get comfortable using the 
main patterns of conversation. Often these are the hardest things to grasp because they are deeply rooted 
in the natural flow of the language. Often they involve grammatical rules that someone a long time ago 
decided should only be taught at a higher level.
English Out There lessons sometimes give you bits of language and don’t explain them. They are there 
because that is how people speak and they help you get into a conversation in which you understand 
the meaning of what is being discussed.
So, how do you make sure you can practice properly when you have the opportunity to speak with a 
fluent English speaker who is happy to help you? You prepare before you speak.
It is better to have lots of short similar conversations with lots of different people in which you, the 
learner, are in control, than to have one long conversation in which you are not in control and end up 
struggling for understanding and also struggle for something to say.
English Out There gives you more control of your practice and having fewer surprises lowers your level 
of anxiety. When you are less anxious it makes it easier to speak.
Having three or four similar practice conversations with different people but based upon the same lesson 
and language means that you will become less anxious each time you have a successful conversation and 
your confidence will start to grow. This is very important to your development as an English speaker. 
You will begin to enjoy using English.

Case Study 1: Jane
7	 Case Study 1: Jane
I found Jane, an adult Chinese English learner (27), on EnglishClub.com. She was recruited via an offer 
I made in an online forum. I offered to give free help to two learners who were frustrated and wanted 
to improve their English speaking skills. The offer was for free course materials and online speaking 
practice in return for agreement to allow me to record and publish everything we did together.
Jane downloaded the MP3 recordings of her conversations and put them on her iPod before listening 
again a few times.
This process of storing the recordings online meant that they were secure yet accessible. It was really like 
building Jane’s own highly personal audio-lingual English course, with her as the star!
All I did on the calls was respond to Jane’s questions and have a pleasant conversation as a fluent English 
speaker would. I did not teach her in the conventional sense and correction only occurred as part of a 
natural desire to establish mutual understanding. I would spell words sometimes and help Jane with her 
pronunciation when it interfered with understanding. We worked blind, using audio only; so I never 
saw Jane’s face.

Case Study 1: Jane
After the sixth lesson I decided to edit together clips from the first and sixth conversations to compare 
Jane’s speaking performance. This created the ‘before and after’ podcast that shows how much she 
improved in that short period of time.
Results
These can be found on my podcast page at:
http://languagesoutthere.podomatic.com/entry/2010-04-29T10_09_39-07_00
Please listen to the recording. It is the recording of Jane ‘before and after’ her six lessons. The notes with 
the podcast explain Jane’s background and how I worked with her. Here are some of Jane’s comments 
that I think are worthy of being highlighted:
“Well, after several regular communications online with professor Jason including lots of exercises 
in the plans, they made me not only enrich my vocabulary, but also made English speaking become 
kind of a habit for me.”
And,
“I downloaded every recording when Jason posted them online. And I put them on my iPod, and 
listened to them when I was free. It’s very interesting to listen to my conversations with Jason 
because through it, I can discover what I need to improve again. On the whole, studying English 
in this new way made me not just improve my English level (especially speaking), but made me 
many friends all around the world.”
Jane successfully became an autonomous English learner. You can do this too, if you work the way Jane did.

Liliana found me in a Facebook group I set up called I Still Can’t Speak English. She got some free sessions 
with me because she won my competition to find the most frustrated English speaker. Liliana had been 
trying to learn how to speak English comfortably for over twenty years, using different methods that 
cost her lots of money. She found me on Facebook and joined my group for people who have almost 
given up hope of ever speaking English comfortably. She is now in her forties and specifically wanted 
to improve her spoken English to find a job in Bogota.
There were lots of people in the group trying to get some free help from me. Below is what she wrote 
about her struggle to improve her spoken English (my comments are in orange).

Case Study 2: Liliana
In the second clip she controls the conversation and talks with minor input from me for almost three full 
minutes whilst she tells me a story about one of her previous English teachers and his dream about her.
The aim of working with Liliana was to finally, after over twenty years of English study using other 
courses, help her to feel comfortable speaking English with a fluent English speaker.
Have a listen and let me know what you think?
Now listen to what Liliana herself thinks about her experience with EOT,
This is the last 10 minutes of our session 18 and I thought it was such a nice discussion and Liliana 
sounded so happy with her EOT course that I wanted to create a separate shorter clip to post online.
What we talk about here is what is possible if you just do what Liliana did and follow the EOT worksheets, 
do the speaking practice on Skype and listen to your recordings a few times.
http://languagesoutthere.podomatic.com/entry/2012-05-03T16_03_57-07_00
This was in a Facebook message from Liliana a few months after we finished the course,
“Jason, you have been the best teacher I’ve ever had. Without your help I had not been able to improve 
my fluency!  ”
It makes me very proud to have helped Liliana to get over her fear of speaking English after so many 
years of trying and spending so much money (she even paid for British Council courses, ouch!).
Thanks for working hard Liliana and for being a great example for others who might think that they 
will never be able to speak English comfortably.

Summary of Case Studies
9	 Summary of Case Studies
Jane and Liliana found me online when I offered to help them. They had both studied English for a 
long time and felt extremely frustrated but their frustration is very common. There are many millions 
of English learners just like them who will also benefit in the same way, and that includes you.
It wasn’t me who made the difference to their English. It was the fact that they used the EOT course 
materials, prepared before they spoke, followed the process and listened to themselves speaking. I did 
not teach them in the way that teachers normally try to teach you.
Jane and Liliana’s brains adjusted quite naturally because they received the right amount of extremely 
interesting linguistic data in English at precisely the right level, their current speaking level (and 
sometimes just a little bit higher). My role could have been filled by any friendly English speaker with 
some time to spare. The traditional role of the English teacher changes and becomes one of a facilitator 
or linguistic guide. With a little thought, some practice and a little patience it is fairly easy to do.
If you follow the same process that Jane and Liliana did, your English speaking will improve very quickly.

What We Think Happens
10	 What We Think Happens
The idea behind EOT is to make the practice conversation enjoyable and personally memorable to try 
to improve recall of the language when it is needed again at another time. The practice session can be 
repeated with numerous different practice partners and not become stale or boring because everyone 
naturally responds slightly differently.
The repetition of the patterns of successful communication and the negotiation of meaning leading to 
shared understanding in natural conversation produces a very intense but manageable and personalised 
social learning experience. This is similar to how we learned our first language but is faster because we 
have already learned one language fluently, have adult brain power and a few tools (grammar rules and 
technology) to turbo-charge the process.
I often get calls on Skype from English learners who wish to practise their English with me. I normally 
don’t take unscheduled calls of this nature but from time to time, to create a ‘control’ to the case studies 
and to illustrate what happens when someone doesn’t prepare properly before they try to speak, I have 
taken the calls and recorded them. You can listen to a prime example with another Chinese English 
learner, Amy, on my podcast page here:

I Still Can’t Speak English
26 
What We Think Happens
The preparation is important for a few reasons. Firstly the exercises rehearse the language to be used. 
Secondly the language studied is at your approximate current speaking level and thirdly it gives you 
something to talk about, a way into a conversation that is interesting to you and your partner and helps 
create a conversation.
When you perform a series of successful practice conversations that you had previously thought 
impossible you experience a noticeable emotional reaction. This reaction is one of excitement even 
euphoria or rapture (think about Flow Theory15)
When a series of lessons that produce this reaction to real language use are put together to form a 
course, it is possible to reduce your level of anxiety before and during speaking, boost your confidence 
considerably, improve your fluency, improve your accuracy and make the whole experience sociable, 
memorable and enjoyable.

11	 How to Plan Your Personalized 
English Course
To create your own study plans for self-guided speaking practice you need to find some English learning 
materials. Then organise them to give you just enough information to be able to have a conversation at 
your current speaking level.
Most language learners know where they are weak, they don’t need to be told, especially if they have 
been learning the language for a few years.
• Choose a few areas of language that you really want to improve and think of the topics that 
will enable you to use that language. You can use the English Out There course overviews at 
the end of this ebook to select topics and grammar points at each level.
• Then find some content in a course book or online that requires you to do some reading as 
well as some written exercises that give you between one and two hours of work with the 
language.
• Really focus on a specific area you feel you have trouble with. It doesn’t matter if it is fairly 
easy and you don’t feel you are learning much from the content. The focus of your attention 
should be on the speaking task to follow, the performance; that is the important thing.
• Once you have the topic and content you will work with, before you try speaking, go onto 
YouTube and put the topic and/or language focus into the search box. This should give 
you some videos to watch that include use of the language you are going to study and then 
speak.
• Once you have worked for an hour or so, or feel ready to have a conversation about the 
topic you have chosen, write four or five open questions to ask your speaking practice 
partners (i.e. questions that require the other person to repeat some of the language in the 
content you just studied and use full sentences in their reply).
For example, I use Google Docs in Google Drive to collect and curate content from the internet. Just open 
a new document and click on Tools and Research and a search box will appear on the right of the screen.
Type in the language area or topic you want to learn and then practice. Let’s say travel advice and degrees 
of obligation and advice – modals (these are the topic and language focus from EOT TD4 lesson 9, see 
the end of this ebook for more suggestions).
I just typed in ‘travel advice YouTube’ to get some videos that contain the language I want to hear and 
then use myself. To add them to your document just roll your mouse over the words or image and click 
on insert link. You can drag images to your document page too.

If you want to filter the web content you find, and use by reading level, this is possible in a full Google 
search. You can choose between basic, intermediate and advanced level results. Google search does all 
of the work for you.
This is a great thing to do to make the language and exercises fully comprehensible before you try to speak. 
You want to feel very confident reading and writing the lesson content before trying to use it to speak.
Always search for content just below your normal reading and writing level. By doing this the language 
in the content you read will be easier to understand and will prepare you better for your speaking task 
at the end. You can always add more difficult language to the lesson later.

especially when you first start working with someone new.

You need to build trust and you do that by being focused, keeping the calls short and being interesting 
and then quickly saying “Thank you, goodbye”. What this behaviour tells your new practice partner is,
• You are serious
• You are prepared
• You won’t waste their time
• You won’t talk forever or try to keep them talking
• You have something interesting to talk about
• You are a considerate human being
• You respect them
After three or four experiences like this they will start to trust you, get to know you, like you and, possibly, 
want to talk for a bit longer as they explore your world through talking to you.
BUT, you must never try to make calls longer than they need to be (10 to 20 minutes) or make unprepared 
calls because to a fluent or native speaker it will be obvious and it will annoy them. It is very obvious 
to the English speaker when you have not done your homework. If you don’t prepare before you speak, 
the experience for you, and just as importantly for them, will not be a good one.
The end result will be that you will lose a golden opportunity to have a long and satisfying social learning 
friendship with a generous English speaker. Treat your practice partners like you treat your bank manager 
or your doctor.
If you do treat them with respect, they will look after you and give you months of practice, help and 
advice for free. What is that worth to you, your family and your future? They are giving you a very 
valuable gift, treat it with great care.
Create one or two lessons and give them a try with someone you know well, not a new practice partner. 
If they seem to work and you feel you got some good focused practice then go on and create a series of 
lessons that work just as well. This is your course.
You can also use the topics and language focus areas in our ready-to-use worksheets. The course overviews 
are at the end of this ebook with some sample worksheets.
Remember the lessons need to provide you with content and questions that not only help you to practise 
the language you need to be able to use but also provide some entertainment and stimulation for your 
friendly English speaking friends.

You must keep it interesting and fun for them too or you will lose them and they won’t pick up your 
messages and calls in the future! You want to try to build strong, close and long-lasting relationships 
with your practice partners. They are your new best friends. They will form what online educators call 
your Personal Learning Network or PLN. Your PLN is a very powerful and life changing tool.

So, now you know that the key to success is being able to create a lot of special and successful speaking 
practice experiences that are at just the right level and that are also very personal to you; and to then 
listen again a few times.
The technology you need to achieve this has existed online, for free, since about 2003. Skype Beta launched 
on 29th August 2003. There are now lots of applications like Skype and Skype itself has been integrated 
with Facebook (which I got very excited about at the time it happened).
These are the technological tools you need to improve your English super fast.
1.	 Free cloud content curation and organisation service like Google Drive, Padlet.com or 
WangPan (make sure you can upload from your smartphone and access content on your 
smartphone)
2.	 Free online Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application e.g. Skype, MSN, Google 
Hangouts, QQ etc.
3.	 Free online social network e.g. Facebook, Google+, Edmodo, YY, Orkut, italki.com 
(language)
4.	 Free VoIP recording device e.g. MP3 Skype recorder (voipcallrecording.com)
5.	 Free podcast/audio file storage e.g. soundcloud.com, podomatic.com
Create free accounts with all of them and then.
1.	 Make some English speaking friends online
2.	 Choose topics and specific language you want to be able to speak and create your own 
learning content.
3.	 Prepare questions using the content you have collected.
4.	 Call three or four practice partners, have the same conversation with them and record them 
all.
5.	 Upload the MP3s to your audio store and then listen again whenever you can (on your PC, 
phone or MP3 player) or upload the MP3s direct to your cloud content folders next to your 
lesson content and listen to them again from there.
And that is it. See, you can already do most of that, on a PC, Mac, tablet, or even a smartphone.
Can’t you?

What you might find the most difficult bit is creating ten or twenty (or more) lessons from learning 
materials you find online. That just takes a bit of work plus getting the level right for your own speaking 
level; creating useful questions can take time too but it is good for your English.
Lots of people do this with content all of the time, but some people need a bit more help to create the 
lessons. That is why we created the EOT lesson worksheets. They are simple, tried and tested lessons that 
work with all online social learning tools to help you to create your own personalized English speaking 
course. Of course there are new platforms and services coming online all of the time. You can successfully 
use any of them when you study the EOT way (such as Verbling.com17 which is new and enables you to 
randomly meet English speakers instantly for video speaking practice, try it!).
EOT works with all of these platforms and services because it was designed for use by learners having real 
conversations on the streets of London with complete strangers. Basically, anywhere that two people can talk 
to each other is good for EOT practice. This means you can do EOT face-to-face or online. Or do a bit of 
both. You can record face-to-face EOT conversations with your mobile phone voice recorder or video camera.
The tools you need to use are everywhere and you already know how to use them to create personalized 
content in themed libraries of images, videos and MP3s (such as for work projects or for family albums). 
Now do the same for your English!
Store your personalized EOT course in a cloud storage application like Google Drive or Padlet.com (see 
image below) and then work and listen on your smartphone when you have a few minutes to spare.

13	 Meeting English Speakers & 
Building Learning Relationships
This wasn’t too easy in 2007 when we first published our materials but every day it gets easier as the 
world gets more and more social. Follow these instructions, they will help you to make the most of the 
learning materials you collect.
Make contact with some fluent or native speakers via Skype, Facebook or an online language exchange like 
Busuu.com18, Italki.com19, Livemocha.com20, Mylanguageexchange.com21, Palabea.com22 or The Mixxer23 
or through Skype language learning forums24.
And/or use Google to search for an ‘English speaking partner’, ‘volunteer English speaker’, ‘language 
exchange’ or ‘language swap’. There are lots of places to meet friendly English speakers online.
Make initial contact with them by text, video mail or voice mail, this is polite before you call someone; 
even if you can see they are online. In the message tell them what you want to talk about (i.e. the lesson 
‘topic’) and say it will only take a few minutes. DO NOT just call them. They will not answer you and it 
will annoy them. With the first few partners set a weekly time to talk and stick to it!
It’s also a good idea to make friends with quite a few people around the world in different time zones. If 
you have eight to ten friendly practice partners you will find that one or more will be online and happy 
to talk when you want to do some practice. Tell them that you want to practise with them and that it 
will only take a few minutes each time you call them and that they don’t need to do any preparation to 
have the conversation.
1.	 Use a good dictionary
2.	 Make sure you understand the final Out There task.
3.	 Try to relax.
4.	 Call one of yourOut There conversation partners and practice the language you have just 
studied.
5.	 Record it and listen again, then call other Out There conversation partners for further 
practice.

Complete the whole task and use your partners to cover all of the language in the lesson but feel free to 
talk about other subjects with them once you have covered the language in the lesson; and most of all 
have fun and get to know your partners well. They are there to help you improve your English.

Hi, I hope you don’t mind me contacting you this way but I am following a new English course called English 
Out There (http://englishoutthere.com/about-us/volunteer-with-english-out-there) which involves me 
asking fluent and native English speakers like you a few quick conversational questions on interesting topics 
every now and then.
When I have done a class and I need to practise the language from it I will only need about ten minutes 
with you to ask my questions and have a quick chat. Then I will go and speak to someone else or you can 
ask me some questions in English or my first language (if you are learning it and want some practice). It 
would also really help me to improve if you allowed me to record us talking because by listening to myself 
speak I will improve quicker.

Helping learners to practise their English
Welcome to English Out There. You will be talking to learners who are new to your first language. These 
instructions will help you to make the most of your conversations with these learners face-to-face, on VoIP 
and inside virtual classrooms. When talking to a learner remember these important tips:
--
Be patient and speak slowly enough for the learner to understand you. Help the learner to 
relax.
--
Listen carefully. Learners have varying pronunciation skills depending on their first language 
and level. Be forgiving and ask them politely to repeat words and phrases you do not 
understand or ask them to write the word or phrase in the chat box also. Say ‘can you spell it?’ 
or spell what you think they are saying and ask them if that’s what they mean. Repeat what 
they say or what you think they said as this will help them to hear how you pronounce the 
words.
--
Encourage them to stick to the topic and vocabulary from the lesson first but don’t worry 
if they ask other questions. Conversations should be as natural as possible. Sometimes as 
the learner’s confidence increases and they become comfortable, they might ask you totally 
unrelated questions.
--
Do not stop and correct everything. We want the learner to become more fluent and their 
confidence to build. Make sure you correct key things. Maybe even ask them at the start ‘How 
much correction would you like?’
--
If they get stuck and the conversation dries up, ask them if they are okay and then ask them if 
they wish to continue or go back over something. Help them to relax. Ask them if they wish to 
talk about something else.
--
Never feel awkward if there is silence – they might be thinking hard and always give them 
audible clues that you are listening, such as saying ‘uh-huh’ or ‘yes’. This will give them 
confidence that you understand what they are saying.

I Still Can’t Speak English
45 
Meeting English Speakers &  
Building Learning Relationships
--
Get to know the learner: nurture them, build trust and enjoy the conversation. NEVER tell 
them something about the language that you are not completely certain about. The learners 
will respect you more if you are honest and say ‘I don’t know’. You are not expected to teach 
them. You are there to facilitate real practice of the target language.
--
Let them finish the conversation in their own time and always ask them if they felt that they 
learnt something or found the conversation useful. When they answer ‘yes’ it will make you feel 
good too!
--
Please let them record the sessions, it will be a huge help to their learning process if they can 
listen to the conversation again as many times as they want. They might also send it to their 
teacher for comment.
If you want to better understand how you, as a fluent or native English speaker, can help people around 
the world to benefit from improving their English DOWNLOAD this amazing free ebook and send it to 
your friends:
The world is your language learning community, do not abuse it. Have fun!

By now I hope you have listened to the audio before and after clips of Jane and Liliana and had a think 
about the process of EOT and how you can use it to help yourself.
Remember. To create your own study plans for self-guided speaking practice you need to collect some 
materials by searching online and then organise them using any online cloud document creation system 
(Google Drive, Office Apps, or Wang Pan) to give you just enough Input to be able to have a conversation 
at the right level for you.
Make sure. To try out your first few lessons with someone you know so that you can judge their 
effectiveness at using the target language and developing a good learning conversation. It will be a bit of 
work but it will be very good for your language development as large amounts of reading and listening 
with content that you mostly understand is the best way to acquire a language and the best way to prepare 
you to start speaking with confidence.
Use. This table to plan and organise your content to create your EOT lessons:
Stage
Aims
Tools
Language Input
Set the task and aims of the lesson
Introduce the language and vocabulary 
necessary to complete the task
Create online cloud folders (e.g. a cloud 
store like Google Drive) for your lesson 
content documents and write a simple 
plan for each lesson.
Out There Activity
Provide yourself with exposure to the target 
language (Input) and the opportunity to 
practise the target language with native 
speakers (your PLN)
Face-to-face or online using Skype, 
Google Hangouts or another voice 
application and record it
Result
Demonstrate to yourself that learning has taken 
place through the completion of the task. Listen 
to your recordings again two or three times.
Post audio recordings of your online 
speaking practice sessions into the 
relevant cloud folders that contain your 
lesson content. Listen to yourself three 
or four times
However, if this all sounds like a lot of work and you want to make it as easy as possible for yourself to 
do some EOT you can just buy some inexpensive tried and tested lesson worksheets. The worksheets 
will guide you at the right level and give you interesting and useful things to talk about, new vocabulary 
and a proper course structure.
To do what Liliana did (i.e. do a whole course level) just decide what your current speaking level is (you 
know better than any tester, really!) and buy one self-study level (SS) HERE, download it and use this 
ebook manual with it.
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

I Still Can’t Speak English

Getting Going
To do what Jane did (i.e. start very low and jump up levels quickly) just buy the complete (all six levels) 
of self-study courses HERE. If your first language is Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian or Spanish 
choose the complete set for that language and the beginner and elementary levels will have instructions 
in both English and your first language so that you know exactly what to do.
And if you would rather start your EOT experience with some friendly support and guidance from 
another person (i.e. an experienced EOT teacher), which is fine, because some people like a little help to 
get going, you can pay for really affordable and expert lessons called TEACHER supported EOT lessons. 
To email me send to help@englishoutthere.com.
Once you have created your own EOT lessons you will have a great highly personalized course that you 
can access from anywhere on any device and will never have to buy another expensive English course 
again. Oh, and it will actually work this time too. As you use your lessons and improve you will naturally 
increase the level of the new lessons you create at your own learning speed.
You now have all the information you need to speak English comfortably. That’s all there is to it! After 
all of those years of trying and failing Jane and Liliana became comfortable speakers of English by just 
doing things differently. Jane and Liliana are typical of millions and millions of English learners. And 
that means you can do it too, finally.

Dear Luis, 
 
How are you? How are the lessons going? I arrived in Cape Town a couple of weeks ago and it’s fantastic. It’s 
such a beautiful city! I’m living in a small flat near the harbour. From the balcony I have a view of the sea and 
from the kitchen window I can see Table Mountain. 
 
You know that I came here to continue my English studies. I haven’t started any courses yet but tomorrow I’m 
going to visit the local university to see if it offers any part-time English courses. I’m also going to try to get a 
part–time job in a café or restaurant because then I can speak English a lot more. I’m going to listen to the 
radio a lot because I still find listening to English quite difficult.  
 
I’m going to read too. I’m going to read a newspaper every day and I’m also going to buy some novels and 
read them in English. Do you know any good English novels? I’m also going to write a weblog in English – 
that’s a good way to practise my written English. I hope you’re going to read it on the internet! 
 
Hope to hear from you soon,  
Carlos

Task Sheet 1 (continued)
Men still leave the housework to women 
Jeevan Vasagar
Friday July 6, 2001
The Guardian
Men pay lip service to equal rights in the home while letting women do three-quarters of the household chores, 
new research suggests. However, women who are career high-flyers do substantially less than women in 
lower-paid work, the study shows. Every £10,000 increase in a woman‟s annual income reduces the time she 
spends on chores every week by nearly two hours.
An Oxford University researcher, Man-yee Kan, discovered that women still did the bulk of the housework – on
average more than 18 hours a week, compared with about six hours for the average man. The survey, of 
2,000 couples, did not count childcare as housework, but looked at the division of labour in unpaid household 
work such as cooking, cleaning and grocery shopping. Ms Kan found that men were not much more inclined to 
pitch in around the home if their partners worked long hours.
The factors which did make a difference were the woman‟s earning power, how educated she was, and how 
young. This was because a higher income gave a woman more bargaining power in the family, according to 
Ms Kan. Being able to buy more household goods did not make a difference, she said. “Most of the studies 
since the introduction of new technology have found that machines don‟t help to reduce workload. If you raise 
efficiency, you raise people‟s expectations. If you have a washing machine, you wash more often rather than 
once a week.”
However, educated women tended to do less housework than women who had left school at 16, the study 
showed. Working women with degrees spent about two hours less on chores than working women in 
households where both partners had only O levels or CSEs. Ms Kan suggested this was because better-
educated women had a more egalitarian approach to how much of the housework their men ought to do. The 
same applied to younger couples.
Ms Kan, who presents her study at a conference at the Institute for Social and Economic Research, University 
of Essex, today, said: “Men are taking a much more egalitarian attitude, but it seems that women are still doing 
the lion‟s share of the housework. “The attitude has changed, but now we need to say to men – if you think this 
way, then go and do it.”
Ms Kan said previous studies had showed that women tended to do the routine jobs around the house, such 
as ironing, while men opted for the non-routine work.
The writer Fay Weldon, in whose household the division of labour includes her husband taking out the rubbish
while she cleans up the cat sick, said that such studies missed the fact that housework could be fun. “More 
women like doing housework than men. It‟s a nesting instinct. Some women don‟t and don‟t do any, but more 
men don‟t care what the house looks like. Women who are better off just employ other women to do the 
housework – the rich have to find the energy to earn more money. The idea is that housework is a terrible 
burden, but it is just something you do to make your house look nice.”
