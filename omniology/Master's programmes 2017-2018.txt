We innovate
Since gaining university status in 1975, Linköping 
University has worked with inno­vation in educa­
tion and research. We are renowned for creating 
degree programmes that give valuable cross­
disciplinary know­ledge, for example combining 
medicine and engineering or computer science 
and statistics. Valuable knowledge for 
today’s and tomorrow’s society. 
We want our students to take an active role in 
learning. We aim to stimulate independent and 
critical thinking by nurturing problem-solving 
abilities. We seek to implement an innovative 
educational approach grounded in real-world 
systems and products.
We have several world-class research environ­
ments, for instance in materials science, bio­
electronics and information technology. Our 
graduates and researchers have developed ideas 
that have led to successful spin-off companies 
such as Sciss, IFS and Sectra.
Why study at 
Linköping University?
We collaborate
Linköping University collaborates with top 
universities across the globe, both in research 
and in student exchange. We have more than 500 
partner universities, including Stanford University, 
University of Washington, Nanyang Technological 
University and LMU Munich. Some of our 
master’s programmes – Adult Learning and 
Global Change, Experimental and Medical 
Biosciences, International and European Relations 
– are given in cooperation with universities in 
other countries.
We work closely with many companies. Saab, 
ABB and the Swedish National Road and 
Transport Research Institute are just a few of 
our strategic partners.
We rank highly
The Swedish higher education system as a whole 
is ranked number five in the world and Sweden 
currently ranks as number one globally for 
English proficiency. Among the 20,000 universities 
in the world Linköping University is in the top 
300. We are also among the world’s 50 best

Linköping and Norrköping, situated in East Sweden, have much to offer in 
terms of landscape, tourist attractions, entertainment and more. With around 
150,000 inhabitants, Linköping is Sweden’s fifth largest city. It has a well­
developed business sector but retains the charm of a smaller town. Slightly 
smaller, Norrköping has a lively cultural scene, including lots of live 
music festivals. Everything is within walking distance and it is very easy to 
find something fun to do. The cities are in the process of developing into 
one integrated urban region and the area is not only home to the university 
but also to several internationally well-known companies, including 
Saab, Erics­son, Siemens, Holmen Paper, BT In­dustries and Electrolux.

Santiago Sanchez from Ecuador studies Biomedical 
Engineering, he likes the informal relation with 
the lecturers.
“The relation with the teachers here is more 
friendly and you call them by their first name. 
In Ecuador you need to use title and surname, 
which contributes to a more formal relation. In 
Sweden, when you have any questions you can 
just email the professor. I was really surprised to 
receive an answer just an hour later. In Ecuador 
it would take at least a few days and then the 
questions are no longer relevant.”
several times.” He appreciates how the university 
has chosen to empower the students. “Back 
home in Nigeria, if you don’t do as a teacher 
says they have the power to fail you. In Sweden, 
during written exams, the students are anony­
mous so the lecturer can’t tell who’s who. My 
time in Sweden has become something more 
than an education. Living and studying here 
has given me a whole new perspective on life.”
Sarah Collis from Australia studies Child­hood 
Education. She was surprised by how differently 
the course was implemented.
“At first it felt a lot easier than it actually was. In 
Australia we read a lot on our own and then usu­
ally sit and listen to the teacher in a very traditional 
manner. But after studying at LiU for a while it hit 
me. Together, we as students can share and develop 
our philosophies and practices and really get to 
know the why behind the how. So even though I 
am doing less reading and work by myself I feel 
like I am owning my education now.

Adeyemi Adedokun from Nigeria studies Intelli­

the examination system at LiU is generous 
and forgiving.
“Sweden and Nigeria has very different views on 
failing. When you write an exam in Nigeria and 
fail you have to wait another year to write it 
again. In Sweden you can rewrite the exam

Mohammad Mirazul Islam, Bangladesh
Place of residence: Linköping and 
Stockholm, Sweden.   
Nationality: Bangladeshi.
Work: PhD student at Karolinska Institutet.
Current working activities: I am currently doing 
a PhD at Karolinska Institutet, where I am continuing 
the research on development of artificial corneas 
that I started during my master’s programme in 
Linköping University. We have success­fully trans­
planted our artificial corneas into 10 patients in 
Sweden. The first trial was in patients without 
microbial attacks but now I am looking at how the 
material needs to be adapted to work in patients 
with severe disease conditions. The new improved 
artificial corneas, made by me, are already in pati­
ents and the preliminary result shows improved 
vision from post-operative condition.
Education at LiU: Master in Medical Biosciences.  
Most memorable LiU experience: The Problem 
Based Learning approach was a new experience. 
At first I was skeptical. There were lots of open 
discussions, large groups brainstorming and then 
summarising the work.  It helped in the big per­
spective; it spread the knowledge in the student 
group when we shared our own knowledge, which 
is what working in research is all about.
Some LiU alumni have embraced 
academia, while others have chosen 
a career in industry, either in Sweden 
or in other countries around the globe.

engaging with two major tasks, one is analysis 
and sharing the inference on big data samples 
and second is working with interesting people.  
Education at LiU: Master in Industrial 
Engineering & Management.  
Most memorable LiU experience: I have plenty 
to share; the top most includes late night group 
studies at the university. Lot of cycling in and 
around Linköping city, only in summer! Meeting 
students from around the globe and travelling 
to a few European countries along with best
